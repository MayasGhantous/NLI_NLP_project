  only the rich can afford to have children . 
  the amount of `` wtf per minute '' is out of the scale . 
  800 $ in [ lacasitos ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fzrgzrvpld8/t4mcymwa5ki/aaaaaaaadg8/frzjpkr7g10/s320/lacasitos.jpg ) 3000 $ in a pony , that could explain alicia s\u00e1nchez origins ... 
  and yet , it 's actually the same hour in solar time . 
  that 's what happens when you force people in barcelona to use the same time zone than in krak\u00f3v ... be happy that people wakes up two hours before sunrise , but do n't expect them to eat at `` the correct hours '' because the clocks are all wrong . 
   why have the catalans never taken up arms in a big way like the basque ? 
  the basques have always been the docile ones !, 
  that 's why they keep their privileges from the middle ages , for their submissiveness , their `` loyalty '' and being always `` the obedient good boys '' . 
  how they have managed to get that image of combatants is beyond me . 
  to be fair , they do n't speak spanish either . 
   `` pasha tete tas t\u00f3 loko o k '' or  `` hoygan kmo se ase par asuvir un bideo de yutuve de kalida proque lo ise i no me lo beo vonito , mi jotmail s analfabetofande4jonatica@hotmail.com grasias d antebraso , perdnen las diskulpas '' do n't even parse as sentences and they say stuff like that non stop . 
  check the comments . 
   jjoo madrid 2020 o `` los juegos del hambre '' madrid 2020 olympic games or `` the hunger games '' . 
  it 's so true and sad that i laughed . 
  not bad ... but `` perezoso '' means lazy and `` en qu\u00e9 a\u00f1o '' means ` in which year ' . 
  the rest is perfect . 
  is this a joke ? 
  spain is fucked up beyond measure . 
  no one who leaves will ever return . 
  as a poet once wrote : `` spain , why do you have so many sons if you ca n't love them all ? 
  i 'm also surprised . 
  34 \u00b0 is within the `` hot but still bearable '' range . 
  merci !, 
  i 've found plane tickets from oviedo to madrid for a bit less than 400 $ . 
  anyway , that 's a robbery !, 
  the thing that makes it really strange is than for 200 $ more , you could fly to ... denver for instance . 
  that 's half the world away when comparing distances . 
  the prices do n't make sense . 
  could you tell us the name of the show , please ? 
  share the fun !, 
  [ i wish you do n't mind ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext/comments/1gnb5m/now_we_just_need_merkel_in_a_domination_get_up/ ) but i could n't resist to post it in / r/nocontext, 
  hahaha !, 
  andalusian , a person from [ andalusia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andalusia ) . 
   the only phone fee i can think about in europe is that when you go to another country that 's exactly it . 
  the current situation was outrageous . 
  if you lived in a border area , you could get screwed for something like receiving a picture while you 're buying the bread in france . 
  or , do you remember the case of the andalusian who got billed ~ 50k for a week in andorra ? 
  that 's not going to happen ever again , good news !, 
  do n't bother asking / u/tearsdrinker said the same about austria and malta . 
  i did n't understand it then , and i do n't understand it now either . 
  anecdote i actually know someone who went to germany , stayed there a year working and came back . 
  his reasons ? 
  the weather , the people and `` the mediterranean life '' ^ tm . 
  he found a job , but after a month he changed his mind . 
  `` this is a shitty job , the wage is pathetic . 
  i 'm sick of the heat . 
  i was earning more in germany . 
  fuck it !, 
  i 'm going there again '' ( sic ) . 
  / anecdote how many of the people that leave germany return again ? 
  but i was talking specifically about the population density distribution in iberia . 
  that 's what makes madrid an exception . 
  obviously , in other geographical areas people are distributed differently for other reasons . 
  i studied almost for free . 
  but , i had to pass all my classes at the first try with a qualification of 7.5 / 10 or higher , and work 4 hours a day in a lab helping people coursing phd or master degrees . 
  some of them taught me more than the actual classes . 
  so , was it free ? 
  not really , i paid it by being a good student and by working for peanuts for the university . 
  and i know people who studied in the same country , but in a different university but they did n't have the opportunity of doing what i was doing . 
  yes , the situation is complicated and diverse . 
  in the defence of the people of this side of the atlantic , i have to say that every time someone writes about college education in the us the issue of student loans arises . 
  and people is always complaining about how are they going to pay student loans for years and years . 
  the image of the situation we have might be distorted as your comment implies , but we have reasons to believe that education is very expensive in the us because there are a lot people complaining about it . 
  historically , living near the coast has provided more economical opportunities , namely commerce and fishing . 
  so , people has had always lived near the sea . 
  besides , once you 're `` far '' enough from the sea and its softening effect disappears ; you 'll notice how much the weather sucks . 
  madrid is the exception . 
  in 1561 a king had the strange idea that the capital should be in the middle of the peninsula , before that it was a shepherds village ... 
  in the case of iberia , check out the population density . 
  most of the whiteness is due to the fact that most people live within the strip of land 80 km from the coast , and madrid . 
  [ a map of population density ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f5pgjqx.jpg ) [ a nocturne map ] ( http://spaceinimages.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2012/03/night_lights_in_europe/10102843-2-eng-gb/night_lights_in_europe.gif ), 
  exactly the same could be said about wert . 
  maybe , he has more important issues than ` espanolizar ' catalan children ... 
  there is no enye in my keyboard . 
  these news are from 2009 . 
  the results that i 've posted are from 2010 . 
  maths and science are language agnostic disciplines , the results are bad because the teachers are bad . 
  or teaching things unrelated with their education ; for instance my physics professor was chemists , my maths professor was a physicist and my chemistry teacher had a degree in biology , and so on . 
  that 's the real problem . 
  it has nothing to do with the language . 
  average lecture comprehension points of catalan children : 498 spanish average : 481 oecd average : 491 now , above average is a disgrace ...  you could also say that the `` catalan immersion '' education is an attempt by the radical catalan nationalist to divide the spanish society in two , as an attempt to prevent that catalan-speaking children learn to speak spanish properly . 
  buf , spain has been divided since forever . 
  there are the ones who do n't want to be spanish and the ones who want to force the others to became spanish no matter the price . 
  the linguistic immersion is just an attempt to bring some peace and harmony into the cluster fuck . 
   strange , it 's rather the catalan nationalists who tend to put obstacles to spanish-language education these days the current immersion system is the only one that ensures that children from both catalan speaking families and spanish speaking families end their education speaking both . 
  the `` spanish language '' education is an attempt by the radical unionist to divide the catalan society in two , is an attempt to prevent that the spanish speaking children learn to speak catalan properly . 
  they can sugar coat it as much as they want , nobody is buying their arguments . 
  only thirteen ( 13 ) children asked to study in spanish . 
  do you think that we should force thousands to study in spanish because of 13 ? 
  because that 's what the sentence of the courts says . 
  one child who wants the class in spanish , all the others forced to study in spanish . 
  yes . 
  you should see the allergic reactions some people have to catalan : foam in the mouth , shaking , nervous ticks in the eye ... while they yell : `` in spain everything should be written in spanish '' or `` speak spanish , polish dog ( sic ) '' . 
  the unionists are the same everywhere . 
  after the first five years of service , they can become french if the choose so . 
  in the meantime , i 'm not sure . 
  there is at least one american working as instructor in the french foreign legion ( that 's a branch of the french army ) and he ranked very high . 
  how he can work for the french government ? 
  what should i get over ? 
  the 40 years of backwardness , the christofascits indoctrination that even nowadays impregnates every aspect of society , the parasitic extractive families that have looted the country for decades , the dictator heir and company stealing every thing they can and more ?
