  the democracy index ranks countries on an overall score based on 5 criterias : * electoral process and pluralism * functioning of government * political participation * political culture * civil liberties these ranks are calculated based on 60 criterias on a country . 
  the evaluation given are described as `` expert assessments '' . 
  all eu countries get a score above 9 in `` electoral process and pluralism '' and above 8.5 `` civil liberties '' , so that 's not the issue . 
  score is given from 1 to 10 , 10 being the highest . 
  if the overall score is below 8 , the country is considered a flawed democracy . 
  above 8 is a `` full democracy '' . 
  below 6 is a hybrid regime ( think hong kong or singapore ) and below 4 is an authoritarian regime ( china , dprk ) . 
  ranked from least flawed to most flawed : * portugal , overall score ** 7.81 ** . 
  low score in `` political participation '' ( 6.11 ) * france , ** 7.77 ** . 
  low score in `` political participation '' ( 6.11 ) * slovenia , ** 7.76 ** . 
  but 6.25 in `` political culture '' * italy , ** 7.74 ** . 
  6.43 in `` functioning of government '' * greece , ** 7.65 ** . 
  5.71 in `` functioning of government '' * estonia , ** 7.61 ** . 
  low score in `` political participation '' ( 5.00 ) * slovakia , ** 7.35 ** . 
  5.00 in political culture , 5.56 in political participation * cyprus , ** 7.29 ** - 6.11 in political culture , 5.63 in political culture . 
  * lithuania , ** 7.24 ** low in functioning of govt ( 5.71 ) and political participation ( 5.56 ) * poland , ** 7.12 ** low in political participation ( 5.00 ) and political culture ( 6.25 ) * latvia , ** 7.05 ** , low in functioning of govt ( 5.36 ) , political participation ( 5.56 ) and political culture ( 5.63 ) * hungary , ** 7.04 ** , very low in political participation ( 4.44 ) * bulgaria , ** 6.78 ** very low in political culture ( 4.38 ) . 
  * romania , ** 6.54 ** very low in political culture ( 4.38 ) and political participation ( 4.44 ) basically , eu citizens all live in countries with good civil liberties and free and fair elections . 
  the issues are in political participation ( in a lot of countries , people do n't care about the elections ) , functioning of government ( corruption , inefficiencies ) , and political culture ( which is mainly in former eastern block countries where it is understandable ) . 
  highest overall score : norway , 9.8 . 
  ( fun fact : norway is not a real country . 
  it is a political ploy to make you feel like something better would be possible ) .

  oh for the love of god , stop doing that !, 
  when will one french government have the courage to stand up to the ~ 2 % of voters who work in agriculture ? 
  i do n't get why this lobby is so powerful ... 
   priority in case of a blood donation , that is free honestly this one is a little scary ... 
  i give regularly but my cousin ca n't because she 's too light ( < 50kg ) . 
  why should i get priority over her in case of an accident ? 
  really ? 
  how frequent are we talking here ? 
  well , look at is this way : the chinese will make planes , whether we help them or not . 
  might as well make some money on the way . 
  there are many types of roma in france . 
  a very large proportion lives and works in france very much legally with little to no problems : they have french citizenship and have special rights given their nomadic lifestyle . 
  they are called `` gens du voyage '' or `` journey people '' . 
  they are roma , but most have been in france for generations , and they are descendants of the nomadic gypsies you find in many stories/movies here . 
  the roma who are expelled are a different case : they are of romanian citizenship and emigrated to france fairly recently . 
  before 2007 , a large number of them came to france illegally ( as romania was n't a member of the eu ) . 
  they now come legally , but under the special status that bulgaria and romania are in right now , they ca n't work legally in france ( or other eu countries for that matter ) . 
  that will change soon , as the special status should be revoked in the coming years . 
  until that time , they have to apply for a working permit like other non-eu citizen , and those permits are limited to a few professions . 
  the new left-wing has done and is doing a few things to try and help them integrate better . 
  the number of professions open to foreigners was reduced by the previous government from 120 to 22 ; the current government has reverted that measure so the number is once again 120 . 
  there are talks of opening more professions to the roma . 
  that said , to continue with these useless and costly expulsions is a real let down . 
  they are useless as these people can once again come legally to france . 
  they are costly as we pay every person who returns to romania 300 euros ( half for children ) , and the trip back ... 
  i had hoped the socialists would instead try integration measures . 
  hopefully , the current actions were more due to political inertia in the ministry . 
  as for an actual solution ... not easy integration of the roma is a big issue all across europe , as is [ antiziganism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiziganism ) . 
  like with most problem between communities , there is no silver bullet . 
  personnally , i believe that equal access to education will go a long way . 
  teaching french would also help , as would an access to the job centers we have here i guess . 
  i hope hollande and manuel valls will try different things , see what works ... 
  great point !, 
  i 've often thought that the eu gave opportunities to people like jean-claude juncker , viviane reding , olli rehn , etc. 
  who make me feel as though they are `` too big '' for their countries . 
  it would have been a shame to confine these people to helping only their country when they can have an impact on 500 million lives . 
  actually it did n't , despite all the predictions to the contrary . 
  no reason to expect it would be different for romania and bulgaria . 
  the manneken pis in brussels . 
  the thing is known for being underwhelming . 
  i knew that , i prepared myself and i was still uderwhelmed . 
  however , it 's right next to the grand place which is a sight to see . 
  my point is simply that illegal immigration is n't nearly as much of a problem as most crimes . 
  hell , speeding causes more deaths than illegal immigration every year , but gets much much less attention . 
  i hate that we spend so much money trying to fix an unfixable non-problem . 
   i hope you 're not implying that anyone who 's against illegal immigration is a racist ? 
  no , just that the reason for the previous laws is that sarkozy was trying to please the racist fringes . 
  moderates who are against illegal immigration do n't choose their candidate based solely on this issue , only the far-right does . 
  too much of our resources are spent on this `` problem '' . 
  illegal immigration is the * only * offense which requires the judge to give a verdict within a fixed time frame ( 4 weeks ) . 
  the result is verdicts that are given without proper inquiry ( resulting in a few rebuttals from the european court of human rights ) . 
  this also is quite a drain on our the budget of the ministry of justice at the expense of judging people commiting actual crimes . 
  up until last week children were detained in our retention centers , which have abhorrent living conditions . 
  i voted for hollande in the hope that he would once again make france a country that take care of immigrants instead of throwing people back out just because the racist fringes of our country ca n't handle different cultures . 
  i 'm glad he 's delivering , and i can only hope he will go even further . 
  our national motto is liberty , equality , fraternity . 
  helping immigrants should be our duty . 
  edit : vocab, 
  personnally , i care as much for the chinese workers as the local workers . 
  hell , the french unemployed can rely on the social security net ; chinese people ca n't . 
  if french and other european companies want me to buy their products , they 'd better give me a better reason than `` we were born closer to where you were born '' .

  just showed it to my chinese girlfriend . 
  she does n't speak cantonese so could only understand a few words . 
  her impression was that , though it is slightly over the top , it 's a fairly common metaphor . 
  to the chinese , and i guess a lot of people in east asia , sports is about winning and crushing the opponent . 
  another example of this sentiment would be what the north korean team said before facing portugal during the last world cup : `` we are here to take revenge for our last encounter '' . 
  that encounter was 20 years earlier ...

  people who only know the stereotype of the mexican deep in siesta say the mexicans are lazy . 
  this stereotype probably stems from the cultural difference between spanish origins where naptime is important and english origins where adults do n't nap . 
  or we have homer , in response to the greek crisis . 
  hollande ( cleverly ) never went in any detail other than the fact that he want a renegotiation aimed at growth rather than austerity . 
  the main thing on which he was very clear with that is that he wanted the renegotiation before applying the treaty in france . 
  i voted for hollande in the second round . 
  renegotiation of the fiscal pact is one of the things i hoped he would n't do once he became president . 
  let 's hope this is just pandering for the upcoming elections ( legislature ) and goes under the rug afterwards . 
  good news for hollande .
