  ( that and the fact they 'll somehow pass `` christian america '' laws 2 days in if they succeed in getting elected potus+h ouse , just you see ), 
  you do n't need to be evil to do incredible damage . 
  just to be incompetent or not paying attention ( for example because some of the crooks are your boss or campaign superpac funder ) and let the crooks get away with hold ups ( entire chunks of the budget looted ) perpetually bigger , then blame the poles for `` getting too much welfare '' as the supposed cause of the missing money . 
  in the us , trump do the same with mexicans and people who depend on foot stamp money to eat everydays while he 's swapping millions and billions with a few 1 % ers behind the gop . 
   i 'm an optimist so i do n't think he 'd go full retard in office ( ... ) he was smart enough to build his empire , even with all the ebin maymays from john oliver and the like . 
  well johnson started buying his own propaganda , and there we are . 
  he 's not `` retarded '' , but repeat a lie enough and people start believe it regardless if they do n't have constantly proof of the contrary under their eyes . 
  like , at some point the torries conservative wing ( the `` brexit '' people ) started believing that they were still a major or even net contributor to the eu , despite stealing themselves most of the uk contributions toward the eu budget ( and part of the welfare , and `` corporate subsidies '' , and ... ) since they got margaret thatcher elected . 
  the fact they covered it up to avoid prison and could n't publickly disavow themselves let alone clean their own house ( instead of asking each others for their own cut , romania style ) certainly did n't helped . 
   i believe this is how a trump presidency would be like . 
  it would probably depends on what he actually do . 
  if he closes the border and ban mexicans/muslims/whatever and go like johnson , yeah the economy would take a 20 % hit and a year later our dear euros would be worth 2 $ . 
  if he start deporting mexicans and `` foreigners '' , he 'll have half of border america ( i mean anything close to the border , like new mexico , florida , cali ) in catastrophic economy trouble ( probably half of california 's workers are `` foreigners '' , no joke . 
  it always was the place to go for somebody trying to get a foot in the door in the usa and start , there and nyc ) . 
  what i mean by that is look at that pic : http://imgur.com/8vnxbpm if you remove all the qualified people that help run your country by doing hard work because they 're foreigners , turns out things will go to worse conditions . 
  on the other hand , if he rises welfare & minimal wage , leave working ppl alone , make the richest pay normal taxes ( ie stop panama fraud ) & maintain trade , it could turn correctly . 
  however that twould make the `` supply side free market '' republicans screaming at him ; because their conservative backers ( who have very much the same mentality than the `` brexit '' torry conservative in the uk ) would interpretate it as backpedaling and some ( ... 
  most ? ), 
  of them are more interested in abolishing tax for themselves , cutting the obama care to embezzle the cashflow as corporate subsidies to themselves while saying it 's to `` protect the free market '' , and hiding money abroad via panama than fixing the country . 
  as for the `` we 'll build a wall and make mexico pay for it '' ; well i suspect it might fly even worse than the uk leaving our market but the thing is now the events are n't written in marble , it 's not set in stone ; ( or we likely would n't be having this conversation ) . 
  so we can only speculate on the biggest known possibilities . 
  ^ ^ well ^ ^ i ^ ^ guess ^ ^ the ^ ^ scotts ^ ^ and ^ ^ irish ^ ^ do ^ ^ have ^ ^ an ^ ^ accent ^ ^ strong ^ ^ enough ^ ^ it ^ ^ is ^ ^ almost ^ ^ another ^ ^ language ^ ^ :d, 
  some of the references and wording in that text suggest to me it is definitely a real eu-written paper . 
  and i definitely like what i 'm reading in it to be honest  ( for the sake of records no we wo n't drag the uk in it , the agreement passed with mr cameron explicitely prohibits pressuring them into an ever closer union . 
  albeit security and various cooperation as a third party country will always be welcome . ), 
  edit : some people suggest the polish website 's interpretation around the eu document is blatantly false ( i did n't bothered running it through translation ; and only readed the english document scanned , sorry ) edit : will give it another re read a bit later after a proper night of sleep ( i just skimmed right now , sorry ), 
   how serious is the leavers 's claim that france will follow suite and leave ? 
  lulz . 
  makewishing and fantasy  ? 
  i know fn wants out the fn is a fringe far right party that wants a lot of things . 
  well , let 's work toward fixing that mess then . 
  better than just spend our lives bickering i 'd hazard . 
  we 'll have to wait for the new pm to be official 'd in tho . 
  well yeah their only plan was to threathen the eu into giving them more money and opt outs and deregulation and covering even more of their fraud and theft with lies and lies everywhere . 
  ( e.g : stealing 1.6 b ( as in 1 ' 600 ' 000 ' 000 $ ) from the eu contribs , then blamming the poles for the missing money by `` abusing by sending money back to their family in poland for their kids to eat '' by pushing stuff like that in the press : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9628945/more-than-40000-children-abroad-getting-child-benefit.html then clamoring for welfare optouts while insulting foreigners . 
  while buying yet another castle with their own recent theft . 
  just a great mentality . 
  then unsurprizingly they do n't like the eu poking their nose into all that so add in another dash of national sovereignty being `` trampled by the evil eu '' and all in the press . ), 
  guess they had to import another honorary citizen to meet numbers xd, 
   why ? 
  you are not even in it . 
  it 's as cringy as repeating `` confederate states of america '' or hanging a flag upside down . 
  it 's going to cause people to yell a bit . 
   stop being frenchgermanitalian and instead become part of a huge eu superstate where your elected leader may not even speak your language ? 
  for what it 's worth , and `` we 're all speaking german '' crass jokes apart ; there use to be 3 + main languages ( and possibly [ dozens of sub dialects ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4f/47/be/4f47be19a376c699de6249af681afded.jpg ) ) in france a couple centuries ago ~ ~ and even more recently ( you can still hear it in the accents of various regions ) ~ ~ . 
  it got simplified by paris that pushed for a single one instead via sponsoring schools and stuff . 
  now the way they set up to do it in france was sometime absurd and abusive , i do n't disagree with that and we should not go for a blind & idiotic repeat of the means to do it because the way they handled it in bretagne in france to reduce the use of for example [ breton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breton_language ) ( dead as a prime language but that still exist fully documented with dictionnaries and litterature and stuff and some hundreds of thousands of speakers who know it as a second language for anyone interested in old things ... ) ; the way used to reduce it was unacceptable . 
  but the idea of teaching a common language for everyone to be able to communicate , on top of their native one , be it english even if the uk are officially out , do n't shock me . 
  ( and i say that as a native french speaker , i have to admit that if i did n't learnt english i probably would n't be writing this message ), 
  it 's gon na take decades as a slow ever closer thing . 
  it 's not an overnight thing . . 
  i would go as far as saying an `` instant '' change would lead to nothing good . 
  stick to the official roadmap  we could save a lot of money by not paying 27 national and 1 supernational goverment , i suspect the local govs will stay for the same reason there are states and generally elected governors in the usa and landers in germany . 
  it 's just simpler to have locals run things and local issues they know better in their own corner ( while federal powers set limits to prevent abuse like when some retarded states decide to refuse social security or similar for religious reasons ) . 
  there might simply be overtime a slow transfert of some powers like foreign affairs to federal authorities like in the usa . 
  federal authorities that are likely to be run for at least a long time by the elected leaders of the various eu countries + a central `` deadlock breaker '' president ( elected directly by an eu wide citizen vote ) . 
  the eu parliament is obviously in to stay ( sorry palpatine , nobody 's going to have a `` dissolve the senate muhaha '' phase ) . 
   we could also save some money on a european army . 
  there is a budding eurocorps getting built ( glorious 6 thousands soldiers and 10k ppl strong corp ) and some transferts of ressources towards it ; but some countries will want to keep their own national armies to stay capable of somewhat handling some of their own affairs independantly without dragging the whole eu in it everytime ( e.g : in syria a lot of countries would somewhat rightly refuse to intervene because they have nothing to do with it - hard to blame them for it - , while other like france or gb decided sovereignly to go in with the usa ) . 
  obviously others are going to go full baltic and say `` hi nato thanks for handling everything for us '' but that 's not a mandated ( - or even good \u00e8_\u00e9 - ) thing . 
  so , the building of an eu army is not going to immediately save money . 
  it 's a parrallele thing . 
  but some standardization and simplification might , tho . 
  like having the same standard assault rifle for most of the eu armies . 
  ps : stahp with that fugly name :d it 's eu !, 
  or europa !, 
   please do it before they appoint boris johnson as pm . 
  for all it 's worth , cameron might initially have started even worse than johnson ( but shhhh do n't tell him ! ) . 
  from an external point of view he largely and continuously got better at it over the last few years . 
  i guess i kind of understand why people say it takes 4 years for a president or pm to learn how to do his job . 
  maybe it 's the time needed to find out what is really possible to reform and what is not . 
   only reinforced an image of the eu as a club of aging conservatives , devoid of ideas and spine . 
  i assumed the `` brexit '' side was a club of aging conservatives devoid of plans and very uncompromizing on their stance . 
  oh well there might have been no perfect answer there tbh . 
   it 's better to say `` rest in peace , uk '' . 
  they 're not quite jumping the sharks already xd i suspect there will be widespread damage to the country but let 's not exagerate it 's not quite venezuela either haha . 
  they might end up like italy or spain imho ( which are n't disappearing either by any standards , despite their problems and poverty , they 're still first world tiers ) . 
   in northern ireland , brexit threatens to upset the fragile peace between the country 's various communities . 
  ( ... ) the uk exit will probably awaken tensions that could lead to new violence . 
  i dunno , i disagree as of now . 
  while they yell `` independancy '' like the scotts , looks to me they look for it the peacefull way throught voting booths , not violence . 
   europeans may not know what to do with this opportunity . 
  that 's not true . 
  it 's just that `` federalism '' is a swear word so the subject was n't very discussed out loud . 
  but it 's not like the idea was top secret either , anyone that even half try can discover the interest of some of our leaders in a federal europe . 
  it 's just unlike the `` brexit '' it 's not perpetually on tv prime time . 
  but good point , maybe that 's part of the issue, 
   i hope the eu forces them to get on with article 50 , no messing about . 
  it 's painful enough already that something unnecessary has happened . 
  i think we 're going to wait for the new pm to be elected before pressuring out and first try honest negociations ( the referendum was won fair & square and it was honestly nice not to see any fraud attempt . 
  let 's do our best to keep it clean & professional to the end of that story line as much as we can shall we ? 
   altho if by the end of year 2016 / beggining 2017 the uk has done nothing after 6 months of new pm there might be internal pressure for a 50 and i dunno how we 'll react for sure ( depends on who get elected and how he 'll react and/or what he 'll decide/ask from us i guess ), 
  yeah but the ukip & conservative where ... very ... vocal about leaving and by yesterday because they felt oppressed by bruxelles . 
  esp johnson & farage . 
  litterally the posterboys of brexit . 
  ironically , by now , the market is the only thing that seems to interest the uk in the eu, 
   the uk puts in $ 30b a year and gets back around $ 10b . 
  you forgot entirely market access , infrastructure subsidies that are subsidies `` in nature '' ( no more eu-paid free highways and free water pipes and free optical fibers and ... ) ; cereal bought at price well above market price to help uk farmers ( then resold below price at eastern europe to feed romanians ) ; etc etc. 
   the french market growth has slowed in recent months and is being propped up by the ecb . 
  lol ; that 2 % deficit in france is pretty much due to a 10 % french war & policy budget and that one 's not forever .
