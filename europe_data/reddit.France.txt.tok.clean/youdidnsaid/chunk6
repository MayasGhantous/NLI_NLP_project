   the french ca n't afford to pay more . 
  the eu will have to scale back its operations . 
  lol you 're going to be in for a surprize then . 
  we borrow at -0.5 % . 
  that mean we can borrow insane amounts of money , set it aside without touching it to pay back the loan ; and spend only the interests . 
   the eu need to find $ 20 billion they 've just lost 5-7b on french budget reduction next year , 5/7b on growth gains , add in a few fiscal correction ( megacorps frauders getting caught and starting to pay back taxes owed and yearly taxes . 
  like mcdonalds in for 2b ) , a couple billions in eurobonds , greeks being finally able to buy stuff in a couple years once they stop sending all their money abroad on debts , a few negative rates loans here and there , and there we go . 
  we also do n't need to pay any english farmers any living anymore since the uk do n't want to contribute to our budgets anymore , which also mean we 'll be able to save that much too . 
  ( oh btw i hope the ukip is thinking about putting some of that money aside in the multi billions range because otherwise there 's quite a lot of uk farmer that were only living on eu subsidies - translation : french tax money and monthly checks from us - that will be in trouble btw ) edit : i found numbers on the internet suggesting we meddling europeans where giving about 3 + billions euros a year to english farmers directly under the cap ; and that if i included advantageous price buybacks and other indirect subsidies and fiscal advantages for sales in the eu and easy market access etc , that means about 10/12 billions euros a year at stake for them . 
  on the bright side the eu can nearly easily afford that 20b loss in fact . 
  well , i would find it curious ( or at least certainly interesting ) that after going to such length to scream about their national sovereignty they would not be running anymore for the exit . 
  http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=1w owh that 's gon na leave a trace . 
  they do realize that after 10 years of blamming us for everything they just passed a binding referendum for leaving the eu , right ? 
  ... right ? 
  my apologies , i should have written `` once claimed '' , it was unfair to use you as a scarecrow . 
   my god . 
  shared sovereignty yup . 
  hence all the jokes i made about `` muh sovereignty '' . 
  that peeked in that referendum we just lost to the `` pro sovereignty '' side . 
  but hey enjoy trying to take over gibraltar . 
   why are you even considering military actions because the torry conservative just basically won power in the uk , have to prove themselves , are in full `` uk national sovereignty ! '', 
  mode , and the last time that happened thatcher was in power , and she asserted her agenda by declaring war on argentina over the falklands . 
  if gibraltar start screaming , i suspect the torries will react gan ho . 
   that 's why spain did n't ask for full sovereignty . 
  sorry for the comparison because rajoy is no putin , but russia ~ ~ claims ~ ~ once claimed a lot of territory in the baltics too . 
  does it means we 're going to grant them anything like that ? 
  so shoo with the obvious land grab attempts, 
  no need to go by the air and the spanish wo n't go that far . 
  a cargo boat costs far less and can contain far more stuff . 
  edit : it 's port frequently welcome big cruise ships : http://cms.selesti.com/new_gallery/schofield/profile%20images/shipping%20and%20marine/port%20of%20gibraltar%20issue%20100%20a.jpg so they can likely easily welcome super container ships . 
  edit : they can also possibly try getting an agreement for cargo access to algecira that has the needed infra and is deserved by maersk ( the big shipping firm ) : http://www.worldtravelserver.com/travel/en/gibraltar/gibraltar/gallery_gibraltar/photo_52556429-maersk+terminal++containerships+in+algeciras+port.html then they can use trucks to close the gap between both so to be honest they risk more facing big shipping taxes that are going to make them yell if spain feels dickish that day , than outright starvation, 
   because spain wants it back . 
  but the gibraltar people do n't want in spain . 
  they do n't feel spanish at all . 
  what they need tho is market access ( ie being able to buy food in spain ; not being force annexed . ), 
   il aurait per\u00e7u entre 100 000 euros et 450 000 euros pour avoir obtenu pour le fn un pr\u00eat avoisinant les 10 millions d'euros aupr\u00e8s d'une banque russe  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-luc_schaffhauser translation : j l schaffhauser received between 100 000 and 450 000 $ for succeeding in getting the fn a loan from that russian bank , ( first czech russian bank , aka fcrb ) . 
  lol , another corrupt russian/fn funder, 
   soros is basically responsible for brexit - without his meddling , the uk would have joined the eurozone what lol no i can say that 's outright , litterally false . 
  the uk would have left even faster and more brutally . 
  that 's conservative torry arguments to drop their brexit 's plan responsability on the opposition . 
  now we european played and lost , that 's different . 
  it was bound to happen at some point anyway . 
  anti eu resentment was building up . 
  better to have a proper uk exit in order for them opened under somebody still half reasonable , rather than waiting for an all out diplomatic war with an eu-hating briton pm that would do everything in his power to start acting aggressively and compare us to the ussr for forcing him to stay in . 
  ca fait un peu charge du moulin \u00e0 vent sur ce coup \\* grattage de menton * ( kind of charging at a windmill ... ), 
  [ alright then . 
  i have no idea . 
  the closest thing i know off and can compare is in the usa some christian right wing planned parenthood shooters using similar slogans . 
  twitter rumored of a similar white power kkk-like member , but i 'd like to wait for more proofs as of now, 
   \\ #viernheim : reports that the shooter has shouted `` jesus is coming back '' at least 20 injured ( @rt_com ) another fringe right wing nut ? 
  : - / glad there has n't been any death otherwise apparently ( but the wannabe hitman might be dead apparently ) edit  6min ago #viernheim , #germany security forces in control of situation . 
  local media report the gunman has been shot dead edit : as it stands 17:45 23 june 2016 paris time ; reportedly & apparently 1 dead shooter , dozens of `` injuries '' because the police used tear gaz generously , but not much else, 
  from what i have seen , most swiss referendums are generally on `` minor '' or medium policy questions and pretty much more officialized opinion polls . 
  when the gov is not sure which way the wind is blowing on whatever subject they just ask . 
  not a bad idea . 
  that very much depend for who and where . 
  wages are high in some big cities likes nyc , but prices there are also stupidly high ( [ with 8000 $ / month of rent ] ( http://assets.diylol.com/hfs/e83/b0a/6be/resized/too-damn-high-meme-generator-the-rent-is-too-damn-high-52014a.jpg?1311832590.jpg ) ( [ origin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rent_is_too_damn_high_party ) ) and 15 $ vegetables food being not so unfrequent ) ; so in fact with 10k there you live inferiorly than somebody in france with 2k . 
  edit i mean ; price of a single room : https://media.timeout.com/images/102832444/750/422/image.jpg edit : also , in other places where life is cheaper like flyover states , expect your income to look more like 500 to 1000 $ / mo. 
  ie not livable without housemates either who agree to share all the bills . 
  edit : the usa is also one of the few countries where a significant part of the population lives in trailers ( mobilehomes , caravans , etc ) . 
  sometimes by choice , sometime for lack of money : http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24135022 edit the `` household income '' is also another trick to hide poverty in the usa in a number of statistics . 
  where an `` household '' can be as much as 4 or more roommates and re-labelized as an `` 40k income household '' while really it 's 4 persons making 10 10 5 and 15k . 
  minimal wage in europe has been hampered down by `` free market '' pressure from the us ( `` free market '' lobbies who sometime use groups like that employer union in france , the medef , to try to blackmail laws in that sometime tries to reduce it ), 
   you kind of need economic growth for a rise in wages mate . 
  or you need to rise up the minimal wage . 
  because if you do n't , if only to follow inflation alone , companies never rise people nowadays . 
  itt people everywhere only looking at raw corporate growth while ignoring average living standards / living standard growth ( and no both are n't necessarily linked . 
  just because firms get richer do n't mean you will be ), 
   breferendoom i 'm totally stealing that one :d, 
  well the clone war sure has turned out a lot different than we all expected , especially when it did hit the mass medias, 
  we should definitely salute this courageous act by the french muslims that participated in the tribute . 
  it is good that our country and citizens shows unity against unacceptable acts of random terrorism by a minority of radicals . 
   cameron has opened pandora 's box and sooner or later there will be an utterly destructive hard right administration/internal tory putsch i think it 's unfair to blame the torries conservatives & ukip-like fringe right wing on him . 
  those guys have been around far longer than cameron . 
  ( also , as another advantage of the referendum , seeing who the people really support via a vote and to what degree it goes is necessary if only to dispell some ukip 's illusion that `` all the uk in fact hate the eu and are all forced in by euro tyranny '' ), 
   football just attracts wonderful people , really . 
  well i 'd say it 's likely that if you get yourself tattooed with a swatiska , subtlety likely is n't your forte, 
  it 's starting well . 
  well , at least we know they have the right guy . 
   to be brutally honest i find it hard good thing it 's not up to people like you then . 
  because when our rulers stop caring about us , well ... you got the shit we 're in currently . 
  irrelevant idiots ? 
  you know msf is basically one of the few organizations that dare send medical personnal in large numbers to some of the most horrible battlefields like syria/iraq right ? 
  they litterally saved tens of thousands of lives in places like aleppo or maybe you answered to the wrong people/post ? 
  \\* facepalm \\* they need all the cash they can get if they want to run their humanitarian op . 
  so let me guess . 
  they 'll instead accept funds from france that has totally not been given by the eu for that purpose ? 
   in protest at their shameful deterrence policies and their intensification of efforts to push people back from european shores , '' i think the others would have done ( and planned for ) a lot worse than just suggest they stay in turkish higher standard camps but oh well pffft i guess we 're the villains now, 
   was it true , that russia organized the big fight by giving `` fighters '' free flight to france clubs of supporters tends to help each others with tickets ( they pool money for the `` holidays '' ) . 
  i do n't think it 's state ran at all . 
  just drunk holligan semi-gangs with sometime a richer sponsor that just want an excuse to hang out and hit the ~ ~ balloon ~ ~ bottle with them . 
  it 's possible some of those rich sponsors are in putin circle , but to be fair they all are vaguely connected at some degree . 
  it 's a social class thing  black shirts to recognize each other in fight lol they just picked their `` usual '' chav ( for the english ) or vatnik ( the russian equivalent ) hoodlum attire . 
  i assume they can recognize each other by the native language  and teeth protectors ? 
  that seems bs :d but maybe a few thought of it by experience , who knows, 
  < farage  long term thinking ? 
  economic results of our actions ? 
  what is that ? 
  \\* grabs the popcorn \\*, 
  hey sure why not  they already fit all the criterias or nearly ( think norway ) .
