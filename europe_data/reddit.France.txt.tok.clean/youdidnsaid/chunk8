  sooooooo ... * litterally hitler ? 
   `` participatory regulation * ( newspeak for `` corporations will now co-write laws ) was n't that one cut out ? 
   the real threat to the precautionary principle , which is the foundation of the eu 's health and safety regulations ( in the usa , a product is banned if it causes harm . 
  in the eu , it is banned it there 's reasonable doubt that it may cause harm ) . 
  i read latest chapter on agro ( did n't read everything tho because there was too much and did n't had time ; will fall back to it one of the coming days i think ) , it was genuinely addressed . 
  they even put provisions in case of actual emergency ( read : greece failing ) and mainly attacked export subsidies ( fair enough to me ! ), 
   that they ant the eu to abandon all protectionism but they wo n't budge on the buy american act . 
  yeah and we 'll buy all their stuff with printed euros just like they once did with the chinese using dollars . 
  euros that 'll be backed partly by high tech industries helping subsidise everything & large amounts of energy . 
  they 'll even buy all our surplus and shit unsellable at european prices or because our markets are oversupplied ( e.g : german cars ; or shoes . 
  seriously german car industry is a major asset and we 'd be noobs not to capitalize on it ) which will help keeping us bordering on deflation . 
  buy american do n't apply to stuff they do n't know how to mass produce like we do . 
  both win imho . 
  imho , some of the things we should be carefull about are ( amongst other things ) : - isds ( not letting another economy pump money straight away by the billions without giving something in exchange . 
  we want a trade deal , not a `` give all our money for free to ` investors ' scams ` deal ' '' ) - and not falling to the `` ressource curse '' rendering our economy monopolar ( like the ksa that only have oil ) ~ ~ because right now our gotto solution when stuff hit the fan is tossing raw ressources at it and papering over the problem till we can pretend it does n't exist for a few more years ~ ~ . 
  we kick the can down the road way too much right now . 
  venezuella is a very dire warning of the risks of an energy centric economy that does n't have anything else and collapses when things fluke a bit too much . 
  there 's potential like the car industry in germany ; but to exploit it a trade agreement would help a lot - not addressing the social problem ( some money might have to be redistributed . 
  that means for example cash transferts toward greece or dropping some of their debt ; and that the french gov stop trying to push crazy work laws  .  ) that said , the question is still very divisive , the negociations are still ongoing , and there is no perfect answer i would assume ( i do n't know everything either ), 
  yeah that 's the biggest sticky point at first sight , the isds `` settlement '' issue ; which still risk being corporate-led courts awarding themselves larges sums of european government money and quickly devolving in ridiculous shakedowns . 
  i mean , they tried to loot 200 ' 000 ' 000 $ ( 200 millions ) from romania ( poorest country in europe . 
  poorer than detroit and porto rico . 
  and they tried to steal 200 millions . 
  what the hell . ), 
  already using similar treaties so it 's not just imaginary relevant http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2015/12/how-eu-nations-are-being-sued-for-billions-by-foreign-companies-in-secret-tribunals/ ca n't have people awarding themselves billions just because they feel like it sorry, 
  it 's called european union or europa !, 
  \\* shakes fist angrily \\* you wannabe confederates states of america !, 
   what i do n't get is why nobody fucking moves !, 
  so , is the entire 30 % of the country supposed to just drop everything and leave it ? 
  that kind of kills the country . 
  30 + % unemployment . 
  and it 'll only rise . 
  either the state can redistribute some of the tax money directly to citizens , or poverty will reach 100 % of the population along unemployment just like pre revolution times . 
  inb4 europe , the richest superpower on earth ca n't afford it / s, 
  `` teutonic cowards '' xd, 
  the paris incident is a different one and just as unacceptable . 
   attacking terrorist operatives is now equivalent to a mini 9/11 ? 
  oh so when they filled a building full of c4 in stockholm because there was a kurdish pr office there that was `` attacking terrorist operatives '' ? 
  are you all batshit insane ? 
   the turkish state has the right to attack any terrorists if the gw pull shit like that again , they will be hunted down all over europe ; and mass jailed . 
  which is n't a passright for the grey wolves fuckers to plot their own mini 9/11 in the middle of stockholm, 
  the day there are us drones blowing up ppl and buildings in paris or berlin or stockholm you tell me . 
  because right now , this is total fantasy, 
  that 's why i said `` tipsy '' and not drunk . 
  i 'm not sure about the word for `` under influence '' ? 
   remember that a big man drinking 1 liter a week is n't even necessarily an alcoholic . 
  yeah . 
  but 24x 2l bottle that 's 48l ; ie enough vodka to keep a 12 crew tispy for a 2 weeks . 
  that 's a lot of vodka haha . 
  does he plan to supply a couple squads ? 
   and also those 3 kurdish women were pkk executives no they were n't . 
  and no you ca n't assassinate people randomly in the street because you feel they are too sympathic for your ennemies by being of the wrong ethnicity . 
  and no you ca n't try to c4 buildings in european countries and say `` it 's tame '' because that 's pretty much an act of war . 
   by the way have you forgotten this ? 
  grey wolve false flag , because they failed to bomb the office straight . 
  they got caught repeatedly in sweden . 
  hence me being kind of annoyed because they pretty much acted like a terrorist group . 
   yes but grey wolves are quite tame now . 
  apart the bit where they gunned down 3 kurdish women in the streets in paris in 2013 or tried to bomb a kurdish office in sweden with explosives and grenades thrice in the last year you mean ; or the two organized violent riots in germany ? 
   but at least one is n't trying to destroy the values and foundations of this country . 
  they just want to enforce different ones . 
  just as violently as akp . 
   mhp is quite nationalist but frankly i would take nationalism over islamism any day . 
  the grey wolves ? 
  were n't they formed by actual german wwii nazis too ; another `` neo inheritence '' party like the greek [ golden dawn ] ( http://www.channel4.com/media/images/channel4/c4-news/2013/september/28/28_goldendawn_g_w.jpg ) or french `` front national '' ? 
  : / for the non familiar : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grey_wolves_%28organization%29 they have also been responsible for strings of assassinations in europe of turkish dissidents that left the country ; or various kurds that annoyed the akp gov too much . 
  the ennemy of our ennemy is not always our friend . 
  see also : talibans , isis , baathist nazis . 
  why not use `` projectile '' instead then ? 
  it can also be used to fire adapted tear gaz cannisters , but generally it 's used to stun to break rioters waves coming to close to the cops ' line . 
  imagine 20 flashball lined up targetting stomach height and you get the picture . 
  yeah i know but i mean `` missile '' here generally invocate the image of something like a hellfire or tomahawk or hamas ' home made shitty rockets . 
  so when blackblock types toss you a soda or beer can while it * technically qualify * as a missile by dictionnary standards you can just call it for what it is ( a can ) . 
  yeah it hurts to be pelted , but it 's not a firearm either . 
  i guess it 's how journalists half twist titles lol, 
  it 's a [ flashball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flash-ball ) ( stun rifle ) . 
  can still injures you badly ( or even blind you ) if hit in the face at close range, 
  lol , never happened . 
  there 's always a few crazy to toss some rocks and old soda cans at the cops, 
  not okay imho . 
  they should have bought an ad page instead if they just wanted their article published . 
  outright censorship is generally not a good idea , even in reverse, 
  nah that 's just one of the hypothesis and probably not entirely wrong . 
  their numbers ran short for some reason and then the remaining few interbreded themselves with sapiens sapiens till there was only one `` homo '' genre left ( because of too little `` independant '' genetic pool left for it to remain as a separate specie over millenias ? ), 
  edit : damn , i used more racist buzzwords in a single post than the last 6 months . 
  i feel dirty haha, 
  i always loved how people love to imagine neanderthals as `` brutish retarded humans '' . 
  something like : https://www.lesnewseco.fr/wp-content/uploads/homme-de-ne%cc%81andertal-1.jpg the old `` african inferior human '' self gratifying ( but downright retarded ) modern colonial myth is hard to die . 
  ~ ~ one day they might even figure out those people where even smarter than `` homo sapiens sapiens '' and just killed eacher others to genetic extinction level in stupid wars or something ~ ~ . 
  but i guess racism always was a human trait . 
  paris ' housing market is pretty much the same . 
  juncker definitely is n't perfect at pr :(, 
   and now , in defense of saddam , a genocidal authoritarian dictator who invaded pretty much all his neighbors , he wants to prosecute blair ? 
  what the hell are you smoking ? 
  he never supported saddam afaik . 
  so essentially you are saying `` if you do n't agree with what the bush & blair administration did you litterally are a saddam supporter !, 
  terrorist ! '', 
  can we stop with this insane `` you are with us or a terrorist '' logic ? 
   the same man who called hamas & hezbollah his friends ? 
  that was the ~ ~ torygraph ~ ~ telegraph twisting words out of context for cheap political recovery .
