if you can protect your declared borders , you can declare your house an independent state , worked for thousand of years and still working like that , just methods have changed a little . 
  have n't really watched media , no tv , and my main source of information is mostly guardian or whatever google news spills on android . 
  no threat ? 
  ukrainian extremist nationalists have been there even at times of soviet union . 
  when su have fallen , they have gained a lot of freedom . 
  by time of maidan , they like gestapo have already been well-trained and self-militarized organisation . 
  train packed with them have been stopped before crimea and turned back at this same time . 
  one parent german , other russia-ukrainian . 
  it have to be proven that referendum was staged first , otherwise you are under-digging peoples democratic choice . 
  should i remind you that crimea was an autonomy with their own elected president and constitution which ukrainian government disbanded without any regards ? 
  i would n't deny that these were most probably russian special forces , but you would they were here for protection of citizens from terror of nationalist groups ( whom government were using consistently by now ) and provokers . 
  you can clearly see what these same people have done with novorossiya and donetsk county . 
  are you really too thick to see that your government is straight up lying or do you feel that it 's you duty as a patriotic non-russian citizen to pretend that these lies make sense ? 
  i 'm not russian citizen , i 'm german from birth, 
  have russia officially annexed crimea ? 
  not really , referendum took place . 
  was it staged ? 
  dunno , but bureaucratic part was done , crimea was an autonomy with their own elected president for a reason . 
  you compared armed conflict in chechnya with extremist islamists and weaponless civil people in georgia ? 
  ukraine have sold lots of their weaponry , including some to georgia , then georgia have attacked peacemaking forces and minority civilians in abkhazia . 
  ( russians suddenly found us humvees there ) yeah , let 's arm some terrorists too , oh wait , usa already armed them !, 
  high-school is not exactly applicable for russian education system . 
  it 's either school ( 1-9th classes ) , then trade school ( least popular ) or 2 more years in school ( 10-11th classes ) and then university/institute . 
  there are sometimes specialized schools , math , physics , languages , music , arts , etc. 
  in case of languages , there are 2-3 languages program . 
  yeah , why are they showing their teeth while we are mustering armed forces on their borders ? 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315.html ), 
  probably because germany is member of said organisation and can veto new member ? 
  also not only german promised that , 
  annexation worsened effect for sure , but a lot of them have been here even in 1970 's , there were areas not safe for traveling for even ukrainians in ukraine ... 
  that is problem and many do n't realize that nationalism is an idea that is always in state between dormant and fully active in us . 
  it 's also kind of conterminous especially if * right words * are said ( both allies and nazies said these words ) . 
  every man is a nationalist on scale from 0 to 100 % , both 0 and 100 % are both bad , because they are extremes , and extremes in anything is not healthy . 
  downside is that reality is often distorted and not what it looks like , because it 's all built on trust . 
  how many of us have explicit trust to one another ? 
  good portion but not too much , yet it looks like we trust anything we hear explicitly as long as it 's inline with ** our ** reality . 
  yeah , ** promise ** , german foreign minister gave one to ussr about nato expansion , did n't hold for long , did it ? 
  devils are in details , android os is an open-sourced product that does not contain play store by default , because play store is product of google/alphabet and to include it , there 's an agreement with conditions . 
  using term `` android monopoly '' is not correct here as it 's `` play store monopoly on android os on mobile phones and tablets '' . 
  android os can run on anything with supported arm processor : tv 's , fridges , routers , majority of soc boards, 
  memorandum is not explicitly a treaty , it is similar to a treaty , but is often used when parties involved do not imply a legal commitment . 
  it does n't change whatever happened with ukraine as country , but this paper is practically useless legally , it 's just that ' a piece of paper ... 
  ukraine is not occupied by nazis , but there are more neo-nationalists there then it is healthy for any state, 
  it 's not a treaty though , and us said that it 's not legally binding =\\, 
  my first reaction to protests was :  oh , huh , why are they protesting results of legal democratic elections now ? 
  they had 4/8/240 years to change it if they did n't like the way it works . 
    and look at these leaving the country or burning us flag , how patriotic !, 
  what the hell , tree did n't kill her daughter , it was rapid deceleration of body with vehicle she was driving . 
  at fault here is either vehicle manufacturer for factory fault or she herself for neglecting vehicle servicing , definitely not tree unless it 's an ancient ent who decided to go for a walk . 
  maybe someone said they need to burn a flag to delete account and break an agreement betweeen facebook and a user, 
  this probably is the biggest issue here , we really need to filter out refugees from arrogant and help these who really need it , they really do n't need much to begin with , and anything above that is a bonus for them . 
  stopping support for refugees would be catastrophic for families , but supporting these who do n't know how to accept help and support makes them only worse , it fuels their arrogance just like letting kid behave anyway it want would make it only worse in future . 
  the arrogant of them do n't value anything , you ca n't even threaten them because there 's nothing you can do to them and they know it . 
  which is also part of problem too ... too much have been hidden too , some of things would have been best to be carefully exposed . 
  * i can not represent all germans understandably . 
  * personally i evaluate people by their actions , though every action then weights more than anything else for me . 
  i value honesty and calm wisdom . 
  i 've encountered refugees and * refugees * , first happened to be mostly female or old people , second - male young and male adults . 
  refugees ** are ** grateful for any support and help , they would smile and accept any support even if it 's minuscule . 
  * refugees * , they may throw your help in your face if they do n't like the colour or if it 's insignificantly by their standards . 
  it feels like they think that they are ** obligated ** for whatever they desire up to level of middle class in germany . 
  they are also loudly vocal , it 's normal to be vocal , but they are one-sided vocal , they do n't listen , just keep shouting ... 
  a lot of them have been taken , and a lot of people were willing to help them , but then a problem came up - their behavior clashed terribly with european culture and some of them have abused our help, 
  why not rent rooms to artists/writers ? 
  quite place , remote enough and services are available, 
  of course !, 
  they 'll just turn it 90deg clockwise !, 
  i would expect it to be libyan refugees, 
  well , buck , that 's part of problem i have n't thought about ... 
  corruption ? 
  was n't it sweden who hallucinated over `` russian '' sub in 2014 ? 
  huh , i though many have long time ago removed such limitations, 
  well , upside of this media propaganda is that maybe it will teach people to rely less on media , it 's still spewing a lot of garbage ... 
  which i personally fail to see why is explicitly bad , yes they can damage one candidate in favor of the other , but overall : government that is built on lies to it 's citizens is already questionable base for democracy ... 
  why is it called cyber-attack if voting mechanism is not attacked , not even close ? 
  even `` media-attack '' would better describe . 
  voting in germany is done via paper bulletins ... 
  i 'm not an employee , so i do n't really know that much of standard interview process , but i have a good perspective from inside and can say that employees are not eggheads , they are all definitely knowledgeable , they definitely put a lot into their study , but that 's not their only life or interests . 
  if you have real interest in field you 're studying and have a willpower to study more then uni program offers , i 'm sure you 'll have a good chance even for a position of a bit different area from your study . 
  even if you do n't have degree , but have knowledge and experience or involvment , you still have a fair chance, 
  depends on company and field , but from experience , siemens and google do hire uni students and recent grads and recent grads in germany . 
  not really , these countries do have universities , experienced workers might be a bit harder to get , but by investing a bit into both new workers ( even if they 're still studying ) and experienced workers , you can build great teams . 
  people are willing to study if there 's a good place for work, 
  can it be in eastern europe please ? 
  or far western europe . 
  it would help in tipping the economical balance in european union towards balance even if a little ... 
  nothing personal there , she received seat in terrible time for this position . 
  i 'm really really skeptical russian would annex any of listed regions . 
  barely any reason for , and if they wanted , they would 've done it right away in single swoop with crimea . 
  especially considering that apparently many of population from these regions do n't really want to be part of russia , but rather autonomy from governmental shit they are receiving ( in context of ukraine ), 
   kill everybody in local administration is it about crimea or other regions of ukraine ? 
  if crimea then , um , 0 people have been killed during crimea annexation . 
  also  supply rebel forces who kill everybody in local administration hey , exactly actions of some country from middle east !, 
  otherwise they would have to start their meeting with `` we have to address the elephant in this room '', 
  invite them to show themselves off , and if they are really dumb , they wo n't even notice, 
  well she is right here though , as i understand they do n't have to balance family and career as it 's being done for them by their husband !, 
  well , politics is just as religion for some , let them as long as they are not bothering anyone, 
  why not iceland ? 
  i remember iceland wanted some refugees,
