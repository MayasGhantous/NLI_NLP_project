  thanks , will be interesting to find out why this is happening, 
  care to share the example of such artist ? 
  there is no way to prevent it except for not selling it at all . 
  why is it a big news ? 
  they were produced since 1981 and sold to syria until 2003 . 
  same probably goes to tow , at least i hope . 
  same happened in latvia when they joined eu . 
  their sugar factory have been forced to closure because eu already have lots of sugar , which chain-forced all sugar beet farms to search for new crops to grow , many have n't found alternatives to sustain themselves . 
  obama , go home , you 're drunk, 
  unfortunately fellow west germans though it was a good move to buy manufacturers and production in ex-ddr and close it . 
  oops , no jobs in ex-ddr !, 
  let them go there and die , if survived , arrest on the way back, 
  baltic is big , which part of it ? 
  it also have a lot of international airspace . 
  well , no-one forces them to break this law . 
  unlike government in st.petersburg when they wanted bribes from ikea to let them open new store ... 
  eu is still closer to ussr than your comparison to germany . 
  we can find even better target for comparison , usa !, 
  single language , many states were joined non-willfully , washington d.c. also , being economically bullied or bribed into eu is still a bad way . 
  and i would say that we are run by some dictators from brussels . 
  you are being completely non-constructive right now ... `` most of the high ranking members came from russia '' it would be nice to see a better breakdown of this . 
  nikolay krestinsky - whiterussian , yuri andropov - don cossack family , part russian parn ukrainian ? , lavrentiy beria - georgian , nikolai podgorny - ukrainian , georgy malenkov - turk/macedonian/greek ? , joseph stalin - georgian , leonid brezhnev - ukrainian , mikhail gorbachev - russian-ukrainian , vladimir ivashko - ukrainian, 
  incorrect scale of comparison . 
  it 's more correct to compare eu and ussr , lots of cultures , lots of languages , lots of nations . 
  ( russian , belarusian , ukrainian , lithuanian , latvian , estonian , armenian , azeri , georgian , tajik , and many more , around 105 languages in total ), 
  many more are prevented and not disclosed for many years, 
  title is misleading . 
  she applied for social house for war veterans because she was a wife of one . 
  nothing to do with her separate status of prisoner of nazi concentration camps , there 's no social houses for this category as i 've been informed . 
  ukraine and georgia were part of ussr , and stalin was georgian , why not blame them too for atrocities of ussr ? 
  tax crimes are actually one of the most common actual crimes in russia . 
  and most of immigrants from ex-ussr are gray-employed and are not paying taxes . 
  / me jelly nice to see companies addressing accommodation issues , reminds me of siemensstadt in berlin, 
  i expect on opening ceremony at least dozen of dancers who are specialized on dancing with various poles, 
  any place geographically to south from munich or to north from oulu ? 
  whole chain should be checked . 
  was it hospital ? 
  was it still in use ? 
  i 've recently found [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thz94ha-vjq ) that also shows them , and it 's easier to see their scale , they are damn huge , not sure i 've ever seen anything like that , highest building i 've seen is berliner turm, 
  what does legitimacy have anything to do with violation of international law ? 
  * [ i 'm surprised no-one have mentioned this in this thread ] ( http://i60.tinypic.com/118ep8p.jpg ) *, 
  * citizens can be criminals *, 
  was n't libya 's opposition linked to al-qaeda though ? 
  and then supported in `` civil war '' ... 
  hm , [ i would trust un weapons inspectors and british military lab ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/is-assad-to-blame-for-the-chemical-weapons-attack-in-syria/a-38330217 ) more than hrw  an analysis of the chemical weapons used in ghouta , conducted by a british military lab , which found the gas to be of a different composition than the syrian army possessed . 
  the attack took place while un weapons inspectors were in the country, 
  not only that , gas attack that happened in 2013 took place while un weapons inspectors were in the country and british military lab have found the gas to be of a different composition than the syrian army possessed . 
  oops, 
  [ i 've seen it somewhere 14 years ago ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/powell-anthrax-vial.jpg ), 
  it 's usually done in standesamt , not sure why anyone would want to go to the other country to get married , unless they are gays, 
  though it does n't really show anything as we do n't know who and how many criticized it and how many have agreed . 
  if there 's a traffic jam , you move a bit to side , because in majority of cases such traffic jams are caused by accidents , and where accidents will be emergency vehicles, 
  but then , re ** pub ** lic of ireland turned out to be for better !, 
  even now i remember dublin and it 's trinity : beer factory whiskey factory trinity university and pubs all between xd, 
  new zealander colleague , though he lives with britisch passport , is starting process to get new zealand passport now and will be applying for permanent residency, 
  britain should have been re ** pub ** lic, 
  you make censorship look good ... 
  that was one of many reasons ussr have fallen , censorship of events, 
  does n't mater who you are , it 's dark , warm , brownish and smelly inside / s, 
  europe top problems ... 
  well , in germany [ it 's quite simple , you are required by law to have government health insurance if your gross salary is less than 57600 euros per year . 
  ] ( http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/healthinsurance.html ) as without insurance , hell , no idea , it 's always best to inquire with clinics directly about minimal costs and possible extended costs . 
  as for coverage , i unfortunately do n't know myself even though my insurance company have probably spent a good fortune on me : i 've been to hospital once with pierced lung ( externally , by itself ... ) , few days of various tests and complex scans , 1 week in virusology isolated room ( cleaned air circulation , double doors , toiled , bathroom ) , unfortunately i have no idea how much it cost as i 've never seen the bill ... my insurance just covered it all . 
  i 've also have gone through lots of tests including genetic research which takes them few months to do in lab , never seen the bill either =\\ p.s. 
  that all was in berlin charit\u00e9 university clinic, 
   alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited at the military training place . 
  i think that 's not compatible with being russian . 
  some people from berlin/brandenburg will fit requirements , but will they go there ... 
  this is a problem in many countries today =\\, 
  how kosovo scenario have not happened there yet ? 
  ehe-he , it became it 's own joke for few years already, 
  they have barely any structure though , it takes months to find anything there ... 
  how many of them are actually children ? 
  we once got our short classmate ( 17 year old ) impersonate as 12 year old to get one free pass into museum . 
  i 'm actually not getting at anything , honest , just remembered that part of europe history where just movement of troops to border started wars . 
  though in general it 's not that much different today , though movement of conventional weapons sparks diplomatic wars . 
  we 'd had fourth world war by now than , with sticks and stones, 
  before ww1 that would 've already meant start of war ... 
  if it only `` borders '' , what would something like `` riding paranoia-train '' look like ? 
  these estimations though ... 
  i can make similar from here !, 
  yeah , ca n't argue with that , `` whataboutism '' have it 's use , but only in very limited situations where it is actually relevant, 
  that 's where we are quite wrong , we should n't trust either unless they 've proven with time, 
  hm , why exactly loss of control over nation self-governance is not similar to what happened in crimea ? 
  their past 90s list ist quite sizable too now : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_involvement_in_regime_change#after_the_dissolution_of_the_ussr, 
  red as communism / s, 
  why does n't it allow russia to do shitty things ? 
  it certainly give them upper hand when we allowed unpunished precedents of similar actions, 
  no , but what we are doing is exactly the same , we 're allowing actions of us for hell know how many years now , and at same time condemn russia for similar cases, 
  1989 , panama , overthrown and installed pro-us government ? 
  not quite , but far worse in it 's own ways . 
   opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position hm , is n't the other name for it `` double standards '' ? 
  i vote for brown / s/s, 
  what are they protesting for/about/against ? 
  so far it only shows me that people are free to protest in russia ... 
  what exactly are we looking at ? 
  it is known fact from school geography class on how big russia is . 
  sure , i 'll just represent ~ 40 % than , 
  nato is a relic of cold war , it had only one purpose , really , oppose ussr and while ussr is no more , russia is not a threat on level that would require whole world opposition anymore , europe is capable on itself to deal with russia on diplomatic level , us is not helping with it at all here , only making it worse . 
  not really , multiple polls have shown that germany does n't support a lot of recent nato actions , a lot of these have been influenced by us too .
