  can us be removed from nato ? 
  no , so it 's easier to get out of nato than that . 
  so it 's not straight 60 % in favor nato any more . 
  if eu nations will start pausing or exiting their nato on the other hand , they ca n't veto that ... 
  ah well , in that case `` we '' stands for germany ** edit : ** it 's ~ 40 % of germany now . 
  `` we 'd '' stands for `` we would '' if this is what bother 's you , otherwise feel free to be more expressive :3, 
  in extra short version , ramstein is used to operate drones , if which are used to attack civilians , then these actions are unlawful and need to cease this function . 
  un charter ch .1 article 2.4 :  all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations . 
  which is part of german law under gg art 25, 
  we just need to legally bind political promises , otherwise they 'll never learn ** not to lie ** all the time, 
  that data might be also used for future trials over war crimes ... 
  nah sorry , ~ 40 % of us would rather have something new , not a relic from us led cold war . 
  unfortunately for example ramstein base is already under legal lookup due to possible breach of international law by activity that is done via or on this base . 
  oh nice , one step closer to eu lead defense !, 
  wow , you 've grasped half of what have written , care to grasp the other half ? 
  not changing , it was my context . 
  yeah , great comparison , us have 3 neighbors . 
  mexico 3 . 
  cuba so , canada is great as i know , mexico well , no idea , that 's probably their main drugs supplier ? 
  and cuba , oh yeah , they 've been greatest friends since nixon times !, 
  let 's not forget that germany is like it is today because ussr have gone all edgy and cold , and us suddenly needed a solid border country , and turns out you ca n't do that if you turn that country [ into an agricultural and light industry economy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_plans_for_german_industry_after_world_war_ii ) , oops . 
  great ally indeed . 
  panama was n't that lucky , right after they 've been invaded and new pro-us government have been installed and it 's been greatest businesses asset , well till some papers have shown up . 
  bitcoin price is not stable , there 's no guarantees it will not plummet and loose 99 % of it 's cost ... 
  yeah , we benefit greatly from terrorists and refugees from us * interventions * in middle-east , their pet projects have spread * peace and prosperity * whether they 've walked , and us allies in middle-east have also greatly contributed to region * peace * , so much actually that they even lead human rights council !, 
  thanks nixon/ford/carter / reagan/bush/clinton / bush/obama !, 
  * you sound like an expert in russian history and psychology *, 
  these westies have no idea how to build a proper wall / s, 
  you 're applying realities of 1950s to 2010 ~ , it 's common mistake that is easily oversight . 
  just as trying to comprehend realities of 1930-50 from today 's perspective , it 's futile unless you have a head clean from bias and have a really really good knowledge of local history , which absolute majority of people do n't have ... people from 1950s are not there , you ca n't have realities of that time today, 
  that 's an interesting and valid possible interpretation . 
  though last part have no connections whatsoever with today 's events , russia as nations is incapable of harming ukraine in the way holocaust was ... 
  i think they wanted to make a sacrifice to calm the aryan god , though they probably forgot that he favors gays , jews , gypsies and some other folk i forgot , not sheeps / s, 
  it 's looks like it 's still armed with at least it 's front turret it 's heavily armored , you 'll need to get army involved to shut it down if that guy would go rogue normally government does n't want anyone to have armoured and weaponize vehicle ... 
  us does n't have greatest history for a great ally either ... 
  russia is a federation of great many nations , cultures and languages . 
  it probably have more arab dialects than rest of the world combined ... 
  it depends on their birth year : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nationality_law#birth_in_germany, 
  they have n't met criteria to have it, 
  that 's exactly what i 'm talking about , even mentioning revocation of citizenship will result in outcry from practically everyone involved and not involved . 
  that 's why i 'm not even trying to theorize about it now , it 's really complex matter and requires a lot of research in multiple fields : law , history , history of law , precedents and probably more, 
  this specific instance is for these without citizenship . 
  these with german citizenship and without any other are completely outside of scope . 
  these with dual-citizenship might be reviewed . 
  in all cases with citizenship , it 's among the most touchy topics i can think of . 
  can anyone from bulgaria or anyone who is familiar with subject explain how one have : a ) purchased military vehicle which seems to have weapons and weapons systems intact b ) can operate it legally it 's literally an equivalent of a tank , flying one ... p.s. 
  this source does n't have any time-stamps , no idea how old is this news, 
  speaking german , but as soon as you support isis , you ca n't possibly live german life , it 's not compatible with each other , so isis is more important for you . 
  we just help you to reunite with your brothers . 
  though their scientists do look like hipsters : [ grigori perelman ] ( https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=165879581 ), 
  i still think that management of any company should be personally financially responsible for any company loss if it 's their fault . 
  also not bailing out banks next time they sink would be nice . 
  i though he was intelligence operative , not agent . 
  his identity have n't been hidden when he was working in germany . 
  edit : wow , they 've thrown all conspiracies and one-sided theories there , not sure what else i should 've expected from f/vox , us-russian reset for example was a disaster from the beginning, 
  bankers can go to frankfurt , startups to berlin or anywhere actually , except for munich ( too expensive ), 
  so , was there anything for breaking this specific law ? 
  or was it traded off for cooperation ? 
  or was it simply waved off ? 
  and nothing about comparing/calling germans nazis . 
  does n't every country have something like this though ? 
  a lot of people are quite detached when it comes to foreign customs and traditions, 
   entry of foreigners and stateless persons to the temporarily occupied territory and exit from it is allowed only with the special permission via entry-exit control points, 
  next step is to introduce `` virtual '' tickets to view it via streaming and then get all artists compete remotely , and now no one need to `` host '' this , so travel ban problem solved !, 
  but it 's a law , is n't it ? 
  and then they were taken not to gulags , but to imprisonment camps where they were treated better than majority of soviet population , partially it was required by geneva law about prisoners of war . 
  well that 's interesting , i though he was supposed to be jailed in ukraine by their law about visiting crimea not through ukraine, 
  actually concentration camps were these temples , they were places for sacrificing people in it 's name , it was also believed that jews , gypsies and gays were the most valued by aryan god, 
  as i heard z\u00fcrich have them in every 3 houses or something like that , which is required by law . 
  and triple ( ? ), 
  backedup water system too, 
  so declarations of war are so last century now , everyone just wage war ... international laws need a good reevaluation and update for sure, 
  and i though ww2 have been won by us / s, 
  you sound like typical us democrat / s, 
  it was a win-win decision from the beginning , no action or inaction would have been without a harm for ukraine at this point . 
  there 's some damage for russia for `` selecting '' this specific person , but it 's mild due to absence of facts that it was definitively a politically motivated decision ( i.e. 
  e-mail or script stating that ) . 
  no war have been declared though , everyone 's still waiting, 
  neat , though with current safety requirements this is not achievable =\\, 
  that 's ... that 's a terrible comparison there ... 
  at least they have n't tried to say that spiked rise of crimes committed by non-germans is a myth . 
  it 's unfortunately a solid statistics now =\\, 
  i 'm not sure russia cares that much about comparing spendings , because their military market is completely separate from nato military market , prices for each similar entry are just too different to compare in this way . 
  they will be doing it officially on 30th march though ( their church have recognized st. patrick this year ), 
  have n't russia had forts in california at some point ? 
  uhm , was n't it blocked from kiev side ? ... 
  darn , this is so nice . 
  people care about their surroundings, 
  and pastor makes double of that, 
  i 'm usually very restrained when it comes to emotions , but darn , whenever this song comes up , i 'm grinning like happy man without any worries ... 
  development costs money , money needs approval and technical plan . 
  but first things first , they do n't even know some people want to upgrade this part of web site or that something might not work . 
  so feel free to reach out with a constructive feedback !, 
  their e-mail is written on right side of the website . 
  is it a law which targets mostly specific group of people and will be applied to them only ? 
  there 's a legal term for that , but i ca n't recall how it was called ... 
  interesting , thanks for sharing !, 
  are we going to build a wall ? 
  no , they are part of europe and they are part of our problems , we have to deal with these problems too ... 
  yeah , someone have no idea in difference between tourism and living there ...
