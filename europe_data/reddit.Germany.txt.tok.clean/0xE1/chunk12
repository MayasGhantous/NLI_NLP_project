  it 's often said : do n't confuse tourism with immigration . 
  * no no , they are allies , they are allowed to do that *, 
  * top noise maker * p.s. 
  sorry , i listen only to instrumental and classical music =\\, 
  and nothing about the system of imperial units !, 
  i know people who do n't want wall back , but the 're saying that west germany was significantly better place before unification , after that apparently a lot of `` tension '' have been relieved and a lot of policies have gone slack or abandoned which resulted in degradation of social services in comparison . 
  there 's a subway ? 
  i 've been there and have n't seen it ... 
  if i remember correctly ntv is considered a terrible channel even by russians . 
  there have been a lot more of bad apples in journalism lately =\\, 
  neat , i thought right away about allowing them to comment anyway , but then put a flag on their comments for other to see . 
  but that would be not a right thing to do ... 
  not to mention that far from all germans have been involved in atrocities . 
  some even left germany before 1933, 
   better safe th ** e ** n sorry srsly ? 
  oh come on , i have n't watched it and now there 's a spoiler in title !, 
  enforcing darwin laws i see, 
  he 'll get a law that would actually punish politicians that have been found explicitly lying ? 
  it 's been going since beginning of widespread ability to transfer information in less then a day , it just dulled after fall of ussr and spiked in last few years, 
  call it act of terror , problem solved, 
   recruit a more diverse workforce that 's the american way to fix racism there ... 
  there should be equality everywhere , let 's diversify earth population , governments are racists to not introducing white people into their society !, 
  we need white people to breed more to equalize with the rest of the world !, 
  ah , got it now , this makes more sense xd, 
  one of roots of problem is that in europe governments were bound with church at some point , thankfully church and government are separated for long time now . 
  but some laws are still * tinted * with religious background . 
  as for expelling , it was practiced long time ago , but then , america have trump now because his ancestors were expelled from germany for breaking a law ... 
  it would 've been totally cool if it was religion only , believe whatever you want . 
  problem is if religion intertwined with laws or encourages unlawful behavior, 
  well , there is a caste system , it consists of two types of people 1 . have work 2 . does n't have work / s, 
  if one is being good a men , yea , whatever , what do you expect ? 
  praises ? 
  ** ha ** , no-one will praise you if you 're doing what is ** expected ** from you . 
  if you misbehave though ... 
  let 's move un headquarters to iceland !, 
  right between europe and us . 
  or libya , well ranged between all countries, 
  well , at least they 've done something with terrible libya 's regime which suppressed it moderate opposition . 
  now there 's peace and gay rights everywhere * ^ / s *, 
   if it criticizes certain other countries , they will just pull out of the un and  to be able to claim that it is a place , where everyone can speak with everyone do n't sum up , it 's organisation where everyone can speak , but they ca n't speak ... 
  which means that un is failing at it 's ** primary function **, 
  distorted and only placed here to mock other party . 
  it 's looks quite a bit off when compared to whole article . 
  like it was added there afterwards by third party . 
  something like this should n't be anywhere near journalism, 
  so we are not to do anything about fake or misleading news ? 
  or lying politicians ? 
  both have affect on population with heavy consequences . 
  article is valid , until you reach last 3 paragraphs ... 
  or we could just make any fake or misleading news be punishable , in limited way of course . 
  it should n't be only loss of trust for them, 
   berlin spied on foreign journalists good that i 've moved from berlin , so i 'm not part of it . 
  though my parents are apparently spying on journalists there , maybe should ask them if they found anything interesting, 
  thankfully we live in civilized society with laws which are enforced . 
  it 's far from as simple as you paint it . 
  if this property was n't gained at their time , you ca n't seize it . 
  especially if there are other people living there who had nothing to do with their crimes . 
  and anything of size of a castle is never owned by only one person . 
  it 's always sizable family usually of several generations . 
  looking at anything from modern point of view is biggest mistake one can do while studying history , it just does n't work . 
  you have to view it through knowledge and culture of that period of time and events in other countries . 
  and in comparison with russian empire , they were within level with all other nations worldwide for this time ... 
  if it was owned by family long before 1933 , why would n't they ? 
  not that you could easily escape nsdap while being well known family ... you either joined or fled , there was no middle ground =\\, 
  what ' about completely unsafe ghetto 's and questionable on tourist routes selling cheap chinese ^ ( no offence china , you can produce good stuff ) crap ? 
  paris * you mean, 
  nein , we 'll send them some people with compatible culture , they are dedicated workers !, 
  if i remember correctly , us news agencies are closely tied with us intelligence agencies . 
  so this precaution is quite valid from this perspective . 
  wow , we do n't need un painted russian peacekeepers there, 
  if i remember correctly , there is already a way for people to vote on municipal level , though i do n't remember through what procedure . 
  it was not that straight forward i think . 
  s-300 / 400 are unfortunately not the only capable aa system , they 're working on buk-m3 system , not much is confirmed about it yet , but they have [ estimated probability of hitting a target with one missile for aircraft ** 0.95 ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buk_missile_system#buk-m3 ) . 
  and according to [ this source ] ( http://army-news.ru/2015/06/buk-m3-vyvedet-armejskuyu-pvo-na-novyj-uroven/ ) , they have 72 rockets per unit . 
  ( though would n't trust it with any other numbers written there , they claim 0.99 probability ) unfortunately i do n't know how nato views their chances , they are not very public about that , and i do hope they are not overconfident . 
  at least some of their reports that i 've read were sober about nato vs russia capabilities . 
   disclosed range of 400 km carriers have best and highest radars in any fleet , and problem with radars is that for cruise missiles that travel within 10m from surface , radar need direct visibility for detection . 
  these 400km are great for anything that flies higher than 50m =\\ aircrafts going to anywhere near russian air-defense ? 
  that 's suicide ... 
  for that we would have to boost a lot of areas that have either gone dormant or been completely erased by now ... that might be far less achievable then eu coordinated defense =\\, 
  might be a joke for you , not for germany though ... 
  i 've had one 500 error page . 
  i 've saved it , will print and drop it by google office in munich tomorrow morning xd edit : i also found that fonts were missing when saved via `` save as ... '' in chrome , and what you 'd think , [ they have n't implemented that part yet !, 
  ] ( https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/content/renderer/savable_resources.cc#159 ), 
   learn about the radar involved i confess that was the only part that i 've looked at here , and result was that carriers have radar detection range of up to 40km , and this gives them maximum of 20 seconds to counter said missile , that is if it 's detected on edge of radar detection range . 
  you certainly could have made a better answer than that . 
  okay , let 's cut it to zircon missile with max range of 400km , which unfortunately for any target is hypersonic with speed of m6 . 
  m6 is about 2km per second , faster than blackbird , and they are already arming with them right now ... 
  one can build few dozens of ships with more capabilities then single not even super carrier . 
  do i need to repeat how easy it will be for russia to sink something as big as carrier ? 
  they can do it from their borders today . 
  what i implied originally that anyone outside of spain just ca n't recognize new state in this case with so many similarities with crimea . 
  anyone who would recognize of catalonia as independent state would put itself at international political jeopardy right away, 
  what about multi-state nato-led 7 months long military intervention in libya in 2011 ? 
  at least we 've not got involved in iraq war, 
  nope , crimea had 3 referendums , in [ 1991 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991 ) , [ 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 ) and [ 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014 ) . 
  problem with current way it is is that nato have been used by it 's members as a way to attack other sovereign nations with little to no proof , though u.n. is to blame there too ... 
  it looks like `` we 're totally screwed '' scenario ... 
  so you find current version of nato acceptable ? 
  how exactly is defense of europe related to non-europe ?
