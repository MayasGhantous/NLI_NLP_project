  we have u.n. for that . 
  peacekeeping and interventionism are important , though so far we have forced regime changes often bundled with that . 
  worked very well in libya , intervening in government attempts to fight terrorists ... 
  so you want to take `` policing the world '' mantle now ? 
  you do n't need any of that to get to middle east , you can even take a train . 
  the only places we may need any of that are saudi arabia or emirates, 
  looks more like a joke or sarcasm unfortunately ... 
  like you need a supercarrier for defense ... 
  especially considering it 's full uselessness against anything like russia 's anti-ship/sub kalibr cruise missile with rang up to 2500km . 
  what us provides in means of defense weapons and systems that can not be imported from us anyway ? 
  i 'd rather have more power in brussels than on some other continent . 
  exactly my thoughts on that , even 2 years should 've been enough at max ... 
  i would rather go with european defense forces ... 
  even with what happened after of crimea 's 3rd referendum ? 
  now would be worst possible time for this, 
  i have absolutely no problem with rants like this , the opposite actually , it expands our view on views of others from local perspective . 
  and i have absolutely nothing against people of us , all punches are directed only at these detached from people ... 
  i though it was electorate who have elected trump , not voters . 
  people still trust in `` democratic '' party ? ... 
  aaand ca n't miss a punch here , us is lower on democratic scoreboard than uk !, 
  there 's a village of one street and one house , not far from freiburg , and they are making huge and incredible cakes, 
  desperate for non-essential scheit ? 
  what 's next ? 
  desperate for tobacco and replacing it with cow-processed substitute ? 
  this is exactly why it 's fake news , it 's misleading and blowing things completely out of proportion . 
  fake news is part where : idiots drinking lotion ( which can not be described as booze ) have been presented as people who have been drinking valid alcohol ( citation from article ) :  mass alcohol poisoning they 've doing exactly what russia have been doing , taking one news , changing wording a bit here and there , and presenting it in a light they find favorable for their goal . 
  other ukrainian from this thread / u/trotsky _ and_icepick said they ca n't travel to get new one, 
   puts you into condition when crossing to place where you can get a new one is impossible how have it happened though ? 
  have they been banned from traveling ? 
  from my comment from this same thread ...  and you 're wrong , there are two similar products with similar name . 
   whitethorn infusion  whitethorn lotion, 
  it literally says on it `` ethanol , dangerous if digested '' ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acymzhdezik http://www.rferl.org/a/siberia-russia-lotion-deaths-alcohol/28186340.html http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-russia-alcohol-poisoning-20161219-story.html they 've been drinking bath lotion , not an infusion that is sold in vending machine you 've mentioned and apothecary edit : i 've also found a closeup shot shit ocr finally recognized : http://moment-istini.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/506263_59_1482148420_20161219_183549122.png and it says : ethanol !, 
  dangerous ( to ? ), 
  take inside, 
  and you 're wrong , there are two similar products with similar name . 
  1 . whitethorn infusion 2 . whitethorn lotion they 've probably expected the first , which is for drinking , but have not read label or have not clarified and bought the second one , which is not drinkable . 
  and even if they bough the first one , intended dosage is 20-30 drops per day . 
  it 's lotion , not drinkable to begin with , i would expect darwin would say something like `` their own darn fault '' . 
  alcoholism is a problem here , and this incident have not got it addressed in any way ... 
  hm from [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circassia#history ) they were converting : 1333 -- in his letter , pope john xxii ( to the king zichia ( circassia ) verzacht [ '' \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0430 '' in cyrillic script ] ) , the rome ( avignon ) pontiff thanks the governor of circassians for his assistance in implementing the christian faith among the adygs ( circassians ) . 
  verzacht 's power and status was so high that his example was followed by the rest of the circassian princes : they took the roman catholic faith . 
  if i remember correctly , they are not recolored , [ source ] ( http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/prok/ ) :  glass negatives : 1,902 b & w triple-frame images made with color separation filters  sepia-tone prints : 705 photos for which no glass negatives exist ( reproduced from prokudin-gorskii 's albums )  album pages showing all 2,433 sepia-tone prints and captions  modern color composites : 1,902 digital images made from the glass negatives in 2004  modern color renderings : 122 digital files made from the glass negatives in 2000-2001 . 
  [ terrible times apparently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide_of_indigenous_peoples ) , still a long way to get all of these atrocities recognized . 
  if i found correctly , a lot of circassians were christians , so it would n't have been about religion . 
  what the hell were they really doing it for and thinking =\\, 
  why ignore ? 
  i could have acknowledged it ? 
  exercises , it 's still their territory , not like anyone right have been affected by their exercises . 
  propaganda , world is under constant propaganda from multiple sources for last 70 years , and yet it 's only now when it 's wielded bluntly against us we start questioning it ? 
  `` hacking our parliaments '' , still being done by cia and other organisations for as long as internet exists , yet we question it only now ? 
  have you already forgot about our government communications being targeted by us ? 
  they 've been listening chancellors phone if i 'm not mistaken . 
  you 're hypocrite and supporter of double sided standards . 
  we 're either applying same standards to everyone equally not use them at all . 
   financing all extremist parties throughout europe wooow , slow down here , are we talking about political parties ? 
  because if you 're going into comparisons , then do compare it with middle east and result of us and saudi financing not just extremists , but real terrorist organisations whose actions are not comparable at all . 
  we ca n't just blindly go into war without solid proof of our claims , like we did in iraq and syria , this is worse than any warmorgering , ** it 's a crime ** . 
  and we are still missing majority of proof of claims you 've listed here . 
  looking at photos i can see now why barely anyone cares about race diversity there , it 's been here for hundreds of years ... 
  de fuq , it was no booze , these idiots have been lotion . 
  lotion is applied to face , not mouth . 
  oh wow , it 's actually falls under ** fake news **, 
  nothing other western nations have n't been doing ... 
  regime change is unfortunately not terribly different from border extension . 
  pros of regime change : * less or no publicity * up to fully controlled puppet state without anyone knowing * up to full control of economy of affected state without anyone knowing cons of occupation : * will trigger war with civilian population * may trigger defense acts with other countries * depending in disposition of other states , will be wielded against occupant, 
  hm , so with crimea , was it a military occupation ? 
  not really , foreign supported status referendum ? 
  yes , and it was easy for them to do so , they 've already voted for this multiple times in their history . 
  ( 1991 - 94 % , 1994 - 78 % ) what are others ? 
  russia had only one territorial change since soviet union . 
  but then , border expansions draws soooo much attention , russia totally should have just supplied moderate opposition with training and equipment and help them with regime change or independence or succession . 
  just like nato/us have done so many times it 's easy to lose count , there 's less publicity here in western media for some reason when this is happening . 
  your query is so narrow as if you 're trying to single out only specific candidate , try `` list of military operations '' or `` list of military occupations '' , or maybe `` list of regime changes '', 
  unfortunately we would also have to get rid of similar warmonging elements in europe and us to get desired peace, 
  as in `` free to screw yourself '' ... 
  expect more bullshittery from top , okay, 
  huh , that means that due to state succession they are stateless and second-class citizen . 
  also would n't it be against european convention on nationality ? 
  latvia have signed it, 
  well , cthulhu is not supposed to make any sense , he 's unfathomable after all, 
  more like foreign = underpriced to kill anything local, 
  now i want this linolada of yours =\\, 
  that would be japanese emoticon - cat face, 
  if they are not citizens , it means they have some other citizenship . 
  why do n't you just deport them ? 
  11.9 was n't supported by us either , but hey , us supported these guys before against commies !, 
  and only new years day was on sunday , all other holidays are on work days :3, 
  ow , companies fellowship of assholeship confirmed ... 
  but , it will run on green gas collected from bioreactors !, 
  * ah , gas projects . 
  there were several developments with siemens some time ago . . * oh wait , never-mind , they 're not going to be used anymore, 
   the most active members of the ukrainian team were actually from russia , or from breakaway russian-speaking regions of ukraine so , do they actually have information who they actually are by birthplace , ancestry and nationality ? 
  there are several million ukrainians in russia ... 
  that country have a vast enslavement history ... 
  please keep your `` german '' for yourself , we 're fine as it is, 
  does this analyse include libya 's gold and silver ? 
  if it 's a genuine mistake , i feel sorry for that guy , it can have bad and long lasting mark on ones life, 
  they are already going to make coins with him xd https://www.mdm.de/silbermuenze-deutschland-2017-steinmeier, 
  it really is , and one would have to read description to figure out if it 's current version or deprecated one ...
