  erm , what proof have eu supplied exactly to justify intervention in libya ? 
  wait , what about iraq then ? 
  was it self-defense after 11.9 too ? 
  yeah , should 've taken trumps example xd, 
  any `` sphere of influence '' is threat to international order , if only there was constant order though . 
  i think definition of international order of quite fluid under influence =\\, 
  yeah , no . 
  we should fix current taxation system . 
  because robots do n't pay income tax like employees do ? 
  it 's free market , they can outsource it wherether they want as long as it 's legally imported and taxed . 
  they wo n't receive any subsidies or tax breaks of course , 
  why not ? 
  it 's a good ground for tax for robot produced goods . 
  quick , ping their web sites !, 
  ** that ** , not a fucking single website have done it . 
  practically not a single site have followed that law in way it was intended . 
  i 've chosen wrong field , should 've gone `` expert '' , they seem to be on rise these days and there 's no responsibilities !, 
  there 's quite a lot of bs in that article ... 
  so they 'll put all eu workers to 12 month contracts ... 
   but also the real refugees this should be never forgotten and mentioned more often, 
  they are never happy unless it suits their business, 
  well , it 's one of the symbols of switzerland , and neighbor citizens have a say in applicants for citizenship . 
  i personally find it good , if new your new neighbor is asshole or does n't respect your culture , so why give them citizenship if they do n't fit ? 
  it 's new irish sideway island . 
  just turn your had to left until it 's horizontal and you 'll see it too !, 
  finally !, 
  someone have specifically written what exactly is not right !, 
  still so little details , where was it intercepted ? 
  under which angle were they approaching border of any state ? 
  it 's of course personal preference , but i certainly wo n't miss most of copyrighted music from last 50 years . 
  philipp glass , gorillaz and simon & gerfunkel are the only ones i can think of right now, 
  okay , turns out i 've been out of loop on ukrainian legislation news . 
  new language law have actually been passed and russian language is now regional language in some regions for minorities . 
  ban on russian books and movies have been a bit exaggerated , only propaganda books is subject for this ban . 
  movies can be treated as any sanctions , they can do whatever they want here . 
  the only reason i see now for russia to annex crimea is military base . 
  i ca n't find any confirmations about nationalists movements that were reported between euromaidan and annexation . 
  even though comparing such things is not valid : usa have wide history of recent atrocities and international crimes committed world wide apparently * in name of peace * does it not make it menace though ? 
  interesting , why exactly one citizen have more rights than the other ? 
  is it written in law ? 
  wrong , the way even russian language is treated , it can be seen that they were not out of danger . 
  ** update : ** i 've been wrong about language, 
   but, 
  africa is a single state now ? 
  surprise , i do n't read anything but bbc and guardian . 
  um , how is voentorg related to russian military except for selling civilian accessible military clothing and related accessories ? 
  anyone can come in , buy stuff and go anywhere with it ? 
  you can buy similar stuff all across europe too , uk have stores like that . 
  ( p.s. 
  i 've been interested in strikeball equipment , and clothing with accessories are really easy to find for any world army ), 
  and yet us and eu intelligence communities have failed to produce a report with solid evidence of any of that weapons . 
  other than photo 's which we know very well from un iraq resolution are not reliable . 
  general kolchak have in essence defected while doing so . 
   while the official policy of the russian federation early after the outbreak of the widespread armed conflict in 1992 was one of neutrality , many soldiers and officers of the 14th army were sympathetic to the pmr cause and had defected to the pmr and actively participated in the fighting as part of its armed forces , the republican guards . 
  furthermore , a considerable amount of the army 's materiel was taken without resistance or given to the pmr armed forces . 
   the commanding officer of the army , general g. i. yakovlev , was openly supportive of the newly created pmr . 
  he participated in the founding of the pmr , served in the pmr supreme soviet and accepted the position as the first chairman of the pmr department of defense on 3 december 1991 , causing the commander-in-chief of the cis armed forces , yevgeny shaposhnikov , to relieve him of his rank and service in the russian military . 
  yes , but it also is a bit to widely worded in many places . 
  for example if you 're a german citizen with non-german parent or grandparent , you can be subjected to integration courses , which might be used unreasonably very easily ... 
  peacekeepers there are joined forces of georgia , russia and ossetia ... 
  i do n't see any reason to have something like this for euro . 
  probably because it 's already 4 letters , it will be like writing 2017 as 2k17 , you can of course , but why ? 
   continue with fueling weapons there yet us and european intelligence community have failed to provide any evidence , i wonder why ? ... 
  ( something like numbers of russian troops on russian territory as can be seen on page 13 and 14 in `` russia 's war against ukraine - presentation october.pdf '' from dr. phillip karber ( dcleaks ) )  in 90s , russian troops attacked militaries of moldova and georgia in order to create their dead-end states . 
  you mean this ? 
   the transnistria war was a limited conflict that broke out in november 1990 at dub\u0103sari ( russian : \u0414\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441\u00e1\u0440\u044b , dubossary ) between pro-transnistria forces , including the transnistrian republican guard , militia and cossack units , and supported by ** elements of the russian 14th army ** , and pro-moldovan forces , including moldovan troops and police . 
  *  war didnt happen in abnkazia , but in ossetia . 
  same sour fruit, 
  facepalm , she is speaking about full eu integration whet it was vetoed by dutch ? 
  i 've been to norilsk twice , old buildings yeah , they were not designed well for long-term permafrost , newer ones ? 
  they will probably will stay fine for next 30 years without any maintenance as long as their windows are sealed . 
  ukraine ? 
  now mostly nothing ? 
  or maybe stop georgia ? 
  nothing , it was about abkhazia independence and prevention of wurther conflict escalation between georgia and abkhazia , where peacekeepers troops have been station for very long time . 
  which were attacked and killed by georgia troops . 
  finland - not sure . 
  distance from border to second major city of country in upcoming conflicts ? 
  what ' with 1990 ? 
  except that government will most probably have barely any support from population in this case , minority protection wo n't work because they are not endangered now . 
  and they ca n't even endanger that minority now after joining eu . 
  historical excuse is non existent with baltic states ... 
  saint petersburg have around 6 permanently stationed ice breakers and can rent more if need would be there . 
  also some rare years ice have max thickness of 30cm , which can be navigated by many ships without ice breakers support . 
  russia have ice breakers and they are not scared to use them . 
  well , you certainly answered my question here :  some small nations that are of little worth, 
  is it soviet or russian munitions ? 
  sounds like an invasion now . 
  i hope their vehicles have gone though t\u00dcv first xd, 
  wow , and i ca n't even get new passport without fingerprints . 
   russia wants us why exactly it wants any of baltic states ? 
  them again , less than years ago they had proposed one such `` great '' new law : https://integrationsgesetz.bayern/ though this one does n't look as bad , need to see actual text first though , never trust reporter ... 
   two years later , in october 1959 , he scored an even bigger success , assassinating the top leader of the ukrainian resistance hiding in munich , stepan bandera i wonder why this nazi have not been tried and executed by that time, 
  it was annexed , but your statement is also false . 
  they have not accepted new government , which means they have revolted ... 
  comma in middle gives your sentence complete different meaning , something akin to : i 've performed action of thinking , and then she died . 
  `` they '' who ? 
  the only people who would use this historically ancient therm are xenophobes and nationalists . 
  i 'm relieved here because it most certainly in no way represents the view from russians : 1 .
