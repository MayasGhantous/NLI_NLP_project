  also current phones/laptops already have problems with bad cpu/gpu soldering , nexus 5x phones are example of that , going into infinite bootloop . 
  us repair services are currently battling to keep their access to electronics schematics , there 's electronics repairman ( mostly apple ) with youtube channel : https://www.youtube.com/user/rossmanngroup/videos and he have video specifically about rights to repair : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_icjdhbrgg, 
  if i 'm not mistaken russian defense ministry have plans for practically any scenario at it 's borders , regardless ally or not , something like homework for them or something , planning every possible scenario ahead and archive for times when can be possibly needed . 
  offroad beasts , also looks like in good condition , though it would 've been more * used *, 
  from design in documentary i 've seen , they have ... weird fail-safe design , very weird ... 
  do n't forget gas street lamps in berlin !, 
  nice :3, 
  this news is clear sign that uk is abusive in this relationship . 
  do n't try making photo of it , just buy a postcard, 
  well yeah , provide support , deliver back to port of departure, 
  bus companies are a bit shady , surprised it have ended up this badly ... 
  interesting that even though it was founded in 1780 , from above it looks like roman fortress, 
  that happens when you do n't read e-mails , or agenda or calendar events ) ), 
  the thing is , uk is limiting eu progress in multiple areas , so it 's a positive change ... 
  emperor macron the terrible !, 
  he 's not targeting at that position himself, 
  +1 for open-source software example , 
  hitler was human being , all humans are hitlers in disguise !, 
  or lizards , but then , lizards are dinosaurs , as are chickens , so everyone are either hitlers or chickens !, 
  ^ oops , ^ that ^ escalated ^ quickly ^ to ^ godwin 's ^ law, 
  yeah , one can get precisely what 's hidden there with a small bit of work ... 
  even signature is easy to guess . 
   claim to be financed by the german federal government srsly ? 
  that 's exactly what i thought , only your message revealed to me that some people thought otherwise ... 
  france would have to build an empire to fulfill requirements for emperor position, 
  goblet of fire then, 
  i know right ? 
  and it 's especially wonderful after hot day , when temperature drops and there 's this unique smell of fresh rain which is especially strong, 
  what 's on the table ? 
  looks like urn with last president pr something like that ... 
  oh , okay , so it 's probably like bundestag ( federal diet ) in berlin and the one i linked is probably something like bundesrat ( federal council ), 
  i was told this is [ russian parlament ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%93%d0%be%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%8f_%d0%b4%d1%83%d0%bc%d0%b0#/media/file:building_of_council_of_labor_and_defense,_moscow.jpg ) building,

  that hunk is 32-22 years old , and it 's still afloat and operational to degree, 
  she does n't have a tie though, 
  oh , that explains it pretty much , thanks, 
  either it 's bs or google have already done something , because it 's first in results when you search for `` encrypted email service '', 
  this is bad , county have to move away from it , not endorse it . 
  china is still underdeveloped today , they ca n't develop and produce military grade jet engine ... 
  no no , that 's the other german video, 
  that 's of course if it 's not their internal corruption fueled war between themselves ... 
  do hope this will make our state politicians review their * political * decision to switch back to windows, 
  it 's hard to miss hitler , he 's quite a * prominent * figure , one would have to be dead not to notice him . 
  / s when i google `` prominent historical figures '' , google shows me `` celebrities '' section starting with abraham lincoln , barack obama , john f. kennedy , donald trump wikipedia also have a [ list of prominent figures on the topic of nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_figures_in_nationalism ) are they all terrible people ? 
  source does n't seem to show whether they take pride in these people or not , though i confess maybe translation is not exactly accurate , but multiple translations of key word '' \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f '' does n't seem to imply that explicitly, 
  * queen / s, 
  at least they would n't have to wear them on their cloth unobstructed , right ? 
  yeah , they would have to fight it outside of icj and un, 
  that is for sure , islands would have to fight for it themselves, 
  that 's very outdated logo they found somewhere , could n't they you know , google google in google images ? 
  vatican secret service doing their job well, 
  nice, 
  damn terrifying . 
  though at first that someone is using term `` electrocuted '' incorrectly again , i was wrong this time ... 
   mauritius , which gained independence from britain in 1968 , argues that the uk broke international law when it separated off the islands before granting mauritius its independence . 
   families were forced to leave the chagos islands in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for a us air force base on diego garcia , which is leased until 2036 . 
  if that 's the case , they probably would have to return the profit from air base lease and sizable compensation for the rest ... 
  i personally see it valid for countries not involved in any way to abstain, 
  true then , i see that majority of political news and eu news are about germany and france ( aside from brexit ), 
  how are they over-represented ? 
  news coverage ? 
  germany , france and uk are on top of list by population , 15.97 % , 13.06 % and 12.74 % p.s. 
  just realized they all start with m , should we call them the tripple m team ? 
  diseased trees very often grow in parlaments, 
  * one does not simply fly over baltic sea *, 
  yet to see this article on this reddit : [ russian defense minister 's plane buzzed by nato jet over baltic ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-nato-intercept-iduskbn19c12y ), 
  at least she can still recall transfer of profit from rent of their own land from parlament , that 's about 200m pounds per year ( was before brexit at least ), 
  * subtle *, 
  what an interesting source you have , it have a nice twist to it , i have better one about exactly same cut off : [ russia cuts gas to ukraine while maintaining flow to eu ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20140705074400/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-16/ukraine-faces-russian-gas-cutoff-as-payment-talks-fail.html ) suddenly it 's 180 % from what you 've linked about supply to europe . 
  for reference on the core of issue :  on 16 june 2014 gazprom stated that ukraine 's debt to the company was $ 4.5 billion . 
   after intermediary ( that had started in may 2014 ) trilateral talks between eu energy commissioner g\u00fcnther oettinger , ukraine and russia failed on 15 june 2014 the latter halted ( after a deadline of 10 a.m. moscow time passed without it receiving payment ) its natural gas supplies to ukraine the next day . 
  weak article  as the world 's second-largest producer of natural gas , russia actually has leverage over its european customers by threatening to cut off gas supplies and had it for how long , 60 years ? 
  have it used it ? 
  unfortunately for russia , their gas supply is like nuclear weapon , you ca n't use it without irreversibly hurting yourself . 
  who will trust you if you will break your contract of such magnitude ? 
  you will win nothing , and loose pretty much everything on international market , wto alone would eat you . 
  it does look like he may have searched for video on youtube and got one linked in first comment, 
  quite an embarrassing confusion, 
  well it 's certainly odd , deserves a bit of suspicious , but there 's nothing ** hilarious ** there ... 
  sure ? 
   police ruled out foul play in all 14 of the cases, 
  why is it hilarious ? 
   but they move a lot to the right ist ' t it left ? 
  though in truth i have no idea what 's die-linke 's agenda today , i only know what communist party was before 1928, 
   according to buzzfeed . 
  sorry pal , but this falls under  disallowed submissions \u00a7 unreliable , propagandistic , and/or agenda-driven sources . 
  i pity the relatives of this old crazy man, 
  i do n't drink , and i do n't want to give anyone lashes even if they 'll enjoy it, 
  and russian political system calls itself democratic , 
   `` americans want their prisoners punished first and rehabilitated second . '' from what i 've heard , first clause is revenue , second is punish and there 's no third . 
  you 're missing the point that they are pushing their own agenda completely ignoring germany in that regard, 
  30c in munich on thursday , in south-facing room , with workstation ... 
  do n't give them ideas !, 
  ukraine is playing it 's own geopolitics , as does poland , you ca n't play one game , and not play others, 
  it still leaves him good reason to veto it , because it harms us relationship with germany , heavily this time, 
   7.2 gigabytes of mobile data every month . 
  wow , i ca n't even consume 700megs for my tariff, 
  there were still a lot of things that could have been avoided , east had agriculture on good level , which was annihilated , and not by fair competition =\\, 
  he have a good reasons to believe this , britain and us are well known for economical warfare , not to mention old as humans [ scapegoats ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnjq6blvyhm ) curse,
