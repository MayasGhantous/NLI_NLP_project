  i moved from berlin from block wehre there was no noise 24/7 to here in munich and i want a machine gun ... , i would of course install * useless * silencer and use it only on work days between 7-12 and 16-22, 
  unfortunately people from middle east make a lot of noise all the time , there are two middle eastern families in my 8 flat house , and they are really noise from around 14 till 22 , they very often use stairs as place to meet and talk , and for kids stairwell is a playground . 
  no , it was a field from look of it . 
  it 's common in germany to have fields bordering with cities in such a way, 
   mr. kasparov has launched the free russia forum , a gathering of activists and intellectuals who try to hash out ideas that may someday turn into policies i do hope at least 30 % of them have degree politologie or law , otherwise these policies would turn out to be so flexible in interpretation that it wo n't be better than current regime . 
  considering that majority of ingredients are coming from third world countries , said countries either raised salaries of farmers , or these between wanted bigger cut , or they switched to non-abusive chain where farmers are treated fairly ( that is if they have n't had it before ) . 
  not a big surprise, 
  david gauke is putins agent , he 's trying to divide europe, 
  care to show your sources ? 
  i think it 's quite a valid interest to put out a fuse on powder-keg at your belly . 
  please do show us how many tatars and ukrainians have been killed in crimea in 2014, 
  they 've got crimea without killing a single person after all, 
  [ told you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4lm2l2/uk_to_send_1000_troops_to_baltics_media/d3og9kh/?context=3 ), 
  pay with what precisely ? ... 
  can confirm , my new zealander colleague have poor communication skills ... 
  *** straight ***, 
  * and treasury can house country gold stock from iraq and syria * , which does n't make it good idea, 
  i totally agree about nuclear energy , especially considering there are ways to reuse `` nuclear waste '' from current nuclear plants for different types of nuclear power plants , unfortunately researches in this field do n't really receive funding in germany . 
  what 's russia apologism though ? 
  having active military does n't benefit country in financial manner either , but it 's a necessity for country stability in current world . 
  problem is that you ca n't close the valve in the meantime , otherwise factories would stop or you would have to cut gas to houses who use it for heating and hot water . 
  nuking allies in europe is acceptable ? 
  germany is furthest west target , which would leave even spain polluted with nuclear fallout even from single bomb . 
  many do n't , yet are still target for countries with nuclear weaponry . 
  at least russia have told them that they could be , usually it 's not really disclosed , i 've been thrilled to [ learn our ally would nuke good porion of germany in case of global conflict ] ( http://futureoflife.org/background/us-nuclear-targets/ ), 
  yes , but i would still say : politics , and only that, 
  because they 've crossed the road ? 
  they both are aggressors ... 
  is n't it normal in countries with nuclear weapons ? 
  some parts of western germany were targets for us nuclear weapons for quite some time too, 
  as `` refugees '' even though some of them are openly warranted by russia as terrorists . 
  unsurprisingly they 've committed several terrorist acts by now ... 
  it should be `` non-european companies should not be able to have more then 49 % of share over manufacturing companies in europe '' rather than '' < any specific country here  '', 
  more like used to build the bed itself, 
  only [ found ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch%c3%a2teau_miranda ) wiki article, 
  even if it will go unused now , it 's better to have something for future . 
  you never know who will come up to your doorstep . 
  supply with weapons of any country with serious human rights problem or civil war should be banned completely ... any country breaking this rule should be treated as north korea . 
  not like putin can make a facepalm motion once in a while, 
  unity against isis and then nothing done to saudi-arabia to stop their support of said isis , yeah , way to lead a movement, 
  it 's as much related as us in title ? 
  you mean us residence permits ? 
  apparently it was putin 's plan to lure ukrainians to russia : [ `` about 2.5 million ukrainian nationals , including 1.193 million men of conscription age , are staying in the territory of russia '' ] ( http://tass.com/russia/775024 ), 
  news agencies are as accountable as politicians nowdays ... 
  yeah , and news agencies surely do n't , yeeap, 
  unfortunately petition is on change dot orgy rather than https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/, 
  probably these who do n't have nuclear weapons or would survive initially . 
  reminds me of `` on the beach '' movie, 
  what about affects of lack of light on morning when going to work in winter time ? 
  in northern countries lack of light in wintertime is a big countrywide psychological problem . 
  i personally would love if time would be changed 4 times a year to smoother transition between winter and summer ... 
  why no daylight saving time ? 
  if it 's cheaper , totally worth it ? 
  for me it 's actually the other way around , as it 's looks more like some one have dedicated more time into this than anyone else , so it 's probably worth more, 
  well , if saudi arabia can reside in un human rights council ... 
  there 's a public toilet as i remember [ here ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/48\u00b023'52.3 `` n +9 \u00b0 59 ' 24.5 `` e/@48.397858,9.9895848,188m ), 
   not lost on twitter users is the rainbow flag flying over the barricade , which is an implication that the european union 's continuing financial woes are tied to their support for lgbt rights . 
  that 's a really wild guess ... 
  it could be there for no obvious reason what so ever, 
  that would be cool . 
  equip different part of ship with crew of different languages , babylon carrier !, 
   sarko not only him , but also un and nato for accepting fake evidence , again, 
  ca n't even find right words for something like this , calling them with any of reproduction organs would be an insult to said reproduction organ, 
  not sure it would have any significant effect , i 've been 47 ~ kg for about 10 last years , eating cakes and drinking tee with lots of sugar nearly every day . 
  + other sugar drinks and other occasional sweets, 
  why was n't it in place to begin with ? 
  surely people educated in economics would have foreseen such problem ? 
  or decided to purposefully ignore ? 
  clean it from anything but definition of location, 
  what if reason for aggression from russian pilot would be protection of assad forces ? 
  shooting down russian jet in this case could trigger obliteration of any non-assad-allied air forces in area with russian aa systems, 
   the anti-monopoly service characterized the russian economy as `` capitalism of state monopolies , '' which means there is no genuine competition . 
  at least according to [ this report ] ( http://www.resourcegovernance.org/resource-governance-index/report/state-owned-companies ) : russia is only fifth country in ranking of state-owned companies , norway have first place . 
  also  russia rosneft ** partially state-owned ( 50 % ) ** hydrocarbons  saudi arabia aramco ** state-owned ** hydrocarbons though unfortunately there 's no date there , it might be from year 2010 . 
  at least us does n't have state monopolies , they have divine `` state of capitalism monopolies '', 
  well , you steal , confess in church and then pay for indulgence - oh wait , it 's different time now , so you do something illegal , then apologize when it 's uncovered and swipe it under a rug as soon as possible so it wo n't be spoken about on media, 
  actually they were in russia since soviet union and until now ... 
  could have been published somewhere else first ? 
   it should , instead , serve as a catalyst for the various eu nation states to impose really strict regulations in regards to political ** or religious ** donations and funding . 
  the people must demand a stop of ** foreign ** interference . 
  fixed there for you, 
  non-governmental organization funded by foreign state , what a surprise, 
  democracy ca n't happen from empty space , people have to be educated for at least 2 generations for it to be stable , there have to be base for it built fro general populace . 
  and then education have to be maintained or with time it will turn to various forms of tyranny once again . 
  no democratic country is invulnerable to this , even us have some signs of decay , at least from external observer of their police separation from populace . 
  probably because majority does n't care . 
  general level of `` care '' decreases in progression of distance from person location to location of event, 
  weird considering that us was going to considers cyber attacks as aggression and answer with military . 
  does that mean they are not going forward with this plan anymore ? 
  and not in eu , no obligations,

  there are still plenty of former nazies in bva even though there were legislation to prevent it, 
  good , i hope they will keep it this way, 
  no highrisers , nice, 
  also hamburg , one of only few known cases of manmade fire tornado in human history , 450m of fire, 
  sm3 at deveselu and redzikowo ? 
  in terms of power , nothing really changed, 
  might be related to wording , here it says `` considering '', 
  move to us , they look like trustworthy, 
  do you feel more secure or less ?
