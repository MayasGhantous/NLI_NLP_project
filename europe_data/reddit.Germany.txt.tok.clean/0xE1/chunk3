  or do something to make sure democracy is not corrupted by liars ? 
  unfortunately `` common sense '' does not hold to it 's name and is not common, 
  it seems like it more and more with every passing week now =\\ maybe we 're in war already as some say ... 
  that 's uh , actually quite an interesting suggestion , though i 'm pretty sure northern ireland would be willing to join republic of ireland . 
  actually they all can join republic of ireland , that would make much more sense, 
  `` changes '' have not been that great for them in some regards, 
  well yeah , you have to abide laws, 
   the law has to be applied to everyone equally . 
  uh , yes please ? 
  and how would masses be able to tell truth from lies of said politicians if no-one would prosecute them ? 
  unfortunately it 's not popular in newspapers to write about politicians if they are still in their place . 
  that 's bold title for us newspaper  yet , his behavior in ukraine and syria violates not only the rules intended to promote peace instead of conflict , but also common human decency . 
  so directly founding , then supporting terrorism directly and then indirectly who now waging war all over east is not as bad now ? 
  [ text of the directive ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?qid=1444920189744&amp;uri=celex:31999l0044 ), 
  it 's called court, 
  biological degree is fitting for politician , one have to know how chemical driven beings are working and behaving to handle them properly . 
  also she 's estonishing lady !, 
  it 's not essentially too bad if these who 've been found lying would be torn to pieces by opponents , it will only make this said opponents more aware that this same would happen with them too if they would be found lying . 
  they would find more sophisticated ways to hide their lies , but that would also make it easier for others to go with truth instead . 
  oh beliv me i know really well what kinds of lies there are . 
  we do n't need to cover them all from start , blatant and evident lies would be more then enough to begin with, 
  it have to start somewhere , it had to be this way from beginning ... 
  it does n't make it acceptable that it 's happening all over the place , if we have to replace every lying mouth to make it better , then we have to do it . 
  you ca n't build truthful and open government with lies at it 's core . 
  when results do not equal to promises , when actions do n't follow said promises ? 
  take written promise , compare with action of said person . 
  if it 's not up to standard for the court , then get it to required level like normal people do . 
  it does n't have to be different from normal court , they have to be accountable for their for their own people as it 's their freaking job to serve said people . 
  lying to them is contrary to said job . 
  that would make a great law to restrain politicians , imaging world where they are prosecuted for lying to their people ? 
   we here in europe are n't quite used for such demonstrations no european country ( except for poland and lithuania ) have lost as much of it 's population as ussr ( even germany ) , not to mention how savaged the land was after german troops . 
  russian population have strong patriotic ties with military since then , not just in recent years . 
   the ussr entered wwii as an ally of the third reich yes , just like italy , japan , bulgaria , hungary , romania , thailand , iraq . 
  denmark had thousands of volunteers fighting in german army , also other states had volunteers there too , latvia and ukraine for example . 
  everyone remembers that , do n't elude yourself . 
  ussr have ended war as ally with uk , france , us and china . 
  should we mention that multiple businesses and even some government officials in us were doing business with nazi germany even during war , such as selling oil for example ? 
   size of american investments in nazi germany at the time of pearl harbor amounted to an estimated total of $ 475 million . 
  standard oil of new jersey had $ 120 million invested there ; general motors had $ 35 million ; itt had $ 30 million ; and ford had $ 17.5 million most binare was this :  walter schellenberg , was a prominent director and shareholder of itt by arrangement with new york please do n't use such an argument because it is not full and is out of context , all sides were involved in agreements with nazi germany, 
  how exactly is dressing in ww2 uniform and making toys in form of armored vehicles ** on victory day ** makes it a military hysteria ? 
  it only shows that people care a bit more about their past this days then it was several last years , and they got at least more flexible and creative , maybe even more free time to do something like this . 
  you 've linked photos people on day of victory , how is that related to people boasting mh17 shot down ? 
  i 'm absolutely certain that majority of people on this parades have grandparents who fought ww2 , it 's a day of remembrance after all . 
  you make it look like they are wearing this every fucking day as casual clothing . 
  if you think that people in russia are proud of shut down civilian airliner , you are an ** imbecile ** . 
  civil war ? 
  factories that were sent to ussr were part of reparations for war, 
  you 've made a conclusion about whole country and nation by action of single small group of people who 've made this atrocity of a cot which is questionable even in russia ? 
  good read , thanks for link !, 
  so that means that apple only doing itself harm by toying with developers by restricting access to hardware or not approving apps `` just because '' . 
  micosoft windows , yeah , both license sales to manufacturers and secureboot lock is a total dick move from microsoft . 
  lobbying is always a dirty business ... 
  but is n't windows a fruit basket too when it comes to it 's components like media player and browser ? 
  if anti-competition laws are applicable to multiple levels , then apple is clearly breaking market anti-competition law within app store by denying competitors to their own software . 
  yeah , changing mind due to new facts , accepting responsibility - are things people do n't do often , and when there are multiple people with this problem who are ruling country , it becomes country wide problem =\\, 
  yeah , i 'm quite angry it takes decade to get anything started against countries with state supported terrorism , but for russia it only took one ( probably accidentally ) downed plain, 
  problem is with corporations themselves rather than technology and their leverage over governments , which makes our current society not prepared for these technologies yet . 
  distribution of wealth have not improved in any way for last decade . 
  aah , i see now yeah , all pieces in place now , thanks for explanation !, 
  it 's a bit weird when anti-competitive laws are applied not to physical market , but a mix of physical and software . 
  apple is often using apple store review process as a way to deny apps that would compete with apple own apps like itunes in this example : https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/30/spotify-apple-music-competition/, 
  saudi arabia is state known for sponsoring terrorism directly and indirectly , usa and uk are known allies of saudi arabia , both countries media is also known for not letting any information or news related to saudi link to terrorism to go through . 
  are usa and uk obscuring facts like russia does ? 
  i see it as relevant , i really do , call me weird , but do n't call me troll just because you ca n't see the relevance, 
  android with google play or android in general ? 
  if first , then yeah , though it was much less . 
  thanks for link , short and explains it well . 
  though i ca n't grasp base principle how this law is applied on same level to software without breaking anything . 
  i still ca n't see why built-in browser in os is bad if it 's not sold by anyone to begin with as example with microsoft ( it was same reason , right ? 
  or i 've mixed two different cases there ? ), 
  though kind see now how android from google specifically is more attractive to hardware manufacturers due to vast variety of apps in google play . 
  why is no-one doing anything with apple than for default browser and dominant market abuse ? 
  especially questionable rules that no app shall compete with apple apps, 
  it 's not about putin trolls/bots either , but there we have wild discussion topic about them here too, 
  well , and if you 're wrong and i just have a weird opinion and views ? 
  i 'm failing miserably at it because it 's not my intention and topic at all . 
  stop living in world of black and white assumptions and sides . 
  yes , and i do n't see exactly why google play is worse in comparison with appstore . 
  you can ditch google play and have your own market with blackjack and hookers , you ca n't do any of it on appstore . 
  and that google is in control of it 's own service , wow , look , german government is on control of germany !, 
  so , if you sell phones with your operating system it 's fine and no-one cares , but if it 's also available as open source you are screwed ? 
  why not ? 
  we should start investigations into saudi and uea too , their relations to terrorist organisations , stop any relations with them and enforce ban for weapon sales . 
  russia is not comparable to them in any way ? 
  which one is worse then ? 
  it can be neutral . 
  i 'm not defending russia in this comment too if you have missed it , i 've only pointed that people need to focus on more countries who 's actions making this world less attractive for living . 
  and please do note that in this comment i have n't said to leave russia 's atrocities , only pointing that ignoring other countries atrocities is seen as double game . 
  do n't search for multiple meanings in text when there way be none . 
  oh look , someone actually does look into it : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/55dv9w/50_norwegian_organizations_call_for_investigation/, 
  hitler had a popular mustache for his time , and look at it now , ruined by actions of single person !, 
  even charlie chaplin ca n't restore it now . 
  practically the same , if it was used for bad , does n't mean it is bad . 
  many would n't even know about it like i until now . 
  so , not praising west or not blaming russia would get you automatically labeled as putin bot too ? 
  whataboutism is now a no-no and only about deflecting ? 
  no other way around it ? 
  er , please do target at part of my comment saying we should n't pursue russia for their wrongdoings . 
  what i 'm saying that we need to focus on saudi arabia ** too ** that can go in parallel , you know right ? 
  if only saudi arabia was targeted with similar amount of attention , we would have lived in better world,
