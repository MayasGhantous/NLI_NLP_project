  german embassy in moscow for example have checkpoint where documents are checked inside , not outside . 
  not even sure what russian policemen would be able to check anyway . 
  wish they would have released policeman protocol over this incident and justification of his actions . 
  hm , yeah , they are not showing footage without pausing it . 
  though it 's still not a good idea to disembark right in front of embassy at night time , and also , is he wearing a knitted cap ? 
  in july ? 
  * you do n't hurry to the foreign country government building * if you value your health , * in any country *, 
  that would be great , i would finally be able to afford a credit for a house for my family within 55km from m\u00fcnchen !, 
  does n't mean something should n't be done with it, 
  i thought murder and hiding evidence is crime in most countries, 
  they 'll send flowers and congratulate, 
  eh , europe ! = european union, 
  among two are probably belgium , germany , france and netherlands , after goes least probable to leave : italy , spain , poland . 
  not sure about austria and sweden . 
  many other countries depend strongly on eu , so their stay is related directly to economical situation in eu . 
  what about us ? 
  in both internal and external matters they have serious problems they are not even trying to fix . 
   any decision-making which would affect vast majority of population should be conducted by ** large ** majority of voters . 
  your example wo n't fit my example of how i see referendums of this magnitude should be conducted . 
  we cherish and talk about this because there 's no other ways right now . 
  this type of voting is 2600 + years , yet it still can leave majority of people in disadvantage , maybe it should n't be used everywhere ? 
  some countries practice [ election silence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/election_silence ) . 
   are they not capable of thinking for themselves and determining what is or is not good information ? 
  you might be overestimating people ...  they are n't cattle that need prodding by knowledgeable bureaucrats . 
  this is actually something i would love to see , because having at least most basic list of exact pros and cons would have been invaluable for many . 
  i do n't care about outcome , what i care about is righteousness for all sides , democracy screws a lot of people in this kind of referendums because it affects literally everyone . 
  what i mean is that democracy is not exactly a saving grace for everything , there have to be a better method of decision-making then black and white variants . 
  it have it flaws and ignoring large percentage of population is one of them, 
  but we would allow anyone , literally anyone including foreigners to sway voters right before votes ? 
  some germans look like refugees , some even worse, 
  so many in germany that it 's not even seen behind the blob , yet i 've barely heard about any troubles from these refugees . 
  it either have to be mandatory for all population and then 50 % is fair threshold or voluntary and have higher threshold , otherwise minority prevails in decision making . 
  ay , i learned that ignoring population is essence of democracy , no sarcasm, 
  still above survival minimum , meh, 
  also french number pronouncement system is one of nightmares for anyone outside of french language . 
  yeah , i think this kind of decisions should had required mandatory referendum, 
  yeah , i already found that it actually is democracy and this particular side of it sucks because it 's ignoring parts of population . 
  i do n't care about outcome , does n't not affect me directly in any way . 
  that yeah , quite large percentage of young people for example just did n't show up , and most of them were for not leaving . 
  on the bright side for britain though , their local manufacturers will have much better and well protected local market for their goods , that is a lot of jobs, 
  [ their own bucking fault for not showing up ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36616028 ), 
  bumer , it 's where democracy sucks then , because this referendum affects everyone , and about half of population have to be * completely * ignored ... 
  in my view this is exactly where democracy failed people of britain, 
  that 's exactly what i 'm trying to say ,  but it does n't work if you choose to ignore it using your own words , they ca n't just ignore 48 % :3 if they will exit , but under condition of keeping ** some ** of important aspects , like freedom of movement , that would be fair to these 48 % for example . 
  but the core problem of exiting is that britain ca n't exit and keep benefits , they are no longer in union . 
  also , i think this referendum should have been mandatory for all population ... 
  but none of two options would be democratic in outcome , 48 % of voters were part of this same referendum , you ca n't just ignore it now they need to find way to please both sides somehow . 
  * my opinion : they should had majority threshold instead of 50 %, 
  they might actually work , ca n't say , but when trashing city and police is involved , that 's not nice at all . 
  not your problem , you checked original source link and not a repost-source for duplicates . 
  true , though practically neither of these options are democratic =\\, 
  do n't exit , but fix the reason why people want to exit , or else they 'll split - it 's a clear message to government of britain and eu that they are doing something wrong and need to get their shit together asap . 
  exactly , ignoring nearly 50 % of population would not be democratic . 
  ** update : ** should have used `` fair '' instead of `` democratic '' , it is democracy in this case , `` rule of the majority '', 
  * anything to conquer more land * ^ sarcasm, 
   some ministers had feared that these clauses would scare away multinational investors . 
  well fuck those investors who is not going to pay taxes anyway, 
  nothing new ... 
  many of world top officials ca n't be trusted according to leaking documents , never should 've been trusted and never should be i think . 
  russia is nuclear weapon manufacturer and holder , like britain and us , these countries are not . 
  nato have no control over nuclear weapons in allied countries , it 's completely outside of their jurisdiction . 
  it 's seems it 's not that good after all : http://www.dw.com/en/study-large-number-of-turks-in-germany-put-islam-above-the-law/a-19336757 =\\, 
  ss is only if lost revenue for bulgaria , not that important now if there 's no compensation required . 
  i 'm mostly about nuclear central project , surely international chamber of commerce in geneva would have ruled in favor of bulgaria if it was found that russia have failed the contract and not the other way around ... 
  no , for this :  under western pressure , bulgaria abandoned plans to build a nuclear central with russian technology , and gave up the south stream gas pipeline project  the international court of arbitration at the international chamber of commerce in geneva ruled in favor of the russian atomstroyexport company . 
    atomstroy will receive $ 620 million in compensation from bulgaria , a huge sum for the impoverished country . 
  i do hope bulgaria will receive compensation for allied antics . 
  this is quite a serious step because in internet , there 's always a way to hide origin , or in other words , pretend as other country in origin . 
  it 's also harder to show to public that this kind of attack had really happend and had not been made up . 
  this may result in much stronger surveillance all around the world and harsher laws , german `` wi-fi law '' would look pale in comparison ... update : this would also turn security researchers into aggressors ... 
  5 apples , 2 people : 1 person eaten 4 apples . 
  using statistics method from this chart , population eat 2.5 apples per capita . 
  * this was very informative and constructive comment , thank you for your invaluable input !, 
  well , i 've seen quite a lot of wildlife bridges over interstates in germany . 
  also berlin have weird amount of different animals living in city , foxes , ravens , rabbits ( or whatever their varieties are called , not sure ) , even bats !, 
  do i presume correctly that over time , hooligan football fans have discouraged other fans and so became majority ? 
  as it became their main gathering event . 
  poverty probably played main role there too ? 
  oh wow , interesting development . 
  if there are wolves , they do eat something , does that mean there 's also increase in population of non-carnivores animals ? 
  huh , did n't know there were wolves between potsdam and leipzig . 
  they are here to defend us from invaders from east !, 
  or they 've came from chernobyl . 
  educated people all over the world misinterpret bible all the time ... 
  i have neighbor from iran , they are nice people , never seen anyone of them abused even when they had loud disputes . 
  and i do hope that majority of muslims are like these family , just normal . 
  [ surprise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caning_in_singapore ) , but seriously , if noone will enforcing law when it 's evidently broken , that * law is not working *, 
  small street with mostly just private houses , biergarten , bar and cafe . 
  they 've been yelling at women at cafe to cover and go home , then gone to bar and demanded them to stop selling alcohol . 
  police did came some time after , arrested 4 of them . 
  i 'm the source , this happened in munich in area i live near . 
  there are fascists in russia and ukraine , surprise ? 
  if authorities know and do n't prosecute you well , legally you 've have clear record still, 
  life lesson : if you happened to be on same picture as other person , you 're his pal [ uh ] ( http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2015/04/02/angela-merkel.jpg ) , [ oh ] ( http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_32/721166/trump-hillary-bill-clinton-today-150807_460ba7dfbcabbf6b9cd94249a410f990.today-inline-large.jpg ), 
  problem is that islam laws are religion laws like bible , not state laws . 
  even though state is separate from church in german and us , they are not in islamic countries , and they often not only live by these laws , there were cases were these laws were enforced by themselves ( especially in their ghetto 's ) , and even enforced over other non-islamic citizens . 
  i do n't deny that it was illegal , but so far it looks just like us law on copyright , not taken action , your loss, 
  how are islamic laws not related to polygamous marriages which are allowed by that same law ? 
  i do bloody hope so , but we ca n't see it 3 . 
  more reason to have it either updated or thrown away,
