* the intellectual property ** plundered ** by the us in west germany alone amounts to more than 10 billion us $ * the occupation costs for the us forces alone were higher than all the money the marshall plan broght into germany . 
  the occupation costs west germany had to pay to the us alone was more than 4.5 billion dm in 1950 alone . 
  german newspaper stern reported about it and was censored by the us occupation forces . 
  * germans were forced into forced labor for years . 
  * scientists and researchers were kidnapped and brought into the us * nazi war criminals like wernher von braun - who were responsible for forced labour in concentration camps like mittelbau dora , were some of my relatives died , were n't prosecuted but brought to the us to built the nasa . 
  * us forces plundered , killed and raped civilians . 
  not only the russians did so . 
  * feel free to educate yourself about those facts . 
  indeed , germany is * giving * money to ukraine , not plundering it like the us etc. 
  did after ww2 . 
  i think there are bigger problems than comparing degrees , but it 's a first step . 
  from a formal point of view this was achieved with the bologna process . 
  we had to switch to the bachelor/master system in germany some years ago to make all degrees in the eu comparable . 
  but this only formal , it says nothing about the quality of the degree or the standards of teaching . 
  or the role of the uni in the educational system . 
  a similar process is currently done in the tvet field with the european qualifications framework eqf and the ecvet system . 
  the basic idea is to create a table for each country that sorts the degrees into standardized levels . 
  this way you can compare a french degree with a romanian and a swedish one . 
  but there are also several caveats , there is for example only one level for a doctoral degree , but some countries like germany have to levels of them that can not be translated into the nqf table . 
  it is really an interesting field of research with a lot of complex problems and coordination . 
  but i hope that it will bring european countries closer together and boost our economies . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_qualifications_framework http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_credit_system_for_vocational_education_and_training, 
  different schools and degrees can be compared in a scientific way , that 's what my research is about . 
  however , this is a very complex task even without corruption and bribery . 
  different countries have different educational systems . 
  due to our strong tvet system in germany only ca . 
  25 % of population hold an academic degree . 
  the universit\u00e4ten in germany do scientific training , not vocational training . 
  the unis in germany also have the same high standards of teaching and research , there are no mickey-mouse-colleges and ivy leagues as in other countries . 
  other countries have a different approach eg . 
  spain and france relying heavily on universities for training with a more differentiated university system . 
  so comparing an engineering degree from a german universit\u00e4t and a spanish uni is a task on it 's own . 
  very complex . 
   the fact that michalovce with population of 40 000 has 3 ( or more ... ) universities ( by that i mean few departments of them and you do `` long distance '' studying ) is ridiculous . 
  depends on what those unis are doing . 
  in germany we have the universit\u00e4t , based on the medieval unis . 
  they do research and train scientist . 
  so if you study marketing at a german universit\u00e4t , you will get a lot of theory , models and math . 
  since the 1970s we also have fachhochschulen in germany , former engineering schools . 
  they also follow scientific principles , but teach a more practical approach . 
  they also do n't teach humanities , social sciences , law or medicine . 
  fachhochschulen are usually a bit smaller and also located in smaller towns . 
  the german companies know about the differences and use the graduates accordingly . 
  i really like the work done with eqf/ecvet , but i fear comparison will only be done on paper ignoring the different standards and training systems . 
   what would be interesting is how comparable the standards of the degrees are . 
   tens of thousands of soviet officers , obeying the orders of the supreme command , went from their warm barracks to live in moldy tents set up in the middle of sodden snow-covered fields . 
  in many instances along with their families . 
  because the billions of dm germany paid for the housing was misappropriated by the nomenklatura . 
   if tomorrow in germany , the americans open a concentration camp for russians , half of you will immediately submit their curriculum vitaefor jobs as operators of the gas chambers , and your press will start to explain how this camp is patriotic and good for the german economy . 
  the russians build the archipelago on their very own . 
  france is a net importer of energy from germany : http://www.rte-france.com/fr/actualites-dossiers/a-la-une/rte-publie-le-bilan-electrique-2012-1 http://www.renewablesinternational.net/france-net-power-exporter-except-to-germany/150/537/59937/ http://energytransition.de/2014/03/german-imports-of-nuclear-power-myth-revisited/ german energy is imported into austria : http://www.renewablesinternational.net/austria-to-discontinue-imports-of-nuclear-power/150/537/38088/ http://www.dw.de/power-exports-peak-despite-nuclear-phase-out/a-16370444, 
   basically more nuclear = less putin . 
  so it 's really that easy ? 
   but they buy it from czech plants and from germany . 
  but there was a proposal to boycott the import of nuclear energy in 2013 . 
  do n't know how this turned out , as it is probably against eu laws . 
  the church was not much oppressed in the gdr . 
  they could freely live their religion . 
   so german-registered cars get a loophole but everyone else still pays more . 
  this is bullshit , every car has to pay a fee for the autobahn . 
   german drivers wo n't pay more overall . 
  feel free to pay kfz-steuer in germany , it will also be lowered for you , no matter if you are german or not . 
  the news article is just sensational bullshit by a bunch of idiots creating click baits . 
   i was referring to the fact that this car toll is specifically only levied on certain nationalities . 
  it is not , it 's for anyone driving on the autobahn , regardless of nationality . 
   it seems like this is totally incompatible with freedom of movement , whether it 's germany doing it or any other member state . 
  having to pay for the autobahn as nothing to do with freedom of movement , or should every bus/train also be free ? 
   is it really true that other european countries have something similar to this already ? 
  which ones ?

   if you want to see a german company that is exporting that model , have a look at vw . 
  they 're , for example , trying to get chattanooga unionised because they ca n't stand having no works council to talk to . 
  german gewerkschaften and american unions are completely different things , though . 
  american unions ca n't handle the freedom and responsibilities german gewerkschaften enjoy . 
   but seriously while the article might have a lot of things that could be argued about i think there is a small kernel truth there somewhere and it all traces back to the german mittelstand . 
  mittelstand is n't the only factor , the tvet system is far more important , imnsho . 
  we get great scientist from our universit\u00e4ten , more practically oriented but still somehow sciency people from the fhn and very well trained skilled labour from our tvet system . 
  also , the skilled labour really have career path and training possibilities that do n't exist in other countries ( meister , techniker , betriebswirt ) . 
  the acceptance of that system leads to a well trained workforce which takes pride in their jobs and skills ( see the history of the gewerkschaften ) and allows companies to create innovative high tech products . 
   the german educational system is puny compared to the massive us programs plus one can not even compare the pathetic phd 's issued in germany with that of the us system . 
  yeah , especially those pathetic habilitationen ... 
   west and east germany is a completely different story from eastern europe . 
  west germany received for the whole duration of the cold war financial and military aid from the united states ( see the marshall plan ) , and it also benefited from free trade with the other western countries , which helped them a lot to recover after wwii . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  both , west and east germany were plundered . 
  west germany had to pay more for it 's occupation forces in one singel year than it received as a * loan * during marshall fund . 
  especially north korea . 
  that 's why there are strategic gas reserves . 
  we support your war of terror !, 
   why did n't you correct me in my first reply before our `` feud '' started ? 
  so * you * being to dumb too read is my fault ? 
  holy fuck . 
   you previously stated that romania and bulgaria do n't have vocational training systems , i said : romania and bulgaria do not have a vocational training system ** comparable to germany ** , if you are too dumb to read and quote , it 's your fault . 
   and you do ? 
  indeed i do . 
  i am doing research regarding the compatibility of degrees and developing curricula for the german tvet system . 
  see for example ecvet and the nqf . 
   this is the second time i 'm correcting you . 
  will it be the last ? 
  you are not correcting me , you do not understand the subject .
