  but now there are less school-leavers and those who do get more picky . 
  they are no longer interested in working as a chef every holiday for minimum wage . 
  another thing is that every apprenticeship certificate ( of apprenticeships with the same length ) has formally the same value , though some apprenticeships differ vastly with regards to their challenges . 
  software developers have to do a lot more maths than bricklayers , yet their qualification is formally the same . 
  [ that house my mom works in ] ( http://img.fotocommunity.com/rathaus-wernigerode-zur-blauen-stunde-65167b03-d766-4eec-b29f-be8730786798.jpg?width=1000 ), 
   even the bloody concierge at a major hotel in moscow city did n't understand a word of english . 
  the international information at domodedowo * international * airport did n't speak a single word of english . 
  i worked for a environmental research centre in germany some years ago , that would be a great option for both degrees , environmental science and health management . 
   i studied environmental science/gis but jobs are hard to come by and not what i wanted ( a lot of sitting on the computer ) . 
  i 've kind of come to the decision that i want to move back to europe and switch fields completely to becoming a nurse or a physician 's assistant . 
  there are also programmes for health management , were you could heavily benefit from your environmental science/gis knowledge . 
  yeah , only bavarians and thuringians should be allowed to celebrate it . 
   most us degrees are recognized in germany . 
  the kmk says otherwise . 
   money is not a major problem , because life expenses in germany are way lower than in the us . 
  tell that those guys who ca n't even set up the required blocked account as proof of financial resources . 
  not for eu degrees . 
   i do n't get why e.g. 
  us students do n't make use of the cheaper education costs in some european countries . 
  most of them are n't allowed to study in germany because they do n't speak german , do n't have enough money and most important their degrees/diplomas are not recognised in germany , therefor not allowing them to study here . 
  the first sex ed happened in 2nd grade . 
  a midwife came to our class and explained pretty much everything including homosexuality . 
  there was also a great children 's book available about sex ed . 
  in later forms we had sex ed again , but with a more scientific focus , including stis and such . 
  it was mostly part of biology , but we also had discussions about society and sex ( eg homosexuality , transgender etc. ), 
  in social sciences . 
   perl perl , the only programming language that looks the same before and after encryption . 
   is the german of that children 's song archaic , dialectal , slang , poetic , or something ? 
  i really do n't recognize those inflections from school ... 
  i do think i 've managed to deduce the gist of it : it 's a dialect from southern germany . 
  they broke the windows and pulled the lead from it . 
   i thought gott mit uns was already a well established saying it 's from the bible and therefor well known , but it was only chosen to be the official motto of prussia in 1701 in remembrance of gustav adolph . 
   but all i 've ever heard from germany about that war seem to portray sweden as evil itself . 
  yeah , there is a famous childrens song about the swedish army , but afaik it comes from the catholic parts . 
  http://fuerthwiki.de/wiki/index.php/drei\u00dfigj\u00e4hriger_krieg#schweden-lied the * schwedentrunk * is also remembered . 
  but in my home region , which is the home of luther and heart of the protestant reformation , he is seen in positive light . 
  though he did n't come in time to save [ magdeburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sack_of_magdeburg ) , we have streets named after gustav adolf and [ dietrich von falkenberg ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/dietrich_von_falkenberg ) . 
  edit : and prussia adopted * gott mit uns * as an official motto in 1701 . 
  it is a beer label . 
  the interesting point is that it is using a picture of swedish king gustav ii adolf as logo , because he liked that beer in 1632 . 
   r/ireland gets heaps of yanks coming over and i 've seen a fair bit of stupid questions & posts on there but the irish do n't really tolerate it so those posts stay at 0 and the op gets slagged off usually . 
  are you still salty because you did n't get a free snickers ? 
  i suggest [ this picture ] ( http://www.port01.com/uploads/cities/newsimages/2014/04/original/2014-04-02_17:20:39_lo_ur-krostitzer_480_jahre_4c.jpg ), 
  august 2003 saw a heatwave with almost 40 \u00b0 in many towns across germany . 
  unfortunately the heatwave hit the chaos communication camp organised by the chaos computer club . 
  some guys collapsed and the orga was giving out free mineral water to the masses . 
  [ * drink more water * ] ( http://skater.priv.at/~andy/events/computer/20030805-11_cccamp/20030810/20030810_124954.jpg ) signs were posted everywhere . 
  the [ datenklos ] ( https://events.ccc.de/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/klo1_400.jpg ) had to be wrapped in aluminium rescue blankets . 
  unfortunately , the power supply of one of my hp apollos died . 
  we had several exotic hardware assembled at the netbsd tent , some of them did n't like the heat . 
  the nights were great , drinking club mate and gulden draak with hackers from all over the world and watching nmap porn on a huge screen . 
  good times . 
  you do n't have many dutch on your part of the autobahn ? 
  they built a wall and made the slavics pay for it !, 
  there are some groups that want to reinstate them , but they are n't considered serious by anyone . 
   makes for a funny accent when speaking german . 
  one can often hear a french influence in it , especially in words like kirchberg which sounds a bit like k\u00fcrschberch . 
   luxembourgish sounds like a drunk dutchmen trying to speak german . 
   volkswagens are seen as nice cars in the usa but extremely unreliable they are built by us workers in the us or mexicans in mexico . 
  they are not on par with german workers regarding training and especially work ethics . 
  so the quality of vw usa or mexico is not on par with vw germany . 
   and lynxes are quite rare in germany , some years ago lynxes from zoos were released into the wild . 
  one of them seemed to be raised by zookeepers , as he liked to stroll around in the train station to plunder litter bins . 
  which frightened the tourists . 
  however , seeing one in the wild is almost impossible , as they spot you long before you can see them . 
  besides that , i have seen a wolf , lots of foxes , wild boars , badgers , deers and many blind worms . 
  and you have to drive carefully , people get killed when they crash into deers or boars . 
  i once tried to help a driver who hit a boar and the boar crashed through the windshield and into the car , basically splitting the driver in two parts . 
  drinne . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationale_front_ ( ddr ), 
  caspar schamberger , a surgeon , went to japan with the dutch east india compagnie and got the japanese interested in western medicine . 
  friedrich zu eulenburg was sent on an official mission to east asia to establish relationships between japan and prussia . 
  the japanese sent the iwakura-mission to germany in 1873 . 
  sexual things are also in there , verfickter wichser !, 
  yes , it is . 
  the word is arubaito , which is derived from arbeit . 
  prussia had a huge influence on japan , up until the 1970s medical files in japan were written in german . 
  the japanese culture is not so different from german culture as op thinks . 
  the joke lies in where the japanese word comes from and why . 
   it 's right up there with blade runner . 
  did you read the book by dick ? 
   japan has a very different culture . 
  yeah , all \u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8 and no fun . 
  yeah , the famous kl\u00f6tenhummel .

  in my current hometown the elbe floodings in 2002 and 2013 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_european_floods https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_european_floods, 
   try asking in r/germany , too . 
  it 's full of expats and i 'm pretty sure i 've seen a few english teachers there . 
  those questions show up often , usually by americans whose only qualification is being a native speaker . 
  for normal schools it 's almost impossible to become a teacher . 
  one will need a master 's in education , at least 2 subjects and the in school teacher training ( referendariat ) . 
  working at a university usually only requires a master 's degree if you just want to teach sprachpraxis . 
  but that would also require being fluent in german . 
   and is incredibly competitive . 
  especially in fields like languages . 
  sure , it 's a human right . 
  human dignity shall be inviolable . 
  to respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority . 
  he fits quite well into the diagnostic criteria of icd 10 f60 .8 . 
  up until 1989 .
