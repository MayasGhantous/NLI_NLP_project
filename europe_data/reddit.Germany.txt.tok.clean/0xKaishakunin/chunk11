  if you did n't vote , police showed up and dragged you to the ballots . 
  and basically everything ( like note voting on the ballot or crossing out everything ) counted as vote for the national front . 
  feces ( schei\u00dfe / shit ) , genitals , fucking and some old religious stuff . 
  i am sooo going to introduce this in german . 
   who gives a shit ? 
  he seems to be a narcissist , and as such he only cares about himself and might change his views on an hourly basis . 
  little dwarves living in a dark forrest building cars and cuckoo clocks . 
  well , they are n't exactly better than germany . 
  did you change your name already ? 
  to klaus ? 
  depends on where in germany you are . 
  more common in the flat parts ( north ) and in bigger towns . 
  traffic here is pretty safe , yet you have to watch out for cars and lorries ignoring you . 
  rat means advice but also council . 
  the rathaus is the house of the town 's council . 
   what is the townhall called ? 
  which city is it located ? 
  it 's the rathaus ( literally townhall ) of wernigerode . 
  the whole inner city of wernigerode is still intact . 
  we also have a [ castle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/wernigerodecastlewinter.jpg ) , [ a cozy weihnachtsmarkt ] ( http://www.wernigerode.de/media/weihnachtsmarkt/weihnachtsmarkt-kopfbilder/cl1050x480_002_weihnachtsmarkt_wernigerode.png ) , lots of old [ framework houses ] ( http://www.harzbahn.de/images/wernigerode-schlossblick-hz11_3516.jpg ) and a [ cute narrow gauge railway ] ( http://img.fotocommunity.com/harzer-schmalspurbahn-0c31453c-d35d-4e72-b774-28b702b0d3b2.jpg?height=1080 ) with legendary [ locomotives ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/lok_99_222_im_bahnhof_wernigerode.jpg ) . 
  but we also have [ plattenbauten ] ( http://www.wwg-wr.de/images/wwb_img6.jpg ) there . 
   how was making that hacker philosophy video interesting ? 
  it was interesting to make explain all that stuff to juveniles . 
  they did a series on cyber cyber topics and i got asked to do a part on social engineering and secure passwords and on drones . 
  so we had to write some kind of story that could be used as a framework for the clip . 
  we had some time left after finishing the two planned clips and i got asked by the staff there why i call myself a hacker . 
  so we got into a discussion and i explained were the term came from and what it means and how it got butchered by the media . 
  since some time was left , we did a 3rd clip , the one shown . 
  filming was also special , the puppeteers were dubbed over in the after procession and did not really interact with me during filming . 
  so i had to interact with two puppets with no facial expressions and no real text . 
  that was kind of interesting but also a bit exhausting . 
  the [ townhall ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3s91xzw.jpg ) were my mother works in . 
  she is in it since 1973 .

  der mais , der mais , der demonstriert . 
  yeah , but i meant not only the oktoberfest with those cliches , but all the other stuff too . 
   the only difference is americans seem to assume it 's a `` german '' thing they often assume bavarian cliches are german . 
  like that guy in / r/de or / r/germany who wanted a traditional lederhose because his great grandpa was from rostock . 
  but i think that cultural appropriation stuff has a lot to do with how americans link culture and identity to skin colour . 
  see all the sas stuff about tiny , homogenous european countries like belgium or switzerland . 
  the trifecta of fast food : - x, 
   or americans having `` an oktoberfest '' in town pretending like it 's some sort of german tradition ? 
  yeah , because we totally not do it in germany either . 
  dafuq is an oktoberfest in berlin , hamburg or hannover ? 
  it 's hard to find any religious people in my region . 
  there are 28 eu member countries with 28 different educational systems . 
  it depends on where you want to go . 
  does probably not accept your high school diploma and community college degrees as an academic degree . 
  other countries might handle it different . 
  that 's why you have to look out for socks , sandals * and * jack wolfskin . 
  flotus and jetus, 
   germany has them too !, 
  they were invented in germany . 
  by lutherans . 
  yes , the hr indicates . 
  but everything south of prussia is yugoslavia . 
  probably a byproduct of dr. oetkers international pizza line . 
   kongres\u00f3wka is that a town or congress poland ? 
  http://imgur.com/a/3mlnl a gallery from dec. 2015 showing our chicklets and barn cats . 
  too many to name , just a few : * german shepherd dog * dackel * rottweiler * dobermann * leonberger * deutsch drahthaar * weimaraner * zwergspitz * [ trakehner ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/trakehner_reithengst%2c_auktion_neum\u00fcnster_2004.jpg ) * hanoveraner * rheinisches kaltblut * [ deutsche langschan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/hahn%2c_frontansicht.jpg ), 
  ! \u0634\u0627\u0643\u0650\u0631\u0629 \u0634\u0627\u0643\u0650\u0631\u0629 btw : where is our yugoslavian shakira bot ? 
  is every teacher a professor or only those at a gymnasium ? 
  one thing i noticed when i am in vienna with our research colleagues or at the uni is how they use their titles when getting introduced . 
  like frau magister m\u00fcller and herr ingenieur mayr . 
  something i have n't seen like that in de . 
  degrees below a dr. are usually ignored in germany , mostly even profs. 
  but that might be different in medicine and law . 
  there is only one kaiser and that 's franz !, 
  is that a normal univ prof , some honourary title or a title for teachers ? 
  magister , dipl-ing and master 's were usually mentioned by austrians at conferences i attended there , but that might be a conference/uni thing . 
  keks comes from cakes . 
   or the day after valborg ( april 30 ) as some one from the harz : i fucking hate walpurgisnacht . 
  were n't a lot of litter bins removed because the ira used them to hide bombs ? 
  that 's what i read about london at least . 
  did she have the vorboten as opening act ? 
   municipal law the ordnungsamt should go after the parties , and sometimes they do . 
  g\u00f6rlitz is quite popular for it 's pretty ww2 architecture and was used in grand budapest hotel as location . 
  then you have old castles like blankenburg , falkenstein or moritzburg used in films like aschenbr\u00f6del or black death with sean bean . 
  some of the east german movies about native americans were partially filmed in yugoslavia and the harz area . 
  my mom even was an extra as a 12 year old girl in a gojko mitic movie . 
  it was very hot in moscow in may . 
  i got a severe sun burn , which i did not expect . 
  the sent out [ their special forces to subjugate europe ] ( https://cdn.empowernetwork.com/user_images/post/2013/12/27/d/91/848c/540x293_20131227_d91848c010b677719abd7b029ad4934e_jpg.jpg ), 
  the conference was great . 
  my talk was translated from english to russian and well received . 
  the conference itself was a bit larger than other conferences , but i assume that has to with moscow being so central for russia . 
  i spent a week there as holidays and it was great to roam moscow , visiting the kremlin and experiencing moscow traffic . 
  sadly , my russian is n't good enough to communicate with native speakers . 
  i spoke at a hacking conference in moscow last year and was a bit surprised that neither the international information at domodedowo nor the people in the world trade center spoke english . 
  but otoh my russian is also sub par due to stupid teaching methods . 
  it was quite an interesting experience . 
  i wrote a bigger explanation in sas , but ca n't find it in my history . 
  note that operationalising something as complex as an educational system is very , very complicated and often biased . 
  some organisations in germany create rankings to pressure politicians into privatising education for monetary reasons . 
  i let my students create a ranking system where german and german-like unis outperformed every other country simply by using different factors , eg . 
  students/professor rate , but a professor had to have a dr. * and * a habilitation , which is almost never the case in the us and uk , so they performed very low in this field . 
  putting a penalty on the university if they took tuition fees was another way to penalize us and uk unis , as well as looking for freedom of research and science in the constitution . 
  also note that the eu tried to harmonise the tvet systems in the all member states ( cf. 
  cedefop , europass and eqf ) like they did with the universities , but stopped that process due to too much complexity .
