  anyway , here are 3 threads which should give you at least in an insight . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/5ec04x/antiamericanism_allows_you_to_assign_negative/dabespz/ https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1wiaqb/german_universities_why_are_they_ranked_so_low/cf2t14s/ https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/27s8yz/german_vocational_training/ci4778p/, 
  those rankings are bullshit . 
  they are neither objective nor valid . 
   quite contrary , it creates mobilization reserve -- something very useful in case of a big war . 
  install a kr\u00fcmpersystem like the one developed by scharnhorst in 1806 . 
  since napoleon limited the size of the standing army of prussia , scharnhorst advised to release a percentage of active soldiers every month and replace them with new recruits . 
  those were trained for 2 month , released and replaced by new recruit . 
  this way prussia had a small but professionell standing army and a large pool of reservists to built up units for the wars in 1812/1813 . 
  yes , since 1956 , when an inch was standardised to 25,4 mm . 
  in medieval times it was defined as the width of a thumb , usually that of the local ruler . 
  were we had pretty much of in germany . 
  finally finishing another 2 books i am working on . 
  it 's just so hard to sit down and write them in the evening . 
   `` german beer '' is n't a thing though . 
  it 's rather a diverse and local thing . 
  americans ca n't comprehend how large and diverse germany is . 
  it 's basically [ made of different countries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/hrr_1400.png ) . 
  in some parts we call it bier , in others pils , helles or even wei\u00dfe . 
  harzkristall is selling christmas pickles as a typical german tradition . 
  but both countries have a bunch of americans looking for dirndl , strudel and the sound of music . 
  dreiviertel is mostly used in southern and east germany . 
  it was used in east german tv and therefor introduced to the northern parts ( mecklenburg etc. ), 
  of the gdr . 
  my family there understood it , but did not use it actively . 
   gros - one gros is 144 things ( 12x12 - a dozen dozens )  en gros is still used , but it usually just means a lot and not 144 pieces . 
  the * schock * was still used by my grandparents , it 's 60 pcs = 5x12, 
  that 's an eu requirement to have the cm displayed . 
  in germany we still use zoll ( inch ) for pipes and hoses in plumbing . 
  oh , and the yardstick is called zollstock ( lit . 
  inchstick ) it 's neither a stick nor does it display inches . 
   plusquamperfekt , futur 2 or the pr\u00e4teritum past tense but nobody uses that here . 
  it 's useful when you want to confuse foreigners or write in a kafkaesque style . 
   in german , once you know the rules of pronunciation , you can pronounce pretty much every word even if you do n't know them . 
  spell it as you pronounce it . 
  accounting and computer science . 
   ( kiek in de k\u00f6k tower [ we got one too in magdeburg ] ( http://img.marcopolo.de/api/content/images/image/0/3/th/6x/t1024/u/photo-6414153.jpg?1465574867493 ), 
  you can chose your brides name on marriage . 
  changing your last name is almost impossible in germany , unless it sounds derogatory or creates psychological problems . 
  one way around this could be the use of an artist ` s name . 
  if your ema accepts reddit , they will put schwertritter into your ausweis, 
   if your house was built with the advantage of modern technology , it 's walls have studs . 
  walls are made of concrete and steel . 
  sure , it 's a normal word . 
  a long one , but a correct word . 
  the translation is pretty correct , but we use that word more ironically . 
  a sollbruchstelle is a * predetermined breaking point * , which itself is a very technical term , used by engineers . 
  for example , the [ beverage pull tab of tin cans ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/beverage_pull_tab.jpg ) uses a predetermined breaking point to get ripped out of the can . 
  the [ eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher ] ( https://blog.ikarus.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/take2-eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher_ablauf.jpg ) is a more or less satirical named device to behead eggs . 
  we can simply combine words in german to create new words , but this is done mostly in technical terminology , but not in everyday language . 
  and this name is a play on that . 
  so , to name this explanation , i gave you the * eierschalensollbruchstellenverursachertestmaschinengenusnormierungsrichtlinienworttesterkl\u00e4rungsver\u00f6ffentlichung * . 
   german police is organized by states plus federal police and customs police . 
  and bundestagspolizei . 
  people always overlook those 210 guys ...  / r/de as a german sub . 
  / r/germany should be better suited . 
  you have to make the eierschalensollbruchstellenverursachertestmaschinengenusnormierungsrichtlinienworttest, 
  [ this one ] ( https://finnswelt.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/baby-flash.jpg ), 
  according to the eierschalensollbruchstellenverursachertestmaschinengenusnormierungsrichtlinie ? 
  have you ever tried to fix a nail in a wall without a d\u00fcbel ? 
  you have to fix it with plaster cast , which is neither simple nor elegant . 
  of course we have a simulator for it http://www.hostradamus.de/pics/bs01.jpg, 
  sure , my parents looked into them . 
  my mom was allowed to travel to west germany to visit relatives and my father was allowed to work close to the border . 
  as we already expected , a relative was spying on us , one of my teachers and several colleagues of my mom . 
  one of them was the official inofficial collaborator but someone else was also spying . 
  not really a political drama but a great movie nonetheless : schtonk !, 
  about the hitler diaries affair . 
  it 's just absolutely hilarious . 
   well , my military stategic knowledge largly stems from the civ games , so take it with a grain of salt , but i 'd say in real life , you only send an army if there is even the slightest chance that they can achieve their objective . 
  i think the memory of the kiel mutiny was fresh back then . 
  the voice artists were so great . 
  pferderoulade is also delicious . 
  a good horse sausage . 
  300 $ and 20 $ in coins , but just because i was attending a conference in vienna and prefer to have some extra cash on me . 
  i usually carry ca . 
  100 $ and reload once it goes below 20 $ . 
  when martin luther translated the bible from old hebrew/aramaic/old greek he coined a lot of new terms like vorhaut , scherflein or denkzettel . 
  he is n't a mercedes , is n't he ? 
  gothic 1 , 2 & 3, 
   countries do n't just go to war because it 's funny . 
  war is the continuation of politics by other means . 
   kleiner brauner is out . 
  he killed himself in berlin in 1945 . 
  countries are made up of federal states . 
  in case of the gurke it 's like that : http://www.austria-cafe.com/img/fedprov.gif, 
  i have a poster of bud spencer , which is way more important . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naked_among_wolves_ ( 1963_film ), 
   does n't steuer mean taxes in german ? 
  here ` stuur ' is the same as english ` steer ' steuer means both , tax and steer . 
  a helmsman is a steuermann . 
  yes , etymology is a hobby of mine since i worked as a programmer for a research project about a new [ \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c ] ( http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/category_240.ahtml ), 
  cool , my grandma still called all sofas * chaiselongue * . 
  which also exists as a loan word in russian : \u0448\u0435\u0437\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0433, 
  so it 's named after the company messerschmitt ? 
   messerschmidt where does this come from ? 
   \u0161ank i assume this is a loanword from german/austrian schank ? 
   \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d do you only use diwan for sofa/couch/diwan or are there different words in russian ? 
   stuurlui it took me some time to figure this word out , but i guess it 's * steuerleute * ? 
   i hear austrians have great basements , though .
