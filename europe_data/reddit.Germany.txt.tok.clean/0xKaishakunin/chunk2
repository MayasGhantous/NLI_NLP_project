   but you clearly need to learn more about the subject . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  please try at least to understand the press release of the diw , the article , and the subject . 
  go and at least * try * to understand ecvet and all related projects . 
   i do n't see why not . 
  because the academic and tvet systems differ between the involved countries . 
  in germany , there is even a difference between a degree made at a fachhochschule or universit\u00e4t , though they are formally the same . 
   you seem to be misreading the article though . 
  it never states that romania and bulgaria have more academics . 
  it says romanian and bulgarian migrants are more likely to have a degree than a native german . 
  it therefor considers a degree made in bulgaria the same as one made in germany . 
  this is not true . 
  a german meister or techniker has a better training regarding * handlungskompetenz * than a romanian m.eng. , yet the latter is considered to be an academic . 
  those people who simply * compare * formal degrees have no clue about educational systems around the world . 
   a study by a renowned think tank the institut der deutschen wirtschaft k\u00f6ln e.v. 
  is financed by industrial and employers ' associations lobbying groups . 
  they are not independent . 
   he pointed out that roughly 25 percent of migrants from romania and bulgaria had an academic degree , against only 19 percent among native germans . 
  yeah , because academic degrees can be compared that easily . 
  romania and bulgaria do not have a vocational training system comparable to germany , of course they have a higher number of `` academics '' . 
  but they are not necessarily at the same quality as a german diplom or master . 
   things that does n't translate well ftfy you also do n't get the sarcasm in * this * topic ? 
   is that sarcasm english is such an easy language yet you do n't understand sarcasm ? 
  yeah , just go to poland . 
  they were occupied by germany and russia for over 50 years and everyone there speaks german and russian ... 
   religious conservatism out of curiosity : do you have lutheran conservatives ? 
  depends on . 
  do you have a katana and wakizashi ? 
   edit : i 'm not entirely convinced by the last sentence about fate , though . 
  the free men gathered at a thing and elected the warrior to lead them ( * herzog * in modern german ) . 
  they put their fate in his hand and became his fellowship . 
  according to https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oorlog#dutch * from middle dutch orloge , from old dutch * urlage . 
  in this word , two germanic words merged , both having the prefix ur - ( modern dutch oor and oer , with the former kept in compounds like oorzaak ( `` cause , driver '' ) and oorsprong ( `` origin '' ) , and the latter borrowed from german ) . 
  the first word was derived from proto-germanic * uzlag\u0105 meaning `` fate , destiny '' , with * laga - related to modern dutch leggen ( `` to lay '' ) . 
  the second word was derived from proto-germanic * uzleug\u014d meaning `` war '' , with * leug - meaning `` oath '' . 
  * iirc from history lessons , germanic tribes in ancient times required a thing to decide if they want to go to war , unless they were attacked and had to defend themselves . 
  arminius had to convince the other men and chieftains to follow him , thus creating a * fellowship * , electing him as * herzog * and the others swore to follow him . 
  the word herzog literally means : the one who leads the army , or walks in front of the heer . 
  one can still find that meaning in older german names like wernher oder hermann . 
   germany baby jesus . 
   one tradition is to put up a nicely-decorated crib . 
  each day mary and joseph approach the crib a little more . 
  finally the baby jesus is put inside and the shepherds come to visit . 
   i wonder if cars etc will be made which are able to make use of galileo ? 
  research is already going on , there is a galileo test field at my university/fhg : http://www.iff.fraunhofer.de/en/laboratories/galileo-test-bed.html http://www.galileo.ovgu.de/, 
  ask anton adriaan mussert where they are . 
   naked sauna-goers how else is one supposed to go to a sauna ? 
  read * the handkerchief * by akutagawa ry\u016bnosuke , it pretty much explains it . 
  japanese has fewer syllables than german , so it would be : orudunungu just like baito ( arubaito , arbeit ), 
   german politicians and industrialists to have cheap labor the german industry does not rely on cheap labour simply because labour in germany is expensive due to social benefits ( health insurance , pensions etc. ), 
  and strict firing rules . 
   and snatch back production from east europe production in germany relies on highly skilled labour . 
  we are not producing cheap plastic dolls , we produce high technology . 
   why not make their continued participation a requirement for their continued refugee status ? 
  why should a training company want and pay a trainee who does not want to be there ? 
   in certain fields you recognize people reviewing your paper just by how they write . 
  and other fields are simply too small to have an effective number of experts . 
  you know each other and one hand washes another . 
  i am the editor of an [ open access journal on security research ] ( http://www.sicherheitsforschung-magdeburg.de/publikationen/journal.html#c342 ) we founded 6 years ago . 
  producing that journal costs money , we have to pay for the domain and webspace ( cheap , but still costs money ) , the issn and some professional logos . 
  however , the most costly part is the conversion of the submissions into our latex style , which can be very time consuming , the proofreading and corrections are n't done in an hour and we also have to spent time on cheap advertising , to get more impact . 
  the books we produced were also payed by us ( isbn , printing , mandatory books for the national library , specimen copies for the authors and such ) . 
  we were in negotiation with some big publishing houses , they usually wanted us to do all the work ( provide a ready to print pdf with all the layout etc. 
  already done ) * and * pay additionally 5000-10000 $ just to get the book printed . 
  that 's when we decided to publish it on our own . 
  and some people are criticising us for not publishing with a known publishing house , because they have higher quality standards and bigger impacts . 
  i 'll tell you something : they do n't . 
  they rip you off and offered no quality assurance or copyediting . 
  they wanted us to do the work and pay for the whole process . 
  and you ca n't even flood them , since the children would drown in the belgian cellars . 
  if they are still alive ... 
  blaine is a pain , and that is the truth . 
  never been to mallorca , eh ?
