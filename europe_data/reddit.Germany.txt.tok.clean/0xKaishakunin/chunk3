  there is one huge political think tank in germany which is government funded and heavily interwoven with the bundeswehr : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_institute_for_international_and_security_affairs there is also the scientific service of the bundestag doing research . 
   but also back political parties ? 
  at least in germany we have foundations that are closely tied to political parties , eg konrad-adenauer-stiftung and cdu , rosa-luxemburg-stiftung and die linke etc. 
  the work as think tanks for their parties and do reserach like surveys or produce papers like industry 4.0 and the future of labour etc. 
  but they also offer free workshops and talks . 
  i teach a workshop on digital self defense , anonymity and surveillance for journalists , which is almost completely finance by one of the political foundations . 
  most of the money for those political foundations comes from the federal governments and also work abroad , eg . 
  in russia . 
  you need the basements in austria for something else , eh ?

   during the revolution , the communist coat of arms was cut off by the people . 
  we did the same in east germany , with the additional connotation of black-red-gold also being the west german flag . 
  but it 's not used anymore . 
  the crossword puzzle case . 
  in 1981 a suitcase with the dead body of a 7 year old raped boy was found at the railroad tracks close to halle-neustadt . 
  the suitcase did not lead to any clue , so there was only one hope left . 
  the suitcase was stuffed with old newspapers were a woman filled out the crossword puzzles . 
  police suspected her to be an accomplice or relative of the offender . 
  so the police started to gather specimens of handwriting of all inhabitants of halle-neustadt , which had a population of 91000 in 1981 . 
  after 9 month no further clue was found , so the police and a newspaper set up another crossword to gather more specimens . 
  still no hit . 
  after 10 month , inhabitants of halle-neustadt who worked in other towns were asked to send in a specimen and there was a hit . 
  the woman who filled out the crossword worked as a waitress during the holiday season at the baltic coast . 
  the boyfriend of her daughter was arrested and confessed on the spot . 
  exactly 551198 specimens were checked - manually , by police men with magnifiers . 
  it was turned into an episode of the famous east german crime show polizeiruf 110 , which depicts the work quite well .

  it 's not as great as 1 & 2 :-(, 
  maybe , but any self report is very , very subjective . 
  happyness is a construct and as such can not be measured directly . 
  so everything depends on how the scientists make it measurable , the so called operationalisation . 
  the easiest way would be to ask randomly selected people if they are happy and to report their happiness on a likert scale . 
  but then every subject had to operationalise their definition of happiness , making the comparison almost impossible . 
  if you had asked my grandparents this question , they would never ever admit to be happy , because that 's a sin for prussian lutherans . 
  despite the fact they may be happy . 
  that 's typical for my part of germany , we love to complain when we meet people , list all the things that are bad in this world and our diseases and then we have to reassure us that we will have to survive in this cold hard world because we have to . 
  that 's pretty different from some other parts of germany , like cologne and the rhineland . 
  another operationalisation might be smiling on photos . 
  us-americans tend to grin like horror clowns on photos while russians ( and other societies probably too ) do n't do that . 
  so counting how many people smile on american vs. russian photos would lead to the conclusion that russians are always unhappy and americans are always happy . 
  vice versa russian scientists might consider americans to be high on drugs or creepy . 
  it 's self reported and depends a lot on cultural constraints . 
  no , the highest cost would be the mandatory health insurance and the opportunity cost of not being employed . 
  being an entrepreneur is more expensive in germany than in the us , so there are less of it . 
  well , i prefer the german version of vorspiel and nachspiel .

  is n't the waldviertel also pretty poor ? 
  there are 3200 different kinds of bread in the deutsches brotregister . 
   in my experience i would n't say the german corps members have been particularly racist ( especially antisemitic ) , there different corps and corps unions as umbrella organisations in germany . 
  some are pretty liberal like the s\u00e4ngerschaften and others are pretty much right wing . 
  there was a debate going on in the so called deutsche burschenschaft in 2011 if students with foreign parents can become members . 
  this goes back to the 19th/early 20th century , when it was debated if jews could become members and own jewish corps/corp organisations were founded . 
   i have to say though , sliding feet seems like a pretty interesting way to applaud  sliding your feets actually means you disagree in german universities . 
  the german black-red-gold was used as colours of the urburschenschaft and made popular by them .
