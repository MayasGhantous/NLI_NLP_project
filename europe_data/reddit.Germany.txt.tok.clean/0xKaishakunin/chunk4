  gothic 1 , 2 + dndr empire earth 1, 
   moreover , there were no hatred even in the ussr times as east germany was in the soviet block and propaganda praised international friendship ( one of the cornershones of soviet ideology ) . 
  yeah , that was strange in east germany . 
  we had sometimes soviet soldiers visiting our schools but had no real contact with them . 
  and they were usually not allowed to walk around freely , so there was no real contact between the soldiers and the population outside of those forced settings like 1st may celebrations etc. 
  olsenbande is pretty much shown every summer . 
  there are old bunkers around . 
  one building i lived in was built in the 1960s and had a bunker in the basement , as it was required by building codes at that time . 
  there are also parts of the old mittelbau dora bunkers nearby , which were used for the production of v2 . 
   to add to that , i think the death threats and abuse the doctors have received are despicable . 
  those idiots should be sent out with emergency doctors when there is a major catastrophic event . 
  and then organise a triage . 
   ordnungsbussenverordnung how many seats do your ordnungsbusse have ? 
  not about how they can look , but so called * anscheinswaffen * - guns that look realistic - are not allowed to be carried . 
  some years ago a train station was locked down because an idiot played around with a softair pistol . 
  schoolshootings . 
  heavily romanticised in germany due to the books of karl may , where he pictured them as noble wilds . 
  you only have a chance to date a blonde woman if you are at least a minor freisian kaiser . 
  house shoes . 
  it 's a profession and therefor one of the top 50 names . 
  the ss was multicultural . 
  so multicultural that the flemish and wallonian ss fought each other at the end of the war and had to be stopped by the german ss . 
  what did you serve for his funeral feast ? 
  my mom works in it since the early 1970s . 
  in the 80s she was one of the operators of a soviet built ibm mainframe clone . 
  they had to clean the magnetic tape heads weekly with pure alcohol . 
  they usually did it in the backshift on a friday and brought a crate of cola with them . 
  unfortunately someone realised that they also could use denatured alcohol , so the party ended that day . 
   eau-de-vie water of life ? 
   i wonder if `` eastern european hellhole '' actually exists somewhere in europe have you ever seen reports about the romanian orphanages in the early 1990s ? 
  those were definitely hell holes . 
  they probably do n't know much about german history either . 
  every spring , when the snow melts , we find the still frozen dead bodies of tourists in berlin . 
  they died of starvation on a sunday . 
  some countries pour some sugar ( or hfcs ) on the already very sweet cakes . 
  just stay in line , do n't show deviant behaviour and turn almost invisible . 
  you might earn a small nod of acknowledgement . 
  and the lack of water pressure . 
  big mug of coffee , 3 slices of grey bread with butter and leberk\u00e4se . 
  and another mug of coffee . 
  one of them lives in germany , iirc . 
  except for that motherfucking gangbanging thug that never seen it comin ' . 
  falco . 
  uno-city is quite interesting and imo worth a visit when in vienna . 
  unless you are used to such large glass/steel buildings . 
  did they put sauerkraut on it ? 
  do you think op can differentiate between hefeweizen and tea ? 
   eastern german abomination that 's no fucking j\u00e4gerschnitzel . 
   hefeweizen you sure about that ?

  [ omelett ] ( https://fitundgluecklich.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/omelett-2.jpg ) still not as good as a bauernfr\u00fchst\u00fcck . 
  no , eierkuchen : http://www.gomeal.de/uploaded_img/eierkuchen.jpg, 
   pancake you mean eierkuchen . 
  and do n't get started on br\u00f6tchen . 
   switzerland the swiss flag is a big plus . 
   germany 's actual law is a little patchy , thanks to see-sawing students from eu countries have to be treated like native students . 
  besides that , you still have to have the required hochschulzugangsberechtigung . 
  check out the wiki at / r/germany https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/studying#green, 
  americans are n't used to diversity and ca n't handle it . 
  but it has probably to do with the occupation zones after ww2 . 
  bavaria was us occupied , so the soldiers only saw bavaria and thought all of germany is like that . 
  i am certified german on both sides , so no need for a dna test . 
  just watch this ad : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j5n8kzpbcs,

  well , we do have the [ abrafaxe ] ( https://www.ppm-vertrieb.de/images/news/images/40-jahre-mosaik-bild-1-xl.jpg ) who exist since 1976 and are the world 's longest running sequel comic . 
  at least according to the guinness book and their definition . 
  and before them , there were the [ digedags ] ( http://www.digedags-shop.de/webroot/store16/shops/61484047/4784/03b2/2a3a/23f1/0d18/c0a8/28b9/a443/978-3-7302-1881-5_275x400.jpg ) running from 1955-1975 . 
  and wilhelm busch pretty much invented modern * bilderpossen * in germany . 
  i wish we could invent superheroes like \u00dcbermensch or thor and loki in europe ^ / s,

  bang boom bang . 
  the whole cornetto trilogy was . 
  it is the abbreviation of the founders names ( hennes & mauritz ) . 
  it 's just called the other way because they sell only clothes for women who have the body of a 8 year old chinese boy . 
  it 's h&m . also often called hager & mager in german which means haggard & meagre . 
  do you speak austrian with the kangaroos ? 
  they also lack good beer . 
  some newer hotels have ac , but the older hotels , houses and flats do n't . 
  in some parts of the country they call gehacktes mett and br\u00f6tchen semmel . 
  the cultural diversity is strong in germany . 
  everyear , several south germans starve to death in northern germany because they ca n't communicate . 
  their name and manifesto . 
  [ die fahne von kriwoj rog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_banner_of_krivoi_rog ) and [ nackt unter w\u00f6lfen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naked_among_wolves_ ( 1963_film \\ ) ) . 
  [ jakob der l\u00fcgner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacob_the_liar_ ( 1975_film \\ ) ) is also pretty great . 
  besides goethe , schiller and lessing we had wilhelm raabe ( for regional reasons ) and heinrich heine , as he was the namesake of our school . 
   goetterfunken while goethe is amazing , the g\u00f6tterfunken are from a military doctor called schiller . 
  also * nathan der weise * for obvious reasons . 
  only happy when i can complain . 
   she said `` this has nothing to do with muricanisation , it 's a good opportunity for kids to get dressed in costumes that they made themselves and get rewarded for it ( with candy ) . 
  do n't bash it just because it 's american '' . 
  to be honest , i was stumped , she was right 100 % . 
  but that 's bullshit .
