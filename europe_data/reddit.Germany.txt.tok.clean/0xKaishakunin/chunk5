  if you want to dress up as a child and sing for candy do it on 6th january . 
  it 's sternsingen and has been a tradition for several centuries . 
  so stop making halloween happen , 31st october is reformationstag . 
   education in germany is open to anyone who has a recognised degree to enter university . 
   but i do n't like how people literally kill themselves at work and how oppressive it feels . 
  the school and university system is n't great either . 
  the perception of women ( office ladys etc. ), 
  is also a bit outdated . 
   yeah , but today is sunday ...  but this will bring in additional $ . 
  holiday premium . 
  maybe i shoul visit the blue \u00d6yster bar more often . 
  so a k\u00e4ltepumpe in reverse ? 
   gypsies like peter maffay ? 
  was asked why i do n't wear lederhosen . 
  w\u00e4rmepumpe in german , but i assume that 's a different concept . 
  sparwasser . 
  also the only name i know . 
  that light draught when you * kipp * the windows to * l\u00fcft *, 
  like a jammed machinegun mg42 . 
  the original one , but it was n't on # 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkrbs46y3js, 
  what about the m\u00e4rzrevolution of 1848 ? 
  depending on your definition of german we had almost none or a lot . 
  and they have [ fancy uniforms ] ( https://images.kurier.at/filmtipps_-005_bruno%2bbueno%2bzdf.jpg/620x930nocrop/416.780 ), 
  the modern orthography was standardised in the late 19th century by konrad duden . 
  his orthographic dictionary is nowadays called * duden * and basically * the * authority with regards to orthography and relevance of a word . 
  this has historical reasons . 
  if the word enters the duden , it 's not just a fad . 
  * googeln * ( to google ) was added in 2004 . 
  legally , the ministries of the federal states have the legislative power to set orthographic rules . 
  they used it back in the 1990s when the introduced new rules in 1996 . 
  technically , every federal state could create it 's own orthography , but this wo n't happen . 
  no one has the intention to be intentional . 
  15th june 1961 . 
  i use a moulinette . 
  i love carrot juice , but the prepacked usually has to much sugar in it , so i make it fresh . 
   schumacher which one ? 
  the rasseamt forbids this . 
  do you make your own juice with a moulinette ? 
   coffee and cigarettes . 
  in this order ( according to infratest dimap ) * fireman * nurse * physician * kinderg\u00e4rtner * police * commercial pilot * judges * dustmen * university professor * teacher, 
   the more interesting question is here , if e.g. 
  the difference between baviara and austria is comparable to difference between bavaria and e.g. 
  berlin , which is harder to answer . 
  it simply relies on how you operationalise culture . 
  diddl-maus was so popular in the mid-90s . 
   kelly family ... oh dear god , those fan girls . 
  to be announced ? 
   dynamo was for police/army in east germany . 
  bfc dynamo berlin was the stasi club and the most hated one . 
  are there many [ rape fields ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rj9nkxfyaq4/maxresdefault.jpg ) in cologne ? 
   pittsburgh steelers those are real names : * turbine potsdam * stahl blankenburg * lokomotive blankenburg * motor halle * dynamo dresden * traktor sandersleben and my favourite name : * \u0424\u041a \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0440\u0433 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044c\u043a, 
  besides goulash , the story of [ ignaz semmelweis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ignaz_semmelweis ), 
  absolutely , got a new one last year in my new flat . 
  my father was a plumber until a year ago and also installed more flachsp\u00fcler than tiefsp\u00fcler . 
  especially hospitals , medical centers , retirement homes etc. 
  need them . 
   these are the old ones there are a lot of new flachsp\u00fcler . 
  there is also lutherstadt eisleben . 
  and there was wilhelm-pieck-stadt guben . 
  those rankings are bullshit , as they already fail at the operationalisation of university performance . 
  * call the midwife * empire * community * frasier ( again and again ), 
   that 's an interesting question , it was broadcast on rtl , which is not famous for quality tv . 
   maybe it 's because the topic is n't anything groundbreakingly `` exotic '' my dad did n't want to watch it either : `` i do n't want to see nva bullshit again . '', 
  unassisted childbirth is allowed in germany , but almost not done for liability reasons of the mother . 
  so most births are assisted by a midwife either at home or in a hospital . 
  i think the system in de and at are pretty similar for historical reasons . 
  however , the mandatory third party insurance for midwives are skyrocketing and freelancing midwives are under very heavy financial pressure . 
  is this new ? 
  did n't have to pay back in 2014 . 
  the last unplanned power loss was in 2007 , during the cyclone kyrill . 
  this argument shows up all the time since the first crypto wars in the 1990s . 
  it only shows that most politicians have no single fucking clue about how the net works and how terrorists communicate . 
  duncan campbell did a great talk at deepsec 2011 about how terrorists encrypt . 
  it was quite interesting to see that terrorists are either to stupid to do proper encryption or do not care . 
  you can find a video of his talk online at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idotfzdm4f0 and let 's not forget that the uk already has a lot of surveillance going on , yet they failed to prevent the last attacks . 
   holland vs. netherlands intensifies the ** nederlandse ** zuivel organisatie developed a marketing slogan in germany where they spoke about cheese from ** [ holland ] ( http://www.frauantje.de/fileadmin/timeline/antje_historie13.jpg ) **, 
  mostly everything with an umlaut that does n't have an english name already ( n\u00fcrnberg / nuremberg ) . 
  burg and berg is often confused in english , but b\u00fcrger do n't live in a berg . 
  english speakers also have a problem with ei/ie , so wiener often becomes weiner . 
  metalab and irs . 
   nachmittag if you like to watch ard and zdf there also is vorabend  abend, 
   matt-eagle oh ja . 
   `` g\u00f6nnhart '' was the clear winner was n't it even g\u00f6nnhart gibdir ? 
  the danish olsen-bande is very popular in east germany and afaik also in the nordic countries and some former comecon countries . 
   great names for using `` the voice ''  especially with * fr\u00e4ulein !, 
  *  how about luise henriette ? 
  i like luise but henriette is tainted by a former teacher . 
  it was not only prussia , 18 members states of the confederation were involved . 
   the three years war was against prussia that was the german confederation ( deutscher bund ) . 
   but during the 3 years war against prussia , prussia and austria . 
  anyway , i do n't own a german flag and it does n't play a big role in everydays life . 
  had to hoist it during flag parade in the army , though . 
  i do have a [ flag of my hometown ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/flagge_blankenburg_%28harz%29.svg/2000px-flagge_blankenburg_%28harz%29.svg.png ) hanging in my office . 
  flying the german flag was pretty uncommon before the football championship in 2006 . 
  nowadays you can see them everywhere during international football tournaments . 
  they would be allowed , but i have absolutely no idea of boy 's names . 
  charlotte friederike , sophie amalia and katharina elisabeth . 
  and your daughter shakira . 
  hips be upon her . 
  have you looked into leonardo ?
