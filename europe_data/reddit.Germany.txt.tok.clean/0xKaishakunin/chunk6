   but nobody is actually getting their hands dirty and actually getting out . 
  no , we would take over hell and make it much more effective . 
  and teach the unorganised imps to be better guards . 
  it 's actually a direct quote from a teacher who took part in a survey about names of pupils . 
  it 's not a name , it 's a diagnosis . 
  but do you have access to [ american imitation pasteurized process cheese food ? 
  ] ( http://estebanpulidophotography.com/amcheesedocu/amcheesedocu_files/shapeimage_3.jpg ), 
   it is a danish concept we also have * volkshochschulen * in germany , though the concept differs from the scandinavian model . 
  it was more influenced by social democracy and widening participation for the working class . 
  courses are usually taught in the evening and full time courses often only take one week . 
  i taught it security at our local volkshochschule , which was quite interesting .

   also , i think cyrillic alphabet is much prettier in cursive , just imho . 
  i hated proofreading texts from female fellow pupils in russian . 
  so many curls ... 
  you could write every russian word with the czech alphabet . 
  it 's used in the scientific transliteration of russian . 
  however , has there ever been a serious discussion about dropping cyrillic ? 
  russian has it 's own keyboard layout , like french , german or spanish too . 
  you get used to it . 
  there are also layouts where the cyrillic letters are sort according to the german layout . 
  the younger slavists often used a layout like [ this ] ( http://russisch.urz.uni-leipzig.de/keyonscr.gif ) while the older ones stuck to the [ russian typewriter layout ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/kb_russian.svg/2000px-kb_russian.svg.png ), 
   if you count a rifle that does n't like getting hot as a solid tool ... no assault rifle keeps it accuracy when it get 's hot , especially after firing several magazines in auto . 
  neither the g3 , ak74 or m16 can do this . 
  the g36 was designed and ordered as an assault rifle , and that 's what hk delivered . 
  the politicians decided to * not * buy the lmg version of the g36 with a stronger barrel and drum magazines because they wanted to save money . 
   most pre-school children can understand the latin alphabet for the most part .

  sorbian : both upper and lower sorbian are dying out , though the university of leipzig tries to conserve the languages since the 1950s . 
  there are school lessons taught in sorbian in saxony and brandenburg and some radio and tv shows in both languages available . 
  you can still see remains of those and other slavic dialects in toponyms ( berlin - br ' lo , connewitz , wachwitz ),

  you are also only allowed to work 120 full days and getting a job without speaking german might be really difficult . 
  and you have to make sure your high school degree is worth something : http://anabin.kmk.org/anabin.html, 
  to make the vampires drunk ? 
   wow . 
  thank you for that explanation . 
  so only if one of the words in the new compound word already has \u00df will it be used , otherwise not ? 
  like in fu\u00dfball ? 
  yes , i ca n't think of an example for a new word using \u00df , except for being fancy or old fashioned , like * ye olde * in english . 
   also , why is it capital letter when not used at the start of the word ? 
  ligatures have never been used as capital letters , since they were never used at the beginning of words . 
  the same happened with umlaute , in books printed before ww2 capital umlaute did not exist , instead they used ue , oe or ae like * ueberraschung * . 
  capital umlaute were introduced later . 
  the lack of a capital \u00df was problematic in family names , when they were printed completely in upper case letters . 
  normal words would swap the \u00df into an ss , but that 's a bit problematic with family names like * s\u00fc\u00df * , since * s\u00dcss * could be both , * s\u00fcss * or * s\u00fc\u00df * . 
  we actually had that problem in the army , as nametags are only uppercase . 
  but i assume \u00df will die out , the guys who organised the spelling reform in the 1990s did not understand why \u00df exists and how it works in fraktur texts .
