  other ligatures like st or ck/kk also do n't exist anymore . 
  btw : here is a nice example of a fraktur text with umlaute still indicated by a small e above them and antigua used for other languages : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/kantwasistaufkl%c3%a4rung.png, 
  \u00df is a ligature , not a letter . 
  a capital \u00df did not exist until some years ago . 
  ligatures were popular in fraktur fonts and also existed in other languages like english . 
  other ligatures became promoted to actual letters , like w ( double u ) or a logogram , like @ or & . 
  a \u00df actually modifies the pronunciation of the word in modern german and after the orthographic reform in the 1990s , * dass * sounds different from * da\u00df * . 
  that 's also why * ru\u00dfland * was changed to * russland * , to be more coherent . 
   if new words enter german , will they ever be spelled with \u00df ? 
  compounds yes , like * fu\u00dfballneusch\u00f6pfungsbeispiel * , but loanwords probably not , as \u00df does not exist in other languages . 
  i assume it will die out , switzerland already removed the \u00df from their official german . 
  really drinking at age 13 . 
    do you think your country is `` great '' ?

  s\u00e4me in german , we basically use either jr. / sr.

  only case of vater/sohn i know is johann strauss , but that might be influenced by austrian german . 
  philipp reis , he also invented the term telephon . 
  in school , at university , by immersion . 
  where do i get permit a38 ? 
  though people have been misusing it lately , we should update the humorkennzeichnungsrichtlinie . 
  but their punchlines blow up more . 
  so much the austrians have to hide their children in their basements . 
  not true , we have nationally designated humour zones were you are required to be funny by wearing a [ funny hat or nose ] ( http://www.koeln.de/files/slides/11-11-altstadt-fjr-06_565.jpg ) . 
  chicken run, 
  the ss was highly criminal though , a lot of embezzlement happened in concentration camps . 
  as sung by my oma . 
  indeed . 
  russian is full of them , many military terms are german loanwords , mostly introduced by baltic-germans and german settlers katharina invited . 
  japanese also imported some german loanwords when it invited prussia to help modernisation , especiall in the medical fields . 
  - \u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8 from arbeit meaning job - \u30ea\u30e5\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30c3\u30af rucksack ( again ) - \u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30b1 kranker ( sufferer ) - \u30ea\u30e5\u30c3\u30af\u30b5\u30c3\u30af karte ( medical file , from krankenkarte ), 
  what harvest ? 
   because ~ 65 % of the women i have spoken to , concerning this subject , are super pro mandatory military service as long as they do n't have to do it . 
  because they might get babies in the future . 
  which is neither guaranteed to happen nor mandatory . 
  we had ancient words for it onkel/tante or base for brothers and sisters of your father and muhme/oheim for sister and brother of your mother .

  merseburger zauberspr\u00fcche , two charms written in old high german in the 9th or 10th century . 
  pretty much , almost all drivers are usually rettungssanit\u00e4ter . 
  they either have a notarzt or notfallsanit\u00e4ter as passenger on board . 
  i do n't know much about paramedics , but the notfallsanit\u00e4ter has much better training in medical stuff and is allowed to do more . 
   if i 'm not mistaken , you need ausbildung ( it 's kind of like learning a trade ) of 3 years in the field to be able to apply for these positions , including : nope , rettungssanit\u00e4ter can be learnt in 4 month fulltime . 
  the notfallsanit\u00e4ter ( next level with far more competences ) requires a 3 year training including theoretical and practical training in a hospital and an emergency service . 
  the notfallsanit\u00e4ter is pretty new in germany and was introduced to harmonise the european standards . 
  i did n't fully understand it until i had a d\u00f6ner in the uk . 
  it was totally bland . 
  british food and british women . 
  so a nation of sailors was born .

  there is a strange video by dw about pommerode : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ymiwpay-a0, 
  there are also the siebenb\u00fcrger sachsen in nowadays romania . 
  she was * the * german pornstar at her time . 
  you mean * junge fotzen hart gedehnt * and other classics ? 
  she played in some movies and series as schaffrath : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/michaela_schaffrath#als_michaela_schaffrath,

   thanks to the enschede treaty the dutch and german police cooperate very well . 
  they also cooperate on the german/polish and german/czech border and border area .

  the taxi ride from moscow domodedowo to my hotel via lubyanskaya ploshchad .

  my hotel was between some kind of huge military office and some oil/gas companies hq , so you would see a lot of those guys dressed in black , walking german shepherd dogs and driving mercedes benz g. 
   h\u00e4nschen klein - ignore the strange video ... but i di n't want the new childversion seems to be the steiner version .

  no , first of all , look up my explanation at the start of the thread . 
  what graf_icky wrote is bullshit . 
  solidarit\u00e4tszuschlag was n't introduced to help the east but to finance the gulf war the us started in 1990 . 
  however , the east german industry was effectively killed off by the treuhand , selling them to their west german competitors .
