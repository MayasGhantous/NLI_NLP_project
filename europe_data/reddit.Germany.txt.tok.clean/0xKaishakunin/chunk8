  sometimes also to foreign companies , like the corruption in the elf aquitaine/leuna affaire has shown . 
   ya excuse me , but it 's been almost 30 years since the wall came down . 
  everybody in today 's germany , who still blames it on east-west , might be a bit delusional to me , cheers of course . 
  not knowing what 's going on , but having a strong opinion on it . 
  are you a pegida leader ? 
  you are the perfect example for it :-), 
   calm your titties , opa / u/graf _ lcky stay classy :-), 
  wo n't happen , the east german economy was severely destroyed by west german treuhand . 
   but i 'm just a west german , so i do n't have the ability to tell you exactly when the east is going to be great again . 
  this is typical west german behaviour . 
  no fucking clue what 's going on , but playing an expert . 
   there is , the west citizens still pay 1.8 % 5.5 % of their income to the eastern states , called solidarit\u00e4tszuschlag . 
  addit : could n't find an english wiki page : it 's a complex inter state wealth transfer regulation law . 
  citizens of the former west german states pay this tax , which is then allocated to the former east german states , today to some other poor areas in the west too . 
  that 's some trump-level bullshit you are writing . 
  * soli is paid by all that make more than 1.444 $ / month ( steuerklasse i ) or 2.726 $ / month ( steuerklasse iii ) , regardless of west or east german * the soli is not transferred to the eastern states , it was not even introduce to support the eastern states . 
  it was introduced to finance the fucking gulf war of 1990/91 . 
  cf bt ds 12/220 , 11 . 
  m\u00e4rz 1991 * the l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich was introduced already in 1955, 
  it 's a typical german tv movie with some famous actors in it . 
  not dark enough for my taste . 
  there is also a version from 1966 which is even cheesier . 
  terence hill plays giselher :-d i really loved the books on germanic mythology when i was a child . 
  in the end , everything crumbles down and everyone dies in the worst way possible . 
   and there 's a super bureaucrat who can control smoke . 
  must be of prussian heritage then . 
   i hope you are aware that thor and loki are european , they 're norse gods ? 
  what do you think does * donnerstag * mean ? 
   that said , i 'd love to see the myths on european big screen . 
  there have been some attempts eg . 
  at the nibelungenlied https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_kingdom:_the_dragon_king, 
  what 's there superpower ? 
  drinking moonshine obstler without going blind ? 
   eh , i personally find superheroes ridiculous and unbeilevable as fuck i would love to see a european version of american superheroes like thor and loki . 
  maybe we can also make up some stories about them . 
  b\u00e4rlauch is great . 
  smells so good when you walk through the forrest and there is a huge b\u00e4rlauch field in it . 
  why the fuck should i get traumatised from preparing a meal ? 
  my parents still have a photo of me when i was 4 and ran to the bathroom to give the carp kisses . 
  he lived for some days in our bathtub , before ending as christmas dinner . 
  a us delicacy . 
  maybe you can find a nice irish from boston on reddit who brings you one . 
  https://bookshop.europa.eu/en/home/ you can get free ebooks and printed books from the eu , about the eu . 
   50 years . 
  that would have been 1967 . 
  do you know were adolf went to ? 
  washington ? 
  south america ? 
  dark side of the moon ? 
  that 's when the children dress up and go from house to house to collect free snickers ? 
   i though the wachbataillon abandoned bonn a while ago . 
  i ca n't find any reference to bonn , neither in the wikipedia article nor in the official site . 
  you are right . 
  one company ( iirc 7 . / - ) was stationed in bonn to guard the hardth\u00f6he , but they moved to berlin in 2014 . 
  i have n't been to the julius-leber-kaserne since , so i did n't notice . 
   stationed in berlin and bonn . 
   by the guards regiments in the gdr it was only guarded by wachregiment 1 ( friedrich engels ) , which exclusively did protocollar duty . 
  wr hugo eberlein did the actual guarding and feliks dzierzynski was mfs .

  oh dear , i remember that scientology propaganda in the mid 1990s . 
  they tried to liken their treatment of not being recognised as a curch to the treatment of jews and other religious groups by the nazis . 
  including some hollywood actors like tom cruise , who * had * to play stauffenberg and was not well received for this in germany . 
  however , in this context i assume they are referring to violence against refugees in east germany . 
  but most of them were n't refugees , but workers sent here by there socialist governments in vietnam , cuba , mosambique etc. 
  to get a training in the gdr and to work here . 
  there were n't much immigrants coming to germany , at least compared to today . 
  there were , however , lots of turkish guest workers living in western germany as well as spaniards , greeks and italians . 
  in east germany were a lot of guest workers from vietnam , cuba and african states . 
  and the return and integration of russia-germans was another debate . 
  kohl was more into chequebook diplomacy , germany was throwing a lot of money at the un and nato to avoid getting involved in the iraq/kuwait conflict and to help the civillians affected by it . 
   thanks a lot , yeah i 'm going to visit the canadian embassy in canada to renew my passport in july . 
  you do n't have to go to the canadian embassy in canada . 
  i do n't think there even exists one . 
  go to the canadian embassy close to you , which should be in berlin . 
  google their phone number and call them asap about your passport and visa . 
  going there in july might be a bit late . 
  it could take some weeks to get a new passport . 
  can you post a link to that article ? 
  would like to see the context . 
   there were a number of parallels to today 's situation , including rightwing parties rising up , and people claiming `` foreigners '' would bring about the end of the occident . 
  one should not forget that the cdu was interested in returning sp\u00e4taussiedler ( wolga germans and other germans living in eastern europe , like siebenb\u00fcrger sachsen in romania ) , as they considered them to be religious and conservative , so they would be the perfect cdu voters . 
  there was also a huge debate about the perceived `` quality '' of immigrants and refugees and the debate about dual citizenship for the turkish guestworkers . 
  some years ago someone wrote a dr-thesis about why the olsenbande is so popular in east germany and virtually unknown in west germany . 
   also : olsen banden was shown in germany ? 
  is franz j\u00e4ger from berlin ? 
  they are very popular in east germany . 
  so popular that the public east german tv station mdr co-produced the last movie . 
  i could scratch you with my z\u00fcndnadelgewehr ...

  sauerkraut is a very ancient way to conserve cabbage . 
  which was vital to survive the winter in central and northern europe before you could buy pineapples in december in the next aldi or hop on a 20 $ flight to mallorca . 
  it is also vital when you spend month on the open sea and do n't want to die of scurvy . 
  lime juice is another great way to get vitamins , just ask the british sailors , who are called limeys for exactly this reason . 
  how many pineapples or bananas did your great-great-grandparents eat in their life ? 
  edit : sauerkraut and pineapple goes well , there are some recipes in german : http://www.chefkoch.de/rs/s0/ananas+sauerkraut/rezepte.html, 
   i 'm swedish and i 've survived 30 winters longer , darker and colder than yours it 's great when you can buy pineapples and bananas all year long , is n't it ?
