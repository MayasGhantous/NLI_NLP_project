   snout of the pig , the feet of a pig , or the tail , or ears make foreigners uncomfortable , but it is n't that bad . 
  but they were/are pretty common throughout the world . 
  you can not throw away that precious meat . 
  we have delicious [ s\u00fclze ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/s%c3%bclze001.jpg/1200px-s%c3%bclze001.jpg ) made from pig 's head in germany . 
  intestines have also been eaten , but are considered to be a taboo nowadays . 
   but ... sauerkraut ? 
  how do you want to survive a long , dark and cold winter without vitamins ? 
  or a long maritime journey , for that matter . 
  poland has a much higher consumption of sauerkraut than germany . 
  the us and france also consume more of it than germans . 
  we have a nice statue of otto von guericke 's magdeburg hemispheres experiment . 
  it looks pretty [ normal from one side ] ( http://sg-md.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_8052.jpg ) but a [ bit special from the other side ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0b/b7/98/3b/blick-von-hinten.jpg ), 
  quite often on the autobahn , as a huge training ground is near by . 
  becker and frasier were broadcast some years ago after the late night show . 
  now i am to old to stay up that long and generally watch less tv . 
  i also read less books :-( i tried breaking bad and the sopranos , but they never really appealed to me . 
  i only turned on the tv in the last weeks to watch * das sacher * and * charit\u00e9 * , which is a german mini series . 
  it looks promising . 
  there are/were some great series i love to watch . 
  i really loved frasier , becker and community . 
  some channels rerun us series every day , mostly because it 's cheaper to dub successfull us series than to create own content . 
  smaller channels also rerun older stuff like mash , a-team , macgyver , airwolf and such . 
  it 's sometimes funny to see how they imagined east germany . 
  the volkspolizei using mercedes-benz and such . 
  everyday , my neighbours are vietnamese and my university has the unesco unevoc chair for se asia . 
  so we do a lot of projects with chinese , vietnamese , malaysians , indonesians etc. 
  plenty , many go to the herbergsmuseum , but they do n't come to me to ask for money . 
   pineapples on a currywurst-pizza ? 
  two times a year , when the chimney sweep comes for his routine check . 
   klopsiki mhmmm , [ klopse ] ( http://www.fettich.de/media/reviews/photos/original/70/85/73/img-3907-600x600-100kb-42-1391351673.jpg ), 
  his birthplace is n't known , but many assume it 's also aachen . 
  otto iii held several diets there and theophanu died there . 
  probably moved there before 1989 , as the \u010cssr had training agreements with vietnam . 
  vietnamese were send to the \u010cssr and studied there or got a training . 
  the same happened in east germany , that 's why the vietnamese are the largest groups of foreign born people here . 
  poland did the same , iirc . 
  both , though the new , more heavily armed units are usually on call and not patrolling . 
  however , the normal police men need better training , too . 
  they need more shooting training and better protective gear . 
   what i try to say : i do understand why the police is using heavier equipment right now , but i fear that it will lead to more machineguns in the hands of gangs . 
  i do n't think so . 
  gangs fight other gangs , not the police . 
  they can not stand against the mek/sek in germany , unless the gang itself is made up of special forces policemen or soldiers . 
  what we need are the bfe + units , which are not a specialised and heavily armed like the sek/mek , but better armed and trained than the normal policemen on the streets . 
  i doubt those old guy patrolling eg . 
  at airports like tegel could take down a terrorist that is prepared to harm as many people as possible and who want 's to die . 
  you can buy protective gear in army surplus shops and get an ak74su easily on the black market . 
  3 guys with some tactical training could easily overrun larger crowds . 
  so yes , we do need better trained and more heavily armed police men . 
  especially with sniper training . 
  but we also need more normal policemen on the streets patrolling , and they need better equipment and training . 
  something that has been done after we had some school shootings in germany . 
  yes , the system was modernised some years ago . 
  before that , we used a simple [ table ] ( https://www.dhm.de/fileadmin/medien/lemo/images/d2930437.jpg ), 
  you get assigned your favourite teams after you turn in an dna test to determine the percentage of your heritage . 
  spass-fakt : gift ( german for poison ) and give/gifted in english have the same root , begause it was given to someone . 
  no , we are the nazis , for banning their rallies in germany . 
  google translate , i ca n't even tell if it 's correct or not . 
   ruled by bureaucrats . 
   schakira your living to long in germany . 
  if anyone was able to do , it would be us . 
  you know , setting up all the logistics , the trains and camps and such . 
   anal sex are pretty good that 's the catholic boy speaking ? 
   would an american with a us degree have better opportunities in europe first you have to get a visa to work in germany and your us degree has to be recognised . 
  many of them are n't , as us unis are pretty mediocre . 
  if your master 's is good enough you could look for luft - und raumfahrttechnik . 
  but i doubt that the military stuff is done at universities , for nd reasons . 
  east german movies , but most people are n't able to understand them , as they had to encode difficult things . 
  the classics are * die legende von paul und paula * das kaninchen bin ich ( namesake of the * kaninchenfilme * , movies that were banned in east germany ) * spur der steine ( most famous of the forbidden movies . 
  a true legend . ), 
  * sieben sommersprossen * coming out * der lange ritt zur schule ( children 's movie , somewhat meta , but captures the feeling of it 's time quite well ) * einfach blumen aufs dach ( highly ironic if you had to deal with the nomenclatura . 
  not so funny for outsiders . 
  east german movies not about east germany : * die abenteuer des werner holt ( read by almost every pupil in schools ) * ich war 19 ( directed by and about the life of konrad wolf , one of the best directors and the brother of markus wolf , head of mfs hva ) * jakob der l\u00fcgner * nackt unter w\u00f6lfen ( author , director and some of the actors were imprisoned in concentration camps . 
  they knew how they worked . ), 
  * die fahne von kriwoi rog * das beil von wandsbek and interesting movie made in 2001 iirc was * berlin is in germany * ( yes , that 's the german title ) about a guy that got imprisoned in 1989 and is released into unified germany in 2001 . 
   das leben der anderen , good bye , lenin ! , sonnenalle : all movies about life in east germany a bunch of shitty movies about lige in east germany . 
   but i literally can not name one besides bavaria . 
  that seems to be a problem of your educational system . 
   when you see a map of your country , is it clearly divided into states germany is a federal republic , so every political map shows the 16 federal states . 
  never seen those here in germany . 
  nope , the abibas of jack wolfskin , an overpriced outdoor gear branch . 
  popular among philosophy teachers who have the survive the harsh conditions of walking 50m from the car park to the school . 
   no fucking way . .  she works in there ? 
   but very overpriced hey , they have very cheap jack wuffskin jackets available . 
  yes . 
   i do n't really see the problem , potential software developers ( or other high skills professions ) choose to go to university instead . 
   he threw an ox ( the last ? ), 
  an ox filled with rye or wheat iirc . 
  at least paul watzlawick said so . 
  75 % of the workforce has an apprenticeship . 
  a typical apprenticeship lasts 3 years , some only 2 years ( sales clerk ) and others 3.5 years ( car mechatronic ) . 
  trainees have to apply at a training company and get paid by them . 
  they usually work 3 days per week in their company and attend vocational school 2 days per week . 
  some smaller professions like glass blower or clock maker only have one vocational school in germany and they usually attend them in blocks . 
  the curricula for all professions are standardised throughout the german federal states and get revised every couple of years . 
  so every car mechatronic learns the same technical background in every tvet school in germany , no matter if he does his apprenticeship at porsche or a small garage in a small village . 
  every apprenticeship ends with an examination at the local chamber of commerce or trade . 
   is it good or being looked down ? 
  it 's not really looked down , but there certainly is a demographical change going on . 
  20 years ago there were much more school-leavers than apprenticeships and companies could choose .
