  if you have an issue understanding google , or even just clicking the link i offered to you , do you want me to copy & paste the first three pages of search results here ? 
  or would you like to give it another try if you can click them on the google search results page , which i linked , all by yourself ? 
  it is definitely not impossible for the german government to get the message of `` do n't try irregular migration to germany , you will only be deported back '' thoroughly and effectively across . 
  it is only inconvenient if you have deluded large parts of the electorate with a `` good samaritan '' comedy and do not want to pop this delusion , for cynical political power considerations . 
  well , now the political future of ms merkel looks dark anyway . 
  here is a google search for the terms `` merkel '' and `` invite '' . 
  516.000 hits . 
  it is you who is confusing causation and correlation , my friend . 
  the message that the merkel government considered `` the refugees '' ( the irregular migrants , a small number of which were refugees ) to be an economic blessing for germany , to magically solve all workforce challenges , all demographic challenges , was comprehensively carried by arab media and arab social media . 
  it caused even much more people to start the journey of irregular migration to germany . 
   i am especially annoyed by the assumption that merkel did anything because she ` wants refugees in germany ' . 
  nobody ` wants ' refugees . 
  there are zillions of statements from the merkel government that `` the refugees '' ( the irregular migrants , a small number of which were refugees ) would be an economic blessing for germany , would magically solve all workforce challenges , all demographic challenges . 
  you did not miss that , did you ? 
   merkel can not be blamed for that one . 
  it was merkel 's job to manage the overall situation . 
  where communication was misperceived , where media presented her government 's message different from what she intended to communicate , she had to effectively correct it . 
  the attempt to put the blame on the secretary will not work , my friend . 
  it simply will not work . 
  the point of communication is what reaches and is perceived by the receiving side . 
  and matter of fact is that in late summer of 2015 , around 500 million people in the middle east and north africa perceived the communication of ms merkel the way that she would invite everbody who wants to start a new life to germany . 
  a good insight are the tweets from pan-arab celebrity journalist jenan moussa ; here is just a selection of tweets of her from october 21 , 2015 . 
  ** this ** is reality . 
  https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/656789984058454016 https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/656790942884765696 https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/656791743086600196 https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/656792823908421632 https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/656794692521218048 my personal consequence from all this is that in every election in germany in the future , i will choose the party i vote for under the overriding consideration that i want to end the chancelorship of this ignorant , dilettant , amateurish and unprofessional person as soon as possible . 
  is this the same erdogan with whom my chancelor ms merkel wanted , upon his request , to open new chapters in an accession to the european union ? 
  the [ european charter of local self-government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_of_local_self-government ) is for everywhere and everybody . 
  one nice experience i had on reddit was a turkish nationalist who supported the idea of more local self-government in turkey and ranted blaming the kurds that only for the issues with them he could/would not advocate implementing it . 
  and yes , i do understand that in a system with local government in turkey , there will be people with a pkk background and many people with pkk sympathies in public positions and public power . 
  one more good reason to embrace the progressive kurdish movement in sincere exchange and discourse , rather than demonizing it . 
  if it were my city , i would prefer people with a pkk background in local police over people who are stuck in tribal-feudal kurdish past and dark age mindsets . 
  in any case , once the antagonism between the republic and the progressive kurdish movement is overcome , `` the pkk '' will be a completely different thing from today . 
  well ... [ bandiera rossa la trionfera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bao3-h0qtps ) ... 
   there 's kurdish education in schools no , there is no option in turkey for school instruction in kurdish language ( a basic element of autochthonous ethnic minority rights ) , and i am sure you know that . 
  just as the european charter for local self-government has not been implemented in turkey ( although it is under a legal obligation to do so ) . 
  these are the two most high profile grievances and complaints . 
  i would assume that you have a choice for what/whom , for `` what money '' you work . 
  the economic alternative for workers in the textile industry in countries like bangladesh or ethiopia is to do what all their ancestors did : subsistence farming outside of the money economy . 
  actually these jobs that pay so badly when compared to europe are progress there ( reminder : it went the same path once ago in europe and elsewhere ) , and in particular they constitute a historic step in a revolutionary empowerment of women in society there . 
  more than 50 percent of the sum in household electricity bills in germany are taxes , in particular to finance private luxury solar projects ( and industry outages , see below ) . 
  according to the measure of electricity bills as a share of income , people in germany now suffer from `` energy poverty '' like a third world country . 
  installed capacity is not a helpful measure if coal power generators need much time to start running once switched off . 
  germany has power outages like a third world country , until now only affecting the metal industry ( which does not complain loud because it is generously compensated , out of household electricity bills ) . 
  the vast majority of germans was in the grip of hysteria then . 
  polls suggested that up to 70 percent of germans were trembling of angst , fearing such ridiculously absurd scenarios like a tsunami in neckarwestheim . 
  other examples of hysteria in germany did not have such far-reaching consequences like legislation with a timetable for phasing out nuclear energy generation without a viable alternative ( not even to speak of an * affordable * alternative ; electricity is more and more becoming a luxury good in germany ) . 
  what was under attack in paris ? 
  the universal values of enlightenment and humanism and the universal concept of the open society . 
  what was under attack in ankara now ? 
  we do not know for sure , but most probably it was the policy of violently oppressing kurds and rejecting minority rights and local self-government ( even beyond the own borders ! ), 
  for the sake of ultra-nationalism and ultra-centralism . 
  this explains the difference in empathy , i guess . 
  the absurd hysteria of 2011 , within a day after the fukushima tsunami * geiger counter * were sold out in germany , in which that phaseout was legislated , is an utterly embarrassing episode for the german people . 
  already implementing the policy that anyone who disagrees with erdogan sultanism of violent arrogance and seeks or even just talks about peace is a `` terrorist '' , as for example this article [ british academic detained in turkey accused of ` making terrorist propaganda ' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/12194590/british-academic-detained-in-turkey-accused-of-making-terrorist-propaganda.html ) from today illustrates . 
  simple answer , i only link texts which i consider `` excellent '' or at least `` readworthy '' . 
  this one is excellent . 
  there is an excellent , comprehensive german language article `` im bett mit dem sultan '' ( `` in bed with the sultan '' ) on ms merkel 's schemes and dealings with the erdogan regime in turkey : http://www.welt.de/print/wams/politik/article153229841/im-bett-mit-dem-sultan.html, 
  there is an excellent , comprehensive german language article `` im bett mit dem sultan '' ( `` in bed with the sultan '' ) on ms merkel 's schemes and dealings : http://www.welt.de/print/wams/politik/article153229841/im-bett-mit-dem-sultan.html, 
  a more stable turkey can not be achieved by even more violence and oppression , as you suggest with your horrible terminology of `` cleaning up '' . 
  a more stable turkey can only be achieved by wise political choices , recognizing and balancing legitimate interests , and smart policies . 
  [ here is a blueprint ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) . 
  ms merkel could make a start by clearly stating that she is * not * inviting everybody in the middle east who wants a better life to come to germany . 
  this perception of her amateurish , dilettant communication on the issue is still widespread there . 
  correcting it would be a good start . 
  and it does not need much time to find a sensible overall policy on the migration/refugee issue . 
  even the small fdp , which is not even represented in the bundestag and can not draw on the ressources of a faction there , could draw a convincing [ concept ] ( https://www.fdp.de/position/fluechtlingspolitik ) . 
  the problem is that our `` grand coalition '' and ms merkel at its helm lack the courage and the leadership to step out of the swamp of moraline acid and self-delusion in which they are stuck . 
  i definitely do not want germany to be `` multicultural '' in the sense of multiple different parallel societies existing next to each other . 
  i abhor such `` multiculturalism '' . 
  i want germany to be one unified and individually diverse open society . 
  our national anthem starts with `` einigkeit und recht und freiheit '' . 
  a canada-style immigration law suits this concept well . 
   do you realise canadas immigration law has nothing to do with war refugees ? 
  absolutely . 
  but it has much to do with refugees who want to stay in germany after the reason for them being refugees ( like civil war in syria ) is over . 
   also , do you realise germany ( meaning cdu and spd , who are in the government right now ) are working on a canada like law ? 
  this is not true . 
  the fdp demands that for 10 years , the afd has picked up this demand 3 years ago , and cdu/csu , spd and greens have always opposed it because they fear a transparent public debate about immigration . 
  it would be great news if their recent electoral disasters cause the latter three to overcome their fear . 
  the canadian immigration system is in place , and copying it would be a vast improvement for germany ( directly as well as indirectly by encouraging transparent public debate ) . 
  if canadians were to walk away from their own system now because they find it `` politically incorrect '' , i would like to copy that system even more . 
  selecting among immigration applicants within an annual quota and according to clear criteria ( point system ) set by our own citizens/parliament , on the basis of public debate , is not yet considered `` politically correct '' in germany . 
  germany suffers from a deep angst of transparent debate about migration , including the many selection issues involved , in most quarters of the establishment of politics and media . 
  i sincerely hope this can be overcome ( and inter alia a canada-style immigration law implemented ) , before this achilles heel of political discourse in germany does real damage to our republic . 
   syria degenerating into civil war was n't on erdogan erdogan was the single most important factor for syria degenerating into civil war . 
  and he is the single most important factor for perpetuating that civil war today , as we speak . 
   even damascuss or baghdad did n't have 3 suicide bombings in the last 6 months . 
  as far as i can see , damascus had 3 and bagdad circa 20 suicide bombings within the last 6 months . 
  money . 
  and why not support turkey becoming the dominant power of the middle east , if they would choose to be a modernising ( instead of an islamist ) power ? 
  it would absolutely be in line with european middle east policy anyway , and would in particular mean support for a sensible kurdish policy , embracing the progressive kurdish movement . 
  concerning the middle east , we `` outsiders '' in my humble opinion can and should consistently ( ! ), 
  nurture and support every force and actor moving ( from however deep a shithole they might be in ) into the right direction . 
  akp/erdogan are moving both turkey and the wider region into the wrong direction . 
  glad to note that mr hollande appears not to be willing to dilute the european union , its values and procedures , in the name of cheap opportunism : [ ` no concessions ' to turkey on rights , visas in migrant deal : france ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/no-concessions-to-turkey-on-rights-visas-in-migrant-deal-france-.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=96364&amp;newscatid=351 ), 
   dude says he does n't respect the constitutional court in front of everybody there is a readworthy comment up in h\u00fcrriyet daily news , [ the rage against the constitutional court ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/the-rage-against-the-constitutional-court.aspx?pageid=449&amp;nid=96345&amp;newscatid=411 ), 
  from a foreign policy perspective , this article fits well with the recent excellent blueprint and call upon the republic of turkey to be true to itself with the title [ how can turkey overcome its foreign policy mess ? 
  ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) by former senior cia official graham e. fuller . 
  i absolutely agree that there was a disastrous delusional love and support for akp/erdogan from western establishments/media in the early years . 
  i remember uncountable occasions where i was the only person in a room to argue against that delusional projecting everything one wishes for into the `` moderate islamist '' ( the term is as much nonsense today as it ever was ) , no absurdity barred . 
  i am glad that these days of crazy are over now , and people in the west more and more see erdogan for the anti-open-society wannabe-sultan he is .
