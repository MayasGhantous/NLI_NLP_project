   erdo\u011fan put turkey on an irreversible course and the worst is yet to come . 
  i do not think it is `` irreversible '' in the long run . 
  however , i agree that we will probably see many more nasty things to come before sanity is back . 
  fgm is existent only in kurdish regions of iraq ( not among kurds in turkey , syria or iran ) . 
  it is probably no coincidence that only iraqi kurds have to encounter [ a sultanistic system ( of mr barzani ) ] ( http://carnegie-mec.org/2015/08/17/kurdistan-s-politicized-society-confronts-sultanistic-system/ieta ) in their polity . 
  it is a shame that one had to [ look south of the turkish border into syria ] ( https://twitter.com/drpartizan_/status/706838035346939904 ) to find heartfelt celebration of international women 's day . 
  turkey can do better than with its current government , and it should . 
  would you agree that a person of `` gypsy '' background may and can choose to be the person he/she wants to be , self-determine his/her life , like anyone else ? 
  not only eu leaders , but also many german citizens are unhappy about ms merkel 's dilettant , amateurish handling of the migrant issue in general and her absurd policy of handing any tribute including eu access to wannabe-sultan erdogan as an alleged `` saviour '' in her mess in particular . 
   core values are for domestic politics , not for foreign policy . 
  i am glad that many wise people in the past have taken my and not your position , so that mankind can enjoy a pretty liberal world order today . 
  i do sincerely hope that europe will not sell out its core values over an insincere irregular migration deal with the akp/erdogan regime in turkey . 
  such a deal is not without alternatives , registration/detention centers in greece , financed by the eu and supported by frontex , are a viable alternative . 
  plus a syria policy that ignores [ turkish pettiness ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) and decisively supports the syrian democratic forces in their successful effort to end the `` islamic state '' and the civil war in syria , and support reconstruction in the vast areas in northern syria under their secular , liberty and democracy based control . 
  ( edit ) a remarkable side note is that while ms merkel helped akp/erdogan secure an election victory over the non-sultanist opposition in turkey last november , mr erdogan is now setting the stage for an electoral disaster of ms merkel 's party next weekend . 
  lesson is , take care who you get in bed with . 
  sorry , i just reposted from twitter without looking at the date . 
  apparently mr erdogan did not have the frivolity to say that on today 's international women 's day , as it appeared . 
  my bad . 
  i do not think `` that 's how it works there '' , if `` there '' means turkey . 
  the [ kemalist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kemalist_ideology ) republic of turkey established women and men as equals under the law well before much of the rest of the world . 
  have a word with [ sabiha g\u00f6k\u00e7en ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabiha_g%c3%b6k%c3%a7en ) . 
  the issue is that the akp and [ erdogan ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/images/news/201212/n_38016_1.jpg ) have pulled the dark forces of anti-modernity , anti-open-society to the center stage . 
  so that today we find that while izmir is a european city , progressive governed [ kobane ] ( https://twitter.com/drpartizan_/status/706838035346939904 ) in kurdish syria is closer to europe than islamist dark holes and akp/erdogan strongholds in turkey like konya . 
  my petition is that all those who sincerely cherish the values of enlightenment and humanism , who want to walk the path of open society and liberal democracy , get aware of their common ground and with the bright light of the sun burn the forces of darkness , burn islamist and other totalitarian ideology to ashes . 
  political ethics evolve with the time . 
  i am not an expert on that dersim thing , but basically the atat\u00fcrk government ( atat\u00fcrk himself was in the dusk of his lifetime then , one aspect clearly is that his government felt a particular duty to close that file before his death ) did what all other nations of the time did in the course of establishing their nation states . 
  our modern world would not exist without that time including the suffering it caused , so i do not blame atat\u00fcrk for it . 
  pretty much every european nation state is built on its `` dersims '' . 
  my issue are rather people who refuse to understand that what was generally considered an acceptable , and maybe unavoidable , course of action in 1938 need not be an acceptable course of action in 2016 . 
  my issue is people who think the answer to the kurdish issue in 2016 would simply be more bombs . 
  it is neither acceptable nor does it work today . 
  im my view , it is almost an insult to atat\u00fcrk ( who used to give the smartest answers of the time to the challenges of the time ) to suggest he would address the challenges of 2016 with the methods of 1938 . 
  this twitter account where i linked a tweet from is not `` my '' twitter account , and i have no relation to it . 
  i know this twitter account pretty well because tweets from there are often submitted at / r/syriancivilwar . 
  i am `` ethnically german '' . 
  who suggests otherwise ? 
  hard to imagine that anyone would call [ these women ] ( https://twitter.com/drpartizan_/status/706838035346939904 ) `` terrorist '' ... but i hear there are people who , while looking at this tweet , see enemies and dangers for the republic of turkey ... while i , when looking at this tweet , see a huge and historic opportunity for the republic of turkey , both in foreign and internal policy ... 
  my post history can only be perceived as tasting `` anti-turkish '' if one considers turkey/turks in a zero-sum-game against the progressive kurdish movement , which i do not . 
  you will not find anything in my post history that is in contradiction to anything i wrote in this thread . 
  just take my most recent post , where i linked [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/drpartizan_/status/706838035346939904 ) , what definitely will be perceived as `` anti-turkish '' by some . 
  however , when i look at this tweet , i see not enemies of the republic of turkey but a huge , yet unrealized , opportunity for the republic of turkey , both internal and in foreign policy . 
  i just wanted to demonstrate with that picture that the sympathy and friendship is not gone , it is just in the freezer while/where perceptions of `` turkey '' are dominated by `` erdogan '' . 
  and i share your ethics about sincerety . 
  well , i am much involved in demonizing the person and policies of akp/erdogan here in germany , especially the foreign policies ( including hammering `` isis is bad and the akp/erdogan government of turkey supports isis '' in every head ) . 
  and i do it for exactly the reason you give , the aim to fight the underlying ideologies ( which erdogan just exploits , i agree with you on this ) . 
  i am aware that in many perceptions in all quarters , the difference between `` erdogan '' and `` turkey '' often gets blurred . 
  but i accept this collateral damage not least because i know and see how easy and overwhelming the salvation is and will be once turkey is turkey without erdogan but the republic true to itself . 
   there is a common saying here about `` the turk has no friend but the turk '' . 
  oh , i heard of people who at least had the mountains ... 
  but seriously , we are your friends . 
  learn german , write stuff from a contemporary chp perspective in german language social networks and pick any girl you wish . 
  once turkey will have a political leadership true to the republic ( and concurring policies along lines elaborated in this article ) , `` the west '' will be more than happy to embrace turkey . 
  for illustration , every ethnic turkish person that speaks or writes a plain kemalist/chp perspective on the state of affairs and perspective to a german audience these days is drowned in love and admiration . 
  i absolutely agree with what you say here in substance , `` turkey is the one that has the most potential to be a progressive society '' , and i would point out that while some of this potential is not ( yet ) realized , much of it is realized . 
  i denounce any perception that i would ever have painted it otherwise . 
  actually my greatest hope would be for turkey to assume a role of lighthouse and leader into enlightened modernity for neighbouring societies . 
  i would like to point you to this ( in my humble opinion excellent ) recent article [ how can turkey overcome its foreign policy mess ? 
  ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) with which i fullheartedly agree . 
  can we meet there , including the paragraphs concerning turkey and kurds ? 
  and as there appears to be a deep misunderstanding , once again : i cherish the progressive kurdish movement exactly for the fact that the starting point of kurdish societies is the opposite of progressive . 
  i have no personal attachment to either turkishness or kurdishness whatsoever . 
  i admire atat\u00fcrk for the incredible , historic feat to catapult his country from the swamp that the middle east was/is into enlightened modernity , into an [ open society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_society ) , into the champions league of nations , and this even within such a short span of time . 
  i view this as quite unparalleled in human history even beyond the region . 
  i have great sympathies for the progressive kurdish movement , because it in principle , if from a different situation and in different ways , seeks thus transformation of their societies into modernity as well . 
  and i appreciate that exactly for the reason that the starting point of kurdish societies is the opposite of anything progressive ( my opinion of mr barzani , by the way , is as low as my opinion of mr erdogan ) . 
  and to close the circle : i am convinced if mustafa kemal pasha would live today , he would go for a smart policy of synergy with the progressive kurdish movement , for the benefit of both the republic and its citizens . 
  my pain with turkish politics is that i do not feel someone would be about to go that path ( i like kilicdaroglu for i think his ideas go the right way , but he just lacks the something to lead the way ) . 
  i would vote chp if i were a citizen of the republic of turkey , and i consider mustafa kemal pasha the greatest politician who ever lived in that region of the globe . 
  just for the record . 
  hmm ... terrorist ... [ are you one of these 7000 people ] ( http://www.glamour.com/inspired/blogs/the-conversation/2015/08/feminists-terrorists-petition ) ? 
    turkish police fire rubber bullets to break up women 's day rally  the issue here is ( ... ) why the rally was not given permission to take place well , [ here is the short answer ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/images/news/201212/n_38016_1.jpg ) to your question . 
  never heard they were vergan and hope they are not , because it would make them lose my sympathies . 
  but as you appear interested in the challenge of modernising middle east societies via modern equality of women , i just stumbled over a recent article about rojava titled [ syria : feminist hope amid multi-sided conflict ] ( https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/61237 ) which you will definitely enjoy . 
  this subreddit apparently has become a playground for ultra-nationalist , extreme right-wing turks . 
  some weeks ago i managed to collect more than 300 downvotes in a single thread for basically suggesting that turkey should implement the european charter of local self-government ( which it actually has an obligation to implement ) and grant european standard autochthonous ethnic minority rights . 
  * edit : please continue downvoting this comment , dear ultra-nationalists , wingnuts & friends from turkey . 
  this is real life comedy the audience does not want to miss . 
  i recommend https://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup16/batch%202/peacetime-regime.pdf by the way , the policy recommendation for europe which the author considers by far most important is to create a european digital communications equipment producer as an alternative to cisco and huawei . 
  without this , everything else would be in vain . 
  out of curiosity , do you consider someone who envisions a republic of turkey that implements the european charter of local self-government and grants european standard autochthonous ethnic minority rights `` pro-turkey '' or `` anti-turkey '' ? 
  if it is the former , then the entire progressive kurdish movement is rather `` pro-turkey '' . 
  you are aware that the pkk does not seek an independent state kurdistan , right ? 
  you doubt that the secular syrian democratic forces with the mainly kurdish , progressive ypg at their core are successfully fighting and beating back isis ? 
  google it . 
  here are the most recent advances from today : https://twitter.com/unitekurdistan/status/706249066099908609 https://twitter.com/unitekurdistan/status/706256426965016576, 
   a few ? 
  there are kurds in isil too  yes , kurdish societies traditionally are almost as bigot islamist as arab societies , and isis draws a lot of kurdish recruits ( especially in iraq ) . 
  this is the one big reason why we all should with all our hearts and minds support the progressive kurdish movement which transformed and transforms kurdish society for good . 
  regrettably , the sultanist akp/erdogan regime in turkey sees exactly these progressive kurds as their enemy they dream to annihilate , and cherishes islamist kurds as their partners in islamist crime . 
  i did not claim that `` you '' would support isis and the other jihadi islamists ( there is not much difference between them ) fighting `` the kurds '' , namely the ypg , in syria . 
  my claim is that the akp/erdogan government does . 
  and this claim is supported by a mountain of evidence and mr. erdogan boasting about it at every occasion . 
  i did not claim that this policy of supporting jihadi islamists in syria would be smart from the standpoint of the republic of turkey . 
  rather to the opposite , i find it incredibly stupid . 
  if you are interested in my opinion for a better turkish foreign policy , i totally agree with this blueprint [ how can turkey overcome its foreign policy mess ? 
  ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) for a better foreign policy for turkey by former senior cia official graham e. fuller . 
  isis is fighting to annihilate the secular progressive kurdish movement in syria . 
  the akp/erdogan government ( and wide stretches of the political establishment in turkey as well as many redditors with a turkey flair ) agree that it is desirable to erase the secular progressive kurdish movement from the face of the earth . 
  in addition , the akp/erdogan government also supports isis because it generally weakens any secular forces in syrian politics , thus supporting the project of a radically sunni islamist syria that mr. erdogan pursues .
