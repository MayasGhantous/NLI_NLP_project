  my link is about turkish artillery fire into the syrian province of hasakah ( which is all controlled by secular syrian democratic forces with the mainly kurdish ypg at their core ) , targeting ypg . 
  the op 's link claimed that there would also be turkish artillery fire into the syrian province of aleppo , allegedly targeting isis there . 
  would you want me to offer some evidence of turkey shelling areas held by the syrian democratic forces in the syrian province of aleppo ? 
  turkey has done so for weeks , supporting diverse jihadi islamist groups and committing horrifying atrocities against secular civilians . 
  i recommend you take a look at this megathread at the expert subreddit / r/syriancivilwar https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/45lnw4/megathread_about_turkishksa_coalition_and/, 
  i wish this were true . 
  however , it appears that turkey ( to be more precise , the sultanist akp/erdogan government there ) is shelling the secular , progressive kurds , their ypg defence forces , who are successfully fighting and beating back isis . 
  good and interesting read ... this is the kind of submission that suits / r/europe ... upvoted ... 
  anmesty international [ has an article up ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/03/turkey-fears-of-zaman-newspaper-takeover/ ) on the issue now . 
  well , this is pretty much the only english-language source from turkey openly critical of the akp/erdogan government which was left . 
  will be difficult in the future to submit coverage of turkey which does not just praise the sultan and his agenda of one-man-rule . 
  will this get me 72 virgins ? 
  where can i pick the girls up ? 
  to avoid misunderstandings , you are not actually suggesting that , say , [ the famous tweet of bilgin \u00c7ift\u00e7i ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/03/lord-of-rings-director-insult-to-erdogan-mistaken-as-gollum-as-charcter-is ) had the potential to `` threaten the existence of the republic of turkey '' , are you ? 
  mostly agree , i just would not call it `` fault '' as in particular erdogan but also hardliners in the kck got exactly the civil war environment they sought . 
  what surprises me is that there is so few challenge in turkey to that narrative that ever more violence and incitement for `` annihilation of the opponent '' would be the answer to the kurdish issue . 
  here is something with examples i wrote about / r/turkey half a year ago , about [ rare gems in that subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeysubredditwatch/comments/3n34v7/rare_gems_at_rturkey_moments_of_sanity/ ) and about the [ failure of the moderating team ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeysubredditwatch/comments/3k7aoy/failure_of_moderating_team_at_rturkey/ ) . 
  if you want particular examples for explicit stuff , see [ one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeysubredditwatch/comments/3juvqd/dehumanization_its_like_killing_cancer_cells/ ) , [ two ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeysubredditwatch/comments/3jw0ie/encouraging_death_no_different_than_isis_there/ ) , [ three ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeysubredditwatch/comments/3k2fcz/racism_kurds_on_the_other_hand_i_hate_them_like/ ) , [ four ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeysubredditwatch/comments/3k8190/racism_not_vandalized_because_its_a_kurdish_store/ ) . 
  and if you want to experience it yourself , just go there and write that the driving force behind all this pkk thing might be legitimate grievances , like the denial of basic collective rights as an autochthonous ethnic minority , or the non-implementation of the european charter of local self-government . 
  have fun . 
  this is nonsense . 
  i once wrote here that during my student days i had an affair with a pkk-affine fellow student kurdish girl , which was particularily thrilling as i publicly supported the kemalist republic and its policies and operations during the de-facto-civil-war in the southeast in the 1990s . 
  this is all , no brothers or family involved . 
  as far as i know , my ancestry all ethnic german ( including austrian ) down to 1760 . 
  before that there was definitely some polish/lithuanian contribution , maybe there was also a turk before that , or a kurd , who knows . 
  in the end we are all african . 
  historically , holding right wing nationalist views and admiration for wannabe-sultan erdogan are not correlated . 
  however , since erdogan in the summer of 2015 embarked on inciting and exploiting turkish nationalist attitudes against kurdish assertiveness ( this is not simply about `` the pkk '' as an organisation ) , the two appear as an ugly pragmatic couple , held together by the worst of either of them . 
  this is a matter of perspective . 
  from a mainstream 21st century european perspective , the vast majority consensus at / r/turkey is right-wing nationalist with excursions to the extreme . 
  thank you for the link . 
  i liked to watch the scene , i did previously only read the quote of this speech by chp gaziantep deputy akif ekici in the article [ turkey 's main opposition leader calls erdo\u011fan a ` narcissist ' ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=95913&amp;newscatid=338 )  `` i 'm proposing to [ the four political parties in parliament ] .

  but then family elders and leading figures of the neighborhood gather and persuade this person to get treated .

  thank you for the upvote . 
  those are people on the wrong side of history , and the downvote brigading on reddit against anything that casts light on the reality in turkey today must be somewhere in the [ five stages of grief ] ( http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/ ) . 
  as of yesterday , there have been [ 1,845 cases opened for insulting president erdogan ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/turkey-1845-cases-opened-for-insulting-erdogan/2016/03/02/fdb51a44-e05d-11e5-8c00-8aa03741dced_story.html ) since his election into the office of president in 2014 . 
  actually chp-leader mr kilicdaroglu already faces various attempts to remove his parliamentary immunity and indict him for `` insulting erdogan '' for other incidents , not only [ from mr erdogan and `` his '' government ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/national_main-opposition-leader-faces-motion-to-remove-immunity-for-insulting-erdogan_413371.html ) but also [ from no less than 10.000 erdogan fanboys ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=95691&amp;newscatid=338 ) . 
  another opposition leader , mr dimirtas from the hdp , has the same problem : [ mr erdogan seeks to have him imprisoned for one to four years for allegedly insulting him ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/national_complaint-filed-against-opposition-leader-alleging-insult-against-president_413671.html ) . 
  thus happens to many citizens of turkey these days . 
  only the most bizarre cases are still considered news , like when [ a man files a criminal complaint against his wife for `` insulting erdogan '' ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/02/23/turkish-man-sues-wife-for-insulting-president-erdogan/ ) .

  pointing to the issue of narcissism is probably the most relevant analysis of contemporary problems in turkish politics , in two dimensions : on the one hand the personal motivation/agenda of `` center man '' erdogan , who is driven by a narcissism which is extraordinary even for the standard of middle east politics . 
  on the other hand his formula for winning support even in the face of policy failures across the board , namely nurturing and appealing to a collective supremacist narcissism in the electorate . 
  my experience is that * today 's zaman * is no less accurate , sincere and trustworthy than * hurriyet daily news * and much more accurate , sincere and trustworthy than * daily sabah * , to compare the three major english language outlets in turkey . 
  and compared to * hurriyet daily news * ( i compare every day ) , * today 's zaman * is considerably less inhibited in reporting . 
  i find that there is nothing better to quote from turkey in english than * today 's zaman * ( the * cumhurriyet * to my utmost regret is not available in english ) .

  excellent text . 
  both europe and her diverse nations are mutually inclusive layers of identity for europeans . 
  you think erdogan might find him erotically attractive ? 
  this comment could [ cost you $ 2,740 ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-erdogan-cartoon-idusl6n0wr1wl20150325 ) , dude ( if you demonstrate good conduct during your trial , otherwise it appears to be a prison term ) . 
  the turkish akp/erdogan government talking about securing its border with syria instead of invading syria is definitely progress to cherish . 
  now they have to stop shelling syria and stop sending jihadi islamists and weapons for jihadi islamists over the border , and things will be fine . 
  on top of that even allowing humanitarian aid to cross the border outside of jihadi islamist held territories on the syrian side would probably be too much to ask for . 
  the deluded and desperate channcelor of my country , a certain ms. merkel , does not want anyone to address the issues because she still believes mr. erdogan would be her hero and saviour . 
  i never felt so ashamed for german politics/policy all of my life . 
  as to my knowledge , you are a turkish national and speak turkish , and certainly have better opportunities to research chp programs than me . 
  there is an internet service called [ google ] ( https://www.google.de/ ) that might be helpful for you . 
  should i be wrong about you speaking turkish , or if using google is a challenge for you , here is an english language [ review of the june 2015 chp election manifesto ] ( http://researchturkey.org/chps-election-manifesto-is-it-the-key-to-government/ ) . 
  i would rather ask for chp and chp 's position today , not 15 years ago , because the party progressed a lot for good . 
  it clearly is the party of liberty , open society and rule of law today . 
  by the way , here is a [ good interview ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/interviews_belge-i-do-not-think-i-will-live-long-enough-to-see-democracy-in-this-country_406169.html ) with one of all those turkey 's liberal intellectuals who supported akp 15 years ago , and now bitterly regret it . 
  my understanding from the diverse remarks mr. kilicdaroglu made over the past couple of months and years , that he would * grosso modo * agree with the analysis in [ this smart recent article ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) on a better turkish foreign policy . 
  just as , in my humble opinion , every sincere politician who cares for the interests of the republic and the interests of the citizens of the republic should . 
  here is `` 5 facts why turkey is in trouble '' in one picture : https://twitter.com/sayed_ridha/status/701001691106136064, 
  quotes from the closing arguments of the article :  devote priority to close relations with all kurdish elements in the region . 
  ( ... ) erdogan has allowed his earlier path-breaking rapprochement with the kurdish nationalist movement in turkey , the pkk , to collapse . 
  ankara has refused to deal with the syrian kurdish movement , one of the few effective fighting groups against isis in syria . 
  it may be sliding into a general war against the kurds which it might be able win on the battlefield but will assuredly lose politically . 
   growing kurdish power in the entire region is a reality - it has been on an upward curve for the last 25 years , invariably benefitting from each regional conflict to achieve greater de facto autonomy and world awareness . 
  if ankara is determined to stop kurdish progress towards greater autonomy - anywhere in the region - it will only alienate the kurds ( ... ) efforts to block this process of kurdish emergence will not only fail , but will guarantee an uglier and more dangerous relationship for turkey and the entire regional kurdish reality long into the future . 
   ironically , handled right and granted broader autonomy , most kurds will inevitably look to turkey as a regional protector , economic entrep\u00f4t and cultural magnet - as long as ankara does not alienate them . 
  where else could the kurds look for valuable geopolitical ties in the region ? 
  ( ... )  all this also assumes that erdogan will act wisely and not sacrifice turkey 's foreign policy interests to his own reckless and divisive drive for greater personal power . 
  erdogan 's personal interests are not synonymous with the turkish national interest . 
  erdogan had once embraced and implemented ataturk 's wise adage : peace at home and peace abroad . 
  now he has abandoned those principles and is left with neither . 
   how can you controll every aspect of the public and personal life of an individual as part of the state `` softly '' ? 
  oh , the `` green '' party of germany made an art out of trying this . 
  but i agree with you on our case at hand , the akp-erdogan-regime in turkey is neither soft nor totalitarian , but authoritarian , in a disgustingly vulgar way . 
   ypg general command said they have no links to the ankara attack , remarking that davuto\u011flu put forward this accusation to pave the way for an offensive on rojava and syria .

   former head of police intelligence unit : `` type of explosive used in the #ankarabombing points to isis . '', 
  i am not really surprised that you perceive ( or just arbitrarily denounce ) a reasonable mainstream secular european human rights perspective as `` pkk propaganda comments '' . 
  you will have a great career in turkish politics . 
   lmao lmao back . 
  this turkish habbit of entire debates where everyone just calls the other guy `` terrorist supporter '' instead of arguing is very funny to us outsiders , too . 
  a totalitarian political ideology like nazism or islamism is a major problem , an ultimate enemy of our open society . 
  public terror attacks are only a one late symptom , which is not even necessary for the totalitarian political ideology to crawl its evil path . 
  actually there is plenty of islamist terror in germany every day , but it is not much noticed because the victims are `` only '' immigrant women with muslim background . 
  as you spread * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * jihadi propaganda , i definitely do not take you serious . 
  but as you show a dutch flag , i sincerely hope the dutch police has an eye on you . 
  the one organisation in turkey that should be on lists of terrorist organisations is the akp , which is founded around a hard core of * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * islamists and has an abhorrent record of giving support to each and every jihadi terrorist and other proponent of the totalitarian political ideology of islamism in the middle east . 
  even [ while we speak ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/chp-head-again-accuses-turkish-govt-of-sending-arms-to-jihadists.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=95291&amp;newscatid=338 ) . 
    are kurds also allowed to learn their language in schools ? 
   i found that , it was elective in \u0130mam hatip schools and exactly this is my criticism of the kurdish policy of the clepto-islamist akp regime in turkey . 
  they are harassing and persecuting anything secular kurdish , trying to deny and roll back enlightenment , force citizens of kurdish ethnicity even more than all other citizens into the dark barbarian realm of the sharia mind . 
  the one reason why i cherish the progressive kurdish movement ( including not only the hdp but also the pkk ) is that they want to open a path for a modern , secular , enlightened , emancipated life for those citizens of the republic of turkey that value their kurdish ethnicity .
