  no other party convincingly does that : they either deny citizens to live a kurdish identity , or deny them a secular lifestyle , or both . 
  or bitcoins . 
  and time will bring plenty alternatives for money that can neither be put under total ( itarian ) surveillance nor manipulated for negative interest rates , i am optimistic about that . 
  but we the citizens have to fight for it , just like we have to fight for cash now . 
  i find your implied idea that the entire retail industry would have `` questionable business ethics '' and probably not pay proper taxes , well , absurd ( by the way , tax authorities can very well see what they buy and deduce turnover from that ) . 
  and your idea to strip every citizen , every consumer of any privacy just for the purpose of you feeling better like that is an absurd and abhorrent idea , in my view ( and i will be polite enough not to tell you what this idea makes me think about you as a person ) . 
  first of all non-commercial transactions do not need an invoice at all . 
  second there are plenty of commercial transactions that do not need an invoice ( practically almost all of them with the consumer side ) . 
  of all economic transactions any given day , much less than one percent involve an invoice . 
  third the content of my invoices is not stored in any database other than my own . 
  if you are not intentionally trying to mislead the audience , my question is : why is it so difficult for you to understand the principle and reality of a liberty-based open society as opposed to a totalitarian surveillance society ? 
  i agree that gold is even better in principle , but for everyday purposes the battle for liberty today is about the possibility to at least use anonymous `` paper money '' . 
  i do not mind you paying with a credit card , if you want that . 
  and i respectfully ask you to not mind or even try to prohibit me paying cash . 
  there is not even a general obligation to invoice every economic transaction , and of course private parties are under no general obligation to legally identify the people they interact with , or even report them to any authorities . 
  whatever the motivation behind your agenda to promote totalitarian surveillance may be , please do not mislead our audience . 
  trust me , cash will stay with us for our lifetime . 
  and we can be very grateful for that . 
  `` the other side of transactions '' has to declare income , but not from whom . 
  there is no legitimate rationale in a free and open society for total surveillance of what every citizen does with his or her money . 
  what i spend my money for is my private thing , and there is no legitimate reason why it should be enforced to be `` transparent '' to you , to a credit card company , to the state or to whomever . 
  my wish to live my life using cash is not in contradiction with any wish of yours how to live your own life , but only in contradiction with your megalomanic desire to dictate other people how to live their lives . 
   you can never satisfy everyone , you just have to satisfy the majority . 
  in my humble opinion , the state should not try to satisfy anyone , by what `` official satifaction ideology '' ever , but just let every citizen pursue their own happiness as they themselves wish . 
  and the term `` majority '' has absolutely no place in this discussion . 
  every citizen has the right to live his or her own life , no matter if you count them as part of your `` majority '' or not . 
  remarkable that only 24 hours ago , this subreddit had a great thread on [ czechoslovak jokes about the communist regime ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45o5p5/czechoslovak_jokes_about_the_communist_regime/ ) with more than 1400 upvotes . 
  maybe , however , some people wish those funny times back . 
  ca n't we make your idea of justice the principle of a general eu prohibition policy ? 
  everything that you do not deem useful for yourself should be prohibited for every citizen in the european union . 
  abolishing the 500 euro bill does not save anyone any money , as for each there have to be five 100 euro bills printed instead . 
  not even the ecb claims that this would save them money , in fact it is rather the opposite . 
  cash is liberty . 
  cash is freedom from surveillance . 
  cash is a citizens ' sanctuary against enforced arbitrary negative interest rate policies by central banks to bail out irresponsible sovereign debt policies , and/or to manipulate people 's individual intertemporal economic choices . 
  european citizens should not allow cash to be outlawed . 
  while the abolishment of the 500 euro bill is a rather symbolical move in this direction , we should be alert . 
  who does the current erdoganist regime of turkey fight against in syria ? 
  here is an excellent recent article `` erdogan 's foreign policy is in ruins '' in * foreign policy * on the matter : http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/04/erdogans-foreign-policy-is-in-ruins/ you can also find [ the text ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/44a31g/erdogans_foreign_policy_is_in_ruins/czoo87o ) in the syrian civil war subreddit . 
  the cherished expert sub / r/syriancivilwar / is a great place for both real time and background information in any case . 
  the syrian democratic forces ( [ sdf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_democratic_forces ) ) , and the defence forces of rojava ( [ ypg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people's_protection_units ) ) at their core , did at no point shoot at turkey or turkish troops . 
  the only thing they shot and shoot at are islamist groups of all stripes , and occasionally at the assad regime . 
  while making the area controlled by them the only place in syria where people can live free and under democratic rules . 
  ( [ article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/middleeast/on-the-road-in-syria-struggle-all-around.html ) , [ article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/middleeast/on-the-road-in-syria-struggle-all-around.html ) ), 
  qatar has been sponsoring islamist [ muslim brotherhood ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3kqf19/the_politicalideological_differences_between/cuzx9uu ) affiliates everywhere in the middle east , irrespective of pipelines . 
  they do it for power political reasons in the shared realm of [ totalitarian islamist political ideology ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/41hujg/difference_between_islamist_salafist/cz2jvo7 ) , for good reason , because it politically legitimizes the rule of the regime in qatar . 
  with all due respect , trying to explain middle eastern policy by `` pipeline interests '' as an alleged dominant hidden agenda borders on conspiracy theory . 
  in reality , this kind of stuff are considerations of lesser importance somewhere down the agenda for every major actor . 
  and for the bottom line , i can assure you that nobody in policy making circles in europe wants saudi arabia and turkey to start their sunni wahhabi islamist invasion war games in syria . 
  if the public opinion in turkey would overcome its [ attitude of annihilation against kurdishness ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-revival-of-lynching-culture-against-kurds.html ) , if turkey would like a civilized country co-opt kurdish identity into the civil society ( and implement the [ european charter of local self-government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_of_local_self-government ) ) , it could easily end the [ intensifying civil war with its ethnic kurdish population ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/escalating-turkish-civil-war-sees-young-fighters-on-front-a-1076663.html ) which does not want to be genocided and marginalized away , and there would be no reason anymore for a pkk or other armed kurdish resistance . 
  however , if erdoganist turkey should now double down on its [ epically failed foreign policy now in ruins ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/04/erdogans-foreign-policy-is-in-ruins/ ) that [ antagonized everyone ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_turkey-at-odds-with-russia-and-now-the-us-on-syria_412104.html ) up to the point where its only `` friends '' left are stone age islamists like saudi arabia , and start a jihadist war of aggression to invade syria , together with totalitarian wahhabi saudi arabia , in order to gonocide and marginalize away both anything secular and anything kurdish , turks might as a result even [ lose their own homeland ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_opposition-leader-warns-of-catastrophe-in-event-of-syria-incursion_412233.html ) . 
  it is bizarre how the erdoganist regime in turkey doubles down on its [ epically failed foreign policy now in ruins ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/04/erdogans-foreign-policy-is-in-ruins/ ) that [ antagonized everyone ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_turkey-at-odds-with-russia-and-now-the-us-on-syria_412104.html ) up to the point where its only `` friends '' left are stone age islamists like saudi arabia and the good people of turkey with this latest islamist megalomania now even run the risk of [ losing their own homeland ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_opposition-leader-warns-of-catastrophe-in-event-of-syria-incursion_412233.html ) . 
  islamism has nothing to do with personal religiosity , it is the totalitarian political ideology of sharia . 
  erdogan cares very much about this totalitarian political ideology of islamism , and he does everything to promote it , because it promises him unlimited political power . 
  we have to realize that the islamist totalitarian political agenda of stone age hate , anti-modernity , anti-liberty , anti-individual-freedom , anti-open-society which mr. erdogan shares and pursues is the greatest danger in the world today for each of us and our children . 
  happy to upvote , as i welcome both ( 1 ) a reasonably citizen-friendly choice of legal forum for multinational internet services and ( 2 ) a pushback against the curse of pathologically exaggerated attitudes of prudishness and shame , the marker of enemies of the open society . 
  hard to make a tl ; dr because it is a feature with many impressive impressions . 
  it is worth the time reading . 
  politically blame is suggested on erdogan for cyn\u00edcally closing down every bit of the valuable space between the state and the pkk , in particular by boycotting and persecuting the hdp and the opportunity for mutual dialogue and reconciliation it offers . 
  the prognosis is more civil war and more blood . 
  really very readworthy . 
  one of the best pieces i have read on the issue in a while . 
  the tl ; dr is that the article argues such a move would do much good in several respects , like being very helpful in the fight against isis in syria and iraq , and that starting the process of delisting would put beneficial pressure on both ankara and the pkk to move towards mutual solution of their conflict on local government in turkey . 
  a lot of municipal councils in southeast turkey had declared autonomous self-rule after turkey not only for decades failed to implement the [ european charter of local self-government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_of_local_self-government ) but the current akp government in effect declared it would never implement meaningful local government . 
  then security forces arrested municipal councillors in many of those places , and in some local youth vowed to fight about it . 
  mr. erdogan went on [ to speak and act of annihilation ] ( http://p5.focus.de/img/fotos/origs5269693/8468438446-w1280-h960-q72-p4/erdogan.jpg ) .

  hope dies last . 
   you are alone . 
  we are coming for you . 
  well , tell me when mr. erdogan 's army conquered vienna ( but did n't he plan to raise the banner of his caliphate in damascus and jerusalem first ? ) . 
  until then i feel quite safe in berlin . 
   hostile to everybody around them sounds like the [ epically failed foreign policy of mr. erdogan ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/04/erdogans-foreign-policy-is-in-ruins/ ) . 
  here is the [ brief answer ] ( http://p5.focus.de/img/fotos/origs5269693/8468438446-w1280-h960-q72-p4/erdogan.jpg ) . 
  the long answer is this : they are protesting against the most brutal language of annihilation and military campaign to annihilate any form of modern , secular kurdish civil society and to eliminate any form of meaningful [ local government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_of_local_self-government ) that mr. erdogan 's regime wages in southeast turkey .

  * edit : your frank and casual call for genocide currently has 15 upvotes ? 
  this subreddit has become a remarkable place indeed . 
  there is a readworthy related article in the american * lawfareblog * , `` the case for delisting the pkk as a foreign terrorist organization '' . 
  it argues that such a move would do much good , like being very helpful the fight against isis in syria and iraq , and that starting the process of delisting would put beneficial pressure on both ankara and the pkk to move towards mutual solution of the conflict . 
  why so upset ? 
  are you a supporter not only of erdogan 's failed policies but also of [ fenerbahce ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/amedspor-holds-fenerbahce-to-draw-in-cup-quarterfinal.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=94952&amp;newscatid=362 ) ? 
  actually there is no real disagreement among experts on how a sensible european policy for refugees and immigration should look like ( and all political parties in germany , except only for the `` multiculture '' extremists , move there as well ) : effective control over the eu borders , keeping those with obviously unsubstantiated claims for asylum in closed camps until processing their applications ends with deportation , the much smaller number of those who appear actual warzone refugees get distributed over europe and in principle get sent back after the end of war , and canada-style immigration laws with quota and multidimensional point system for those who want to stay and demonstrate their will to integrate during their refugee status time . 
  [ erdogan featured at dusseldorf carnival float ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pqx0qwf.jpg ), 
  another effective way to combat reality is downvoting comments on reddit that confront you with reality . 
  as we speak , ever more ypg reinforcments cross the euphrates at tishrin dam , to join the us-supported operation to liberate manbij from isis : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/44q6lm/abdel_rahman_on_twitter_huge_ypg_reinforcements/ but if you downvote my comment now , it will not happen , and archaic sharia will continue to hold its barbarian grip on manbij . 
  so if you really love recep tayyip erdogan and want sharia , i recommend that you downvote this comment now . 
  ignoring reality always helps , because if you ignore reality , it goes away . 
  today the usa gave their answer , they will continue to work with the pro-modernity , pro-liberty , pro-rule-of-law , pro-democracy rojava project , people on the ground tell us that us forces arrive in kobane to advise the manbij operation . 
  but if you ignore it , it has not happened . 
  this is how it was perceived in the middle east ( including north africa ) . 
  you can easily learn that by yourself , there are plenty of english-speaking arab journalists and social media people around . 
  i believe that ms. merkel possibly did not intend that , at least not to this extent . 
  but communication is what the receiver perceives . 
  i would not accept to participate in redistribution either as long as irregular migrants that by no means are `` refugees '' are included . 
  the diverse elements of the sensible solution go only hand in hand . 
  ms. merkel made the mistake to factually invite everyone in the middle east who seeks a better life , or even just some adventure . 
  as long as there is no courage for selection ( very very bad word for germans ) , there is no solution .
