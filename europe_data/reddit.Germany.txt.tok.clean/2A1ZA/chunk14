  erdogan 's new idea to ignore the progressive kurdish movement and kurdish civil society and the hdp party , because they all reject his agenda for a sultanistic all-power-presidency , and instead seek anachronistic `` tribal leaders '' to talk to , in my humble opinion is moronic and bound to fail . 
   half of pyd 's casualties have been turkish kurds fighting in syria . 
  you probably mean ypg casualties ( as ypg is the defence forces of the rojava administration , while the pyd is a political party there ) . 
  however , is n't it curious that the only citizens of the republic of turkey that fall in the fight against isis are in the ranks of the ypg ? 
  for erdogan , it is even more a conflict with all people who want liberty , rule of law and secular democracy anywhere in the world , and in particular in the middle east . 
  of irregular migrants , for decades less than 2 percent have had a right to asylum . 
  another about 30 percent of current irregular migrants have a right of temporary secondary protection as warzone refugees . 
  all others should never leave the application center on a greek island and be deported quickly . 
  the will to manage that effectively and quickly will grow effectively and quickly with the upcoming elections in germany . 
  the idea of the rojava project has become the basis of the [ syrian democratic assembly ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3wdjzl/final_resolution_of_the_congress_establishing_the/ ) . 
  this is not about the kurds ruling syria , this is about an agenda of modernity , secularism , progress , liberty , rule of law , individual emancipation and comprehensive democracy ruling syria . 
  i agree with you that those internment centers for asylum applications on greek islands are a necessary component of a sensible policy . 
  people whose applications do not appear substantiated on first glance must be held there and should not be able to roam freely around europe , otherwise every other measure does not help . 
  when the first redditor without a [ history of calling for annihilation of any secular kurdish identity ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeysubredditwatch ) at / r/turkey will fundamentally challenge my views on the issue , i will reconsider . 
  promised . 
  however , this has not happened yet in the six months i have been on reddit . 
  thank you for a reasoned comment . 
  i agree with you that the future is uncertain . 
  but the rojava project is by far the best try we currently have for syria , as well as for the entire middle east . 
  so let 's give it a chance , everything else is horrible and without perspective anyway . 
  frontex has to get the money and the manpower to register , intern and first-check everyone who arrives at a greek island , same at all other eu external borders . 
  the fun of having a crowd of turkish nationalist extremists , turkish islamist extremists and turkish nationalist-islamist extremists with false us-flags and false eu-flags ( some even use others , i love that guy with the false brazilian flag ) or no flags at all calling me as a german `` biased '' in that affair is great . 
  actually there is no real disagreement among experts on how a sensible european policy for refugees and immigration should look like . 
  effective control over the eu borders , keeping those with obviously unsubstantiated claims for asylum in closed camps until processing their applications ends with deportation , the much smaller number of those who appear actual warzone refugees get distributed over europe and in principle get sent back after the end of war , and canada-style immigration laws with quota and multidimensional point system for those who want to stay and demonstrate their will to integrate during their refugee status time . 
  those few isolated incidents with respect to rojava , as * amnesty * itself presented it in one single report , have been debunked and proved false many times by anyone involved including the assumed `` victims '' . 
  but talking about * amnesty * and war crimes , there are real war crimes committed by erdogan 's so called security forces in turkey 's southeast , referenced in several recent reports of both * amnesty * and the un : http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/amnesty-turkish-army-operations-beginning-to-resemble-collective-punishment.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=94134&amp;newscatid=339 http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/amnesty-condemns-turkey-reckless-force-kurdish-areas-320888202 http://www.todayszaman.com/national_un-rights-chief-calls-on-turkey-to-probe-cizre-shooting-by-security-forces_411135.html, 
  of course europe can manage its immigration without erdogan . 
  we just need the will to do so . 
  and after the march elections in germany with epic losses for those parties who absurdly circlejerk in their lack the will to implement sensible immigration policies , the political class in germany will quickly find that will . 
  [ erdogan 's foreign policy is in ruins ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/04/erdogans-foreign-policy-is-in-ruins/ ) , that is for sure . 
  neo-ottoman megalomania , unprofessional narcissism , islamist obsessions and breathtaking dilettantism took their toll . 
  the progressive kurdish pyd , and the secular , pro-modernity , pro-liberty , pro-emancipation , pro-rule-of-law rojava administration they initiated , and the syrian democratic assembly and syrian democratic forces built around them , are not `` some militant group '' . 
  they are [ the only sincere proponent of civilization in the syrian civil war ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/middleeast/on-the-road-in-syria-struggle-all-around.html ) . 
  after [ erdogan 's foreign policy is in ruins ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/04/erdogans-foreign-policy-is-in-ruins/ ) , he now in a desperate act of real life satire seeks force the civilized world against the [ only sincere proponent of civilization in the syrian civil war ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/middleeast/on-the-road-in-syria-struggle-all-around.html ) . 
  pathetic . 
  please accept my humble , brotherly upvote . 
  the only difference between us appears to be that i categorically reject a political role for the political ideology of those supporters of `` moderate islamist rebels '' in syria , too . 
  i deserve enlightened open society , you deserve enlightened open society , and the good people of syria deserve enlightened open society as well . 
   west would prefer rebels over assad any-day no , `` the west '' would not prefer `` the rebels '' over assad any day . 
  just for illustration who these ( non-isis , not even al-qaidas 's jahbat al-nusra , just the `` moderates '' among them ! ), 
  islamist rebels in syria - who mr. erdogan loves so much - are , try `` tortured by ahrar al-sham for marrying a shi'ite : nadia sattif 's story '' from today for illustration : http://www.internationalboulevard.com/then-they-came-for-the-apostates/ there are good reasons why `` the west '' prefers the secular syrian democratic forces , secular and pro-modernity , built from the nucleus of rojava , over those `` rebels '' . 
  those people are actual refugees , they flee an active warzone for safety ( in turkey , or in kurdish controlled parts of syria ) . 
  unlike the crowd which ms. merkel invited to come to europe , who start their journey in safety and are motivated by seeking better economic conditions . 
  i do not say this because i would categorically reject temporary or mutual migration to europe , but just to counter your attack against sincerity in discourse . 
  erdogan is trying all the time , but he is on the wrong side of history and fails . 
  plus , the civilized world has effective antidotes against nationalist-islamist poison from erdogan-turkey . 
  at last , there is a ray of light in the darkness . 
  `` here is a solution for syria crisis , look at the inspirational rojava revolution initiated by syrian kurds '' , writes the * new york times * . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/middleeast/on-the-road-in-syria-struggle-all-around.html and the us government increasingly supports the secular , pro-modernity , pro-liberty , pro-rule-of-law , democratic rojava project not only by military air support , but also politically . 
  https://youtube.com/watch?v=n2xequtpsf8 in the end , something historic may be about to emerge from the syrian civil war , a path into a better future for the people of syria and in the whole of the middle east . 
  here is a very readworthy piece `` erdogan 's foreign policy is in ruins '' in * foreign policy * : http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/04/erdogans-foreign-policy-is-in-ruins/ if you have a paywall issue , the submission in the syrian civil war subreddit has the text in comments : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/44a31g/erdogans_foreign_policy_is_in_ruins/czoo87o, 
  those people are actual refugees , they flee an active warzone for safety ( in turkey , or in kurdish controlled parts of syria ) . 
  unlike the crowd which ms. merkel invited to come to europe , who start their journey in safety and are motivated by seeking better economic conditions . 
  i do not say this because i would categorically reject temporary or mutual migration to europe , but just to counter your attack against sincerity in discourse . 
  for background : foootball club amed sk from diyarbakir ( amed is the kurdish language name for the city of diyarbakir , the unofficial `` capital '' of the kurdish region of turkey ) plays in the third league in turkey , but happened to reach the quarter finals in this season 's football cup in turkey . 
  grotesque scenes against them from both the turkish football association and from fans of other clubs are abundant . 
  nice article `` this kurdish football club defies hate and violence '' ( in german ) : http://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/internationale-ligen/article151744966/dieser-kurdische-fussballverein-trotzt-hass-und-gewalt.html, 
  i use the term `` with a muslim background '' all the time . 
  it means having been raised in an environment where islam was a major influence . 
  the term `` with a muslim background '' is much better in political discourse than the term `` muslim '' , because the former is from an objective sociologial perspective while the latter refers to subjective inner beliefs of individuals which nobody else can know . 
  `` stone age '' in anthropology refers to hundreds of thousands of years of human pre-history before the invention of melting metal and the ensuing changes in society . 
  and here i use the term to refer to that dark time when the clan was everything , there was no survival without the clan , the individual was not attributed value for anything but for the clan he or she was part of . 
  and i refer to the remnants of this dark mentality , which exist to this day in the namus mentality , which we , as humanity , will have to wash down in the toilet of history . 
  the arab desert was not a place where anything was invented , well , except for a certain religion that sought to neatlessly adopt abrahamitic monotheism to the stone age namus mentality . 
  the resulting religion of the sword later violently enforced submission of other cultures , in the middle east and elsewhere , who had a tradition to think freely and invent new stuff , including libraries . 
  the barbarian anti-individuality , anti-emancipation , anti-liberty archaic namus mentality of the stone age arabian desert indeed put `` protecting '' the honor of the clan above anything else , in particular above the freedom , self-determination , dignity of the human being . 
  this is the evil core of namus mentality , for which islam is used as a cloak . 
  in any crime there is an objective and a subjective side , so when i dress like a boar for mardi gras and you shoot me assuming you shoot a boar , it is not homicide . 
  there is no special exception whatsoever concerning sexual abuse of a child , and i find it both disingenuous and dangerous to suggest so . 
  i do not know what kind of people you have around yourself , but in the germany where i live sexual abuse of children is neither `` somehow accepted '' nor `` kinda common '' . 
  sexual acts with a child younger than 14 is always the crime of sexual abuse of a child in germany , irrespective of circumstances or `` consent '' of whomever . 
  the fdp argues for a canada-style immigration law ( which has nothing to do with refugees ) in germany since 2002 . 
  increasing parts of the spd show sympathy for it for some years now , i heard such voices for the first time around 2010 . 
  the afd copied the idea of a canada-style immigration law into its program when founding in 2013 ( which has a somewhat funny aspect , as their arguments are rather for an australia-style immigration law ) . 
  that is the facts . 
  of course the economic dimension of mass migration is a challenge in any case . 
  however , the social dimension of a cultural heterogenity shock is a second , unrelated challenge . 
  and collier ( and i agree with him ) considers this second challenge much more grave and harder to master than the first . 
  so i would agree with him that one should focus on the first , necessary challenge while avoiding the second , unnecessary challenge . 
  means adressing the issue in the home region of the refugees . 
   one in four people in lebanon and one in ten in jordan currently is a refugee , how are these countries supposed to take even more of this ? 
  collier ( as pretty much all serious scholars of migration ) bases his arguments on the fact that cultural/social self-identification/affinity matters very much . 
  ideologes of `` multicultural '' utopia do not want to hear that , and this is what perverts much of public discourse in germany . 
  in fact , germany without much problem absorbed 14 million ethnically cleansed germans after the second world war , and if all 7 million austrians would emigrate to germany in 2016 , the challenge would be managable . 
  the same thing goes for syrians in jordan or lebanon . 
   i wish smartasses like him would propose how the eu can become like canada . 
  this is for example the program of the fdp party in germany for more than a decade , recently spd and afd move into that direction of transparent and sincere immigration policies as well . 
  problem is that both the cdu/csu and the greens reject that path , because transparent and sincere immigration policies do not fit their ideological agenda . 
  actually we will need a federal government without cdu/csu and without greens to get a reasonable immigration policy . 
  as you see , this has nothing to do with `` left '' or `` right '' , but with enlightened reason versus ideological self-indulgence and self-righteousness . 
  translation of submission  die welt : currently , 60 million people are on the run , as many as never before since the second world war . 
  nevertheless , to warn you that this exodus may be only the beginning . 
  why ? 
   paul collier : one has to distinguish clearly . 
  in this refugee crisis , we on the one hand deal with failed states like syria . 
  the people who flee from there , it 's about survival . 
  here we are talking of about 14 million people . 
  and then there are those who live in poor countries and make their way to the rich western world , in order to find their happiness . 
  these are hundreds of millions of people . 
  a huge mass that once on the move is hardly controllable .
