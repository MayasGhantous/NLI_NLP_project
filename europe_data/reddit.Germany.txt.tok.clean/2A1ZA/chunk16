  canada taking about only 25,000 syrians - and only families , no unaccompanied young men . 
  that way , many of the problems europe complains about now do not arise . 
  can we make a deal ? 
  we quickly annex you , and klaus iohannis becomes chancellor of the united entity instead of angela merkel ? 
  if and when police takes a role to communicate publicly for political purposes , as they did in this case , they have to do it right . 
  they chose to forgo the option not to make any public statement , and thus they were under an obligation to do their politically motivated communication professionally and properly . 
  and concerning the interest of the victim , the ( incorrect ! ), 
  public impression caused by the initial police statements that the girl `` fabricated '' everything is at least as damaging to her as the facts of the investigation as we know them now . 
  as you obviously do not know the german law , i invite you to read it . 
  `` vergewaltigung '' ( `` rape '' ) is not a separate crime , but just a special case of `` sexuelle n\u00f6tigung '' ( `` sexual assault '' ) which includes penetration of the body . 
  and it can be done by abuse of incapability as well , no physical force or threat of physical force needed . 
  and police did not say `` that they are investigating for sexual child abuse '' until a week later . 
  for a week , the public statements of the police were generally understood as saying `` there was no problem at all , it is all fabricated '' . 
  even the federal government picked up the line . 
  with sincere communication from the outset , there would never have been an issue . 
  here is a good german language article how misleading public statements by the police ( and subsequently by the federal government ) messed things up : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/angebliche-vergewaltigung-unser-maedchen-kommentar-a-1074048.html, 
  of course all choices are made in a context , but there is no `` pressure '' up to the point of `` only have one option '' in our open society , and people can choose and change their contexts to suit them , too . 
  all around me , including my family , all of my life and where ever i have been , the most diverse individual choices concerning relationships and sexuality have been made out of free will , and people are happy with it . 
  sorry that you have never been to europe or america , or other places of the civilised world , you might give it a try to travel there on occasion . 
  you will be surprised to learn that indivudual self-determination means that everybody chooses for themselves how much they value one night stands , long term relationships , and all the other stuff concerning relationships and sexuality . 
  and you will find that different people make all kinds of choices for themselves . 
   muslim men do n't want ( ... ) their women to value ( ... ) well , the idea that `` muslim men '' decide what `` muslim women '' are supposed to value is indeed the opposite of indivudual self-determination . 
  in two respects : first that it introduces collective norms instead of individual choice , and then even suggest one collective to dictate the life of the other . 
  you are on the wrong side of history , dude . 
  i did not care about the issue either , but some days ago my social media timelines were full of `` government says : stupid nazis demonstrate against a case of child abuse that never happened '' . 
  and apparently this led to much irritation and disgust among the community of german immigrants from russia , where the victim stems from . 
  as we know now , with quite some good reason . 
  if the berlin police would have said that a week ago , instead of making misleading statements that were generally understood as `` there was no problem at all '' , and even the federal government picking up the line , then this would n't be an issue in public dabate .

  sure . 
  it only became an issue because the police made public statements about the case which were generally understood as saying `` there was no problem at all '' . 
  even the federal government picked that line up .

  the police did make public statements . 
  and as sex with a 13 year old per se constitutes a crime , whatever the circumstances and in particular even if the girl did not fight against it , the police can not simply say `` there was no problem '' , which they for whatever reason basically said in their public statements . 
  three men took a 13 year old girl with them for 30 hours , repeatedly had intercourse with her , she has a couple of haematomas and bruises , and all our berlin police has to say about it is `` no problem , we think it was consensual sex '' ? 
  13 is not even the legal age to consent . 
  where the hell are we , in a banana republic ? 
  * translation of submission *  ** suppression of kurdish culture - erdogan 's witch hunt against writers , journalists and academics **  for half a year since recep tayyip erdogan unilaterally terminated the peace negotiations with the pkk , war has been raging in the kurdish-populated areas . 
  the turkish army is reportedly still only up against pkk terrorists . 
  but doing so killed more than 200 civilians so far , women , children , old people . 
  many were wounded or lost all their belongings . 
  pictures of them are barely visible in the turkish media . 
   why ? 
  `` the state it prevents people from learning what is happening in the south-eastern turkey , '' says ugur g\u00fcc of the union of journalists turkey . 
  especially kurdish journalists constantly face broadcasting ban , censorship and harassment . 
  when a kurdish cameraman wants to report despite the censorship , he is discharged with a gun to his head . 
   ** the only pro-kurdish tv channel concerned for broadcasting license **  we visit the only pro-kurdish television station still allowed in turkey , imc . 
  via internet new video images from the war zone just arrive from their cameraman . 
  `` ambulance , ambulance '' screaming people , a man is seriously injured on the ground . 
  the cameraman records how civilians cover mountains of corpses of people killed with a white banner . 
   suddenly shots are fired , people running for their lives . 
  not all manage to escape the gunfire . 
  two people were killed , five wounded , including the cameraman . 
  the next day we read in the pro-government dailies : `` two terrorists neutralized . '', 
   `` we 're working under constant pressure state , '' says ey\u00fcp burc , program director of the imc . 
  `` even the state television council puts us under pressure . 
  if guests in our program say something that does not fit the state , we will be held accountable . 
  against us run several arbitrary legal proceedings , and we have repeatedly been condemned to pay heavy fines . 
  now we lwill perhaps even lose our broadcasting license . '', 
   ** pro-kurdish daily struggles for survival **  how mercilessly the state is going , you could see when the famous turkish showmaster beyaz took a live call from the kurdish city of diyarbakir . 
  one teacher said : `` children should not die . 
  look what 's happening here ! '', 
  the result : criminal investigations against both the caller and the showmaster - because of `` terrorist propaganda '' . 
   51 journalists of pro-kurdish dailies have been killed in the past twenty years . 
  30 of them worked for the largest pro-kurdish journal `` g\u00fcndem '' . 
  50 times it was forbidden , and 50 times it appeared under a new name . 
  giving up is out of question for them , even if today more than ten employees of `` g\u00fcndem '' are in turkish prisons and the sale of the newspaper is widely prevented . 
  `` if dozens of colleagues are killed , arrested or exiled , then you must certainly go on . 
  because if we do not report , then nobody will , '' says the chief editor ahmet g\u00fcndem birsin . 
   ** number of banned books increases **  not only journalists suffer from state harassment , also writers do . 
  even books written by turkish authors , who work for peace between turks and kurds , one searches in vain in the shelves . 
  `` lately , the number of banned books increased extremely , '' said a salesman . 
  `` and among them are more and more books with kurdish issues . '', 
   however , other books are legally available , although they call for violence - such as `` the provisions of the jihadists '' . 
  the book includes advice for islamists : `` infidel women who are taken prisoner during the war may be kept as sex slaves . '', 
  printed by permission of the turkish ministry of culture and provided with an isbn number . 
   ** academics protest **  against the turkish policy of war and human rights abuses , more than 2,000 academics have now protested and signed an appeal for peace . 
  prompt came the response from president erdogan himself : `` here we see treason by the so-called scientists , while the majority receive their salary from the state and concerning their quality of life are living better than the average citizen . '', 
   prosecutors responded to the call of their president : 21 academics arrested , 30 dismissed . 
  the dean of the university of istanbul 's famous galatasaray has signed . 
  and fears reprisals : `` we have only supported a peace campaign . 
  many of my colleagues have been taken away by the police as criminals and treated as terrorists . 
  it is wrong and not tp understand . 
  i am just speechless . '', 
   whether by journalists , writers or academics - criticism is stifled and declared a terrorist propaganda . 
  turkey is increasingly becoming a country of oppression and fear . 
  how long will the west look the other way ? 
  actually all problems we usually associate with islam are in fact problems with an archaically perverted attitude of overwhelming denial , shame and violence with respect to sexuality based on the barbarian namus ethics of clan and honor from the stone age arabian desert . 
  the one thing the `` islamic world '' needs is a revolution of sexual liberation and indivudual self-determination , everything else will get fine after that . 
  if i recall correctly , you wrote here on reddit that you await your conscription for the turkish army . 
  so maybe after experiencing the war most immediately yourself in person , you will not cheer narcissistic warmongering any longer , will not try to defame those who seek fair and realistic pathways to fair and sustainable peace as alleged `` terrorists '' any more . 
  these two illustrative videos ( same event ) show isis-like erdogan `` security forces '' in their campaign against anything secular , anything kurdish and in particular anything secular kurdish in southeast turkey , copying all the isis chants to annihilate kurds . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db2fx_hlx9k https://twitter.com/agirecudi/status/666575246099619840 and here is coverage of the recent * amnesty international * report . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/amnesty-turkish-army-operations-beginning-to-resemble-collective-punishment.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=94134&amp;newscatid=339  the turkish military operations backed by curfews in the country 's southeast have begun to resemble `` collective punishment , '' amnesty international said on jan. 20 , also accusing the international community of poor criticism against turkey . 
  ( ... ) `` operations by police and the military in these areas have been characterized by abusive use of force , including firing heavy weaponry in residential neighborhoods , '' the group said in a report . 
  `` there is little doubt that the turkish authorities are putting lives at risk by using lethal force excessively and recklessly , '' it added . 
  http://www.todayszaman.com/national_amnesty-says-onslaught-in-southeast-puts-200000-lives-at-risk_410214.html  `` the operations currently being conducted under round-the-clock curfews are putting the lives of tens of thousands of people at risk and are beginning to resemble collective punishment . '' ( ... ) `` while the turkish authorities appear determined to silence internal criticism , they have faced very little from the international community . 
  strategic considerations ( ... ) must not overshadow allegations of gross human rights violations . 
  the international community must not look the other way . '',
