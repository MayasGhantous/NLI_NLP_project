  and the pkk is progressive in these terms and the akp-regime in turkey is anti-progressive . 
  in terms of terror as a method , i would not see the pkk to be worse than the akp-regime . 
  this article , too , does not give any source for allegedly `` the pkk '' being behind this . 
  there is neither any evidence for that nor any discernable motivation for `` the pkk '' to do such a thing . 
  and the fact that `` the pkk '' has very much constrained any attacks on so called `` security forces '' of the clepto-islamist erdogan regime for years is a strong argument against `` the pkk '' being behind this . 
  it is as least as plausible that the isis-like erdogan `` security forces '' in their genocidal campaign against anything secular , anything kurdish and in particular anything secular kurdish in southeast turkey might be behind it .

  you are obviously much closer to and apologetic towards the policies of the clepto-islamist akp policies than i could ever be towards policies of anyone under the kck umbrella of the progressive kurdish movement ( which includes pkk ) . 
  i am aware that you probably do not vote for the akp , however in countless reddit comments you display association with the crowd that in political language would be called `` useful idiots '' of the akp . 
   but you akp people justify the death of secular kurds to reach greater cause . 
  ftfy here is two videos of the isis-like erdogan `` security forces '' in their genocidal campaign against anything secular , anything kurdish and in particular anything secular kurdish in southeast turkey . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db2fx_hlx9k https://twitter.com/agirecudi/status/666575246099619840 and here is coverage of yesterday 's * amnesty international * report . 
   it 's evidence nonetheless . 
  no , an unsourced , implausible and baseless claim is not `` evidence '' , and even less so if it is made by the * daily sabah * . 
   yes i hate erdogan and he 's a disgusting dictator equal to putin . 
  but in what universe does that make killing children okay ? 
  what makes you think that i would condone the strategic killing of the children of random secular kurdish parents by erdogan 's `` security forces '' in the southeast ? 
  i am deeply appalled by that , and i criticise it at any occasion .

  your `` evidence '' is an unsourced , implausible and baseless claim by the * daily sabah * ? 
  my ass . 
  no wonder there is a campaign to harass and imprison any sincere academic and any sincere journalist in erdogan 's turkey , because otherwise this low level of discourse simply is not possible . 
  `` the pkk '' has very much constrained any attacks on so called `` security forces '' of the clepto-islamist erdogan regime and not attacked any civilian institution like a school for many years , and you know that very well . 
  it is no coincidence that the proponents of a genocide against anything secular , anything kurdish and in particular anything secular kurdish in turkey so desperately try to find any single event which they can portray `` the pkk '' to attack a target they should not attack . 
  why do you believe this was done by `` the pkk '' ? 
  there is neither any evidence for that nor any discernable motivation for `` the pkk '' to do such a thing . 
  and the fact that `` the pkk '' has very much constrained any attacks on so called `` security forces '' of the clepto-islamist erdogan regime for years is a strong argument against `` the pkk '' being behind this . 
  notable that the clepto-islamist erdogan regime mouthpiece * daily sabah * reports the repulsive act as done by `` the pkk '' , although there is neither any evidence for that nor any discernable motivation for `` the pkk '' to do such a thing . 
  no wonder that independent turkish media , or what is left of those , do not make the absurd claim : http://www.todayszaman.com/latest-news_explosion-hits-school-in-diyarbakir-wounds-5-students_410309.html but it does not really surprise that all those who wish to incite hatred and advocate genocide against anything secular , anything kurdish and in particular anything secular kurdish in turkey abuse the event to promote their agenda . 
  from an educational perspective , just a handful of kornet atgms in the hands of pkk respective ydg-h might vastly improve mr. erdogan 's understanding of the humanist concept of human rights and human dignity . 
  one major difference is that in southeast turkey in 2016 , the rebels are secular and the regime is islamist . 
  preferring the secular , modern republic of mustafa kemal pasha , which took turkey into the champions league of nations , over the anachronistic , clepto-islamist sultanism of the current regime is now called `` anti-turkic '' by erdogan fanboys ? 
  my ass . 
  does the regime already have concrete plans to transfer the honorary title `` atat\u00fcrk '' to sayyid qutb and to officially define the bedouin way of life as the new , erdoganist essence of turkishness ? 
  there is one armed opposition group , the sdf , that is non-islamist , that gets weapons from nato , but the sdf is ** not ** bombed by russia . 
  the only actors that really hate the sdf are the clepto-islamist regimes in saudi arabia , qatar and turkey . 
  i wrote about the sdf here in this thread just two hours ago . 
   the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , with their nucleus in the secular , progressive rojava administration ( and its ypg/j defence forces ) , are non-islamist and anti-islamist . 
  they are progressive even by european standards . 
  but i agree with you that they are pretty much the only non-islamist armed opposition in syria , and they are in hot or cold war with all the islamists .

  i am as anti-putin as it gets , but your claim is nonsense . 
  those `` rebel '' groups russia is bombing in syria are all hardcore jihadi islamists , and of course they are not `` given weapons by nato '' , but are armed by the clepto-islamist regimes of saudi arabia , qatar and , sad to say , turkey , which is a shame for a nato member , but that does not make nato as an organisation responsible for the maverick islamist agenda of the akp regime in turkey . 
  the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , with their nucleus in the secular , progressive rojava administration ( and its ypg/j defence forces ) , are non-islamist and anti-islamist .

  the clepto-islamist akp regime in turkey is not an ethnicity ( or did i miss something and mr. erdogan is megalomanic enough to claim his own ethnicity ? 
  ) , but a bunch of deeply corrupted politicians from the islamist milieu who abuse both islam and the totalitarian political ideology of islamism to foster their personal financial and narcissistic desires by creating havoc in the whole of the middle east . 
  arguably most human suffering in the middle east would simply not exist without the akp policies . 
  if you are interested in some in-depth , try these links for a start : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3kqf19/the_politicalideological_differences_between/cuzx9uu, 
  the barbarian mess the majority elected clepto-islamist regime in turkey created in syria , all over the middle east and not least in turkey 's own southeast , is the cause for most of the contemporary human sufferuing in the region , including the refugee crises . 
  this behavior must not be accepted or even rewarded , it must be punished , and perceived as being punished in the public . 
  if measures taken towards turkey are publicly perceived in turkey as `` a punishment '' for the barbarian mess their majority elected clepto-islamist regime created in syria , all over the middle east and not least in turkey 's own southeast , even better . 
  punishment for bad behavior is the right way . 
  great statement by the us ambassador to turkey , john bass :  we are seeing reports of academics being investigated and subject to penalties for expressing their opinions about the conflict in the southeast . 
  while we may not agree with the opinions expressed by those academics , we are nevertheless concerned about this pressure having a chilling effect on legitimate political discourse across turkish society regarding the sources and solutions to the ongoing violence . 
  in democratic societies it is imperative that citizens have the opportunity to express their views , even controversial and unpopular ones . 
   expressions of concern about violence do not equal support for terrorism . 
  criticism of government does not equal treason . 
  turkish democracy is strong enough and resilient enough to embrace free expression and uncomfortable ideas . 
  i wish that our eu institutions would speak up as sincerely and clearly as mr. bass does . 
  the interview with lara logan on * cbs 60 minutes * on what she had to experience in her `` taharrush '' assault at tahir square in cairo in 2011 is really impressing . 
  if you do not know it yet , watch it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo12x1nhzzk only since cologne , international media pick up the `` taharrush '' phenomenon ( women in public places being surrounded by groups of men and sexually assaulted ) as a broader issue . 
  tl ; dr  twenty four-hour curfews have been declared since 11 december in the sur district of the city of diyarbak\u0131r , and since 14 december in the towns of cizre and silopi , in \u015e\u0131rnak province , south eastern turkey . 
  the curfews have been put in place as the police and army conduct operations against the armed revolutionary patriotic youth movement . 
  more than 200,000 people live in the affected areas and some are unable to access food , medical care and face severe electricity and water shortages . 
  more than 70 residents and at least seven soldiers and police officers have been reported killed . 
  on the same topic , * hurriyet daily news * has a good report `` chp delegation paints a dire picture of diyarbak\u0131r '' . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/chp-delegation-paints-a-dire-picture-of-diyarbakir.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=93759&amp;newscatid=338  `` the view we have seen tore our hearts out . 
  although a curfew has been officially declared in six neighborhoods , it de facto exists in 15 neighborhoods . 
  we were able to enter sur but we could only walk 200 meters on the main street . 
  under such conditions , health services can not be offered . 
  these days after curfews have been declared for the last 40 days , people are left hungry and without health services , '' kara said . 
  `` there are heavy violations of the right to life and serious defects in reaching health services . 
  ( ... )  `` there is a serious emotional disengagement among people . 
  a lot of people we met said , ` we are under intense pressure . 
  turkey is otherizing us . ' however , the main danger is about the new generation . 
  according to what we have been told , those who have guns in their hands now are people who were children during the 1990s . 
  if these clashes prolong , a return path will be closed and no communication with the new generation will be possible in any way . 
  because children raised under these conditions will grow up with feelings of revenge and hatred , '' kara said . 
  and there is a readworthy comment `` turkey loses its mind '' in * today 's zaman * . 
  http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist/suat-kiniklioglu/turkey-loses-its-mind_409464.html  more worrying to me is the lack of empathy on the turkish side to the plight of our kurdish citizens . 
  turkey 's west has turned a blind eye to the events in the southeast . 
  the turkish media does not report about the operations in a transparent manner . 
  those who try to are arrested or taken into custody . 
  the ugliest side of the region 's history has re-emerged . 
  the losing of turkey 's conscience , the violation of our most human feelings and the lack of a proper reaction to what is going on in the southeast will be remembered as a key milestone in the gradual division of this country . 
   what an irony it is that a country that is obsessed about its unity in such a fashion destroys that very unity by its own follies . 
  i am afraid that 2015 and onwards will be remembered as a turning point in the kurdish issue because more and more kurds seem to feel seriously alienated from the rest of the country . 
   name me one islamic law in turkey ? 
  as elaborated above , the issue of islamism is the question of the source of legitimacy ( `` allah or man '' ) , not any particular law ( laws per se are neutral , it is at best complex or in most cases outright impossible to attribute the ideological background to the wording of any law ) . 
  however , just for an impression of how the republic of turkey is being transformed into a dark islamist place , take this quote :  not as long as turkey has a president who works to assassinate the secular republic of turkey . 
  by setting imam hatip schools in the path of becoming the norm for all pupils in the long run . 
  by rallying with a quran and defaming competitors as `` bad muslims '' . 
  by calling on his supporters to carry the banner of islam to jerusalem . 
  by claiming that columbus found a mosque on cuba ( i.e. 
  claiming all america is `` islamic lands '' ) . 
  by forcing sunni islam school education on every child .
