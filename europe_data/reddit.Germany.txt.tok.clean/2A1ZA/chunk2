  to apply for political asylum in germany , you must physically be within the territory of the federal republic of germany . 
  most of the group concerned here would not be granted visa today , on economic background grounds . 
  and i underline * federal republic * of germany , because the reason for the political persecution of these people in turkey , and the reason for you to call them `` terrorists '' , is their alleged association with the desire that turkey should become a federal republic not unlike germany . 
  \u00d6calan is not factual leader of anything , he is imprisoned in solitary confinement for 17 years . 
  however , he is revered as the representative figure by all of the transnational progressive kurdish movement under the kck umbrella . 
  demanding that revering \u00d6calan must be taboo is factually the same thing as demanding that debate on the kurdish issue must be shut down . 
  if that is what you want , then of course your demand makes sense . 
  however , i 'd consider that aim not only inacceptable from a european values and european autochthonous minority rights point of view , i 'd also consider that aim stupid for anyone who cares for the republic of turkey , because this aim of silencing debate works to destroy said republic . 
  there is an excellent * carnegie * piece on the issue , [ the looming eu-turkey visa drama ] ( http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/?fa=63485 ) . 
  in my humble opinion , it is a mistake to allow for visa-free travel with turkey before all 72 objective criteria are fully met . 
  three arguments : ( 1 ) diluting the 72 objective criteria for visa-free travel to the eu , in this case with turkey , would do horrendous damage both to visa negotiations with other countries and to negotiantions with turkey about other issues . 
  ( 2 ) the ongoing razing of cities and ethnic cleansing in turkey 's southeast ( `` anti-terror-operations '' ) would probably at this point of time make at least half a million ethnic kurdish citizens of turkey eligible for political asylum in germany . 
  ( 3 ) after 14 years of akp/erdogan rule , turkey is infested with hardcore islamists , both of salafi jihadi strain ( including many isis cells ) and of the , even more dangerous in my opinion , muslim brotherhood islamism-meets-fascism strain . 
  in the * federation of north syria - rojava * , the `` apoists '' of the progressive kurdish movement kck ( which seeks not independence but modern federalism , under the concept of `` democratic confederalism '' ) have the space to demonstrate what their political attitude and agenda is about . 
  can read about the process from journalists who went there : [ a dream of secular utopia in isis ' backyard ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/a-dream-of-utopia-in-hell.html ) new york times 11/2015 [ american leftists need to pay more attention to rojava ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/11/25/rojava_is_a_radical_experiment_in_democracy_in_northern_syria_american_leftists.html ) slate 11/2015 [ the kurds ' democratic experiment ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/opinion/the-kurds-democratic-experiment.html ) new york times 09/2015 [ the revolution in rojava ] ( https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-revolution-in-rojava ) dissent 04/2015 [ the rojava revolution ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/arab-awakening/evangelos-aretaios/rojava-revolution ) opendemocracy 03/2015 [ statement from the academic delegation to rojava ] ( http://new-compass.net/articles/statement-academic-delegation-rojava ) new compass 01/2015 [ this is a genuine revolution ] ( https://zcomm.org/znetarticle/no-this-is-a-genuine-revolution/ ) znet 12/2014 [ why is the world ignoring the revolutionary kurds in syria ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/08/why-world-ignoring-revolutionary-kurds-syria-isis ) the guardian 10/2014, 
  the secular , progressive revolution and modernisation of kurdish societies initiated and personified by abdullah \u00d6calan `` serok apo '' and the transnational kck umbrella probably is the best thing that happened to the middle east since mustafa kemal pasha did the same thing with turkish society and founded the secular republic of turkey which akp/erdogan now are in the process of burying . 
  however , apparently islamist akp and hdp fight in the parliament now on a regular basis . 
  another event three days ago :  fighting erupted after hdp \u015e\u0131rnak deputy ferhat enc\u00fc `` commemorated all civilians and children massacred by the security services . '' `` i remember the civilians recently massacred by shelling in [ the southeastern district of ] silopi . 
  i remember the 34 people , including children , who were brutally bombed by turkish warplanes in roboski four years ago , '' said enc\u00fc . 
  the point is that every sustainable consensual coexistence necessarily needs a willingness to mental `` normalisation '' . 
  as palestinian arab society still overwhelmingly and categorically refuses mental `` normalisation '' ( i.e. 
  recognizing the existence if israel as a legitimate fact of life ) , i can not blame israel for seeking robust arrangements that work without consent from the palestinian arab society . 
  palestinian arab society could perfectly demonstrate their willingness to sustainable consensual coexistence by choosing to pursue a policy of developing gaza ( which israel totally left alone in 2005 ) into an arab singapore at the mediterranean instead of a base for [ eternal war against israel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0diqro_49m ) ( the blockade was only implemented after they [ chose the latter ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2m_gy-rd_s ) in 2007 ) . 
  once they would make this decision , i would find a re-evaluation of policy justified . 
  but not a day earlier . 
   if turkey actually gets it 's economical act together turkey more then anything else must get its open society act , its liberty act , its democracy act , its rule of law act , together . 
  only then can those dreams move towards reality . 
  absolutely . 
  the people working in these magazines are brave men and women at the frontline in defence of civilization . 
  take a look at http://www.palwatch.org/ and know that unconditional support for israel , including hard positions , is the only sensible foreign policy towards the region . 
  only after palestinian arab society has overcome its deep rooted narcissistic eliminatory hate of anything israel can foreign policy think about moving on . 
  what do you think about the argument that diluting the 72 objective criteria for visa-free travel to the eu , in this case with turkey , would do horrendous damage both to visa negotiations with other countries and to negotiantions with turkey about other issues ? 
  what do you think about the argument that the ongoing razing of cities and ethnic cleansing in turkey 's southeast ( `` anti-terror-operations '' ) would probably at this point of time make at least half a million ethnic kurdish citizens of turkey eligible for political asylum in germany ? 
  what do you think about the argument that after 14 years of akp/erdogan rule , turkey is infested with hardcore islamists , both of salafi jihadi strain ( including many isis cells ) and of the , even more dangerous in my opinion , * muslim brotherhood * islamism-meets-fascism strain ? 
  the language which you employ in your [ whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) is beautiful like s\u00fcmeyye , rich like bilal and tender like the loin of tayyip . 
  as to my knowledge , those `` orthodox communities across turkey '' would wish to ( re ) build and ( re ) open their own churches , not have the government expropriate and run their churches . 
  by the way , the * guardian * had a [ readworthy article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/09/destruction-sur-turkey-historic-district-gentrification-kurdish ) some weeks ago on that idea of razing cities in the name of `` fight against terror '' and then expropriating the real estate and building a different city . 
  oh , is this the same `` orthodox communities across turkey '' whose churches in amed/diyarbakir and elsewhere just were expropriated some weeks ago ? 
  on the topic of bankruptcy : smart position is that clear , effective and efficient rules and procedures should be implemented for the case of a bankruptcy of a eurozone member state . 
  i fully support that position , and so does , if with insufficient vigor in my opinion , the german government . 
  ( however , i do not know of anyone who thinks `` personal and corporate bankruptcy should be abolished '' . 
  how did you make up that issue ? ), 
  on the topic of 500-euro-notes , i have written more than once in this subreddit that abolishing them is a step in the wrong direction . 
  antalya voted majority akp . 
  sorry , but i can not feel empathy for the tourism industry there . 
  they just deserve the boycott until erdogan leaves office . 
  and such boycott now , for as long as erdogan is in office , is the best way to advance the path towards a stable , a sane and secular turkey that can be our partner . 
  the us produced an explosion in their public debt for this temporary upsurge in gdp . 
  the more sincere and sustainable path of the eu now starts to pay off in comparison , and the wisdom of the european policy will become even more obvious once the interest on public debt rises again . 
  yes , ireland did better than spain and spain did better than greece with overcoming the `` stickiness of wages '' . 
  to be honest , as someone who has followed economics for decades , i had tears of joy in my eyes when i read how the good people of ireland some years ago did what was said it could not be done . 
  in your face , mr bewley . 
  the terminology you use here was definitely not commonly used when i studied that stuff at university 20 years ago . 
  the `` keynesian '' terminology i quoted above was still most commonly used , both in german and anglo-saxon universities . 
  i am glad that the dark and wrong keynesian path has been buried also in terminology since . 
  however , here i talked to a user who obviously used the keynesian concept of `` deflation '' . 
  markets do not work smoothly , there is no disagreement about that . 
  our disagreement is on the question if concrete state interventionism does more to mitigate or to create inefficiencies . 
  and you did not offer any argument to support your naive enthusiasm for each and every state interventionism . 
  while trying to pretend being an academic in economics , you might want to use the correct term `` field '' or `` discipline '' instead of the incorrect term `` area '' , as it might make your story more plausible . 
   the problem with negative inflation is that it leads to lower demand are you actually suggesting that when the restaurant across the street lower their prices , and the apple shop next door lower their prices , i would demand and consume less ? 
  not really . 
   markets do not work like in micro yes , they do . 
  i do not believe in the ideology of `` fiscal stimulus '' . 
  and by the way , i do not see a problem with negative inflation , apparently we have managed to overcome the keynesian problem of `` stickiness of wages '' . 
  in traditional `` keynesianism '' - infested terminology , which you apparently use , the opposite of `` inflation '' ( rise in the general price level ) is `` disinflation '' ( fall in the general price level ) . 
  this is the figure your first link provides , and that was reported for the eurozone today . 
  in traditional `` keynesianism '' - infested terminology , which you apparently use , `` deflation '' is a much more complex concept , which builds on the assumption of `` stickiness of wages '' and working from this assumption proclaims that disinflation would lead to contraction in the real economy ( you somewhat describe that in your comment ) . 
  however , this problem is pretty simple to overcome by overcoming the `` stickiness of wages '' issue . 
  and exactly this has happened in many european crisis countries ( ireland being the most shining positive example ) . 
  to illustrate the point , today the eurozone reports disinflation and a doubling of real economic growth at the same time . 
  yes , a public debtor with currency sovereignty can con his creditors by printing money . 
  but creditors do not like that , and this public debtor entity will have to pay ever higher interest . 
  not wanting to have to pay this ever higher interest was a major reason for many countries to wish for a currency union . 
  who ever wants to leave the currency union , go back to conning creditors and pay high interest , is welcome to do that . 
  by `` deflation '' you obviously mean `` disinflation '' , the opposite of `` inflation '' , right ? 
  it is reported to be a mere 0,2 percent disinflation , with 0,8 percent inflation in the core . 
  by the way , what exactly is your problem with goods and services getting nominally cheaper for the people ? 
  policies of insincerity , of deficit spending and ever growing public debt , such policies never result in sustainable growth , they only result in potemkin `` growth '' as a temporary gift from satan that is bitterly regretted in the inevitably following next crisis which they necessarily induce . 
  and the good thing is : europe 's economy is on a more sincere and thus solid foundation than it ever was . 
  those policies of economic and financial sincerity , often called `` austerity '' , not only prepared the field for sustainable growth and prosperity , they also minimize the risk of gravity for any future crisis . 
  did you read the article submitted here , or do you just feel the usual urge to answer every comment i make on reddit ? 
  once you actually read the article , you will find out that the `` insulting majesty '' competition in akp-turkey is elaborated there , and an erdogan cartoon perfectly suits and contributes to this conversation . 
  looking down my reddit timeline , i only very rarely find erdogan cartoons from the great subreddits r/insultingerdogan and r/operationstreisand linked by me . 
  but as you so nicely ask me to make it a habit , i will consider it . 
  interesting `` insulting majesty '' competition in akp-turkey these days . 
  what will more likely get me a prison term , linking a cartoon of [ mr erdogan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sgwj0yi.jpg ) or linking a cartoon of [ mr mohammed ] ( http://www.amnation.com/vfr/muhammad%20cartoon.jpg ) ? 
  any experts for criminal law in turkey around ? 
  and question to the erdogan crowd among the audience , for linking which of the two cartoons do you think i should be imprisoned longer ? 
   hate speech laws you consider [ this cartoon ] ( https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/bn-gk083_charli_jv_20150112182529.jpg ) published by charlie hebdo after the massacre , which the turkish journalists in our case did illustrate their articles with , to be `` hate speech '' ? 
  really ? 
  funny how jewels like this submission get downvoted by people who only read the headline . 
   the awful truth for the leave campaign is that the governing establishment of the entire western world views brexit as strategic vandalism . 
  and rightly so . 
  i appreciate your idea of giving more attention to the byzantine heritage of europe . 
  however , if we want muslim turkey to apologize and pay compensation for the sacking of constantinople in 1453 , we should demand the same from catholic italy for the sacking of constantinople in 1204 . 
  and we should amend the eu treaty that the chairman of the commission must be born in purple . 
  i do think that technically the aim of a special treaty relationship of turkey with the eu would make more sense than obsession with regular membership , for a multitude of reasons . 
  however , i very much appreciate every reorientation of the republic of turkey towards the civilized world .
