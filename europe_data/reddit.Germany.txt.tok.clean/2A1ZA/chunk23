  as i assume that you speak german , look at this video of an emancipatory sibel kekilli speech in bellevue in march this year . 
  my favorite political speech of 2015 . 
  in your worldview , would you consider this speech `` right '' or `` left '' ? 
  here is a shortened version of the original french article on the website of * marianne * http://www.marianne.net/saint-denis-ma-ville-heure-islamiste-100238075.html, 
  ** saint-denis : how my city became islamist ** * fewzi benhabib once fled algeria islamists to saint-denis . 
  today the city is unrecognizable , he writes , islamists had conquered streets and shops : report of a stunned . 
  * for 21 years i live in saint-denis . 
  here , a few kilometers from paris , i have found asylum in 1994 . 
  my friend , professor abderrahmane fardeheb , was assassinated on september 26 of that year in oran in front of his daughter , whom he had accompanied to school , by islamists . 
  at that time i had decided to leave my country . 
  in saint-denis , this situated on the river seine city of diversity , hospitality and tolerance , i could be at home with my family , finally free from the threats of the islamists , who piled up in my mailbox . 
  i was 48 years old and left a beloved radiant city where i had worked as a physicist and taught - full of pain , but convinced that i would no longer be exposed to the horrors of political islam in france . 
  in recent years , the fear grabbed me again . 
  saint-denis has nothing to do with the saint-denis at the time . 
  and the land of human rights refuses to look . 
  in saint-denis , a gap has opened up , which brings back memories , it does so on the sidewalks , in the market on sunday . 
  and yet many citizens refuse to recognize that here gnaws a counter-project to the democratic foundations of the pluralistic society . 
  * veil for a four-year old * where , in this downright summery sunday of november , are lightweight tops and short skirts ? 
  wherever i look , veil , veil , veil again - simple headscarves , shawls , also cover the forehead , and great for the whole body . 
  recently , there in the street that bears the name of the communist resistance fighter gabriel p\u00e9ri , shops for islamic dress . 
  they are called duba\u00ef center or daffah - a thriving saudi company . 
  this is the law of supply and demand , which is bad about it ? , ask the naive , to whom i can no longer count myself . 
  my wife asks naively : `` do you have a scarf for my eight year old granddaughter who is small for her age , '' the shop assistant shows her models : `` i 've sold one to a four year old . '', 
  in between are books , they convey , together with the `` wahhabi fashion '' , the proselytism of an islamist fringe group , whose ideology many keep out of weakness or ignorance , for the message of the qur ` an . 
  this aims to hold `` muslims '' in the islamist orbit , dominate and control the community , to promote the secession from the rest of society . 
  in addition to the giant fast-food business mak d'hal , that mimics the look and mcdonald 's hamburgers , one hundred percent halal , the hair salon coiffure mixte is hardly noticeable . 
  the owner explained to me : `` mixte is here that there is a separate room for veiled women , where they are hidden from view . '', 
  this woman is like me from oran . 
  i say : `` how did this idea come from ? 
  i have not even seen such a thing in oran . '', 
  then the hairdresser : `` you will probably not compare oran and saint-denis . '', 
  here in saint-denis , she told me that muslims would live their faith without compromise . 
  how often have i not heard that lately ? 
  friends of mine come back in disbelief from algerian cities like algiers or s\u00e9tif . 
  `` in the market of bab-el-oued lovers hold hands !, 
  '' , a friend told me , as if he had seen an english speaking duck . 
  `` women who have a drink on a cafe terrace with girlfriends , they are normal , here we would wonder about it , '' complains another . 
  french people who recognize my origins from my appearance and accent , ask me : `` and , you eat pork ? 
  '' , as that would be weird . 
  i do not ask neighbors or colleagues whether they fast or go to the latin mass !, 
  why does one lock me in a cage of religious identity ? 
  when my daughter-in-law filed for her daughter at school , she crossed to the canteens questionnaire , the child eat `` everything '' . 
  a few days after the start of school , a supervisor adressed her : `` you know that you have by having everything ticked , agreed that your daughter eats foods that are not halal ? '', 
  my city has re-instilled in me in recent years the suspicion that i wanted to leave on the other side of the mediterranean sea 21 years ago . 
  the stream of people that every friday pours into the rue de boulangerie is not an ordinary gathering of believers . 
  from the tawhid-center that attracts so many believers that their prayer rugs temporarily brought the traffic brought to a standstill , in 2000 the preacher tariq ramadan launched his france-activity . 
  this prayer room , which some consider to be a simple mosque , is the center of those who follow the political ideology of the muslim brotherhood . 
  i am in france , i go on a road that still daresto call itself rue du jambon , street of ham . 
  i approach a newly opened bookstore , and despair . 
  in the display are posters that teach children islamic rules , such that you can not mock others , rest on the right side and make three breaks while drinking . 
  on the book tables you see the celebrities of the political islam , hani and tariq ramadan , as well as the historical figureheads of the muslim brotherhood , sayyid qutb and hassan al-bana . 
  * music , says an imam , is for pigs * all this reminds me uncannily to the oran of the1990s , when the islamist city government as a first measure closed the conservatory , forbade music and dance and condemned art as an imported sin . 
  was not an imam filmed in the brittany town of brest a few weeks ago , when he told his small pupils , music is made for apes and pigs ? 
  when the extreme right related organization civitas organized a conference against the gender theory , the security service was not organized as conservative catholics but of the bearded men of the tawhid-center that are equally hostile towards marriage for all . 
  how many such incidents will it take to open the eyes of the leftists of saint-denis ? 
  at the institute of technology of saint-denis , a stone 's throw from the hair salon coiffure mixte away , a student organization has called for that lecture times shall not fall into the prayer times . 
  because he dared to remember the values of the republic , the institute director became the victim of a brutal campaign of intimidation , received threatening letters , his car was damaged , he was beaten . 
  what do the police do ? 
  where is the political left ? 
  in the nineties , i saw my fellow algerian citizens equally helpless in the face of enormous intellectual and logistic machinery of algerian islamists . 
  islamism came treading softly , with small , successive audacities , initially very keen not to scare anyone - to finally plunge into terror and barbarism . 
  * from fewzi benhabib ( the press ) ` this article was published on monday in the french left magazine `` marianne '' , two days before the anti-terrorism mission in saint-denis in connection with the terrorist attacks on 13 november . 
  translated and shortened has him anne-catherine simon .
