  when my daughter-in-law filed for her daughter at school , she crossed to the canteens questionnaire , the child eat `` everything '' . 
  a few days after the start of school , a supervisor adressed her : `` you know that you have by having everything ticked , agreed that your daughter eats foods that are not halal ? '', 
  my city has re-instilled in me in recent years the suspicion that i wanted to leave on the other side of the mediterranean sea 21 years ago . 
  the stream of people that every friday pours into the rue de boulangerie is not an ordinary gathering of believers . 
  from the tawhid-center that attracts so many believers that their prayer rugs temporarily brought the traffic brought to a standstill , in 2000 the preacher tariq ramadan launched his france-activity . 
  this prayer room , which some consider to be a simple mosque , is the center of those who follow the political ideology of the muslim brotherhood . 
  i am in france , i go on a road that still daresto call itself rue du jambon , street of ham . 
  i approach a newly opened bookstore , and despair . 
  in the display are posters that teach children islamic rules , such that you can not mock others , rest on the right side and make three breaks while drinking . 
  on the book tables you see the celebrities of the political islam , hani and tariq ramadan , as well as the historical figureheads of the muslim brotherhood , sayyid qutb and hassan al-bana . 
  * music , says an imam , is for pigs * all this reminds me uncannily to the oran of the1990s , when the islamist city government as a first measure closed the conservatory , forbade music and dance and condemned art as an imported sin . 
  was not an imam filmed in the brittany town of brest a few weeks ago , when he told his small pupils , music is made for apes and pigs ? 
  when the extreme right related organization civitas organized a conference against the gender theory , the security service was not organized as conservative catholics but of the bearded men of the tawhid-center that are equally hostile towards marriage for all . 
  how many such incidents will it take to open the eyes of the leftists of saint-denis ? 
  at the institute of technology of saint-denis , a stone 's throw from the hair salon coiffure mixte away , a student organization has called for that lecture times shall not fall into the prayer times . 
  because he dared to remember the values of the republic , the institute director became the victim of a brutal campaign of intimidation , received threatening letters , his car was damaged , he was beaten . 
  what do the police do ? 
  where is the political left ? 
  in the nineties , i saw my fellow algerian citizens equally helpless in the face of enormous intellectual and logistic machinery of algerian islamists . 
  islamism came treading softly , with small , successive audacities , initially very keen not to scare anyone - to finally plunge into terror and barbarism . 
  * from fewzi benhabib ( the press ) ` this article was published on monday in the french left magazine `` marianne '' , two days before the anti-terrorism mission in saint-denis in connection with the terrorist attacks on 13 november . 
  translated and shortened has him anne-catherine simon . 
  as i said before , the islamist , sultanist foreign policy of * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * , akp and erdogan is the single most important obstacle to progress and modernisation of the societies of the middle east . 
  if you want to discuss that in context and comparison with other actors , let us not spoil this thread with whataboutism , i made a comprehensive comment with many links a while ago in the subreddit on the syrian civil war : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3kqf19/the_politicalideological_differences_between/cuzx9uu, 
  sorry if you live in a world where reading recommendations are so uncommon that they appear suspicious to you . 
  my interest is progress and modernisation of the societies of the middle east . 
  the islamist , sultanist foreign policy of * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * , akp and erdogan are the single most important obstacle to that aim . 
  i am not `` obsessed with turkey '' , i want the republic of turkey to stop sabotaging progress and modernisation of the societies of the middle east . 
  i recommend the excellent recent article `` turkey could cut off islamic state 's supply lines . 
  so why does n't it ? '', 
  in * the guardian * . 
  an outstanding piece of sincere journalism . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/turkey-cut-islamic-state-supply-lines-erdogan-isis  the exact relationship between erdo\u011fan 's government and isis may be subject to debate ; but of some things we can be relatively certain . 
  had turkey placed the same kind of absolute blockade on isis territories as they did on kurdish-held parts of syria , let alone shown the same sort of `` benign neglect '' towards the pkk and ypg that they have been offering to isis , that blood-stained `` caliphate '' would long since have collapsed -- and arguably , the paris attacks may never have happened . 
  and if turkey were to do the same today , isis would probably collapse in a matter of months . 
  yet , has a single western leader called on erdo\u011fan to do this ? 
  the islamist , sultanist , anti-modernity , anti-liberal-order agenda of the akp-erdogan-government of turkey is both a major strategic sabotage and a shame for nato . 
  here is some stuff that anybody should know about the undeniable close links between the turkish government and isis ( first three links are comprehensive september 2014 lists of links to media reports , last two links are articles from july 2015 in the wake of the abu sayyaf raid ) .

  most of the `` moderate syrian rebels '' are islamists themselves . 
  the term `` moderate islamists '' is cynical nonsense , as islamism like every totalitarian political ideology always pulls to the ultimate , never is sustainably moderate . 
  the only reliably secular , democratic , open society grouping for syria is the `` syrian democratic forces '' , centered around the progressive kurdish ypg . 
  and those are not bombed by either the usa or russia , only by turkey . 
  the usa even has all subgroups it supports vetted by the ypg .

  chomsky has a point .

  i would wish very much that turkey would rejoin the civilized world , join us in fighting islamism , be the lighthouse of enlightenment and humanism , of secularism and the open society , that atat\u00fcrk 's republic could be . 
  however , the current reality of erdogan 's turkey is a different one . 
  a recent illustration here , armed forces in an ethnic kurdish town in turkey 's southeast , shooting at people and shouting `` allahu akbar '' . 
  https://twitter.com/dijraberi/status/666575246099619840 this is the behavior of isis , not of a civilized country . 
  this is not atat\u00fcrk 's republic . 
  this is erdogan 's , akp 's and * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * ' islamist , neo-ottoman `` yeni t\u00fcrkiye '' , better called `` walayat anatolia '' . 
   you know that inside turkey kurds are the most conservative group of people right ? 
  yes , i am fully aware of that . 
  we berliners even have a powerful symbol for this mainstream kurdish islamist backwardness , the person and fate of hatun s\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc . 
  and mainstream kurdish islamist backwardness is exactly the reason why the secular progressive kurdish movement is so important , why it is so important to support it . 
  the same struggle is happening in the kurdish society of iraq , by the way . 
  there is an excellent and very readworthy * carnegie * paper `` kurdistan 's politicized society confronts a sultanistic system '' on this . 
   the moderate turks are - like the germans - not breeding well , an overview over births statistics and fertility rates in turkey demonstrates that the high birth rates are most strongly correlated with kurdish ethnicity ( to a degree that within two generations , ethnic kurds might be the majority in the country ) . 
  from this point of view , the probably most encouraging process in turkey in the long term is the increasing association of secular progressive west coast turkish citizens with the secular progressive kurdish movement . 
  there is a reason why the islamist ( be it isis or neo-ottoman ) bombings of suruc and ankara targeted exactly this milieu . 
  reminds me of similiar encouraging developments in the neighbouring arab world . 
  here is a very readworthy article `` invisible atheists . 
  the spread of disbelief in the arab world '' . 
  please notice that `` atheism '' in the arab world is less a genuinely religious concept and primarily a concept of political and social emancipation . 
  https://newrepublic.com/article/121559/rise-arab-atheists encouraging reports from egypt , too . 
  http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/18/egypts-quiet-social-revolution/ so let us hope ( and contribute ) that erdogan 's islamism will be washed down in the toilet of history sooner than later . 
  the same disgusting stuff happened some weeks ago in konya . 
  that part of turkish society ( supporters of * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * , voters of akp and erdogan ) sought to dishonor and disgrace the victims of the islamist massacre in ankara , they interrupted the minute of silence in the stadium with mocking chants of `` allahu akbar '' .

  the erosion of empathy in society goes hand in hand with the rise of bigotry and sectarianism . 
  ( ... ) it has become increasingly hard to voice different opinions . 
  journalists are being imprisoned . 
  cartoonists are being sued . 
  on television every evening critical-minded people are lambasted on state channels . 
  instead of empathy and coexistence , apathy and distrust have become the norm . 
   do n't worry , they also booed for the ankara victims . 
  soccer fans are widely known to include some of the worst people in any given society . 
  i am aware that such disgusting stuff happened some weeks ago in konya . 
  the islamofascist part of turkish society ( supporters of * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * , voters of akp and erdogan ) actually wants to dishonor and disgrace the victims of islamist massacres . 
  they did the same thing in konya after the ankara bombing ( of a secular , progressive rally ) , where they interrupted the minute of silence in the stadium with mocking chants of `` allahu akbar '' .
