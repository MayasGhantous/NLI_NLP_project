  the erosion of empathy in society goes hand in hand with the rise of bigotry and sectarianism . 
  ( ... ) it has become increasingly hard to voice different opinions . 
  journalists are being imprisoned . 
  cartoonists are being sued . 
  on television every evening critical-minded people are lambasted on state channels . 
  instead of empathy and coexistence , apathy and distrust have become the norm . 
  ( ... ) however , in other parts of europe , civilized respect and human togetherness exists : `` france and england fans sing la marseillaise at wembley stadium '' http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/france-england-fans-sing-la-marseillaise-wembley-stadium-paris-terror-attacks, 
  be careful about the cholesterol thing . 
  there are people who suggest secular kurdish ypg is ethnically cleansing arabs in syria by giving them cigarettes and food containing cholestrol & gluten . 
  video proof , taken after the recent liberation of the al-hawl area from isis : https://twitter.com/isis_med/status/666354581832663040, 
   labeled as terrorist group ypg is definitely not labeled a `` terrorist group '' by anyone else than a handful of turkish islamists , turkish fascists and in particular turkish * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * islamofascists ( among the latter , regrettably , is their president , a guy called erdogan ) . 
  even the secular kemalist turkish opposition leader kilicdaroglu calls out this nonsense labeling for what it is . 
  and the usa , europe , the whole world works perfectly with ypg , which represents the best progressive thing that happened to the middle east ever ( except only for atat\u00fcrk and israel ) . 
  and the best force against isis .

  the world can only imagine with horror what the turkish army is doing to ethnic kurdish people in the southeast , while we speak . 
  in rojava amnesty ( and any journalist ) could and can reaearch , and amnesty claimed to have found some isolated cases of displacement of non-combatant isis supporters . 
  and even that was debunked .

  the turkish-kurdish pkk is a political party under the roof of the progressive kurdish movement kck , independent of and equal to the syrian-kurdish pyd and others in iraq and iran . 
  the ypg is the armed forces of the democratic multi-party ( pyd-led ) self-government of rojava , syrian kurdistan . 
  do n't embarass yourself by writing nonsense , dude , even if you might hate secular kurdish people more than anything else on earth . 
   by turkey by the way , here is some stuff that anybody should know about the undeniable close links between the turkish government and isis ( first three lists of links from september 2014 , then two articles from july 2015 ) . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-l-phillips/research-paper-isis-turke_b_6128950.html http://www.danielpipes.org/14486/turkey-isis http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2014/06/more-on-turkish-support-for-isis http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/26/isis-syria-turkey-us http://www.businessinsider.com/links-between-turkey-and-isis-are-now-undeniable-2015-7, 
  if you want to make contact with `` syrian democratic forces '' , i would suggest to google `` lions of rojava '' ( that is foreign volunteers network , civil and fighting , there are websites and facebook pages ) or try here on reddit to ask / u/lions _ of_rojava or / u/jordan _ matsonypg which are verified to my knowledge . 
  my empathy with the unapologetic isis symathizers and supporters in your video is limited . 
  but watch this video , taken after the liberation of the al-hawl area : ypg is ethnically cleansing arabs in syria by giving them cigarettes and food containing cholestrol & gluten . 
  well , there is always a downside when you comment on videos without watching them . 
  give it a try , the video is really cool and worth the time to watch it . 
  those links are to syrian-kurdish ypg/j fighters , and no government except only the turkish slanders those as `` terrorist '' . 
  the us government works closely with them in syria . 
  by the way , the ideology that all progressive kurdish groups under the kck umbrella share is rather communal-libertarian * democratic confederalism * , not what people associate with * marxism * . 
  [ edit ] if you want to get into the theory , here are two links . 
  http://new-compass.net/articles/revolution-rojava http://roarmag.org/2014/08/pkk-kurdish-struggle-autonomy/, 
   i really wonder if your most used words on reddit is `` progressive ethnic kurdish women '' i would guess that i used `` sincerity '' and `` enlightenment and humanism versus islamism '' more often . 
  however , `` progressive ethnic kurdish women '' from today 's perspective happen to be a key to a better future for the entire middle east , so it makes sense to reference them often enough . 
  why would i delete it ? 
  there is nothing more contrary to both the security of europe and the decency of human kind than the attempt by erdogan 's * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * regime in turkey to slander emancipation and personal freedom as `` terrorism '' . 
  my guess would be that erdogan 's * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * regime in turkey also reported every ethnic kurdish woman who owns a miniskirt ( or displays other indications for secularism and love for modern life and personal freedom ) as a `` terrorist '' , so maybe the french were just overwhelmed . 
  https://www.youtube.com/v/4jrqfj67gum for further illustration , here is a picture of a woman doing the ultimate terrorist act in the eyes of the erdogan 's * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * regime in turkey , committed by a syrian-kurdish ypj fighter after the recent liberation of al-hawl from erdogan 's isis allies . 
  please klick it only if you are ready to face the worst of all the ugly atrocities many turkish flag users here are so obsessed accusing progressive ethnic kurdish people ( their code for them : `` pkk '' ) of . 
  one does not have to parachute to join the `` syrian democratic forces '' , one can simply take a scheduled flight to erbil in the autonomous kurdish region of iraq and travel west by bus . 
  actually many volunteers from all over the world do that for quite some time ( usually going for the ypg/j , the biggest group under the sdf umbrella ) , to help people in syria fight back isis and live in freedom , or help with administrative and humanitarian tasks . 
  if international volunteers can do that , it should not be too much to ask for from able-bodied syrians themselves , in my humble opinion . 
  here is a recent map of control in the region ( sdf is included in the yellow or mixed green/yellow in syria ) : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:syria_and_iraq_2014-onward_war_map.png google `` lions of rojava '' for the foreign volunteer stuff . 
  the `` syrian democratic forces '' actively fight isis and occasionally al-nusra ( another hardcore islamist faction ) . 
  they are in a kind of cold truce and cold non-cooperation with the assad regime . 
  their position for the future of syria is that there must be a negotiated political solution , a secular and sincerely democratic constitution built on liberty and minority rights , for the way forward . 
  with russia , iran and any other actors , they talk but do not associate . 
  and an important point is that they establish actually good governance in territories they conquer . 
  by the way , here is their balance sheet of the recent operation to liberate isis-occupied areas in southern hasakah governate from today : http://anfenglish.com/kurdistan/sdf-releases-balance-sheet-of-the-operation-in-south-heseke here is some video coverage after said operation ( in arabic ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erh75-lhxj0, 
  the `` syrian democratic forces '' in the northeast , secular and modernist and multi-ethnic ( built on the basis of the progressive kurdish movement in rojava region ) , are a perfect place for every syrian to contribute to a good future for syria . 
  the `` syrian democratic forces '' have the full support of the civilized world , including weapons from the usa and air support from the international coalition . 
  and they are winning every battle . 
   pkk is the reason why turkey is yet again at the mercy of erdogan and his lackeys . 
  if pkk was smart enough to not to take the akp 's bait . 
  watching atrocities like suruc and doing nothing is not a viable option for the pkk , which is built on the concept of answering violence with violence . 
  but talking about `` baits '' , it is ironic how erdogan got so many turkish nationalists vote for his policies that are destroying everything they love and value before everyone 's eyes . 
  i have no doubt that the turkish army could destroy much of what is left from syria by invading . 
  but if they do that , the standard of living in turkey ( economically , socially , politically ) would quickly head towards the african average . 
   helping to kurds i am not much interested in kurds . 
  i am interested in modernisation and secularisation of the middle east . 
   rojava 's fault was siding with pk rojava is a kck ( in your terminology : `` pkk '' ) creation . 
  rojava is part of the progressive , secular kurdish movement . 
  that 's not a bug , it 's a feature . 
   you 're being hammered by turkey i am not `` hammered by turkey '' in any sense of the term , rather the other way round . 
  i achieved fascinating results in getting political and business berlin aligned with the agenda of economically drying up turkey . 
  love to punish you for your isis and other islamist support in syria , for trying to `` hammer '' good and decent people who just want to live secular and in peace with anyone else . 
   the weaker side well , last friday was the darkest day for the military of the turkish republic ( inasfar as it can still be called a republic ) ever . 
  the turkish armed forces suffered bitter and humiliating defeats in four major battles , shingal and al-hawl , al-hadher and al-eis . 
  and they have been fleeing the battlefield all weekend , conceding hundreds of square miles of territory to secular forces ( including ypg ) . 
  for the next days , more of the same is to be expected . 
  and even on turkish territory , in silvan the turkish military for the first time was unable to take a town defended only by local youth . 
  dude , the age of turkish narcissism is over , erdogan 's islamist policies destroyed it all , face it . 
  the priority of policy towards each and every middle east country must be la\u00efcit\u00e9 , secularism . 
  this is the basis for everything else . 
  it is regrettable that there are people who needed the paris massacre to learn this lesson , but better late than never . 
  such new new policy will contribute to avoid future massacres , contribute to modernisation and progress , emancipation and human advancement in the middle east . 
  apart from one particular issue you seem to be a cool guy . 
  however , if the al saray gave me the task of torturing you , i would put you in a prison cell with three ypj girl prisoners imported for the task from `` our al-nusra allies '' who would then tell you all day how much the rojava revolution transformed their personal lives for good and free in wonderful ways . 
  terrorist , dude . 
  for the dirty man in the ak saray you are a terrorist now . 
  while the ancient history part you tell is true , more differences have developed between shia and sunni over time . 
  of particular relevance is the sunni `` closing of the gates of independent reasoning ( * ijtihad * ) '' during the 10th century . 
  since then , shia clearly placed more value on independent reasoning . 
  and while the totalitarian political ideology of islamism will for certain be washed down in the toilet of history during our lifetime , the attitude towards the issue of * ijtihad * , independent reasoning , will determine if and how islam has a future as a religion . 
   i am aware of hamas 's origins , life under them would still be better than life under isis ( well for you , i would n't be alive in either ) i have been to gaza ( before 2005 ) , and whenever i met * hamas * people , i was received like a celebrity for being german ( perfectly fitting the stereotype by a tall and blonde appearance ) . 
  they admire germany , with a view to a certain twelve years of our history . 
  yes , if i would wish to fraternize with people in cherishing adolf hitler and his agenda , * hamas * would be the place to be for me . 
  however , i do not . 
  as you run an israeli flag , are you aware that * muslim brotherhood * figure morsi in egypt has multiple times said that the most important task in education is to teach children to hate the jews ? 
  are you aware that the number of israeli citizens killed by * salafist/wahhabi * type islamists is close to nil , while the gaza affiliate of the * muslim brotherhood * called * hamas * is responsible for thousands of such deaths and is obsessed with inciting more , while we speak ? 
  it might be enlightening for you to read the charter of * hamas * . 
   am i right to suppose that muslimbrotherhood monsters are true islamofashist the sunni islamist * muslim brotherhood * organisation and ideology is the only one that deserves the label `` islamofascist '' , as it was literally created and developed in the late 1920s in egypt in collaboration with european fascists , as the project to fuse the two totalitarian ideologies of then european fascism and local islamism . 
  i made a comprehensive post with many links on the * muslim brotherhood * organisation and ideology a while ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3kqf19/the_politicalideological_differences_between/cuzx9uu personally , i would prefer the archaic retarded * salafist/wahhabi * type of islamism over the perfidous islamofascist * muslim brotherhood * type of islamism any day . 
  the huge majority of people with a muslim background that i met in europe do not identify with totalitarian sharia as a political and social concept . 
  they rather identify with the values of enlightenment and humanism , with emancipation , liberty and freedom , with the concept of the open society . 
  as to deal with the problem that nevertheless is here ( according to academic research , around a quarter of people with a muslim background in europe identify with totalitarian sharia as a political and social concept ) , i recommend the ( german language ) publications of ahmad mansour of the issue . 
  http://ahmad-mansour.com/de/veroeffentlichungen/ and in the arab world , the militant identification with totalitarian sharia as a political and social concept appears to have passed its climax . 
  here are two very readworthy articles .
