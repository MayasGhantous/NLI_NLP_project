  there is still a road ahead of us , but islamism apparently is destined to be washed down in the toilet of history . 
  https://newrepublic.com/article/121559/rise-arab-atheists http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/18/egypts-quiet-social-revolution/, 
  the ever more radical and militant totalitarian political ideology of sunni islamism now serves to create an increasingly dedicated coalition from all quarters to wash it down in the toilet of history . 
  it is encouraging with a view on the progress and future of mankind that people from most diverse backgrounds come together to meet the challenge . 
  today in syria , the usa are bombing the same * isis * targets as russia . 
  shia muslims in beirut and citioyens of laicist paris are mourning over innocent victims of the same aggressors . 
  president al-sisi in egypt and the emirs of the uae work together in imploring the world to cut funding to the islamofascist * muslim brotherhood * organisation . 
  a growing bunch of people from all backgrounds , from australian conservatives to german communists , meet in the ranks of the progressive-democratic kurdish forces of rojava to fight * isis * in syria . 
  social systems theory tells us that the strongest incentive for people and communities to come together is the confrontation with a common `` other '' . 
  so in a sense we all have to be grateful towards the totalitarian political ideology of sunni islamism , as it helps humanity to discover its common cause against an adversary , come together against it . 
   what is your problem with turkey erdogan 's islamist * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * foreign policy actively , persistently and comprehensively sabotaging modernisation and in particular secularisation of the middle east . 
  i have n't heard of anyone throwing a molotov at a school in turkey recently . 
  however , the turkish-language-only schooling system is ( understandably ) perceived as the single most important tool of oppression by kurdish citizens of turkey . 
  just imagine when , extrapolating current demographic trends , ethnic kurds will be a majority of turkey 's population within two generations : what if they would then by democratic majority decide that school instruction in all of turkey may be in kurdish language only ? 
  would n't you feel marginalized and , well , oppressed by such a policy ? 
   these fuckers ca n't win . 
  the best option left for now is an informal economic boycott of turkey by private citizens , investors , businessmen , consumers , tourists , as long as the * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * regime is in office . 
  many people i know here in germany already pretty much aligned with such boycott . 
  my condolences to turkey for the bitter , humiliating military defeats its armed forces suffered today in shingal , al-hawl , al-hadher and al-eis . 
  probably the worst day in the military history of the republic of turkey ( inasfar as it can still be considered a republic ) . 
  the * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * regime a majority of its citizens voted into office has by now obviously failed not only in upholding the rule of law and liberties , managing the economy , foreign policy , but also in military matters . 
  you must be so ashamed . 
  i feel your pain . 
   a nato ally leaving all the nonsense aside ( obviously i do not condone any kind of terror in turkey , neither the state-sponsored terror nor any other ) , i would ask you to refrain from the hypocrisy of appealing to nato solidarity . 
  nato is a community of solidarity of the civilized and free world , based on shared value and aim of a secular , liberal , open society order . 
  by voting those * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * people into public office , the citizens of turkey spoke clearly that they do not want to be part of the civilized and free world any more , and the ensuing foreign policy of those * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * people affirmed the choice . 
  erdogan 's turkey is formally still a nato member , as the remaining some degree of control over the bosporus appears worth not to formally suspend or end it . 
  erdogan 's turkey is not a `` nato ally '' in any meaningful sense of the term . 
  if i recall correctly , you once said in a coversation that you expect your conscription time in the turkish armed forces in the near future . 
  in this case , this is the fate mr. erdogan plans for you : http://www.diken.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nokta3.jpg in the towns and mountains , in the valleys and villages of kurdistan , you will encounter boys and girls your age . 
  they might be you , your friend , your girlfriend . 
  but they will not be . 
  because you will come in a uniform and with a gun to destroy their dreams , to disallow their freedom . 
  many of them will just quietly hate you for it . 
  some of them , the more courageous ones and the more desperate ones , will take up arms to defend the freedom and the dreams of their people . 
  they will , in the streets , in the night , in the fog , shoot at you in defence of the freedom and the dreams of their people . 
  maybe you will kill them for it . 
  maybe they will kill you . 
  why ? 
  why will you not let both of you live , just let them live their freedom and their dreams , their way ? 
  how does it hurt you if they live and organize their lives according to their kurdish identity and heritage ? 
  how would that hurt you so much that you come to their towns and their mountains , violently , to destroy , to destroy life and to bring death , death for them or death for you ? 
  i do not want to take the title that is yours . 
  i have never in my life met a person who was so skilled in advocating eliminatory hate against a group of people as you are in advocating eliminatory hate against humans who want nothing else but live their secular kurdish identity and heritage in peace . 
  my appreciation for your skills , in technical terms . 
  i will not write what i think of you as a person , as it might sound impolite . 
  erdogan 's turkey harasses , terrorizes , tortures and even kills its own citizens if they are secular and progressive , ethnic kurdish or worst off all secular , progressive and ethnic kurdisch at the same time . 
  for illustration , here is a live ticker from silvan : http://anfenglish.com/search?term=silvan twitter pictures from silvan : https://twitter.com/search?f=images&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=silvan  thousands of residents flee silvan ( turkey ) amid ongoing conflict : `` we know from the akp 's earlier practices where it imposed curfews that very severe human rights violations are being committed in silvan '' http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/thousands-of-residents-flee-silvan-amid-ongoing-conflict.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=91097  hdp deputies gathered at the silvan municipal office , struggling to communicate with the outside world with limited signal . 
  at the office , today 's zaman spoke with hdp deputy feleknas uca , who has been in the region for last seven days . 
  `` they are firing at the homes , and yesterday we received news that they opened fire at a market . 
  seven civilians have been murdered by the special police forces and this is the 6th curfew that has been imposed . '' an exhausted uca further recounted her attempts with her colleagues to enter the curfew zone , stating that the security forces were targeting the politicians with sniper rifles . 
  by the way , is it performing art or involuntary comedy that you display the flag of `` northern cyprus '' and at the same time agitate with slander and hate against kurds allegedly `` displacing people '' , germans `` germanizing '' and implicitly equating israelis with nazis ? 
   like protecting settled germans , who are there to germanize eastern europe historically , germanic tribes originated in middle/eastern europe and later moved , conquered and settled what is today middle/western europe . 
  from the beginning of the second millenium , there was some ( re - ) settlement of german ( ic ) s to then sparsly populated middle/eastern europe , usually with the express consent of local rulers . 
  quite some of their descendants still live there ( and those today enjoy european human rights and ethnic minority rights standards , just like any other minority ) . 
  the piece of history you appear to polemically wish to refer to is only a small part of the picture . 
   kurds ( ... ) are the good guys in this and are completely unprotected agree that the progressive , secular polities of kurds in syria and iraq are `` the good guys '' . 
  disagree with the claim of them being unable to protect themselves . 
  they do pretty well if and when weapons are made available for them and the islamist-sultanist erdogan regime of turkey is kept in check by the civilized world . 
  kurds have been the only force to beat isis on the battlefield for a long time ( only with an absurd amount of western and russian high tech armament and iranian militia support the official armies of iraq and syria achieved comparable results ) . 
   fanatical drive to create an ethnoreligious state zionism simply is about interpreting jewishness as constituting a modern nation like all other nations . 
  it is a totally secular concept , there is nothing `` religious '' or even `` fanatical religious '' about zionism . 
  please read a history book , zionism has always been dominated by socialists or even communists who were radically secular and many even atheist . 
  it is arabs , local of palestine ( since the late 1960s called `` palestinians '' ) and beyond who sought to imitate nazi germany by erasing the jews . 
  zionism , on the other hand , simply is about interpreting jewishness as constituting a modern nation like all other nations . 
  there is nothing aggressive about zionism , it is just ready and willing to defend the modern state of jewish civilisation against aggression . 
  there are many good reasons for europe to support kurdish autonomy/independence and progress . 
  the cited contribution to solve the migration crisis is one of them . 
  more important even is the fact that contemporary kurdish polities are a locomotive for secularism and modernisation in the whole region , and a lighthouse when compared to either the still deeply dark islamist arab world as well as the retarded islamist , sultanistic , neo-ottoman agenda of the akp government that is bent on taking turkey back into the mental stone age . 
  however , when supporting kurdish polities , it is important to always support the most progressive actors and forces . 
  as this article states with respect to kdp/barzani led iraqi kurdistan :  back home , the problems that drove many young kurds to leave are still there . 
  many of those who left in recent months cited widespread corruption , a culture of nepotism and internal political disputes that have exacerbated the economic crisis as reasons for leaving . 
   there is a `` failure to address the problems of corruption and lack of transparency risks undermining prosperity and political stability in iraqi kurdistan , '' warned a recent report prepared by columbia university 's peace-building and rights program titled , `` task force report : state building in iraqi kurdistan . '' the authors of the report point to a `` need to consolidate iraqi kurdistan 's democratic institutions and reduce the influence of families on political parties . '', 
  ( ... )  as the european union and the countries along the migrant route try to stem the tide , those who have returned say fundamental reforms at home would be more effective than any barrier to leaving . 
  there is a very good and readworthy * carnegie * paper `` kurdistan 's politicized society confronts a sultanistic system '' : http://carnegie-mec.org/2015/08/17/kurdistan-s-politicized-society-confronts-sultanistic-system/ieta, 
  erdogan 's turkey harasses , terrorizes , tortures and even kills its own citizens if they are secular and progressive , ethnic kurdish or worst off all secular , progressive and ethnic kurdisch at the same time . 
  for illustration , here is a live ticker from silvan : http://anfenglish.com/search?term=silvan twitter pictures from silvan : https://twitter.com/search?f=images&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=silvan  thousands of residents flee silvan ( turkey ) amid ongoing conflict : `` we know from the akp 's earlier practices where it imposed curfews that very severe human rights violations are being committed in silvan '' http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/thousands-of-residents-flee-silvan-amid-ongoing-conflict.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=91097, 
   the autocratic and cleptocratic tendencies of the erdogan days is worrying  also turkey doesnt seem to be able to shake off ethnic tensions with the kurds  and islamist sympathies have made relations with israel impossible . 
   i myself much admire ataturk but am opposed to turkish membership until you get your country back thanks . 
  perfect to the point , in my humble opinion . 
  i do not care about that guy 's personal sex life , but if it has been active and promiscuous , fine for him and in this case he has one more thing in common with the other great secular , progressive , modernising figure in that part of the world , you might have heard about him , a certain mustafa kemal pasha whom i cherish very much . 
  if you seek to shed a bad light on the pkk , you should better look for another subject . 
  emancipation of people from a tribal and sultanistic background in general and women in particular is their strongest point , and everybody knows it . 
  you look hollow and ignorant if you talk nonsense about that . 
  to help you with education , some random documentaries : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qwfpdbz6wy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bexzlhedck8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prsw5s28jxy the * vice * documentary series from 2012 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0kg8vlxke https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgvkqtmjdk8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plxnihlkmm0 [ edit ] this * mirava * documentary is my personal favorite : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jrqfj67gum, 
   because majority of the non pkk kurds are not secular i agree . 
  and this progressive character of the pkk and the kck roof of progressive kurdish organisations in general deserves sympathy from europeans . 
  more sympathy than sultanist , islamist leaning kurdish actors like mr. barzani , and more sympathy than the current akp government of turkey , which in its core and in its political agenda is anti-secular , and to every decent man 's disgust in its foreign policy obsessively seeks ( but increasingly fails ) to sabotage secularization of the middle east . 
  `` secular '' is not the opposite of `` religious '' . 
  the majority of people in europe are at the same time religious and secular . 
  the term `` secular '' has no reference to the personal religion , it only concerns the sphere of the public space , politics and the law . 
  the opposite of `` secular '' is claiming an ultimate source of legitimacy for politics and the law . 
  in the special case where you claim the quran to be such an ultimate source of legitimacy for politics and the law , you are an `` islamist '' . 
  isis are islamist syrians . 
  just like milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs , the akp , mr. erdogan and mr. davutoglu are islamist turks . 
   you 're trying to make it sound like akp bombs them because they 're secular this is a matter of fact . 
  it has been the policy of akp , mr. erdogan and mr. davutoglu all along to demand that kurds shall politically self-identify as `` sunni muslims '' not as kurds , and threaten and execute violence if they so not submit to that demand . 
  just watch videos of akp campaign rallies in kurdish regions , or read public statements on the matter , it is open for anyone to see . 
  and the whole syria policy of erdogan and davutoglu is built on the same islamist concept . 
  wan na bet that the murderous military operation against the secular people of silvan would end within minutes if they would send mr. erdogan a declaration of submission under islamofascist * milli g\u00f6r\u00fcs * ideology ?
