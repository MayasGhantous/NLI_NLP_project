  here is a nice piece on the elections in turkey today from one of the leading german newspapers and the best turkey correspondent in german media , deniz y\u00fccel . 
  `` the last chance for the turkish civil society '' elaborates the thesis that `` the sunday elections are a choice between two models : the authoritarian system erdogan , and the vision of a pluralist society , as it appeared during the gezi protests two years ago . '', 
  you are aware that a military attack , by which the attackers happen to get killed , is not necessarily a `` suicide attack '' , right ? 
  your failed attempts for islamist propaganda here do your cause no good , you would be well advised to stop it . 
  just try to be silent and hope that as few people as possible will see that your country has elected a president and a ruling party who seek to educate turkish youth to genocidal hate against all people who are not sunni islamists , and that the pkk is defending themselves and in effect all of us against this disgusting attitude .

  the pkk does not use `` suicide bombers '' , their progressive philosophy and worldview cherishes life not death , they are not islamists like isis or the ruling akp party and the president of turkey , rather the opposite . 
  they defend the values of enlightenment and humanism , our european universal values , against islamists like isis or the ruling akp party and the president of turkey . 
  mr. erdogan 's bulk bombing of pkk units in iraq who are busy fighting isis ( and by the way in effect doing damage mostly to kurdish civilians in iraq ) has nothing to do with `` turkey defending itself '' . 
  this is only about the humiliated narcissism of mr. erdogan , pathetic attempts for islamist revenge , because and after the progressive kurdish movement in turkey rejected to support his plans to turn the republic of turkey into a caliphate with erdogan as caliph . 
  is turkey setting a kurdish trap ? 
  in the lead-up to turkey 's nov. 1 parliamentary elections , skeptics of the government are wondering if ankara will resort to something `` extreme '' in syria , from * al-monitor * : http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/10/turkey-syria-isis-kurds-pyd-ankara-looking-for-border-cause.html tonight was one of these awful situations when i had to listen to one of the akp-nazis for almost a minute before i could make him to shut up and at least embarass and humiliate him in front of his wife . 
  we do not want akp-nazis in europe . 
  here are other recent reports on the state of press freedom in turkey under akp/erdogan rule : https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/turkey https://en.rsf.org/turkey-coalition-calls-on-turkey-to-21-10-2015,48470.html http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/akp-govt-encouraging-further-attacks-against-hurriyet-chp-head.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=90221&amp;newscatid=338 and another submission in this subreddit today : `` more than 50 leading international media editors have written an open letter to president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan raising profound concerns about the deteriorating conditions for press freedom in turkey in the run up to the elections this weekend '' https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qtnkq/more_than_50_leading_international_media_editors/ http://blog.wan-ifra.org/2015/10/30/international-editors-act-in-solidarity-with-turkish-colleagues, 
  the * hurriyet * , which has taken its share of akp-sponsored violence against critical media in turkey , has an article up , `` int ' l editors urge for ensuring press freedom in turkey in letter to erdo\u011fan '' http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/intl-editors-urge-for-ensuring-press-freedom-in-turkey-in-letter-to-erdogan.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=90525&amp;newscatid=339, 
   an activist group that reports on islamic state of iraq and the levant ( isil ) atrocities says two of its members have been found slain in a city in southern turkey . 
   the raqqa-based activist collective - called `` raqqa is being slaughtered silently - did not say when \u0130brahim abdul-qadir and fares hamadi were killed . 
  it blamed isil for the killings , which took place in the city of \u015eanl\u0131urfa . 
   another syrian activist group , the local coordination committees , said friday the two were known activists from raqqa . 
  since isil captured raqqa last year , raqqa is being slaughtered silently has been releasing reports and photographs from inside the extremist group 's de facto capital . 
   note that % 90 of the stuff in / r/turkeysubredditwatch are satire most definitely , just satire . 
  or the accounts were hacked , right ? 
  i met some people who would say things like this on reddit . 
  / r/turkeysubredditwatch, 
  most of the citizens of turkey that i know here in berlin identify with the decent , secular parties of civilization chp or hdp anyway , so the only challenge both in may ( for the june elections ) and now in october ( for the november elections ) was to motivate them to actually go vote . 
  however , my challenge has always been the only person i know who definitely voted akp in june , a woman from konya ( who happens to be the first woman in her family to take off the hijab , which is a big issue for her ) . 
  she works in a business owned by a family of turkish-kurdish descent , who are staunch hdp supporters . 
  the woman from konya often jokes about her `` working for terrorists '' . 
  i always tried to convince her to vote something , anything , other than akp , but i failed again in june . 
  however , after the ankara bombing , she promised me to vote mhp this time , which made me not completely happy , but better than akp anyway . 
  and today , she looked at me , sparkling , and told me that she had actually in the last minute decided to vote chp this time . 
  i am so incredibly proud of her . 
  turkey , there is light in the dark , there is hope . 
  english translation of the submission :  commenting on the enforced government supervision of critical media group koza ipek in turkey , the vice-president of the european parliament and chairman of the fdp in the european parliament , fdp presidium member alexander graf lambsdorff :  `` a free and pluralistic media landscape is a basic feature of an open and democratic society . 
  this almost no longer exists in turkey . 
  freedom of expression is so severely limited there that voters can not gain a clear picture of current states of affairs . 
  thus a fair election at the weekend is at serious risk . 
   exchanging the management personnel of media at will , as it has just happened with the koza ipek group , is a direct interference with the freedom of the press . 
  although turkey is a strategic partner for the european union , we will not be silent as free democrats to such attacks on freedom of the press . 
  the pressure on journalists and publishers has become unbearable . 
   prior to the elections at the weekend , we call on all sides to moderate themselves and to ensure that voting takes place peacefully . 
  turkey needs to find , in the broadest sense , the way back to democracy . 
  until that is the case , the opening of new negotiating chapters in the accession process , which the chancellor has proposed , is a betrayal of europe 's fundamental values . '', 
  i agree with you on the substance , i myself have been horrified by akp clepto-islamism from the moment the party was founded , and i have always considered erdogan a curse on turkey , the middle east and humanity as a whole from day one . 
  it is still incomprehensible to me how many fellow liberal-libertarian people could ever see anything good in that disgusting figure . 
  however , by now the masks have fallen and every decent person has left erdogan isolated . 
  the author of this article is a good example and sincerely tells about it . 
   just to be clear the guy above is a pkk terrorism supporter . 
  well , not really , dear . 
  i am just brave enough to think that kurdish people are human beings , too . 
  but obviously that makes me a `` terrorist '' in your world . 
  here is a recent interview with a decent liberal turkish person . 
  i would invite you to read it . 
   is the election for 1st november still happening ? 
  kerdogan and davutoglu are trying their best to provoke war and terror with anyone for a pretense to cancel the elections , but until now everyone else is just cool . 
   if so what do the polls suggest will be the result ? 
  same as in june . 
   it requires both sides to want peace for there to be a meaningfull chance of it happening this interview is very readworthy in my opinion . 
  there was a brilliant article `` erdogan 's deadly ambitions '' a month ago in * foreign policy * , with the same diagnosis and line of argument , and outstanding elaboration . 
  the real `` safe zone '' in syria is rojava , the region in northern syria where the progressive kurdish movement ( party pyd , armed forces ypg ) has a stable , democratic government . 
  which akp-turkey wants to bomb away . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/opinion/the-kurds-democratic-experiment.html http://national.bgnnews.com/academic-murat-belge-details-frustration-of-being-betrayed-by-the-akp-haberi/10574, 
   all the turks are against pkk  according to a poll done on / r/turkey to understand better , see / r/turkeysubredditwatch  we are allowed to do whatever we see helpful for our self-interest just like all the european nations do for the last 150 years well , attitudes in europe as well as the world as a whole have somewhat changed over the last 150 years , in particular over the last 70 years . 
  today , we do no longer try to genocide away the collective identity of autochthonous ethnic minorities , we give them collective national minority rights . 
  you might want to consult a history book . 
  your concept of annihilating kurdish identity in turkey is a bitter anachronism . 
   `` in the region the ones opposed to turkey will lose , the ones stand with turkey will win . '', 
  in fact , the opposite is true . 
  and concerning the pathetic islamist , neo-ottoman policies of akp and mssrs . 
  erdogan and davutoglu , that is a good thing . 
  good bye , turkey , and have fun in the stone age you choose . 
  there was an excellent article `` erdogan 's deadly ambitions '' in * foreign policy * some weeks ago http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/21/erdogans-deadly-ambitions-turkey-elections-president/, 
  today , sunday october 25th , is the last day for citizens of the republic of turkey abroad to go to their consulate and vote in the snap elections for parliament . 
  to vote for a sincere , secular , clean government they can be proud of . 
  to vote chp , hdp or mhp . 
  anything but clepto-islamist akp . 
  this caricature is simply outright wrong . 
  in all the countries significant numbers of refugees originate from , no german made weapons are exported to or used by any actor . 
  caricatures like this one only serve to avoid sincere debate about refugee and political issues . 
  pathetic . 
   what about after the area they are from is no longer an active warzone ? 
  go back home , unless you ( successfully ) apply for immigration under immigration laws . 
  i appreciate an intelligent rule-based policy for immigration , asylum , refugees from active warzones . 
  under such a rule-based policy , there must necessarily be an effective system of deportation of irregular migrants who neither qualify for immigration or asylum nor are refugees from active warzones . 
  i am glad to say that mr. erdogan can block twitter , facebook , youtube , reddit for turkish users , as he frequently does , but he can not deny people from other places to freely express their opinion about clepto-islamism , neo-ottoman chauvinism and the agenda to erase anything kurdish from the face of the earth . 
  sorry if you feel uncomfortable about that . 
  here are some links on what rotterdam mayor ahmed aboutaleb said after the charlie hebdo massacre . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/13/mayor-rotterdam-muslims_n_6462754.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/muslim-mayor-of-rotterdam-ahmed-aboutaleb-tells-extremists-who-dont-like-freedom-to-f-off-9975459.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/11342282/rotterdams-mayor-tells-muslims-to-pack-their-bags-and-go-if-they-dont-like-freedom.html the click-baiting title of this submission here is nonsense . 
   so do n't call a guy a barbarian dirty muslim beheader unless he tells you that he believes in that stuff . 
  funny thing is i would never even dare to call somebody a `` muslim '' ( or a `` christian '' ) , because these terms do not belong to the public or even political sphere . 
  even less so would i do it in combination with insults . 
  i prefer to talk about actual political acts . 
  like , say , how people in and from chechnya act in the political sphere . 
  or like , say , how people elect a clepto-islamist like mr. erdogan their president . 
  and i am always interested in people 's attitudes towards such acts . 
  the chechen guy gave some answers about his attitudes . 
  if your attitude towards neo-ottoman political chauvinism and towards the agenda of erasing everything kurdish from the face of the earth were equally clear , that would be great . 
   do you want us to call you a nazi every time we see you ? 
  please feel free to express yourself however you feel fit .
