  it is in turkey 's own interest to [ clean up the foreign policy mess ] ( https://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) which the islamist neo-ottomanism of akp/erdogan created . 
  the litmus test will be breaking ties with the flagship of transnational islamism , the * muslim brotherhood * organisation , which was founded in egypt in the late 1920s with the mission to fuse two totalitarian political ideologies , european fascism and traditional local islamism . 
  nothing in that headline is `` derogatory '' . 
  i answered [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gnt45/secularism_is_the_key_for_democracy_in_a_moslem/d2j6gbf ) why i used `` moslem '' ( common german transcription ) instead of `` muslim '' ( common english transcription ) . 
  and if you want to know how a subreddit becomes a `` shithole '' , just look at the vulgar , immature language that you employ in your comment , u/bobzer, 
  i answered that [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gnt45/secularism_is_the_key_for_democracy_in_a_moslem/d2j6gbf ) . 
  the term `` palestinian land '' in my humble opinion is a nonsense term , even nonsense on several levels , so i indeed `` deny that israelis build settlements in palestinian land '' . 
  by the way , israeli law ( and the law of the military administration of westbank area c as well ) does not allow anyone other than the legal owner to `` build '' on any property . 
  there is no israeli construction in the gaza strip , israel completely left the area in 2005 , the knesset explicitly declared the gaza strip `` alien territory '' . 
  if people in gaza would have used that opportunity to make their place an arab singapore at the mediterranean , instead of vowing eternal war of annihilation against israel with gaza as its base , as they did ( the blockade came only after that in 2007 ) , life would have taken a better course for everyone in the land , in particular for all people who self-identify as `` palestinian '' . 
  those facts are in the article . 
  my guess is that 80 percent of commenters did not read the article , just saw the headline as a convenient opportunity to express their general armchair opinion on the conflict . 
  the astonishing number of downvotes this submission receives , and the high relation of destructive when compared to constructive comments , in my humble opinion points to the one big problem in the debate we have to overcome : the lack of empathy within european discourse for the struggle of secular people in muslim societies . 
  there is one broad stream ( `` xenophobia '' ) that loves to discuss problems in muslim societies , but only with the perspective of highlighting and promoting the `` other-ness '' of muslim societies . 
  the barbaric totalitarian political ideology of islamism is actually appreciated as a feature that nicely underlines that `` other-ness '' . 
  there is another broad stream ( `` regressive left '' ) that seeks to silence any discussion about issues in muslim societies , because they want to silence the topic of identity and `` other-ness '' at all cost , even at the abhorrent cost of in effect advancing the barbaric totalitarian political ideology of islamism with their silence . 
  so we progressives with our deep commitment to enlightenment , humanism , open society of individual authorship for the own life , face a challenging task to promote our values and agenda . 
  and we are on the right side of history . 
  we will overcome the barbaric totalitarian political ideology of islamism and wash it down in the toilet of history . 
  my impression is that there appears to be a discriminatory admission policy in this subreddit towards submissions that contain certain words in the headline , inter alia `` muslim '' and `` turkey '' , so i avoid using such words in headlines . 
  however , in my opinion the topic of the submitted piece deserves much european interest and much discussion in this subreddit on substance ( rather than on spelling of words in the headline ) , that 's why i submitted it . 
  the recently accelerating attempt from a network of affiliates of the transnational islamist * muslim brotherhood * organisation , many of which hold highest office in turkey due to akp electoral victories , to denucleate and erode the secular republic and its features of liberty , democracy and rule of law . 
  that * muslim brotherhood * organisation was founded in egypt in the late 1920s with the mission to fuse two totalitarian political ideologies , european fascism and traditional local islamism . 
  earlier in his career , mr erdogan was infamous for openly quoting the * muslim brotherhood * credo , drawn from the european fascist strain in * muslim brotherhood * genesis :  democracy is the train which we ride until we have reached our destination . 
  apparently the akp core cadres these days feel that the right time to `` get off the train '' comes closer . 
  apparently the complacency towards their islamist agenda from european leaders like ms merkel is a major encouragement for them . 
  sounds like another case of r/insultingerdogan,

  electricity has become a luxury good for many less well-off citizens . 
  the unreliability of electricity generation by solar and wind is a major factor in driving costs .

   germans living in pre-war czechoslovakia those did not consider themselves `` immigrants to czechoslovakia '' . 
  my father 's family was among them , and they had lived there as long as records go back . 
  they were an autochthonous ethnicity , and historic statehood in bohemia had been rather `` german '' than `` czech '' in nature for a millenium . 
  in this discussion , we have to make a difference between people who become citizens of a state because the mood of history makes their established domicile part of that particular state , and those who make the choice to migrate . 
  fine description of the integration problem at hand in germany with respect to immigration from turkey . 
  deserving more comments , in my humble opinion . 
  my personal experience , based on multiple daily interactions with fellow citizens of turkish immigrant background , is that the issue of feeling `` persecuted by german degradation and arrogance , humiliated and betrayed '' is simply not existent with immigrants whose parents or who themselves at some point in their own hearts and minds made the step that they want to self-identify primarily as german citizens in our 21st century open society , as germans , and the issue is an extraordinary problem with those who never found the determination to make this step . 
  i disagree with the author that an alleged lack of respect in german society for turkey as a country of turks a nation would be at the root of this integration problem ; rather to the contrary , the switch in self-identification in my experience appears to become less likely when `` pride in being turkish '' is nourished by the environment . 
  the single most important reason for not making the step , in my experience , is addiction to a totalitarian form of islamic/islamist religiosity that has contempt for existentialist human freedom , self-authorship of one 's own life . 
  this also fits with my experience that staunchly secular kemalist-nationalist immigrant families do easiest switch their self-identification to german , and the erdogan crowd does worst . 
  even more interesting than the [ kurdish regional government in iraq ] ( http://carnegie-mec.org/2015/08/17/kurdistan-s-politicized-society-confronts-sultanistic-system/ieta ) with its problem of sultanistic , nepotist attitudes in the dominant kdp party , in my humble opinion , is the great contribution forward that the progressive kurdish movement kck ( which seeks not independence but modern federalism , and a better society under the concept of `` democratic confederalism '' ) offers to societies in turkey and syria , as we can witness in the rojava revolution in syria .

  if there were a nobel prize for propaganda slander , you would be a hot competitor . 
  yes , for turkish ultra-nationalists like you , speaking up for basic human rights is just `` a weird kurdish fetish '' . 
  to put that into perspective , i have no doubt that you and people sharing your mindset would consider oscar schindler a guy with `` a weird jewish fetish '' . 
  can not get more un-european in the 21st century than you . 
  the term `` anti-terror-operations '' as used by the turkish government is an euphemism for military campaign to erase an ethnicity of millions from the face of the earth . 
  i am fully aware that you support that agenda , and that you are proud of it . 
  as a european , i find that pathetic and disgusting . 
  just two links that other redditors submitted in this sub recently : [ turkish streets ` turned into battlefields ' - a photoreportage from turkey 's kurdish cities ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/17/world/cnnphotos-turkey-kurdish-conflict/index.html ) [ ciz\u00eer after months of turkish state terror . 
  heartbreaking !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=batewavji9g ) you think that these millions of people deserve all they suffer , you defame and dehumanize them with calling them `` terrorists '' and all those other names , because in your opinion who does not want to be a turkish nationalist , and renounce and bury any other social identity he/she has , does not have a right to live . 
  your attitude was widespread in europe in earlier times , but after 1945 we did with good reason overcome this attitude . 
  there is much for you to learn before you might actually call yourself a 21st century european . 
   on the other hand you openly support terrorist activities this is open slander , and you know it . 
  it is you who supports and cheers the harassment , oppression , torture , organized murder of innocent human beings in the middle east , if and when they just want to live any other ethnic identity than the one you deem supreme ( which appears to be `` turkish '' ) . 
  we do not want this attitude in europe . 
  we have overcome such attitudes after 1945 . 
  if you want to live such attitudes , europe is the wrong place for you . 
  in europe , autochthonous ethnic minorities have dignity and rights . 
  in europe , the idea of local government is not considered `` terrorism '' . 
  if you want to be a citizen of europe , you should learn to understand what that means . 
   actually i 'm already in the eu ( legally ) and will get the citizenship soon oh , really ? 
  after reading you extensively cheering ethnic/sectarian supremacism and policies of oppression/erasure of ethnic minorities in the midddle east , in another subreddit less than 24 hours ago , i hope being a citizen of europe will contribute to make you a more decent person . 
  this is absurd - why would anyone insult [ recep tayyip erdogan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nizptzq.png ) , who not only so benevolently rules his sultanate , but also has historic accomplishments on animal rights equality ? 
  the emancipation of the human individual from inherited structures and attitudes of restraint and oppression once was a core project of the left , if not the core claim of leftism as such . 
  how refreshing to see that a small but growing number of contemporary self-declared leftists have the sincerity , or at least the opportunism under public pressure , to rediscover their roots . 
  the high level of sincerity when compared to other polities . 
  thanks for the link . 
  that is a great comment , one of the most to the point assessments on what has been going on in turkey i ever read ... 
  kudos , u/adilu ... with citizens like you , there is hope for the republic of turkey for a good future in the 21st century . 
  this is all personal . 
  my experience with danish people ( from danes living in germany , people i meet when sailing up there , occasional visits to kopenhagen ) is that i really like their special kind of cool . 
  just like the thing with finnish girls is all personal . 
  i never loved europe 's ever closer union more than when spending time with a finnish girlfriend in a cottage in the finnish wilderness . 
  this productive tension between the roman concept of private property and the germanic/celtic concept of communalism has been present in almost every aspect of european societies for more than 2000 years , it shapes our public discourses until today . 
  if you want to research it , the easiest access is the history of civil law . 
  this says what `` turkey wants '' , not what was `` promised '' , and even less so what exactly . 
  one of our turkish ultra-nationalist friends gave [ a commission link ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-16-963_en.htm ) , which basically states that the eu representatives said they will see what it can do ( mind you , there are procedures ) , if and when turkey fulfills the relevant requirements ( which it has failed to fulfill for decades ) . 
  i see no european interest in giving the current akp-regime in turkey any free ride . 
  the productive tension between the roman concept of private property and the germanic/celtic concept of communalism in my humble opinion was much more relevant for the emergence of that european ( `` western '' ) civilisation and its later role as a global avantgarde than christianity was . 
  regions comparable to europe would be china , india , and the usa . 
  and europe has distinct features setting it apart from all three , not least an umbrella identity that cherishes and nurtures the very national diversity you write about . 
  actually the closest in this respect is india . 
  i do not mind christianity , however , for the europe i love , the age of renaissance , emancipation from the church , secularisation and laicism have been more remarkable features . 
  i do not consider christianity as something specifically european . 
  on a general and abstract level , being european to me means that i carry the historic european path of classical antiquity , enlightenment , humanism and modernity in my heart and mind . 
  on a political level , being european to me means to have the concept of liberty , democracy , rule of law and the open society in every cell of my body , and that i abhor the totalitarian political ideology of islamism as the ultimate alien . 
  on a practical level , being european to me means to live in a european society which is about every citizen creating and authoring his and her own life , in a society which is supportive and in solidarity with all enjoying this freedom to explore and live their human potential . 
  on a profane level , being european to me means next to stuff from my native germany enjoying ( spontanous personal preferences follow ) bulgarian cheese , danish cool , greek islands , british style , french libert\u00e9 , finnish girls , czech beer , austrian friends , dutch politicians , italian emotions , polish partying , romanian redditors . 
  and croats , i like croats .

  the point now rather is to make clear that visa-free travel for turkish citizens into the eu will not happen any day before mr erdogan leaves office . 
  the eu can live well without akp-turkey , but akp-turkey would politically and economically be relegated from the champions league of nations when breaking the relationship with the eu .
