  i do not condone or even think of `` gasing jews '' . 
  the idea of a racist arian supremacy is alien to me , even more so when violence against other people is attached . 
  thank you for asking . 
  if the chechen guy doing the ama would tell me that he finds totalitarian sharia ideology as much bullshit as i find totalitarian nazi ideology bullshit , i were all content . 
   i just find it amazing that we go ` hush hush , do n't say anything ' over such clear prejudice . 
  it amazes me . 
  it would all at the same time speed up reinvention of islam into modernity , integration of people with muslim background into society and public acceptance of immigrants from muslim countries , if we could only have a sincere debate . 
  it is a mistake and a disgrace that so many in the political class shy away from it . 
     australian solution with a big camp in libya is very possible and is what should be done . 
    libya is currently in a civil war . 
  will austria send its army to erect and protect that big camp ? 
   i 'd be all for it . 
  i support the idea . 
  even more so as i want to see the austrian bundesheer in battle . 
   does turkey do bad things in the european context ? 
  the complaint against akp-turkey is that it actively works to erode the values of enlightenment and humanism , the principles of secularism and the rule of law , the ideas of liberty and individual emancipation and freedom . 
  all for the sake of a cleptocrat , `` neo-ottoman '' totalitarian islamist model of society and the state . 
  mainly so in turkey itself and in countries of the middle east ( with devastating effects on some of the latter , e.g. 
  syria ) , but also with respect to the turkish diaspora in europe . 
  basically , akp-turkey takes the position of an ultimate antagonist of the open society and clean , responsible government idea and model . 
   i 've always seen them as a stable ally in the area here is a good article `` erdogan 's deadly ambitions '' in * foreign policy * on the matter : http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/21/erdogans-deadly-ambitions-turkey-elections-president/, 
  there have been some pretty good articles at * al-monitor * on the same issue in recent monts . 
  this one it titled `` the islamic state 's secret recruiting ground in turkey '' http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/07/turkey-adiyaman-isis-connection-suruc-bombing.html  according to writer-historian sahidin simsek , the city has been used as a laboratory . 
  he told al-monitor that the kurdish identity , manipulated by the state , plays a major part in today 's political makeup of the area . 
  he said , '' ** the state formulated a sunni kurd identity that hates kurdism and equates kurdism with alevism . 
  those people are working hard to keep themselves distant from kurds ** . 
  but , when the right wing could n't entice the masses , the state mobilized several congregations that coordinate closely with the state . 
  ** you have people who detest kurdism but adhere to islamism . 
  for them the next step is [ the islamic state ] ** . '', 
   osman suzen , chief of the adiyaman branch of turkey 's human rights association , thinks ( ... ) '' ** the state tolerates it . 
  if people know how these organizations operate , how they meet and how they recruit , does n't the state know it ? 
  families have complained that their children are joining these organizations . 
  ** some children have come back . 
  we know they are back but nobody investigated where they have been . 
  sure , the conservative makeup of the city plays a part , but i think families , because of their economic needs , keep quiet and do n't report . 
  they get money from these organizations . '', 
  ( ... )  for mehmet kurt , a bingol university academic who is studying islamist radicalization in southeast turkey for his post-doctoral studies at queen mary university of london ( ... ) `` there are deep cleavages in values , religiosity , faith , ethnicity and identity . 
  some turn to consuming more narcotics , some take refuge in organizations such as is . 
  ** in both provinces , the mainstream kurdish political movement is not strong , but it is getting there ** . 
  ( ... ) ** as the state 's red line is the pkk , anything that opposes the pkk is tolerated by the state ** . '', 
  just as readworthy is this one , `` captured fighter details islamic state 's turkey connection '' http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/06/turkey-syria-iraq-isis-new-turkish-unit-lures-kurds.html, 
  i do not find it academically convincing to plainly call all islamists by the term fascist , because these are different totalitarian ideologies with different genesis , construction and features . 
  however , as the * muslim brotherhood * has given itself the mission to fuse islamism and fascism , i find it proper to call this organisation ( and only this organisation ) `` islamofascist '' . 
  as erdogan and his context are more or less loosely affiliated with the * muslim brotherhood * , there is at least a case to call him `` islamofascist '' as well . 
  i would not do it , however , as the link is too indirect in my impression ; i would call the guiding ideology of mr. erdogan and his context just islamism , if a qualification is needed i would use `` neo-ottoman islamism '' . 
   for instance , the existence of a more `` extreme '' ( i use the term loosely here ) version of certain ideology benefits the its moderate wing , as the later is seen as a way to placate the former . 
  i would not agree with this thesis , at least not in this general form . 
  for example , in defending the open society against islamism , i find it helpful that outright barbarian groups like * isis * exist , when arguing against the real threat , the much more dangerous , perfidous enemies of the open society like the * muslim brotherhood * . 
  i do know ahmad mansour in person , i have read most of his publications , and i do not have the impression that he suggests to censor free speech or otherwise restrict our open society to accommodate people who want us to submit under the sharia . 
  if he would suggest such a thing , i would disagree with him . 
   it thus follow that the only way you can `` integrate '' islam in liberal democracies is by getting muslims to be of poor faith . 
  agree . 
   there is no obligation to respect islam agree . 
   some of us ( not necessarily all of us ) ought to start to lead an ideological offensive against islam itself . 
  not agree . 
  first , many muslims leave islam anyway every day , for exactly the point you criticise . 
  http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121559/rise-arab-atheists second , you would waste your energy with `` bigotry '' charges in the name of freedom of religion thrown at you , and that is even counterproductive . 
  third , there is a much better , more effective and efficient way : play the definition game . 
  insist on the difference between islam and islamism that islamic tradition itself rejects . 
  this is the battle that humanity will win . 
  even if your ultimate aim would be to overcome islam the religion ( which would be an aim i do not share ) , the course of action of explicitly only attacking the aspect of islamism would be more promising . 
  in this case , you would have to bet that defenders of islam the religion cling to islamist content strong enough to drown as a whole . 
  i made a comment on the * muslim brotherhood * with a couple of good links some time ago in / r/syriancivilwar ... here : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3kqf19/the_politicalideological_differences_between/cuzx9uu, 
    the term was coined by ayatollah khomeini to insult and harass secular , progressive , modern muslim people in iran who did not agree with his concept of submission of society and state under totalitarian sharia . 
   do you have source because i have never heard of that . 
  i 'm not doubting you , just genuinely curious . 
  i am old enough to have experienced it first hand when it happened , it was before the age of the internet , in the late 1980s and early 1990s . 
  all i can do now is google `` khomeini '' and `` islamophobia '' and look for traces . 
   my point that you cant vote against the current goverment without voting for extremists ? 
  of course you can `` vote against the current goverment without voting for extremists '' in germany . 
  there are six parties with major parliamentary representation in germany ( counting cdu/csu as one ) , and only two of them currently constitute the federal government . 
  in particular both liberal-libertarian fdp and conservative-populist afd are highly critical of the federal immigration/refugee policy , i.e. 
  the lack thereof . 
   even an offer of full eu membership an akp turkey has absolutely no place in europe anyway . 
  stone age narcissistic , insincere , cleptocratic , hypocritical islamists like recep tayyip `` the wannabe-caliph '' erdogan , emine `` the hijab '' erdogan and bilal `` the people 's money in my box '' erdogan have no place whatsoever in europe . 
  we are a continent of enlightenment , humanism and the open society , an avantgarde of humanity , not a lunatic asylum . 
  i give a shit on the `` cooperation '' of akp turkey . 
  end any talks for eu accession and delete the telephone numbers of these people from your phone , mrs. merkel . 
  the syrian refugee crisis is currently about to be solved , with us support , by russia and the progressive kurdish movement anyway . 
  the debating scene from * four lions * comes to my mind . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz0m3mtjpqo well , as long as an active promoter of the totalitarian political ideology of islam like * muslim brotherhood * affiliated tariq ramadan teaches `` islamic studies '' at oxford , the whole issue has something bizarre . 
  this is like alfred rosenberg had been invited to teach `` political ideas '' at oxford in the 1930s and 1940s . 
  in my opinion , one focus should be on tearing down the mask of the islamist * muslim brotherhood * organisation and ideology . 
  this spearhead of the totalitarian political ideology of islamism was founded and is committed to the mission of advancing and implementing an islamic form of classical fascism . 
  focusing on the * muslim brotherhood * organisation and ideology makes sense because the ideological and historical lines to the nazis are so clear to be drawn , and because this organisation is the most effective and most dangerous instrument in promoting the evil . 
   uk - over here , muslims who speak out against radical islam are branded ( somewhat paradoxically ) as islamophobes and get no-platformed when they attempt to speak . 
  oh , there have been many attempts to shut down critical open debate on ways and features of islam in gernamy , too . 
  however , since the turn of the century , open society in germany has been quite successful in rejecting them . 
  i agree with you that use of the term `` islamophobia '' to shut up critics of ways and features of islam is an utterly pathetic feature of the discourse . 
  the term was coined by ayatollah khomeini to insult and harass secular , progressive , modern muslim people in iran who did not agree with his concept of submission of society and state under totalitarian sharia . 
  ten points that ahmad mansour suggests in this interview : 1 . 
  the federal republic of germany sets up the office of a federal commissioner to prevent and combat ideological radicalization . 
  focus of prevention work are the educational institutions , from primary school to university and vocational training . 
  the lessons in politics , ethics and social studies involve systematic learning of debate ( according to the british model ) . 
  criticism , arguing and weighting furthers the capacity for autonomous thinking of students . 
  in training courses for future teachers , the phenomenon of ideological seduction and radicalization of children and adolescents receives a clear , compulsory , not only optional place . 
  in the preventive work , maximal use is made of the internet . 
  youth services and social workers provide effective approaches to work with parents and put them into action . 
  the existing project structure in the prevention and youth work ( fragmented , short-term financing , arbitrary content , lack of nationwide overarching concepts ) is completely reformed . 
  in the preventive work , the partners for the fight against islamism are carefully selected .
