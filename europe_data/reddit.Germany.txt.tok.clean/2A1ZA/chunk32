  there are 150,000 refugees in turkey but they wo n't come home yet . 
  the main reason is fear of mines , '' said hamo . 
   turkey maintains a general embargo on trade with rojava , the name given by kurds to kurdish majority areas of northern syria . 
  there is also a ban on humanitarian aid , such as de-mining equipment and medical supplies , despite there being manifest need . 
   if pkk somehow succeeded , kurds would go full out civil war the pkk sister party pyd factually governs rojava ( kurdish region of syria ) , and there is nothing of a `` civil war '' . 
  rather to the opposite , as the * new york times * observes in the very readworthy recent piece `` the kurds ' democratic experiment '' : http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/opinion/the-kurds-democratic-experiment.html as you mention refugees , the pkk even has a track record of managing the refugee issue very well . 
  in places where the pkk cares for refugees in iraq and syria , they are happy where they are : http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/forget-the-un-meet-the-self-determining-refugees-in-kurdistan-20151005-0021.html  your 10 most used word the only reason why i created a reddit account is to add another forum where to make a humble contribution pro modernisation contra islamism in the middle east . 
  i am grateful for the confirmation you provide that i am on target . 
    `` lynching culture '' ( * al-monitor * )  al-monitor huh ? 
  yes , their recent article `` the revival of turkey 's ` lynching ' culture '' is so well written to the point that i find it fair to reference them when quoting the term . 
  http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-revival-of-lynching-culture-against-kurds.html  in / r/turkey you mean this ? 
  / r/turkeysubredditwatch, 
   not all of them islamist , but majority kurdish cities are more islamist than turkish cities you are all correct in describing islamist-tribalistic backwardness in kurdish society . 
  actually you only have to write the name `` hatun s\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc '' to convince any berliner like me . 
  however , now comes the point : kurdish society has embarked on a radical modernisation project , without precedent in the middle east except for the successful project of mr. mustafa kemal . 
  and the pkk ( which most turkish redditors hate and demonize with so much passion ) is the modernist , secular avantgarde of kurdish societies . 
  there is an excellent * carnegie * paper , `` kurdistan 's politicized society confronts a sultanistic system '' , about kurdish society in iraq ( least pkk influence of all four kurdish societies , and probably not only by coincidence the most islamist-tribalistic of the four ) : http://carnegie-mec.org/2015/08/17/kurdistan-s-politicized-society-confronts-sultanistic-system/ieta, 
   we are fighting pkk not the kurds !, 
  why can ethnic kurds , 20 percent of the population of the republic of turkey , not choose mother tongue primary schooling for their children in kurdish ? 
  how exactly does `` fighting pkk '' necessitate this horrendous denial of basic human rights of kurdish citizens of turkey ? 
  why can provinces and towns in general , and in regions of overwhelming ethic kurdish majority in particular , not have some degree of autonomy to organize the public space according to the wishes of the local population ? 
  how exactly does `` fighting pkk '' necessitate this denial of real life democracy ? 
  why must the most important piece of kurdish cultural history be submerged in a reservoir ? 
  how exactly does `` fighting pkk '' necessitate this horrendous crime against cultural heritage of kurdish citizens of turkey ? 
  why does the republic of turkey abuse religion through its state monopoly of sunni islamic teaching for propaganda that the idea of ethnic kurdish national identity would be against islam , while at the same time ethnic turkish national identity is celebrated and any criticism against it even prosecuted by means of criminal law ? 
  how exactly does `` fighting pkk '' necessitate this pathetic treason against the basic values of enlightenment , decency and fairness ? 
  why do the turkish government factually encourage a `` lynching culture '' ( * al-monitor * ) of ethnic turkish citizens against ethnic kurdish citizens ? 
  how exactly does `` fighting pkk '' necessitate this retarded return into a pre-civilization mentality ? 
   if we had wanted to erase the kurdish face there wouldnt be any left . 
  oh , you did try , and you went and came pretty far . 
  by threat of violence the republic of turkey came close to erasing the kurdish language . 
  it is one of the few bright spots in the legacy of mr. erdogan that he at least abolished the prosecution and persecution of people for simply speaking a word in kurdish in public . 
   oh and them being civilised ? 
  my interest in tribalistic , pre-civilization kurdishness is zero . 
  if the kurds were the people as which you depict them , i would still find your genocidal policies against them to be wrong , but i would look into another direction . 
  however , the kurds are not the people as which you depict them any more . 
  the kurdish societies have , by the initiative of the pkk and mr. abdullah \u00d6calan , experienced a modernisation project that finds an equal or superior in only one other such project in the whole history of the whole of the middle east , you may have heard of it , some guy mustafa kemal was in charge . 
  just to make my point clear : my interest is neither turkey nor kurdistan , neither turkish nor kurdish ethnicity . 
  my interest is the emergence and spread of the values of enlightenment and humanism and of the open society concept in the middle east . 
  i cherish and have cherished all of my life the modern republic of turkey . 
  but you can not be true to your own modern identity by enjoying the light and incarcerating other in chains in the darkness . 
  the pkk are your brothers and sisters on humanity 's path into the light . 
  accept it , or get washed down in the toilet of history in denial . 
  i strongly recommend the excellent publications by mr. ahmad mansour on the issue of mainstream muslims and mainstream islam creating , enabling and nurturing islamism . 
  his articles in general have the welcome feature of not only describing the problem and challenge accurately , but also suggesting paths and instruments of solutions . 
  http://ahmad-mansour.com/veroeffentlichungen/ ( english ) http://ahmad-mansour.com/de/veroeffentlichungen/ ( german ) a very good read is for example his most recent article : http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/islamismus-salafisten-machen-die-bessere-sozialarbeit-13826637.html?printpagedarticle=true#pageindex_2 this is an excerpt from his upcoming book `` generation allah '' , available from october 8th . 
  the person who `` learns nothing '' obviously is paul krugman himself , who still seeks to push to sell his heroin of deficit spending to europeans . 
  sorry , sir , europe is abstinent and clean now . 
  we want a sincere life , and no eternal hell of debt and debt crises . 
  you have to look elsewhere for customers of your heroin . 
  turkey warns of a refugee crisis . 
  the erdogan government of turkey has created , incited and nurtured the syrian civil war with its islamist neo-ottoman agenda , and it is now increasing the crisis with its genocidal policies against anything kurdish . 
  to end the refugee crisis , one must categorically end both the islamist neo-ottoman and the anti-kurdish policies of turkey . 
  turkey must choose to become a pro-modern civilized country . 
  turkey must give up its violent paranoia against kurdish identity . 
  to shed some more light on the issue , this article is a nice read on how the refugee problem is being solved locally : http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/forget-the-un-meet-the-self-determining-refugees-in-kurdistan-20151005-0021.html  meet the self-determining refugees in kurdistan : rejecting the victim narrative , pkk-supported refugee camps in iraq and syria have taken control of their fates by creating their own autonomous system . 
  i very much regret that the republic of turkey appears to choose an agenda of totalitarian islamism as well as an agenda of violently erasing anything kurdish from the face of the earth over being part of the civilized world . 
  this brilliant piece `` erdogan 's deadly ambitions '' is a great read on the situation in turkey in 2015 : http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/21/erdogans-deadly-ambitions-turkey-elections-president/, 
  deficit spending can `` cause growth '' in the same manner as taking heroin can cause a bright mood . 
  i assume you know that there are good reasons against taking heroin , and the same reasons apply against deficit spending . 
  mr. krugman is absolutely right that we would have short term more growth with deficit spending , just as we would have short term a brighter mood with taking heroin . 
  honorable mr. krugman , the heroin of deficit spending is the curse on the economies and societies of europe . 
  the european union is abstinent now , and trespassing by heroin pushers is not warranted . 
  good day , sir .

   israel ... annexation of parts of the wb ... 
  apartheid ... may i make one correction ? 
  annexing parts or all of judea and samaria ( `` westbank '' ) and offering all people who actually live in the respective annexed territory israeli citizenship would be the exact opposite of `` apartheid '' ( a term that does not suit israel anyway ) . 
   islamic front has been supported by nato since to beginning of the civil war definitely not . 
  your claim is an utterly frivolous lie , islamist . 
   also some people seems to confuse islamic front with isis distinct groups , both are disgusting islamist evil . 
  the latter also operates in iraq , has a better pr department and more prominence , that 's all . 
  i am confident that mr. fabius does consider the civilized world persepective on `` terrorism '' , not the one held by islamists like king salman of saudi-arabia or mr. erdogan of turkey . 
  otherwise france would have to bomb all the places that `` terrorize '' poor islamists by not submitting under the sharia , like tel aviv and tokyo , san francisco and london , cape town and berlin , jakarta and tunis , sao paulo and mumbai , or paris itself . 
   turkey supports sultan murad brigade which are said to be moderate islamists . 
  this `` sultan murad brigade '' is an islamist terrorist group in syria that is totally sponsored and controlled by turkey , as part of the neo-ottoman agenda of mr. erdogan . 
  the name of that group is no coincidence . 
  and please do not use the cynical nonsense term `` moderate islamist '' . 
  * islamism * is defined as the totalitarian political ideology that aims to submit society and state under totalitarian sharia rule , that considers not the will of the people , reason and discourse as the source of legitimacy for political power and the law , but only the quran . 
  * islamism * is a totalitarian political ideology no less despisable than its dark sisters , * fascism * and * leninism * . 
  all totalitarian ideologies by their very nature always pull to the ultimate , they are never sustainably moderate . 
   ahrar ash-sham is the american-led intervention in syria . 
  not at all . 
  this islamist terror group ahrar al-sham receives no support at all from the usa , rather the usa bombs them whenever need arises . 
  ahrar al-sham gets support from qatar and from turkey . 
   but , there is n't or ever was a thing that suggests turkey supports isis . 
  oh yes , there is .

  not generally . 
  but your comment definitely is ill informed . 
  well , i assume it is rather trying to be apologetic for the anti-enlightenment , anti-humanism , anti-secularism , anti-open-society , anti-modernity , islamist agenda of mr. erdogan . 
  but i try to be polite and consider it ill-informed . 
   for added fun , check out r/turkey and see how absolutely no one there sees anything wrong with it . 
  check / r/turkeysubredditwatch for some light on / r/turkey, 
  there was a brilliant recent article `` erdogan 's deadly ambitions '' on * foreign policy * , which paints a very accurate picture of the state of affairs in turkey . 
   we need a muslim country to be a guiding light in reformation of islam . 
  like egyptian president abdel-fattah al-sissi in his new year 's day speech at al-azhar ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dehnarfrlec  instead we have saudi arabia funding the worst of the extremisms .
