  in my humble opinion the most important issue to be solved . 
  i know that ahmad mansour ( who currently serves as chairman of the muslim forum germany ) has frequently touched the issue of homosexuality in his publications . 
  always in the sense of presenting homophobia among muslims as a problem that must be overcome . 
  i do not know of an elaboration other than the claim that rejection of homosexual people must end . 
   so a total heresy in the first two points and it all goes from there the first three points were presented by the guy who chairs the university institute where most future teachers of islam in germany study . 
  my understanding is that this is the islam which is taught in germany ( university of m\u00fcnster ) . 
  first time i heard taha 's name was at an university lecture in political science , when the lecturer covered sayyid qutb he briefly mentioned taha as kind of opposite . 
  as sayyid qutb is the only human being that ever lived which i actually hate ( i do not like the emotion of hate and seek to stay clean of it ) , i got curious about that `` opposite '' . 
  relax , take a snickers . 
  here is all you need to know about [ practicing islam in short shorts ] ( http://truestories.gawker.com/practicing-islam-in-short-shorts-1683991294 ) . 
  by the way , this chairman of the `` muslim forum germany '' , ahmad mansour , is a psychologist and leading expert in anti-radicalization . 
  on that press conference , he also warned that the incoming muslim refugees must be cared for by liberal german muslims , not mainstream imams from arab countries . 
  here are some publications from the guy : http://ahmad-mansour.com/veroeffentlichungen/, 
  i am no muslim , but my favorite scholar of islam was beheaded in sudan . 
  his name was mahmoud mohammed taha . 
  he taught a smart , enlightened islam that suited well for today and could shine into the future . 
  his basic point is that only the verses from mecca should be considered timeless . 
  you do not have to convince me of the distance to cdu thing , i hold office in another political party ... the fact that konrad-adenauer-stiftung felt the need to trumpet its contribution to getting the thing founded is that kind of arrogance many people dislike about the cdu ... 
  i am aware of all this . 
  however , the people in this `` muslim forum germany '' are the brightest heads that muslims in germany have to offer , like ahmad mansour , lamya kaddor , the head of center for islamic theology at the university of munster mouhanad khorchide and the director of the center for islamic theology at the university of tubingen , erdal toprakyaran . 
  and there are no other real muslim associations in germany . 
  by far the biggest is turkey 's ditib , which just automatically registers all turkish or ex-turkish citizens in germany . 
  besides of that , there is only fringe , the most visible of which is the self-proclaimed `` council of muslims in germany '' , whose narcissistic boss ayman mazyek is pretty present in tv but considered rather a mixture of fundraiser , salesman and clown by muslims and the general population alike . 
  i use the video from the press conference - read quran in historic context - consider islam not as finished but as an open process - islam is not the only path to paradise - unrestricted self-determination of women - reject hijab for children - all education must be for a life in self-determination - reject patriarchal structures - inclusion of muslim girls in all educational activities at school - separation of religion and state/politics - no tolerance for intolerance or violence - islam is diverse - encourage critical thinking all the remaining points appear to be about how to teach islam to the youth and in doing so encourage critical thinking and a culture of open discussion about islamic issues, 
  i frequently argue for enlightenment , humanism and the open society . 
  in my profession , in politics , in private , on the internet . 
  i reject totalitarian ideologies , e.g. 
  i reject the quran ( like any ther allegedly * ultimate * source ) as a source for any kind of legitimacy for power over other people ( be it political rule , the laws or just spontanous violence ) . 
  islamists , i.e. 
  people who seek submission of the society and the state under totalitarian sharia rule , hate me for it . 
  the question if there is a `` jihadi veto '' against free speech in my humble opinion is the one question for the destiny of europe . 
  my petition is to reject such a veto . 
  i have personally received around one islamist death threat per month over the past 15 years . 
  i am proud for every one of them . 
   relations between arabs and kurds in syria here is a good recent article `` the kurds ' democratic experiment '' about rojava ( syrian kurdistan ) from the * new york times * . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/opinion/the-kurds-democratic-experiment.html in iraqi kurdistan ( krg ) , things are more complicated . 
  i recommend the excellent * carnegie * paper `` kurdistan 's politicized society confronts a sultanistic system '' . 
  there has a notewothy claim been made by russia :  we attack isis whatever they call themselves . 
  the problem here is that the `` us-led coalition '' has allowed the border between secular opposition against assad and islamists to become blurred . 
  this is the right moment to give up the cynical nonsense concept of `` moderate islamists '' , as islamism like any totalitarian political ideology always pulls to the ultimate , never is moderate . 
  * [ edit : typo ] * what must be done is to draw a clear and coherent line between the secular opposition ( notably progressive kurdish ypg/j and anyone who partners with them ) on the one hand and islamists in every form and shape ( notably isis , jabhat al-nusra , ahrar al-sham and anyone who partners with them ) on the other hand . 
  i never tried taybeh beer . 
  but i had at various points some anecdotal contact with the multi-facetted world of a christian arab starting and running a micro-brewery in `` west bank '' samaria . 
   jesus said to them , ` render to caesar the things that are caesar 's , and to god the things that are god 's . ', 
  ( mark 12:17 ) this claim of seperation of the spheres of the political and the religious is a necessary condition for the compatibility of christianity and open society . 
  in fact the qu ` ran is two books in one . 
  one half of the qu ` ran is mohammed quotes from mecca , where he delivered spiritually enriching messages . 
  the other half of the qu ` ran is mohammed quotes from medina , where he set pedantic rules as an autocratic warlord . 
  the mecca part of the qu ` ran , and only this part , actually is a worthy religious book , but until now every enlightened islamic scholar who suggested to simply drop the medina part ( like mahmoud mohammed taha ) has been beheaded . 
  as you obviously speak german , here is an article ( from 2013 ) where ahmad mansour describes at length how he is `` talking to the people it 's talking about '' : http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/familie/2013-02/muslime-familie-ehre/komplettansicht, 
   i just hope that most of the europeans will wake up and take action fast enough before things turn from ugly to bloody . 
  i happen to know ahmad mansour in person , and i am , from my place , politically working on this same message that he so brilliantly elaborates in this article . 
  by the way , ahmad mansour was cured from islamism at tel aviv university . 
  we will seek to be as effective in open society education as you obviously are . 
   when they 're born and bred in the middle east i recommend the great piece `` invisible atheists '' by ahmed benchemsi for a reading . 
  http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121559/rise-arab-atheists the author of our article , ahmad mansour , was `` born and bred in the middle east '' , too . 
  and so was hamed abdel-samad ( an interview with whom is linked in the comments ) , or raif badawi . 
  islamism is the totalitarian political ideology of submitting society and state under the sharia . 
  like every totalitarian political ideology , it is fundamentally antagonistic towards the open society . 
  it is by its very nature ultimate and never moderate . 
  the sources of this `` political islam '' must be drained before it comes out as openly radical and violent , this is the point of the article . 
  all publications of ahmad mansour can be recommended for reading . 
  http://ahmad-mansour.com/veroeffentlichungen/ [ english ] http://ahmad-mansour.com/de/veroeffentlichungen/ [ german ]  ahmad mansour is a psychologist . 
  for the past ten years , he has lived in germany where he works to promote democracy , equality and freedom of speech . 
   ahmad was born in 1976 close to kfar-saba in israel . 
  when he was a young palestinian , ahmad mansour almost became a radical islamist . 
  today he is one of germany 's leading experts on islamism and radicalisation . 
  support for the progressive rojava project is `` pushing for pkk news '' in your eyes ? 
  well , i definitely am a dedicated supporter of what is happening in rojava , it is a historic leap forward for the entire middle east . 
  however , you might wish to reality-check your definition of `` pkk '' . 
  so you are an `` atheist , kurdish , childfree '' guy on the internet who loves to call a radical secular german guy on the internet `` pkk '' because he hates erdogan 's support for islamists in arab countries ? 
  funny , indeed . 
  why do n't you just learn from your hero tayyip and get a bit more creative in your attampts to stigmatize the critics ? 
  you might mix that `` pkk '' stuff bit more with calling me `` zionist '' , `` g\u00fclenist '' , `` armenian '' , `` zoroastrian '' , and some other more creative things . 
  i know that hardcore islamists like u/casburism love to distort facts . 
  the discussion you might refer to was that nowruz is a holiday closer to the ancient religion ( s ) / tradition ( s ) of europe than any abrahamitic religion/tradition . 
  and this is pretty obviously true . 
  just as true as the fact that our 21st century enlightened , humanist open society is better mirrored by what you supremacists call `` terrorist kurds '' in rojava than with either islamist akp voters or ultra-nationalists in turkey . 
  just some days ago , erdogan gave a speech calling for the blood of `` atheists '' ( and of `` zoroastrians '' ) . 
  people of whatever ethnicity working in turkey 's tourism industry should not worry about their jobs , but rather worry to be seen publicly praying five times every day , not to become a target of the islamist mercenaries which these days count as `` turkish security forces '' . 
  why is the republic of turkey going down the drain ? 
  well , most people know all these issues with the narcissistic-megalomanic erdogan autocracy . 
  but the main point is very concrete . 
  it is about foreign policy towards syria , it is mr. erdogans obsessive nurturing and support of adherents of the barbarian , totalitarian political ideology of islamism in syria against the secular , polyethnic , progressive lighthouse polity of rojava there . 
  [ us , kurds to clear path toward raqqa , with or without turkey ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/turkey-syria-raqqa-isis-kurds-menbij.html ), 
  peace definitely is not a sufficient condition for education . 
  and not even a necessary one : look at [ rojava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rojava ) , where a historic education effort takes place in the middle of the syrian civil war . 
  the most important point simply is to value enlightenment and humanism over petty socio-political identities ( ethnic , religious , racial , whatever ) . 
  son , the law is politics . 
  the law is my profession . 
  and exactly because this is so , i tell you that your kind of considerations are the worldview of an undergraduate student , but not for a person concerned with reality . 
  your innocent theoretical ideas about proceedings and social impacts of sharia courts are laughable at best . 
  you are aware that from a reality point of view , `` court proceedings '' are a matter of social authority , and 16 year old girls do not frequently challenge `` court rulings '' they are exposed to ( without counsel ) in courts of appeals or in the european court of human rights , right ? 
  i am all fine with arbitration in general . 
  the crucial point is family law . 
  i had numerous discussions with islamists in germany , and i always said i am ready to discuss sharia courts if they have no jurisdiction in family law . 
  no way , family law is the one thing they are interested in . 
  gaining as total as possible control over the sexuality of females ( and in particular underage girls ) is the one thing they are interested in . 
  this is a fundamental culture war on the question if a woman is a self-determining person or the property of the male members of her clan . 
  `` voluntary '' sharia courts are nothing but an instrument for those who claim the latter .
