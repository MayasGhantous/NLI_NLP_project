  the idea to own an ultimate set of all-encompassing rules that are legally binding for other people is the very definition of a totalitarian ideology . 
  if you are unfamiliar with the terminology , you might want not to embarrass yourself with bold nonsense . 
  sharia law is a textbook example for a totalitarian socio-political ideology . 
  it is an all-encompassing set of allegedly ultimate rules that claims to regulate every aspect of the personal life ( up to details like how to clean one 's ass on the toilet ) as well as every aspect of social and political life . 
  denying that is just ignorant . 
  your username is relevant here , in my humble opinion . 
  if someone lives islam as his/her personal religion , and just follows rules for himself/herself without claiming authority of rules over any other person , that has nothing to do with sharia ** law ** and islamism . 
  a totalitarian socio-political ideology like sharia , disguised as `` religion '' , has `` religion '' involved in all personal matters . 
  and in my humble opinion , everyone in europe , including underage daughters of islamist parents , should be free from having their personal matters forced upon them by any totalitarian socio-political ideology . 
  fully aware of the problem , i live and do politics in berlin . 
  and i am fully aware that while we speak , right here in my city , tens of thousands of people ( mainly , but not only young girls ) desperately hope for finding a path to personal freedom , out of the brute islamist parallel society that is their prison . 
  and we should do everything to help them find such path , not hand additional torture instruments to their tormentors . 
  good video ( in german ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykwhjzzovli, 
  i really wonder how reality-detached many people in this thread argue . 
  technically everything you write is correct . 
  however , if a 16 year old girl has been `` married '' ( not valid under british law ) by an imam , and the sharia court her parents drag her to , and her whole community watches her before , tells her with all the social authority of `` court proceedings '' that she is supposed to consummate that marriage , it will profoundly change the world of that girl forever . 
  she will have lost what many generations of our ancestors in europe have fought for every man and every woman in europe to have . 
  the problem is ( a ) most brute social pressure in most intimate personal affairs that can not in any way be compared to commercial arbitration , and ( b ) the particular issue of parents declaring such submission for their underage daughters . 
   all of that could happen with or without sharia courts . 
  sure . 
  but `` voluntary sharia courts '' are one instrument to make it more likely to happen . 
  and this is the one dominant motivation why islamists seek `` voluntary sharia courts '' . 
   multiculturalism it that term has any meaning , it is an extreme form of relativism that surrenders the basic values of enlightenment and humanism and the individual authorship of the own life in the open society to `` other values '' . 
  well , under sharia courts , a girl might celebrate her 18th birthday married to a man she never wanted to marry , pregnant with a child she never wanted to have , traumatized and scarred by years of submission under the stone age totalitarian social rules of a `` religion '' she never believed in and never wanted to submit herself under . 
  parents ' authority over their underage children is not absolute under german law and under english law . 
  in particular not with respect to religion , sexuality and marriage , the most relevant points in the `` voluntary sharia court '' topic . 
  no , parents can not force their underage daughter to do whatever they want under german law or under english law . 
  imagine a 16 year old girl who is against her will told to wear a hijab , marry her cousin , as examples . 
  sure they are only a symptom . 
  but it is not as simple as you portray it . 
  for example , if parents make the legally binding choice for their underage daughter to accept sharia law and rulings of the `` voluntary '' sharia courts , the girl loses the opportunity to seek legal recourse against many forms of abuse . 
  islamists tried this shit in germany as well , in 2012 the spd justice minister of the state of rhineland-palatinate suggested allowing for `` voluntary sharia courts '' . 
  i am very pleased that an outcry from all quarters of our open society prevented the totalitarian socio-political ideology of islamism from gaining this foothold in the legal system . 
  sharia is a totalitarian socio-political ideology . 
  it is perfectly wise and smart for everyone who cherishes enlightenment , humanism and the open society to reject anything that references sharia , including `` voluntary '' sharia courts . 
  the main problem with those `` sharia courts '' is that parents choose for their underage children , namely girls . 
  and even for adults , the choice for people who live in the islamist parallel society is not voluntary by any meaningful sense of the term . 
   voluntary the main point of these `` voluntary '' sharia courts is to subjugate underage girls to brute islamist rules . 
  the `` voluntary '' choice is made by their parents for them . 
  possibly a surge in death metal since the true state of public finances was revealed after 2008 ? 
  yeah , and the residents of the devastated or about-to-be-devastated towns in turkey 's southeast , like cizre , are citizens of the republic of turkey with passports of the republic of turkey . 
  once again my respect for the dedicated anti-corruption drive in romania . 
  is there any good recent overview article folks from romania would recommend to the audience ? 
  [ turkey approaches the vision of sultan erdogan ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4zndepimrx8/uohgkyarkyi/aaaaaaaaeig/ti9diiit0hc/s1600/!cid_ii_1337f684b7cab1f3.png ) do n't worry , folks , this one woman is a temporary necessity , under the soon to be established ~ ~ caliphate ~ ~ presidential system , such kuffar/atheist dead roads like women in public life will finally be completely gone . 
  sorry , hijab is the ultimate turn-off for me , politically as well as erotically . 
  i could ( and did ) have nice chat with a most extreme bozkurt woman calling for genocide against kurds , and i could ( never did ) flirt with a tak suicide bomber on her way to her mission . 
  but whenever a woman/girl wears a hijab , i would just run away . 
  if you ask me why i would vote chp and not hdp if i were a citizen of turkey , i could give you a thoughtful , elaborate political reasoning . 
  however , the simple answer would be that there are less hijabs on display at chp rallies . 
  i will have to contact her again later this week for a professional reason anyway . 
  however , * this * name will have me somewhat investigate the context in depth before i 'd go for the call of nature . 
  if she is in any way personally involved in the `` family business '' ( which i am not sure about yet ) , her life and communication will not go unobserved . 
  can someone tell me why i always meet the `` pkk girls '' ? 
  only some couple of weeks ago , a flirt turned out to be a dedicated activist . 
  oh , you never heard about the `` unarmed terrorism '' concept that erdogan introduced , for turkey as the only place in the world ? 
  read here : http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/turkey-erdogan-introduces-new-thought-crimes.html http://tark.org.tr/abuse-of-anti-terror-law-is-destroying-turkeys-democracy-1547/ and your idea of just mentioning `` pkk '' without elaborating about the individual to call him/her a `` terrorist '' is another case in point . 
  for example , i remember well how the turkish ultra-nationalist brigade in this subreddit just some days ago sought to label someone a `` terrorist '' for attending the funeral of some pkk-related person . 
  while one might always discuss the taste and wisdom to attend a particular funeral , turkey definitely is the only country in the world where ultra-nationalists zealots will seek to persecute you as an alleged `` terrorist '' for the act . 
  currently , the visa process is a big hurdle for legal travel to europe . 
  most of the refugees from places like cizre would probably have visa applications denied , for technical and economic reasons . 
  and applications for political asylum must be made on eu territory . 
  today , they would have to risk their lives crossing the sea with smugglers and have to apply in greece . 
  with a visa waiver , they could simply get into a bus to munich . 
  the citizens of towns like cizre might have other things than tourism in mind once we offer them to flee turkey for europe . 
  i would find it hard to imagine how we would deny requests for political asylum by tens of millions of people who are persecuted for `` unarmed terrorism '' ( a crime that exists only in erdogan 's turkey ) because of their ethnicity and/or their political opinions . 
   your daily copy pasta how progressive the kurds are i still find that traditional kurdish society is appallingly regressive ( greetings to the s\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc family , if you meet them ) , and the more valuable i find it that there is a movement for radical progress . 
  wo n't you cheer with us the progressive social and political transformations against all odds as we can watch them in rojava ? 
   giving up the fight against pkk on an event this evening here in berlin , i met a person who obviously was a female citizen or former citizen of turkey in her mid-20s . 
  extremely attractive , maybe what one would call `` 9 + '' . 
  when occasion arose , i touched the `` southeast '' issue , and as her first reply was cautious , she obviously was kurd ( kemalist girls immediately start to rant against the `` terrorists '' ) . 
  i introduced myself with my credentials , and when i asked for her name , i recognized her last name , which was the same as a very well-known pkk personality . 
  yes , her uncle . 
  she even had pictures with her . 
  she estimated that a third of her family is in turkish prison , and another third in the qandil mountains . 
  we had a really nice chat , and we did not fail to meet the point how regrettable it is that the pkk needs to have such a prohibitive attitude towards sex in order to reach the traditional kurdish society for its gender progress program . 
  she did not hesitate to give me her mobile number . 
  what do you suggest i should do with my direct line to qandil now ? 
  the one and only `` victory against the rising far-right tide '' will be when the establishment political class gets to forcefully agree that immigration to europe must be on the existing citizens ' terms only , and transparently so . 
  without such a consensus , the `` rising far-right tide '' might lose battles , but it will win the war . 
   the reasonable parties across europe need to take note and build an effective mechanism for controlling migration and regulating it on our terms . 
  if our political class fails to meet this challenge , most countries of europe will within a decade be governed by parties which are today labelled `` populist far right '' , and they will dominate the discourse and the path our societies take . 
  mark my words . 
  these measures are not `` effective '' in any sense that would benefit the republic of turkey and its citizens . 
  turkey since erdogan has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the world ( not even north korea does that ) which recognizes a crime called `` unarmed terrorism '' , where there is no connection with political violence , however remote , needed in order to be jailed as an alleged `` terrorist '' . 
  http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/turkey-erdogan-introduces-new-thought-crimes.html http://tark.org.tr/abuse-of-anti-terror-law-is-destroying-turkeys-democracy-1547/ and now , turkey moves to prosecute most pro-kurdish party members of its parliament . 
  kati piri , turkey rapporteur for the european parliament , called friday 's amendment an `` historic mistake . '', 
  the large and powerful neighbour , upon whom one projects all one 's self-esteem issues , from whom one obsessively tries to distinguish oneself by means of pathologic fixation on the own `` islamic identity '' ( thus blockading one 's own development and growth as an open society , and creating and nurturing all these deep societal and political problems haunting oneself ) ? 
  for erdogan 's turkey , this antagonist is the european union . 
  germany recognized pretty much all about it , actually the guy who later assassinated the main perpetrator was cleared in a german court in the 1920s already . 
  it is only about the term `` genocide '' , which president gauck used for the first time in 2015 , and which the bundestag will now use on june 2nd 2016 . 
  indeed germany was allied with the ottoman empire , and there are plenty of reports from german officers on what happened . 
  from those it is most obviously evident that the top of the ottoman empire had given the order that the land shall be cleared of armenians , and lower administration executed that order . 
  in the us , influential `` anti-defamation-league '' demanded that the usa recognize the armenian genocide as such . 
  http://www.jpost.com/diaspora/adl-to-recognize-ottoman-empires-massacre-of-armenians-as-genocide-454110 and on june 2nd , the german bundestag will find clear words on the issue . 
  come on , guys and gals in sweden , your european friends will happily welcome you in the nato security family . 
  can tell you from experience that it works well . 
  liberal republics with their citizenship concept are the modus operandi by which mankind is progressing . 
  misguided juvenile attempts to blur the distinction between citizen and non-citizen are the reason behind the rise in nationalism . 
  neo-nazis should award medals to everyone who wears a `` nobody is illegal '' sticker . 
  are you offering what in politics is called `` plausible deniability '' ?
