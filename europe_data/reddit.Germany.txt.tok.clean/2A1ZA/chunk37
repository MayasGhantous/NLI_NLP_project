  for muslim extremists , we 're never muslim enough . 
  luckily for london 's `` first muslim mayor , '' god invented secularism . 
  expats and immigrants are not the same thing . 
  there are very few true american immigrants in germany , i know some of them , and all of them are exemplary in learning german language , socialising with native germans , doing community services and that kind of stuff , zero self-segregation . 
  actually american immigrants ( not expats ! ), 
  are probably the most perfect non-european immigrant group i ever met , only the even fewer canadians come close . 
  sure it is much paperwork . 
  but it is the only way to `` statistically leave islam '' become counted as `` without confession '' in germany , if you want that . 
  anyway , the reason why i write all this is that i am complaining about the fact that the german federal statistics bureau gives the number of `` muslims '' in germany much higher , more than double as high , as it actually is , if a `` muslim '' is considered a person who self-identifies as `` muslim '' . 
  you can formally join and leave an officially recognized religious community in germany . 
  however , the german federal statistics bureau does not handle the term `` muslim '' that way . 
  that is my point . 
  if you ask the german federal statistics bureau for the number of `` christians '' in germany , they will tell you the number of ( at that point of time ) registered members of christian religious communities . 
  if you ask the german federal statistics bureau for the number of `` muslims '' in germany , they will give you the number of ( at that point of time ) registered members of islamic religious communities plus the number of all other people where an ancestor has immigrated from a muslim majority country . 
  is bill clinton a slovak ? 
  * disclaimer : i hoped for a sane person ( rubio , kasich , sanders ) , disillusioned now . 
  only those states of syria , iran and sudan ( and indirectly iraq ) have a government-sponsored aggressive policy directed `` against the west '' . 
  you may wish to google the term `` axis of resistance '' . 
  agree . 
  bio-passport ( the eu demands that as well from others ) and prudence with respect to people who hold additional citizenship of middle east states with violently islamist societies does make some sense , in my humble opinion . 
  however , as the us discriminates between diverse eu member states in visa waiver affairs , maybe the eu should retaliate against that by every december making a lottery that chooses five us states the residents of which must apply for visa if they want to travel to europe the following year . 
  the us do not check ancestry , they check additional citizenship of these states . 
  and i find that not unreasonable . 
  while i am opposed to multiple citizenships anyway , it is a reasonable point in these cases of countries with violently islamist societies to ask what is behind the people in question so strongly identifying with them that they do not want to give up that citizenship after migrating to europe . 
   is muslim now an ethnicity like jew is ? 
  the german federal statistics bureau effectively uses a definition for `` muslim '' that almost reminds to the nazi definition for `` jew '' . 
  it uses the definition of hardcore islamists : everyone with ancestors from a majority muslim country is counted as `` muslim '' , and there is no way to escape , apostasy from islam is even less possible before the german federal statistics bureau than in saudi arabia or in the `` islamic state '' . 
  actually if you are counted as `` muslim '' in germany , the only possibility to become free for the statistics is to formally join one of the official christian churches and then formally leave it . 
  only that way you can manage to be counted as `` without confession '' . 
  it is thus no surprise that german statistics vastly overestimate the number of people who self-identify as `` muslim '' in germany . 
  the german federal statistics bureau uses the same definition for `` muslim '' as hardcore islamists do : everyone with ancestors from a majority muslim country is counted as `` muslim '' , and there is no way to escape , apostasy from islam is even less possible before the german federal statistics bureau than in saudi arabia or in the `` islamic state '' . 
  actually if you are counted as `` muslim '' in germany , the only possibility to become free for the statistics is to formally join one of the official christian churches and then formally leave it . 
  only that way you can manage to be counted as `` without confession '' . 
  it is thus no surprise that german statistics vastly overestimate the number of people who self-identify as `` muslim '' in germany . 
  in germany , there is no self-segregation known from any immigrant group other than from the middle east . 
  well , all of my grandfathers and great-grandfathers served in the wehrmacht during world war ii , and none of them survived the war . 
  but why exactly should that bar me from criticising you today for promoting violent oppression against people whose only `` crime '' is that they want to ethnically self-identify and live being `` a kurd '' , under reasonable local government , in places where their ancestors did so since time immemorial ? 
  his way probably takes him [ to the countryside ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/domestic_goat_kid_in_capeweed.jpg ) . 
  i was talking about this one journalist . 
  by the way , will you answer my question on mr stephenson ? 
  do you think he should be jailed for `` terrorism '' ? 
  i trust you that they diligently arranged the rifle next to the dead body , it is not necessary to send me a picture of it , but thanks for the offer . 
  i am confident that you guys are not even aware of the irony of your trying to talk down the excessive abuse of the term/concept `` terrorist '' in turkey and at the same time you being obsessed here with trying to paint everyone who disagrees with you as `` terrorist '' . 
  i can tell you that for those who are aware of it , it is hilarious . 
  are n't you a bit ashamed of that absurd reality-detached propaganda in your comment ? 
  turkish `` security forces '' shoot dead a journalist whose reporting they did not like , and you praise that act as a good thing that may not be outlawed ? 
  to consider reality , just look , for further illustration , at the case of alleged `` terrorist '' chris stephenson . 
  do you think people who have an invitation for a hdp newruz party in their pocket should be sent to jail as alleged `` terrorists '' ? 
  it will be six factions . 
  ( 1 ) if spd/greens/linke have a majority , they will do it . 
  ( 2 ) if not then both spd and fdp will flatly reject a coalition with merkel as chancelor , and either the cdu then plays it very smart including dropping merkel or it gets really revolutionary . 
  merkel will probably run for the cdu/csu , they will win less than 30 percent of the vote and merkel will be unable to form a coalition with her as chancelor . 
  only question is if the spd manages to do it , or if the cdu kicks merkel out for somebody else to get the job done . 
  ms piri suggests that visa-free travel from turkey will not happen soon . 
  it will not happen before all objective criteria will be fulfilled , and she does not expect turkey to achieve that anytime soon . 
  http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/visa-free-travel-for-turkish-citizens-not-possible-in-short-term-says-eps-piri.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=98786&amp;newscatid=351 i have appreciated ms piri 's sincere work on akp-turkey for a long time , she actually speaks up for europe where the commission and the council do shy away and betray our polity of europe and the values and the citizens whom they are supposed to serve . 
  i do not know who will be chancelor in germany after 2017 , i would not even make a public guess from which party he/she will be . 
  but i know that it will not be ms merkel . 
  and i will enjoy every minute of watching her being thrown under the bus by her own party . 
  the utterly misguided policy of submitting to the regressive autocrat [ erdogan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2e2yhjc_mc ) narrative will cost merkel the chancelorship in germany by 2017 . 
  buy your popcorn and watch . 
  great piece , thanks for submitting . 
  which will however not be read , and if read not understood , by those elements of dumb downvote brigading on everything that does not parrot the ultra-nationalist narrative on turkey , who fear , avoid and seek to silence anything that looks like an intellectual challenge . 
  the potential result of another early election is not clear , and the [ nosediving economy ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/bad-loans-bankruptcies-sound-the-alarm-for-turkeys-economy.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=98714&amp;newscatid=344 ) is another factor that might bring an unwelcome surprise for akp ( much of the akp reputation is about allegedly being economic growth wizards ) . 
  i do not think erdogan will take that risk , he can have the same result much cheaper and without risk by liquidating hdp deputies . 
   i still wonder how will they change the constitution they will try to do it via outlawing hdp and/or imprisoning their deputies . 
  and trust me , my friend , you and the other turkish ultra-nationalists on reddit will blindly cheer them for `` fighting pkk terrorist kurds '' , you will cheer the erection of the gallows from which your freedom and you will hang . 
  there is a famous [ quote from martin niem\u00f6ller ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/grwkehf1kdw/maxresdefault.jpg ) which i aready recommended people in turkey like you to look at while followers of g\u00fclen were persecuted . 
  most did not care , because it was only the g\u00fclenists . 
  next it will only be the `` pkk terrorist kurds '' . 
  then the leftists and liberals . 
  then the `` western capitalists '' . 
  and when they knock on your door , there will be nobody left to defend you . 
  yes . 
  however i would add that this downvote brigade which harasses this subreddit for around half a year is all dedicated to supremacist turkish nationalism . 
  there are also a lot of turkish redditors , including among those who use a turkey flair , who do not subscribe to that brand of supremacist turkish nationalism , who do not deserve a bad name , who deserve our solidarity and support .

  any federalists here ? 
  there is a question that i and many others struggle to find and answer to . 
  we all know that the main stumbling block of further integration and closer union is the lack of a distinct european identity in societies ' discourse . 
  we all know that social identities are constructed by defining itself in opposition to an * other * . 
  now history has presented a perfectly suited * other * in the form of anti-enlightenment , anti-individual-emancipation sharia society . 
  but many federalists appear to hesitate , after the charlie hebdo bombings i did get the impression that a historic window of opportunity for europe had opened , but now it appears to be rather fading out . 
  dear federalists , what exactly makes you miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ? 
  ** newroz piroz be , nowruz mobarak to all iranian people , to all kurds and persians , in europe !, 
  ** a good new year is about to start . 
  does anyone have pictures from today 's celebrations to link ? 
  * [ edit ] as apparently many readers here are unfamiliar with newroz/nowruz , which hundreds of thousands berliners with an ethnic iranian background , and many millions all over europe , celebrate today , and their friends with them , here is a guide [ persian new year , or nowruz , explained for non-persians ] ( http://www.vox.com/2016/3/20/11265872/persian-new-year-nowruz ) . 
  * * [ edit ] to the great amount of questions on my person in the comments : no , i have no iranian ( persian , afghan , kurdish , whatever ) background myself , i am all ethnic german , i just live in the cosmopolitan city of berlin and enjoy it , just like millions of other berliners and people all over europe do . 
  * * [ edit ] found this news article [ refugees celebrate persian new year in berlin church ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2016/03/refugees-celebrate-persian-year-berlin-church-160319130350158.html ) on al jazeera . 
  that church is here in berlin mitte where i live . 
  quelle : internet . 
  prominent local politician katarina blume in hamburg is leaving the cdu for the fdp , taking her mandate with her . 
  she does not do so for local politics reasons at all , she says , cherishing her local cdu as much as ever . 
  it is all about federal politics , she says . 
  the would not want to identify with restrictions on and erosion of personality rights , erosion in the freedom of press and the arts any more , under the cloak of `` fight against terror '' and the like . 
  http://m.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article207544267/cdu-abgeordnete-wechselt-zur-fdp-in-altona.html i wrote it here more than once : what is eroding is not only freedom , but also support for the affiliation and policies of angela `` emine '' merkel . 
  this is latest indication that the erdogan accommodation spells doom for merkel and her party . 
  you think that mr boehmermann deserved to be thrown under the bus by making him the target of hundreds of death threats against his family , by accusing him with all the authority of your office of being `` intentionally hurtful '' ? 
  we the german people do not want such erdogan attitudes , ms merkel .
