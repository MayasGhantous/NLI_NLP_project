  ms merkel and others should finally grow the courage and wisdom to call [ erdogan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/btm5t7j.jpg ) 's bluff . 
  for the sake of civilization . 
  for the sake of of europe . 
  and for the sake of all decent citizens of turkey , so that the country can finally transform from akp-turkey to the 21st century republic of turkey . 
  [ not least in foreign policies ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) . 
  if parents decide their children `` should n't be in school '' because the environment there is too open minded and not islamic enough , the state will take away the custody and the children from them . 
  i say : rightly so . 
  society has a humanist resonsibility towards these children . 
  homeschooling is not legal in germany . 
  and the topic of this discussion is exactly the reason why i support upholding that ban on homeschooling . 
  by the way , in other european countries parents who want to homeschool their children usually have at least to prove qualifications . 
  question to everybody : do you think juncher has really understood the wrong and considers it a wrong now , or is he still a megalomanic who thinks he knows better how we should live our lives than we ourselves do ? 
  you guys even have a gay turtle as your president . 
  ca n't be more progressive . 
  turkey should simply stop supporting jihadi islamists in syria , then there will be no more refugees and existing refugees will soon be able to return . 
  as you cite the secular opposition in turkey , this is another good idea they have been talking about for years . 
  let 's hope turkey can overcome its [ foreign policy mess ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) soon . 
  and probably not only in syria . 
  there has been growing evidence for a long time that erdogan is even recruiting foreign jihadi islamists to fight and kill secular ethnic kurdish citizens of the republic of turkey in the civil war within turkey . 
  [ this recent article ] ( http://kurdishquestion.com/article.php?aid=3116 ) is just one more . 
  ( 1 ) the first point is that `` after erdogan '' , there is much reason for confidence that whatever comes will not be a one-man-autocracy again , and that liberty , democracy and rule of law will have a field day . 
  the republic of turkey has a long tradition of republican government . 
  this episode of one-man-autocracy is alien to the history of the republic of turkey . 
  ( 2 ) the second point is that erdogan is associated with the * muslim brotherhood * organisation , which was founded in the late 1920s in egypt with the express purpose of fusing the two totalitarian political ideologies of classical european fascism , then on the rise towards its heyday , and local islamism . 
  i recommend the links in [ this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3kqf19/the_politicalideological_differences_between/cuzx9uu ) that i made some months ago . 
  it is a most important , urgent and noble task for civilized humanity in the beginning of the 21st century to wash down in the toilet of history the * muslim brotherhood * organisation and all its affiliates ( like * hamas * in gaza , or * akp * and erdogan in turkey ) . 
  [ picture of erdogan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/btm5t7j.jpg ) delivering the warning to the eu in a speech . 
  the citizens of the republic of turkey should choose more clean and dignified , more sincere political personnel at the top . 
  personally , i would support visa-free travel , from the day erdogan is forced to leave office . 
  kurds are an ethnic group autochthonous to the area , not immigrants to the land like modern americans , so that the claim `` as immigrants they must agree to give up their ancestral socio-political identity '' , to join the melting pot , does not apply . 
  in this respect you might rather compare them to american natives . 
  apparently you do not even challenge my point , namely that kurds are an ethnic group autochthonous to the area , not immigrants to the land like modern amerikans , so that the claim `` as immigrants they must agree to give up their ancestral socio-political identity '' does not apply . 
  so with respect to your `` answer '' that is unrelated to my point , what you write i agree with . 
  and in particular i do generally not believe in the concept of `` land belonging to an ethnicity '' , and neither do i in this case , with respect to all claims from any side . 
  by the way , the progressive kurdish movement kck ( which includes the pkk ) does not `` claim land '' , they do not want to build a kurdish nation state out of territory of the republic of turkey , what they claim is social and political justice . 
  it is not helpful for a solution of the conflict to distort this by defaming them as `` claiming land '' . 
   erdogan has backed the same parties in syria since the very beginning erdogan has backed the same jihadi islamist groups in syria from the beginning , that is true . 
  salafi jihadi islamists ( including * isis * and * al-qaeda * 's * jabhat al-nusra * ) or islamofascist jihadis with * muslim brotherhood * affiliation , [ erdogan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/btm5t7j.jpg ) did not make a difference , and he even invented a new strain of jihadi islamism , neo-ottoman jihadi islamism , and created himself in person the armed jihadi groups for it like the * sultan murad division * . 
  erdogan 's policies towards syria are the most utter shame that was ever done by a nato member country . 
  and the republic of turkey could do so much better by being true to itself . 
  this is for example well elaborated in [ this excellent analysis and blueprint ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) with the title `` how can turkey overcome its foreign policy mess ? '', 
  by graham e. fuller . 
  the issue with comparing those narratives is that today 's americans somewhen in the past centuries chose to immigrate into the melting pot where their socio-political identity would become `` american '' . 
  the autochthonous kurds living on what today is the southeast of the territory of the republic of turkey never made a comparable choice . 
  if anything , you could compare them to american natives . 
   erdogan ... enjoys copulating with cloven-hooved herbivores chances that the term `` herbivores '' will soon be [ censored ] ( http://tagespresse.dietagespresse.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/erdogan_ziege-700x350.jpg ) for people trying to access the internet from turkey ? 
  does it come with a provision that for every [ erdogan meme ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/operationstreisand/ ) on the internet the ep translation service must produce a turkish translated version or at least make turkish subtitles ? 
  [ hans teeuwen on erdogan ( english subtitles ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw2l_9zyta8 ) erdogan 's autocrat political power comes from people pumping up a pathetic lack of personal life and personal self-esteem by obsessively identifying with the autocrat . 
  destroying his usefulness as a self-esteem-steroid for his non-life fanboys and fangirls is destroying his autocrat political power .

  trust me , i know what i am talking about , it happens right here in berlin , germany , too . 
  let us hope that all people who commit atrocities in turkey will be brought to justice . 
  and let us hope even more that the sources of bitterness and aggression will be dried out .

   i doubt he would get away with calling anyone `` goat fucker '' in germany . 
  depends on context . 
  he will get away with what he did because of context ( political comedy show , satirical poem , high public interest politician as a target ) . 
  nice to hear that we share the same profession . 
  so i appeal to you among colleagues not to try to confuse the audience any longer for the purpose of trying to cover up ms merkel 's wrong and ill-fated political decision . 
   merkel has no legal obligation to make a decision exactly . 
  but she chose to make the decision to authorise prosecution of b\u00f6hmermann under \u00a7 103 stgb , thus sending a signal of encouragement to autocrats all over the world ( and to their supporters , like akp folk , here in germany ) . 
  even more unnecessary as she at the same time gave in to public pressure to abolish the antiquated \u00a7 103 stgb altogether . 
  the prosecutors ( i doubt that courts will ever see the case , what b\u00f6hmermann did is permitted under the law , and prosecutors will not indict ) would have decided anyway under [ \u00a7 \u00a7 185 to 200 stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1693 ) . 
  these are criminal laws in germany to equally protect the honor of every person . 
  some of these need the alleged victim to request prosecution , in this case mr erdogan made such request . 
  merkel made the political decision according to [ \u00a7 104a stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1041 ) to allow additional prosecution under [ \u00a7 103 stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1035 ) , the antiquated rule to protect exclusively the honor of foreign heads of state . 
  i am confident that ( although i appreciate her giving in to public pressure to announce that \u00a7 103 stgb will for the future be abolished ) this wrong signal to all autocrats of the world is the mistake that will cost her the political future . 
  by the way , good satire that an account called `` marktplatz '' tries to defend merkel . 
  good news is that ms merkel agreed \u00a7 103 stgb shall be abolished . 
  spd , fdp , greens have vigorously demanded that on a wave of public opinion . 
  but on that authorisation of prosecution of b\u00f6hmermann under \u00a7 103 stgb , she sent a wrong signal and in doing so will suffer the consequences . 
  the shitstorm in german language social media is on . 
  as a german , i am delighted that the german public is very much behind b\u00f6hmermann and annoyed by the erdoganist reaction . 
  german language social media are outstandingly excited on the issue , ridicule the autocratic megalomaniac in turkey like never before and demand a clear stand for free speech by the german government . 
  much of the anachronism in the affair actually stems from an overwhelmed by the times ms merkel . 
  let 's see if she will manage to still catch the waves of clearly rejecting erdoganist autocratic audacity and the growing campaign to abolish \u00a7 103 stgb altogether . 
  merkel promised a decision with respect to [ \u00a7 104a stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1041 ) for today . 
  however , she did not have the courage and wisdom to make her stand for the open society and liberal democracy , against narcissist autocracy . 
  [ merkel says germany still considering turkish request to prosecute comedian ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/merkel-says-germany-still-considering-turkish-request-to-prosecute-comedian.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=97838&amp;newscatid=351 ) i have all those years had a rather mixed opinion of ms merkel . 
  it has deteriorated much during her dilettant mishandling of the refugee issue , and it has now reached the point where i conclude that i am governed by a chancellor who is unfit for the office . 
  germany needs a better suited person , in 2017 at the latest . 
  with her unwarranted servility towards the erdogan autocracy , merkel obviously invited such erdoganist behavior . 
  she now has to come clear and stand firm for open society and liberal democracy . 
  or else . 
  there are criminal laws in germany to equally protect the honor of every person , [ \u00a7 \u00a7 185 to 200 stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1693 ) . 
  some of these need the alleged victim to request prosecution , in this case mr erdogan made such request , and we will see the result , as with any other person ( i can tell you for sure that there will be no concivtion in the end , because such satire of a politician is allowed by free speech ) . 
  then there is another criminal law , [ \u00a7 103 stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1035 ) , which is an antiquated rule to protect exclusively the honor of foreign heads of state . 
  antiquated because in an open society and liberal democracy , there is no reason to protect the personal honor of a head of whatever foreign state more than the personal honor of any other person . 
  anyway , prosecution under this law needs express authorisation by the federal government according to [ \u00a7 104a stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1041 ) . 
  if ms merkel will give such authorisation in this case , which is a purely political decision , is the issue of the current debate . 
  if you want to watch the b\u00f6hmermann poem once again , [ here ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x41ccav ) . 
  [ \u00a7 103 stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1035 ) should not be `` changed '' , it should be abolished . 
  in an open society and liberal democracy , there is no reason to protect the personal honor of a head of whatever foreign state more than the personal honor of any other person . 
  here is the sentence in legalese : merkel said she will announce her decision today . 
  if she decides to authorise , according to [ \u00a7 104a stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1041 ) , the prosecution of b\u00f6hmermann under \u00a7 103 stgb , she will not be chancellor any more by fall this year , take my word for it . 
  merkel said she will announce her decision today . 
  if she decides to prosecute b\u00f6hmermann under \u00a7 103 stgb , she will not be chancellor any more by fall this year , take my word for it . 
  by the way , there is an increasing campaign in germany to abolish \u00a7 103 stgb altogether .
