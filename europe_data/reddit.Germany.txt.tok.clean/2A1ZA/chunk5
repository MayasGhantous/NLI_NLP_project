  if she decides to authorise , according to [ \u00a7 104a stgb ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1041 ) , the prosecution of b\u00f6hmermann under \u00a7 103 stgb , she will not be chancellor any more by fall this year , take my word for it . 
  meanwhile , news agencies report ... [ five jailed in turkey for ` insulting ' erdogan on social media ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20160414-five-jailed-turkey-insulting-erdogan-report ), 
  i recommend [ this great analysis ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) of the pro-jihadi-islamist foreign policy of mr erdogan and [ this great piece ] ( https://twitter.com/foreignpyd/status/719480097670045696 ) from the good guys in syria that appeared yesterday in the new york times . 
  [ in his own words , mr erdogan rather considers hitler a role model for himself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=covbzhux3aq ), 
  maybe there was more truth in that poem than we think ? 
  real life satire [ in turkey 's parliament today ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-lawmaker-says-animal-abusers-should-get-another-chance.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=97614&amp;newscatid=338 ) with a member of mr erdogan 's akp party :  during a parliamentary discussion on a new draft item seeking to forbid people convicted of sexual abuse of animals from owning animals , a deputy from the ruling justice and development party ( akp ) has said animal abusers should be given `` another chance . '', 
  i did not mention the term `` fsa '' , i would never use that term , as it is a nonsense marketing label without any political or organisational substance . 
  point ( a ) fears for personal safety became only relevant recently because erdogan last summer ended the ceasefire with the pkk and last fall narcisstically made some of his former jihadi islamist proxies in syria his enemies , point ( b ) consumer boycott became only relevant recently because of much more brutal images/videos from inside turkey and more media coverage , point ( c ) russia implemented sanctions only after last fall shooting down a russian jet and brutally violating international law by murdering the parachuting pilot . 
  anyway , let 's watch if the turkish ultra-nationalist downvote brigade is still in full force . 
  i expect at least thirty net downvotes for every comment in this thread which does not sound like an [ erdogan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2e2yhjc_mc ) press release . 
  makes sense : we all know , if you downvote uncomfortable reality hard enough , it will go away . 
  [ turkey tourism bookings for this summer are down 40 % ] ( http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/03/21/turkey-tourism-bookings-down-40/ ) from last year . 
  the reasons are ( a ) fears for personal safety and ( b ) european and american consumer boycott to protest erdogan policies like frivolous civil liberties violations , support for jihadi islamists in syria , victimizing kurds in turkey and ( c ) sanctions from russia . 
  yesterday , [ israel tells its nationals in turkey : get out now ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-tells-its-nationals-in-turkey-get-out-now/ ) . 
  i would really wish other countries would prioritize the safety of their citizens over the profit interest of the turkey tourism industry as well . 
  mr erdogan created this mess by nurturing all shades of islamists for more than a decade , the problem is his responsibility . 
  in all such personal coversations i ever had in the middle east , people explicitly cherished hitler for exterminating six million jews . 
  anyway , if it were a `` disconnect '' issue , we could expect the hitler-admiration to disappear among immigrants to europe , right ? 
  but regrettably this is not yet the case . 
  it was most visible in germany in the summer of 2014 , when islamist mobs roamed the streets calling for genocide against the jews . 
  do not underestimate how much hitler is considered a legitimate object of admiration among islamists . 
  the most important islamist organisation and network , the * muslim brotherhood * , was founded in the late 1920s in egypt under the express idea of fusing local traditions of political islam with the rising ideology of european fascism . 
  what i do like about your comments in particular is that distinguished , classy language you employ . 
  actually if you care about `` the image of the arab world '' , you might ask yourself if your language really is the right way to promote it as a moderator of / r/saudiarabia posting in / r/europe . 
  and once again , you know as well as me that there is no other english subtitled version of this video available , so if you censor this video because of who subtitled it , you censor debate as such . 
  you are aware that almost all sources subtitled by memri , including this video , are not available with any other english translation , so that your attitude of censoring memri translations in fact is censoring debate as such , right ? 
  this might not be an issue for people like you who do not like the bright light of debate anyway , but for those who value debate it is very much an issue . 
   bad extremist views of the arab world are you seriously trying to tell me that this video of nadina al-buhair would be a `` bad extremist view of the arab world '' ? 
  actually memri does pretty much cover translations of the ( rare ) flowers of enlightenment in the arab world like this . 
  just try , for another example , this [ excellent interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvvvomanbro ) with saudi shura council member ibrahim al-buleihi , subtitled by memri as well . 
   enjoy your ban . 
  i enjoy your mindset naked on display for the world to see . 
  you are aware that memri only does subtitle translations , while this video itself is from [ rotana tv ] ( http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1929235,00.html ) , right ? 
  so once again my question , do you have an issue with the accuracy of the english subtitles in this video ? 
  if so , which one do you think to be inaccurate ? 
  as far as i can see , [ nadina al-budair ] ( https://glitternight.com/2016/03/01/another-heroic-muslim-woman-nadine-al-budair/ ) is outside of saudi arabia and probably safe . 
  the only retribution i know of until now was / u/tg _ wl symbolically beheading her by removing the submission of this video from / r/saudiarabia, 
  for european and american polities , the solution of the issue gets rolling if and when we start to give our respect to such enlightened people , rather than islamists . 
  [ regrettably , we still court the islamists ] ( http://nervana1.org/2016/03/31/the-plight-of-non-islamist-muslims/ ) . 
  let us overcome that . 
  as long as `` muslim majority countries '' do not vote for a clepto-islamist , narcissistic lunatic like [ recep tayyip erdogan ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dogan/ ) , both their future in a modern world and their image in the world will be fine . 
  seeing your flag , the [ czech made a pretty cool anti-isis-video ] ( https://twitter.com/ypgeurope/status/718129726422982656 ) , too, 
  the ( totalitarian ) political elements make up quite exactly half of the quran . 
  the second , later , medina half . 
  we agree that the non-political , purely religious elements of the quran ( the mecca part ) are not supposed to be `` criticised '' by the government , so angel merkel shall not lecture me about the existence or non-existence of god and my afterlife or non-afterlife and that kind of stuff , right ? 
  then fine , now you understand why the term `` islamism '' makes sense . 
  that is the political elements ( the medina part ) that should invite criticism in political discourse of a secular open society . 
  and once again , it makes much sense and is instrumental for our open society concept and agenda to separate these . 
  ok , let us start with the basics . 
  does nervana mahmoud in your opinion have the right to personally believe that this guy mohammed was a messenger of god , and the religious stuff that is recorded from him in mecca ( making up half of the quran ) ? 
  or do you think that our society/state should take measures with the aim that she will not personally believe that any more ? 
  if so , which measures would you suggest ? 
  please to not speak bullshit . 
  the enemies of our open society are people who promote the totaliarian political ideology of islamism , not `` muslims '' . 
  may i once again endorse and recommend the excellent piece [ the plight of non-islamist muslims ] ( http://nervana1.org/2016/03/31/the-plight-of-non-islamist-muslims/ ) by nervana mahmoud ? 
  [ 2013 global pew poll of muslims ( pdf file ) ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf ), 
  islamism is a ( totalitarian ) political ideology , it is the claim for a concrete form of ( totalitarian ) government , it is in the realm of the political . 
  that 's why it can and must be a topic of political discourse . 
  historically , half of the quran , the medina part , is not about religion but about politics , is islamism , quite obviously . 
  but it is the enemy 's agenda to mix religion and politics , it is our agenda to seperate it . 
  a secular open society society is not in the job to judge/dictate what `` true islam '' would be ( whatever that term is to mean anyway , historic , philosophical , theological , sociological , political ) . 
  i strongly disagree with your idea . 
  anyway , in any meaningful sense `` true islam '' is what the people who identify with it think it is . 
  i am all for media transporting the words and deeds of islamists . 
  i am for tearing them apart , exposing them , ridiculing them , i endorse `` persecuting '' them ( in the more civil meaning of the term ) . 
  i am however absolutely against presenting islamists as `` representatives and suggested role models for anyone who considers himself/herself muslim '' in government channels and media . 
  and this obviously is the position of the author of this piece as well . 
  while i broadly agree with the policy suggestions in the end of your comment , you still are insincere and dishonest in your polem\u00edc against the author of this piece , and against what i wrote . 
  neither she nor me did claim one should `` ignore '' any problem . 
  what i wrote is that perfidious islamists should not get positions of government power and public reputation in germany as alleged `` representatives of muslims '' ( and remind you , in germany only 20 percent of muslims in the statistic are islamists ) . 
  you apparently tried to misrepresent this argument , for whatever motivation . 
  well , i agree with the author that the most important step we in europe can make towards ending the horrible , barbarian , anachronistic totalitarian political ideology of islamism is not to give respect and reputation , not to give podium or media time as alleged `` representatives of muslims '' to perfidious islamists like tariq ramadan or aiman mazyek , or to the folk the article in this submission is about . 
  it appears that you disagree , but i do not see anything constructive you suggest . 
  so my impression is that it is rather you who is insincere about his agenda . 
  the author considers herself a muslim but not an islamist . 
  she does not make any claim concerning majority or minority with this position . 
  i agree with you that in the islamic world as a whole , that is a minority position ( the 2013 pew poll suggests that of statistically 1.6 billion muslims worldwide , 1.1 billion are islamists ; in germany it is the other way round , only around 20 percent of muslims in the population statistic are islamists , according to many polls ) . 
  i do not understand why you are so enraged that the author appeals for support for her enlightened position in its struggle against the other position , the islamist position . 
  do you consider yourself an islamist ? 
  my impression is that you misunderstand this piece , you appear to read it as `` defending islam '' , while in fact the piece is an appeal to european and american policymakers and media , no longer to nurture islamists . 
  the author does n't claim anyone would `` misinterpret '' a historic text . 
  she argues on the basis of the enlightened premise that muslim-ness is whatever the contemporary self-description of people concerned makes it to be . 
  i recommend this excellent recent piece [ the plight of non-islamist muslims ] ( http://nervana1.org/2016/03/31/the-plight-of-non-islamist-muslims/ ) by nervana mahmoud for a read . 
   islamists , who are a subsection of muslims , have a religiously-based political agenda . 
  they believe islam is not just a religion , but also a system of governance dictated by islamic laws . 
  ( ... ) while non-islamists are treated with indifference ; even hostility , islamism , ironically , is handled with much more empathy in some corners of the western world . 
  ( ... ) there is a misguided desire among western policymakers to search for community representatives , which ultimately leads them to identify islamists as more `` authentically '' muslims than those `` other muslims . '', 
  are you sure you read the piece before commenting ? 
  what this piece basically does is arguing against misguided tolerance for islamists and against misguided political respect for islamists . 
   while non-islamists are treated with indifference ; even hostility , islamism , ironically , is handled with much more empathy in some corners of the western world . 
  in this excellent piece , among so many excellent lines , i would highlight this sentence :  there is a misguided desire among western policymakers to search for community representatives , which ultimately leads them to identify islamists as more `` authentically '' muslims than those `` other muslims . '', 
  reminds me to what hamed abdel-samad said last year in a discussion where i participated :  after 9/11 , the german government just wanted `` a telephone number for islam '' at any cost . 
  this surreal idea went on to be the root cause for our problems today . 
  interesting development that cracks appear in the `` permanent war '' narrative which the akp/erdogan government pushes since the summer of 2015 . 
  as media reporting from the civil war in turkey 's southeast is very restricted , and the general audience only learns from occasional attacks in western turkey like the ankara bombings , twitter is a good source of information , i would recommend [ dr partizan ] ( https://twitter.com/drpartizan_ ) as the single most informative account . 
  good thing that the voice of mr snowden is around , he is a major enrichment of public discourse . 
  i like vacationing in greece , among my favorites is crete , and one insight i can contribute is the municipal administration of rethymno . 
  there is a directorate that employs seven people , but only has desks and computers for two . 
  so at any given time , only two of the seven are actually expected to show up ( the amount of actual work these two then do being another issue ) . 
  i have no doubt , however , that the statistic gives this directorate an impressing amount of work hours .
