  and i cherish it not for its kurdishness but for its progressiveness . 
   http://i.imgur.com/9lcwgjs.png  here 's a map of the most common words you have used . 
  fine , that is exactly what i just told you my interest is about . 
   why do you feel the need to comment under any turkey-related post ? 
  because turkey nurturing and supporting jihadi islamists in syria in my humble opinion is the greatest threat ( a ) to modernisation of middle east societies i am academically , professionally and politically interested in , ( b ) to the human species i am a specimen of , ( c ) to the open society in europe and germany i live in and cherish . 
  the topic is done for me on the very day on which turkey categorically stops to nurture and support jihadi islamists in syria . 
  up to now , akp/erdogan could undo only some small fraction of the societal progress of the atat\u00fcrk republic , not more , and all the basics are still there . 
  there was nothing comparable to the 1979 backlash in iran , not least because mustafa kemal pasha did a smart and thorough job , unlike shah reza . 
  i never considered akp/erdogan being in any sense `` progressive '' and warned about it from the outset . 
  if you fell for akp/erdogan propaganda at some point , my friend , you are not well versed in middle eastern politics . 
  to discover what is real agenda and what is only opportunistic facade , my friend , do not listen to sweet words but look at the results . 
  the societal results of atat\u00fcrk rule in turkey and of kck rule in rojava are a progressive leap forward . 
  the societal results of other examples you mention , erdogan rule in turkey , of plo rule in the westbank and of hamas rule in gaza , are regression . 
  shah reza 's iran is a special case which produced some good results but on an unsustainable path that produced a backlash . 
  taking the liberty to [ quote myself ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4c9fb8/pkk_supporters_attack_antiterror_rally_in_germany/d1gb5el ) :  ehm , the kck definitely does fight fgm , not promote it ( there are high rates of fgm among the kurdish society in iraq , where kck has the least influence , by the way ) . 
  but once again : never did i claim that kurdish societies as such were progressive . 
  rather to the opposite , they are among the most regressive backward societies to be found in the middle east , which in itself is among the most regressive backward regions on earth . 
  and it is exactly this against-all-odds background why i , and many civilised people with me , cherish the successful progressive project of the kck so much .

  on what the kck ( the transnational progressive kurdish movement umbrella that includes the pkk ) is about , i would recommend this article [ kurdish syria : a dream of secular utopia in isis ' backyard ] ( http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/dream-secular-utopia-isis-backyard ) and no , i do not condone terror as an instrument to achieve political aims . 
  and i condemn the fact that pretty much every actor in the middle east more or less employs this instrument . 
  on what the kck ( the transnational progressive kurdish movement umbrella that includes the pkk ) is about , i would recommend this article [ kurdish syria : a dream of secular utopia in isis ' backyard ] ( http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/dream-secular-utopia-isis-backyard ), 
  the largest type of citizens of turkey i interact with are second or third generation immigrants who are very kemalist , whose families decided to integrate into being german long ago , and who hold the second turkish passport only for technical and/or sentimental reasons . 
  i always try to convince them to go and vote for chp , but somehow most of them do not want to vote in turkish elections , because they politically self-identify as germans . 
  the second largest type of citizens of turkey i interact with are people of kurdish ethnicity who go and vote hdp . 
  yes there are , the vulgarity of racist supremacist hate against anything kurdish they spew is unparalleled . 
  if you want to make any german despise turks , just point him to the facebook accounts of these people . 
  as [ the pkk has also joined the fight for libreration of mosul ] ( http://www.basnews.com/index.php/en/news/iraq/266453 ) and is already [ making good advances ] ( http://www.kurdishinfo.com/ybs-forces-make-advances-mosul-road ) , will we finally see the two major forces for secular modernisation in the region , the turkish army and the pkk , cooperate instead of fighting each other ? 
  it would be a blessing for the region and a dream come true . 
  only about 40 percent of turkish citizens in germany care to vote at all in turkish elections , which is very low in comparison to turkish diaspora communities elsewhere ( and may be attributed to the fact that many identify more with the german than with the turkish polity ) . 
  this said , quite a lot of the turkish ultra-nationalists in germany voted for akp last november , delighted by the hateful and inciting ultra-nationalist rhetoric erdogan had employed over the summer . 
  [ article in * die zeit * ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-03/demonstration-aschaffenburg-kurden-tuerken ) and [ investigative piece in * ruhrbarone * ] ( http://www.ruhrbarone.de/duisburg-aufmarsch-tuerkischer-nationalisten-eskaliert/124176 ) on the topic , both in german . 
  it appears that there were street fights between turkish `` bozkurt '' ultra-nationalists and pkk supporters both in duisburg and aschaffenburg . 
  many mainstream `` left wing '' people have no problem supporting even the most retarded anti-emancipatory `` right wing '' agenda , as long as it rides under the banner of islam . 
  i gave up trying to understand this crazy long ago . 
  at least european libertarians are willing to fight in defence of progressive liberty . 
  in the isis islamic state , possession of tabacco is prohibited , subject to the penalty of beheading . 
  i like those videos of people whose villages got liberated by the syrian democratic forces and who celebrate smoking their first cigarette after years . 
  actually smoking a cigarette has become , next to removing niqab/hijab , the most powerful image of liberty in the syrian civil war . 
  [ photo artwork `` disparition '' by yemeni photographer bushra almutawakel ] ( https://globalvoices.org/2012/09/09/france-yemen-vanishing-women/ ), 
  let me put it like this : if german politics would fight to eradicate the totalitarian political ideology of islamism with only ten percent of the vigor with which they fight to eradicate smoking in public places including railways , there would be no integration issue and no terrorism threat in germany . 
  are you suggesting that if we europeans are nice to non-european visitors in europe , the world can finally get rid of erdogan ? 
  well , i invited two canadian tourist girls for a coffee earlier today . 
  would you please pass this information to `` your leadership '' ( whoever that is ) , so that mr erdogan can resign ? 
  what an utterly shameful regression of our open society . 
  however , given the background , i think they should amend the rules , women who [ cover their hair by wearing a hijab ] ( http://www.womeninculture.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/bouchra-almutawakel_womeninculture.jpg ) should be allowed to use any carriage they wish . 
  just look at [ this map ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rsqzuikoneo/uqmjylqhixi/aaaaaaaaalo/qqpbhd1wr8e/s1600/cyprus+offshore+on+the+economist.png ) to understand how outrageous absurd [ mr erdogan ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/turkey-erdogan-introduces-new-thought-crimes.html ) 's claims to steal the gas of cyprus are . 
  to understand what vicious an enemy this man is to civilisation , what vicious an enemy this man is to all of us . 
  nurturing islamists as a tool to be used in foreign policy by `` the west '' is the original sin which is driving this curse now upon us . 
  after it appeared to work so well forcing the soviets out of afghanistan , the cynical nonsense concept of `` moderate islamists '' to be nurtured and used in an opportunistic way became a conventional wisdom in many western foreign policy circles . 
  the long path to solve and heal must start with the unambiguous recognition that islamism always , in every shape and form , is evil and must be washed down in the toilet of history . 
  the ugly mob coalition between wahhabi jihadis and turkish ultra-nationalists ( this mob coalition personified by mr erdogan , mr davutoglu and their government ) over the common aim to annihilate any secular or even progressive kurdish movement is the most spooky thing in the middle east today . 
  and [ turkey could do better , by being true to itself ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) . 
  i recommend today 's washington post piece on [ the saudi origins of belgium 's islamist threat ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/03/23/the-roots-of-belgiums-islamist-threat-reach-back-to-saudi-arabia/ ) . 
  and i deeply wish european politics would finally start to act comprehensively and effectively with respect to the threat upon all of us from saudi arabia . 
   analysts point to the inroads made in belgium by the more conservative , orthodox brand of islam espoused by the kingdom of saudi arabia . 
  this is the consequence of actual policy . 
  in 1978 , the saudi-backed great mosque of brussels opened its doors ( ... ) `` today , in brussels , 95 percent of the courses offered on islam for muslims are operated by young preachers trained in saudi arabia , '' michael privot , director of the brussels-based european network against racism , said in an interview with an italian journalist . 
  `` there is a huge demand within muslim communities to know about their religion , but most of the offer is filled by a very conservative salafi type of islam sponsored by saudi arabia . 
  ( ... ) `` wahhabi mosques are financed all over the world by saudi arabia . 
  in germany , many dangerous islamists come from these communities , '' sigmar gabriel , a leading german politician , said in december . 
  an unusually blunt memo , circulated around the same time , from germany 's chief intelligence agency attacked the saudis for the supposedly destabilizing role they play in the middle east and elsewhere . 
  i would recommend the excellent essay `` the religion of our fathers '' ( [ pdf ] ( http://ahmad-mansour.com/wp-content/uploads/the-religion-of-our-fathers-amansour.pdf ) , [ text ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8vyptgkd2tcj:ahmad-mansour.com/ ) ) by ahmad mansour for an insight into the head of people like this woman and the broader `` muslim immigrant '' community in europe . 
  israel has an immigration law which states that anyone who would be considered a jew under the german nazi era [ nuremberg laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuremberg_laws ) is welcome to immigrate and become a citizen of israel ( please note that the traditional jewish definition of jewishness is much narrower ) . 
  this immigration law is meant to provide a homeland for everyone who would be targeted as a jew in the [ holocaust ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust ) and their descendants . 
  i do not think that self-righteous moral indignation about this immigration law is warranted . 
  there is a readworthy essay [ crisis in arab civilization ] ( http://axis-of-goodness.com/2014/02/19/crisis-in-arab-civilization/ ) by leon de winter on the topic of israel and the arab world :  israel has to be destroyed , otherwise some of the core tenets of the islamic religious revelation as described in the koran will be proven to be false -- which is impossible since the koran is allah 's book which has been devised before time existed . 
  according to islamic theology , jews have refused mohammed 's message and therefore are condemned to live within precisely defined limitations as a second-class people . 
  ( ... )  still , western nations should strictly keep on demanding the recognition of israel ; the only way to an islamic reformation , and the road to arab civil societies , lies in the re-interpretation of mohammed 's legacy . 
  an arab nation that can to live with israel will automatically put in motion a cultural and religious reformation . 
  recognition of israel 's existence as a jewish state is the only hope for the arabs and muslims to join the rest of mankind in healing the world . 
  actually the absurd abundance of and belief in conspiracy theories is the most obvious symptom of what is wrong with the arab world . 
  the issue even has [ its own wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conspiracy_theories_in_the_arab_world ) . 
  there is an abundance of insightful articles on the issue , here is some i recommend : [ one ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/pomegranate/2013/11/arab-conspiracy-theories ) , [ two ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/opinion/21iht-edcohen21.html ) , [ three ] ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=4805337 ) , [ four ] ( http://arabist.net/blog/2015/3/19/isis-conspiracy-theories-in-the-arab-media ) . 
  so , should we just find this arab conspiracy theory swamp funny and entertaining ? 
  well , no . 
  there is a real problem with it , as [ this article ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/09/inside-jobs-and-israeli-stooges-why-muslim-world-thrall-conspiracy-theories ) on the topic observes :  where will it end ? 
  when will credulous muslims stop leaning on the conspiracy crutch ? 
  we blame sinister outside powers for all our problems -- extremism , despotism , corruption and the rest -- and paint ourselves as helpless victims rather than independent agents . 
  after all , why take responsibility for our actions when it 's far easier to point the finger at the cia/mossad/the jews/the hindus/fill-in-your - villain-of-choice ? 
  as the egyptian intellectual abd al-munim said once observed , `` the biggest problem with conspiracy theories is that they keep us not only from the truth , but also from confronting our faults and problems . '' they also make us look like loons . 
  can we give it a rest , please ? 
  first of all , since akp rules turkey , the country has been actively encouraging and nurturing islamist hate and terror against `` the west '' . 
  this is quasi official in the case of the [ hamas ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2m_gy-rd_s ) jihadi terror organisation , which is an [ official guest at akp congresses ] ( http://www.jpost.com/international/top-german-mp-merkel-should-condemn-turkey-for-hosting-hamas-official-386205 ) , which is [ comprehensively supported by akp-turkey 's policies ] ( http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-akps-hamas-policy ) . 
  in addition comes the non-official but well-known support of akp-turkey for jihadi islamists in syria , [ including even isis ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/links-between-turkey-and-isis-are-now-undeniable-2015-7 ) . 
  this makes islamist terror in turkey appear as kind of collateral damage of the own government 's policies . 
  and in fact , in the rare cases where islamist terror in turkey has targeted not only foreign ( german , israeli ) tourists but turkish citizens itself , these targets were usually rallies for peace in the turkish-kurdish conflict , with the akp government of turkey itself denying sincere empathy for the victims of these terror attacks . 
  i personally wanted to put up a turkish flag in one of my social media profiles after the isis bombing against an ankara peace rally last october with more than 100 dead , but refrained from doing so when i watched in horror that turkish prime minister davutoglu 's public statements basically suggested that somehow not the jihadi islamist perpetrators , but those secular peaceniks themselves were to blame . 
  this is not a message i want to be associated with . 
  and where terror in turkey is done by kurdish extremists , please keep in mind that there is a fundamental difference in goals when compared to jihadi islamist terrorism . 
  al-qaeda/isis , like all jihadis , attack the universal values of enlightenment and humanism and the universal concept of the open society . 
  the pkk and other kurdish extremists , on the other hand , oppose the policy in turkey of violently oppressing kurds and rejecting autochthonous ethnic minority rights and local self-government ( even beyond the own borders , in syria ! ), 
  for the sake of ultra-nationalism and ultra-centralism . 
  actually both the former ira terror in the uk and the former eta terror in spain , which might be compared with tak terror ( and some elements of pkk ) in turkey , did not draw much empathy from the rest of the world with its victims either . 
  people in other countries mainly thought that these people should seek an arrangement fairly recognizing the interests and mitigating the grievances of the disaffected ethnic group in question instead of fighting . 
  ultimately , the uk and spain went this way . 
  turkey should , too .
