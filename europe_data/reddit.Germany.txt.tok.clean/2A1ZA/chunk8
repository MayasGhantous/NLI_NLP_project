  tl ; dr  false tolerance must end in belgium and everywhere else that harbors large muslim communities . 
  no longer can society shy away from dealing with certain aspects of islam , and its practices must be closely watched . 
  political caution has thus far kept this from happening , but it is here that one must start . 
  such measures dictate the control of mosques , fighting radicalization in prisons and the immediate criminal prosecution of every single `` islamic state '' fighter returning from syria . 
  well , [ turkey should ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ) simply stop nurturing jihadi islamists in syria and elsewhere , that is the one valuable contribution it could and should make to rid both [ turkey itself ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/want-to-laugh-how-turks-chose-stability.aspx?pageid=449&amp;nid=96587&amp;newscatid=398 ) and all people in the world from islamist harassment and terror . 
  i find this `` open letter to isis '' response exemplary : https://twitter.com/tobiashuch/status/712304548803645440, 
  there are zillions of good and workable ideas and concepts for each and every aspect of the challenge . 
  the problem is not a lack of ideas and concepts , the problem is hesitation to clearly state that what mr mohammed reportedly did and spoke in medina was not about religion but about politics . 
  we have to draw a clear line that strips the totalitarian political ideology of islamism from the legal protection of `` religion '' in order to effectively implement ideas and concepts . 
    the open society and liberal democracy ( ... ) will overcome the challenge from islamism  total war is the only chemotherapy that will be effective . 
  ( ... ) are you ready to commit to total war ? 
  ( ... ) are you ready to conduct guerilla operations across the globe and wage proxy wars ? 
  yes to all . 
  i would just point out that this war , while it often has and often will have having the character of bloody armed conflict , in its core is a war about hearts and minds , about the soul of societies . 
  the most important victories will not be won on the field of battle , but in studies , townhalls , and bedrooms . 
  my opinion is that promoting open society and washing the totalitarian political ideology of islamism down in the toilet of history should be number one priority of both national and international policies in the 21st century . 
  i do not think that mankind and any man can sustainably live well as long as islamism is still around on the globe . 
   for an islamist , the politics is religion . 
  exactly . 
  and for us , it is two separate realms . 
  we should not let ourselves be drawn into their dark , foul , sticky swamp . 
  it is one of our major sources of strength that we stay clean of that . 
  the open society and liberal democracy did overcome the challenge from nazism , did overcome the challenge from leninism , and will overcome the challenge from islamism as well . 
  actually open society and liberal democracy have not only intellectually convincing but also highly effective means to overcome and wash down the totalitarian political ideology of islamism in the toilet of history . 
  i agree with you , however , that our political class has failed to apply these means for the past decades . 
  a misguided ideology of `` multiculturalism '' has taken root , that allowed parallel societies based on and dominated by the totalitarian political ideology of islamism to grow , here in our homeland . 
  this idea of `` multiculturalism '' must be buried for open society to win and survive , i agree with that . 
  how do you define `` being muslim '' ? 
  using the term does not do any good in political discourse . 
  the only effect it has is pushing the islamist narrative that `` all people with a background in islamic societies '' would have to support and fight for the totalitarian political ideology of islamism , for the horrible rule of horrible sharia . 
  are you aware that the people who are fighting most fiercly against islamism every day and every hour , all over the world , are `` muslims '' themselves under that definition of `` all people with a background in islamic societies '' ? 
  here is an article i recommend , [ invisible atheists : the spread of disbelief in the arab world ] ( https://newrepublic.com/article/121559/rise-arab-atheists ), 
  the equivalent to * nazi * is * islamist * . 
  both terms belong into political discourse ( where the term * muslim * does not belong ) , because both terms , * nazi * and * islamist * , denote vicious enemies of the open society , based on the respective totalitarian political ideologies of nazism and islamism . 
  the term you seek is * jihadis * , that is narrower to denote those * islamists * who undertake to implement sharia rule with armed aggression . 
  however , in my opinion , it would be a huge mistake to focus on jihadis only . 
  the root problem is the totalitarian political ideology of [ islamism ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/41hujg/difference_between_islamist_salafist/cz2jvo7 ) as such . 
  just as we do not tolerate non-violent forms of nazism , we may not tolerate non-violent forms of islamism . 
  both ideologies are vicious enemies of the open society . 
  no , we are not `` falling down '' . 
  the war of the totalitarian political ideology of islamism against the open society will be bitter and will regrettably take many lives of good people . 
  and in the end the open society will be victorious , and we will wash down the totalitarian political ideology of islamism in the toilet of history . 
  please refrain from using the term `` muslims '' in a political discussion , this term belongs exclusively to the realm of personal religion . 
  it serves only the totalitarian political ideology of islamism to abuse this term for politics . 
  and the neighbourhoods where such terror against the open society is celebrated are neighbourhoods of the parallel society based on and dominated by the totalitarian political ideology of islamism . 
  [ edit ] as some readers appear unfamiliar with the terminology : the proper and generally used term for an adherent to the totalitarian political ideology of islamism is `` islamist '' . 
  this is the term that does belong to political discourse , to denote vicious enemies of the open society . 
  what makes me a bit sad is that many people , who want to fight islamism , and rightly so , do not understand that they just help the enemy by using the term `` muslim '' in political discussion ( irrespective of the connotation ) . 
  the city of brussels these days is an argument and exhibit for the case that parallel societies based on and dominated by the totalitarian political ideology of islamism should not be allowed to exist in open society europe . 
  the now defunct `` pirate party '' here in germany , and their faction in berlin in particular , tried that concept of total transparency of political process and bitterly failed . 
  whatever more information you make public , whatever more meeting you livestream , there will always be aspects which people involved want to discuss without the whole world listening , and they will always find avenues for that . 
  and from a game theory perspective , there is a huge advantage and benefit for those who do . 
  this said , i support the idea of transparency of the political process . 
  but that is a very different issue from the issue discussed in this thread , namely the private sphere of ordinary citizens . 
  there are so many papers and articles around on how to get the greek tax collection system on first world level . 
  here are just four as an example : [ one ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/24/greece-collecting-revenue-tax-evasion ) , [ two ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/10/07/greece-to-combat-tax-evasion-with-midnight-raids-german-style/ ) , [ three ] ( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greece-pledges-rid-tax-evasion-150445104.html ) , [ four ^ pdf ] ( http://www.bankofgreece.gr/bogekdoseis/paper2015193.pdf ), 
  what really bothers me is that quite some people join the praise that more general surveillance of citizens means less crime so more surveillance must be good , and still more surveillance must be even better . 
  do these people not understand what the ultimate corollary and consequence of this argument is , `` zero crime by total surveillance '' ? 
  there are better ways to combat tax evasion than total surveillance of every payment . 
  countries other then greece , for example germany , have systems that work pretty well . 
  and the extreme measure of abolishing cash would not eliminate the black economy either , people would find other valuables to trade . 
  absolutely agree with this article . 
  the fight for cash as one payment option is an important fight for liberty and opportunity in the 21st century . 
  there is an increasing chorus , including security experts from all quarters and turkey opposition leader kemal kilicdaroglu , that the islamist leanings and the negligence of the akp/erdogan regime have allowed a huge network of isis activists , sympathizers and sleeper cells in turkey to develop . 
  let 's hope that now determined action against the jihadi networks and their totalitarian political ideology of islamism is taken . 
  my optimism is limited , however . 
  it was revealing that after this istanbul terror attack , erdogan immediately boasted that they were bombing the kurds with additional vigor now , but after it turned out isis was responsible , no more word about retaliation or at least a plan to counter jihadi terrorism ( and an official of his akp party even expressed a widespread akp attitude by tweeting she wished that more israelis had died in that terror attack ) . 
  i am neither kurdish nor persian ( the term iranian is the term encompassing both , and some other ethnicities ) . 
  these discussions here on / r/europe make me wonder when i will have to put my grandparents ' nazi era aryan certificates online to prove my pure german ethnic heritage to the 18th century . 
  strange kind of people here . 
  i post this here because i have seen and heard , written and spoken dozens of nowruz greetings all day , and so i posted it here as well . 
  berlin is a cosmopolitan place , and me and many other people living here enjoy that . 
  celebrating the beginning of spring as with the ancient iranian tradition of newroz/nowruz is arguably more `` native '' to europe than christian holidays . 
  just some food for thought . 
  when reading this article [ refugees celebrate persian new year in berlin church ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2016/03/refugees-celebrate-persian-year-berlin-church-160319130350158.html ) on al jazeera , i am glad that people here in my city berlin do not share your xenophobia . 
  [ persian new year , or nowruz , explained for non-persians ] ( http://www.vox.com/2016/3/20/11265872/persian-new-year-nowruz ), 
  there are many millions of iranian people living and celebrating [ newroz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nowruz ) in our diverse europe . 
  everybody in germany is congratulating to their new year . 
  i do not think this subreddit should be xenophobic and forbid that . 
   what you are saying is turkey should let the so called progressive kurdish movement fill the country with feminist suicide bombers until it becomes a proper democracy . 
  turkey should also look the other way while the armed pro-lgtb militants declare autonomy in se cities of turkey this strawman nonsense has nothing to do with what i say . 
  i do advocate reforming the constitutional framework towards enhanced liberal democracy including meaningful local self government . 
  and i advocate a less hostile and brute , more sane and intelligent approach towards non-violent activists and politicians associated with progressive kurdish movement . 
  i advocate the opposite of indicting and imprisoning mr demirtas . 
  i advocate recognizing the fact that people like leyla imret are not a threat but a historic opportunity for turkey . 
   you know that turkey did try making a peace with pkk right ? 
  i do not cherish that past pkk-negotiations of mr erdogan . 
  and the problem in my view is not that every side cautiously prepared for the case that civil war might come back , this is just regular political business . 
  the main problem was that erdogan never was sincere about these negotiations , he just wanted \u00d6calan to agree to his obsession with a sultanistic presidency , and everything else or consequences of his conduct he did not care about , he made every promise the pkk wanted to hear but never delivered anything ( the promised amnesty law as a most obvious example ) . 
  and fundamentally , a mutual co-operative , forward-looking peace with the progressive kurdish movement needs a much broader approach than secretive bazaar like negotiations of erdogan advisors with selected pkk people . 
  i absolutely agree with you that this is a long journey ( in my humble opinion the issue of accomodating libertarian ideas , attitudes of non-authoritarianism , self-government of communities is even more tricky than the turkish/kurdish thing ) , and exactly for this reason it should be started quickly and broadly , with determination . 
  it was revealing that after this istanbul terror attack , erdogan immediately boasted that they were bombing the kurds with additional vigor now , but after it turned out isis was responsible , no more word about retaliation or at least a plan to counter jihadi terrorism . 
  and an official of his akp party even tweeting she wished that more israelis had died in that terror attack . 
  please stop this strawman nonsense , it gets boring . 
  i absolutely wish that turkey would not `` sit idle while being attacked '' , but rather start to ( a ) comprehensively root out the totalitarian political ideology of islamism including the plethora of isis sleeper cells in turkey , and ( b ) make a mutual co-operative , forward-looking peace with the progressive kurdish movement , thus draining the motivation for terrorism from that corner . 
  i recommend this excellent article [ `` how can turkey overcome its foreign policy mess ? 
  '' ] ( http://lobelog.com/how-can-turkey-overcome-its-foreign-policy-mess/ ), 
  everybody knows by now that for erdogan , `` terrorism '' includes anything that disturbs his glory of absolute sultanistic power , like media reporting on his support for jihadis in syria , citizens rallying for civic freedoms in turkey , courts applying the law in an independent way , academics suggesting that a fair balance of interests and mutual peace might be a better answer to the kurdish issue than ever more oppression and bombs , or people simply making a joke about his person on social media . 
  and so everybody understands his quote in this context . 
  do we agree that not only hamas , but also fatah/plo , at least as of 2016 , are not `` progressive '' but cleptocratic-feudalist and dominated to the roots by the ideology of totalitarian islamism ?
