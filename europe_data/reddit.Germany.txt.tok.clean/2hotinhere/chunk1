  most of them are just migrants from `` safe '' balkan countries . 
  do n't confuse migrants with refugees . 
   in reality germany buys their honey wholesale from china which is extremely low-quality shit , import it to germany , then put it in a fancy design bottle , slap a `` made in germany '' sticker on it and say it is high quality germany honey . 
  man , this should be stopped immediately . 
  i do not want to check every product if its really `` made in germany '' when im at the supermarket . 
   and some of them get a german label and are re-exported outside the eu as `` made in germany '' . 
  source please . 
   our exports grow by 11 % in a year , while german gdp grows only around 1,5 % annually . 
  comparing those two makes no sense at all . 
  well , thats the downside of wanting cheaper cars and high salaries in this industry at the same time . 
  they start producing outside of their home countries . 
  well , that is some stupid statement . 
  the world is not black and white . 
  this was a response to / u/redteddy23 . 
  i will complete my sentence so everyone will understand : well , there is no need to import electricity from new polish nuclear power plants near the border . 
  she is chancellor since 2005 and most germans want her to stay , according to forsa poll for stern . 
  well , there is no need to import electricity . 
  in fact we export most of the time . 
  well makes the most sense i guess . 
  no jokes , just w\u00f6rk .

   finally gives some germans a way to feel good yes , i waited my entire life to feel good . 
  thanks `` zeit '' , you got me out of depression . 
   fundamental stupidity of the plans as i am not a professional economist , i would rather let the eurozone finance ministers , the european central bank , the federal ministry of finance and the german federal bank decide this . 
  i could n't care less if my image is damaged because i am not as generous as other people expect from me .

  what other sources do you need ? 
  im not . 
  konrad adenauer wasnt participating in debt talkings in 1953/54 . 
   here is a picture of the greek finance minister writing off half of germany 's debts and allowing the other half to be paid only by export surplus which led to the `` german miracle '' false , this picture shows konrad adenauer and konstantinos karamanlis 1958 in berlin giving greece a loan . 
  get your facts straight . 
  google translate :  greek prime minister constantine karamanlis held from 10 to 13 november 1958 for talks with adenauer in the federal republic of germany , in the result of the lending in the amount of dm 200 million was agreed . 
  why should she ? 
  because of his hardine attitude sch\u00e4ubles popularity is at an all time high . 
  quote from the german federal foreign office : `` france is germany 's closest and most important partner in europe . 
  with no other country does it coordinate all its policies more extensively or regularly . '', 
  i think this quote reflects the german public opinion pretty well ... thats at least my impression .

  do you watch it with the german intro or without ? 
  just curious . 
  are you going to ask the us for help again ? 
  focus.de its the first time since the cold war . 
  first the government told us germans to stockpile food and water , want to increase the defense budget to $ 70 billion and now harder/new sanctions against russia . 
  something 's up . 
  does n't change a bit in absolute terms . 
  that would be $ 70 billion , the fourth biggest military budget on the planet . 
  bigger than the russian military budget .

  you mean like [ those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kommando_spezialkr\u00e4fte ) guys ? 
  im sure they are well trained and can handle a little bit more than carrying sandbags .

  good joke , lad . 
  what does military power even mean in this debate ? 
  is hollande going to invade eu countries that are n't willing to cooperate or what do you imply ? 
  article 50 : `` a member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the european council of its intention . '', 
  lawyers said this notification can be a call or the referendum itself . 
  there do n't need to be a formal letter . 
  therefore the eu can just decide that the two years period begins now . 
  thats neither hate preach , nor is it my target to shape you opinion . 
  i was simply expressing my opinion and my observations . 
  and between `` to be nice '' and a friendship lies a huge gap ( correct english ? 
  so , why is the us that heavily armed ? 
  surely not to simply defend your country . 
  its about global influence . 
  and showing your muscles is not really a peaceful gesture . 
  beside , no offense , the us has been at war  90 % of the time since 1776 .

  well , to be honest : when someone mentions european friendship , poland is not the first country that comes to my mind . 
  and the heartwarming polish comments in this thread confirms it - same thing on the other side . 
  and thats okay for me . 
  in my opinion der spiegel exaggerated ( correct term ? ), 
  a little bit . 
  its one sided actually . 
   the united kingdom 's withdrawal from the eu would be a disaster for germany while it would be bad economically , it sounds like der spiegel wants to declare germany as the one that will fall into recession in case of brexit , not gb itself . 
   europeans do n't give two shits about democracy / r/shitamericanssay /, 
  you seem to know a lot about germany . 
  maybe i should ask my parents and former teachers why they did not teach me to hate my ancestors .

   a greek debt writedown might not be popular in the bundestag but another eurozone crisis would be a political disaster for her . 
  i doubt that . 
  another bailout or debt cut for greece will result in a higher domestic political disaster for her .
