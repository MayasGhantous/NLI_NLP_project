i guess you could -- at least an approximation without the umlauts . 
  so , that saucy drawing is from the ottoman period , which is quite unspecific . 
  is there any info about what it is about -- except the funny ouroboros of cocks drawing ? 
  what does the text say ? 
  yawn , your spam is getting old . 
  that makes sense . 
  hence my quotation marks . 
  the clothing ( or what 's left ) would fit ; i just neither know turkish ( except like 2 words ) nor arabic , so i wanted to play it safe . 
  an `` arabic '' drawing to represent the eu ... oh the irony . 
  7 billion people found guilty of being un-turkish . 
  / s r.t. should play goat simulator instead of wasting everyone 's precious time . 
  edit : typo, 
   and that 's the stranger . 
  ... if he sat long enough on it , that is . 
  it 's funny how they do n't even get the word `` dienstrang '' ( rank ) in the id right . 
  i mean , if these weirdos want to play `` deutsches reich '' then they should at least be in command of their own mother tongue . 
  maybe someone should call [ markus ettlinger ] ( http://www.marvunapp.com/appendix/vormundcap.htm ) and ask him to give these `` reichtsb\u00fcrger '' a good spanking . 
  i 'd say berlin and heidelberg are good candidates , if you ask me .

  learning alphabets is a matter of days ; it 's the easiest part . 
  source : i had to learn the japanese `` syllable alphabets '' katakana and hiragana with roughly 40 `` letters '' each in a few days . 
  cyrillic is also easy if you already know the greek alphabet . 
  learned them in this order : german , latin , english , french , japanese . 
  latin is a dead language , but useful to understand romance languages , although i have forgotten an awful lot of it . 
  my french sucks really bad , and i 've forgotten most of the japanese i learned at uni . 
  so ... german and english it is !, 
  thanks !, 
  i remember how i watched this on the news , in utter disbelief , thinking `` poor gorbi '' . 
  and seeing the tanks immediately reminded me of the tiananmen massacre that happened just 4 years before . 
  i was 19 back then . 
  so , it certainly was reported in germany . 
  maybe it was overshadowed by the war in yugoslavia , the gulf , and other newsworthy events , like the rwandan genocide that happened in the following year . 
  these were eventful times , long before 9/11 , which a lot of people seem to have forgotten . 
  v is only pronunced as a soft consonant [ v ] in words of foreign origin . 
  vase , viper , virus , vaseline are such words . 
  in these words , v is pronounced like [ f ] . 
  w is always pronounced like [ v ] in german . 
  b\u00f6hmermann is clearly imitating werner herzog 's accent and speech pattern . 
  and he 's really good at it . 
  it 's just another layer of satire , copying the narrative style herzog uses in his documentaries . 
  just [ listen to herzog 's narration ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwh_9vrwn8y ) , around 50 seconds into the video . 
  and if you are n't convinced yet , just [ watch his performance in jack reacher ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_2u11z1lju ) . 
  mine is duckduckgo . 
  i 'm not so fond of google 's personalized internet bubble . 
  not all sayings are directly from ancient times . 
  there are several common german phrases that originated e.g. 
  besides , a lot of norse mythology also found its way into our cultural heritage via stories , myths , fairy tales etc. 
  and these also existed long before the brothers grimm and others collected them . 
  and by the way , i was n't really serious in my previous comment . 
  i thought the percentages would give it away . 
  apparently they did n't . 
  so , just imagine a **  ** or ** / i ** behind it , if it helps . 
  ah , that would make sense . 
  it 's been decades since i read them , so i might have confused this one . 
  i guess in germany it 's 30 % aesop , 40 % goethe , 20 % bible , and the rest edda and other sources , 
  this is what richard feynman related to when he talked about cargo cult science . 
  '' * he , who digs a pit for others , shall fall into it himself . 
  '' * steady drips hollow the stone . 
  '' * the mountain was in labor and gave birth to a mouse . 
  all these prases are n't that unique , i think . 
  some come from the bible , so it 's not surprising . 
  people nowadays might find them untranslatable because they lost the knowledge of their own cultural roots . 
  this day is also a protestant holiday , as i already mentioned . 
  even more so because of that 500 years protestantism thing you might have heard of . 
  you know , once upon a time there was a man named martin luther ... maybe just google the relevance of reformation day in european protestantism . 
   since halloween is not a christian holyday it 's a protestant holiday , also known as reformation day in germany . 
  and it 's also a christian holiday in general , just not exclusively christian . 
  the name of the day itself should be a dead giveaway . 
  when i was a kid , i was still trick-or-treating around karneval/mardi gras , which kids today do n't do anymore ( not where i live ) . 
  halloween has been taking that place during the last 10 to 15 years . 
  27 upvotes ... perfect . 
  it 's * tschechien * in german , so czechia would sound nice and familiar to us , 
  look at it this way : the small region of wallonia is playing a game . 
  and because the vote for accepting ceta has to be unanimous the other 500,000,000 people of the eu are taken hostage by a handful of people . 
  that 's a far cry from 7 years of work being fucked up . 
  belgium better gets its ridiculous problems between the 3 regions sorted , that 's how i see this . 
  the stance of wallonia has nothing to do with the quality of the negotiations between the eu and canada , and the eu wo n't just let 7 years of negotiations be wasted . 
  and it 's not the first time that some member did not agree to something , and i think it will get sorted out . 
  hell , it was the default mode for the uk to operate on , and the eu still got things done , right ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  the negotiations are successfully finished , and there is no problem with them . 
  the problem is the ratification by a single region in one of the 28 member states . 
  edit : word, 
  the negotiations wo n't be easy . 
  punishment has nothing to do with it . 
  ceta negotiations took 7 years iirc , and nobody was trying to punish anyone . 
  trade negotiations are no easy matter , and negotiators do n't give a damn about the dumb rhetorics of day-to-day politics . 
  the most important issue is that the uk better get enough good trade negotiators because the eu has no shortage of these . 
  plus , they just gave proof again for the oh so benevolent syrian governmet 's \u00fcse of chemical weapons , for the third time . 
  honestly ? 
  because i had in the back of my head that it was a nasa-esa collaboration . 
  my bad . 
  do n't take it personally . 
  i 'm not trying to `` shame '' nasa . 
  what an odd choice of words , by the way . 
  to be honest , after reading the article in full again , the collaborator jpl messed up . 
  besides , which agency launches a satellite does n't really matter . 
  and collaborations of space agencies exist , so it 's not so much a matter of who 's got the biggest space dick anyway . 
  despite the downvote nasa still is not a military agency . 
  no , nasa is an independent agency of the executive branch of the us government .
