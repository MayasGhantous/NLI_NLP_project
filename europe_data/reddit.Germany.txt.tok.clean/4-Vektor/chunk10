  that 's obvious . 
  the german equivalent would be : https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/m/mv5bmjiynzc0mzc1mf5bml5banbnxkftztcwmtgxmzmzmw@@._v1_sx1777_cr0,0,1777,999_al_.jpg, 
  awww , how cute . 
  i wouldn have thought that i would ever say that about trump . 
  i would n't write anything but cursive or s\u00fctterlin with my [ pelikan * souver\u00e4n schwarz * ] ( https://www.pelikan.com/pulse/pulsar/de_de.fwi.displayshop.94099./souveraen-schwarz ) fountain pen , using my beloved rohrer & klinger * leipziger schwarz * ( leipsician black ) ink . 
  so much whataboutism in this thread . 
  welome to / r/europe . 
  what about ... 
  well said !, 
  sweet baby jesus , you seem to participate in this thread only to throw around the word ** pledge ** as often as possible . 
  did you lose a bet or what 's your problem ? 
  no , it 's because there 's a line '' ... otherwise the huntsman will get you with his rifle . '', 
  ( ... sonst wird dich der j\u00e4ger holen mit dem schie\u00dfgewehr ... ) you know ... animal cruelty or nonsense like that . 
  that 's peta level stupidity . 
  [ approximately 590,000 ] ( http://www.share-international.org/archives/homelessness/hl-abgermany.htm ) . 
  860,000 if you include immigrants , according to that website . 
  happens once a day in germany on average . 
  250 kg is not massive . 
  everything 500 kg and bigger is interesting , 
  and belgium is a nice city . 
  we do n't have bears , we only have damagebears  oh , these `` schadb\u00e4ren '' are a special breed . 
  this reminds me of the old ( now retired ) and new henrichenburg boat lifts ( [ schiffshebewerk henrichenburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henrichenburg_boat_lift ) ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytyul3mqpko ) is some old footage from 1929 , showing the old boat lift in action . 
  it 's a museum now . 
  good old bystander syndrome . 
  your argument is quite weak because religion is declining and none of what you describe is part of a civil partnership . 
   the notion of being restricted to one sexual partner for a month [ ... ] is an affront to free will and humanity . 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  you might reconsider what free will and humanity actually mean . 
  it 's fine if you are unable to focus your cock on one person longer than a month , but do n't think you are the norm , nor that staying monogamous is against free will in general or inhuman . 
  it 's worth it either way . 
  it shows that the general population does not support the decree , even if it would n't get withdrawn . 
  and that sends a signal to all of europe , that the fish is rotting from the head down , not from the bottom up . 
   america just only has two viable parties that constrain people and voters to settling for the lowest common denominator yeah , there is no coalition building in fptp voting systems , in contrast to any forms of proportional representation where more and smaller parties usually have to build coalitions and work towards compromises . 
  if at all , the two ( rather similar ) parties in the us present themselves ( artificially ) as polar opposites of a scale , and compromises are rather uncommon . 
  change of the political landscape is also very unlikely . 
  gerrymandering and several other problems ( remembering the shitshow how some electors got voted for ) make it even worse . 
  fun fact : josef stefan bech was a huge fan of mozard . 
  the genocide in rwanda was done with machetes only . 
  knives were good enough to kill 800,000 tutsi in 3 months . 
  edit : just switch `` knife '' with `` truck '' , and it 's obvious that the tool alone does not define what 's terrorism or what is n't . 
  wonderful !, 
  congratulations , romania . 
  eric cartman ... that 's a fantastic comparison !, 
  ukip are surprisingly thin-skinned if you consider how much farage loves to insult meps . 
  i still remember the funny facepalm of the former heart surgeon mep as a reaction to farage 's `` most of the members of this parliament have never actually worked in their lives '' ... i 'm paraphrasing , of course . 
  farage is a rude cunt -- and has always been -- he better swallow the rather modest `` insults '' by other meps . 
  these kids are so edgy , they 're gon na cut themselves . 
  lol back to startpage , then, 
  i 've been using duckduckgo exclusively for 2 or 3 years now . 
  sometimes i use ixquick , too . 
  i never regretted my switch to duckduckgo . 
  yeah , sometimes u is used instead of the correct \u00b5 , if greek letters ca n't be written . 
  it 's barbaric , but oh well ... , 
  yeah , how english speakers pronounce it . 
  in german , we pronounce it like m\u00fc , which sounds like the ancient greek pronunciation [ my\u02d0 ] . 
  is that a cow with a speech impediment ? 
  neither ancient greek [ my\u02d0 ] nor modern greek [ mi ] sound like what cows usually produce  must be an american cow that ca n't pronounce greek letters properly . 
  waiting for the trumpets to comment on this . 
  let me get some popcorn ... 
  i 'm afraid is is n't . 
  take my upvote . 
  lame . 
  i 'd prefer an animation of sheep-shagging whales . 
  unpossible !, 
  brilliant !, 
  sure , it 's authentic in the sense that it 's a real building . 
  yet , it is n't a castle in the sense of ... a castle . 
  my goodness , this thing looks fake as fuck . 
  you wrote devolved wrong . 
  back to troll school , trollie95 . 
  you still need some training . 
  check his name . 
  hint : it 's ** trollie95 ** , 
  at least you did n't call anyone an idiot this time . 
  there is hope . 
  and thanks for the compliment . 
  it 'll get probably better once you 're older than 14 . 
  3 of 47 died a `` possibly natural death '' . 
  that 's reassuring . 
  does anyone still use truecrypt ? 
  i mean , veracrypt has been around for a while , and it has been audited . 
  til i live near calgary , 
  the moon sounds good . 
  a saudi guy is already planning to shoot the first book ever up to the moon -- guess which book . 
  yep . 
  she was even only 15 when she did it . 
  she got radicalized from age 7 onwards . 
  i would love to see she could got proper deprogramming and treatment just to show the islamist cunts that they did n't win . 
  these fuckers also target mentally unstable and ill persons to do their dirty work . 
  she should be a social worker pulling radicalized kids out of their surroundings -- that would perfect . 
  in the meanwhile her parents and pierre vogel and his cohorts should end up in prison for a long time-isolated from one another and other easy targets of their simplistic and poisonous ideology . 
  yes , it 's most likely just a dream , but it would be awesome nonetheless . 
  autocorrect failure fixed : bit \u2192 out, 
  ... because the eu already * is * great . 
  [ spanish movies ] ( http://www.shmoop.com/spanish-colonization/movies-tv.html ) [ colonialism at the movies ] ( https://orangemanor.wordpress.com/2009/09/06/colonialism-at-the-movies-by-thomas-benjamin-and-doina-harsayni-part-2/ ) these are the two i could find so far on my phone . 
  i 'll have a look on my pc later . 
  typing on the phone is just a pain . 
  the second link seems to contain info about quite a lot of international movies dealing with the topic . 
   no knowledge about sex nor marriage nor family you do n't get around much , do you ?
