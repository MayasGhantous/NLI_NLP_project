  at least some priests seem to have some experience with little boys . 
  / s on a more serious note : in the catholic church , you can become a deacon ( which is like being a priest v. 0.9 ) if you are married , and you can have kids . 
  ironically , you ca n't marry if you are a deacon . 
  one of the mysteries of church law , lol .

  i would say germany did n't give up on him one minute too early . 
  lem is just great , and golem xiv is one of my favorite books . 
  lem never spoke in absolute terms and he brought his points across without a frothing mouth , but level-headed and going deeper than just scratching the surface . 
  his essays about the societal consequences of technological developments are deeper more profound than anything kurzweil or other transhumanism advocates have been able to come up with -- and that multiple decades before them . 
  maybe her family/party tradition , with her dad who always was a rabid antisemite , might be seen as ... kiiind of right of the center . 
   immigrants are n't the only topic this party has ... dealt with . 
  dad had to go , too . 
  he was too open about certain topics ( jews ) and was a threat because he made the party rather unpopular among people who did n't see themselves as open antisemites . 
  the name le pen has a history , for good reasons . 
  patriotism is a bit meager for a working policy . 
  til russians are not able to use condoms properly . 
  and in the meanwhile , 1 in 7 americans are functionally illiterate : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/06/illiteracy-rate_n_3880355.html in some cities the functional illiteracy rate is up to 47 % ( detroit ) . 
  the massive split between the super rich and poor is second to none in the us as well . 
   well germany also has a lot of vegans/vegetarians this morning , i heard some figures on the radio in a science program about domesticated animals and food production : a little less than 10 % of germans are vegetarians and less than 1 % are vegan . 
  i have no idea how these numbers compare to other countries , though . 
  nobody wants to hear the truth , and even fewer people will do something about it . 
  i think it 's the latest oxfam report . 
  basically , the 62 richest people owning as much as half the earth 's poorest population shrunk down to even fewer , richer people , like gates , zuckerberg and a handful of others . 
  i 'm paraphrasing what i heard on the radio news yesterday , so take it with a grain of salt . 
  @ * ! k yeah !, 
  you @ * ! king hit the @ * ! king nail on the @ * ! king head , man !, 
  that 's no news , to be honest . 
  it 's the same with the us and their puritan heritage . 
  well , with the difference that you do n't need to keep an industry of cutting off baby foreskins alive for getting horse piss . 
  if the historical evidence i gave you does n't suffice and you resort to nitpicking , enjoy !, 
  so ... what 's your stance on the historical relevance of dr. kellogg again ? 
  i mean , everytime you see articles about the history of circumcision in the us , you see one name : dr. kellogg i guess that 's because he was irrelevant , right ? 
  by the way , you called me racist , which is ignorant . 
  and wrong . 
  anyways , i guess this discussion is futile , so have a nice day , good sir !, 
  edit : oh , by the way ...  it 's sort of a lie to claim americans remove their foreskins because freaky dr. kellogg said so . 
  i never wrote they remove their foreskins because dr. kellogg * said so * . 
  so , before you call me a racist ( ridiculous ) and a liar ( that 's a lie ) , better check what you write as well . 
  you wrote :  like me showing the crazy ramblings of some historical cult figure , and saying that is why these people do those things . 
  what i said :  i did n't say that people nowadays get circumcised to prevent them from masturbating , but that 's the actual reason why circumcision is a ( now declining ) widespread practice in the us . 
  yeah , that 's totally racist . 
  let 's stay with facts , then . 
  as you say that kellogg is of no importance in the whole story , let 's see what [ psychology today ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/circumcision-social-sexual-psychological-realities ) has to say about it :  * myth : circumcision is an important tradition that has been going on forever . 
  *  * reality check : in the united states , circumcision was n't popularized until victorian times , when a few doctors began to recommend it to prevent children from masturbating . 
  dr. kellogg ( of corn flakes fame ) advocated circumcision for pubescent boys and girls to stop masturbation : `` a remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision , especially when there is any degree of phimosis . 
  the operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an an\u00e6sthetic , as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind , especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment ... 
  in females , the author has found the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris an excellent means of allaying the abnormal excitement '' ( kellogg 1877 ) . 
  circumcision caught on among the sex-negative victorians , but only wealthy parents could afford it . 
  in 1932 , only 31 % of men were circumcised ; this peaked around 85 % in 1980 , and has been dropping ever since ( laumann 1997 , wallerstein 1980 ) . 
  far from an ancient tradition , it was only popular in post-war america ; think of it as `` your parent 's body mod . 
  * by the way , i did n't know the us are a race . 
  my dictionary must be wrong . 
  for example  `` the current medical rationale for circumcision developed after the operation was in wide practice . 
  the original reason for the surgical removal of the foreskin , or prepuce , was to control ` masturbatory insanity ' -- the range of mental disorders that people believed were caused by the ` polluting ' practice of ` self-abuse . ' '', 
  the medical rationale of today came after introducing the practice for moral ( and mental health ) reasons . 
  the main reason is non-medical . 
  and masturbation is a common theme , even in the early medical rationale . 
  i did n't say that people nowadays get circumcised to prevent them from masturbating , but that 's the actual reason why circumcision is a ( now declining ) widespread practice in the us . 
  and you can say thanks to dr. kellogg ( as the most prominent person ) for that , among other contemporary proponents of this practice , of course . 
  history seems to tell us you 're wrong : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_male_circumcision#revival_in_the_english-speaking_world kellogg was one of the avid promoters leading to the revival of circumcision in the us . 
  hell , even the reasons given in the article are the same as the ones given by kellogg : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_male_circumcision#masturbation_concerns edit : it is possible that people ** today ** are oblivious about the reasons why circumcision is even a thing in the us , but that 's not contradicting the reason for it becoming a thing in the first place . 
  i mean , the clich\u00e9 reason i 've heard often is dads saying `` his penis should look like mine . '' , which is quite ridiculous , of course . 
  they would n't push for any other surgery to make their boys look more like themselves ... but their penises are of concern . 
  plain weird . 
  science was a bit chaotic back then , but let 's not forget that around that time other scientists existed , too ... like sigmund freud , who even postulated the existence of libido , also recognizing its crucial role in our lives , and had a way less hostile stance towards sexuality , for example . 
  let 's see what wikipedia has to say about it  ... on the basis of dangers both scientifically understood at the time -- as in sexually transmissible diseases -- ** and those taught by the seventh-day adventist church ** . 
  not religious at all . 
  it 's a fun read , is n't it ? 
  circumcision is a big industry in the us , and them ladies love a nice piece of baby cock on their wrinkly faces . 
  sounds weird ? 
  it is . 
  say thanks to dr. kellogg and his obsession with masturbation prevention , enemas etc. . . yes , the guy who invented the cornflakes . 
  strangely , his idea how to prevent girls from masturbating did n't catch on . 
  sad , but true . 
   you 're an idiot if you do n't know proper grammer it 's ** grammar ** ; and you start sentences with a capital letter , ~ ~ mr. 
  idiot ~ ~ good sir . 
  no humppa in it ? 
  must be fake . 
  why does he say `` germany '' if he means `` bavaria '' ? 
  i wish this buffoon would shut up every once in a while . 
  germany must stay germany -- he could n't come up with anything less banal and empty of meaning , i guess . 
  it 's painful to watch all these politicians cater to the lowest common right-wing denominator . 
  they 're really out of ideas and have no plan whatsoever -- all of them . 
  brace yourselves for more pre-election bullshit coming from all sides . 
  and horst will stay at the forefront of hollow rants . 
  they better start their genetic experiments with sharks , too . 
  what use is a laser without a shark ? 
  that 's what prof. michael dougan already mentioned before the referendum . 
  the uk has no negotiators worth mentioning , and those they have are not up to the task . 
  only barbarians use cheap or mediocre wine for cooking . 
  good mother !, 
  i 'm not a vegetarian , but thanks for teaching a lesson in ethics an moral high horses , i guess . 
  i just tried to imagine a reason why a vegetarian night still like something to taste similar to meat . 
  another little hint : umami is a sensation even vegetarians enjoy . 
  i guess you 'll have another aggressive reply to that . 
  did a vegetarian do you any harm in the past or why are you so angry ? 
  maybe you like meat and its wonderful taste but do n't eat it for ideological or ethical reasons . 
  ** should of ** is as much about spelling as a hypothetical ** kind 've ** would be .
