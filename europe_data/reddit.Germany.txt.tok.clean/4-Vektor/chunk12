  it 's just retarded . 
  ** of ** means something different than ** have ** , and it does n't even work as a cotraction . . ** mispeling ** would be a spelling error , ** could of ** is n't . 
  i know that language changes ; we 're not speaking old saxon anymore ( or old german in my case ) , but most of the time this is used as a lame excuse for a lack of basic education or low effort . 
  nevermind . 
  sorry for my rant . 
  it 's not really strange . 
  it 's rather saddening how many native speakers do n't know the difference between `` there '' , `` their '' and `` they 're '' . 
  many do n't notice that `` should of '' , `` could of '' and `` would of '' do n't make any sense . 
  other frustrating grammar crimes : `` his '' vs `` he 's '' , `` your '' vs. `` you 're '' and so on . 
  all done by an awful lot of native speakers . 
  that 's the new standar ** t ** , 
  the equator runs along the city border between essen and m\u00fchlheim a. d. ruhr . 
   guys this is r/europe can we please discuss this in a civil manner . 
  in r/europe ? 
  unlikely . 
   was marked as a `` gef\u00e4hrder ( roughly translated a treat ) '' in this case an interesting spelling error . 
  gef\u00e4hrder are persons who are likely to * threaten * public safety , of course , 
  forth, 
  abusing children to do the job . 
  sounds different than f\u00fchrer in german , though . 
  and i would guess it 's most likely a form of fuhrmann , which would be carter or wagoner in english . 
   the diaeresis makes for a big difference in meaning . 
  say again ? 
  we 're having some severe atmospheric interference . 
   not ** there ** fault i guess . 
   i wish people knew this . 
  i 've came across many people who confused the two accidentally . 
  do you mean people who -- not accidentally , but regularly -- confuse ** there ** and ** their ** ? 
  a confusion that is even more irritating , 
  thanks for the extra3 contribution . 
  i love them , 
  siemens being corrupt again -- why am i not surprised ? 
  no problem . 
  you were n't the only one who wrote * wave * instead of * waive * . 
  i was tired , too -- and annoyed after reading that for the third or * forth * time . 
   i got some coffee right here ; be my guest , 
  waives . 
  it 's neither about fluids nor the hand gesture , , 
  absolutely . 
  i guess most people associate it with the music , though . 
  damn those dam sites !, 
  dam good , friend !, 
  watch him talk ; he has this peculiar way of distorting his face . 
  while the russians are at it , let them release the full extent of their own domestic corruption and manipulation of elections , too . 
  just to level the playing field . 
  from beethoven 's 9th symphony . 
  the police lawyer 's surname , aas , means carrion/rotting corpse in german . 
  reading the article , his name seemed like a dark and macaber idea a crime writer would have . 
  color scales that are brightness sales at the same time work very well . 
  blue-yellow scales cover most of all color deficiencies . 
  or combine colors with distinct patterns . 
  it 's actually pretty simple . 
  you do n't need a fully fledged spectral color perception simulation for that . 
   photoshop offers a tool and there are also free alternatives . 
  map makers should use color scales tha are readable for both . 
  this is n't magic . 
  close to 10 % of people have a form of color vision deficiency , and this is not a new phenomenon . 
  i 'm surprised how many maps here use terrible color scales . 
  what a condescending and generalizing comment . 
  to be honest , i also had the uk in mind while i wrote that . 
  but it was also aimed at people from the us where this might actually be more likely to happen . 
  if you are willing to pay a fine . 
  depends on the location , i guess . 
  just try to avoid it . 
  you wo n't get registered as sexual offender for taking a leak , if that 's what you 're aiming at . 
  the laws and fines may vary from country to country . 
  there is no `` european law '' about this . 
  rhetorical questions -- are they bad practice for titles of news articles ? 
  german here . 
  i started with latin in 5th grade , then english followed in 7th grade , and french in 9th grade . 
  i do n't remember , but i think the third foreign language was n't mandatory ( 1980 's / 1990 's ) . 
  wrong universe . 
  you mean they are trying to hide these weird anomalies and artifacts . 
  they did n't sacrifice their lives , did they ? 
  according to the iaea only 40 people died because of the chernobyl incident . 
  is n't it awesome how you can distort reality with studies ? 
  i did n't believe my eyes when i downloaded it from the iaea website . 
  poor brave liquidators . 
  soon there wo n't be ( m ) any of them left . 
  they tend to die of natural causes much earlier than the rest of the population . 
  / s it 's a fucking disgrace * that the victims of the catastrophe are n't recognized . 
  * * here we go , 5 people apparently did n't get it . 
  * edit : more words , see part in italics . 
  delusions of grandeur can bite you in the ass , erdo -- and they will , sooner or later . 
  easy : the eu it 's the cheapest solution and the easiest scapegoat . 
  i would n't be surprised if they were inspired by hollywood movies . 
  it looks so ridiculous . 
  this should be in / r/nottheonion, 
  did anyone eise notice that the thumbnail shows the stalker 's daughter , from tarkovsky 's movie ? 
  what private use other than funsies does a policeperson have for an ak47 ? 
  the color coding sucks . 
  maybe postfactual neosurrealism . 
   someone has to help third parties over the threshold . 
  in my eyes , this is nigh impossible in the us . 
  its first past the post system ( in combination with gerrymandering etc. ), 
  always ends with two antagonistic parties that are pretty close in terms of votes , and coalitions are nonexistent . 
  gerhard schr\u00f6der ( aka der gasableser -- gasman ) would like to have a word with you . 
  not at all . 
  primus inter pares often misses the `` pares '' part . 
  how edgy .
