  how old are you ? 
  twelve ? 
  holy shit !, 
  staatsluftfahrzeug ... would sound odd in german , too . 
   it 's always fun to see the similarities between our languages . 
   pakt of warschau warsaw pact, 
  without basic education ? 
  you mean like joschka fischer ? 
  seems to have worked for that stone-throwing taxi driver , so why not for schulz ? 
  our good old gas meter man gerhard schr\u00f6der . 
  the man who called putin a `` crystal clear democrat '' . 
  and even fewer noticed the crappy job at retouching denmark using white rectangles instead of the background color . 
  rather a level 88 idiot . 
  easy : just write buggers or moles instead . 
  it ' so easy to avoid this kind of `` misunderstanding '' . 
  a fault confessed is half redressed . 
  this last step of yoir l\u00e4ne of reasoning has some serious logical flaws . 
  huh ? 
  why would you want to burn these books ? 
  according to one of the nazi top minds back then `` to analyze the jewish mind and to develop strategies against them '' . 
  something along these lines , iirc . 
  what are you still sitting there ? 
  hurry up , drill starts in 3 minutes and you 're still not wearing you uniform !, 
  if no people had died , maybe . 
  yes , they are the classical example . 
  in germany there was a rather big case of a nurse who injected several patients with a drugs to cause cardiac arrest , so he could revive them and be the hero . 
  it 's actually funny how the resentments against refugees , oops economic migrants -- the war was over , so they were all economic migrants , amirite -- were exactly the same 70 years ago as thzy are today . 
  there was a really interesting feature on the radio a few weeks ago , with sound recordings of interviews , where germans were complaining about all those terrible migrants who wo n't be able or willing to integrate into germany 's society . 
  they ate different stuff , did n't know the rules and `` key of living '' in tear villages , wdid not know the glorious german language well enough ... they came up with any argument you know from today 's discussion . 
  the colors should be even less distinguishable . 
  do n't give anyone a chance to recognize the borders between countries . 
  and please , never think about people with color deficiencies . 
  one of several very worldly reasons : scientology was under surveillance by the constitutional protection service for several years , for their anti-constitutional doctrines and teachings . 
  besides , scientology is only a `` religion '' with tax exempt status in the us thanks to their infiltration of the irs . 
  maybe you have never heard about * operation snow white * ? 
  everything 's in english reading  massif central or french ? 
  all ( or most ) names in their own mother tongue would be more along tolkien 's understanding . 
  were n't translated in tolkien 's map of middle earth , either . 
  i would understand lo-pan . 
  but buddha ? 
  germany 's not on the list ? 
  but everyone from t_d says my beloved country is basically germanistan . 
  i am so confused . 
  short answer : no . 
  long answer : fuck , no . 
  i disagree . 
  i found learning german super easy . 
  and i should know because i 'm german . 
  hmm , how about real languages ? 
  it 'll be a hodgepodge of pidgin english dialects . 
  its difficulty depends on your mother language . 
  and i assume you mean irregularities in english ? 
  german has them , too . 
  many languages have irregularities . 
  but english orthography is actually a mess , i 'll give you that . 
   but what 's the etymology of ` duits ' ( in the sense of ` dutch ' ) then ? 
  iirc * thiudisk * , meaning ` of the people ', 
  nothing new . 
  the cold war scare was nice in that respect , too . 
  still going on in the early to mid-eighties . 
  i heard the end of times scare in the late 900 's was quite intense as well . 
  and do n't forget the end times fears of 1999 . 
  we humans seem to be in need of this stupid fear of the end . 
   faz [ ... ] as left as it gets . 
  huh ? 
  yeah , there are x-ray methods to determine at least a pretty precise age bracket , but they get less precise over the age of 15 or so : http://theconversation.com/bone-of-contention-can-wrist-x-rays-really-reveal-the-age-of-people-smugglers-2049, 
  this , kids , is why ** no entity ** on this planet should be allowed to collect and store more personal data than absolutely necessary . 
  well , the handelsblatt reports the same , as do reuters , dw and a lot of other reliable news sources that clearly have no affiliation with mr g\u00fclen or his agenda . 
  you could n't be more wrong . 
  it was a gay conspiracy . 
  ask putin !, 
  the german newspaper handelsblatt is g\u00fclenist ? 
  either you are kidding or you are erdogan himself . 
  he calls everyone he dislikes g\u00fclenist as well . 
  just photoshopping the original characters into `` slav '' surroundings is rather lame . 
  their style of clothing and costumes would look totally different as well . 
  it 's getting more originally mcoriginalface every mceveryface singly mcsingleface daily mcdayface . 
  boring shit . 
  i find some redditors quite ridiculous as well . 
  but that 's how it is . 
  there are always some people with some traits one finds annoying or ridiculous . 
  i 'm not color deficient , but op really must hate deuteranopes and protanopes aka red-green color blind people . 
  the scale is pretty poor overall , even for color normal people , but it 's really crappy for color deficient people . 
  as in the case of `` suicides '' , sex crimes , the laws around these etc. 
  are an interesting case in japan . 
  [ why sex crimes in japan go unreported - tokyo weekender ] ( http://www.tokyoweekender.com/2017/06/sex-crimes-japan-go-unreported/ ) [ discussing sex crimes and japan 's ` safety myth ' - the japan times ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/12/29/voices/discussing-sex-crimes-japans-safety-myth/ ) and they just reformed their over a century old laws concerning sex crimes : [ diet makes historic revision to century-old sex-crime laws - the japan times ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/06/16/national/politics-diplomacy/diet-makes-historic-revision-century-old-sex-crime-laws/ ) a good part of `` low '' sex crime rates in japan was due to what was defined as sex crimes and also short statutes of limitations e.g. 
  for child abuse . 
  i 'm not saying that japanese are bad rapists , the statistics in the image show that that 's not the case , but the reality in japan is actually different from the official numbers , similar to the problem of the high number of `` suicides '' , which apparently , thanks to fudged police reports ( which came out a few years ago in several cases ) and `` misinterpretation '' were often just unsolved deaths or even unsolved murder cases . 
  murder is bad for statistics , so reporting them as suicides was an easy solution . 
  thanks !, 
  much appreciated . 
  nothing against a good d\u00f6ner or lahmacun !, 
  but please without erdogan around . 
  that guy tends to ruin all fun , 
  as soon as they introduce the death penalty all membership perspectives are out of the window anyway . 
  paywall, 
  much more than the village population . 
  as long as the slavs can join their `` rudolf hess , rudolf hess '' chants they should n't have any problems . 
  i do n't know what happened but i seemed to have deleted my answer by accident . 
  at least i ca n't see it anymore .
