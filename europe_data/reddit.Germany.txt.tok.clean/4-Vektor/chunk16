  let the turkish media go rabid about liberal turks in germany . 
  let them . 
  it 's the best and cheapest way to demonstrate to the rest of europe what the turkish administration is actually about . 
   can european people europe \u2260 eu, 
  btw , hermaphrodite is not a term used for humans . 
  intersex is fine . 
  and people with two sets of genitals are almost nonexistent . 
  if at all they have so-called ambiguous genitalia . 
  nope , that 's actually not the case . 
  intersexuality is rather defined by number and type of sex chromosomes , sex hormones , type of gonads , existing internal reproductive system and external genitalia . 
  everyone with characteristics that differ from typically male or female at birth are considered intersex . 
  this means , a lot of intersex people look no different from male or female persons but they have e. g. more sex chromosomes or malformed gonads or external genitalia , like hypospadias . 
  it 's not a surprise . 
  the uk did n't have any need for its own negotiators for 40 years . 
  that job was done by the eu for them . 
  it 's no wonder they are desperately trying to get negotiators from the best sources available . 
  edit : word position , clarification, 
  a lot of people are already too stressed with staying oriented in 2 dimenions . 
  adding one more wo n't make it better . 
  no problem . 
   i know what plural is , you made that comparison in your first post . 
  sure , because op translated base with basen , which is wrong . 
  it 's not visible anymore because op edited his original post before you answered ( `` last edited 3 hours ago '' ) . 
  there is no point in discussing that because nobody can see op 's original post anymore . 
  you only know his edited version . 
  edit : his original translation was something along  alle eure basen sind geh\u00d6rend zu uns, 
  the english original is singular , not plural . 
  just read my comment again . 
  the original is :  all your ** base ** are belong to us if it were plural , then it would be  all your * bases * are belong to us i 'm just translating the original mistake of using a singular noun ( base ) but a plural verb ( are ) to german more precisely , that 's all . 
  and `` belong to us '' simply translates to `` geh\u00f6rt uns '' oder `` geh\u00f6ren uns '' . 
  a web of bilateral agreements that was built via decades of negotiations . 
  let 's not forget the time frame . 
  social democrats on paper , but pretty much the slightly left wing of the cdspd centrist party in practice . 
  honestly , i do n't think that the quality of the trade deal will depend on the `` generosity '' of the settlement . 
  the negotiations of trade deals and all the other hundreds of matters will be handled independently from the settlement concerning the outstanding financial obligations of the uk . 
  and i doubt that paying a few billions more will change anything about the stance of eu negotiators . 
  they 're professionals ( and hopefully the british negotiators as well ) , not some crappy underlings of a ~ ~ b ~ ~ banana republic whom you can easily buy with a little bribe . 
  a few billions do n't make a big difference in the * long term * perspective of international trade , which i would assume is the main focus of the eu side of negotiations . 
  all the shouting and name calling is a thing politicians may do , but not a large group of professional negotiators with decades of international trade deal negotiation knowledge and experience up their sleeves . 
  alle ihre basis sind geh\u00d6ren uns it 's * all your base are belong to us * , not * all your bases are belonging to us * . 
   instant reply !, 
  thank you . 
  ftfy, 
  we 'll see what the uk owes the eu . 
  it 'll surely be a little more than $ 0 -- even if you , from your expert eu negotiation standpoint , disagree . 
  those times when you roll your eyes so hard that you can see your own brain . 
   ... where everyone contributed to the fund to feed the restaurant , according to funds ** everyone ** agreed upon . 
  ftfy, 
  oh , anon has spoken ? 
  that 's a first on 4chan . 
  no worries , german companies do the same . 
  you 're not alone with that . 
  the hypocrisy about that is quite something , eh ? 
  your tl ; dr is longer than 99 % of all regular comments on reddit ; i like that . 
  everything pales in comparison to the bank bailout , and even that did n't ruin germany financially . 
  besides , how about the integration of east germany that cost about 1.6 ? 
  * trillion * since 1990 ? 
  we have had much costlier integration projects , as you can see .

  too bad piratebay tid n't exist back then . 
  but a little later dc was a pretty neat service . 
  and it probably still is . 
  i have n't used it for ages , but i guess it 's still alive . 
  still orders of magnitude cheaper than bailng out banks or integrating 16 million former members of a dictatorial police state . 
  i think 100 million euros is pretty much pocket money nowadays . 
  you mean , like `` deus vult '' ? 
  there 's a mechanism called enlightenment . 
  it was quite successful over time . 
  islam is pretty late to this enlightenment party , though , i got to admit that . 
  oh , it 's definitely more affordable . 
  and louder . 
  there are a few videos that show wdl round flights from essen-m\u00fchlheim , and the motors are n't exactly silent  but i would love to go on one of these flights someday . 
  they fly over my house pretty much everyday during the summer , and dammit , i want to see my house from above looking out of the cabin of this blimp at least once . 
  exactly !, 
  it 's the typical putin show that 's actually directed at his own country . 
  really old and really successful in terms of internal politics . 
  you got ta keep your comrades in great mother russia in line , and this kind of rhetoric is perfect for that . 
  and there is the [ old catholic church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_catholic_church ) that separated from the rest after the first vatican council because of certain doctrines they did n't agree to , like the papal authority , papal infallibility etc. 
  yeah , the price made me hesitate . 
  there 's the opportunity to go on [ blimp tours at the essen-m\u00fchlheim airfield ( edle ) ] ( http://www.flughafen-essen-muelheim.com/cms/index.php ) , pretty much next door to me . 
  [ $ 310 for adults , $ 195 for kids ] ( http://www.wdl-worldwide.com/index.php/das-luftschiff#rundflug ) . 
  a bit much for my taste . 
  did you actually watch the whole sketch ? 
  did you miss the punchline ? 
  the rationale ? 
  as old as history itself : divide et impera . 
  what could ever go wrong with that choice ? 
  negotiations are n't fun if there 's no cunt around to fuck them up . 
  and farage is a quality cunt , second to none . 
  too controversial . 
  another fun fact : switzerland was one of the largest contributors in the nuclear waste disposal in the atlantic ocean . 
  everything makes a lot more sense now , 
  interesting , i had no problem to understand that you meant it metaphorically . 
  maybe some people try too hard to misunderstand things . 
  they are misleading 50 % of the time everytime . 
  as someone who knows the scenes of book burnings by the nazis and who has read bradbury 's fahrenheit 451 , i always feel very uneasy about book burnings , no matter what book it is . 
  nice !, 
  i like that . 
  completely , defending , passes , cultural , reference , text , comments ... all latin words . 
  those who say latin is useless did n't learn a second language that 's either romance or english ,
