  facebook is just second hand tabloid content provided by tabloid readers or first hand amateur `` content providers '' aka facebook users . 
  honestly , tabloids are the prime source of information for a considerable amount of people . 
  which is depressing . 
  the legendary subtle british humor . 
  damn , these look like satire , not like actual newspapers . 
  i thought britain was rabies-free . 
  i guess i 'm wrong . 
  even trump himself is a tool . 
  bavaria 's whining is getting old . 
  they seem to have forgotten that they were n't net contributors right from the start . 
  ceterum censeo ... nice try , kid . 
  we 're smart , too . 
  and we already learned about this trick when your parents were n't even a glint in your grandparent 's eyes . 
  not to forget that only hours later there were lists with thousands of names of people who were to be arrested . 
  but nothing 's foul about that , right ? . 
  europe does not have a single culture . 
  are you sure you know the meaning of self-esteem ? 
  colon cancer ? 
  maybe that 's why he 's so full of shit . 
  thus we call them sinti und roma instead nowadays . 
  like so many other of these infections , chickenpox is potentially fatal . 
  a lot of these `` harmless '' illnesses can lead either to death or lifelong ( sometimes crippling ) negative consequences . 
  apart from that , the economic harm of large parts of the population that are either ill or infect others , is not minor , either . 
  edit : in germany , a mother of three just recently died of the complications of her measles infection . 
  this is actually the proper english counterpart . 
  the other one is just a literal translation . 
  german ** not ** ( pronounced with a long o ) has several meanings , often depending on the compound it is part of , like misery , necessity ( as in notdurft ) or emergency ( as in notruf , notschlachtung ) . 
  ** not ** is a cognate of english ** need ** and ** needs ** . 
  it 's funny how adaptive german industries can be if they are forced by law . 
  and the expertise can even be the birth of a lucrative new industrial branch . 
  the car industry is the next one who needs to feel some pressure . 
  obstacles can be good for progress , it seems . 
  all that pathetic and theatrical whining of the big industry should be ignored by default .

  thank goodness we do n't use legal terms for these coalition names . 
  imagine the * ampelkoalition * would officially be named ** lichtsignalanlagenkoalition ** instead . 
  i hope i 'm not giving anyone ideas . 
  you never know in germany , 
  thanks , our friendly dutch neighbors . 
  this erdogan circus taking place outside of turkey really needs to end . 
  at least they wo n't need another referendum about joining the eu , then . 
  that 's out of the window if they have the death penalty . 
  a lot of these countries are muslim , too . 
  africa is not just a catholic bloc . 
  muslim slave trade took place in ... yep , africa . 
  and islam spread to africa already in the 7th century . 
  about 50 % of the african population is muslim , so i do n't know what you are trying to tell us , exactly . 
  chicken for africa ? 
  they already get so much chicken from europe that their local production died . 
  what a bad idea . 
   which means men act more aggressively in situatios ? 
  say , testosterone ? 
  interesting . 
  i remember a study from 20 years ago or so where women with higher testosterone levels acted more cooperatively on average . 
  testosterone = aggressive behavior is an intriguing but a rather simplistic formula . 
  how cute , coming from that woman . 
  she knows a thing or two about threats , eh ? 
  i 'm all for trying to push for advantages of one 's own industries , but fuck my country . 
  the power of certain industrial lobbies in germany is way too big . 
  our car industry better advance technologically instead of relying on protectionism because they missed important trends and developments during the last 20 years . 
  which is kind of funny because the arrested person alledgedly was an ex-policeman who worked in security for one of the big swiss banks while at the same time working as a `` freelance '' spy for the ndb to find out who acquired the tax cds : [ schweizer wegen spionage gegen steuerfahnder verhaftet ( dw article ) ] ( http://p.dw.com/p/2c9f5 ), 
   you 're incredibly bias . 
  biased . 
  i 'm certain he 's a human . 
  his whole book was a one-trick pony along these lines . 
  a repetitive , boring , mind-numbingly dumb and hateful chore . 
  it 's always refreshing to see that throughout history greed always was stronger than `` patriotism '' . 
  maybe not always for the little patrioric citizens on their little scale , but if it 's about business and money , you always know what you can put your bet on . 
  and i thought that shit `` which ... are you ? '', 
  spam was only taking place on facebook . 
  looks suspiciously dutch to me . 
  hello , neighbor !, 
  no sense of irony or humor ... spotted the german !, 
  actually the word you mean is ** emigrant ** . 
  basically , it 's a more ** patri ** otic sounding version of ** emigrant ** , which awakes in some circles unwanted associations with brown people aka ** immigrants ** . 
   patria is the latin word for `` ~ ~ home country ~ ~ fatherland '' ftfy, 
  true !, 
  humor on r/europe can be a dangerous thing , 
  sorry , apparently irony is n't always recognizeable . 
  i thought the prior statement made it obvious enough . 
  yeah , all these men with memory loss and words of honor back then . 
  one of them even ended up dead in a bathtub ( unrelated to the 100,000 dm ) . 
  we ~ ~ n ~ ~ had lots of honorable men back then . 
  edit : to prevent further misunderstandings please imagine an ** / s ** tag behind my last statement . 
  i forgot that this subreddit is n't r/uk . 
  i speak latin . 
  can confirm . 
  in german it 's only one compound noun , of course : hurensohn what else could it be ? 
  at least that word is n't too long this time . 
  i explained that explicitely . 
  voter turnout was 50 % . 
   i went to * collage * in the us  the only ones that know how to speak english are * old 60 's * migrants . 
  i take it you 're younger than 60 ? 
  it 's a mix of a lot of things . 
  `` strong leaders '' are very fashionable at the moment , feelings of social inferiority , protest voting , resentment of `` liberal pussies '' in mainly secular countries like e.g. 
  germany and the netherlands , misdirected and irrational fantasies about a `` home country '' that most of them have never actually lived in or where they would n't be accepted as citzens because they 're `` germanlanders '' ( * deutschl\u00e4nder * , i do n't remember the turkish word ) ... it 's a hodgepodge of so many things , and a lot of these ( not all of them ) things are quite irrational . 
  and we should n't forget the plain rejection of the secular culture by a considerable amount of these voters ( and other groups that are getting more radicalized ) . 
  but , to get a less distorted idea , it 's maybe necessary to consider that the voter turnout was only roughly 50 % in germany , in comparison to the e.g. 
  80 % turnout in turkey . 
  that still means that ** at least 33 % of all ** eligible voters in my city and ** around 25 % of all eligible voters in germany ** voted for erdogan , which is terrible enough .
