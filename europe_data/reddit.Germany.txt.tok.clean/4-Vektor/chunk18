  i do n't know what it is with so many people longing for `` strong leaders '' at the moment , which is such an undemocratic craving in my eyes . 
  especially combined with accepting the implied distortion of balance of powers in favor of the executive branch . 
  the willingness to reduce the power of the judicial and legislative branches that are supposed to keep the executive in check , is beyond me . 
  edit : missing words, 
  because [ that 's what a hegemon does ] ( https://youtu.be/nfjnfsyfmzs?t=760 ) . 
  watch the whole video , it 's worth it . 
  chalmer 's books are very helpful in understanding the workings of american imperialism , too . 
  it 's got nothing to do with historical `` kitsch '' . 
  it 's about mere power projection . 
  with historical roots , of course . 
  but kitsch has nothing to do with it . 
  forever war was always a good mode of operation for the us . 
  why should n't forever state of emergency work well for turkey ? 
  well , the mechanism is n't really new . 
  * pretty much half of the uk was against leaving the eu . 
  * * pretty much half of the us did n't vote for trump . 
  * just think about how these realities are handled by the respective people and news media . 
  should be a pretty familiar setting . 
  you know , what 's even more frustrating ? 
  ** in my city in germany 75 % of the turkish referendum votes were `` yes '' ** . 
  i just ca n't fucking believe it . 
  just as an example , there are millions over millions of legal guns in germany already . 
  there is no need to change gun laws at all . 
  why ? 
  how come that you ca n't type vocals when you write koran and muslims ? 
  nah , as we all know , indonesia is the other great example of a muslim democracy , almost a role model for the rest of the world , although i have n't heard anyone mention it anymore in a while . 
  i 'm wondering why ...  my favorite erdo quote :  democracy is like a train : when you reach your destination , you get off . 
  another sweet quote from about the same time when he was mayor of istanbul ( [ youtube link to the video here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg3hkwcna8c ) )  `` you can not be both secular and a muslim !, 
  you will either be a muslim , or secular !, 
  when both are together , they create reverse magnetism [ i.e.they repel one another ] . 
  for them to exist together is not a possibility !, 
  therefore , it is not possible for a person who says `` i am a muslim '' to go on and say `` i am secular , too . '', 
  and why is that ? 
  because allah , the creator of the muslim , has absolute power and rule ! '', 
  he never made a secret of his true nature . 
  the 3 % mean a loss of around 25 % in relative terms . 
  losing almost a quarter of your supporters is quite a plunge . 
   football ultra culture no , they are violent thugs , not cultural ambassadors . 
  the british might not be aware of the fact that expat means * outside the fatherland * , but in the end they just say fatherland in latin . 
  too late . 
  world says trump is still an idiot . 
  oh , all five eyes countries are european now ? 
  in european terms sanders is a centrist . 
  there is no left in the us . 
  kerning is a very important aspect of typography : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kerning that 's why it 's also jokingly called keming on this r/keming subreddit . 
  bad kerning making `` rn '' look like `` m '' because they are too close together . 
  bad or nonexistent kerning in proportional fonts looks terrible and unprofessional . 
  [ this classic xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1015/ ) on kerning should make sense once you have an idea what kerning is about , 
  only use brute force if sanctioned by your caliph . 
  oh , and i hoped it was clear that this was n't a real quote . 
  i was just alluding to his statement that belgium was a nice city . 
  just to demonstrate his amazing wisdom and knowledge about the world . 
  the fact that he supports brexit is quite irrelevant . 
  tomorrow he 'll be against it if it helps him or if he had hard stool in the morning . 
  hahahaha, 
  haha , i 'm relieved that you were not serious about that . 
  it 's crazy how quickly things are going downhill at the moment in turkey . 
  i miss the spirit of optimism and the times when important things got actually done in turkey . 
  i hope this is just a short intermission and some sensible politician puts politics back on track again , for the sake of the turkish people . 
  `` britain is a lovely city '' -- donald trump, 
  i 'm not sure if you are mentioning the airport thing in an ironic way or not . 
  the lufthansa involvement in the gezi protests about the airport is just blatantly obvious conspiracy nonsense . 
  we had a good laught at that one in germany . 
  at some point it felt like every single protest in turkey was blamed on the germans or some german secret conspiracy or stuff like that . 
  yeah , e.g. 
  ditib gets way too much credit for what it 's actually worth . 
  they ** claim ** to speak for the majority of turks in germany , get support from turkey , are `` surprisingly '' silent about the radicalization of parts of the muslim community in germany , but actually the alevi and other majorities in germany are not even part of that organization . 
  and they do n't speak for the secular turks in germany at all , of course . 
  it 's a farce . 
  i 'm using `` turks '' instead of `` germans with turkish roots '' for the most part , just because it 's shorter . 
  blame it on my laziness . 
  as i said , i 'm aware of that . 
  the whole theatralic performance is mainly for his own people . 
  it 's just so bizarre from an outside standpoint . 
  and i guess also bizarre for a lot of turks living in turkey . 
  nevertheless , germany is n't really irrelevant , as erdogan has a strong influence on a not so small minority of the non-secular turks in germany . 
  and turkey has a strong influence on the muslim associations in germany ... the associations that speak only for a small part of the turks in germany , but are quite vocal nonetheless . 
  i 'm well aware of that . 
  i mean , there is n't much he could come up with we have n't dealt with in looking at and dealing with our own violent history before . 
  he 's unable to deal with the history of his own country , that 's the big difference . 
  the bundestag vote was not only about the osman empire but also about the part the germans played in the whole story . 
  it 's no secret in germany that we had our own part in several genocides . 
  it 's no secret in germany that the germans were allies of turkey when that armenian thing happened . 
  neither is the genocide of the herero and nama a secret in germany . 
  bring it on , erdogan !, 
  we can take it . 
  let him . 
  he 'll have a hard time beating our own museums and memorials . 
  what a buffoon . 
  send that poor man a goat , for goodness ' sake ... he 's feeling alone . 
  ... because mr. kellogg thought it would keep boys from masturbating . 
  at least they do n't destroy clitorises with carbolic acid for the same reason in the us nowadays , like mr. kellogg suggested . 
  `` do you want your daughter 's clit get burned away with acid ? '' `` i guess so , i want her clit to look like mine . '' man , apart from corn flakes , mr. kellogg spent a lot of time thinking about masturbation of boys and girls , and about enemas . 
  what 's wrong with horse steaks ? 
  if it 's good for a yummy sauerbraten , it ca n't be bad for a steak , right ? 
  `` jeez , calm down with your paedophilia britain . '' -- marc dutroux sorry , i noticed the flag and could n't resist . 
  the self-censorship of newspapers was worse in the past . 
  everytime they did n't mention the city or district a person lived or came from , you knew it was an article about one of these lebanese clan fights again . 
  if it was a local who was n't muslim/lebanese or whatever , they they would write `` the 37 year old man from cologne ( k\u00f6lner ) ... '' i 'm glad that this kind of obvious self-censorship has stopped in most cases now . 
  this kind of racism by omission of information was just weird and ridiculous .
