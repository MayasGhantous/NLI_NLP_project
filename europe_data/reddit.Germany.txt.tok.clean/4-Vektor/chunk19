  it stopped when the lebanese clans and their illegal actions were reported in documentaries and news broadcasts more often . 
  humans are pattern recognition machines . 
  sometimes we see patterns although there are n't any . 
  most of the time we see patterns that are actual patterns , though . 
  i think you 're fine in this case . 
  it 's good that german and dutch are similar . 
  it even rhymes in german , haha . 
  ovomaltine, 
  harald welzer 's book `` t\u00e4ter '' about the massacers by the police batallion 45 is a good read about how ordinary people convinced themselves of doing nothing wrong and commiting terrible crimes . 
  and interestingly , those who did n't want to participate in the mass shootings e.g. 
  in the sobibor extermination camp , did n't have to , and they had to face no negative consequences . 
  no , no . 
  then base the discussion on their age . 
  there 's no need to bring in some whataboutism into this . 
  the topic is : * old ss farts getting prosecuted * , not * but what about them old jews ? 
  you called it a troll account yourself , and `` controversial issues '' is an interesting way to put statements like your admiration for the 3rd reich , and ( at least borderline ) denial of parts of the holocaust . 
  there is nothing smart or controversial about that . 
  and yes , it is hijacking , because you are switching the focus of the actual focus of the topic , which is the prosecution of a former ss guard of a concentration camp . 
  do n't try to hijack this thread to make it about prosecuting jews for some twisted sense of `` justice '' . 
  it 's not about jews or jewish collaborators , it 's about reinhold hanning . 
  i know you 're using a trolling account of sorts , but please do n't do that . 
  yeah , there is a nice german word for these kinds of `` clerks '' : schreibtischt\u00e4ter you really try hard to make these guys appear almost as innocent bystanders , i do n't understand why . 
  none of those who got prosecuted were dragged into this by force majeure , no matter how you try to spin the story . 
  neither reinhold hanning and none of the last people who were prosecuted for these crimes were mere clerks . 
  you really had to be convinced of a lot more than just german superiority to join the ss . 
  i see no problem in the prosecution of former concentration camp staff . 
  and that 's what this article is about . 
  it 's not about jews or other people who helped the nazis . 
  we all know that in a lot of places ordinary people , and not only germans , participated in all kinds of cruel activities , but i think it 's absolutely fine to prosecute at least the last remaining ss members or other death camp staff before they all are going to be dead in the next 10 to 15 years . 
  germany was reluctant enough ( both , with or without help of the allies/esp . 
  the us ) to prosecute promiment perpetrators of the nazi regime . 
  finally there is more enthusiasm from the official side to bring at least some sense of closure to this . 
  better late than never . 
  edit : and these ss guys actively made times quite `` difficult '' for a lot of other people , so it 's not like they were just helpless bystanders who got involved by mere coincidence . 
  the ss was not a group of people trying to save their skin . 
  or they would n't attack because they were the source . 
  it 's sad that it has to be mentioned that german laws apply to everyone in germany . 
  my goodness . 
  it 's the 21st century . 
  they have an observatory , doing actual scientific work , and yet -- they display such superstitious foolishness . 
  grow up , francis !, 
   ~ ~ fuck ~ ~ well done !, 
  ~ ~ ir ~ ~ regardless , 
  i agree with schrems ; that could get really interesting -- if the right questions get asked . 
  actor has opinion on something ... that 's something new . 
  not sure if joking or just ignorant ... edit : seriously , your understanding of that part of history is almost comical . 
  just fyi , there was a `` braunbuch '' ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/braunbuch#cite_note-1 ) , you can [ read it here ] ( https://archive.org/details/braunbuchbrd ) , containing info about a lot of former nazi officials who were still in official duty in west germany after the war . 
  and just to make it clear , there also was a `` braunbuch ddr '' written by olaf kappelt , about former nazis in the gdr . 
  sorry , no matter what the gdr 's official goodspeak was , it was n't the magical nazi free zone of happiness . 
  here 's a bit more : [ die nationale front , neonazis in der ddr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viw_w4js0kq ) [ rechtsradikale in der ddr , from 1990 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdgpe6sltm0 ) [ das erbe der nazis , die ddr : anspruch und wirklichkeit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csbfzhgwzwa ), 
  yeah , and magically there were no former nazis in east germany , by definition and decree of the party . 
  / s that 's why we nowadays have `` national befreite zonen '' ( nationally liberated zones , where neo-nazis pretty much took over ) in the former gdr . 
  / s they were everywhere , not only in the west . 
  that 's why they like to chant `` usa , usa , usa !!, 
  turkey will soon be the proudest country on earth . 
  proud about everything turkish because everything was invented in turkey !, 
  all hail our turkish overlord recep tayyip erdo\u011fan !, 
  billions of others speak and read more or less forms of pidgin english , which is n't really from england , 
  because they are proud of three languages at once ? 
  sorry you did n't notice that my comment was n't serious . 
  i thought the **  ** was good enough to hint at that ... 
  i was rather alluding to the hilarious obsession of the gdr leadership with `` proper '' terminology . 
  it 's obvious that the terminology itself is just stupid , because they clearly were n't a democracy , even if they called themselves that . 
  i still remember honecker on tv , trying to say `` deutsche demokratische republiiiiik '' ... he was comical at best . 
  the consequences of his ( and his horrible wife 's ) policies were n't that funny , though . 
  it ca n't have been that much fun if people wanted to tear the wall down , and thankfully , managed to do that peacefully . 
  i remember how bizarre and unreal it felt at first , seeing on tv how the people crossed over in ' 89 , climbed up the wall , broke parts out of it with hammers . 
  yes , i 'm afraid she will . 
  she never does anything that could be interpreted as her own opinion . 
  god forbid she would lose potential voters by taking sides every once in a while . 
  she 's always on her own side , i guess . 
  make it thousands . 
  reminds me of the stuff you can see in old tv snippets from the 60 's : `` nicht alles was hitler gemacht hat war schlecht . '' it 'll take a bit longer for both `` sides '' to grow together , but that 's not really surprising . 
  denial is one phase , acceptance will come later  edit : grammar, 
  oh , you got it completely wrong . 
  it was ** real existierender sozialismus ** ( real socialism ) , not communism . 
  that 's something completely different , 
  yes , and a lot of people are n't aware that there were countries not too far away that did n't exist yet or do n't exist anymore . 
  and nobody predicted any of this . 
  that 's why i always think `` how cute '' when people `` predict '' what the world is going to look like in 50 years . 
  these segments are rather poking fun at the stereotypes germans have about the brits than poking fun at the brits themselves . 
  a lot of people do n't seem to notice that . 
  or i 'm just weird for seeing it this way . 
  or just watch ard and zdf , avoid private tv like the plague . 
  this way you may be able to avoid the worst stereotypes . 
  yep , nrw was right in the british sector . 
  my granddad used to help out as an interpreter for the scots after the war ended . 
  he was around 18 years old at that time . 
  he always said to me they were the nicest guys . 
  personally , i never met any british soldier in germany . 
  i only met quite a few british exchange students at uni , and they were pretty normal , as one would expect . 
  a bit prone to drinking a lot , but nice lads and lasses . 
  the chinese , however ... , 
  wladimir kaminer , maybe . 
  but i guess he does n't count  also , vladimir putin has a lot of comedic talent , almost on par with erodgan . 
  to be honest , you do n't need to be an expert to know that parts of the community with turkish roots will disagree . 
  you only need to live in any major german city . 
  let them disagree . 
  that 's a good exercise in accepting the democratic majority . 
  they need more exercises like this .
