  it 's not part of the military . 
  ah yes , beagle !, 
  and mars climate orbiter tried to play mars climate lander instead thanks to the nasa failure i mentioned above , 
  first `` we '' lost . 
  the other one was nasa 's imperial units fuck-up , was n't it ? 
  edit : i stand corrected . 
  the 2nd we lost . 
  ~ ~ number 3 , the one nasa managed to destroy , was the mars climate orbiter . ~ ~ i had in my mind that the mco mission was a nasa-esa cooperation , but it was actually a nasa-jpl cooperation . 
  jpl messed up the units and used imperial instead of metric/si . 
   however , on september 23 , 1999 , communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion , due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-si units of pound-seconds ( lbf s ) instead of the si units of newton-seconds ( n s ) specified in the contract between nasa and lockheed . 
  so edgy . 
  you forgot this is / r/europe stupid shit comments are mandatory . 
  here , kids learn how to talk tough out of their asses . 
  which other germanic language has more inconsistent spelling than english ? 
  i 'm glad you got this out of your system . 
  there 's a lot of suppressed anger in you , it 's good to talk about it . 
  care to elaborate about our abysmal engineering ? 
  i feel you need to let off more steam , so let it out . 
  the engineering stereotype is not about one region of germany , and it 's at least partly based on facts . 
  source : i was a mechanical engineering student . 
  their economy makes them nazi ? 
  maybe yours just sucks . 
  you 're a funny person for sure . 
  only if they have enough `` holz vor der h\u00fctt \u2019n '' . 
  oh , i did n't only have homophobes in mind . 
  i was thinking of a broader sense of tolerance . 
  dutch are thought to be tolerant about pretty much everything , including same sex relationships , world views etc. 
  mkay . 
  some germans do n't have any humor , it seems . 
  how ironic in this thread . 
  i just gave examples of better alternatives to a stale tourist attraction . 
  i hope i 'm allowed to express my taste . 
  if you think this is just to make you feel inferior , the problem might not be me . 
  even [ burg eltz ] ( http://raredelights.com/massive-majestic-eltz-castle-germany/ ) looks more majestic . 
  neuschwanstein is just boring and fake . 
  there are [ so many beautiful and authentic castles in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_castles_in_germany ) that most tourists unfortunately never see or hear about . 
  yes , i hate that stereotype , too . 
  it 's actually *** w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk !, 
  fakelaki , anyone ? 
  can confirm !, 
  i was in the highlands 24 years ago , and i was lucky to experience both sunny days that year . 
  i even got a nice sunburn the first day . 
  the second day was during the highland games . 
  the remaining 8 days were a rainy and swampy mess . 
  tables with self reported lengths that you found on the web do n't count , 
  do n't worry . 
  homophobic and xenophobic cunts are rather fashionable in europe at the moment . 
  geert wilders was just one of the first and more prominent ones , at least of the `` new generation '' after cunts like le pen etc. 
  you are not alone . 
   do n't judge yourself too harshly . 
  you guys are not so bad . 
  : ca n't live without cheese , either . 
  yeah , the stealing jokes died down once the polish had stolen all opel mantas . 
  that was also the time when the last manta joke was told . 
  nice try , elf !, 
  horst !, 
  my name is horst , count dracula !, 
  your treason will be reported to dr. doom . 
  it 's kitsch ^ 10 there are other places in bavaria that are much more interesting . 
  technically bavarians could be called romans . 
  why stop at the younger history ? 
  or just choose any tribe that crossed today 's german territory during the migration period  by that standard i would be called a frank or saxon , i guess , even if my ancestors maybe were vandals , who knows ... 
  prussia does n't exist anymore , so it 's technically just something bavarians need to distinguish themselves from non-bavarians  edit : word, 
  last time i checked there was no federal state of prussia in germany . 
   if your flavor were n't french i would assume you were bavarian . 
  i 've never heard about that stereotype . 
  maybe you were told this by a korean person who was all too easily impressed . 
  i 'm german . 
  the vast majority of germans is n't bavarian , so fuck off with your neuschwanstein , lederhosen and oktoberfest clich\u00e9s . 
  and no , hitler is n't our president anymore . 
  he lost the 2013 elections against angela merkel . 
  we germans were tired of goosestepping all day . 
  you gave away what was n't yours in the first place ? 
  man , you really need to think before you talk , erdo . 
  it 's funny how this kind of people alwyas clings to some `` wrongdoing '' against `` them '' in the far away past . 
  the farther in the past , the better . 
  let me grab my * morgenstern * before we continue our discussion . 
  we do n't have chiefs and chiefdoms anymore in germany . 
  thanks . 
  i was so confused about his cocksure reaction . 
  did you just assume my naval orientation ? 
  never heard about straights in a naval context . 
  but straits are narrow waterways by definition . 
  that 's why i was wondering . 
  i guess i learned something new , then ? 
  google 's news `` aggregation '' means they make money by stealing the work of others . 
  facebook is in the same boat . 
  ordinary people have to care about stuff like copyright whereas huge companies just say `` nah , idgaf , the laws are for peasants '' ... we live in interesting times . 
  supercruise is the ability of flying at supersonic speeds ** without ** reheat . 
  if reheat is on , then , by definition , it 's not supercruise . 
  for all non-americans : 18 billion ( 18 * 10 ^ 9 ) tons . 
  or tons , if it 's about weight . 
  quite useful in the context of the article , because 1 m ^ 3 of water weighs 1 t. 1 metric ton , obviously . 
  pounds ? 
  seriously ? 
  why not stone , which is the international standard for everything that 's heavier than the average fat kid ? 
  in the beginning , organization was pretty bad and salafists posing as `` language teachers '' abused the system to get their hands on people . 
  by the way , you do n't need to own a gmbh to run language classes . 
  [ from two weeks ago ] ( http://waz.m.derwesten.de/dw/staedte/essen/deutlich-mehr-salafisten-hinweise-in-essen-id12174009.html?service=mobile ) [ from about a year ago ] ( http://m.radiobremen.de/politik/dossiers/fluechtlinge/salafisten-fluechtlinge100.html ) , mentioning that a lot of reports about radical islamist who try to recruit in refugee facilities come from the syrians themselves . 
  you can find lots of articles about this problem with islamists trying to infiltrate the refugee facilities , posing as security personnel , interpreters , etc.
