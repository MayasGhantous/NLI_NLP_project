  and you can also find in these articles that a lot of them are spotted and reported to the authorities by the refugees themselves . 
  also do n't forget that not all syrians are muslims but also christians , druze , yazidis , alawites ( like president al-assad himself ) and mandeans . 
  and with total surveillance ~ ~ of all muslims ~ ~ , maybe we can catch them all . 
  fixed for you , courtesy of all current intelligence agencies that matter . 
  at least that 's how they spin the story . 
  a metric that 's already applied by the nsa , gchq , bnd , etc. 
  most people on this planet are already under more or less total surveillance because of this reasoning . 
  and it 's not the first time that refugees complained to the authorities about salafists trying to recruit members by using e.g. 
  german language courses as camouflage . 
  non-christian germanic names : heinrich , heinz ( meaning `` home ruler '' ) wilhelm or willi ( meaning `` warrior with helmet '' ) oskar , most probably derived from old norse \u00c1sgeirr pagan latin names : max ( imilian ) from `` maximus '' julia/julius some biblical names are rather fashionable at the moment among hipster parents , like noah ; foreign ( preferrably anglicised ) forms of unpagan names as well , like luca ( instead of german lukas ) , john ( instead of johannes ) ... it 's a chaotic mix at the moment , with the trend of older names coming back , like maximilian , johannes etc. 
  nice word play . 
   barbara is actually a roman/latin ( non-barbaric ) name meaning `` foreign woman '' . 
  and st. barbara is the patron saint of miners , armourers etc. 
  so , it is n't even a pagan name anymore . 
  britain vetoing ... now , that 's news . 
  the geography is pretty much similar to europe , and tolkien himself linked anglo-saxon mythology with middle-earth in the book of lost tales . 
  `` [ \u00c6lfwine of england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%86lfwine_of_england ) '' links our world with elements of middle earth , like l\u00fathien . 
  where and when , darling ? 
  no worries . 
  the [ sicher ** heit ** spolizei ( sipo ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicherheitspolizei ) existed in the dark days as an agency of the ss , but that 's certainly not what you had in mind , 
  do n't trust the `` german '' you might hear in us tv shows . 
  it 's usually terribly wrong , 
  do you mean your spelling ? 
  100 mbps , free wi-fi ... i 'm laughing tears . 
  your rite they 're is no problem . 
  i 'm aware of that . 
  it 's still a sign of how bad journalism is getting . 
  if you do n't know the difference between * there * , * their * , and * they 're * , or * you 're * and * your * , then you better do n't have a job as a writer . 
  no , it 's not weird . 
  i 'm criticising the shitty quality of their journalism . 
  if they do n't even pay attention to the basics of their trade , what does that tell of the likely quality of their content ? 
   [ ... ] his raging attackers then aimed there weapons [ ... ] wow , brilliant proof reading . 
  this is n't a simple spelling error ; one needs to have no grasp of language at all to make this `` mistake '' . 
  does the mirror employ lobotomized monkeys as writers ? 
  i 've been following the gaia mission since its beginning . 
  apart from a few already quite interesting bits of information we still got ta wait for the really awesome results that will come after the mission is completed and the data can be evaluated . 
  wait till the first policewoman gets strangled with her own headscarf . 
  i see it coming . 
  barbarian just means foreign , which is not the same as pagan , which means heathen . 
  just saying . 
  you could have none-heathen forgeign names and the other way around . 
  wrong sub . 
  this belongs to / r/nottheonion , 
  [ here you are . 
  ] ( http://papersplea.se ) thank me later ; ), 
  this should be on / r/nottheonion . 
  of course it deserves prosecution . 
  she 's not a special snowflake . 
  she 's a fucking adult who tried to harm another person . 
  she 's a camerawoman working in the field of journalism . 
  she should get reprimanded by the proper jounalist association for her unprofessional behavior , on top of the standard prosecution she has to face . 
  if i harm someone i got ta take the consequences . 
  she ruined her career all by herself . 
  nobody else did that . 
  i do n't understand how you get downvoted . 
  human rights apply to everyone , and nobody 's going to get a free pass on prosecution just because they harmed `` only '' a refugee . 
  what she did is morally even worse because she was a journalist/camerawoman whose job is reporting , not taking `` sides '' or tripping strangers for shits and giggles . 
  edit : ah , sometimes i forget how it goes on / r/europe . 
  sorry for saying that human rights are for everyone , not just for some asshole european camerawoman . 
  i do n't understand how you get downvoted .

  in africa there are kids still starving and yet , you waste time on reddit instead of saving them . 
  see , how this line of argument does n't work ? 
  have you just learned about the history of colonialism or do you have another reason to make this tax evasion thread about colonialism and the general evil in this world ? 
  edit : typo, 
  because it 's not the damned job of the eu . 
  the eu is not a country . 
  it 's really odd that you created an account just to bring up that point about colonialism in the context of tax evasion . 
  i mean , really odd . 
  spoken like a true company exec , 
  yes , before we start doing anything else the native americans should get their country back . 
  / s you know , one thing does n't exclude the other . 
  nobody said that muslims are n't charitable . 
  the point you were making was that nuns are pretty much separated from society , while the majority of them is n't . 
  their charitable work etc. 
  disproves that . 
  on the other hand , to be honest , organizations like ditib or mili g\u00f6rus are not really about charity but rather about islamist propaganda and subversion of democratic structures in other countries ( e.g. 
  germany ) . 
  not to forget about their antisemitism . 
  you know , there is `` charity '' and there is charity . 
  except e.g. 
  for their social and charitable work , right ? 
  i hope you are aware there are an awful lot of very different orders . 
  exactly . 
  the dress code varies a lot between orders . 
  some even wear ordinary clothes like everyone else . 
   i do n't see how christian nuns are integrated , they literally remove themselves from the society . 
  not at all . 
  these orders are rather the exception . 
  most do a lot of social and charitable work . 
  some orders do n't even impose restrictions on their nun 's clothes ( of course they wo n't run around dressed up like street workers ) , so you would n't even notice them if they stood right next to you . 
  maybe you just missed the **  ** at the end of my sentence . 
  the question is , where is the extremism or the parody thereof ? 
  yeah , it only took you over a decade to be fully proficient in it , 
  latin is an awesome language to learn about learning grammar , structure ... because it 's so systematic . 
  and it helped me a lot in learning english and french . 
  it 's a good basis for all romance languages , and a huge part of english vocabulary is basically latin as well . 
  except that by learning germanh you can consume cultural material at its source . 
  why bother learning english just to read bad translations of nietzsche , kant , goethe , einstein , luther ?
