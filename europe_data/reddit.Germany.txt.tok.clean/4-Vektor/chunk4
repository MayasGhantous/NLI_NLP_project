  ftfy , 
   difference really is that english is more expected to be broken . 
  exactly !, 
  90 % of the world speaks ~ ~ english ~ ~ pidgin , yet claims native speaker proficiency . 
  interesting . 
  and i thought hungarian was harder than german , so our language would be rather easy to learn for you . 
  same here . 
  two hours a week in nrw . 
  erdogan vs. g\u00fclen -- islamist vs. islamist it 's not like any of both `` sides '' could be suspected to be kemalists , even in the widest sense . 
  if long lists with tens of thousands of people who ought to be removed from society have n't given that theory already enough credence . 
  '' ... a 500 person human centipede to solve all his problems . '', 
  sounds legit . 
  there are professionals who do nothing but analyze ww2 aerial photos shot by the allies after bombings to identify bombs that did n't go off . 
  on average one bomb gets disarmed or destroyed by controlled explosion every single day . 
  especially in my area that got bombed a lot because of its huge industrial value . 
  ... in guantanamo . 
  that would be a good title for a really messed up movie . 
  i 'm no scholar and i told several people last year that it 's gon na happen pretty soon . 
  everyone with half a brain knew that erdogan 's policies would provoke a coup sooner or later . 
  and closer to the actual coup it became pretty clear something was going on . 
  i 've seen 4 coups in turkey during my lifetime , so there 's no magic to `` foreseeing '' this . 
  london and paris are just massively overpriced , that 's all . 
  becoming ? 
  duzen is highly dependent on the trade and the social circles you 're moving in . 
  [ austrian obsession with titles ] ( https://trivienna.wordpress.com/2013/06/23/austrians-and-titles/ ) has comedic proportions , though . 
  statistically , they most likely get raped or sexually assaulted by relatives or their own partners . 
  berlin is n't east germany . 
  it 's only a part of it . 
  an its 10 % are a big exception from the rest of the new federal states .

  oh , i do n't doubt your translation at all . 
  i was rather being sarcastic about the terrible quality of the google translate translation . 
  everything seems to be off in the gt version , not only the word order . 
  [ and i thought it could n't get weirder ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eun-kfr4pdw )  unfortunately this certainly interesting [ video about the mast , its construction principles and failure ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lbxpoegvqi ) is in polish . 
  but it has some nice shots of what it looked like after it failed . 
  according to one of the user comments on the webpage it was only around 8 \u00b0 c that day . 
  strange word order is a nice way to put it . 
  ** the attack on the american spy police in the video got in moscow . 
  ** mkay ... google translate ftw !, 
  erm ... 1/3 cm = 2/6 cm = 4/12 cm = 5/15 cm ( super convenient ) 1/3 '' = 0.333333333333333333333333333333333333333 '' ( nobody wants that ) that logic works in both ways . 
   i 'm not sure how a long list of equivalent fractions is more useful . 
  and i 'm not sure what you mean with metric inch . 
  inches are defined by the metric system . 
  since 1959 , 1 inch is defined as 25.4 mm . 
  well , as long as it 's consensual role play it 's not rape . 
  but both parties agree on the rules for that kind of stuff before engaging in such activities . 
  these parties tend to disintegrate due to shit like that and constant internal power struggles . 
  it shows how badly they are qualified for actual policy making . 
  i 'm aware of the date , but i highly doubt that it has changed very much . 
  but that 's just my gut feeling . 
  i tried to find data for 2016 on the european comission website , but apparently there have n't any been published yet . 
  i 'd love to see if and how much the data has changed since last year . 
  and i 'd love to see how much brexit ( completed or not ) will have changed the self-identification of eu citizens in a few months . 
  the afd dismantling itself ... again . 
  sometimes my schadenfreude can even be morally justifiable . 
  who 'd thunk that ? 
  [ this is fine . 
  i 'm okay with the events that are unfolding currently . 
  ] ( http://gunshowcomic.com/648 ), 
  and it proves that nationalism is rather a fringe phenomenon , despite the omnipresent reports about pegida and other movements , and even despite these movements and parties are getting a lot more vocal about their true nature . 
  my goodness , yes . 
  it 's unsettling to read official communication between grown adults that looks like texting between retarded middle schoolers . 
  reminds me of alkebu-lan and the according map . 
  edit : typo, 
  '' ... ~ ~ was ~ ~ is no plan . '', 
  present tense . 
  keep it real . 
  you forgot the nipple clamps . 
  yes , that 's how it feels like . 
  people should have paid more attention to [ his previous talk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ustypbked8y ) as well . 
  it would have been wise if more people had thought about a plan . 
  boris johnson is a weirdo , i do n't get what his appeal was ( is ) . 
  i understand the appeal of farage and his shtick , but i do n't get boris jonson . 
  let 's latinize it more properly : * nobilis iunior vult . 
  well , they did n't vote on `` let 's have a plan before we leave '' , so it makes sense . 
  rhetoric failures for dummies , chapter 1 . 
  sturgeon knew and knows very well that the eu ca n't negotiate with scotland in the current situation . 
  she 's not stupid . 
  but her visit sends a clear signal to scotland , the rest of the uk and to the eu . 
  she demonstrates that she has a plan , unlike certain other people . 
  this is an important signal , no matter if scotland can join the eu or if it will become independent at all . 
  ` do n't blame the voters , blame the eu . ', 
  nothing to see here , move on . 
  that writer should get fired immediately !, 
  yes , and half the fun of the movies was the cheesy soundtrack . 
  the typical `` eating beans out of a frying pan theme '' , the `` let 's slap the shit out of them '' theme ...  i still feel at home as soon as i hear the typical bud spencer and terence hill movie style music , haha . 
  i do n't doubt the original was popular in other countries . 
  i just find the original really bland and boring . 
  that 's just british sportsmaship . 
  you wrote `` embarrassing '' wrong . 
  weird . 
  it does in germany , or am i mistaken ? 
  yes , he had a german mother . 
  highschool works differently in germany . 
  gymnasium ( uni prep highschool ) was from grade 5 to grade 13 back then . 
  now it 's one year shorter in my federal state . 
  i was at a `` humanist '' type highschool ; my first foreign language was latin , from 5th to 12th grade , then english from 7th to 13th , and french from 9th to 12th grade . 
  brandt was a genius . 
  another show , the persuaders , is so boring , but his dialogue writing of the german dub made it actually funny and entertaining -- and so successful in germany . 
  tell wolfgang hess , not me .
