  nothing google or any other company does is for free . 
  google sells user and usage data to other companies . 
  last time i heard that tax optimization and selling that data helped google to be just profitable by a tiny margin . 
  turkey should clone him , so erdogan can suck himself off while getting sucked off by himself . 
  maybe he would calm down a bit after that . 
  yes , that 's what all the cctv cams in the uk are installed for . 
  the simple arithmetic you apply is the problem . 
  extrapolation of these things never worked very well , even for people whose understanding of things like population dynamics and statistical predictions is much better as yours . 
  that crystal ball you have -- how much did you pay for it ? 
  i have the feeling you got ripped off . 
  if ms word would just be able to produce professionally and beautifully typeset documents out of the box . 
  for godness ' sake , word does n't even have kerning enabled by default . 
  both words have different connotations and stress different aspects , which probably many people do n't even recognize . 
  * ex patria * : outside your ( real ) ** fatherland ** * emigrant * : moving out ( of anywhere ) maybe some people notice the * subtly * different message hidden behind term # 1 . 
  and i 'm quite sure it 's this subtle difference which made * expat * creep in to substitute the less patriotic sounding * emigrant * . 
  nobody wants effin ' * migrants * if they can have people called somethingsomething * fatherland * . 
  so , jews are less popular than germans in poland . 
  that 's surprising . 
  maybe i 'm just ignorant . 
  you 're right . 
  [ farage himself said it was even more than 350 million/week ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz2tvnvm6oa ) , a few weeks before the referendum . 
  as i said , that brass neck is second to none . 
   leading to theresa may condemning it whilst on a trip to saudi arabia , where they chop peoples heads off . 
  ... and feet and hands . 
  but they have oil and they buy weapons . 
  cadbury does n't . 
  well , farage is a dishonest cunt who loves to generalize and talks a lot of shit out of his arse . 
  east european organized groups are an actual problem that 's also warned and talked about e.g. 
  by the police in my german state where these groups went on burglary tours . 
  it 's not about a fantasy like e.g. 
  farage 's # 350 million promise for the nhs , which he -- what a surprise -- now calls a `` mistake '' . 
  this man 's brass neck is thicker than a mammoth tree . 
  not only in ireland . 
  he `` silently '' admirers the nazis and how they rose to power in the 1930 's .

  ah , thanks for the info . 
  depending on how close a result might be , 1 % can be quite important . 
  think of results similar to the brexit or the us popular vote . 
  i checked the numbers again . 
  according to [ dailysabah ] ( https://www.dailysabah.com/eu-affairs/2017/03/02/german-authorities-controversially-ban-turkish-ministers-from-meeting-citizens-in-rally ) there are 1.5 million voters in germany - the largest community outside turkey . 
  i do n't know why i misremembered that number . 
  so , more like just below 3 % , with about 53 million voters in total . 
  i guess the 2 % i mentioned are about the actual voter turnout , but i 'm not sure anymore . 
  i know that turks are n't all akp voters . 
  and i 'm also aware of the many rather secular turks ( often kurds ) who live in germany . 
  i was friends with a lot of them when i was at uni , and one of them was my girlfriend back then  yet , the majority in germany votes for akp , despite the fact that we both know people who do n't . 
  it 's a bit weird , but considering your answer , the leaflet kind of looks like a hamfisted attempt at turkish state propaganda directed at germans . 
  erdogan trying to play putin , just less sophisticated , 
  and they are the largest minority in germany . 
  the ~ 500,000 are those who vote iirc . 
  we have over 3 million turks/people with turkish roots in germany altogether . 
  and german turks were always important . 
  the majority are akp voters , and they are important enough for turkish politicians to come to germany for election campaigning . 
  or at least to try , in the light of the rallies that were denied lately . 
  basically , they are turkish citizens on turkish soil , are n't they ? 
  i guess the theoretical problems of dual turkish/german or turkish/dutch citizenship are n't so theoretical anymore . 
  and the 500,000 turks of voting age in germany make up 2 % of all turkish voters , so they are very important for the referendum . 
  2 % can make all the difference . 
  it 's an active act of looking away . 
  willful ignorance in great parts , and also a considerable amount of shameless propaganda and suppression of opposition with an iron fist . 
  slam on , erdogan !, 
  i 'm quite sure the 3rd or 4th turkish coup d\u2019\u00e9tat i 've witnessed in my life might not be the last one in turkey during my lifetime . 
  higher efficiency ? 
  much more propaganda experience . 
  spending everything they have without worrying about the consequences . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  a very entertaining and informative read . 
  nah , just do n't be impressed by international achievements that are quite unique in the younger history of earth . 
  it 's frowned upon on reddit . 
  reddit is only impressed by donald trump and cute animals . 
   did you yesterday still to the city went ? 
  i guess a more correct direct translation would be ** are you yesterday yet to the city gone ? 
  ** i assume `` zijn '' is a form of the auxiliary verb `` to be '' ( sein in german ) , and gegaan is the participle of go ( gegangen in german ) , nog being `` noch '' in german , 
  yes , kana cover the complete syllabic repertoire of the japanese language . 
  to be honest , learning katakana and hiragana is ridiculously easy and everyone should be done with learning both in 2 weeks or so . 
  besides , hiragana are used for case particles , katakana for foreign words etc. 
  so you need to know them even if you would n't write whole sentences in hiragana only . 
  except in the king james bible  lots of thous , thees , thys and thines , 
  unless you are in the ruhr area where people use the actually un-german continuous form `` am + verb '' . 
   `` ich bin am essen . '' instead of `` ich esse ( gerade ) . '' -- `` i 'm eating . '', 
  latin was my first foreign language at school . 
  thank goodness i went that route instead of english first . 
  latin ( and presumably greek ) are great model languages to learn a very structured approach to grammar . 
  not all of them . 
  do n't scare the poor guy to death . 
  no , that 's rule # 0815 . 
  chinatown , anyone ? 
  seriously , it 's rather easy . 
  strictly stay with `` your own people '' , keep your wife and daughters inside the house at all times , and you have the perfect ghetto . 
  and , not to forget , it took over a decade to arrive at the current state of affairs e.g. 
  between the eu and switzerland . 
  it 's not a deal that was made overnight . 
  edit : and it 's not just a single deal with switzerland . 
  it 's a collection of several tens of agreements and deals . 
  i assume the allusion to the [ stab-in-the-back myth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stab-in-the-back_myth ) ( dolchsto\u00dflegende ) is pure coincidence , right ? 
  still more subtle than merkel with a hitler mustache . 
  '' , `` right ?

  honestly , is anyone surprised about this revelation ? 
  iirc , throwing away stale baguette is actually a rather big contributor to wasted food in france .
