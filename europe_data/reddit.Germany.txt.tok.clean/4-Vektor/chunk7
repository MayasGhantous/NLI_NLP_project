  ha , you should check youtube for some videos of thatcher back then . 
  this looks quite arbitrary . 
  that 's not how heraldry works . 
  edit : like \u2192 how, 
  i was a young horny boy once , too . 
  just around the time when teresa orlowski was still big in germany , shortly before her stardom started to fade . 
  some things in life you never forget . 
  and often these are n't the most useful things . 
  but this was in the news and the title was so ridiculous that it was hard to forget . 
  well , this useless bit of memory proved to be useful at least once in my life . 
  on reddit , 24 years later . 
  was it probably orlowski 's ** jurassic fuck ** that she had to rename because of a striking similarity to another popular dinosaur movie back then ? 
  i have to say that changing the title to ** angriff der pornosaurier ** ( attack of the pornosaurs ) was n't the best choice . 
  [ here ] ( https://xhamster.com/movies/1062801/angriff_der_pornosaurier_full_movie.html ) is an ** nsfw ** link for the history buffs among you guys . 
  good old times ... and [ here is a short spiegel article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9289046.html ) ( from 1993 , in german ) about this film and the problems with spielberg 's german distributor . 
  fake news !, 
  it was a hand-written piece of paper : i \u026fant on ^ e g * a * zi ** l ** o ^ \u2115 d \u00b0 l \u2203 \u1d3f\u01a7 dol ^ an trupm, 
  guys like erdogan do n't need a reason to be angry or feel ridiculed . 
  that 's their default state of mind . 
  besides , why would we stop criticising him just to prevent him from feeling criticised ? 
  he sees enemies all around himself , everytime and everywhere . 
  he 's paranoid and he has severe delusions of grandeur . 
  nothing will stop him from going batshit crazy . 
  if he is ignored by others , he 'll just invent an attack on his `` honor '' or whatever . 
  that 's how he works . 
  this is how dictators or wannabes have done it throughout history . 
  we need more world wars for a statistically meaningful result . 
  pretty much none . 
  compare it to ** now ** , that 's something i did n't expect . 
  ** why ** , thank you . 
  you would n't translate either of both literally to german `` jetzt '' ( now ) or `` warum '' ( why ) because they do n't have these functions or meanings in these contexts . 
  edit : typo, 
  and learning idioms and idiomatic expressions . 
  exactly . 
  it means `` by itself '' , not `` by say '' . 
  no , not the moomins !, 
  do n't ruin my childhood !, 
  what if said leader is a pansexual frutarian pastafarian ? 
  i hate frutarians . 
  this poll is too unspecific . 
  wow , and it is n't even circumcised . 
  how ironic . 
  ** - chen ** there you have the answer . 
  it 's a diminuitive form of magd ( maid ) . 
  diminuitive forms are grammatically neuter . 
  the translation is a bit off :  junge osteurop\u00e4er wollen freiz\u00fcgigkeit , aber keine fl\u00fcchtlinge ( young eastern europeans want free movement , but no ~ ~ t for ~ ~ refugees . ), 
   ftfy, 
  nah , they 'd display finest british high brow humor ... maybe something with merkel rocking a hitler mustache , or an eussr poster . 
  a parent in denial . 
  it 's not a first in history . 
  us quantum facts mechanics at work again . 
   but the freedom to manifest your religion publicly has much less purchase , especially if you 're a muslim . 
  yeah , that 's why crosses on classroom walls got banned in germany . 
  because muslims / s god forbid ( pun intended ) that european countries have different legal traditions than the us . 
  turkish state representatives are n't allowed to campaign outside of turkey in the first place . 
  it 's against your own fucking law , erdogan . 
  stop lecturing us on democracy , you wannabe dictator . 
  and yet , the whole campaigning was about a whole lot of other issues , like foreigners , refugees , 350 million pounds for the nhs , all kinds of shit farage came up with , muh sovereignty , fishing rights , you name it . 
  edit : leave the eu or not is not a simple issue without knowing the potential consequences , the time frame etc. 
  the campaigns showed that it was a mess of disinformation and name calling , poor communication or just plain lying . 
  it 's a simple looking question , but it 's not a simple issue . 
  [ this is an interesting and funny read ] ( http://japaneseruleof7.com/crime-in-japan/ ) about crime in japan . 
  underreporting of crime is a big problem in japan , though . 
  just as an example , a few years ago , osaka police fudged the numbers and did n't report over 80,000 crime incidents in their reports . 
  and , as in so many other countries , sexual assault is severely underreported as well . 
  [ japan 's safety myth ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/12/29/voices/discussing-sex-crimes-japans-safety-myth/ ) [ another article about cultural reasons ] ( http://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/japan-is-a-safe-country-a-myth-and-reality-different-faces-of-crimes-in-japan/138832/ ) for low crime numbers . 
  [ japan has exceptionally low crime rates . 
  but there 's a dark side to its justice system . 
  ] ( http://www.vox.com/world/2015/12/13/9989250/japan-crime-conviction-rate ) ( vox article ) [ the secret of japan 's mysteriously low crime rate ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/blog/?p=74 ) ( nationmaster.org )  what are most disturbing are however arguments that the low crime is partially a result of a police culture that are obsessed with keeping crime statistics low . 
  former detectives claim that police is unwilling to investigate homicides unless there is a clear suspects and frequently labels unnatural deaths as suicides without performing autopsies . 
  coincidentally , japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the world . 
  and he ~ ~ w ~ ~ would make the end of the accession talks look like a win : he saved turkey from accessing the two-faced lying banana republic nazi bastards of the eu . 
  he wins either way , internally . 
  at least in the short term . 
  i thought you were kidding when you mentioned the underwear brand , haha . 
  yeah , banana republic is an actual term , not just something erdogan made up . 
  now that you know what it means , you can see how ridiculous erdogan is when he throws stupid things like this at other nations . 
  thanks for the link , fenixstorm1 . 
  your idea of rationality is rather interesting , to say the least . 
  from a rational point of view only women should have the right to vote because they live longer than men and have to suffer the consequences of any decision for a longer time . 
  you can build `` rational '' arguments for any case . 
  besides , it 's not really an achievement if a country ( or a canton ) is unable to introduce women 's voting rights before the mid 20th century . 
  equality of people is usually part of the constitution of most countries i know . 
  and that 's an achievement that dates back to the enlightenment . 
  and yes , women 's rights were and often still are not implemented everywhere , which is a shame . 
  you would n't call one of the slowest participants in a 1000 m race the 59th best achiever , either . 
  i 'd rather say : it was about time . 
  and do n't worry , switzerland is not the only country which can be slow or backwards if it 's about implementing certain things . 
  there are similar examples in other countries as well . 
  we still do n't have gay marriage in germany , for example . 
  but i would n't try to talk about an actual introduction , later than most other countries , as an achievement or big success . 
  it 's overdue . 
  i made up what ? 
  you 're seeing things . 
  and you 're defending a standpoint that i did n't attack in the first place . 
  you are aware that referendums are not uniquely held in switzerland , i hope . 
  and what i said was not directed at any specific country but a general view i have on any referendum . 
   and referendums should only be held on very specific issues , not on anything with a scope that is much too wide for a simple yes or no decision . 
  what 's wrong about that ? 
  where did i attack `` one of the most successful countries on the planet '' ?
