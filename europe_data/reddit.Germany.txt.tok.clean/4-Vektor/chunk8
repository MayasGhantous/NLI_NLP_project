  referendums should always held on single and simple issues , not on complex ones that ca n't be voted on by just yes or no . 
  ** should ** , in contrast to how they are ** actually ** held in reality in many cases or countries ( excluding switzerland , of course ) . 
  again , nowhere did i downplay your successful country . 
  the brexit referendum , however , to give you a different example , was about a much more complex issue , and both pro and contra campaigns showed that a multitude of issues were talked about during these campaigns . 
  and every party made the brexit referendum about a different issue . 
  complex problems should be broken down to simple ones , so that everyone has a chance to wrap their heads around . 
  there was so much misunderstanding and misinformation going around during the brexit campaign that you can take it as a prime example for how a referendum should not be held . 
  switzerland does it most likely in a much more appropriate way . 
  the swiss hold referendums all the time on hundreds of issues . 
  and they do n't just wrap up 50 different issues in one referendum . 
  other countries fuck it up . 
  and this is my point of argument . 
  funny how this man calls germany , holland and denmark nazis while he forbids referendum campaigning in his own fucking country . 
  he 's completely out of touch . 
  and it 's the most important duty of any secular european country to stand against his dictatorial shitshow . 
  there is no compromise to make on eu soil with this ruler who 's trying so hard to get rid of democratic structures as basic as the separation of powers . 
  indeed . 
  and referendums should only be held on very specific issues , not on anything with a scope that is much too wide for a simple yes or no decision . 
  he really hates dissenters , huh ? 
  and this is the guy who calls germany a banana republic . 
  you did n't get at all what it was about . 
  muh freedom of speech , this reflex is just childish and has nothing to do with the german flag thing we were talking about . 
  besides , freedom of speech * is for private citizens * does not mean freedom of consequences `` muh freedom of speech '' is also limited in the us . 
  and you obviously have no clue how life in germany is , or that different legal traditions do n't mean that `` freedom '' ~ ~ only ~ ~ only exists in america . 
  anyways , there 's no obligation to visit germany ... you 're free to decide against it . 
  even in germany . 
  well , i explained it in detail . 
  appropriate in one context , not appropriate in another context . 
  it has to do with her two political functions . 
  see above . 
  there is n't much else that i can say . 
  american culture is swamped with flags . 
  it 's ubiquitous and can barely be avoided . 
  this is in stark contrast to most european countries , i would say . 
  different associations with the state symbols , and different histories play into it as well . 
  but in the case of this video , i already described why it was perfectly fine to put the flag away for the group photo . 
  maybe you have asperger 's ? 
  do you have problems reading emotions in people 's faces ? 
  g\u00fclenists do n't try to implement anti-constitutional stuff in germany . 
  scientology is ( or was ) under surveillance because the very basis of their cult is against the german constitution . 
  edit : spelling, 
  did you read my first explanation at all ? 
  yeah , do n't think much about it . 
  as i said , a lot of americans wo n't get the subtleties i was talking about . 
   what do you mean with cdu not being related to germany as a whole ? 
  it 's a political party in germany . 
  yes , it 's a political party ** in ** germany . 
  it 's not the representative ** of ** germany . 
  merkel was on a party congress in her function of ** party leader ** , not in her function of ** head of government ** . 
   and the what are you talking about the pledge of allegiance being an ad campaign ? 
  because the `` she hates her country '' argument stems from exactly this perspective . 
  it sounds like a typical argument either an american would come up with , or a far-right politician who tries to beat the jingoism drum . 
  the `` holy '' american flag that americans learn to pledge allegiance to from an early age . 
  it 's a fucking piece of cloth . 
  and the pledge of allegiance was basically started as a campaign to sell more flags . 
  knowing this origin makes this pledge look even more awkward from a german perspective . 
   `` we do n't equate our flag with our country . '', 
  well it 's called the german flag for a reason , is n't it ? 
  you just answered your own rhetorical question . 
  it 's called the german flag . 
  but it 's not called germany . 
  see the difference . 
  that 's what the difference between `` equate '' and `` symbol for '' is about . 
  see above about american overly patriotic worship of the flag in contrast to that . 
  everything i wrote here i already argued about above . 
  maybe try to read it again . 
  it was a cdu congress , an internal party congress , not related to germany as a whole . 
  the politician trying to play patriot flag waving man tried to make it rather look like `` cdu = germany '' . 
  and merkel , as the head of this party , just gave the flag to another person for the group photo , which was supposed to show the party was united in and by itself , not trying to play some `` usa !, 
  usa ! '' style flag waving contest . 
  merkel is the head of government , and the head of her party at the same time . 
  both are different official functions , and merkel is aware of this difference , unlike the flag waving guy . 
  again : she saw that flag waving in her context of head of party was inappropriate . 
  she was there in the function of party leader , not head of government . 
  it was an internal party congress about internal topics , not about flag waving or posing as the one party that stands for germany as a whole . 
  context is everything . 
  taking photos and video snippets out of context is how propaganda and `` alternative facts '' work . 
  and i get it that a lot of americans do n't seem to understand the difference . 
  that 's what happens if you grow up with pledging allegiance to a piece of cloth every single day of your childhood , an allegiance that started as an ad campaign to sell more flags , basically . 
  there is no pseudo-religious worship to our flag . 
  we do n't equate our flag with our country . 
  the flag is not germany , it is a symbol for germany . 
  we do n't worship our flag . 
  this has nothing to do with hatred , and it can be different in different contexts . 
  i assume subtleties like these are not the strengths of a lot of people , though . 
  but maybe it 's a bit hard to understand for some people . 
  i have , and it 's shit . 
  the flag `` incident '' video clip with his voiceover `` she hates germany '' is enough to know this video is just crap . 
  muh freedom of speech . 
  sorry , we 're not the us . 
  the us constitution and the amendments do n't mean shit in europe . 
   common german people need to stand up - rise up - stop voting in these cucks . 
  these arent realgermans - they are fake germans the youtube comment section never lets you down . 
  got stones thrown at me and friends in scotland by french kids from the alsace region . 
  in 1994 , which tells a nice story about parents keeping the hate alive . 
  they started throwing stones at us as soon as they heard we were germans , although i spoke french to them . 
  i guess it 's better now , more than 20 years later . 
  to be fair , the vast majority of people who talk about the western `` crusaders '' in germany are salafists . 
  they talk about this all the time . 
  i would say , exceptions prove the rule .
