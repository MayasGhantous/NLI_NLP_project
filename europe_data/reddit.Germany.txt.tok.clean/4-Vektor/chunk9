  there was another guy who loved to talk about us `` crusaders '' all day long : bin laden . 
  revenge is dumb . 
  it 's time to grow up . 
  does n't sound too different from saudi arabia as an economic partner . 
  is it a gr\u00fcn \u00d6gren ? 
  especially because the assassination attempt in 1990 that put him in a wheelchair in the first place was already bad enough . 
  that 's great !, 
  okay , that makes more sense . 
  i just googled and saw that dutch turnout in 2012 was almost 75 % . 
  i was already wondering ... 
  i thought the 33 % were a projection for the whole day and could n't believe it . 
  wow , a voter turnout of 27 % ... that 's so horribly low . 
  damn , der spiegel already talked about a threat to democracy when voter turnouts were falling in germany , but still over 70 % ( in 2013 ) : http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/decline-in-voter-turnout-in-germany-a-danger-to-democracy-a-923081.html edit : calm down , everyone , it was just a misinterpretation by me . 
  see a few lines below . 
  which could be a long time if the majority of turks are stupid enough to vote yes in the referendum . 
  i think chances of becoming an eu member have become rather slim a few hours ago . 
  erdowahn has finally lost it completely . 
  my goodness , that blog is so edgy that you cut your eyes while reading it . 
  she should wear a hipster beard to make it perfect . 
  in short : it 's boring teenage-level shit . 
  edit : the blog is at least twice as edgy if you read it aloud with an austrian accent . 
  it does n't even matter if the girls wear a headscarf or not . 
  if someone bullies and degrades any chidren then he or she is a piece of shit . 
  edit : wording, 
  well done !, 
  yeah , i know . 
  these compound nouns are typical for germanic languages . 
  english also has closed compounds like * firefly * , * horseradish * , * flowerpot * , * carryover * on top of that ... oh , and hyphenated compounds , too . 
  we call them ** deppenleerzeichen ** ( fool 's spaces ) , or , to make the point even clearer , ** deppen leer zeichen ** . 
  sometimes it 's also called ** plenk ** , a joke anglicism of `` blank '' . 
  what works for putin should also work for erdogan , right ? 
  i respect your optimism , but i do n't believe in `` creative ideas '' . 
  the world as a whole ca n't manage to work together in even the most basic things . 
  no deus ex machina will save us . 
  and the hope for `` creative ideas '' is like hoping for this to happen . 
  we had lots of creative ideas , and none of them were realized on a global scale . 
  and we better do what has to be done -- cut down on exploiting the only resources we have . 
  we have done it already for too long , and there is n't much wiggle room left . 
  in the end , a few generations down the line , our children 's children will pay the price . 
  if you ignore the desertification of other areas , i guess . 
  his hair dye . 
  the european far right -- sponsored by breitbart and the fsb . 
  nice to see the cooperation between the militaries worked so well .

  this is visual poetry !, 
  enjoy my upvote . 
  now that 's a surprise for sure !, 
  thank you anyway , 
  cool , thanks !, 
  how does that remind me bot work again ? 
  it 's almost as if you could follow the spread of the disease just by following the names . 
  i wish chalmers johnson were still alive . 
  we do n't give a shit anymore . 
  we got hitler comparisons on a regular basis , the effect has worn off . 
  even british tabloids almost gave up on this , which should be a good indicator . 
  i only hope the german political echo will get less subtle . 
  the time of vague statements is over , no matter if erdo tries to play games with the `` threat '' of releasing all the refugees into the `` wild '' again . 
  we really need to take a stand and tell what we want and what we do n't want . 
  * we * , as in germany and the eu . 
  a rather small majority , to be honest . 
  but the `` popular vote '' does n't matter as long as the voting system does n't get fixed . 
  minority rule should n't be possible . 
  and in the current system the popular vote does n't count in the end . 
  that was before the eec , though , was n't it ? 
   on the continent which already shows a different kind of ignorance . 
  but this also shows that this distinction is a british thing , which also showed in uk politics towards the ~ ~ others ~ ~ continent , despite being an eu member themselves . 
  i 'm not sure if this kind of argumentation leads to anything useful , though . 
  even after brexit the uk will still be part of europe . 
  but i guess one could argue it 's politically the 51st us state anyway , despite all british `` my sovereignty '' talk . 
  theoretical balkanization map without the balkans . 
  none -- [ see above ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wdps3/germany_hate_crime_nearly_10_attacks_a_day_on/de9sky5/ ) . 
  ugh , do n't remind me ... 
  indeed . 
  even his inauguration speech sounded like something an awkward 5th-grader would say after he was voted to become class representative . 
   paris is still a lovely ~ ~ city ~ ~ country . 
  we 're talking about trump , mate !, 
   `` paris !, 
  you know paris ? 
  it 's a beautiful country , really beautiful . 
  believe me . 
  and now ? 
  total disaaaaaaster !, 
  a disaster . 
  really . 
  paris is no longer paris . 
  it 's sad . 
  total disaster . 
  yuuge disaster , paris . '' just exchange paris with any other european city you like and you 'll have the content for his next 50 statements about the disaaaaaaastrous situation in europe . 
  edit : i hope everyone is aware i just made this up . 
  it 's not an actual quote . 
  i just used his favorite rhetorical figure : the repetitive non-sequitur . 
  go to youtube , search for `` michael dougan '' , watch his videos . 
  try to comprehend them . 
  then come back and bring forth any valid arguments you have . 
  for the same reasons other people think that a narcissist with the reading comprehension and rhetorical prowess of a 4th grader , is presidential material . 
  at least do it properly and spy on everyone , like in the uk , the us , canada , new zealand , australia ... five eyes -- that 's how it 's done professionally . 
  on a serious note , the bnd has been a mess for a while , so it 's not surprising . 
  yes , and to keep this centipede from talking back all the time .
