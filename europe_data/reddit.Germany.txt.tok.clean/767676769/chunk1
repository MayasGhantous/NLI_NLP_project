do n't forget you are talking to a german here , we gon na make it happen . 
  jesus , chill . 
  you better change your flair from `` moody parisian '' to `` moody douche '' . 
  i knew this was common in serbia and montenegro ( ? 
  ) , but in the netherlands ... go figure . 
  putin , the bill laimbeer of world politics . 
  you fuck off , it 's a joke calm your titties . 
  because i 'm not a serb , that 's why . 
   literally all of your comments on this sub are about serbia . 
  they are `` literally '' not . 
  i do n't care about their relations , it 's just funny how adamant you are about proving that they have relations like any other country in europe . 
  that 's why i 'm telling you to just let it go , you 've been doing that for months , it 's just a waste of time . 
  you are n't going to sway anyone 's opinion with it , greeks and serbians probably know how they feel about their relations , and other countries simply do n't give a shit . 
   also , you felt them closer to you , not to us . 
  but you are speaking for `` us '' as in `` all greeks '' , huh ? 
  get a grip on yourself dude , half of your reddit activity is fighting against the notion that greece and serbia have `` good relations '' , let it go . 
  that does n't even make any sense . 
  you 're just a guy from kosovo hating on serbia in every thread it is mentioned in for the sake of it . 
  where can i watch this movie ? 
   you sound like some mafia leader what the hell am i reading , do you know what basic social interaction is ... ya ever heard of someone joking around ? 
  do n't bother dude , this guy is fucked in the head . 
  he 's so blinded by hatred of anything croatian or serbian that it made him paranoid . 
  that is true ( i even remember reading that here on this sub ) , but it 's just getting repetetive when this buttmaybee guy - a bosnian/bosniak ( ? ), 
  who hates everything croatian and especially serbian - obviously pushes his anti-serbia agenda on every single thread about serbia ( i mean dude called `` republika srpska '' literally isis , ca n't get more youtube comment section-y than that ) . 
  i 'm definitely not against people voicing their concerns about `` serbia being a trojan horse '' , i 'm just against people like him blatantly doing it to ciclejerk and wanting to get other people to `` hate '' serbia . 
  that 's because you hate serbia , we get it dude, 
  jesus christ , calm down keyboard warrior, 
  the other mods are smart ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ban ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ pls, 
  and this consolidates the stereotype, 
  almost every comment in your comment history starts with `` trumpettes '' ... are you okay ? 
  they are so based that they are apparently even too based for life itself, 
  i just do n't get it , why do people always get so upset when they see this guy , yes it is already known that he does n't like serbia , but who the fuck actually cares . 
  why do people see the greek flag beside his user name and immediately assume `` do all greeks think like this ? 
  i thought greeks like serbia ? '' . 
  greeks are also individuals , not all of them hold the same opinions . 
  i do get that this guy is really annoying and shows up in every goddamn thread serbia is mentioned in and i do get that his potrayal of `` most greeks think like this '' while they obviously do n't is also annoying , but as i already said , who the fuck cares . 
  i do n't get why you guys change your mind because of one dude thinking some countries are not `` bros '' . 
  greeks are also individuals , i can imagine that a lot of greeks have a `` positive opinion '' of serbia and/or serbians and some are indifferent to it or do n't like it . 
  do n't be as one-dimensional as this mindalero idiot who thinks he 's representing all greeks by saying `` most greeks do n't care about _____ tbh '' . 
  i do n't know , all three were pale and looked `` germanic '' and hitler `` even '' had blue eyes , so they definitely would n't have been picked on for being gypsies in eastern europe , stop talking nonsense . 
  and it is n't about how blonde or how blue-eyed someone is/was , as long as you are a slav you were a subhuman in their eyes , they did n't give a fuck about that , it was n't like `` oh well , this pole looks really really aryan , let 's spare him i guess '' . 
   what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  complete bullshit of course you would n't get what i was going for , sigh ... `` there 's nothing funny here , you are albanian while i 'm not an serb . 
  that 's the truth . '', 
  you do you dude , keep being an idiot . 
   always the victim that would be the baltic mentality , i mean you even started with the `` muh russia '' talk classic, 
   what the hell are you saying little chetnik the probability of you being albanian just rose to 99 %, 
  yeah dude , totally . 
  the usa bombing someone without un authorization makes them not just good guys , i would dare to say this makes them the best guys there is . 
  the usa has shown time after time that they 're only acting out of the goodness of their heart ... are you an idiot ? 
  lol , nice try , saying `` we 're so alike '' to a `` real '' central european country , i 'm seeing right through you slovenia, 
  lovely comment , who would n't like to have a discussion with a condescending ass whose only argument is the parodical and exaggerated potrayal of the `` other side 's '' arguments ? 
  seriously though , i 've seen more whiny nonsensical comments like yours than these `` evil fascist '' ones that you are talking about . 
  you either really do n't see how flawed your logic is or you 're being deliberately obtuse . 
   or you are just a deflecting breitbart troll bot . 
  oh boy , here we go again ... 
  what is this yank talking about, 
  you had me going there for a second malthe, 
  i do n't like this channel ... at all , that said , that was one of their `` better '' videos, 
  well , if really some of your buddies from day one are albanians , i can once again believe in good relations between greece and albania, 
  but it did, 
   i ca n't see the situation improving you 're right with that , it wo n't improve , it 'll ony get worse and it will be a huge problem in a couple of decades, 
  tell them to `` make '' their firstborn on bosnian soil and convert it to islam ( so the kid will be croatian , serbian , and bosnian ) , then make him/her the emperor of new-yugoslavia and badabing badabum , all problems solved , peace in the balkans at last . 
  `` how to breed with camels 101 '', 
  no , it 's not `` by the same logic '' , your logic is inherently flawed . 
  they ca n't `` join '' kosovo , shall their be yet another unilateral declaration , hell yeah , who cares about dumb irrelevant stuff like territorial integrity and constitutions , right ? 
  that 's like someone grabbing a slice of your pizza without your consent , and then negotiating with you like `` hey , if you give me some of your pepperoni topping then i 'll give you some of my cheese '' . 
  how dumb would you have to be to agree to a trade like this ? 
  this is really bugging me too ( more than i 'd care to admit ) , but i do n't know how i exactly feel about people who get their news solely from facebook either ... 
  i do n't know what you are exactly implying , but brexit would 've probably still happened the demographics that are mostly using facebook did n't bother to vote , why would a fake news filter change that, 
   past 5 years sucking up to the eu the best he could ? 
  the past 5 years were probably the reason why they started to take him seriously . 
   it actually makes sense because you where the one who brought up the macedonia dispute honest question , how does it make sense ? 
  i just do n't get it , was it because we were in a `` shit on serbia '' thread so let 's compare it to serbia , because why not ? 
  we were talking about `` passive aggressive '' measures taken by a government , like this goddamned train or greece `` sanctioning '' macedonia . 
  comparing it to any full blown war or genocide makes macedonias problems insignificant . 
  `` macedonias struggle is nothing compared to croatia exterminating half a million serbs , jews , and gypsies '' or `` macedonias struggle is nothing compared to nazi germany exterminating six million jews '' , see , how does that make any sense except for someone trying to push an agenda ? 
  why should macedonia care about , i do n't know , the armenian or greek genocide by ottomans , it 's not going to make them `` feel better '' , because someone has done something worse in history . 
  it 's just you wanting to shit on serbia because the people in that thread were upvote-happy for stuff like that . 
  i really do n't believe our election is as `` threatened '' by fake news as the american election is/was . 
  this election is n't even going to be as 1/100 as divisive as the american one . 
  the only thing i see here is freedom of speech being threatened . 
  for example all anti-imigrant posts on facebook being zucced is going to backfire big time . 
  this would be the first step to creating a divisive atmosphere like the media did in the usa . 
  i really do n't see a scenario where this `` fight against fake news '' is working out . 
  `` i did n't say anything negative now , but 95 % of my comments are '' i mean dude , i do n't actually care , that 's not my fight , but i already replied to one of your other comments talking about macedonias struggles because of greece , and you bring up what serbia did in the 90s without it having to do anything with our conversation , what the hell ? 
  and surprise surprise , you commented on every one of these serbia threads ( and btw i fail to see why these threads are still being made or people like you still comment on them , it 's essentially about this train and the serbian pm threatening kosovo , no need to circlejerkt it for the 100th time ) and nevermind i click on this thread and chose to `` confront '' you about this here rather than on these 1000 comment threads where albanians/croats/kosovars / serbs are probably just waiting to get involved in such a comment chain . 
  ok so every other `` normal '' person would think `` phew , ok , i handed my opinion out now , i do n't see a reason to say it 10 more times on other threads with the same topic '' , but it seems like you are are having a strong inclination to do this , for whatever reason ( and i 'm seemingly not the first person to `` accuse '' - this sounds like an insult , but it is n't of course - you of being an albanian greek , because i just do n't see a greek feeling such an urge to comment on this so much ) . 
  and you having serbian friends or classmates is so irrelevant for this discussion lol , what do you want to prove by this ? 
  that you do n't hate every single serb ? 
  i never said that , i said `` anti-serbia sentiment '' . 
  i have vietnamese , greek , kosovar , croat , serbian , bosnian , afghan , and turk friends , does this make me a friend of all greek/croat / ... people or something ? 
  no , i like these people because of their personalities , just as you probably liked your serbian friend , so do n't use this as a justification for whatever reason . 
  can we stop having these threads ( which are all essentially about this train and/or their pm threatening kosovo ) so people like you can not have the time of their lives circlejerking and pushing their agenda ( whatever it might be , i mean seriously look at the comments your make ) ? 
  these threads are getting predictable and annoying . 
  yugoslavs maybe ? 
  jesus dude , what 's with your anti-serbia sentiment , and actively searching for threads serbia is mentioned to shit on it . 
  lay it off , will you ? 
  are you an albanian born/living in greece , because that 's the impression you are giving with your constant moaning . 
  no normal person would go out of one 's way to comment on every single thread .
