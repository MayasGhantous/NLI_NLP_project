  but if they attacked the train would n't they be the `` bad guys '' for a reason ? 
  there 's a difference between provocation and actual violence . 
  you are acting like albanians are animals without a conscience , when they see this train they 're gon na attack it no matter what , and well they ca n't be blamed for it , because just like when you provoke a wild animal , it 's gon na bite ya ? 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm on reddit or on a youtube video right now , because this comment is awfully similar to what nationalistic idiots are saying in youtube comment sections `` yu so weak , git bumbed by nato , yu git bumbed by nato , yu so weak , do n't yu dare or bumb again '', 
   and our entire northern provinces claimed by their school propaganda ? 
  keep your eu-expansion fantasies to yourself . 
  fyrom is a craphole and will remain outside of the eu as long as they keep teaching their kids that greek territory is theirs , and they keep putting up statues of alexander the great and philip of macedon . 
  i agree with you . 
  the macedonian government has made itself a laughing stock because of this , but that 's not a reason for how greece has and still is handling this . 
  and i 'm from bavaria buddy , i could n't care less about north germany , you 're right , i would n't be mature , i would probably thank them lol and i 'm realising right now that i 'm arguing with two different greeks , you and the kosovo sympathizer i actually replied to before . 
  same can be said about croatia to be honest , well the `` unresolved/unrealised extreme nationalistic ideologies '' at least . 
  no , i do n't wan na play your balkan game . 
  that 's the definition of `` play stupid games win stupid prizes '' . 
  what has this to do with `` what serbs did in the 90s '' , what the hell ? 
  we were talking about how petty of a move it is to send this kind of train to kosovo , then you said that the greek government has n't reached this level of pettiness ( in relation to the train thing ) yet , which it absolutely has ( they sank to even lower levels , heck , greece ' handling of this `` conflict '' is the probably the definition of political and governmental pettiness ) . 
  it 's not a walk in the park for macedonia , why should/would they care about what serbs did in the fucking 90s lol , it 's happening now and it 's hindering any eu-progress macedonia is making , because of some petty greeks having their petty feelings hurt . 
  yeah of course , but it 's not going to happen without some big conflict ( which nobody with a functioning brain hopes for ) happening , and the second best thing is getting something `` in return '' for it or what 's more likely using it as leverage for something, 
  yeah , but you know , it 's just your usual fear/hate of russia by finland and the baltics, 
  oh yeah dude , that 's the thing the macedonians are fearing the most , a fucking train saying `` fyrom is fake macedonia '' the embargo and hindering of any accession talks with the eu and whatnot were a walk in the park compared to this atrocity, 
  cmon , we all know they do n't even want kosovo anymore ( or should i rather say they are smart enough to know there 's not really a chance - without a war that is , and how likely is that come on - to get it back ) , no offense but who would genuinely want this hellhole to be part of one 's country . 
  it 's clear they want something `` in exchange '' for `` losing '' kosovo , and i mean honestly they would be dumb if they 'd let it go just just like that . 
  it 's not about morals or ethics , it just about having some kind of bargaining chip . 
  eh , tell that to macedonia, 
  watch out , europe . 
  we are getting tired of paranoid r/politics users posting `` russia haxing this and russia haxing that '' every goddamn day ... 
  i do n't know about you , but munich 's a winter wonderland right now hehe, 
  that 's one way of saying that you do n't have any arguments, 
  nah , it looks pretty german , trust me but i understand where you 're coming from , let me guess , you 've used the metro and/or been in the city centre a.k.a marienplatz or stachus ? 
  there are really a lot of `` brown people '' ( arabs , turks , `` syrians '' or rather afghans ) in the city , and surprisingly a lot of asians , too . 
  but that 's no secret , muslims or minorities in general are living mostly in the city centres or close to it . 
  the farther you go away from the city centre , the fewer minorities you 'll see . 
  funnily enough a lot of exchange students said the same or asked me `` is this really germany ? '', 
  lol ( mostly the asian and eastern european ones , they can be pretty outspoken sometimes ), 
  ok this maps are really starting to annoy me , especially when they come from - no offense - baltic countries who just throw 5 countries from the balkans together and call them `` ussr '' or `` it 's complicated '' ( despite your average european probably having no clue what the baltic countries are called or just bluntly saying `` russia/ussr '' ) just because they 're too lazy to come up with something orginal ( for example i like the map u/kvizer suggested ) however this map is at least 10-times better/funnier than the latvian one doe . 
  i actually agree with you , but cmon , you are not exactly in the position to call other people `` shills '' , you are commenting on r/politics and r/enoughtrumpspam ( which are as bad as r/t _ d , glad i filtered all three of them ) and to be honest , your anti-russia sentiments are taking on a paranoid scale, 
  ok , as far as i understand this comment chain the answer to this problem is , that you are arguing with someone who represents what only a minority of greeks think . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but it just sounds like that . 
   so what you are saying is actually true the `` actually '' really gets me . 
  you act like you already knew all that , but you proceed not to understand it , like at all . 
  this guy dismantled all of your pseudo-arguments , and all you can say it 's useless , because it was developed at a time when europe was ruled by 5 monarchical empires , which is n't even the thing he wanted to convey to you.what a petty attempt at refuting his comment . 
  that 's just a sad commentary on the american education system, 
   ethnicity does n't exist quoting my fellow countryman in this thread : feels  reals, 
  the `` do n't fucking care '' - attitude never crossed my mind when thinking about ireland . 
  i mean op gave enough fucks to make this map , so leaving out these countries is just lazy or it even seems like he has never heard of these countries at all lol, 
  that 's one of the laziest ones yet, 
  south-german \u00fcbermensch checking in, 
   it 's literally nothing ok , now you 've lost all your credibility, 
   therefore '' ______ '' just returned to the rightful owners this argumentation is highly retarded and should n't be used , especially when you talk about things that date back thousands of years . 
  they give you shit because this guy just said `` it ** sounds ** like that '' , no need to get all worked up and be a smartass about it , i mean `` post-factual * world * '' because he thinks/supposes the situation is like that ... get a grip lol, 
  sorry pal , `` tough luck '' , i 'm neither a trumpster nor am i `` american ( serbian ? ) '' . 
  sorry that me being a german who 's tired of these crybabies whining about `` trumpsters '' and safe spaces while obviously enjoying their safe spaces a lot themselves shatters your world view . 
  go back to wherever you came from , and take this `` trumpster , drumpf , safe spaces , libtard , leftist '' mess with you . 
  that may be right , but stop acting like deaths because of terror attacks are just a part of your everyday statistics . 
  the fact that the terror attack happened at all is an outlier . 
  of course you 're gon na act all cool and `` rational '' about it , as long as it does n't affect you directly , and believe me , you wo n't `` prefer the statistic-driven approach over an emotionally loaded approach any time of the day '' when it affects you or someone you know . 
  of course it is , but that 's not my point . 
  it 's just there 's always some jackass trying to downplay somebody 's decision or opinion with `` huh , you lil irrational pussy , you are more likely to die because of a car accident right now '' . 
  sure you gon na be all cool and smug about it when you were n't affected by it directly , and nobody is gon na thank this dude when he 's telling them `` tough luck pal , it was n't really likely to happen '' . 
  how is it not relevant ? 
  it does n't matter how many have died , it became relevant the moment terrorist attacks became something `` not that unusual '' in europe . 
  when will people like you stop seeing it as a simple statistic ? 
  the moment you or somebody you love becomes part of said statistic ? 
  stop banalizing the terror attacks you dipshit . 
  i hope you lose someone in such an attack and some smug asshole is there to tell you : `` well , your mom/sibling/friend / ... was far more likely do die in a car accident , hope you feel better now '' . 
  a guy just drove his truck into a christmas market and all you do is whine about `` trumpsters '' and their fucking sub ??? 
  shut your damn mouth and get off of this thread/sub ... 
  we really need to stop downplaying this with `` i 'm so tired ( of 2016 ) , please stop , i want to get off this wild ride ... '' at this rate 2017 is going to be the same . 
  no , you do n't `` absolutely '' take a chance at 1 in 15.000 odds , do n't act like it 's common sense to do so, 
   and branding all muslims as such actively turns them into ones . 
  are you fucking serious ... 
  the nato does n't really care about genocides , they 'll bomb anyone if they ( as in the nato ) have any `` objective '' / ulterior motives . 
  let 's not act like they care about the poor people of `` insert country here '' getting oppressed by `` insert dictator here '' . 
  could you give him one proper answer or some arguments for you side instead of insulting him all the time ? 
  get off your high horse . 
  you could do that , it would n't make any sense , because comparing domestic abuse with war between two countries is ridiculous , but sure , go ahead . 
  and this is western propaganda ... we can go on and on . 
  thanks for your insight it 's hard to type this without it sounding sarcastic lol, 
  go home yank , you 're drunk . 
  looks pretty `` fertile '' to me . 
  it 's funny ( and sad , well mostly for you ) that me not being a `` gastarbeiter '' weakens all of your arguments . 
  i 'll gladly talk with you about the border dispute over the scrap of coast slovenia and croatia have , or about the tensions between romania und hungary because of transilvania . 
  that does not make me a slovenian , croatian , hungarian or romanian , it just makes me interested in history . 
  get out of your bubble and stop exposing yourself to ridicule you idiot . 
  do you even read what you are writing ? 
  now i 'm 100 % sure that you are just plain dumb . 
  first off , it 's called ** mumbo ** - jumbo `` cmon '' . 
  secondly , please tell me you 're seeing the irony in the shit you are writing :  start acting like an adult ... your whole life is a stereotype i never acted as anything else , but you on the other hand , resorting to insults and all that clever stuff ( and not even bringing up arguments to your `` shitty land '' - statement , i 'm serious , tell me why it is , you did n't even bother once in your 50 comments to explain why this would be the case ) . 
  my life 's a stereotype , interesting ... says the guy from the * balkans * badmouthing another country from the * balkans * and of course everyone who opposes your backwards views is from the other bad * balkan * countries . 
  if you asked me to write a more ironic and stereotypical comment than yours , i would n't have been able to . 
  you ca n't make this shit up . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  i 'm just surprised someone calling , not even another country per se , but the `` land '' shitty . 
  so i took one minute out of my day to see if that 's actually true . 
  but who am i arguing with , you ca n't take the balkan out of a man , even/especially if it 's a country who does n't want to be associated with it at all costs lol, 
  lol look at him having to behave now after all his comments got deleted . 
  sorry dude , sarcasm only works if you are from a relevant country that has actually achieved something , not one where 99 % of people confuse it with another country . 
  and the serbian land really is `` good '' , i figured that out after a quick 2 minute read , are you trying to tell me that you are so dumb that you ca n't do a quick read on this topic on your own , cmon man . 
  it is * now *, 
  i did a quick research and `` serbian land `` seems to be good actually , but well , what can you expect from someone who resorts immediately to calling others retards . 
  it 's merk ** e ** l,
