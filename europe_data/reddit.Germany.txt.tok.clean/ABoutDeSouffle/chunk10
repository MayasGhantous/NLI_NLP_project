  sometimes , i 'd much prefer we slipped back into the role of the sugar daddy who gets rich while others beat themselves on the chests and engage in dick waving . 
  i want germany like switzerland : envied and silent rather than like the usa : loud and controversial . 
  both are rich , so it makes no difference . 
  murrica , fuck yeah !, 
  personally , i prefer the current crop of politicians to a german putin or orban . 
  but yeah the taking europe by the balls is lacking a bit lately . 
  we should step up our game . 
  man , imagine we had won that war - everybody still alive would be ** so ** happy to have merkel ... ` \u00b0 \u00b0 `, 
  what a shame , all those nice small tits gone : /, 
  well , yes i do understand . 
  i am just laughing my ass off at the bullets homing in from all directions currently . 
  personally , i am a-ok with the `` hippie state '' accusation . 
  in a sense it is even valid - germany has frequently had bouts of idealism that turned into politics unfiltered . 
  typically , this has either puzzled or scared the neighbors . 
  and the current stance on the refugee situation is no exception , after all , we have run a real tight ship over 30 years when it comes to immigration . 
  with all due respect to hammond , someone would need to call isis to end the conflict there . 
  and they probably would n't listen . 
   the eu was by far the biggest contributor for the development of my country . 
  i blame my country 's politicians for most of our problems , from corruption to incompetence . 
  and i am very thankful for the money that the uk , germany , etc contributed with . 
  i really have a hard time understanding the problem . 
  there 's not need to be extra thankful for money , but you start off ( and repeat it ) that germany is bullying smaller countries around while at the same time acknowledging that germany and the eu at large are helping you develop . 
  yes , wage levels between countries are different and i wish they were not . 
  wages in each country are not the same for say a doctor and a carpenter , but that 's a completely different discussion - this has been so for thousands of years and we are not going to change that any time soon . 
  honestly , what would you want germany to do ( not in an idealized universe where we pay for your wages ) ? 
  schengen can be suspended , there are rules for that . 
  do n't need to abolish it . 
  but then what ? 
  another 100 calais across europe . 
   from an outer point of view , you invest in the countries , you lend money , but always in your own interest . 
  i 'd never thought i 'd see the day that investments were officially bad . 
  usually foreign direct investments are a great thing for a developing economy . 
   your companies pay less i guess that 's why a lot of people want to work for them . 
   some pay briberies you seem to forget that those have suffered heavy fines and it was 10 years ago . 
  also , since when is a country responsible for everything a company does ? 
   from an outer point of view , you invest in the countries , you lend money , but always in your own interest . 
  so we are paying the top in net transfers to other eu countries and that 's still egoistical ? 
  please tell me what your country is doing that is against its own interest to further the union . 
  nice , that 's going to take another 20 years over here . 
  same here , they are charging us through the nose for transfer payments and spit at us every time we ask them to do something that 's not completely in their interests . 
  i mean , it 's not like germany took on a huge fucking load of east europeans post-1990 or something ... 
  well , we are a [ hippie country ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k8hc3/germany_a_hippie_state_being_led_by_its_emotions/ ) , so you should n't be surprised , 
  the black thingies from the wikipedia quote are the words , it 's spelled out pretty clearly . 
   there is nothing morally responsible about enabling a brain drain of syria 's best and brightest . 
  i can see where you are coming from , and trust me , i am not altogether happy with millions on the move towards europe without a strategy on how to integrate them either . 
  however , there 's a couple of issues with paying countries like the lebanon , jordan or turkey to keep them in refugee camps . 
  [ that image ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war#/media/file:an_aerial_view_of_the_za%27atri_refugee_camp.jpg ) should tell you a lot about the education the kids in that camp are going to receive - barely any if we are lucky , extremist islamist if we are unlucky . 
  what 's going to happen to a generation that grows up in a tent city in the desert ? 
  and i am not even talking about the bleeding hearts ' concerns here - this is both a waste of human resources and a huge danger 10 + years down the road . 
  europe has a huge interest in trying to secure a future for syria 's best and brightest , because without them , the region is not going to recover for another 30 years . 
  a lost generation there is pure dynamite , if you think about the palestinians . 
  i do n't know if i am right ( i doubt anyone can claim to be certain with any sense of honesty ) , but it seems to me like they have a better chance to raise their kids to normal human beings if they come over here than there - if only because we have the resources to house them , teach them and where possible give them jobs . 
   a german dehumanized slav what ? 
  you calling us fascists again , huh ? 
  there 's no need to get all defensive and passive-aggressive now . 
  my point still stands , the whole iraq invasion was a completely moronic idea and the result was isis , even if you resort to name-calling . 
  just get me a source that refutes my claim . 
   the only good to come from this is that it likely lessened the possibility of it happening again on a similar scale . 
  amen to that . 
  * tips hat * thanks , 
  do n't take my word for it :  bakr al-baghdadi was arrested by us forces-iraq on 2 february 2004 near fallujah and detained at camp bucca detention center under his name ibrahim awad ibrahim al-badry [ 22 ] as a `` civilian internee '' until december 2004 , when he was recommended for release by a combined review and release board . 
  [ 24 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] in december 2004 , he was released as a `` low level prisoner '' . 
  [ 22 ]  a number of newspapers and cable news channels have instead stated that al-baghdadi was interned from 2005 to 2009 . 
  these reports originate from an interview with the former commander of camp bucca , colonel kenneth king , and are not substantiated by department of defense records . 
  [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] ** al-baghdadi was imprisoned at camp bucca along with other future leaders of isil . 
  ** [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abu_bakr_al-baghdadi#us_internment ) great job , guys . 
  sorry , you are right of course . 
  yeah , isis was created in an american pow-camp , so we are totally responsible for that too . 
   the only reason the iraq war did not succeed was because of tolerance addicts and anti-war jackasses undermining national will . 
  sure , it ca n't be the whole thing was a hare-brained and ham-handed operation that was doomed to fail from the get-go . 
  outside america , a lot of people even said so aloud , so it 's not even hindsight . 
  you get too self-conscious and not horny enough in older age : /, 
   germany can ignore that where the fuck is germany ignoring that ? 
  the german economy suffers from the eu sanctions , just ask heavy industry manufacturers . 
  - [ germany leads the eu on russia sanctions ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_germany_leads_the_eu_on_russia_sanctions311313 ) - [ germany 's angela merkel calls on eu to maintain sanctions pressure on russia ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-ministers-divided-over-extending-sanctions-against-russia-1426504541 ) - [ g7 summit : obama and merkel firm on russia sanctions ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33038788 ) without german intervention , there would have been no sanctions against russia in the first place , because italy and [ france ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-19/hollande-floats-russian-sanctions-relief-in-eu-split ) were not on board . 
  the funny thing is , when russia reduced gas deliveries to poland , germany stepped up to sell gas to poland . 
  but yeah , we bad . 
   poland have n't stolen any gas , russia cut the flow unilateraly , breaking the deal we had . 
  ukraine did , though . 
   mostly bribed german politicians like shroeder . 
  lol , schr\u00f6der was out of office long since then . 
  not to defend his taking up a job at north stream , but he is no longer a politician ( since 2005 ) if you guys had not dragged your feet with baltic pipe since 2001 , you 'd have a diversified gas supply by now . 
  just as we have . 
  that 's why the russians never cut gas to germany , they know exactly they better not fuck with us . 
  nice change of tune . 
  usually we are called cold , emotionless machines of oppression , or in the case of the eur debt crisis soulless sticklers to laws and principles . 
  i am really starting to feel for the us-americans - no matter what their country does or does not , they are getting the blame if things break . 
  ah , to be young and foolish again , 
   russia would n't be able to stop sending the gas through belarus , ukraine , and poland if you just ignore trade treaties then you are right . 
  i mean , we can argue simply taking the gas is all fine because russia . 
  russia could stop selling gas to you and still sell it to germany , if you simply take it it would still be theft . 
  but yeah , this kind of national jingoism is basically why north stream exists . 
  and with the upcoming nationalist government in poland , it is probably a wise move . 
  on imageboards a lot , 4chan , ylilauta , krautchan ... and also on reddit . 
   more money from germany and german meddling in internal politics , as a lot of people over here have completely lost faith in the local politicians . 
  sorry , but no . 
  i do n't think just handing over money would be a good thing , it would most likely just further corruption . 
  and germany meddling in internal politics of romania ? 
  that 's an even worse idea . 
  you 'll sort your shit out in time , i have full trust in that .
