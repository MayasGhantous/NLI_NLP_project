  strictly speaking it 's logically impossible to refute this possibility . 
  which makes it a problematic line of argument . 
  however , in the available radar data , there is no second plane , so that makes it a tad unlikely . 
   which can become a problem for europe if they do n't recognize it . 
  unfortunately , a lot of the neo-nationalist , right wing populists in europe are anti-american and russia-fanboys ( as is d. trump in the us ) . 
  of course , russia helps them with money to keep the bond strong ... 
   i do n't have a good explanation or understanding of why the long string of very thin explanations most likely to tire people into stupidity . 
  not many russians deeply believe their government is a good one . 
  they just expect to be lied to and have stopped caring . 
  serving endless variations and ever more explanations bores people and they stop caring . 
  what they want to achieve is the reflex `` meh , all sides are lying , who cares ? '', 
  of course , it also binds resources on the other side if they are trying to debunk the stories . 
  sure , with high-quality politicians like geert wilders , an exit from the eu would improve things ... 
  what ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  where did he claim we have universal peace , brotherly love and rainbow-farting unicorns everywhere ? 
  the most peaceful time can still be a time of armed conflict . 
  even if we ignore things like the hundred years ' war , modern times have been incredibly bloody in europe . 
  * compared with that * we indeed live in the most peaceful , prosperous and progressive era in human history . 
  your picture of history seems a tad myopic , to put it lightly . 
   downloading copyrighted material yeah , illegal sharing of copyrighted material , that 's breaking the eu for me . 
  and individual countries would have held up so much better in the face of us pressure . 
   also the democratic rape that was the eu constitution . 
  which was never ratified because the eussr is so undemocratic that it forbids referenda ... 
  not the millions who were killed . 
  it 's easy to gloss over them because we have had peace for 70 years . 
  because separate legislation creates more barriers than we already have with the number of different languages . 
  look up the percentage of intra-european trade now and a generation ago . 
  more than 2000 years of near-constant war . 
  you are making his point . 
  he has a point though . 
  europe has never been peaceful for longer times except since ww ii . 
  two wars have been fought since them - both outside the eu . 
  multiple dictatorships have existed , and the eu has stabilized each of those countries after the dictators were gone . 
  the salient point is that the us * has * a whole continent for themselves . 
  the best next thing europe has is the eu . 
  make that * b\u00f6tchen von bootsgesicht * . 
  it 's the new crop of nationalism in europe , right on the heel of the 2008 crisis . 
  exactly why obama reminded europe of the benefits of the eu . 
  bullshit , he would n't be the first potus - or the first politician for that matter - to see a plan or two fail . 
  does n't make him a failed president . 
  i am not denying guantanamo bay is a scandal , however from the ~ 800 original inmates , [ roughly 80 remain today ] ( http://www.closeguantanamo.org/prisoners ) . 
  so , it 's not like nothing has been done . 
  so , one regional conflict disqualifies his historic perspective ? 
  yes , let 's just throw up our arms in despair and do nothing . 
  because europe till the creation of the eu was such a happy , peaceful and democratic place , right . 
   he is hyprocritical . 
  meh , he is n't the only one who decides on us policy . 
  it 's not just lefties these days . 
  the populist right blows that exact horn - anti-americanism , anti-globalization , love for small-town europe ... 
  no , the ppp/ppi is adjusted for that . 
  they can actually buy a lot more with their wages . 
  damn , switzerland , you make us look poor . 
   why would germany want someone else to challenge their hegemony of the continent ? 
  because germany is an extremely reluctant and uneasy hegemon , what with our history and the consequences . 
  most of the current crop of politicians over here would prefer a `` primus inter pares '' situation over one where germany is an uncontested leader . 
  currently , the idea that british input is not missed here is just self-pity . 
  however , if the uk leaves and france stays weak , then over time we 'll probably see a new generation of politicians that find a german leadership in the eu a nice and convenient thing . 
  i probably was too terse in my post and too caustic , so sorry about that . 
  i am not scared of ww iii - this would start by accident only thanks to nukes and mad . 
  however , i see fairness and democracy as the guiding principle of the developed world in decline because of death by a thousand paper cuts . 
  and if people lose faith in democracy , it ai n't going to be pretty . 
  yes , / u/breaks _ it is right , `` berlin '' is shorthand for german federal government . 
  all i meant was `` i know how the political system in germany is set up , how it is structured and how it is supposed to work . 
  i still have no idea how the real power structures in my country are , meaning backroom deals , lobbyism , the military-industrial complex , the buddy network between politicians and bankers and so on '' . 
  that 's what i alluded to in [ my original comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ft2ms/swedes_tell_britain_if_you_leave_the_eu_well/d2csvik ) - i do n't think you will gain any more influence on politics due to an eventual brexit . 
  as far as i understand the british reality , the country is run by a cozy partnership between politicians and lobbyism of the different varieties as is germany or the eu . 
  could be wrong of course , what with me not living there . 
  i know - and / r/europe used to be the first site i read in the morning and my go-to subreddit barely two years ago . 
  now ? 
  it 's hard to stomach . 
  sad times . 
  it 's ok man , no worries  in fact , i am ** not ** super worried about the current migration and refugee situation . 
  germany and europe are able to take on a lot of people . 
  however , i ** am ** scared by the idea that due to a freak combination of factors ( drought , civil war ... ) a lot more people could flee africa . 
  that would not end well . 
  to see where i come from see [ that poll ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/124028/700-million-worldwide-desire-migrate-permanently.aspx ) . 
   you are telling me that you do n't care how your city is run your reading comprehension is even worse than your social skills . 
  and that 's saying something . 
  but yeah , your post starts out condescending , ends condescending and in between is lecturing . 
   secondly is this really how you want to say this : `` when in former times the people there had the decency to simply die in their homelands '' ? 
  oh boy , do i really have to use / s here ? 
  i thought it was obvious that i was piling it on thick ... 
   i hope this does n't come across as patronising that 's a joke , right ? 
  - the whole middle east is going into a tailspin like we have n't seen in any region for a long time . 
  i know shit about islam , but it seems to me that the sunni/shia divide is n't going to be resolved or pacified for the next decades . 
  and on top of that , we have the new `` ultra-fundamentalist ideology meets 20th century thinking and tech '' groups like isis that are trying to pull the region back to the middle ages . 
  - africa and especially northern africa are not doing well . 
  when in former times the people there had the decency to simply die in their homelands they now know about the west and will try to come here . 
  that 's possibly hundreds of million of people . 
  - russia is teetering on the brink of either bankruptcy or dictatorship or both . 
  that 's not good news for the world at all and bears some uneasy resemblance to germany in the 1920 's . 
  - southern america seems to be stuck in the global lower middle class without any indication it will enter into the rich club . 
  that 's especially bad for brazil which needs growth like china to keep it stable - china itself seems to be poised for big economic troubles and unable to sustain their growth . 
  - the centrifugal forces in the eu seem to overwhelm the project . 
  some cheer this on , but imo europe has never been a stable continent before the eu , so i see no compelling reason it should be stable post-eu in a time where growth is tapering off . 
  - the us is structurally and mentally incapable of dealing peacefully with a strong military force in another country which is not dominated by them . 
  there 's a looming conflict with china as it becomes more assertive . 
   the rest of the eu has a deep-seated anti-british attitude oh wow , i read this passive-aggressive stance very often from brits . 
  i do n't understand it ** at all ** .
