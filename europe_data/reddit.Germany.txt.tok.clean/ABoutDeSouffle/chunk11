   people basically want romania to be germany - money , politics etc. , just import 'em wholesale . 
  that 's of course extremely flattering and i 'd love to see you becoming wealthy and proud . 
  but we ca n't take over the country and run it for you . 
   well , fuck you too germany . 
   with all the shit talking and blackmail germans are attempting to do on poland lately you can never be overly cautious . 
  and please do n't bother telling me that this is all founded in reality and germany is the evil overlord blah blah . 
  you just behaved like a clueless rude idiot . 
  what ? 
  whoa , first shitposting , then trying to be clever about a foreign language and then getting rude to top it off . 
  nice going , mate . 
   there is no word `` wertelos '' in a dictionary which suggests it was one of the many made-on-spot words , a fine quirk of the german language . 
  true . 
   the only root the `` werte '' part could come from is still the word `` wert '' , which is is translated as `` warto\u015b\u0107 '' - worth . 
  wert = worth werte = values or virtues  as i already said , double entendre absolutely not , no . 
  you are dead wrong , the two words have a completely different meaning . 
  most likely that shitty auto-translation is making the rounds on polish facebook and he just brought it over ... 
  i mean the article is not great , but maybe people could ask for the help of a native speaker instead of damning us ... 
  then please read the article again , it was `` wert ** e ** los '' . 
  there 's an additional `` e '' there that makes a world of difference . 
  `` since thursday , poland receives additional gas through the german pipeline in mallnow , we hear . 
  in the last days , missing deliveries were topped up by germany and czech republic '' [ source back in 2014 ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/gazprom-drosselt-gaslieferungen-massiv-article13590076.html ) there again could come a time when you 'll be happy that you can hide behind germany 's broad shoulders and still receive gas instead getting anally raped by russia . 
  just saying about the solidarity thingy . 
  please do n't tell me how german works , really . 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
  personally ? 
  i think it 's an error in german politics to keep you out of schengen . 
  but the image of romanians and bulgarians is not exactly glowing over here , so i would n't hold my breath . 
  a lot of voters are scared of romanian gangs . 
  - http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2367612/invasion-pickpockets-disturbing-pictures-eastern-european-gangs-brazenly-targeting-victims-broad-daylight-paris-streets-heading-uk.html - `` on the crucial issue -- world cup qualifier , germany vs romania -- the outcome is very clear . 
  there were a total of 2,437 arrests of people from germany across those four years . 
  the number for romanians was 27,725 . 
  this latter figure included 1,370 suspected burglaries and 142 alleged rapes , by the way , just to flesh the stats out with a bit of detail . '', 
  ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/rod-liddle/9211861/id-rather-have-a-geman-next-door-too-and-i-have-the-figures-to-show-why/ ) you got an image problem in the west , and that 's what 's keeping you out of schengen . 
  unless the mods step up their game , the sub will turn into another bydlo sub like / r/worldnews . 
  you could use my [ filter plugin ] ( https://github.com/isnow/reuropefiltered ) to filter out the trash . 
  ugh , op , you did a serious mistranslation . 
  `` wertelos '' does ** not ** mean `` worthless '' , it means in that case `` without human values '' . 
  the only thing schengen facilitates is free movement of people . 
  you are already part of the free market . 
  cutting red tape and corruption would do wonders for foreign direct investments . 
  why are you on # 48 in the [ ease of doing business ranking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index#ranking ) ? 
  - germany is at # 14 and an ex-ussr state , estonia , is at # 17 . 
   it is literally a choice between 5-6000 net there or 500-700 net here . 
  when i visited ghana some years ago , people were telling me they want to come to europe because everyone there gets a car from the government . 
  that 's about the same level of delusion as believing a normal doc salary over here is 6k net . 
  of course it is a problem , but you already receive [ nearly 3 % of gdp ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/country.aspx?id=ro ) in transfer payments from the eu . 
  i do n't see what germany should do , should we order your politicians to pay a doc at least 1000 eur ? 
  or to put it another way , not every problem in europe is germany 's problem . 
  or are you seriously expecting germany to top up all wages in the east to german levels ? 
  what do you even want from us , more meddling in your internal politics or less or simply money , no questions asked ? 
   eu army / nato , safe-zones , kill isis the last time the burgers tried something like that , isis was born . 
  bombing the shit out of the middle east has never solved any problem there . 
   there are at least some problems which are unsolvable without fiscal redistribution , and one is the heath-care systems in romania and bulgaria . 
  i really do n't see why germany has to pay for the health care systems in other countries . 
  at some point , you are the masters of your own destiny - and you fix the problems yourself . 
   germany bought more gas from russia than any other european country in 2013 no shit , sherlock . 
  germany has the largest gas demand by far , so it would be the largest purchaser in a lot of countries . 
  what 's more , german companies like basf wintershall are large-scale brokers who resell the stuff - so a lot of gas from north stream is ending up in other countries . 
   germany is opposed to fiscal redistribution but here 's the thing . 
  if you wanted to build the eu , if you wanted to take us in , you need at least 1 of 2 things . 
  either you establish fiscal redistribution as a federal state would have , or you relocate more of your industry to other parts of europe . 
  what you ca n't do is you ca n't keep the industry , as well as the new workers you get from eastern europe as well as all the wealth they produce . 
  what the hell man ? 
  germany has since 20 years transitioned to an industrial model that is heavily dependent on outsourcing to eastern europe . 
  go ask in sibiu :  there are 20,300 companies with german subscribed share capital ( worth eur 4.44 billion as of the end of april 2014 ) registered with the romanian national trade register office . 
  adjusted figures put the number actually active in the romanian market at around 8,000 . 
   german direct investment in romania was 6.5 bn in 2012 . 
  [ source ] ( http://rumaenien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_rumaenien/publicatii/presse/2013/german_investments._diplomat.pdf ) . 
  that 's over 4 % of gdp in investments from germany alone . 
   since 2007 , slovakia has been the world 's largest producer of cars per capita , [ 1 ] with a total of 571,071 cars manufactured in the 2007 alone in a country with 5 million people [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automotive_industry_in_slovakia ) . 
  guess why this is ? 
  clue : foreign companies , especially from germany and france . 
   in terms of both the number of investors and the total amount invested , german companies rank first among foreign direct investors in poland . 
  in 2012 alone , german direct investments there totaled eur 3.5 billion , aggregate investment since poland 's change of political system in 1989/1990 amounting to eur 27 billion . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/laender/laenderinfos/01-nodes/polen_node.html ) where the hell are we keeping our industry to ourselves ? 
  and maybe that 's too blunt , but we also employ 250k bulgarians and romanians over here who send back money home . 
  and we are not shy of paying up : since the mid-70 's we [ paid roughly 340bn ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/year.aspx?year=0&amp;month=0 ) more than we took , so gim me a break with the constant ` gibe monies , gibe plox ` . 
  ladies and gentlemen , the queen !, 
  how is it double standards if i point out that you are in the situation like every other medium-wealth country in the world ? 
  you and you alone are responsible for paying your medical personnel , if you choose to pay them poverty wages , it 's your own fault . 
  germany already employs  250 000 workers from romania and bulgaria , if we take on more , everyone will start bitching we are bleeding the countries dry . 
  and yes , germany already pays a lot in eu transfers . 
  i do n't see why we have to pay direct subsidies to eastern european health systems . 
  and what would schengen do for your wages ? 
  that will come , yes . 
   while germany has relatively low reserves to survive any crisis wait , we have a solid year in reserves and pipelines to every european producer . 
  we can use the rotterdam lng terminal if shit hits the fan . 
   and those countries in their museums have both ** dinosaurs and mammoths ** that were n't dug out in their own lands . 
  no , they stole all of that , they liked it and they killed for it . 
  now the people are going back after their stolen fortunes . 
  solid argument . 
  the prehistoric wooly mammoth fauna of the middle east and africa was world-special . 
  yes , you crossed into paranoia with the puppet idea . 
  sure germany has a lot of influence , but that 's the point every sane person would go back to reading on how the eu does politics . 
   come here , study medicine for 6 years then earn that for another 3-5 years , and then if you 're ok with that , i 'll be ok with imposed refugee quotas . 
  deal ? 
  what the hell , then move to germany and work there , we are not responsible if your country is incapable or unwilling to pay decent wages for docs . 
  refugees are not a hobby of germany . 
  you get even paid for taking them on even though each country has a fucking obligation to offer asylum . 
  all you seem to be able is sit on your ass and breed resentment .
