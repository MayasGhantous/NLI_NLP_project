  it 's strange , whenever i am in poland , i meet terrific people . 
  but i ca n't say i quite understand your choice in politicians . 
  but that 's probably the same the other way around ... 
  it 's not like it was a present to you , 
   poland a few years ago , maybe , but they 've since toned down the rhetoric . 
  wait for the next election and they 'll go full potato again . 
   recently the german media is outright hostile to austria what ? 
  well , give them back their clay ... 
  i never quite understand what is going on between macedonia and greece . 
  it ca n't be just the name and obviously macedonia is not a military threat . 
  so what gives ? 
  no , we are the exception , we think it 's more important to be feared , 
  nothing , but you very verbally do n't like us , so ... 
  little brother needs some tough love from time to time . 
  when dad caught us genociding , he put all the blame on us and got away with it . 
  he was playing the fool , the `` interesting that hitler came from there though '' is the giveaway . 
  germany fav neighbor : france i do n't really have a least favorite neighboring country . 
  they are all democratic countries and usually do n't behave like dicks towards us . 
  if i had to pick , austria because they gave us hitler . 
   ok , you can call me a n. ... nah , you would n't call me that . 
  i have no idea what your skin color is , so no . 
  so you have a crystal ball ? 
  you are talking out of your ass , mate . 
  no , the original energy saving bulbs where the sodium-vapor lamps used in the east . 
  west berlin used fluorescent lighting ( white ) . 
  that 's easy to say about christianity * after * it got declawed by reformation and religious wars and enlightening . 
  renouncing the bible would have been a ticket to an autodafee for quite some time . 
  ** all ** abrahamic are originally murderous when challenged , judaism and christianity simply had to transform . 
  i have no doubt islam will as well , but it wo n't be in my lifetime , unfortunately . 
  remove p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt ? 
  so let me translate one of their theses for you :  we however propose an islam , which clearly and without ambiguity , without if or when confesses itself to the democratic values of our society . 
  we propose an islam which , without if or whens , backs human rights as the universal norms that are valid for all humans . 
  still not impressed ? 
  it used to be like that in the west till the 1970s too . 
  and we see a resurgence of women in it/cs , good thing . 
  it does , in informal ways . 
  there it [ this institutionalized dialog ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_islamkonferenz ) between moderate muslim organizations and german politicians . 
  no doubt this forum will be asked to participate sooner or later . 
   qur ` an is literally the word of god coming to muhammad through gabriel . 
  hum , the same was true about the bible for centuries . 
  it took several hundred years for christian authorities to first allow and then embrace exegesis . 
  that 's why they are dead , right ? 
  luther was n't killed for his blasphemous theses . 
   has been making only enemies that 's completely demented . 
  no , the yellow lighting is in the east . 
  oh wow , trp is leaking . 
   elsesser cites examples of men who have been dragged in by their hr departments for simply opening a door for a female colleague or complimenting her on a new suit . 
  ca n't really comment on the situation in the usa , but that sounds like a load of hogwash . 
  i work in a really huge international company and there are compliments given and taken , no problem . 
  and yes , we have a anti-harrassment policy . 
  i bet that were isolated cases where something else had been brewing for some time . 
  they are free , so they attract a lot of people who could n't pay for university in other countries . 
  that 's great of course , but also leads to long waiting lists . 
  otoh if you make it , you wo n't have to start into your working life with six-digit debt . 
  oh yeah , one of the few times in my life where i was completely sure i was witnessing history in the making . 
  kind of feels like it was just a couple of years ago standing on the wall and toasting people i had never seen . 
  i am old . 
  i probably speak like german soldiers in ww ii flicks ... 
  our fucking neo-nazis meanwhile tell everyone there never was a gas chamber in any kz on true german soil and that 's proof enough the poles were behind auschwitz . 
  i wish i was joking ... 
  well , yes globally . 
  but if you read the descriptions of the industrial hot-spots of the time , things look a bit different . 
  human impact on the environment was more localized , but extremely severe . 
  the author is confusing the early 20th century with the early middle ages ( and even then , mining areas were not healthy ) . 
   the world was clean , and human impact on the environment and our own health was minimal . 
  what was this guy smoking ? 
  how old are you , granny ? 
  what i learned just the other day  homosexuality was never illegal under polish law , and poland was one of the first countries to avoid punishing homosexuality in early modern era . 
  this was formally codified in 1932 , and poland introduced an equal age of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals , which was set at 15 . 
  ( wikipedia ) i had no idea how awesome good guy poland was . 
  of course not . 
  i would n't bet 1000 eur on something i believe could happen . 
  thanks , 
  and i thought that was about peace talks . 
  since none of those countries with the exception of turkey take in syrian refugees , european powers should be at the table to try to prevent great game-like shit . 
  or realism , because i live here and know the country and you do n't . 
   and it seems that ** everybody in government ** knew about that you base that on ... what ? 
  i mean it is bad enough that one of germany 's premier companies is morally bankrupt enough to deceive , but there 's no reason for hyperbole . 
   germany is never quite what it seems . 
  there is a strain between its order and its urges . 
  formality may mask frenzy . 
  when things go wrong , they tend to go wrong in a big way . 
  ahhhh , that sent comfortable shivers down my spine . 
  we have this dark , dark soul that will tear the world again down the abyss , soon enough !, 
  nietzsche would be sooo proud . 
  lol ny times is really trying to wreck germany and no matter what happens over here , it 's always the thinly veiled excuse to evoke some hitlering . 
  i never said anything about songs and roses , but those are isolated clashes . 
  wake me up if [ something like that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_england_riots ) happens over here , then i start to worry . 
  i still ca n't stop laughing about describing one of the more dynamic societies in europe as `` decaying '' . 
  that 's just so far out ... 
  so because my ancestors did shitty things , it is not pc to call romanians out for treating minorities bad in current times ? 
  nice logic , i love it when the nazi card is played like that . 
  sure , you are a model of how to treat minorities . 
  pot , kettle and all that . 
  it became a default sub and that invariably leads to a decline in quality ( there , i said it ) . 
  even before , the good-natured posts ( `` look at the beautiful images i took in poland '' , `` what 's your favorite country in europe ? '' ), 
  had declined and the sub had become very politicized . 
  and it 's a really bad streak for the eu - it has fulfilled its primary objective , uniting a peaceful europe and fostering prosperity and the additional missions are much more demanding . 
  the rise of populist and nationalist parties all over europe did major damage and has sown doubt and prejudice - and exactly those guys with their lack of discussion culture have now landed here .
