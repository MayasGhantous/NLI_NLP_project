  by providing better child care to parents , to pay people for raising children and maybe even technological breakthroughs that allow people to have children even later or have more robotic household helpers that are able to change diapers and take babies for a stroll . 
  i am sure reproduction rates would recover if everyone had to work just 30h/w . 
  there 's indeed a change in reproductive behavior in germany among the native population - it 's small , but the number of children per woman is increasing . 
  could be that better support for families has something to do with it . 
  population will still decline because the number of kids/woman is still way below the required 2.1, 
  first , i did n't do that . 
  second , go ahead , tell me more about my country , why do n't you ? 
  kudos for changing your view on things , that 's rare , 
   the former chief economist of the world bank said europe and the united states had similar economies , resources and labor pools , but the u.s. economy had recovered from the global financial crisis while the european economy had not . 
   `` the big difference is the euro , '' he said lord help us . 
  stiglitz is turning even more simplistic . 
  sure , the euro is ** the ** big difference , if we ignore - that the usa is * one * country , whereas the eu is 27.5 countries . 
  - that demographics are different , what with the usa having a [ median age of 36.8 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_the_united_states ) vs. the [ eu 's 42.4 years ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/population_structure_and_ageing ), 
  the eu is not the same as the eurozone . 
  and this is all due to the eu ? 
  just look at the top 10 countries in the [ post from / u/fluchtpunkt ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/564k4n/record_rise_in_babies_with_foreign_mothers_in/d8g90zc ) . 
  syrians make up 0.6 % of babies born , afghans do n't even make it to the top 10 countries . 
  the full list from destatis lists at least 31,000 babies to eu citizens of some listed eu countries and 48384 to `` other european countries '' , among them more eu countries and russia . 
  asia is 25,000 , africa 13,500 , america 4,400 . 
  turkey is 21500 , down 2 % from 2014 and 1 % from 2013 . 
  yes you do , because the absolute vast majority of migrants here is intra-eu migrants and russians and you still are harping on about how hostile muslims are going to destroy germany . 
   i very well understand that not all of them are of muslim background , but that is still a very large number . 
   because it skews with the social composition of the country . 
  contrary to what people seem to believe , the composition of a society is not stable without migration , it is continually in flux ( in germany 's case because of a low birthrate , pushing up the average age ) . 
  intra-eu migration is one of the four freedoms that are the base of the eu , so it is basically a right of the people and i see nothing wrong with it . 
  for god 's sake , try to get the image out of your head that german cities are invaded by hordes of blacks and muslims . 
  that 's totally not the reality here . 
  throw out the polish parents because they are an invasion army ? 
  you understand the largest group of babies born to foreign mothers is to eu mothers , right ? 
  so , why does this threaten us and what 's it got to do with hitler ? 
   you sure what you 're doing , germany ? 
  just calm down . 
  that 's ** migrants ** , not just refugees . 
  there were like 740,000 babies born and of those 4,800 syrians - 0.6 % . 
  more than twice as many were born to polish women - you really think their central/eastern european cultural background predisposes them for toppling our proud german values and go full jihad on us ? 
  why is everyone completely losing their shit when it comes to migration ? 
  absolutely not , those failed tanker deal is proof that the military-industrial complex can and will stop those attempts . 
  so , yeah , airbus can bid , but they ca n't win . 
  post-9 / 11 , protection from overbearing surveillance has been eroded . 
  sex and porn laws have been tightened . 
  even basic human rights like freedom from torture and right to a fair trial are in jeopardy . 
  so , no , it 's not just immigration . 
  none of those are made by airbus though . 
  there 's no way the u.s. military would buy from airbus . 
  seems like the times of liberal democracy are ending , left , right , and center . 
  it 's not just russia anymore . 
  did they even sell one plane there yet ? 
  oh , silly me - i thought we were talking about a stamp ca . 
  let me check , yep , we were . 
  and it still means what it meant back then . 
  yes it does . 
  back then , more than now , `` england '' was shorthand for britain in germany . 
  like nostradamus . 
  `` first victims '' of their own guy . 
  that stamp is from around 1914 . 
  it 's sad to see a comment about germany hating others is so much upvoted on our national celebration . 
  it actually means `` may god punish britain '' . 
   even a broken clock is right once every day . 
  see , even a broken clock is more accurate than zerohedge , 
  most of the bank bailout money went to greek banks to prevent a systemic meltdown of the greek banking system . 
  zerohedge is the most bullshit financial site there is . 
  they have been forecasting the fall of germany 's economy for a lot of times . 
  they have zero inside information , their only reliable source is their own ass . 
  they know this . 
  this catches them on the wrong foot however , because they just in the case of the italian banca monte dei paschi have stressed that taxpayer-financed bail-outs are n't allowed any more . 
  so , if they now rescue db , the shit-storm would be epic , both domestically ( people here hate bankers with a vengeance ) and among emu peers . 
  so , the denial now and the hope db somehow gets its act together . 
  if worst comes to worst , i guess the german state will take over db regardless because an uncontrolled collapse would sink the emu economy . 
  i just hope they take the chance to split up db into a investment bank and a customer bank . 
   what could happen is < whatever_amount_judge_decides  of russian assets in europe could be seized and money distributed among families of victims . 
  i am not sure this is possible in a european jurisdiction . 
  in the us , it might work . 
   crimea will be returned do n't hold your breath . 
  while i do n't support russia 's land-grab at all , i do n't think the majority of crimeans want back to ukraine . 
  unless the russian regime collapses in the next few years , crimea is gone . 
  but still , the us denied the allegations at first as well , they never apologized for shooting down that airliner and the soldiers responsible were not punished but received medals . 
  that was pretty much a shit show of its own - even if it was handled somewhat better than what the russians or the soviets are doing . 
  it 's a bit of a lengthy thing . 
  there 's a kernel of truth in it , which makes it difficult to correct . 
  tl ; dr : both sides did not provide full radar data , but while the ukrainians have given a valid reason , russia has not . 
  all quotes are from [ the 2015 report ] ( https://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/uploads/phase-docs/1006/debcd724fe7breport-mh17-crash.pdf ) . 
  i give chapter numbers , my comments in ** bold ** . 
  read the tl ; dr first , then my comments , then the quotes from the report and on a rainy day , read the report , it 's really a good read if you are into sleuthing . 
  2.9.5.1 ground-based data sources were available and obtained for the investigation . 
  recorded data from ukrainian and russian federation radar stations was provided to the dutch safety board * primary radar : * a system that emits a series of radio waves in pulses that are reflected off moving targets . 
  target position and speed are determined by comparison of the transmitted and the reflected radio waves . 
  * secondary surveillance radar : * a radar system that interrogates a transponder carried in an aircraft to provide the air traffic controllers with information such as aircraft type , position , altitude , flight number and destination . 
  this is known as mode s surveillance data from the radar systems of both ukraine and the russian federation was requested for the investigation . 
  the data requested for the investigation was as follows : type | ukraine | russian federation -- | -- | -- primary radar data - raw data | not available | not available | primary radar data - processed data | not available | not available | secondary surveillance radar data - raw data | available | not available | secondary surveillance radar data - processed data | available | not available | ads-b data | available | not available | other data made available | video film of radar screen secondary data | video film of radar screen showing processed primary and secondary data ** here you can see that ukraine indeed did not provide primary radar raw data , which is a big point in the russian narrative . 
  they keep conveniently forgetting that their own country also did not provide this data ** 2.9.5.2 the ukrainian civil primary radar stations in the area were not functioning at the time of the crash due to scheduled maintenance . 
  the military primary radar stations were also not operational . 
  the ukrainian ministry of defence stated that this system was not operational , because there were no ukrainian military aircraft in the sector through which flight mh17 flew . 
  the combined primary radar and secondary surveillance radar data from the russian federation 's air navigation service provider , gkovd , was provided in the form of a video containing a radar screen replay . 
  no other data was received . 
  ** ooops , so the ukrainians did n't provide primary radar data either from civil or military radar installations . 
  but they did provide both recorded videos from secondary radar and raw data from the same installation , allowing the investigators to cross check for manipulation . 
  provided just a video and no means of verifying it ** in general , the video replay of the russian federation 's combined primary and secondary radar data was consistent with the ukrainian radar data . 
  regarding other aeroplanes in the vicinity , the surveillance data showed that three other aeroplanes flew through the same sector as flight mh17 at around the time of the crash , see figure 7 . 
  these three aeroplanes were operating flights for air india 9 ( flight aic113 ) , eva air ( flight eva88 ) and singapore airlines ( flight sin351 ) . 
  two of these flights were cruising eastbound and one flight was cruising westbound .
