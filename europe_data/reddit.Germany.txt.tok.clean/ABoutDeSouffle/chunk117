  since qe results in lower interest , that should drive inflation , but that also has more or less failed ( partly due to lower oil prices , but also because people think the future will hold another crisis and therefore rather save instead of blowing the money on consumption ) . 
   northern europe is n't going to change its approach , as it has the strongest hand . 
  you seem to forget that the ecb has switched to external devaluation through qe . 
   kosice lunik 9 what the hell is that place ? 
  district heating . 
  one of the few things communism got right . 
  do you think we are resting on our laurels and just euthanizing people ? 
  there might be cure , one day . 
  but if that day is 50 years from now , that 's not going to help her . 
  actually , their soe 's are complete shit and dragging the economy down . 
  they are mostly more successful because they have the world 's highest headcount and opened their economy over a 25 year span unlike eastern europe . 
   we had many industrial plants and enterprises which could compete with western european counerparts after modernisation , we could still produce own passager cars , own computers and electronics sorry , but that 's just bullshit . 
  comecon computers and electronics were thoroughly uncompetitive and car designs were either licensed from western companies or 10 years behind the times . 
  militarily , the uk was a major actor too . 
  capability is n't all , you need the will to play with others as well . 
  well , you do n't accept anything burdensome from core europe , so get fucked and play with your v4 pals .

  most of our school shootings were done with perfectly legal weapons , so wipe that smirk . 
  also , your rate of firearms related deaths [ is 3x ours ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate ) , so that works really well for you . 
   german rifle association , an organization that is trying to keep the current gun laws in europe . 
  according to their site they want relaxed gun laws and armed citizens . 
  because that shit works so well in the usa . 
   4 offending countries and only 2 see the possibility of sanctions being raised and formally discussed by the european comission but there were no sanctions . 
  you really want to be offended about the eu , right ? 
   the comission never , ever discussed sanctions on germany 's superavit you seem to forget that around the turn of the century , germany was violating the 3 % deficit rule like your country does now . 
  the commission started an excessive deficit procedure and wanted france and germany punished for that , but the european council tried to sweep it under the rug . 
   on 25 november 2003 , the council chose not to accept the commission 's recommendations , which would have taken the two countries a step further towards the ultimate sanction of fine as set out in the excessive deficit procedure the affair went to the european court for justice which promptly allowed the commission to go ahead  commission president romano prodi welcomed the ruling saying that `` it confirms the central role of the stability and growth pact regulations in the european budgetary surveillance process . '' in the end , the deficit procedure went through and germany reacted with austerity at home and brought expenses under control .

   it has no ability to tell you what it is you 've detected and know range to . 
  uhm , we do n't live in the 1940 's anymore . 
  with signal-processing chips , it is perfectly possible to [ identify planes from their radar characteristics ] ( http://www.cso.nato.int/activity_meta.asp?act=2062 ) :  especially in air-defence the high speed and potential of aerial platforms requires fast reaction at maximum weapons range . 
  this means that the target must be recognized quickly and reliably . 
  the most reliable technology for identifying aircraft without relying on cooperative systems or other aircraft emissions is based on radar . 
  several studies have been performed to investigate the potential of different techniques for non-cooperative air target identification ( ncti ) where the focus has been on manned aircraft . 
  especially jet engine intakes [ provide valuable identification data ] ( https://www.cso.nato.int/activity_meta.asp?act=1641 )  over the years numerous studies have been performed on the analysis of jet engine inlets and their components . 
  [ ... ] in view of the importance of this topic for non-cooperative target identification ( ncti ) , a specific task group was formed in 2004 , namely set-085 / rtg49/rft on `` radar signature prediction of cavities on aircraft , vehicles and ships '' . 
  the group has already been granted a one-year extension , and will be finishing its works in december 2007 . 
  participating nations are deu , esp , fra , gbr , grc ( chair ) , swe and tur , whereas close co-operation was carried out with can so far the group has successfully met the great majority of its objectives , as described in the original program of work ( pow ) . 
  really , i think you need to calm a bit . 
  there had been discussions about sanctions against france , there had been discussions about penalties against germany as well . 
  nothing has happened to neither portugal or france or germany . 
   considering her warm relationship with putin beforehand lol what ? 
  merkel never had warm relationship with macho guys , she routinely emasculated any of those in her own party . 
  putin even brought his dog to meeting knowing she is afraid of and hates dogs . 
  now , schr\u00f6der and putin were pals , but merkel ? 
  forget it . 
   sure we should be fined but so should france . 
  huh , last time i looked it up , you were n't fined either ? 
   we have an insidious plan to control europe , by letting europe control us . 
  the plan is working brilliantly , things have never been so much under control . 
  pfff , everyone was complaining when we invaded them , now they are complaining again ? 
  will the complaining never end ? 
  seriously though : it 's sad that our government is not able to use the advantage it enjoys to rule europe with soft power like the us rules half the world . 
  those pesky yanks have perfected the art of helping out allies and smiling in a way that makes me envious . 
  that 's not totally true , the [ etcs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_train_control_system ) signalling standard was developed in europe and even the chinese use a knock-off called ctcs . 
  they also ordered european trains on their high speed network . 
  europe has at least three companies building bullet trains : - alsthom ( tgv ) - siemens ( ice/velaro ) - talgo ( for ave ) and what is now hitachi 's european operation . 
  china is just so vast that they made it a priority to develop their own class of fast trains - and distances are so much greater that they need much faster trains than europe . 
  it 's a shame , actually . 
  the sncf personnel on the route paris -  germany is poking fun at us when they cross the border and have to slow down . 
  germany is the country of car makers and it shows . 
  additionally , federal states have a say where trains have to stop , so they insist on stops for high speed trains in small towns . 
  that decreases the max possible speed quite a lot since it does n't make sense to build routes for 300 + km/h if the trains have to stop every 30min . 
  the next generation of our ice high-speed trains will be actually slower than the current generation because they wo n't reach the 320 + km/h of the ice-3 anywhere in germany . 
  to make things worse , train stations are in the city center whereas in france , they build stops for high speed trains outside and have local trains carry passengers to the cities , enabling them to build much straighter tracks . 
  at least they are now upgrading the track from berlin to munich , it used to be that old that you had a very scenic view of the hills of southern saxony and northern bavaria as the trains ran there with 80km/h . 
  it is really [ that straight ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:rzd_sapsan.svg ) . 
  it 's a new line build specifically for the siemens [ sapsan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sapsan ) . 
  according to wikipedia , it is an elint plane , which is just a nicer name for spy plane . 
  i do n't think they do , they typically just fly into nato country 's air defense identification zone . 
   one of the major points of such flights is to put economic strain on the opponent , forcing him to scramble his aircraft . 
  i guess that is true ( and i know russia plays the same game with nato countries ) , but i never quite understood why the country being tested has to alarm-start their fighters to shadow the intruder . 
  why not just light up a fire-control radar and track the intruder ? 
  if they are testing you , they wo n't fly into your airspace and if they do , pull a turkey on them . 
  the message a anti-aircraft targeting radar sends is clear enough . 
  secretly , i suspect it 's simply a gentleman 's agreement between air forces on both sides : you fly close to our air space once in a while so our jocks get a chance to fly intercept missions and we do the same so your aces do n't get bored . 
  that 's the first i hear and i doubt it . 
  for a more likely explanation , consider the date of our next federal election . 
  the time for pre-election gifts is now . 
  i do n't really know either , but i 'd guess that the increased competition from china , brazil or the usa has something to do with it as well . 
  globalization and cheap mass transport of goods have upped the bar in the west . 
  germany had a decade of shrinking real wages to stay competitive because around the turn of the century , we had a really high unemployment rate . 
   even hardcore sch\u00e4uble sees the need to put more money into people pockets , but this will lag in uncertainty [ idk , really ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/wage-growth ), 
  i know and i do n't care . 
  we should n't be taking in more refugees than we can house and feed , but we should n't stare at the bottom line either . 
  refugees are n't here to secure our pensions or increase our wealth , but because it 's the humane thing to do . 
  germany currently is filthy rich , it does n't hurt us if we throw out money do people do n't have to die . 
  and in the end , costs for housing and food stimulate the economy , so it 's not all wasted . 
  i 'd wager the bet that letting people keep more of their wages would depress the birth rate even more , at least it seems there 's a negative correlation between standard of living and birth rate - internationally as well as historically . 
  but it could be spent on helping parents with jobs in organizing their lives . 
  or just free beer for all ... and yeah , i am very torn on this . 
  the state neglecting the infrastructure and companies taking the money to invest in asia is n't great . 
  otoh , in 10-15 years time , the balance will start to turn due to more retired people and less wage earners , so it 's probably prudent to reduce debt before the gdp stagnates or contracts ( see japan ) . 
  at any rate , i just wanted to point out there are * massive * increases in spending and the imf seems completely oblivious , which is more than just strange . 
  but we have the eu now , 
   the refugee crisis already put a big dent in the budget uhm , no ? 
  the government ca n't even spend the whole money allotted for refugees this year and even net money flow to social security has been rising , which is completely unexpected considering the number of refugees . 
   arguing the country should use its considerable fiscal space to fund infrastructure rather than racking up bumper savings germany is [ upping spending ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/warum-schaeubles-haushalt-ein-letztes-friedensangebot-war-a-1111123.html ) for housing and related infrastructure by ** 20 % ** and streets , railways and other infrastructure by 9.2 % . 
  there is an upper limit to what a national economy can stomach in additional projects , and i think it is concerning if the imf of all institutions does either disregard this or does n't know it .
