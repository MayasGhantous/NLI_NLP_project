   germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most protestant and catholic states located within central and eastern europe . 
  kaliningrad oblast could be given back to germany . 
  the book uses the term a `` moscow-berlin axis '' ' , ? 
  ah , til , thanks . 
  polanball education is best education . 
  yeah , i was like `` what did we do * now * ? '' . 
  seems a bit tough just for what merkel did . 
  you guys really have an unhealthy fixation on war over tea . 
  i do n't see why . 
  contrary to what you say , apple is not getting punished . 
  they cut a deal that was most likely against eu law , so ireland maybe should get fined , but apple has to pay what it would have had to pay without this deal . 
  companies receiving illegal state aid have to pay up , there is nothing new or special about this case , in fact there is lots of precedent : - http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20141002/business-news/eu-regulators-order-belgian-german-airports-to-pay-back-illegal-aid.538112 - http://archyworldys.com/electricity-rebates-for-large-companies-german-green-electricity-discounts-were-illegal-aid/ - http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-orders-spanish-soccer-clubs-to-pay-back-illegal-tax-breaks-1467627935 - http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052702303653004579209803414432462, 
  looking at molenbeek , i do n't see anything wrong with it * this time * . 
  apple is not getting fined 13bn , it 's only back taxes . 
  sure , but that 's an existing , one-of-it 's - kind plane that probably gets exception from certification . 
  a series production is different . 
  it 's a great idea , but a 3-weeks course is not going to achieve much . 
  so , like the chinese still produce tsingtao beer , we could make them bake real bread and build real houses ? 
  great idea !, 
  our best exports like beer and sausage are * haram * , unfortunately . 
  obviously , syria will break up . 
  with any bad luck , it will turn into an even worse mess and there will be constant war for decades . 
  but maybe things cool down after each religious group gets their own country . 
  you are n't completely wrong , but can you really see a fiscal union coming ? 
  either such a union would be based on unlimited transfers ( which german voters would never accept ) or on very tight rules and oversight over national budgets ( which voters in no country would accept ) . 
  same for a political union . 
  i just ca n't see the irish to say ok to be governed from berlin/strasbourg/bruxelles . 
  or anyone else . 
  half-assed stop-gap measures at this point are probably better than a grand plan like the eu constitution that will get rejected at the polls . 
  but jury-rigging a political or fiscal union would be an even worse nightmare than the emu we have . 
  according to your link , they dissolved the antonov holding group because the three member companies have somehow left it . 
  the profitable antonov company ( ie . 
  not the holding group ) would be transferred to the ukraisomethingboron . 
  i believe it when i see it . 
  they would have a hell of a problem getting this old plane design certified all over the world . 
  probably , they have retained not all of the blueprints and most tooling would be gone too . 
  sounds like a publicity stunt to prepare the ukrainian population for the sale of antonov , the company , to chinese investors . 
  politico [ does agree ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-economic-progress-unemployment-viktor-orban/ ) with what you say . 
  afaik , apple has been paying the 12.5 % for two years now , the ruling is about the years before that . 
  well , the `` buy american act '' [ comes to mind ] ( http://trade.djaghe.com/?p=2650 ) , and has been [ a major stumbling block ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/5-things-to-watch-on-ttip-eu-us-trade-european-commission/ ) . 
  do n't get your hopes up . 
  he 's throwing this out now to raise the chances it gets wrecked . 
  the voters of the center/left spd absolutely hate ttip by now , and basically you ca n't win an election if you are a staunch ttip supporter . 
  i know they do n't do things by halves in the balkans , but is n't that a bit over the top ? 
  ... gloom and doom , any day now !, 
   germany has a balanced trade with the eu countries . 
  with the emu countries . 
   it cant possibly be the fact that german salaries still lag behind productivity i do n't think that 's true . 
  real unit labor costs are rising in germany , in fact , labor costs in germany [ have been rising faster ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/euro-area-labour-costs.png?s=euroarealabcos&amp;v=201607041740n&amp;url2=/germany/labour-costs ) than the emu average for a couple of years now, 
   i would bet money on the fact that virtually none of these people would have died if we didnt allow them to come to europe . 
  considering the war has cost a couple hundred thousand their lives , you 'd be be poorer by now . 
   by breaking the trade surplus rule , something that deeply hurts the eurozone as a whole no , it does n't . 
  trade surplus with the other emu countries [ is very small ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/balance-of-trade ) :  goods to the value of eur 38.9 billion ( +0.1 percent ) were dispatched to the euro area countries while the value of the goods received from those countries was eur 38.0 billion ( +3.0 percent ) . 
  while globally , the german trade surplus indeed * is a major problem * , it is [ not one that threatens the eurozone ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/raoulruparel/2015/07/22/bernanke-german-trade-surplus/ ) . 
  if you are looking for a scapegoat for the surplus against the rest of the world , you might want to look at the ecb - the institution that systematically undervalues the eur through qe . 
  exactly , it is not treason . 
  obviously , you do n't know what treason means . 
  but why would an occupied netherlands use zloty ? 
  what kind of w\u00f6rk are you going to do on a beach other than digging holes and building sand castles ? 
   says the german . 
  you 're only lucky that harry dexter 's plan was n't continued after 1949-1953 , otherwise , you would 've herded flocks of sheep at this very moment . 
  yeah , so what 's that got to do with me ? 
  i was n't alive back then , i did n't fight in ww ii . 
  are you trying to shut me up because hitler ? 
  is that central/eastern freedom of expression ? 
  i am not suprised . 
   yet , to us , we had to strip ours just to please a bunch of hypocrites . 
  you voted for capitalism in 1989 + + , you got the freedom to travel but it also meant sudden death for the socialist industry . 
  everyone in the west could see that coming , especially since people in the cee countries started to buy western goods the moment they were available . 
  the difference is that it people work for and make good money with companies from western europe . 
  doc 's have to work for local people . 
   if the east gets back on its own feet , ever , without relying on foreign-owned bussinesses in a globalized world , that 's close to impossible . 
  and with your state of mind , you may as well forget about it . 
  to be competitive , you need all the talent you can get - home grown , migrants , returning expats ... 
  or their stats just add up . 
  damn , sweden , what 's going on ? 
   i used to call hungarian dumb conspiracy theorist . 
  yeah right . 
  one needs only read back in your posting history to see you are a tin-foil hatter of the highest order . 
  either [ this ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-21/greece-s-creditors-agree-to-forgive-more-than-half-debt ) and op is off a couple of years or the debt relief the imf wanted . 
  idk , reza pahlevi was not really different from erdogan , overinflated ego and all that . 
  he 's right . 
  please , america , give them what they want or they 'll cause a collosal headache . 
  in germany , anti-muslim groups mostly come from the east where there are hardly any muslims . 
  the more people live in proximity to muslims , the more relaxed they are . 
  furthermore : the continent fought wars for centuries period . 
  for a lot of shitty reasons . 
  is n't it a bit early for an october surprise ? 
   having a bigger country as a negotiating partner would probably help our bargaining position . 
  or not , if your bargaining position is relatively eu-friendly and your strategy based on give and take . 
  admitting the one country that tried to block a lot of eu legislation and opted out of a whole lot too into efta is a surefire way to paralyze that organization . 
  and with the beef between the uk and the eu , you are just collateral . 
  great way to get your watering hole poisoned . 
  so , that 's how swedish nasheed sound ? 
  not bad !, 
  i am guessing , but i 'd say germany had most austerity in the 2003 - 2010 time frame . 
  after that , the economy was doing quite well and with the demographic contraction starting , unemployment fell and wages rose . 
  inflation has been very low , so real wages rose as well . 
  germany has an instrument called kurzarbeit where companies can cut working hours instead of firing people and the state makes the income shortfall up to a degree . 
  that was invoked by a lot of companies in 2008 .
