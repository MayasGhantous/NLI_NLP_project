  so the 500 you get from the eu make up 90 % of what is needed and is still a `` laughable sum '' . 
  i swear the eastern european greed never fails to amaze me . 
   and none of these `` war refugees '' would want to come here and work for a starting salary of 300-350 euro / month . 
  which would translate into a much higher salary in germany , because ppp which you not even seem to understand . 
  driving out the banater schwaben and siebenb\u00fcrgen was not so smart , after all , huh ? 
  now they are over here making a killing . 
  and they came here as refugees as well . 
  that 's really bordering on paranoia . 
  you should get a reality check , seriously . 
   each asylum seeker already costs more than 540 per month in refugee center . 
  how much ? 
  that 's the dark side of the competitive advantage romania enjoys over germany in some industries . 
  or to put it more bluntly : why would germany 's industry even invest in romania except for distribution centers if the wages were the same as over here ? 
  last time i checked , wages were actually rising fast in transilvania , that 's what invariably happens if unemployment goes low . 
   russian leverage over germany is not good for europe . 
  there is no russian leverage over germany , natural gas is a commodity and we source from lots of countries . 
  we ( western germany ) were importing gas in times of the iron curtain and never wavered in our nato commitments . 
  this is an economic deal to route around ukraine first and poland second . 
  if the russians started playing funny games , we 'd source the shit from the uk , usa or saudi-arabia . 
  see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k71ha/nord_stream2_pipeline_expansion_hurts_eu_unity/cuve7tl, 
  much less so , in fact : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k71ha/nord_stream2_pipeline_expansion_hurts_eu_unity/cuve7tl, 
  juncker is not a german . 
  above you just asked for more east asian immigrants . 
  make up your mind . 
  you are part of the un , you have a legal obligation to grant asylum to refugees . 
  since the avg . 
  wage in lithuania [ is around 550 $ / m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) , i doubt 6k is a laughable amount , you just seem very greedy . 
   germany is opposed to fiscal redistribution but here 's the thing . 
  if you wanted to build the eu , if you wanted to take us in , you need at least 1 of 2 things . 
  either you establish fiscal redistribution as a federal state would have , or you relocate more of your industry to other parts of europe . 
  what you ca n't do is you ca n't keep the industry , as well as the new workers you get from eastern europe as well as all the wealth they produce . 
  what the hell man ? 
  germany has since 20 years transitioned to an industrial model that is heavily dependent on outsourcing to eastern europe . 
  go ask in sibiu :  there are 20,300 companies with german subscribed share capital ( worth eur 4.44 billion as of the end of april 2014 ) registered with the romanian national trade register office . 
  adjusted figures put the number actually active in the romanian market at around 8,000 . 
   german direct investment in romania was 6.5 bn in 2012 . 
  [ source ] ( http://rumaenien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_rumaenien/publicatii/presse/2013/german_investments._diplomat.pdf ) . 
  that 's over 4 % of gdp in investments from germany alone . 
   since 2007 , slovakia has been the world 's largest producer of cars per capita , [ 1 ] with a total of 571,071 cars manufactured in the 2007 alone in a country with 5 million people [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automotive_industry_in_slovakia ) . 
  guess why this is ? 
  clue : foreign companies , especially from germany and france . 
   in terms of both the number of investors and the total amount invested , german companies rank first among foreign direct investors in poland . 
  in 2012 alone , german direct investments there totaled eur 3.5 billion , aggregate investment since poland 's change of political system in 1989/1990 amounting to eur 27 billion . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/laender/laenderinfos/01-nodes/polen_node.html ) where the hell are we keeping our industry ? 
  at least give the figures in ppp , nominal wages are such a shitty way to push an agenda . 
   if germany is opposing fiscal redistribution and german factories are paying romanian workers 350 euro / month , it 's fine that they need the work-force , but not ok if they want to impose quotas . 
  i wonder if anyone here constantly lambasting germany ever took the time to research what the eu actually does :  the asylum , migration and integration fund ( amif ) was set up for the period 2014-20 , with a total of eur 3.137 billion for the seven years . 
  [ ... ]  solidarity : making sure that eu states which are most affected by migration and asylum flows can count on solidarity from other eu states . 
  [ ... ]  concrete actions to be funded through this instrument can include a wide range of initiatives , such as the improvement of accommodation and reception services for asylum seekers [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/migration-asylum-borders/asylum-migration-integration-fund/index_en.htm ), 
  uh hu :  petra laszlo , working for local tv station n1tv , which is run by the anti-immigration far-right jobbik party , was caught on camera ** kicking refugees ** , including a young girl , who were fleeing a camp . 
  i am sure there is a totally innocent explanation for that too . 
  ca n't be she 's just a racist cunt and trying to goad people into attacking here , right ? 
  it needs to be said , 
   here in the uk at least most of not all immigrants will vote for left wing parties . 
  wow , the amount of conspiracy gullibility required to belief this is the reason is baffling . 
  yeah everyone wants that , it 's the facts that count . 
  and currently , germany uses probably less russian gas in % of imports than hungary . 
   the reluctance of eu eastern european countries to use russian gas i loled . 
  those countries are completely dependent on russian gas . 
  ok , where does hungary get its gas from ? 
  you should write a message to sly or one of the other mods . 
  maybe it 's a configuration thing . 
  true , i tried the url and could submit it without getting redirected or warned . 
  strange , seems like a problem with reddit itself . 
  maybe poland should not just jump to conclusions . 
  it may not be widely known , but germany is heavily dependent on natural gas because of our industry . 
  we consume insane amounts of the stuff . 
  and basf wintershall is also a gas broker selling it all over europe . 
  it 's simply not true that germany is relying on russia alone , we have pipelines like [ norpipe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norpipe ) , [ europipe i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europipe_i ) and [ ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europipe_ii ) that run to norway/the north sea . 
  western europe buys about 30 % of gas from norway and russia respectively , but russia has the highest reserves and the highest capacity , so we can do without them as much as we can do without saudi arabia when it comes to oil . 
  if you think we should find alternatives , why do n't you propose some ? 
  we 'd buy fracking gas , but [ poland has taken a clear stance ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/12/polands-shale-gas-revolution-evaporates-in-face-of-environmental-protests ) on that . 
  we buy a lot from the netherlands , but their reserves are going down . 
  i think duda is a nationalist asshole who is trying to play polish public opinion . 
  germany has been a reliable partner to poland and eastern europe and will continue to be one . 
  but blaming us for a simple pipeline extension while poland itself if fully dependent on russian gas reeks of hypocrisy of the highest order . 
  maybe poland should instead expedite building the [ baltic pipe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_pipe ) which has been in planning since 2001 instead of badmouthing germany for a change . 
  wow , that 's crazy . 
  ugh , i do n't think you can easily compare like that . 
  what kind of laws are we talking , everything from employment to criminal code ? 
  they say german laws on taxation are the most complicated and biggest worldwide . 
  you sure it 's the exact same url ? 
  one character difference and it will not count as already posted . 
  bugger me , i thought the job of reporters was to report , not beat people . 
  intelligence , both on the ground and electronically . 
  phone surveillance tells you where a certain group is located and what they are up to . 
  sat images tell you how military columns move . 
  probably was provoking an attack in herself to prove the agenda of that station they 'll find her another job once the dust had settled . 
  i love it how poland cries for unity and stuff when it comes to polish interests . 
  but they do n't do shit for unity if they ca n't make a buck . 
  as duda says , european unity is just a pretext , it 's about polish interests . 
  namely sweet transit fees . 
  btw , where does poland buy its gas , norway ? 
  https://github.com/isnow/reuropefiltered - it helps . 
  well , yes it would lead to a credit crunch for a lot of countries and - oh the irony - to a regime of austerity to arrive at a budget surplus to keep interest rates down . 
  i wonder that varoufakis ca n't see this . 
  yes , i mean you would have to find a mechanism to keep existing debt out of this - after all it was taken out under completely different juridical standards . 
  it could only apply to future debt . 
  it would be extremely interesting what happens then . 
  i am not sure if the proponents realize what the effects would be on the interest rate of countries with less than top ratings .
