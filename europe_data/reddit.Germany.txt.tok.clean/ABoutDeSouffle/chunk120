  and people probably would like to visit other countries . 
  go , eesti , you know you can do it !, 
  and rightly so . 
  [ whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ), 
  that 's why i was talking about berlin - frankfurt and hamburg - frankfurt and not berlin - hamburg . 
   the major cities connecting between each other ( berlin -- frankfurt , berlin -- hamburg , berlin -- munich ) are all ice 3 connections . 
  ok , i am outta here . 
  you go on a trip from or to berlin or hamburg and you 'll see ice 1/2 in all it 's glory . 
  you simply do n't know what you are talking about . 
  unless db pays for a dedicated replacement based on the velaro platform or its decedent , it will be ice 4 . 
  and it just reinforces my point that high-speed railways are crap in germany - berlin - frankfurt - munich , and hamburg - basel are mostly served by ice 1/2 , so no mainline highspeed for the most important cities . 
   design max is 330km/h https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_3 i was talking about ice 4 . 
  i know perfectly well how capable ice 3 is and the next gen is a step backward . 
  you could have seen this if you had read my posting with less foam at the mouth . 
   your suggestion would make trains completely useless in germany . 
  right , like the complete disaster that tgv is in france . 
   on several routes , the trains are running 360km/h + , faster than even in japan . 
  design max is 230-250km / h , [ depending on configuration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_4_ ( deutsche_bahn \\ ) )  wrong , this only applies to the ice gen 1 and 2 , for ice gen 3 there 's a seperate system with no local influence montabaur is on the ice3-only cologne-frankfurt line and still is a stop for 12k inhabitants . 
   false , that 's because of different signaling systems , the ice gen 3 on the route frankfurt -- paris can run at 360km/h the whole duration , but thalys and tgv do n't fully support the seperate signaling systems the rail track on the german side does n't permit anything like 360km/h . 
  in fact , germany [ does n't implement a french-german agreement ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/stuttgart-s-white-elephant-germany-spends-billions-on-the-wrong-rail-project-a-717575-3.html ) in time . 
  france already has finished the [ lgv est ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgv_est ) . 
  whereas in germany , the [ connections to france ] ( http://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/07/france_germany_hsr.jpg ) continue to be of potato quality . 
  guess who should built the signalling system on the german side ? 
  hint : not sncf . 
   the tgv also runs to inner city train stations , only thalys does n't , and that 's for cost reasons . 
  uh-huh . 
  spiegel has a [ nice writeup ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/frozen-in-ice-how-can-germany-s-high-speed-trains-get-back-on-track-a-699847.html ) on the real situation better get your facts straight . 
  however , our high-speed network is a joke compared to eg . 
  france , japan or spain . 
  250km/h tops and with the next-gen high-speed trains drops to 200km/h . 
  the reasons ? 
  every fucking local politician in medium-sized towns can leverage the rail operator into stopping their high-speed trains there , eventually making it impossible for trains to reach 250 + km/h . 
  ever heard of montabaur ( 12,600 people ) or plochingen ( 13,800 people ) ? 
  yep , [ they are stops ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_der_intercity-express-bahnh%c3%b6fe ) for high-speed trains . 
  enduring under-investment since ~ 20y , and especially in the last 10y because we need to balance our budget and db ( national rail operator ) was trimmed for an ipo that never happened . 
  french tgv 's have to brake after crossing the border into germany and the announcer regularly cracks jokes about the german railway system . 
  high-speed trains go into the inner cities where the stations from the 19 ^ th and early 20 ^ th century are located . 
  france frequently builds completely new stations at the periphery of towns so the trains do n't have to go slow for so long . 
  the ave network is absolutely top-notch . 
  i worked for one of the contractors for a time and are jealous as hell about the speed and promises of punctuality . 
  no , in west berlin , the trams were abolished because cars are the future , but that the s-bahn was hate was due to political reasons - it belonged and was operated by the gdr . 
  the u-bahn was extended ( line 7 and 9 were build from scratch during the cold war ), 
  it will be really interesting what happens in the next 20 years with self-driving electric cars and maybe a decline in privately owned cars and an increase in short-time rental ( car sharing ) companies . 
  i would n't be surprised to learn this leads to another reduction in rail passengers . 
  otoh , the netherlands gained rail tracks with the benelux -- france corridor as part of the eu ten-t programme , there 's the [ north-sea-mediterraneum corridor ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/ten-t-guidelines/corridors/northsea-med_en.htm ) . 
  amateurs . 
  hitler - as usual - [ would have beaten ] ( http://jalopnik.com/5819038/hitlers-giga-railway-from-paris-to-the-caspian-sea ) all existing gauges with this plans for the [ breitspurbahn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breitspurbahn ) . 
  he 'd given you high-speed rails from paris to rostov . 
  drunken fights would count as manslaughter here , not murder . 
  no , there is the combined schluchtenschei\u00dferticket . 
  and also a very subtle way to show finland who 's got the longer dick : `` yeah , we 'll just give you the peak that is your highest , we have got enough of those '', 
  try again ... 
  everything , if you just leave and join austria . 
  we 'll even reroute all power-lines through our territory . 
  `` i will not listen to any facts that threaten my prejudice '' . 
  wait , what ? 
  that 's making my head spin . 
  what 's next , jewish nazis worshiping hitler ? 
  well , if you went and killed 10 people , i 'd start taking that serious . 
  lol , you really hate positive news , huh ? 
  your argument is really faulty , sustained periods of job growth sikhs less to higher wages , esp . 
  since the unemployment rate in the uk is low . 
  the more probable reason is the uk creates low-paying service jobs and had no strong workers unions, 
  should n't you compare real wage growth , instead of nominal ? 
  when we figured that out in 2003 , we more or less wrecked the emu and new everybody hates us , 
  i am confused . 
  according to german sources , the commission will not seek penalties : http://m.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/a-1104989.html, 
   a two speed eu falls on it 's face when you realize the inner circle will hold disproportionate power to the outer one . 
  i do n't see the problem . 
  you do n't want to be part of the party , you do n't have much say and less obligations . 
  our mighty luftwaffle will protect you , 
  eh , what ? 
  lol yeah , that was n't written by someone with even a bit of pr experience . 
  but maybe that style appeals to the focus group ? 
  pal of mine teaches kids from the projects martial arts and boxing . 
  he claims he is frequently the first guy they ever take serious because they * want * to be in that class . 
  and if they come late or are a nuisance he has the power to suspend them for a while - which really bites for them . 
  truth be told , even though he is 10cm shorter than i am , he just has that no-nonsense aura . 
  after a while , they come to him and want advise for their problems and guidance . 
  he also claims those kids ca n't sit still and concentrate for an hour ( constant tv and computer games ) . 
  they need to exhaust themselves to be able to sit still for a while . 
  so , while i do see the problem , if there is a personal bond between trainer and trainee which lasts for a longer time , i think it can work . 
  ok there 's that . 
  when it comes to waterways , i 'd rather not mess with the dutch , 
  2016 really could stop that shit right now . 
  the year sure has been completely demented . 
  the plan would be to build diversions on the * left * bank of the rhine , else we 'd shrink . 
  there 's nothing in the versailles treaty forbidding that  ^ ^ ^ well ^ ^ ^ there ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ is , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ part ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ scanned, 
  maybe we 'd need to build an * [ atlantikwall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantic_wall ) * then , 
  let 's just reroute oder , nei\u00dfe , rhein , donau and all the other rivers we have at our command . 
  did n't know gaining * lebensraum * was so easy , could have spared us a war or two ... 
  dude , you should get off the internet for some time , you are the prototypical ill-informed facebook user . 
  it was the germany v netherlands friendly in hannover . 
  [ no explosives were found ] ( http://www.eurosport.com/football/international-friendlies/2015/germany-v-netherlands-cancelled-hdi-arena-evacuated-reports_sto4993717/story.shtml ) : ### update : ` no bomb , no arrests ' the initial reports , however , were contradicted by a german minister later in the evening . 
  german police found no explosives and made no arrests in hannover , the lower saxony interior minister said on tuesday . 
  `` there have been no arrests so far . 
  as for the question whether explosives were found , i can tell you that as for now , no , '' boris pistorius said during a news conference in the west german city . 
  seems you already forgot about the oktoberfest bombing ? 
  if the attacks were n't happening , it would be mexicans or blacks . 
  it 's completely easy to see how he 'd spin the police murders .
