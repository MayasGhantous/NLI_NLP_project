  it 's not the people in istanbul , but someone elected erdogan . 
  and now he 's calling the shots . 
  i would n't be surprised to hear that he indeed wants to pivot to russia . 
  i was just poking fun at / u/mz1111 for spreading the tinfoil hattery that some politicians see white people as undesirable . 
  there 's a huge conspiracy theory spanning `` white genocide '' , black helo 's , bilderbergers , chemtrails and stuff like that . 
  i love spending a bit of karma being rude to guys who sincerely believe in it . 
  i know , even as a german i find it hard to understand what sch\u00e4uble really wants - it all seems so disjointed . 
  considering the emu , he really seems to believe that everyone just has to follow our example and things will work out . 
  considering our account balance , he genuinely seems to believe it 's a good thing to have a national account balance surplus of 8 % of gdp . 
  still , i 'd say his general idea that fixing the problem * there * is better than dealing with the problems a huge migration would bring * here * is sound . 
  and i applaud that he is honest enough to say that it will cost a lot . 
  i do n't know . 
  considering that he now rails against the usa , i get the feeling he wants out of nato too . 
  and i ca n't see that he is very fond of the echr - if not even brexiteers like it , why would n't he be happy to escape it ? 
  even though i am decidedly poorer than my parents , that graph makes me so happy . 
  it 's probably one of the bigger achievements of humanity in the last 50 years . 
  globally , the lower 80 % have gotten more wealthy . 
  of course , the rise of the top 1 % is obscene . 
  but apart from that : how many people are no longer hungry where their parents still were ? 
   these are shots across the bow . 
  `` if you hurt me , i will hurt you back '' . 
  in other terms , escalation . 
   were n't most of those ethnic germans ? 
  technically yes . 
  but what does that mean for genetic diversity ? 
  probably , if we allow us to dive deep into the mud that is human genetics , they would be more slavs and other * ostv\u00f6lker * than from germanic descent . 
  eastern prussia was one hell away from what is currently germany . 
  fun fact : from south-east germany to k\u00f6nigsberg , it 's roughly 1250km . 
  from the same spot to algeria , its 1300km . 
  of course that does n't translate to genetic distance , but anyone who believes in genetic purity ( the inverse to diversity ) in europe needs their head checked . 
  the cultural distance to mena is probably higher than the genetic distance . 
  will do when i am home from work, 
  lovely . 
  so , we are at bellicose rhetoric on both sides and the will to force the other side on the side of the eu whereas britain seems to not commit to anything at all . 
  europe is falling back into its old ways faster than i imagined . 
  thanks !, 
  come on , i am sure ber will open before i retire ... 
  let 's call it what it is : moronic . 
  probably because you need de-jure actions that are grave enough . 
   rising wages and loose fiscal policy hey wait a minute , muh austerity !, 
  his ideas ( opening our markets to mena countries and giving more money for development there ) are sound . 
  the interview itself seems extremely strange , in a rambling , colloquial language . 
  i am really curious how it will read after zeit will have published it on thursday . 
  he is talking about cultural diversity . 
  so shut up about genetic diversity and go on the `` teh evilz multicultural genocide '' rant . 
  dude , you do n't know what a figure of speech is , right ? 
  he is speaking figuratively . 
  however , you are wrong , germany took in 12m refugees in 1945 - lots and lots of genetic diversity there . 
  it 's teh white genozide !, 
  ! 11 black helicopters everywhere !!, 
  this has to be the strangest interview of him ever . 
  if the quotes are literal quotes , he is using an extremely colloquial language . 
  what i have read to this point seems like the ramblings of an old geezer . 
   illeterates si tacuisses ... 
  no , it 's a figure of speech and he is talking about cultural diversity . 
  carry on !, 
   the obvious rejoinder : how has europe 's relationship to africa compared ? 
  to be fair , that 's exactly what he is saying too :  only after 1990 , we started to seriously consider the fact that something exists besides the western world . 
  to put it bluntly , the middle east kept africa from our doorstep . 
  that 's over now '' [ ... ]  one thing is clear for the future : we will have to invest more in iraq , in syria , and in libya , and we 'll have to pay more for the development of the sub-saharan region . 
  and then - what about market access for them ? 
  north-africans demand that as they keep back refugees for us . 
  but let me tell you something - they are right !, 
  the inbreeding thing is a figure of speech . 
  sch\u00e4uble is intelligent enough to know that genetic variety in a 80m country is high enough . 
  the `` enormous innovative potential '' is to be taken literal though . 
  i am not totally sure what he is referring to , as i have n't heard about turkish 2 ^ nd/3 ^ rd gen women as innovation leaders . 
  probably he is out to troll / r/europe a bit in between eating greek children alive and planning the demise of the uk . 
  according to the article , mogherini as well :  no country introducing the death penalty can become an eu member state '', 
  if you want to play a leading role , you have to have skin in the game . 
  other countries will be lead only if there is reason to trust you are going to be a good leader . 
  i would argue the uk has n't been exceptionally good at european participation and brexit is sending a clear signal concerning that . 
  so , even if britain were to ready to play a leading role , who are the ones that entrust it with leading ? 
  without money , it 's going to be hard . 
  it means that in germany , people spend too little . 
   to keep the euro from getting even weaker . 
  more like the franken from becoming too strong . 
  * wooooosh *, 
  well , then they should make up their minds . 
  5 years ago :  i will probably be the first polish foreign minister in history to say so , but here it is : i fear german power less than i am beginning to fear german inactivity . 
  you have become europe 's indispensable nation, 
  they want a weak and fragmented europe that just pays for their shit . 
  yes , because it is 25 years later . 
  they were treated like shit back then . 
  in eastern germany as well , yes . 
  i 'd consider the ex-gdr at that time to be squarely in cee . 
  typically , in a market economy , increased demand increases supply . 
  and in well-managed societies , social housing also should react to increased demand . 
  it 's only because they have found a better scapegoat . 
  20 years ago , vietnamese were hunted and beaten up in cee . 
  well , they have poison gas attacks by their natives . 
  btw : why is scandinavia so particularly bad at creating affordable housing ? 
   make the case that from the 1960s to the mid-1980s the regulation of health , safety and environmental risks were generally stricter in the us ; whereas ** since the 1990s the positions have been reversed ** . 
   a broad quantitative analysis of specific precaution based on a sample of 100 risks drawn from a dataset of nearly 3000 risks ** from the 1970s up to 2004 ** in both the usa and the eu  there are 36 risks that show greater us precaution and 31 risks that show greater eu precaution one would have to read the study , it could well be a trick : take half the risks from the 1970 's and 80 's and the result would be balanced . 
  take samples from 2000 onward , and the picture might be completely different . 
  the debate around ttip is not about 35yo risk management but about the current state of things and whether it would water down the achieved level of regulation . 
  no one believes californian seat-belt regulation from the late 60 's would be endangered . 
  hehe , that 's why there had been quite a complicated diplomatic dance when germany was asked to extradite terrorists to the us ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/21/world/germany-sends-embassy-terror-suspect-to-us.html ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/17/world/bonn-may-balk-at-extraditing-terror-suspect.html ) , [ 3 ] ( https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19870119&amp;id=cxcfaaaaibaj&amp;sjid=whifaaaaibaj&amp;pg=2216,4147491 ) ) . 
  of course , the burgers were not amused , especially ashcroft post 9/11 , the lowlife . 
  they are not invited .
