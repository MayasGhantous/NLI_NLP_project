  imo , the countries profiting would be the usual suspects : usa , germany , switzerland . 
  a couple member states probably would dislike it , but it would happen more or less automatically if the uk leaves . 
  do they also have a service at sergey prokofiev airport ? 
  because i reported it . 
  also because it was some really lame attempt at trolling , 2/10 , ca n't do more for you . 
  i doubt this has any chance to pass , but yeah it would put a sensible price on risk of sovereign lending . 
  wait , i got to report this , brb . 
  that homeopathy shit was invented here : /, 
  ahahaha , that was tiny in comparison . 
  you need consumption to keep up impetus . 
  aging population = too little consumption . 
  that currently bites japan and greece and will bite a lot of countries like germany and eastern europe down the road . 
  and if their population is further declining , they wo n't have more jobs down the road . 
  ever wondered how germany post-war coped with 12m refugees in the face of large-scale destruction and no jobs ? 
  they 'll find other excuses 10 years down the road . 
  no , it is not . 
  a lot of eastern european countries are right on the heels of germany in terms of shrinking population . 
  look up bulgaria . 
  those countries either will get even poorer or do something about their population decline . 
  taking up more immigrants is one conceivable measure . 
  you were n't so loud about then when you wanted at the eu 's pork barrels ... as i wrote above , solidarity is only when it benefits you and costs others . 
   the point is that refugees do benefit germany . 
  and certainly do not benefit most of eastern europe . 
  ^ [ citation ^ required ]  and let 's instead try to deal with the situation not with ethics but with statistics and economics . 
  or maybe [ international treaties and laws ] ( http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a14 ) ? 
  or [ binding rules of the eu ] ( http://www.ecre.org/refugees/refugees/refugees-in-the-eu.html ) for that matter ? 
  there are [ lots of them ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum/index_en.htm ) and the eastern european states signed up to them when they acceded to the eu . 
  ever wonder how it looked after germans fled the gdr ? 
   i do n't know . 
  that 's why i 'm asking this sub come on , man you can use the whole internet to at least research things like that , it 's really not hard . 
  very nice work , thanks  if you want to continue working on it and need it support , tell me . 
   what 's the matter with eastern europe ? 
  just three decades ago , `` solidarity '' was its symbol . 
  today , a more appropriate symbol would be a bumper sticker reading `` eastern europe : where donald trump comes off looking good . 
  solidarity is only if it benefits them . 
  else it is extortion . 
   the part of the surplus that is with the eurozone is making it hard for other eu countries to recover , that 's a fact . 
  you are mentally stuck in the past . 
  there is * next to no * surplus against the ez at large , it 's a couple hundred million eur . 
  [ official german data to show how the exports to emu have declined ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/nationaleconomyenvironment/foreigntrade/foreigntradeindicators/eutrade.html ) , i mean just look at the freaking data . 
  the netherlands has a higher surplus ( [ oldish 2011 data ] ( http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/dossiers/eu/publicaties/archief/2012/2012-3620-wm.htm ) , [ 2012 on p 70 ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/art2_mb201301en_pp59-74en.pdf ) , but still not much different today ) against the ez than germany , why do n't you go bashing them ? 
  does it matter ? 
  most likely he would have become a neo-nazi else , horst mahler-style . 
  talking about alternative universes is n't that enlightening . 
  see my edit , there 's a much clearer chart with shorter intervals that makes the tendency as well as the actual relationship crystal clear . 
  and not , it 's absolutely not unfounded , how do you arrive at that conclusion in the face of actual data ? 
  then you really have n't been following news about lau . 
  i mean he was on every large news site years ago . 
  [ there you go ] ( http://www.finanzen100.de/finanznachrichten/wirtschaft/defending-germany-s-trade-surplus_h473292935_184615/ ) , good sir . 
  edit : do n't like the source ? 
  there 's [ others ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/raoulruparel/2015/07/22/bernanke-german-trade-surplus/ ), 
   this guy `` lau '' , the german convert to islam only came to the attention of the police when he started parading around his own police force wearing dayglow jackets . 
  come on man , just stop writing about countries you have no knowledge of . 
  lau has been in the police 's visors for quite some time , he has just until now been intelligent enough not to give them a case . 
  that might change now . 
  yeah , i guess that 's why lau is now finding himself in front of a court soon . 
   a sudden inflow of religious authoritarian hatemongers did you even fucking read what i wrote ? 
  ** lau is a fucking native german who never inflowed from nowhere ** . 
  it 's getting ridiculous with you types , that guy is our very own lunatic . 
  there 's zero indication for trade barriers from the eu coming down your way . 
  the uk has gone from euro-sceptic to outright eu-paranoid . 
  no , that surplus is mostly with non-emu countries . 
  art 14 declaration of human rights . 
  read it . 
  if the uk knows what 's good for them they wo n't erect trade barriers or starts trade war with the eu . 
  that would hurt them more than the eu . 
  where would that be ? 
  shit posters ? 
  oh yes . 
  before panties get bunched again , the leader of that is as native german as i am . 
  lau is a world-class asshole but he is no migrant . 
  which numbers ? 
  a couple million refugees do n't make a majority, 
  personally and jobwise , i ca n't see how it would concern me . 
  they are not in the emu . 
  they are not in schengen . 
  agricultural subsidies are frozen , so less money would just mean smaller pay-outs . 
  economically , i 'd say the effects would even out : on the one hand higher contributions to the eu budget , on the other probably some jobs in financials would move to frankfurt from london , so more taxes here . 
  politically , it would be a wash too . 
  one market-friendly country gone , but otoh the german weight in decisions would increase even more . 
  and decisions could be reached more easily so for me it would be a non-event . 
  why would it hurt german manufacturing ? 
  the currency barrier is in place now , so there would n't change much . 
  i know i would trust a company in the baltic 10x more . 
  if it were b2c , it would n't matter that much , but with the future of russian market access in the west in doubt . 
  i 'd be very reluctant in doing b2b with a russian company right now . 
  someone 's got to take the trash out . 
  ha makes the claims , he better support them with facts , not some anecdotes . 
  uh , so we have a 28 % export surplus , thanks ecb i guess . 
  i just hope the eur recovers somewhat . 
  especially if we pick the arguments to suit our agenda . 
  you do n't seem to understand `` anecdotal '' ? 
  so , lacking facts , we take anecdotal as evidence now ? 
  from the images , this is not a german railcar , but most likely austrian or eastern european . 
  so , probably they were riding that car for 8 + hours and if the recent videos are anything to judge , it was overcrowded to boot . 
  there 's a chance they would have gotten a lot of stuff , from teddy bears to refreshments in munich and would disembark the train without directions . 
  wan na see how a train looks after german soccer fans have been riding it ? 
  http://imgur.com/a/8xlap but yeah op , nice way to strengthen the image of the dirty mudskin refugee . 
  i hope you choke on your food . 
  i dunno man , i have been to nyc ...
