  something , something 4th reich . 
   they should have offered more reforms i disagree . 
  watering down the eu to the point of a free market and nothing else is not in the best interest of everyone . 
  the eu has the right and the fucking duty to stay true to their guiding principles like freedom of movement . 
  sad . 
  we are living in times where closer cooperation would be needed on issues like the environment , the second wave of digitization and the end of the regular workplace , globalization and mass migration . 
  to see countries going back to the seemingly secure national identity is n't what i was hoping for . 
  the right-wing populists do not really offer solutions , all they do is exaggerate existing problems . 
  i really liked the eu and today its future seems so uncertain and britain so hostile towards us : /, 
  sounds doubtful . 
  anyone got a source for that . 
  that 's not what i mean . 
  russia is already using the kosovo precedent with crimea and imo is n't completely disingenuous in doing so . 
  if scotland can unilaterally break away , the very next day kurds will do so , from turkey , iraq and syria . 
  and then it 'll get very bloody . 
  you are forgetting two things : first , there 's a hell of a language barrier between european countries . 
  that pesky frogs just wo n't adopt german . 
  in fact , not even the swamp-germans do . 
  second , european countries have constructed a narrative that they look back on centuries of a national tradition ( that 's not entirely accurate because in a lot of countries there was no uninterrupted continuity due to wars ) . 
  i have no idea how to gradually overcome this towards a shared european identity . 
  and unless it is overcome , it will always be '' ** we ** are paying for ** them ** '' ( see german attitude towards greece ) or '' ** they ** are commanding ** us ** around '' ( almost every country towards germany ), 
  the `` unite with ireland '' - part is not what i am concerned about . 
  it 's the secession i am unsure about . 
  the gdr was a sovereign country . 
  i am sure some in the eu would love to stick it to the british , but the very next second they 'll remember the clusterfuck that was the breakup of yugoslavia and just keep their traps shut . 
  the boomerang that was [ kosovo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_independence_precedent ) is probably still haunting some . 
  personally , i think regions should be free to secede if they want to , but i can see this would completely redefine our idea of what a state is . 
  you are overestimating the influence industry has on politics here . 
  if this were negotiations over a trade deal with the uk , there would be a lot of backroom-talks and lobbying . 
  but they ca n't stop politicians giving interviews . 
  there were quite some voices before the referendum that stressed that `` out means out and no backsies '' . 
  there 's more to come , just you wait for it . 
  this ever so much . 
  for all its flaws , the eu is one of the few institutions that tries to build a better future . 
  it 's really sad how it gets abused by nationalists lately . 
  and now it is in danger of breaking apart . 
  i 'd really hope you were right and all the sweet money went to paris and frankfurt , but i doubt it . 
  there will be an impact , but there 's a lot of momentum if you are one of the largest financial hubs . 
  over the long run , i could see london losing out to shanghai or another chinese financial center , but that 's decades away . 
   which may federalize in next decades do n't hold your breath . 
  most likely , things will get ugly fast . 
  unfortunately , neither france nor germany have a real statesman at the helm that could give the eu a new vision . 
  trying to force a federation now is going to blow back big time . 
   this cooperation runs deep and ca n't be broken by a vote . 
  let 's see . 
  i fully expect the relationship to be scaled back to a trade deal . 
  lol he showed his true colors somewhat quick . 
  the good thing is we wo n't have this insufferable clown in the european parliament any more . 
  german dax is down 11 % pre-opening . 
  i am not sure ( and i am really not sure ) if that 's possible . 
  i do n't believe the eu or any western country will recognize a unilateral referendum unless the ruk greenlights it . 
  and breaking away from the uk without their blessing would scare spain shitless - i can see how they would block scottish accession to the eu for ages . 
  the sultan will see to that . 
  ca n't wait for some of the geniuses in our parliament to go on air stressing how the time for enforcing rules has come now and the uk has to suffer the full consequences of their actions . 
  well , that 's that then . 
  sad times , for me at least . 
  farewell then , and godspeed . 
  bad timing they had their referendum in the years before . 
  now it 's going to be hard to get another one . 
  very well , got that nailed . 
  now , how do we convince the hungarians and poles to leave as well ? 
  good job impersonating the kraut with a complete lack of humor there , 
  depends who 's giving the head , amirite ? 
  guys ? 
  absolutely . 
  morocco is a model economy , you should try to be them . 
  seriously ? 
  german newspapers are wall-to-wall `` pretty please stay '' . 
  bild today is [ quite funny ] ( https://i.imgur.com/lautyod.jpg ) : `` dear brits , if you vote remain , even we will acknowledge the [ wembley goal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghost_goal#1966_world_cup_final ) '' . 
  according to their front-page , germany will : - stop making jokes about prince charles ' ears - stop using sunscreen at the beach out of solidarity with your sunburns - dispense with our goal keeper at the next penalty shoot-out so that it stays exciting - introduce tea time , drunk from buckets at mallorca 's infamous ballermann - voluntarily provide the bad guy for every james bond - act like you and set their clocks back an hour - push through an eu directive forbidding the head on beer - use our towels to reserve places for you at the hotel pool - get jogi l\u00f6w to guard your crown jewels - all come to the queen 's 100th birthday, 
  written in the font of that movie . 
  you championed the eastern enlargement , that was no idea the francophone part of the eu liked too much . 
  what the hell ? 
  who is even talking about a stop of trading ? 
  that 's a red herring if i have ever seen one . 
  between a trade stop and business as now , there 's a lot of possibilities for reduced trade due to tariffs and taxes , diverging standards and so on . 
  that 's a well shaft . 
  i was n't talking about the linked article , do n't know how you got to the impression it is the only article about brexit . 
  heh , there is a bit of a bitter taste considering how the eu , france or indeed germany are painted in the british press . 
  in the end , among democratic institutions , a solution is usually found and so i 'd expect the eu to take britain back , but a sense of `` not again '' could also prevail . 
  that sounds as likely as britain adopting the eur . 
  * sigh * from every country , quotes from people in the street . 
  from germany ? 
  one full page about `` heil hitler '' gauland . 
  thanks , i guess . 
  but then , i 'd wish my fellow-countrymen were not that goddamn happy to enforce rules no matter what . 
  no need to run around crowing that `` out means out '' . 
  eh , the two airports are a completely different size . 
  the one on st. helena is for a handful of a320 class planes per week whereas ber is the third largest in germany , built for planes up to the a380 . 
  ber is an impressive feat of incompetence , but that 's about the only parallel . 
  we 'd bail them out again , but considering how they treated vidkun ... 
  russia has a higher gdp than ukraine , so i doubt a lot of russians would move there - except for troops of course . 
   being against the brexit is either nationalistic or patriotic of course not . 
  what i meant to say is orban is able to defuse the usual antagonism between remain and nationalism here much better than anything i have seen by sidestepping any facts and going straight for the heart . 
  furthermore , it does n't try to convey a complex message , it does n't challenge the intellect . 
  it 's a 1s appeal to gut feelings . 
  so , well done , all around , exactly the kind of messages that work in modern media democracies . 
  it appeals to emotions , specifically nationalism - one of the things orban is really good at . 
  that coming from a country that used brutal oppression to stop a secession . 
  i always wonder how they procreate with all those pixels .
