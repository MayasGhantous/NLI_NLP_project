  germany is typically invited to peace negotiations ( ukraine , israel ) and difficult talks ( iran ) because it is well respected as trustworthy arbitrator . 
  i am proud to live in a country that has and uses soft power instead beating on its chest and demanding respect from everyone our else . 
  times have changed , the bully is not respected , c.f. 
  what kind of demented logic is that ? 
  and yeah , no one respects us ... 
   and here is a suitably patriotic image very subtle . 
  could use some more fighter jets , though . 
  one question : what does the godiva riding a moose symbolize ? 
  also : congrats !, 
  that date created the source of much banter and shit-talking between your love dove countries . 
  parliamentarians swear no oath in germany , however the president , the chancellor and the ministers do . 
  they are free to include the religious reference if they want to ( it 's the default by law , but they can opt out of it ) . 
  [ it says ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0266 ) :  `` i swear that i will dedicate my efforts to the well-being of the german people , promote their welfare , protect them from harm , uphold and defend the basic law and the laws of the federation , perform my duties conscientiously , and do justice to all . 
  so help me god . '' schr\u00f6der in 1998 was the only chancellor to this day to use the non-religious version of the oath . 
  7 of his 13 ministers [ also did n't mention god ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kabinetts-vereidigung-schroeder-will-keine-hilfe-von-oben-a-219304.html ) which is the highest ratio ever . 
  the first minister to forgo the religious component was one from the spd in 1969 . 
  or the eu could do neither and instead look for its own advantage without either cutting the uk a sweetheart deal or giving them a punishingly bad deal . 
  ever listened to von storch ? 
  she 's as dumb as it gets and she is still in a high position . 
  i think poles just do n't like anyone else . 
  maybe not even themselves, 
  then stop patronizing us , we 're obviously doing ok, 
  actually yes - and engl\u00e4nder is more common . 
  sorry about that , mate , 
  eh , that was to be expected , was n't it ? 
  guilt-tripping germans is n't exactly uncommon , russia did it , poland did it , israel , iran ... 
  considering the turkish `` pride \u00fcber alles `` attitude , i expect a lot more of that going forward . 
  * sigh * a submarine battle in the atlantic ... without us ? 
  that 's just not right . 
  just because it does n't work does n't mean russia is n't doing it . 
  the ussr and the gdr tried for decades to destabilize the frg - by aiding terrorist groups , creating sleeper cells and paying extremists . 
  russia today pays right-wing populist parties to divide our societies . 
  russia has been caught by fabricating news stories ( the `` girl raped by refugees '' ) to specifically incite racial hatred . 
  it 's hard to believe , but russia * is actually * that despicable . 
  this is an aspect that is unfortunately underappreciated . 
  there 's actually a right to asylum and most every developed nation has signed this convention . 
  what merkel did was being true to contractual obligations . 
  most other countries did not follow the lead and obviously a lot of refugees wanted to move to germany specifically for a mix of safety and economical reasons . 
  so , under the current circumstances , the geneva convention seems impossible to fulfill . 
  so what ? 
  that 's a critique of current germany 's poliltics that has nothing to do with the holocaust . 
  whereas japan is hated because it never fully owned up to its war crimes and still plays games with compensations to get statues in korea removed . 
  no country is universally loved , just look at the things people here write about eastern europe , the usa or greece . 
  or actually cheering for brexit to get rid of the uk . 
  actually , the usa is a good example . 
  as a global hegemon , everything it does is put under scrutiny . 
  often enough , they get damned for doing things ( like invading countries to stop wars ) and damned for not doing them ( not invading in other conflicts ) . 
  germany is a regional power that mostly calls the shots in the eu , and therefore , you 'll read a lot of scathing criticism , no matter what our politics do or do n't - especially from self-insecure nations like the uk or the whole butthurt belt aka vysegrad four . 
  while i do n't agree with the criticism concerning the refugee situation , it 's still about criticizing a certain political decision , same with the greek criticism of sch\u00e4uble 's intransigence . 
  and that 's different from universally hating us . 
  on reddit , you need a thicker skin . 
  how 's germany hated , just read this thread , dude, 
  so , humanitarian values are also bad now . 
  you are hilarious . 
  i know and i do think that bush , wolfowitz and cheney should be tried for war crimes . 
  however bad it is , it was n't a genocide though and i also think the distinction is important . 
  damned , they are ashamed of nothing . 
  not even instrumentalizing the holocaust to try to shut up the german parliament . 
  it is not - or should n't be - about shame , though . 
  i do n't feel shame about the holocaust , because i was n't alive back then . 
  it would be absurd and counter-productive to feel shame about something you can not be possibly responsible for . 
  it is about remembering so the descendants of the victims know people care and wo n't let them down again ( in every genocide , the majority looks the other way ) . 
  and it 's about knowing genocides happen , they happen with certain patterns and one can recognize those patterns early . 
  we are not there , yet . 
  but the world certainly has better standards now and at least tries to react earlier . 
  unfortunately , genocides today are also happening much faster . 
  and lastly , it helps with the neighbors ( that 's not a problem for canada ) . 
  germany is mostly well-liked and there are no awkward moments like japanese leaders face whenever they visit korea or china . 
  most everyone knows we came clean about it , we are a different country now and so , we do n't have to [ embarrass ourselves about statues ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/southkorea/12075523/comfort-women-statue-threatens-to-derail-japan-south-korea-accord.html ) . 
  that plane in the photo would be one of the [ bombardier 5000 's ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombardier_global ) , however , the german government for long-range flights flies the considerably larger airbus - from a319 to a340 . 
  no one is debating that . 
  point is the soviets and eastern europeans went full isis as well . 
  sure , but a thriving economy creates more jobs and hence more tax income . 
  look at germany . 
   west germany recognised the genocide of the roma in 1982 , [ 66 ] and since then the porajmos has been increasingly recognized as a genocide committed simultaneously with the shoah second paragraph in the `` recognition and remembrance '' section of your wiki link . 
  of course the memorial should have been erected earlier , and we were late in [ paying compensation ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?moduleid=10005219 ) :  only in late 1979 did the west german federal parliament identify the nazi persecution of roma as being racially motivated , creating eligibility for most roma to apply for compensation for their suffering and loss under the nazi regime . 
  by this time , many of those who became eligible had already died . 
  [ german wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/porajmos#rezeption_und_aufarbeitung_des_porajmos_nach_1945 ) is much better , it says that victims could claim limited compensation after a landmark court decision in 1963 , got a lump sum of 5000 dm in 1982 ( however also notes that compensation of romani victims was way worse than for others ) . 
  in 1982 , then-chancellor schmidt received a romani delegation and officially recognized porajmos as racially motivated genocide . 
  his successor kohl affirmed that in 1985 and president herzog called it on par with the holocaust in 1997 . 
  could have , should have been doing that earlier , but apart from that i think we are doing ok ... 
  no , that 's how populism works : you rally everyone around you by creating the myth that the world is full of external enemies and you are the leader the country needs to confront them . 
  then you wait for provocations or even provoke them like erdogan did and then you claim `` see , told you so '' . 
  this way , you worsen the relationships to other countries but cement your government . 
  and s time passes , you can try to get something out of those `` enemies '' by backpedaling a bit . 
  russia , poland , turkey , farage , trump ... 
  turkey already recalled their ambassador . 
  probably will find a couple of ways to needle us like cancelling the refugee pact . 
  this one has a [ memorial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memorial_to_the_sinti_and_roma_victims_of_national_socialism ) in the center of berlin . 
  sorry about that , my granddad [ left it here ] ( http://www.geralds-bahnseiten.de/kurios01.jpg ) , you want to reclaim it ? 
  if * you * say so ... 
  but the handouts make the complaining twice as nice ... 
  dude , poland gets more out of the eu than any other country . 
  more than the next three combined if i remember right . 
  so please , stuff the victim complex . 
  which has been true [ only rarely in the case of france ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=fradebt2gdp&amp;v=201605232210n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) . 
   we should definitely strive to fill that objective  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 you seem to be making fun of rules and regulations ... 
  dude , you are dodging the issue . 
  you asked for examples which problems further integration might solve , i gave them to you . 
  i do n't think the eu uses it as a political tool .
