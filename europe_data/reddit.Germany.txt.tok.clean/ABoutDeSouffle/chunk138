  you do n't have the first idea what those words `` exponential '' , `` sigmoidal '' or `` linear '' mean , right ? 
  looks sigmoidal to me , but sure as hell linear from 1980 to 2000 . 
  they are not growing exponentially . 
  i think you mean j-20 . 
  also : whatever evolves x-2 shinshin into . 
  thanks a lot . 
  i seriously had no idea that there was such a big difference - in favor of germany . 
   above japan you sure ? 
  that sounds strange . 
  do n't know why you get downvoted , i also expect a second wave of digitization coupled with advanced sensors and actuators which should put lots of people , from truckers and factory workers to middle management out of work . 
  i could be wrong , but i believe the netherlands enjoy similar growth , but they had kind of a property bubble . 
  as to the reasons : partly because germany is one of the most open economies in the world :  the weight of evidences is that openness to trade is good for economic prosperity . 
  hereafter few estimates of the economic benefits of trade openness : - the long-term evidence from a broad sample of oecd countries indicates that an increase of 10 % in trade exposure was associated with a 4 % increase in output per working-age person - according to the world bank , in the 1990s per capita income grew more than three times faster for those developing countries that lowered trade barriers ( 5 % per year ) than for other developing countries ( 1.4 % per year ) [ source from the uk gov ` t ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/43312/11-721-economic-openness-and-prosperity.pdf )  the german economy is powered by exports . 
  its current-account balance ( the difference between the money it receives from the outside world and what it spends abroad ) is one of the world 's largest , at 7 % of gdp . 
  it is an open economy : ** its ratio of exports to gdp is double china 's ** . 
  [ economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/10/economist-explains-14 ) also a combination of keeping the right industrial base while outsourcing and offshoring the labor-intensive parts ( iirc , german companies are leading foreign direct investors in central/eastern europe ) , strong brands and sheer luck ( finland got unlucky when nokia collapsed * and * the relationship with russia soured ) . 
  it could well be that google , apple et al. 
  will threaten the german economic success in the coming years if they disrupt car manufacturing by their focus on self-driving electrical cars . 
  the german economy is diversified , but a lot is dependent on car manufactoring . 
  that 's just wishful thinking . 
  additionally , nuclear rockets are a moronic idea, 
  not sure if i should laugh ... 
  that makes me believe the usa hobbled their crews on purpose , like the famous red flag exercise where typhoons shot down raptors . 
  this however seems to be more about capabilities of the tank crews than engineering . 
  and i do n't believe german tanks are any better than us ones - they are probably investing a multiple of what we do in research and development . 
   the leverage is germany would lose more as a result of greek collapse than as a result of forgiving debt . 
  that would have never worked . 
  at the time it became crystal clear that greece was falsifying statistics left , right and center . 
  the moral hazard of erasing greek debt was totally clear . 
  furthermore , it would have been stopped by the german supreme court as it was a clear violation of emu treaties . 
  there 's also something called the greek banking system which held a lot of greek bonds and would have been dead the day after a default . 
  it is to everyone 's guess what would have happened then , but my take is it would n't have been pretty either ( not saying it was pretty as it was ) . 
  idk . 
  if a member violates basic principles , it 's a sign of weakness to do nothing about that . 
  at the very least , russia should be suspended . 
   western europe might be roughly stable friends of mine relocated to the usa recently because they believe western europe has less stable than it was 15 years ago and while they do n't believe a war is likely , they at least think it is possible in their life time . 
  i do n't agree , but it gave me a pause . 
  german politicians and army would do no such thing . 
  at least as far as we know , it 's as likely as the u.s. just shrugging their shoulders . 
   blank slatism does n't even exist , except in your imagination . 
  i guess you 'd be surprised at the level of graphical detail in antique paintings of sex positions, 
  do n't ask me , i 'd take the slut every time over the virgin . 
  i guess it 's some deep sense of `` you ca n't ever be sure you are the one who knocked her up '' unless she is a virgin . 
  they typically pay in looted money . 
  bonuses are in virgin sex slaves . 
  that 's ok , the guys are going to learn a lot about boring reddit ramblings , 
  i will not lie , i knew all of those nasheeds as i listen to them at work . 
  i hate to see the demise of da'esh - where am i am going to get my radical sunni nasheeds ? 
  thanks , ecb , i guess . 
  if you believe europe can rest on its laurels and just stop getting more competitive without severe repercussions , be my guest . 
  china and the whole eastern asia is just waiting for us to get complacent so they can eat our lunch . 
  they are nearly as capable of producing goods in the same quality as we are - and their wages are way lower and will stay lower for quite some time . 
  europe either has to increase competitiveness or lower wages or do a bit of both , but simply closing our eyes and denying facts is not going to help anybody . 
  besides , what a lot of people seem to miss is that since a couple of years , germany [ does ** not ** have a sizable trade surplus ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/raoulruparel/files/2015/07/de-monthly-trade-upd.jpg ) against emu countries , which basically means the other emu countries have caught up in terms of competitiveness ( or german production costs have risen relative to them ) . 
  ah , i did n't get it . 
  carry on !, 
   let 's not forget that the ttip is germany 's solution for the eurozone . 
  hang on , so ttip is * our * invention ? 
  of course to subdue poor eurozone countries . 
  next thing you are going to claim germany invented the eurozone , or what ? 
  i think the `` friendlyness ranking '' takes legal aspects into account first and size of an lgbti community would factor much lower . 
  however , if you are a small country where lgbsomething people just move to neighboring countries if they do n't like it here , the pressure to adapt things like laws around sex change or marriage equality is way lower . 
  you just fell for a troll . 
  the sad thing is that the fact they were wrong here is not going to change their prejudice one little bit . 
  trying to block out reality when it threatens your world view . 
  yeah that 's a new one for pegida types . 
  i care shit about that , i am just trying to inject facts into a complete cluster-fuck . 
  last year in berlin , we had an official nut-job threatening to kill police shouting allahu snackbar . 
  was n't even a muslim . 
  name is given as `` paul h. '' , so obviously an immigrant . 
  but do n't let facts disturb a good unfounded rant . 
  after what i read in german news sources , the guy is as german as i am . 
  everyone just jumps on the rage train without waiting for any facts . 
  paul kind . 
  first name is paul . 
  probably an illegal immigrant from the usa . 
  seemingly [ 27-yo native german from hessen named paul h ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/grafing-mann-verletzt-vier-personen-mit-messer-a-1091534.html ) . 
  name is given as `` paul h. '' , so obviously an immigrant . 
  why is that ? 
  yugoslavia was n't even a member state . 
  if anything , both nato and the un are as well to blame . 
  i am not so sure . 
  the eu is currently having a bad time , lots of things coming together that make a breakup more likely . 
  brexit could be one of those paper-cuts . 
  imo it all depends on demographics . 
  ** if ** populations in central/eastern euro nations are growing faster than those in the richer countries , there 's a good chance to catch up and eventually overtake . 
  otoh , if populations stagnate and age , their catch-up will fizzle in the next decade or two and they 'll stay in lower middle class for very long . 
  and the uk was absolutely not alone in struggling in the 1970 's . 
  this talk about reverting to developing status was probably the panic mode of the day back then . 
  if only someone invented a world trade organization that could set up supra-national courts, 
  yeah , he was wrong about czech republic, 
  scarce resources . 
  the idea that more recipients of welfare means higher taxes to raise the money . 
  and higher taxes stifle economic growth . 
  i do n't fully subscribe to this - especially given germany 's low rate of unemployed . 
  otoh , the usa with their relatively low social security seem to grow like crazy compared to the eu . 
  imo , in the end it all depends on how long the war in syria will be going on . 
  after something like 10y , probably most refugees will want to stay here . 
  and then it depends on how well they are integrated into the labor market . 
  if the majority fails to find a job and stays on social security , it could well hamper growth .
