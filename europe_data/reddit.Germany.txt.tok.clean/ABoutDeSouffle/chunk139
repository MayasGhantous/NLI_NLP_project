  if they integrate well , there 'll be an increase in gdp growth . 
  i do n't really care one way or the other , but that was for 2017 and reflects mostly additional demand . 
  refugees are not work migrants first , but they 'll need years to find jobs or finish education . 
  that 's when they 'll contribute more to gdp growth in the best case . 
  however , like in most developed economies , your growth rate in % will go down like ours did . 
  usa and uk seem to be the notable exceptions . 
  paying debnts !, 
  i am sure they will . 
  as usual , carpet bombing another living quarter in syria or vanishing a couple of chechens . 
  oh sure , and be sure to bring hygge with you . 
  that 's right , and the brexit negotiations will conclude * p\u00fcnktlich * in two years time . 
  then it gets interesting ( and i guess we 'll find out in the next two years ) . 
  the uk is still an eu member , so the eu will take them to court . 
  aww , 20y ago , i visited the high tatra a couple of times . 
  it 's such a great place , i have to go back there sometimes . 
  uhh , eu accession requires the candidate to fulfill a number of criteria . 
  if the country does , it can join . 
  turkey never really worked hard to get reforms implemented over the whole spectrum . 
  the root cause probably is the demographic decline of urban turkey relative to the rural parts . 
  are you high or what ? 
  since when is genocide a means of politics ? 
  this . 
  the eu does not need to react to every provocation . 
  just let him hang out to dry and do n't bite . 
  he wo n't be sultan forever . 
  i am not very fond of sch\u00e4uble , our minister of finance , but i loved how in a recent interview he remarked in passing that continuing to pay turkey structural aid was `` hard to justify in the current political climate '' . 
  translation : you wo n't see any extra money from us . 
  that only goes so far . 
  if the economy crashes , he will be held accountable by a lot of voters . 
  not that i believe crashing the turkish economy was a bright idea . 
  ok , you did it . 
  good job . 
  destroying their economy is exactly how you get a islamist enemy . 
  there is no `` we '' anymore if you insist on atrocities . 
  this is pizza we are talking about , not any old food . 
  i am not sure what good would come from destroying their economy . 
  it would cause a civil war like in syria - and tbh i 've enough from watching atrocities being committed for a while . 
  and then what ? 
  turkey has a lot more people than syria . 
  imagine 20m refugees in greece ... 
  the world is currently destabilizing by itself , no need to accelerate the process . 
  europe should do the wise thing and wait it out . 
  even the sultan will be fine one day . 
  unfortunately , there 's a strong minority of both extreme left and extreme right-wingers who loathe the usa and idealize russia . 
  man , i hope you are right . 
  after the brexit referendum and the u.s. election , i am still a bit shaken , so please : no surprises , dutch bro 's . 
  not the only country we need to cut the customs union with : - , 
  it must be really hard , being caught in such a confronting . 
  i hope you do n't get too many shitty reactions from germans . 
  i bet you can ever find shells on the beach . 
  eh , i do n't know . 
  trump has softened his big words about the eu . 
  putin has n't done anything but crying `` no fair '' about the sanctions . 
  and erdogan ? 
  he practically pleaded with germany to bring back investments and tourism , because the turkish economy is suffering . 
  beating on your chest is n't the same as being able to walk over another county . 
  it basically helps all parties . 
  erdogan has an external enemy to rally the people behind his power-grab . 
  rutte can show his people he 's no pushover . 
  putin is happy , because nato is tearing at the seams . 
  trump can point to the problems of you have a sizable muslim minority . 
  merkel is happy - she can do what she does best - nothing . 
  and eastern europe can point fingers and continue being racist . 
  so , what 's not to like ? 
   f , for example , in america only 50-percent of officer involved shootings lead to a deceased suspect , but 75-percent of the german shootings lead to death , then that would in fact prove it 's the german police that are the death squads that would then mean us police are something like 8x as trigger-happy . 
  i just ca n't argue with that kind of logic , so it 's ok , mr. armchair-firearms-expert , you win . 
  that 's what makes me nervous , though . 
  monday and tuesday are big carnival celebrations . 
  uh hu , then let 's look at the numbers , shall we ? 
  - people killed by police in germany ( in 2015 ) : [ 10 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/waffengebrauch_der_polizei_in_deutschland ) - people killed by police in murrica ( in 2015 ) : [ 991 ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/ ) - inhabitants of germany : 81m - inhabitants of the usa : 319m - predicted police killls in germany based on us data : ** 39 ** - predicted police killls in the usa based on german data : ** 252 ** do you happen to see a difference there , perchance ? 
  yeah that 's why they have such a low homicide rate , compared to us . 
  guy 's dead , though . 
  stop embarrassing yourself . 
  you and i know nothing about the situation and why the cops shot . 
  we know he 's alive though . 
  in the usa , he 'd be full of lead . 
  as in the case here ? 
  he is alive and in hospital . 
  in the usa , he 'd be in a morgue . 
  probably one of those humanist extremists again ... 
  bela-what ? 
  i doubt they 'll ever follow up on a story , especially if it would endanger their world view . 
  you ca n't talk openly about that conspiracy in germany , though . 
  not even on social media . 
  and as usual , the msm are in bed with the government to cover up things . 
  nice to see wapo has accepted russia 's annexation of crimea ... 
  as a precaution in case of a putsch or civil war . 
  the hope was that either the legitimate government could flee and use the stash to buy ammo and weapons or a exile government could be established . 
  i would n't be surprised if it also was an allied demand to have something i hand in case germany ever turned against nato . 
  if the cold war would have gotten hot , it would n't have mattered much where the gold was stored , there would n't have been a germany after . 
  the bundesregierung had enough means to balance the imports . 
  lowering the vat again would have a strong effect on consumption and with the current positive budget would be very affordable . 
  indeed , the vat was raised back when germany had a deficit , there is no reason to keep it that high forever . 
  pay rises for civil servants and other public employees would also stimulate demand . 
  as germany 's wages are rather low compared to our economic performance . 
  higher wages for public employees have a knock-on effect for wars in general , which raises consumption and lowers our competitiveness , thus balancing trade . 
  sch\u00e4uble is n't daft , he knows this , but chooses to blame the ecb only , because he hates their support for the club med countries and he has a hard-on for paying back the deficit . 
  look at mr. croatia here - just arrived in the eu , but still waving around his dagger like a good balkanite . 
   what about belgium ? 
  what about spain with catalan ?
