  so fucking what ? 
  i was * not * defending russia or the ussr . 
  i was talking about how the gl\u00f6rious us of a fucked up : `` your mistake was first propping up that asshole and when he had expired his usefulness , invaded and probably killed more civilians than saddam . '', 
  stop moving the fucking goal posts . 
  your fucking dimwitted approach at first propping up that monster , than toppling him and then sneaking away is not excused by likewise moronic actions by the hands of russia . 
  yeah , it 's not like we ca n't make it worse . 
  are we somehow obliged to police the world now ? 
  something hitler so we have to bring order and cleanliness to everywhere ? 
  wait , you simply ignore that your country turned a blind eye and supported him actively ? 
  idk , man . 
  that sounds a lot like the `` white man 's burden '' to civilize the world and bring the light to the barbarians . 
  i am not sure we would even have had the troubles with isis or in afghanistan without the us 's idea to police the world . 
  i downvoted shit , you are simply wrong . 
  your country is a prime example : happy when it can call on others to defend it , happy to get money and donated tanks from germany , but god forbid germany wants poland to do anything . 
  instant `` muh sovereignty '', 
  uh hu : - [ evidence suggests that saddam was on the cia payroll as early as 1959 , when he participated in a failed assassination attempt against iraqi strongman abd al-karim qassem . 
  in the 1980s , the us and britain backed saddam in the war against iran , giving iraq arms , money , satellite intelligence , and even chemical & bio-weapon precursors . 
  as many as 90 us military advisors supported iraqi forces and helped pick targets for iraqi air and missile attacks .

  because nato is ( or is supposed to be ) a purely * defensive * alliance which i am completely cool with . 
  one for all and all for one . 
  that 's different from bombing faraway countries into submission . 
  germany entered into a huge-ass gas deal during cold war , and the soviets never abused their power . 
  i do n't see why russia would be happy to burn one of their most important relationships . 
  your mistake was first propping up that asshole and when he had expired his usefulness , invaded and probably killed more civilians than saddam . 
  and to top it off , tuck tail and leave the population to the wolves . 
  iraq was a shit-show from start to end , in the same scale as vietnam . 
  every time germany tries to show leadership in somewhat controversial issues , all the other european countries bitch about the fourth reich . 
  you ca n't lead if no one follows . 
  it is , because there is absolutely no need for it , it is basically just throwing money at u.s. defense companies so the small-handed guy shuts up . 
  who really needs a big german army , either here or in our neighborhood ? 
  do n't invade us again , please ... 
  yep , the battle theater would be ukraine or poland now . 
  and has the money to do so . 
  why do we have to engage in gun-boat diplomacy just because the other cool kids do so ? 
  `` taking our place in the world '' is just an euphemism - germany does take a place in lots of international affairs , just not in the invasion business . 
  i distinctly remember 2003 . 
  it was pure hell even in germany . 
  hard to get any work done - ca n't imagine what it must have been like in the south . 
  agendas like furthering european integrating ? 
  yeah , kohl would have hated that . 
  if that building has indeed 120 flats as reported , then a number of 500 to 600 residents seems plausible . 
  the fire started on the 4th floor ( of 24 ) in the dead of the night at around 1am - so except for some night-shift workers , you 'd expect everyone to be in the building and sleeping . 
  so , that 's pretty much the worst case - fire breaks out in the night in one of the lower floors . 
  that does n't necessarily mean we will see three-digit numbers of victims ( fire alarms were at least partly working ) , but i would n't be surprised at all .

  actually , mixed-gender patrols have less incidents of officers getting hurt than male only , so it makes perfect sense , even though it 's not the original reason . 
  oh , my bad , how could i miss that ? 
  putting things this way of course makes it much better !, 
  now , instead of insulting 80m people , you insult 440m . 
  i also seem to recall you called the eu ( and i quote here ) `` 4th german reich '' . 
  so kindly bugger off with your attempts to sweet-talk your insults . 
  one is banter that 's based on an internet meme . 
  the other is extreme and uncalled-for rudeness . 
  instrumentalizing the past of my country against the current version as a cheap stab is an asshole move . 
  truly believing current germany is a 3 ^ rd reich reincarnation is a sign of a feeble mind , so pick one . 
  as a brit , i would expect you to at least recognize politeness , civility and its boundaries and stop short of blanket insults , but seems that 's no longer a given . 
  well , the bitterness and butthurt [ seem to exist on both sides ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gofhq/giant_theresa_may_sculpture_on_the_cliffs_of/disi62m/ ) ... 
  it was donated by france and is called the `` statue of idiocy '' , 
  idk , typhoon was a very expensive disaster , a400 as well . 
  i 'd rather not have to pay for something like that again , just so airbus can make big money . 
  still , the cover is pretty tired and somewhat insensitive , could have been bild . 
  that wagon would have been way too loaded to sign anything there . 
  besides , why should two democratic and peaceful countries use this symbol of domination and humiliation ? 
  signing big treaties in small dutch or belgian towns makes much more sense - or if both countries have a desire to do it with fanfare , germany should sign it in the french parliament and france countersign in berlin . 
  actually , i miss the couple of times when the french and german parliament were in joint session , [ last in 2103 ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-and-french-lawmakers-convene-on-elysee-anniversary/a-16542740?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf ) . 
   it works because your kids are old enough to understand . 
  fair point , they were born old enough . 
  strangely enough , telling our kids which parts of the flat are dangerous ( like the oven ) and having an eye on what they do has worked wonders . 
  if you want to slap your kid instead of reasoning with them , it shows you are stressed out and tired . 
  just when it started to get funny ... 
  how is this not forbidden all over europe ? 
  yeah , same here . 
  you are n't allowed to bitchslap your spouse , i do n't see why you should be allowed to do the same to your kids . 
  i sure as hell are n't going to beat my daughters . 
  it 's not like jews had been hated for centuries during times where religion was the normative moral framework ... 
  would someone kindly explain to me how le pen would not be ** objectively ** worse ? 
  i hope and pray he 'll retire , but the bundestagswahl is in september and macron better have some success stories till then . 
  you did it !, 
  thank 's a lot , 
  defend the eu if it gets trash-talked . 
  not just defend it , but show your conviction . 
  private citizens can do only so much to influence world politics . 
  what we can do is openly embrace what we believe is right and defend it . 
  i hope he can stand his ground against sch\u00e4uble and still work with germany to help adapt the eu to modern times . 
  thanks , french-bro 's , 
   how exactly will macron 's presidency solve the issues that eu has ? 
  it does n't . 
  but there 's some hope he will be able to work with other eu members to stabilize the eu first and help it evolve later . 
  it 's not like it was invented in europe , or something ... 
  polling stations close at 19:00 , so they sample a couple of representative polling stations and do projections . 
  the official result will be in tomorrow , iirc . 
  the funny thing is that that kind of `` loans '' from am enemy power would land you in jail in russia . 
  but of course , that 's different , because . 
  so buying politicians is an investment now ? 
  i guess , viewed from your country you could call bribes investments ... 
  who cares anymore ? 
  you ca n't make russia moderate by being nice - the last 20 years are proof of this .
