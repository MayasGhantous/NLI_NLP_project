  i think outlawed billboard ads for tobacco , but i am unsure . 
  that 's just low . 
  it 's something the americans do . 
  which we * also * did not sell . 
  come on , get real . 
  yes , germany is selling dual-use goods worldwide . 
  spinning this into `` germany delivered weapons to salafists '' is just extremely biased . 
  you do n't have a case , just knock it off . 
  it 's not . 
  walk into your next rossmann or aldi and grab a pay-as-you-go package . 
  i still do n't see where germany sold weapons to syrian rebels or assad . 
  or 250 ** million ** ... 
   if i recall well they were part of the coalition that bombed libya what the hell ?

  source ? 
  angela is now the queen of hearts in europe / s, 
  imperialistic countries never consider second-round effects of their gun-boat politics . 
  others can foot the bill . 
  wait a minute , germany had nothing to do with bombing the shit out of iraq , syria , or libya . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  of course it would be a perfectly fine country * for a westener * . 
  hell , i have been there a couple of times and it was beautiful . 
  we are talking refugees and xenophobia here . 
  the situation for gypsies and refugees is just shit .

  she should have been if the boy was charged ... 
  in the whole of western europe , only maybe greece would have a problem feeding , clothing and housing refugees . 
  how has ireland nothing to give ? 
  the netherlands ? 
  eastern europe is not a safe place for people with darkish skin . 
  germany has extremely low unemployment compared to about every other country in europe . 
  everyone with half a brain fleeing from a war like da'esh is waging will be looking for a medium to long-term perspective . 
  at the very least , you want education for your children and some hope of a job or social security . 
  not to bash hungarians , but hungary is not a very nice country currently - and if i were a refugee i 'd be very afraid what 's going on there in maybe 10 years time . 
  they are not dumb , they have heard about orban . 
   refugees are welcomed but they should n't have claims besides security/food/healthcare / roof on top of their heads . 
  we tried that and it does not work so well . 
  people who are bored will turn criminal or a nuisance . 
  it 's much better to make them learn the local language , educate them and where possible offer jobs ( i know , that 's easier said than done in most countries ), 
  it 's not like those are final numbers . 
  first , it 's not actual applications , but people who could apply for asylum . 
  then the rate of successful applications is somewhere between 25 and 30 % if memory serves . 
  of the rest , some end up in kind of limbo because they ca n't be repatriated , but a whole lot will be gone in a year or two . 
  depends . 
  we took on loads of `` boat people '' from vietnam in the 1980 's who started restaurants and food shops and worked as drivers . 
  today , their success in higher education is better than the german average , and they or their parents were fished from the sea with just their clothes on . 
  if the current crop from syria will do as well remains to be seen , but one thing western europe provides is chances in education and a basic social security . 
  it 's a bit similar , but on a lesser scale in germany . 
  there never ( to the best of my knowledge ) outright racist comments like cockroaches , but starting in early summer , the papers certainly have changed their point of view to stress we are dealing with a humanitarian crisis and need to act . 
   but almost the entire populace is against it . 
  that 's not true at all , at least in germany . 
  a lot of people have some reservations ( understandably ) , but when 2,500 refugees arrived in munich and the local police asked for donations , they had to ask people to stop donating on the very same day because they were drowning in blankets , teddy bears and beverages . 
   that 's already underage . 
  and of course underage boys will normally not take nude selfies ... 
  thanks  in fact i am glad i do n't have to do the job of the mods . 
  but yeah , i am happy to make / r/europe a bit better . 
   imo your tool should be linked in the sidebar , fixed flairs are less flexible . 
  good idea . 
  in fact the mods could take the code and use it with only very slight modifications so that not everyone has to install greasemonkey first . 
  it 's under a very liberal license . 
  btw : you can use comma-separated terms in the filter definition line , no need to have one button for each word - in case you missed that , 
   for example , i have heard many parts of paris now , is like being in an african country . 
  maybe you should come over and see how the reality is , 
  yes , but if you install [ the filter plugin i wrote ] ( https://github.com/isnow/reuropefiltered ) , things get better : http://imgur.com/izqu70i, 
  compassion and the idea that [ article 14 of the declaration of human rights ] ( http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a14 ) actually means something . 
  also the idea that europe , as one of the richest regions on the planet , has the moral obligation to do something and not let people drown in scores at their borders . 
  it has kind of a tradition . 
  in the 1980 's , loads of `` boat people '' from vietnam came , in the 1990 's it was native germans and jews from russia and people from the balkans . 
  even later , it were gypsies from eastern europe . 
  that kid that drowned in turkey and is now making waves , his family wanted to go to ... canada and were rejected . 
  just saying , sorry . 
   how is it hypocritical ? 
  starts right at the headline :  europe is facing a moral crisis the whole world is facing a moral crisis over that , eh ? 
  it 's not like we europeans have somehow created that crisis down there . 
   we will have to give up some bank regulations for europe to accept this treaty do n't ... 
  it 's a mess over here . 
  i mean it could be because isis and the war down there is a very real and concrete and deadly problem and germany recognizes this . 
  or maybe art14 of the human rights declaration ? 
   europe is mishandling it , badly . 
  while there is some truth to it , reading this from a canadian paper is mind-blowing . 
  that 's the epitome of hypocrisy . 
   in july 2013 , jason kenney , then minister of citizenship and immigration , committed to resettling 1,300 syrian refugees by the end of 2014 -- 200 through direct government assistance and 1,100 through private sponsorship ( a practice that generally involves church groups and other religious organizations ) . 
  not until march 2015 was the 1,300 mark -- an astonishingly paltry target -- reached . 
   this january , chris alexander , kenney 's ministerial successor , announced that canada would resettle 10,000 syrians by the end of 2017 , again primarily through private sponsorship . 
  on monday , stephen harper vowed to add a further 10,000 over the next four years [ source ] ( http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/08/12/on-syrian-refugee-crisis-canada-failing-miserably.html ) so canada is taking up what ... 25,000 refugees from there . 
  how charitable . 
  i know the freedom my grandpa fought and died for was the freedom to shoot russians , mistreat polish and kill jews . 
  it 's beyond me how you torture that paper that proposes considerable wage increases to support your claim the populace has become poorer since 1990 . 
  - [ german real wages post strongest rise on record in q1 ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/02/germany-economy-wages-idusl8n0zi1ib20150702 ) - [ workers in germany earned more in real terms in the first quarter of 2015 than at any time since 2008 ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germany-sees-big-rise-in-real-earnings-as-inflation-stagnates/a-18557456 ) - [ wages in europe 's largest economy rose by 2.5 % from the first quarter of 2014 , in real or price-adjusted terms ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/german-real-wage-gains-hit-highest-on-record-2015-07-02 ) time to catch up with reality , buddy . 
  additionally , the unemployment rate is way lower than 1990 , so the general public is much better off . 
   `` menschenverachtung , '' meaning roughly `` contempt for humankind , '' a word that is unique to the german language and a discipline of thought this country has excelled at in the past -- and not only under the nazi regime . 
  i do n't get this tendency to always remind everyone at every opportunity of our darkest past . 
  hate speech and the hatred of other groups is nothing particular to germany . 
  i know where i 'll spend my next holidays !, 
  that 's sexual exploitation of minors / s, 
  currently , the will to help is overwhelming , on the other hand there are more arson attacks against shelters . 
  interestingly , our media has stopped bashing refugees as they did earlier and have switched to a `` we can do it ! '', 
  attitude . 
  how long that will be kept up remains to be seen , however . 
  i dread winter - people get more gloomy and horror stories will be reported more , i think .
