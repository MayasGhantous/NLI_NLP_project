   those that want asylum would apply at the processing centers in their respective countries i am not sure if a war region is the best place to erect consulates and have hundreds of thousands of people waiting for their asylum application to pass , but maybe i misunderstand the concept of war . 
  the idea would work in countries where there 's not war and prosecution , but not for people who 'd claim asylum but ordinary migration . 
   while ensuring fairness and balance between all eu members so that the burden is shared among all members . 
  i am sure the brits will be delighted . 
  their burden-sharing is legendary  this would provide zero incentive for illegal immigration and provide a strong incentive for legal immigration that can be monitored and controlled . 
  the incentive is still there for those who 'd not get asylum or a work permit . 
  oh yes , please . 
  if only because it will cause insane amounts of frustration in moscow . 
  i am pretty sure now the site is created by artificial intelligence scripts ( no joke ) . 
  that quote from the 11 most racist countries in europe really takes the cake :  often referred to as `` the land of the free '' germany is pretty racist when it comes to americans and english speaking people . 
  it might not reflect politically but it is true . 
  i know i have heard `` the land of the free '' in relation to * some other * country , i just have a hard time remembering exactly which one . 
  or that quote :  in sweden you are 50 % more likely to get an interview call if you have a spanish sounding name . 
  that 's just how racist swedes are . 
  all that beautiful clay could be ours : / seriously , that 's extremely exciting . 
  i often wondered how the landscape looked back then - there must have been a huge-ass river with the thames and the seine as tributaries ( maybe even the rhine as well , i ca n't recall ) flowing through what today is the channel . 
  good guy austria !, 
  so , what 's taking you so long ? 
  i whipped this up in a couple hours . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
  the whole site consists of `` the top xx of ... '' , click-bait from beginning to end . 
  especially coming from a top-ranking politician . 
  that 's not some uneducated grandpa grumbling . 
  that 's a really low quality article . 
  their sources are something like :  brussels is a city in belgium with a population of 177,300 people . 
  the city does not seem to have a very good reputation and is considered as one of the most racist cities in europe due to several reports on tourists getting unjust treatment . 
  you fool , i am not even leftist . 
  i constantly get flak from both extremes of the spectrum . 
  if you define the right filter terms ... 
  that 's not how it works . 
  if a community is a happy ship , people interact a lot . 
  if a community is in crisis , people withdraw ( vote with their feet ) . 
  great to hear , 
  heh , then you have defined too many filters or one that is too broad , 
   could the filter keywords be made regexable ? 
  ( have n't looked at source yet ) easily . 
  i have n't quite made up my mind if regex are the way to go ( probably ) or a different notation [ like i asked over in / r/javascript ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3ihup0/looking_for_a_js_library_for_advanced_text/ ) . 
  just replace the substring regeex in line 188 , remove the tolowercase in line 186 and 95 so your regex would not be downcased and you are golden . 
   the problem lies more in positive claims than normative ones . 
  people are more focused on their ideals than factual data in asserting in what state europe is in right now . 
  alarmist articles and comments rule the sub at the moment , but how do you filter that without creating a problem of bias ? 
  there always will be corner cases and with a diverse mod team , those will be resolved better or worse . 
  even intelligent people seem to have a problem understanding that if a post of theirs gets removed , it 's not the end of the world . 
  having been active on * chans really helped me to not get my panties in a bunch any more , i think . 
  currently , however , it 's not about corner cases , currently it 's about racists and their moronic followers shouting down every dissenting opinion . 
  and that needs swift and draconic intervention till people start to think about shit they write , * before * they write it . 
  i think the mod team is too inexperienced to understand that in large and diverse communities the mods will be hated constantly by about 10-20 % of users and those constantly cause a big stink . 
  banning them helps , but the times of letting things find their course are over . 
   looks clean enough to be adapted for other subs with little hassle . 
  it * should * work on other subs , the only modification would be adding more @include lines at the top : / / @include http://*.reddit.com/r/worldnews/* / / @include https://*.reddit.com/r/worldnews/* / / @include http://*.reddit.com/r/europe/* / / @include https://*.reddit.com/r/europe/* the defined filters would be applied in every sub though . 
   it would be nice if `` filter color '' had a drop down menu/popup with a list of colors or even better a clickable palette , or at least an explanation/example on how to insert a color ( #blue , #ffffff ) true , i replaced the text field with a color picker . 
  you might need to update or reinstall . 
  you are welcome , 
  and it seems the next crisis is following right on it 's heels ... 
  - austria is dependent on tourism and with the current economical situation , that sector is not exactly exploding - weak growth in eastern europe and sanctions against russia - for years , there has been too little investment and unit labor costs are rising - they have a big competitor right at their borders which is picking up steam . 
  it 's a combination of a lot of small causes . 
  oh , nice , thanks , 
   i feel for the mods , they are held the sword of damocles aka `` free speech '' above their heads every time they want to regulate discussion in comments yes , but this is where they need to take a stand . 
  you ca n't please all people , you have to live with hatred if you are modding such a large subreddit . 
  inaction means also taking a stand - letting the better part of their users down and encouraging the xenophobes and racists . 
  i did n't even have to read the article to know the guy would be 1 . from bavaria 2 . from the csu, 
   hall-smith has been chasing the trains since 1993 , visiting 41 ghost stations . 
  moralee has visited 32 . 
  they take pictures at each one and try to put them on their website , with detailed descriptions about how to get there and what to expect . 
  to celebrate his 50th birthday , they went to berney arms in norfolk . 
  `` it has to be one of the maddest places we have both been to , '' he says . 
  `` no words can describe how isolated this place was . '' the closest road was three miles away ; the only nearby structures were a shuttered pub and an old windmill . 
  somebody should tell the guy that jain is no longer ceo . 
  that just makes it clear you need an invasion to get your infrastructure back on track . 
  efficiency and w\u00f6rk !, 
  does n't mean the discussion has to drown everything else . 
  ca n't you see that people leave if the subreddit turns from a well-behaved community into a racist shit-fest ? 
  if you do n't weed out , there 'll be a negative selection . 
   you know what does work , though ? 
  outright deleting submissions and banning users this ever so much . 
  btw , it is called ** moderating a subreddit ** , not letting it slide into shit . 
  who cares , you are just asking for tanks passing through !, 
   bribes are the lubricant of german engineering . 
  i doubt it is still true . 
  took us till [ 1998 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gesetz_zur_bek%c3%a4mpfung_internationaler_bestechung ), 
  all that in conjunction with your username creates unsavory images ... 
   either way , if an environment within a country is conducive to accepting bribes , a party willing to bribe will always win . 
  that 's a sad truth . 
  coming from one of the industrial powerhouses of the world , i still believe that countries like the us or germany ( or france ... ) should lead the pack by enforcing stiff penalties both for companies headquartered on their soil and their leadership . 
  that drives up the costs of doing corrupt business and thereby balances the scales somewhat . 
  the downside of course is that our industry will not get some contracts , but that 's a price we should pay - in the end , corrupt business corrupts both parties . 
  germany was a tad late to the party outlawing bribery abroad . 
  and i have been at siemens back then , they did turn a blind eye . 
  then they got caught and got raped royally , serves them right . 
  big french companies like alsthom of course still do that kind of thing ... 
  still , that needs to stop . 
  it damages the societies of developing countries . 
  back then , germany even had a rule where you could deduct bribes in foreign countries from tax as costs of doing business . 
  that rule is long gone , of course , but that just added fuel to the fire . 
  that was an absolute shit show back then . 
  it 's good greece is investigating this - just sad 15 years had to pass for anything moving forward . 
   also keep in mind that the goal of the european union and the un at this point is to destroy current european societies . 
  omg , do people really deep down believe shit like that ? 
  you ca n't really be * that * daft ? 
   followers of islam believe they are the only righteous people on earth , and the only ones who have access to higher truths .
