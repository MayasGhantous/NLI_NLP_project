  there are ocr programs that make a more or less good job translating if you just point your smartphone at something written . 
  and if you really need to be in a country with a different alphabet more often , you will pick up that alphabet . 
  so , no . 
  everyone should have english starting in primary school , that would be much more valuable . 
  wait , wait , that will still take a couple of years . 
  currently , it 's just a forum on the internet that thinks you are awesome , 
   romania is not , afaik singled out as being a ` shit ' country by the rest of europe . 
  are you sure ? 
  the country definitely has a bad rap in germany , partly because after 1989 , a lot of ethnic germans that had lived there as a minority came over and of course were not really fond of the country they just had left . 
  partly because gypsies are not well liked over here and are associated with romania . 
  however , especially in the sibiu region ( where the native germans lived in the past ) , quite some big german companies have opened fabrication plants , and german investments are the third largest or so among all foreign direct investments . 
  i hope and trust this will lead to more exchange and that over the next couple of years could correct the romanian image over here . 
  well thanks for doing something good for a country that is not your own . 
  i must say that what gets posted on this sub about romania has indeed given me a much more favorable view of that country . 
  i guess it 's to early to declare romania is out of the doghouse , * but * things certainly seem to improve over there . 
  fingers crossed there is no backlash or accident that negates all the progress . 
  here 's to you guys , i keep my fingers crossed you make it into the league of countries where corruption is low , governmental practices are fair and the standards of living are improving for most , not just as mall minority . 
   so ultimately , german `` leadership '' comes down to finding a solution that all memberstates can somehow agree with while also not forcing a grexit . 
  that 's not the worst kind of leadership , really . 
  german communications strategy would have been better served if it had repeated again and again that no , the ez is not a federal republic with the power balance such a country usually has . 
  and no , it does not have budget oversight with fangs . 
  and no , just because it is an ambitious project , it is not a country like the usa . 
  and point out that under the given circumstances naive keynesianism has a * huge * moral hazard that would tear apart the emu really quickly . 
   you ca n't get a man to understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it . 
  that 's what they say about krugman ? 
  hm , there is deutsche welle with their dw.de , they have a lot of english content . 
  spiegel does a decent job of translating part of their content , but it 's still a small part . 
  and thelocal.de is pretty good in summarizing debates . 
  that works internally and it may still work in the eurogroup where each member knows every other . 
  it stops working if the imf is needed , as in the current crisis . 
  i think it was a clever move by germany to require the imf for the `` bailouts '' , to block anti-reform coalitions , but it has the side effect that a lot of money of countries outside the emu is at stake now . 
  and they are not too happy about it . 
  the worst about this is that i have grave doubts that berlin actually has a strategy . 
  if they took the lead and showed dominance because they had a plan , i would applaud . 
  but this third `` bailout '' is not a workable plan , it 's a disaster waiting to happen . 
  it reeks of showing greece who 's the boss around here and not much else . 
  now we have openly hostile asshats like piketty and ignoramuses like krugman constantly bombarding public opinion with concepts that are unworkable either , but sound good - especially to an electorate that has to foot the bill only in a marginal sense . 
  goes to show what germany needs to learn if we want to become a somewhat more global player : prepare your talking points early and hammer them home again and again . 
   cultural marxists could you stop with that breivik-bullshit right now , please ? 
  others are skeptical too : http://theaviationist.com/2015/08/08/have-indian-su-30s-really-dominated-raf-typhoons-in-aerial-combat-with-a-12-0-scoreline-most-probably-not/, 
  no , good times to be in nato . 
  [ this ] ( http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2001/09/25/0001_type82912type82914_138535.shtml ) was just a lie , though . 
  i fail to see how this macro sorcery of yours contradicts anything i wrote . 
  yes , the ecb has the job of preserving the eur and currently sees it fit to devaluate the eur like the club med central banks regularly did in the past . 
  this is in no way in germany 's interest , it creates bubbles and exploding export surplus over here - so it 's squarely aimed at propping up the flagging economies enough to tide them over a couple of years . 
  i am not blaming them for anything , although i am not too happy with this `` beggar thy neighbor '' policy . 
  oh shit , that is such a great and sad letter ... 
  o bestow thy superior knowledge on us mere mortals then !, 
  qe , ever heard about that ? 
  the article was about the * current * german trade surplus though , not about the history of the ez . 
  so looking at the last couple of years is indefinitely more worthwhile than looking at 15 years back . 
  also , i have yet to see someone from the peripheral countries condemn the current `` beggar thy neighbor '' policy enacted by the ecb . 
  that kind of politics seems only bad if germany does it ... 
  well , i am in the good company of krugman if i say the setup of the ez is flawed . 
  only he used it to go on a moralistic rant against germany and in defense of the peripherals . 
  but since the ecb has switched to propping up the peripheral 's economy , the problems start with the stronger economies . 
  having a war on two fronts was not so bright either . 
  or overstretching the occupied territory ridiculously . 
  or neglecting defense technology ( radar , anti-aircraft missiles , single-role fighters ) and only push offensive tech ( abusing fighter planes as bombers ), 
  well , then we have to disagree here unless you can show me how germany took away market-share from other ez countries . 
  it does not make sense to me . 
  uhm , you can blame the ecb for that . 
  their financial policy today is such a misfit for germany as it was in the 2000 's for the peripherals . 
  reading is not your best strength , right ? 
  but reading your posting history , i am surprised you understand enough to even find reddit . 
  not that clown again . 
  look , he presents data ** from 2000 till 2014 ** - everyone knows there was a slump in german labor costs in the early 2000 's due to late effects of unification , i present data ** from 2012 ** onwards to tell you ** that this slump has ended ** . 
  is that really so hard to understand ? 
  krugman is harping on based on a completely flawed data selection - one that ( purposely or not ) makes germany look bad . 
   then by the same token you could take global trade surplus to infer that germany does have an advantage on a global scale against other ez countries no , from that you can infer that germany is living in a currency union where the external value of that currency is too low , relative to germany 's competitiveness in comparison to eg . 
  the usa or china . 
  then the ecb are the ones breaking rules here . 
  lowering the external value of the eur * will * lead to export surplus in the strong countries , there is nothing mystical or specially german about that . 
  the german gov ' t can hardly fight the ecb on that . 
  then please explain to me how a country that is more or less at equilibrium with the other ez countries ( ie . 
  no extremely high competitiveness advantage ) can outcompete them on the international market at will . 
   wages virtually at the same level for 10 + years yeah right : - http://www.rttnews.com/2475129/german-real-wage-growth-biggest-since-2008.aspx - nominal wage growth in germany was 2.5 percent in 2012 , 1.9 percent in 2013 , and 2.8 percent in 2014 , which was above the euro area average for all years . 
  in terms of real wages , growth in germany was above euro area average only in 2014 . 
  ( http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1532-is-low-inflation-translating-into-lower-wage-growth-in-germany-already/ ), 
   german wages have not seen virtually any growth in that time frame either .

  ( http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1532-is-low-inflation-translating-into-lower-wage-growth-in-germany-already/ ), 
  does not make much sense - the prices of other ez exporters are also depressed due to the low eur, 
   if germany takes over to much of the exports from within the eurozone to the outside , then it amounts to cannibalization of the market . 
  i do n't buy this . 
  germany is competing with other ez countries internally to the ez and externally on the same footing ( eur value ) . 
  if germany has not much of a trade surplus internally , i do n't see where the huge advantage externally would come from . 
  but do you know germany has next to no surplus against ez countries ? 
  do n't take my word for it : http://www.forbes.com/sites/raoulruparel/2015/04/09/bernanke-gets-it-wrong-on-germanys-trade-surplus/ a surplus against countries outside the ez is not nice , but does not endanger eurozone stability . 
  to a certain extend , that would not be necessary - eg . 
  germany could lower vat to stimulate domestic demand which would increase imports and rebalance the trade surplus . 
  however , as long as the ecb punishes the eur exchange rate as it does , that wo n't effect all that much . 
  yes , it is one of the best political speeches in german , ever . 
  i know when i first read it in full , i got all salty . 
  it 's a council called [ bpjm ] ( http://www.bundespruefstelle.de/bpjm/service/english.html ) that is on the hunt for material that is `` ethically damaging '' to minors and regularly overstretches its mandate to in effect censor media . 
  even their own censorship index is censored and only available to journalists . 
  its `` board of 12 '' has two seats reserved for both major christian churches . 
  i got that . 
  i was pointing out what the * current * german majority thinks , which is very different from what people * back then * felt .
