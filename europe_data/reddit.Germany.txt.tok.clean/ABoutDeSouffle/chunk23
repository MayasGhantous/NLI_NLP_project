  i understand a dedicated whistleblower law is some years in the making but not yet implemented . 
  however , informers working for journalists are especially protected by \u00a7 53 abs . 
  5 stpo ( criminal code ) and there 's a ecthr decision protecting them . 
  civil servants ( `` beamte '' ) have a duty to blow the whistle on a couple of crimes and there 's some protection based on ecthr heinisch v. germany and guja v. moldova for other employees . 
  merge everything into the netherlands . 
  they are basically the dominant country there , so they could rule the rest just as well . 
  dat nose ... 
  well yes , let 's do it again with refugees from africa and the middle east and see if there 's still a net benefit ... 
  i find that a bit doubtful because range has explicitly ruled out surveillance against beckedahl , but i am no lawyer ... 
  that 's a strange end to a muddled affair . 
  range has a point that sacking high-ranking civil servants like the attorney general over a disagreement is unusual and stinks . 
  otoh , i do n't quite understand how he could mishandle the netzpolitik.org disclosure like he did - starting an investigation that obviously has no merit stinks . 
  the only explanation i can think of is trying to scare both netzpolitik and its informers . 
  the only winner is the freedom of the press - and that 's a good thing overall . 
  president is a pastor , so probably you 'd get the 20 $ . 
  same with merkel , she 's a pastor 's daughter . 
  sch\u00e4uble on the other hand ... 
  probably the greens . 
  they are currently the only viable more-or-less liberal party in germany . 
  they have the right ideas about the eu and internet freedom . 
  although my ideas about immigrations do n't really line up with theirs . 
  and their blanket ban on any modern technology makes me sick . 
  more in all likelihood . 
  and '92 was a massive crisis over here that lead to much tighter rules on asylum , a mild domestic crisis and the rise of right-wing parties . 
  it 's no coincidence that the dublin regulation was signed around the refugee crisis of the early 90 's, 
  i 'd be thrilled if it would become a reality , but i believe technology can only enter a exponential growth path if there is something that can be improved and made cheaper very much by economics of scale ( eg . 
  photolitho and cpu designs or conveyor belt car production ) . 
  i doubt that would work so well for something that would burn a hell of a lot of fuel for a small passenger cabin and would have terrible maintenance costs due to three different engine-types . 
  i 'd say this is a defensive `` just in case '' patent , not something airbus is actively researching . 
  i do n't doubt it 's technologically sound , it 's just not economically viable . 
  that thing would be a maintenance nightmare . 
  others want asylum seeker 's teeth kicked in . 
  that 's the stuff civil wars are made of . 
  birth right , it 's in the german constitution . 
  but aussiedlers were ordinary migrants , not refugees , including them in the chart is intellectually dishonest . 
  back then we had [ 1.5 m migrants ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/societystate/population/migration/tables_/lrbev07.html ) of which were roughly 400k refugees . 
  now we are looking at at least 400k , more likely 500k refugees . 
  anyone just stop pretending this is not a historic peak , the facts are stacked against you . 
  ah , very good . 
  constructing the european global bomber in disguise of a passenger jet  seriously , this got ta be freaking expensive . 
  i ca n't see this materializing , not with 3 types of engine and liquid h2 stored aboard . 
  edit : [ i 'll just leave this here ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silbervogel ), 
  nope , they are too productive and efficient , 
  just to put that lying with statistics into historical perspective , the expected number for 2015 is at least [ 400,000 ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-being-tested-by-huge-refugee-influx-a-1045560.html ) . 
  to give you another data point why this is causing problems , pick the date of the [ rostock-lichtenhagen riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rostock-lichtenhagen_riots ) and match it to the graph . 
  funny how that fits , huh ? 
  in fact that were not riots but attempted mass murder and it is n't funny . 
  half a million refugees are way too many and if the trend continues into 2016 , we 'll see murders . 
  ethnic germans who had lived in russia or other eastern countries moving to the ` fatherland ` . 
  example : [ banat swabians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banat_swabians ), 
  his opinion differs from yours , it 's called democracy . 
  it ca n't .

  why is this on / r/europe ? 
   as opposed to western europe , where gypsies become bankers and it specialists ? 
  do n't believe me , just watch [ what the bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18665919 ) has to say . 
  or you could read up on [ the eu press release ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-13-610_en.htm ) :  the report draws attention to a series of good practice examples from the member states , such as the regional action plan for roma inclusion developed by the state of berlin . 
  but yeah , just because we do n't have jobs as it-specialists for them , it 's not different here [ than for example there ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/the-new-roma-ghettos-000519-v20n4 ) , right ? 
  well ... 
  i think there 's more to it . 
  i do n't know if the prejudice against gypsies are deserved to the full extend , but it seems pretty clear to me that in a lot of countries they do n't really get the same chances as others . 
  they are fleeing in droves from the east to western countries because the conditions in their home countries are something like low-level ethnic cleansing . 
  i thought it was about the budget not some incoherent rambling about the soviet bloc . 
  i guess you are one of those who have a hard time writing eu instead of eussr ... 
   losing # how-ever-many-billion the uk contributes will cause massive cuts and cancellations . 
  well yes , but france or germany wo n't have to pick up the tab - it 's basically bad news for greece and poland . 
  what i mean is : brits typically point to the billions upon billions they transfer which in reality are pretty low . 
  if the uk payed as much as france per capita , the loss would mean crisis . 
   when you are supposed to do the opposite and put it lower i can see where you are coming from - the same applies to refugees from the middle east or africa which have not been brought up in societies comparable to the ones in western europe . 
  and many of which are traumatized . 
  i hear the same is true for gypsies . 
  the problem is , this wo n't fly with the native population . 
  they feel they have a right to feel safe in their home countries , to not become the targets of pickpockets and robbers . 
  they want their societies to provide the same level of education they enjoyed . 
  and frankly i do n't really see why people should be held to a lower standard than everyone else . 
  that discourages them from trying to achieve something and makes them less than a full citizen with all rights and obligations . 
  so how 's the history of states seceding from the eu ? 
   mentioning capita contributions is irrelevant what a load of hogwash , per capita is what influences the financial load of each citizen . 
  you got ta be kidding me . 
  i find that wholly unconvincing . 
  the [ ecb mandate ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/strategy/pricestab/html/index.en.html ) is for `` inflation rates of below , but close to , 2 % '' . 
  if the german angst of hyperinflation leads to a target inflation rate of 1.8 -.1.9 % instead of 1.9-2 .1 % then i do n't think it 's a big deal . 
  and the ecb has vowed to `` do what it takes '' to save the eur and currently is embarking on a lot of ` exotic monetary policies ' . 
  give us a chance ... 
  huh , and the german influence even extends to the federal reserve , which incidentally has the same 2 % inflation target ? 
  that 's news to me . 
   the fomc implements monetary policy to help maintain an inflation rate of 2 percent over the medium term . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm ), 
  quick ( no googling ) , who said it :  mutual aid in the economic field and joint military defence must inevitably be accompanied step by step with a parallel policy of closer political unity . 
  it is said with truth that this involves some sacrifice or merger of national sovereignty . 
   never that it would lead to loss of sovereignty . 
  excuse me ? 
  you must have been sound asleep in school . 
  brits typically think this is an important point where it really is not . 
  receiver countries would get less while the additional costs for the net payers would be very limited . 
  i say : ask the canadians first !, 
  seriously , the chances are beyond slim , why would they want to join ?
