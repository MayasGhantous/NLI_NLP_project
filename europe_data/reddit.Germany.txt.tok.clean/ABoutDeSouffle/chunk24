  and i am not sure the eu is prepared for that - it is still a european organization . 
  once countries from outside europe join , it should think about becoming a global org . 
  the british contribution to the budget [ is not so very high ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union ) , per capita it is closer to greece than the netherlands . 
  i did n't say they do , did i ? 
  i would be really thankful if you would not cast the current actions of the german government in terms of something that happened 100 years ago . 
  german politics today is not seeing everything in terms of bread lines . 
   using nuclear weapon in london bullshit . 
  if anything it 's a [ radiological weapon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiological_weapon ) . 
  nukes typically mean thermonuclear devices - one would have been enough to finish off the whole of london , not just one guy . 
  way too little sleep due to kids . 
  being locked into the boredom of bigenterprise inc. 
  largely because anyone else went mia , really . 
  berlin until 3 years ago was never keen on having the say in europe without one or two bro 's sharing the responsibility . 
  pouting and withdrawing was a very dumb move on the side of the uk - now shit gets decided over here instead of in brussels or at least between paris , london and berlin . 
  uh , since when is the uk in the business of propping up a foreign hegemony ? 
  except from the us 's ... germany is less statist than france , so naturally people over here like the uk as a counterbalance . 
  slovakia , stop doing this !, 
  i had not idea , but it seems slovakia has been the leader in cars/capita [ since 2007 ] ( http://www.industryweek.com/global-economy/slovak-car-industry-production-almost-doubled-2007 ) . 
  and [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovakia#industry ) has to say this : there are currently three automobile assembly plants : volkswagen 's in bratislava , psa peugeot citro\u00ebn 's in trnava and kia motors ' \u017dilina plant . 
  uhm no ? 
  even if the british propensity to ask the tough questions at times gets on everyone 's nerves , it is a good thing at other times . 
  as long as the uk is not trying to sabotage the eu for national gains i want them to stay . 
  i do n't believe the eu has to define itself as a body in contradiction to the usa , that does not make a lot of sense and looking at how good the relationship between eu states and the us is , i certainly see no indication of it . 
  however , at some point , frictions will emerge between two powerful political entities , that 's just how human societies work . 
  not that i can see it coming , but if the eu ever gains more weight internationally , it will pursue its interest more powerfully , even if they cross the us occasionally . 
  the problem is that the us never had any need to deal with a rivaling power that is not an enemy but an ally or at least neutral but makes their own rule . 
  it 's incredibly unlikely ( there are * no * regular checks on german borders ) but if they find out ( or get tipped off by your home country ) , you will have to explain where the stuff comes from . 
  if you ca n't , you hd 's could afaik be confiscated . 
  just encrypt the disks and play dumb if they ask you questions . 
  most likely as long as the german state * gives * part of the vat to the ez finance minister , the budget prerogative of the bundestag is not violated . 
  if we ever move to a system where the ez can levy new taxes or controls the budget , a change in the constitution would be required . 
  they [ just love ] ( http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-93441-galleryv9-czzq.jpg ) to [ do this ] ( http://cdn4.spiegel.de/images/image-347867-panov9free-cmex.jpg ) to [ every politician ] ( http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-815965-panov9free-jgce.jpg ), 
   at the end of world war ii , a bloody horror that cost 80 million lives worldwide , american leaders were determined that germany must never again rise to massacre its neighbors . 
  oh wow , when an article starts like that , you know the dumb are coming out of hiding again . 
  except the turkish gov ' t is mortally afraid of a kurdish state anywhere because they would claim turkish territory and everyone knows it . 
  that 's why the turkish army delivered weapons to da'esh , and during the kobane siege closed the border . 
   somehow europe has to define itself in contradiction to the usa [ citation required ] . 
  i 'd really like to know where you take this from except from `` my personal opinion is teh lawz '', 
  all i can say , if you spy on us , do n't be surprised you get a lot of anti- * sentiment . 
  i can still think germany has been a great country over times , but i ca n't say i am proud of it . 
   every opinion is valid no matter how shitty it is . 
  yes , but not necessarily here . 
  if you want to go full retard , do it somewhere else . 
  i want a civilized subreddit where unintelligent , flamebaity , hateful or low-quality ( however defined ) content gets weeded out . 
  i 'd rather the mods err on the side of deleting too much than too little . 
  * ahem * partly . 
  and it 's probably obvious why not . 
  i like the german contribution to a modern university education , to arts , science and - in the last 60 years - to peace and lawful international relations . 
   people would quickly learn what goes and what does n't no . 
  for that you need to have a brutal ban-hammer and use it . 
  crowds do n't learn , they always try to push their agenda as long as the mods get flak both from the xenophobes and sjw 's , they do ok . 
  the good news is that this sub is far from being an echo-chamber . 
  not that again . 
  it 's the fucking duty of a mod team to weed out comments that lead to flame wars . 
  you both may as well stop , it 's our clay anyways, 
  a3xx was the code for the a380 . 
  furthermore , a patent does not mean they develop something like that . 
   whether articles it published earlier this year on plans to increase state surveillance of online communications are a revelation of state secrets . 
  that 's not what the definition of treason is in germany . 
  it needs to be that * and * aiding and abetting a foreign power or weakening germany 's position in the world . 
  yes , voicing serious concerns . 
  mutual defense up to a war is only required for nato art. 5, 
  depends what you mean exactly . 
  relative of mine is gay and has zero problems walking hand-in-hand or kissing - and they live in the most conservative part of bavaria . 
  i would n't dare to in the muslim-dominated parts of town though . 
  not joining nato is just dumb . 
  do n't come knocking if russia invades aaland . 
  not him of all people !, 
  you take this kind of maps too serious , i think , 
  seems they paused the prosecution for now : http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/generalbundesanwalt-stoppt-ermittlungen-gegen-netzpolitik-13728725.html, 
   i wonder what that would mean for the mods ? 
  same like everyone else : no more reddit , more productive at work . -, 
   i 'm not entirely sure what our rules are exactly and when time restricted access is sufficient , but i know it 's more than simply entering a fake date of birth . 
  in germany : either postid or credit card information . 
  not even id card number would do . 
  but : we do n't have national blocking policy , that 's what it makes different . 
  i thought you were the hat ? 
  but the eu = / = europe . 
   your wife comes from bosnia and car from germany !, 
  better than the other way round , 
  that 's what i was alluding to , 
  why ? 
  it will be interesting if this is the death of non-commercial porn in the uk - / r/gonewild or similar subreddits , each of the * chans or tumblr would have to be blocked too . 
   german house price statistics are weak . 
  france has very good statistics good only if you are not a family in the market for housing . 
  but you * are * known as the 51 ^ st state - no one ever told you ? 
  meh , the frogs bought out that one . 
  no more leopards , no more anschlussing of east europe ... 
  was hoping for something better than just `` car factory '' : /, 
  so , tu quoque ? 
  that 's really bad , actually it 's an attempt to silence those guys . 
  germany has no gag laws , so i guess they are trying that way . 
  netzpolitik is the leading german blog on politics , privacy and internet surveillance . 
  there has been hardly any treason investigation against journalists in the last 20 years or so on the basis of leaked documents . 
  i hope and trust nothing come off it , but if yes , it will be a disaster for investigative journalism . 
  [ exactly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omon ), 
  we were never visiting , we needed lebensraum !, 
  removings of \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i ... 
  there 's a lot of bantering and also heartfelt prejudices against almost every country . 
  germany typically gets a drubbing when it comes to european leadership or territorial integrity of countries .
