  the jokes about france are really tiring . 
  saw what , the omon-guy ? 
  he 's less baroque , so probably less so . 
  however , remember how he bitchslapped his speaker around because the guy did n't get some papers copied in time ? 
  i guess he 's even less of a nice person than kohl , just not that patronizing . 
  i am sure you have never heard or read something like `` shut up , you stupid cunt '' , sure ... , 
  meh , nothing is settled there . 
  it 's just a lull in the storm . 
  ugh , that would have me running to the toilet to clean out my underwear . 
  i could easily top that with a really nasty appeal to silence ... 
  taking the female sexual organ as * pars pro toto * to attack a woman works as well in german as it does in english . 
  russian troops in kiev , you say ? 
  following the reporting back then . 
  they were n't even able to get all their planes and ships out . 
  in the end , i am no military expert , but their performance in east ukraine do n't inspire any trust in their capabilities . 
   he said `` lady , shut up '' not according to the source . 
  seems he said `` shut up ** as a woman ** . '', 
  oh yeah , she does not seem like a woman to be trifled with . 
  angela merkel was called `` my girly '' by kohl . 
  later she disposed of him ... 
  russia got a lot of aid in the 1990 's . 
  lately , i do n't see any country receiving solidarity that under some flimsy pretext annexed parts of another one . 
  it does n't get much more sexist than telling a woman she ca n't contradict a man because she 's a woman , either in german or english . 
   but many authoritarian regimes receieve complete solidarity from the west that does in no way contradict what i wrote . 
  `` more '' ? 
   `` lady shut up , '' ar\u0131n\u00e7 told hdp 's nursel aydo\u011fan , who responded to the deputy prime minister [ ... ] after aydo\u011fan continued her reaction , ar\u0131n\u00e7 told her to `` shut up as a woman . '' good thing a couple of female mp 's are fuming over this . 
  guess they could use some help from male colleagues though . 
  democracies typically feel entitled to solidarity from other democracies . 
  i will not lie - it 's a good thing . 
  the thorny part is that every solidarity has limits , and at this point differences typically emerge . 
  could be that obamas inaction was a contributing factor , but i 'd also look at georgia couple of years earlier and how they got away with it back then . 
  - china vs ussr : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sino-soviet_border_conflict#border_conflict_of_1969 - china vs india : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-29373304 - pakistan vs india : http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/10/08/india-pakistan-incursion-kashmir-idindee99707m20131008 and of course we do n't know if israel had nukes back at the time of the yom kippur war, 
  do n't forget the soviet anti-ship cruise missiles :  when senior iranian officials unveiled the soumar cruise missile on 8 march , they did not say how far the ` long-range ' weapon could fly . 
   nevertheless , a figure of 2,500 km rapidly emerged as this is the stated range of the soviet kh-55 cruise missile that the soumar appears to be a copied from . 
  this would ostensibly seem to be a fair assertion , given that ukrainian officials revealed in 2005 that 12 kh-55 missiles were illegally sold to iran ( as well as another six to china ) without their nuclear warheads in 2001 . 
  from [ jane 's ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/49998/analysis-iranian-cruise-missile-unveiling-raises-questions-about-range ) . 
  i dont ' know , i think it has more to do with the events in ukraine . 
  when their puppet was removed , they acted , because otherwise ukraine might go western . 
   this gives ukraine the ability to kill the greenmen , as there would be no further escalation on russia 's part only the ukrainian army was in no shape to kill the invasion force . 
  russia had and has a huge conventional superiority . 
  their army is nowhere near western standards , but they started modernizing some time after 2000 . 
  ukraine ... well . 
   with nukes ukraine would quickly swept out `` green men '' and russia would n't dare to use proper invasion out out of nuclear strike retaliation that 's complete bs . 
  the ukrainian army was in no shape to `` sweep out '' the little green men . 
  it was ( is ? ), 
  a demoralized army with bad training and outdated equipment . 
  russia is at least 10 years ahead in modernizing their army . 
  ukraine could not have threatened to use nukes to get russia to withdraw their occupying force , that 's lunacy against a neighbor that holds 5x your nukes . 
  our thoughts are with you , i hope you and your loved ones are all right in this tragic hour !, 
  i will include you in my prayers . 
  ca n't say i 'd blame them considering the west is in bed with the house of saud * and * israel . 
  but it would be the first country to get there while iaea crawling over the place . 
  even best korea with their help from pakistan had to throw the inspectors out . 
  it 's not like the nukes would have deterred russia from taking crimea and even less likely they would have prevented the russian aggression in east ukraine . 
  but yeah , ukraine has been let down royally . 
  sucks to be iran now ... 
  i looked at the publishing time and assumed it to be fresh news . 
  somehow time.com goofed big time , it seems . 
  source ? 
  lol that guy is as dumb as a squid . 
  you would n't think professors of economy were constantly high . 
   does n't have italy have some heavy-duty assimilation training for these refugees ? 
  only very few euro countries have that . 
  it stems from the idea that refugees are here temporarily and do n't need to assimilate . 
  no need to point out that the idea is flawed , i know . 
  i suspect some countries cram refugees in camps and leave them to boredom to get rid of them asap . 
  repost : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f0a3d/how_germany_prevailed_in_the_greek_bailout/, 
  no you ca n't . 
  i concur that peak power output is not that interesting , but in the end it shows what the current installed capacity relative to power consumption is . 
  treason typically has no personal monetary gain as the goal . 
  not that i see his handling of the negotiations as treason , though . 
  that 's why the author points to the baseline 25 % two sentences later . 
   it does seem a little strange that the government hacking itself would be illegal . 
  government is usually bound to laws ( excluding the nsa ) . 
  already here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3evu89/germanys_five_wise_men_say_eurozone_countries/, 
   berlin , paris and rome have -- more or less -- already voiced their support for bofinger 's point of view and further integration . 
  idk ... gathering experience for 20 years on a system where countries can declare bankruptcy would be better than rushing into a fiscal union now - creating a fiscal union will take years . 
  years in which the emu is unprotected . 
  good luck , baden-w\u00fcrttemberg alone has 10.5 m inhabitants , roughly 2m more than the whole of switzerland ... * dann wird in der schweiz nur noch schw\u00e4bisch gesprochen , freunde !, 
   the video makers want to be clear that such violence is n't representative of all ukrainians . 
  speaking in the video , kis concludes that the video shows `` in our society there are very few aggressive homophobic radicals of course not * all * ukrainians . 
  but if you got only 28 % who support equal rights , `` very few '' aggressive homophobes seems a bit far fetched . 
  now with auto-broomsticks and intelligent cotton-balls !, 
  you forget that greek gdp is now 25 % lower and new loans were taken out . 
   is something wrong with piketty ? 
  those loans that were restructured were all related to world wars . 
  now , one can make the point that germany should have been given less leeway , considering those were all war-related , but 1 . 
  germany currently gets a lot of flak for its financial discipline ( reducing debt instead of investing more ) 2 . 
  i 'd say the versailles debt was meant to be punitive and the hitler economy was totally ruinous . 
  after ww ii , the country was in complete ruins and it still paid back a lot . 
  germany paid back reparations till nearly a century after the war , so people do n't exactly see the country as a serial defaulter . 
   and i believe that greek deal fell through no . 
  hard to tell from the pictures , but does n't look very recent to me . 
  keep us posted if something comes up . 
   germany possibly pushing to taking china 's side wat ? 
   i do n't get it , seriously , why is having consensus a bad thing for progress ? 
  i thought consensus was the goal of debates . 
  if no one ever questions the consensus , progress dies . 
  a discussion , even a heated one , over where change is needed it vital . 
  arriving at a new consensus is the goal , but we are lacking the debate part , currently .
