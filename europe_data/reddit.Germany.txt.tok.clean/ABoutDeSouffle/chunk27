   you did n't link surveys but only some newspaper articles mentioning surveys . 
  sad loser   germany already has the lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz , so gays can be treated equally you obviously do n't know this law . 
  but it does n't matter - it 's just a question of time till there will be fully equal marriage rights . 
  just show me one war between eu countries . 
  do n't rush it , i 'll be waiting . 
  2 trillion . 
   there is nothing arbitrary about that . 
  that 's not true . 
  the german economy was reeling from the post-unification effects till the late 2000 's . 
  that 's why we got the suppressed wage growth , even though southerners think it was to conquer the eur-zone . 
  starting those graphs in 1990 of all years is brutal bullshit . 
   real german wages have basically been stagnant for about two decades , which leads to low domestic consumption if it was so easy , the usa would be in a terrible economic situation : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:us_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg, 
  i do n't quite understand the problem with german wages : http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/2014/12/08/datawatch-real-wages-since-the-crisis/ - and of course it does exactly what varoufakis in his robber baron role tried to do , `` recycle '' german trade surplus . 
  and household consumption in germany is not lower than in france for example : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ne.con.petc.zs, 
  i am doing something wrong with the 8h/day i work ... 
  well a lot of brits want out of the obligations but do n't want to relinquish control , so i am not surprised about the downvotes . 
  the money would of course flow back into the countries in the end . 
  it would just be distributed differently - surplus countries would receive less , deficit countries more . 
  but you 'd also receive from that tax ... old man sch\u00e4uble would not propose an additional tax that would be used for transfers only . 
  we 'd need to make sure to scale back the eu to a free trade zone without much political leverage though . 
  obviously , other taxes would have to be lowered . 
   the lgbt crowd does n't support the cdu/csu to begin with that 's not true for all - in fact there are quite some conservative gays . 
  ironically those are most likely to both vote cdu * and * marry given the chance . 
  i think there 's even a gay platform in the cdu . 
   the majority of the population is against gay marriage . 
  got a survey to back that up ? 
  let 's hope for the next election . 
  the majority of the population is in favour of opening marriage . 
   right brain person to left brain person i do n't think that 's a thing anymore in science . 
  nakedcapitalism has been rabidly anti-german for years . 
  yeah , true . 
  the insinuation that we 'd annex poland again was extremely tasteful . 
  ** tl/dr ** : wehrmacht luftwaffe crushing german predominance unconditional capitulation neville chamberlain terrorism isis aggression conducted in the name of germany traditional german anti-democratic authoritarianism, 
   beside the provisions on the priority of international law , an array of other constitutional provisions could be corrected , considering the more than 20-year service of our constitution that sounds extremely scary . 
  it is n't helped by the fact that 20 years is not a long time for a constitution . 
   armed criminal armed burglaries are not a massive problem here . 
  arming the society to deal with a non-relevant problem is just dumb . 
  no , eesti , sorry . 
  ok , i amended my answer . 
  sorry for causing offense . 
  seems you disagreed with me some time before and used downvote to express it , 
  it was legal since 1968 , so the amount of degeneracy it caused seems limited . 
  public moral standards were afaik pretty much against it all the time , but a country should not pass laws on the basis of public morals . 
  honestly i do n't really know . 
  i think you 'd have to go through the whole process of obtaining permanent residency , you could n't just apply for a job and stay here . 
  no , to protect the victims . 
  if only i remembered which subreddit made those collages , though . 
  which is true and which i do support . 
  in the case of gays , there is no one harmed if they live their life like they were born . 
  in the case of pedophiles , it is different . 
  we should not judge people on what they are but what they do . 
  that 's why we have [ prevention project dunkelfeld ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prevention_project_dunkelfeld ) over here . 
  probably does not want a bloody nose because he is a muslim migrant . 
  edit : ok , sorry , i am offending people here . 
  i did not want to give the impression i think you guys in eastern europe are hell-bent on `` removing kebabs '' . 
  it 's just that stereotype would have it your countries are a less welcoming or safe place for muslim immigrants than western europe . 
  it 's good you challenge that . 
  which arguments exactly ? 
  that 's what they said about legalizing homosexuality  - or still say in russia . 
  seriously : that line of argument is completely flawed . 
  the law should protect and enable the individual , not press it into some moralistic duty to society unless absolutely needed . 
  i dunno if it would work , but i 'd apply in every fucking art-school in the netherlands , austria , germany , sweden as a student and try to get my foot in the door . 
  if they accept you , there is a much higher chance you get a visa and you 'll be better off than as a refugee . 
   as long as it 's still illegal to get children due to hereditary diseases . 
  why ? 
  everyone with a hereditary disease can have children here . 
   but anything in which it is n't between two legally equal people ** just seems wrong ** that 's the point i am trying to make . 
  it just seems wrong . 
  but is it ? 
  and why ? 
  if the state has the duty to protect animals from cruelty , it is doing a shitty job over here when it comes to livestock . 
  or research animals . 
  or zoo animals . 
  or pets . 
  the situation of kids or mentally handicapped persons is way better and that 's no coincidence - animals are second-rate beings in our societies . 
   also it 's debatable whatever zoophilia is part of animal cruelty . 
  but the debate never takes place , it is just taken for granted . 
  i am no expert in bestiality , but if it works similar to human sexuality , there 's a lot of handjobs or blowjobs ( ugh ) involved . 
  and dogs seem pretty happy to hump everything that 's humpable . 
  i completely fail to see the cruelty here . 
  well , we did have two school massacres with legal weapons , so something should be done . 
  those numbers are always flawed - the only reliable way to measure would be caverject to get a full erection and then measure it in a lab situation so the method is always the same . 
  i do n't see how that would be possible though , so the numbers are always self-reported or scraped together from obscure sources . 
  need to spend more time in ireland ... 
  there could even be a negative correlation ... 
  it 's in the image ? 
   the german efficiency lives in the south . 
   as far as i know germany allready has relative strict weapon laws , what exactly would you tighten ? 
  i think there are way too many weapons in private hands . 
  all our school massacres have been perpetrated with legal weapons lately . 
  i 'd completely outlaw storing of ammo in households except for those who are allowed to own weapons because they are considered in personal danger . 
  most private weapons are afaik owned by sports hunters and gut nuts , and they should deposit their ammo at the next police station . 
  that sounds like the plot of a massively cheesy porn flick ... 
  cheers , guys !, 
  it 's always a source of pride if a nation gets rid of a dictatorship by an uprising . 
  come on france ... 
  sure , to me those are crimes without a victim . 
  to get it out of the way , i am not talking about fathers raping their daughters , or psychopaths torturing animals for sexual gratification . 
  bans on sexual relations between parents and underage children and animal cruelty should remain or made more clear . 
  also bans against animal brothels would be fine with me .
