  also : poor couple , what a shitty welcome . 
  not surprising , account is 45min old , content is beyond dumb , lines of argument are cookie-cutter ultra-right-wing ... 
   if your facebook friend writes '' i hate white men '' and you click like , then you can be considered for '' complicity in genocide '' . 
  palm , meet face . 
  anything less then genocide would n't do , i suppose ? 
   greece 's agricultural sector has gotten a tax break for years . 
  farmers pay a 13 percent income tax rate , compared with a 25 percent tax other greeks pay . 
  [ ... ]  but the proposed greek reform package does n't include a farm tax hike , and on monday , tsipras said he would need until aug. 5 to rally support to get one approved by parliament . 
  [ ... ]  creditors want a 25 percent tax imposed on all greeks , which would deter scofflaws who try to skate the tax system by declaring themselves farmers . 
  i trust they use the same definition of unemployment as in the eu ? 
  i wish people would use the search function : - 2 days ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ds20y/dominique_strausskahn_to_my_german_friends/ - 3day ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dx8y5/dominique_strausskahn_to_my_german_friends/, 
  it 's completely unclear how a grexit would work , there is no provision for a member state to leave the emu . 
  most likely there will be no grexit till next year and then a solution will be found that keeps greece in the eu . 
  how ? 
  idk , but usually , the eu is good in finding ways if there are wills . 
  they will defend europe to the last european !, 
  uhm , about that missile shield : was n't it to destroy iranian rockets carrying nukes ? 
  there has been a treaty , you know ? 
  i got mad respect for stoltenberg as a human being and a leader as well as for how norway handled this . 
  economically , you can find some of it [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transition_economy ) and of course after accession to the eu , structural funds were available for infrastructure investments . 
  politically , the perspective of joining the eu ensured that the countries established democracies and pursue reforms . 
  there 's nothing arbitrary about locations . 
  i guess chinese companies would be thrilled to build mercedes cars or iphones based on a strict set of guidelines for how to manufacture them - alas the brand name protection grants mercedes and apple monopoly rights . 
  reading faz is fine , just be aware that they have a conservative agenda hiding behind their broadsheet format - like reading s\u00fcddeutsche or taz is fine if you take their orientation into account . 
  the problem is with people - and there are a lot in germany - who take their world view from faz or focus or welt . 
  in germany , organic food has taken off , it is sold even in discount supermarkets like aldi . 
  and do you get turned down by women from the muslim/mediterranean background as well ? 
  there 's also an interesting [ blog post by okcupid ] ( http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/race-attraction-2009-2014/ ) ** men ** - non-black men applied a penalty to black women - while black men showed little racial preference either way ** women ** - all women preferred men of their own race - but they otherwise penalized both asian and black men furthermore , white guys had a distinct advantage over all groups, 
  no , you are not wrong , swiss trains are very good , very silent and clean and in fact much more punctually than ours in germany . 
  switzerland does invest a lot more in their infrastructure than we do . 
  soon ... 
  i get that . 
  considering they are rather strict when it comes to ip and brand names , they should understand the idea , however . 
  german ice 's are running the basel - interlaken connection , 
  they are still running some ec/ic lines , but the next generation ( icx ) will see them replaced with the same trains as the ice . 
  on regional lines , there 's a lot more competition - competitors have taken away regional transport in many german states and have invested , so the situation is good as far as trains are concerned . 
  investment in rail infrastructure is even worse than at the national level though ( more lines , less traffic ... ), 
  yeah , i believe that sucks and i can see this as a real problem . 
  if i were you , i 'd forgo dating platforms , those work bad for a lot of natives as well . 
  you best chance would be to be part of a social circle and get to know people , have friends etc. 
  it would probably be easier to find a partner that already knows you 're not going to have her convert to islam , wear a niqab and all that . 
  edit : also , why not date women from mediterranean/muslim origin ? 
  that 's the sawdust stuff , right ? 
  the eu has been * too * successful in a way . 
  it was formed to ensure peace in europe through trade , to stabilize especially the franco-german relationship . 
  that has worked . 
  stabilizing post-communist and post-dictatorial countries has also worked . 
  lifting living standards in the east more or less also . 
  there 's hardly any mission left that makes a good story people believe in . 
  more immigration ? 
  hardly . 
  more common market ? 
  no one really loves that except for entrepreneurs . 
  and politicians have been abusing the `` eu bureaucrat monster '' for their appeals to the simple-minded nationalists at home when they did not have the guts to be held responsible for their politics . 
  that one now backfires because people believe the eu bureaucrat monster saga . 
  i call bs on that . 
  trucks pay for using the autobahns , ever seen the `` tollcollect '' signs ? 
  it 's our government that seems to think spending money is somehow odious . 
  and of course their voters who pray to st. sch\u00e4uble while reading faz and welt . 
  til , thanks , 
  well , that 's exactly what i intended with that sentence . 
  it was kind of a joke about the convoluted ownership/control structure . 
  just confiscate it and someone starts crying so you have the guy to collect the tax from . 
  if you try an exegesis of what i write based on single words , you 'll get nowhere . 
  i am not a native speaker . 
  also : it was a * german * joke . 
  they mean both , actually . 
  the problem hits our train system as well . 
  look at the [ diagram ] ( http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article143434673/deutschland-laesst-seine-gleise-verrotten.html ) to see how much countries invest in their rail infrastructure . 
  each dot [ here ] ( http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2014-11/deutsche-bahn-fahrplan-karte-langsamfahrstellen ) shows you a spot where the trains have to slow down because a bridge or length of track is unsound for normal operation . 
  there 's hardly any wifi on german trains , the bahn has too few of the flagship ice 's and a lot of those are nearing retirement age . 
  it 's still not bad compared to other countries , but it 's neglect . 
  as a german , i can not approve !, 
  repost : http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/us-to-europe-dont-move-my-cheese-120387.html, 
  also : no for investments in cable-bound internet infrastructure - i do n't need a dsl line for my iphone . 
  and country-wide outlawing of cellphone towers because cancer . 
  the word is still casually used all over the world ( except in germany ) for non-champagne sparkling stuff . 
  ah , ghent is such a beautiful city . 
  what a pity i do n't have to do a business trip there right now . 
  that will work wonders , especially for those women who had already been subjugated to sexual harassment/rape . 
  nothing like reinforcing ptsd to create a bright future for those who are really in need of a shelter . 
  next bright idea ? 
  i am too lazy to research this right now , but i think there 's hardly any large purely german construction companies left , they are mostly french/spanish-owned by now . 
  he is csu . 
  those guys understand nothing about the necessity of a fast internet infrastructure . 
  if they had their say , every internet user in germany would have to have a `` internet driving license '' , would be registered and nicknames would be forbidden . 
  i knew it . 
  so , after being responsible for `` zionist apartheid '' ( that term from the article alone should net you a ban here ) , we are now also responsible for some islamist lunatics . 
  let 's see what 's next . 
  i guess , some moron will find a way germany is responsible for the rise of da'esh and putin too . 
  that 's why i wrote free capitalism , not free trade , right ? 
  if someone cares for the background of this decision , it is less about greece or the eurozone or the european union , but more about germany . 
  we have this dirty little secret : since  12 years ( 10 years of this under the center/conservative cdu/csu ) , [ our public net investments have been negative ] ( http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/more-investment-germany%e2%80%99s-sake ) , ie . 
  our infrastructure is rotting for lack of upkeep . 
  this [ is considered a direct threat ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/diw-weak-infrastructure-investment-threatens-german-future-a-907885.html ) to our future - ironically our vast trade surpluses get invested in housing bubbles abroad while roads and [ waterways ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/11150306/german-model-is-ruinous-for-germany-and-deadly-for-europe.html ) are crumbling ( thanks ambrose `` bash the krauts '' evans-pritchard ) . 
  gross fixed capital formation as a % of gdp has been in decline since 40 years ( [ fun image ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-gross-fixed-capital-formation-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.png?s=%2fgermany%2fgross-fixed-capital-formation-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html&amp;lbl=0&amp;v=201507310000&amp;z=1 ) ) . 
  so , dear european neighbors , prepare for some expensive infrastructure programs you 'll have to finance once germany 's population ages more and the infrastructure crisis hits . 
  thanks in advance edit : of course , 2.7 bn is nothing compared to what would be needed , at least they do something to slow the decay now . 
  it 's a simple collision of interests . 
  the usa does not have strong gi , but very strong brand names - those are holy for some reason .
