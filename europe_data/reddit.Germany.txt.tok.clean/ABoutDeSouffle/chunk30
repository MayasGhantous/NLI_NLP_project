  undermining gi while keeping brand names =  100 % win for the the usa . 
  everything else is just sugar-coating the issue . 
  of course it would , because the most efficient producer would dominate the market and buyers would have price advantages . 
  look burgers , just call them `` wisconsin cheese '' , problem solved . 
  european companies can not produce and sell iphones , why should trade names be protected and geographic indications not ? 
  if you want really free capitalism , knock down trade name protection . 
  at least for syrian and eritrean refugees that 's completely moronic . 
  you can not legally send them back into a war zone/oppressive regime . 
  i think the scots are more social democrat leaning . 
  texas is probably more similar . 
  how the bavarians cut out special deals for them is similar to scotland , though . 
  no hitler , no nietzsche , no hyperinflation , no swabian housewife , no `` debt means guilt in german '' . 
  what a nice surprise !, 
  crap , it 's not available in germany . 
  i know imageboards and i know how to troll/fuck up a different forum . 
  that 's why i am reasonably sure it is not happening here currently . 
  what * is * happening imo is that the sub gets more exposure and attracts a more representative selection of the european population . 
  most european countries have a strong extreme right party , typically 5-10 % of the population vote for them . 
  a number finding their way here is to be expected . 
  furthermore i should think that really huge parts of the population are extremely uneasy when it comes to mass immigration , esp . 
  from muslim countries . 
  they might not say that in a circle of friends , but on a semi-anonymous internet forum you can see them talking about it . 
  afaik that was years ago and this link gets posted again and again . 
  i doubt the nazi-forum is actually brigading here in numbers . 
  doubtful  , and sometimes , ignorance is bliss, 
  i even prefixed it with `` it does n't make sense to blame one country '' ... 
  yeah , years ago , in * france profonde * , some old lady shouted boche after us . 
  but that 's really rare . 
  that 's just paraphrasing what i wrote , even the link is one i had . 
  what gives ? 
  because that worked so great the first time ? 
  it does not make sense to pin it one country - the company allegedly dodging taxes [ is athens international airport aia ] ( http://www.thepressproject.gr/details_en.php?aid=67522 ) , not hochtief directly . 
  aia is a greek company that was managed till 2013 by [ hochtief concessions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hochtief_concessions ) , a german company and 100 % subsidiary of hochtief , or maybe [ hochtief airport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hochtief_airport ) , which is now [ avialliance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avialliance ) , owned by a canadian public pension fund , [ psp investments ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_sector_pension_investment_board ) . 
  seems the greek state is the majority owner of aia . 
  hochtief is a [ german company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hochtief ) where a spanish group , [ acs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grupo_acs ) has a commanding majority . 
  say hello to modern international capitalism . 
  btw : aia [ denies charges ] ( https://www.aia.gr/company-and-business/press-and-media/press-office/press-releases/daa-or8h-enhmerwsh-se-synexeia-dhmosieymatwn-gia-fpa ) . 
  just repo the fucking airport and look who starts crying . 
  huge superiority complex , redneck attitudes , constantly cutting themselves sweetheart deals because they have their own local party . 
  that 's our secret sauce : most everyone else has forgiven us because we have n't . 
  i had no idea people in the uk/usa are actually toying with such ideas . 
  good thing we put some distance between us and them in the bush era . 
  that 's reddit ... 
  that 's not really surprising , i 'd say . 
  each and every head of state and chancellor/prime minister has worked towards that . 
  i am not sure the political elites of any other pair of countries have been that earnest and hard-working about reconciliation . 
  it 's a pity the current crop of center/right politicians seem to care less than the generation ago . 
  we have the [ weizs\u00e4ckers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weizs%c3%a4cker_family ) , but none of their offspring currently is in politics afaik . 
  the [ lambsdorffs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_graf_lambsdorff ) are a small-scale dynasty , i 'd say . 
  you want germany to veto ( or rather keep out of ) military action ? 
  overstepping the nato mandate is exactly the way to do it . 
  the bullshitting about iraqi wmd 's is not forgotten over here , so preparing occupation of russia under phony pretexts is in fact undermining nato . 
  already paid for them , amirite ? 
  still , the idea that a conventional war russia/nato leads to nato invariably invading russia is rather far-fetched . 
  the idea that nato would occupy moscow is demented . 
  and i do agree with / u/wadcann - there are a lot of steps lacking where de-escalation could happen . 
  the whole point of krugman is that he is fighting a domestic battle against the us 's libertarians/tea party/republicans who want to trim down the state even more . 
  he merely uses europe as a canvas to project on , that 's why he uses denmark freely in both articles , that 's why he is constantly trash-talking the baltics . 
   how can you even compare the two ? 
  they are both deceptively simple ( to put it politely ) ? 
   the soft drink is simply a way to illustrate that abandoning a wrong idea is a good thing . 
  that 's like politicians here in germany constantly evoke the need to balance you personal budget and if you got into debt , cut expenses to get out of it - when talking about national budgets . 
  both are massively misleading and moronic parallels that lead both the author and the reader astray . 
  dumbing down the debate does not really help . 
  so a multi-country monetary union is just another soft-drink brand . 
  i cringe at the intellectual level of debate ( or lack of it ) right now . 
  so the clue train is arriving at last , paul ? 
  good to hear . 
  funny how the brits never got over their expulsion from the exchange rate system . 
  that shock still seems to linger in their collective psyche and requires them to see the eur as necessarily breaking apart . 
  doubtful , we do n't consider the usa , canada or india european even though they have been under european rule or very close to our culture . 
  i guess we 'd call them `` western '', 
  someone tell google , they could enhance their siri-clone to do live translations . 
  it more or less is not , in poland . 
  the flag of the union is also the union flag , stop arguing !, 
  so you ca n't be bothered to either abstain from fucking or use a condom or have a vasectomy , but on the other hand everyone else but you should pay ? 
  yeah , that sounds fair . 
   if we wanted to follow biology closely gay people shouldnt be able to have children wat ? 
  obviously they have all it takes to have kids . 
   i mean what if man wants to keep a baby but woman aborts it , do i understand correctly that he ca n't do anything right now to have this baby ? 
  in a 12-weeks ( in germany ) window of time that 's true . 
  after that , she can not decide to abort it . 
  in that 12 weeks - oh fuck it , i wo n't go into that whole tedious argument again . 
   i hate that my government is siding against germany on the issue naaa , it 's ok , our gov ' t needs some resistance so they do n't get it in their heads they are right on all counts  then we march into paris and burn it to the ground as they create the fourth reich and we form the amero union you are a real bro , 
  that german self-pity ... 
  we could even make that a reverse join because we are many more , 
  in germany the biological father has to pay alimony except in a few corner cases . 
  i 'd say law follows biology rather closely . 
  seriously : if you do n't want to pay , use a fucking condom or get a vasectomy . 
  do n't expect society to pick up the tab because you could n't be bothered to care about contraceptives . 
  i am all for male rights , but that specific debate is usually just another way of saying `` i do n't want to use condoms , but i do n't want to be bothered with the consequences '' . 
  if you really do n't want kids , have a vasectomy . 
  if you have frequently sex with different partners , still use a condom . 
  then start having babies yourself ? 
  women also have the fun of having their body radically altered by child birth , a certain risk of death ( low in our countries , but extremely high in other regions or times ) and if the relationship breaks are usually the ones saddle with the kids . 
  biology is asymmetrical ( guys just wo n't get pregnant ) , so i fail to see why the law must be totally symmetrical here . 
  up to a certain point , the fetus can not survive without the maternal body , so one could argue it is more a part of the mother than an independent being . 
  having fun with the absurd would be my guess . 
   so is it possible for men to waive a right to this child ( along with obligation to pay alimonies for this child ) before it is born ? 
  not in germany , i honestly do n't see how this would mirror rights here .
