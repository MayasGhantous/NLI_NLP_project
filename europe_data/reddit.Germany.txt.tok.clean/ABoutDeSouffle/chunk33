  i am not even sure if this does not violate basic human rights . 
  the idea is a non-starter on that alone . 
  further , there is a [ correlation between long-term unemployment and depression ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/06/17/studies-show-link-between-long-term-joblessness-and-depression/ ) . 
  depression critically undermines a person 's capability to `` man up , suck it up and get off his ass '' . 
  therefore , this idea would effect nothing , you do n't get depressed people to move by marginalizing and penalizing them . 
   that the economy would be in a better state with more loans and changing nothing at the time being . 
  well , that 's how it was till 2007 when everything came tumbling down . 
  creditors want to be repaid , they do n't want to give you money because you need it . 
  the ideal outcome would have been : greece drafts and implements some brutal reforms ( akin to those in the post-socialist countries in the 90 's ) and the rest of europe donates enough money so that greece can survive the next couple of years . 
  both sides did not do that . 
   why should i have to leave my country just to hope for a better future ? 
  how would you feel if that was the case for you ? 
  do you think that is normal considering i m a `` european '' everyone would feel shitty , i can sympathize . 
  however , that 's the reality today . 
  ireland lost a huge load of people , berlin is full of spaniards who came over . 
  even in the us there are constant migrations between poor and thriving parts . 
  as you are young , see the opportunities in working in another eu country . 
  you can still come back in 10 years speaking another language and with your international background . 
  great idea !, 
  voting rights for the unemployed are a * constant * and * sizable * drag on budgets , so that would fix that . 
  unemployed also tend to vote for * their * interests , so the change would nip that in the bud . 
  stretching it a bit , one could rightfully say that long-term unemployed spend their time voting instead of looking for work , so taking away their procrastination outlet would make them looking harder for a job . 
  what for ? 
  / u/cueball25 has a point , the result of such a referendum is very predictable . 
  give us back our sausages , you thieves !, 
  heh , good luck with that ... 
  btw , how 's the czech social security and medical insurance system ? 
  what do you get if you are fired and for how long ? 
  if you are long-term jobless , who covers medical insurance ? 
  how 's the pension system ? 
  sure , but currently the only legal referenda could be held on territorial changes . 
  i doubt anyone would amend the constitution for the greek bailout . 
   if there was no austerity and no program i think the situation would have been much better , what do you think ? 
  austerity is not a political program , it 's the result of cuts and downsizing . 
  i do n't think the situation was adequately handled , but i am also unsure what the better alternative would have been . 
   all i can think about at the moment is studying abroad so that i can have a decent living . 
  that 's the only sensible thing to do if you do n't get extremely lucky . 
  oh my fucking god , i just watched the video . 
  awkward does n't even begin to describe it . 
  y' all are not lazy enough to be successful !, 
  like [ that ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/jul/16/austerity-protests-athens-berlin-in-pictures ) ? 
  thanks very much , 
   and they are not allowed to give debt haircuts . 
  that is why the former was all forced on private lenders . 
  well , this is exactly what he is saying , right ? 
  that 's why he wants greece out of the ez , so a debt cut would be allowed . 
  well , germany is out , it would n't be legal over here . 
  and ? 
  what does it say about how a bailout or a debt cut violates the treaties . 
  i mean , stop playing games with me . 
  i wrote ** by heart ** for a reason . 
  everyone can google shit , does n't mean you know what you are talking about . 
  and we all have seen the mood it has caused , 
  with all due respect , i do n't think you and i know the treaties by heart . 
  that 's hardly news , he has always been very critical of those `` bailouts '', 
  as i understand yes . 
  but i guess sch\u00e4uble would rather greek leaves and gets a debt cut than a third bailout . 
  there be lions though . 
  unless greece receives a very sizable parting gift to nationalize the banking system and keep it kicking until things smooth out ** and ** it gets something like a 75 % debt writedown , it will just lead to exploding debt/gdp figures and a wave of private defaults ( what happens to loans taken out in eur ? ), 
  and either a sovereign default or hyperinflation . 
  interest rates are , but greece has repayments on the principle upcoming . 
  ok , so the cards are on the table now ( no surprises though ) :  nobody knows at the moment how this is supposed to work without a haircut and everybody knows that a haircut is incompatible with euro membership i guess that also implies he 's open to a debt cut . 
   greece is one of the few european countries that sets prices for over-the-counter drugs , which can be sold only in licensed pharmacies , the organization for economic cooperation and development reported . 
  pharmacies must be owned by licensed pharmacists and they can each own only one . 
  other rules dictate where new pharmacies may open , as well as their operating hours . 
   it 's almost the same in germany . 
  well , no . 
  the prices for otc medications are no longer fixed ( not even for non-otc drugs ) . 
  and one owner can own up to four pharmacies . 
  mail-order pharmacies are allowed . 
  [ german wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/apotheke ), 
  our ham-handed approach has been creating some additional problems which could have been avoided ( syriza being one of them ) . 
  i am also not too keen on poisonous pedagogy which has some obvious drawbacks besides being un-respectful . 
  there should have been a middle-ground : do n't let greece get away with delaying reforms and taking everyone for a ride , but stop short of teaching them lessons . 
  thanks , corrected . 
  that photo makes him look like a complete idiot  not that berlusconi was any better though . . 
  no , then the eur will be dead . 
  i am no economic 's expert , but i ca n't see how a weak eur would damage greek medical imports as long as they are in the eur . 
  their most imports come from the eur zone . 
  greece is also an exporter of medicine ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_greece#/media/file:greece_export_treemap.jpg ) , so i guess ramping up domestic production would help . 
  debt cut is not a reward for good governance but a last-straw measure to avoid a default , grexit and loss of all loans . 
  why would not other debtor countries get a haircut ? 
  because in that case , voters in the creditor countries would be up in arms . 
  why is it ok to post shitty analogies yet at the same time do nothing to explain them ? 
  he 's the guy that gets slapped around by juncker , 
  at that level , everything is also pr , but i believe she 's a down-to-earth person in her heart . 
  years ago , everyone was so relieved when she finally consulted with a stylist because her dresses and hairstyle were awful . 
  they still are , but no longer an national embarrassment . 
  who will most likely replace him and what does that mean for the canadian politics ? 
  canada has a very solid image over here - well run , sound politics , and of course friendly inhabitants , 
  ** angela merkel ** you all know her , right ? 
  she 's the daughter of a protestant priest and has a phd in ~ ~ physics ~ ~ physical chemistry . 
  she 's famous for the [ pussy-sign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merkel-raute ) she does with her hands . 
  there 's one [ moving photo ] ( http://img.welt.de/img/deutschland/crop130239415/036693526-ci3x2l-w900/angela-merkel-auf-ruegen-1990-2-.jpg ) when she visited fishermen in r\u00fcgen , directly after unification . 
  they were going to be laid off and they knew it . 
  after reunification , she quickly became minister in a kohl cabinet and over long spans of her career was the most underestimated person in national politics . 
  kohl called her simply `` the girl '' and she was handed the job as environmental minister . 
  she is rather shy and likely an introvert . 
  some years later on , she managed to outmaneuver a lot of her better known colleagues and when the current finmin sch\u00e4uble got entangled in [ a shady donations affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal' ) that reeks of corruption in the highest levels of government , she both backstabbed kohl and sidetracked sch\u00e4uble to run for chancellor . 
  which she finally is .
