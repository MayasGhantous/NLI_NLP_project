  things i do n't like ? 
  you disagree with me wayyy to much . 
  lol thanks . 
   but that 's just the thing , we are n't i know the population is not concerning equal marriage . 
  but were were not exactly early in de-criminalizing homosexuality , introducing civil unions and are positively late in equal marriage laws . 
  in the end , that 's what counts . 
  and our attitude towards other family issues like mothers working is very conservative . 
  thanks for putting me right !, 
  he even sprinkled in some `` orwellian '' ... 
  it 's not like i am unsympathetic to this opinion . 
  i just think that no one profits if the new reform package ( or versailles , however you want to call it ) is again only partly implemented , or late , or not really . 
  this will just add fuel to the conservative fire on the german side and greeks still feel they are under a foreign occupation forcing failed measures on them . 
  i seriously have no idea how to resolve this , but the way it is going currently , it will be anther train wreck . 
  as long as she does not turn into sarah palin ... 
  ~ ~ adoption is frequently separate from equal marriage laws . 
  i think neither in ireland nor in the us gay couples can adopt . 
  you are still right , of course , just saying . ~ ~ edit : fuck that , seems i was completely off . 
  i hope so . 
  unfortunately i do n't believe our current government will come around . 
  sch\u00e4uble - who used to be very pro-europe - only has one aim : making every ez country work like germany . 
  and merkel is east-german . 
  she has no emotional attachment to the eu like earlier chancellors like kohl had . 
  our next federal election is in 2017 . 
  the unsustainability of this deal will become apparent in this year at the latest and will lead to even more moronic decisions . 
  no one actually believes in this deal :  tsoukalas , an honorary state mp with syriza , added :  `` the agreement is a provisional set-back that at some point will be re-negotiated , it is a bid for time . '' this is just the next disaster waiting to happen . 
  syriza will drag their feet , germany will resist any debt cuts or transfer payments , the economy will collapse this year to united moronity so the targets for primary surplus will be missed this year and next . 
  this leads to missed payment targets and in 1.5 - 2 years we are back where we were in february . 
  probably greece would be better off with a debt cut now , guaranteed transfer payments for the next 10 years and no further access to `` bailout '' funds , come hell or high water . 
  i am happy he was tried so survivors had a chance to be heard and the whole inhuman brutality was described . 
  i just think the court could and should have issued no sentence because he 's clearly unfit to go to prison . 
  and if i may say so , the danger of relapse into murderous habits is rather low at his age ... 
  wow , as much as my country tried to cover shit up in the first 20 years after the war , things have changed . 
  putting a 94-yo behind bars seems a bit harsh though . 
  while i agree with you in principle and do n't see compelling reasons to believe russia would try to invade the baltics , there is one more unpleasant option : - create unrest and border conflicts . 
  infiltrate agents to sabotage infrastructure . 
  assassinate journos . 
  leak compromising phone calls , sex videos . 
  cyber-attack companies and gov ' t infrastructure to create damage . 
  in short : create a not-so low-level conflict where it 's very hard to pin the source on russia . 
  that would not be a strategy aimed at winning , but with the aim that the other side loses . 
  also : finland , seriously ? 
  i just hope she does not end up with a bullet in the head one day ... 
  they could carpet-bomb our cities with greenbacks this time ... 
  ** puerto rico closes dozens of schools as economic woes deepen **  located in a city just outside san juan , the school is among more than 150 shuttered in the last five years as a worsening economic crisis has prompted hundreds of thousands of people to move to the u.s. mainland over the past decade . 
   driven by a combination of budget cuts and declining enrollment , the loss of so many schools is having a profound impact on communities in the u.s. island territory let 's just say : if germany forced the closure of schools in greece , everyone would be in arms i may add that greece receives upwards of 6bn per year from the eu . 
  i think the last time i heard something like that it was in iraq ( or afghanistan ? ) . 
  the popcorn will be epic !, 
  this time , all you need is money , leave the tanks at home . 
  no , unfortunately , we are very conservative when it comes to family issues . 
  we have civil unions that are very close to marriage in legal terms , though . 
  we have civil unions that are very close to marriage in legal terms . 
  it 's about the name ( mostly ) . 
  ok , then maybe the other ez members should cancel the deal . 
  if no one in greece takes ownership , it 's pretty clear how things go . 
  look mate , why do n't you simply expand the graph to start from 1995 ? 
  find me ** one fucking year ** before the crisis where the unemployment rate in the ez has been lower than in the usa . 
  just to clue you in , the eur started in full glory in 1999 . 
  you know why this is ? 
  because the ez is kept back by bleeding hearts who treasure their soft-socialism . 
  it 's easy to whip up a graph starting at a convenient point ( krugman-style ) . 
  it 's a bit harder to actually think things through . 
  no , but i want to see one of them in this huge technology museum in germany . 
  if they buy more of them now , maybe 20 years down the road they will sell one of them . 
  no , you can keep quite a lot of stuff , even money . 
  then you should quit the imf , not the eu , that 's what i was talking about . 
  somebody tell the americans there 's oil down there ... problem solved . 
   would a grexit have been easier for the greek economy to bear in 2012 than it would today ? 
  most likely not very much . 
  dropping out of the emu at a time where the eu was preoccupied with salvaging their banking system , bailing out other countries and generally stomping wildfires would have caused as spiteful reactions of the creditors today . 
  it would have been a full-blown default , together with capital controls and no backup from the ecb . 
  greece was overleveraged even back then . 
  personally , i believe the latest they could have thrown the towel was 2008 . 
  back then , it would have really lit up the world financial system as well , so it would n't have been pretty . 
   will a grexit in 2017 be more damaging if the economy had contracted by an additional 20 % in the meantime than if the grexit happened today ? 
  if the economy has contracted another 20 % and greece exits the emu , i would not be surprised by large-scale riots and a civil war . 
  no , this is much tougher, 
   and it would be good deal for him to get sanctions lifted . 
  merkel 's carefully constructed anti-putin diplomacy ( that i quite admire her for ) is in tatters . 
  sure , but is it worth it to spend many bn of eur just to keep the pressure on putin ? 
  i think i know your answer , but some might disagree . 
  at the worst , merkel loses some face and tells everyone `` i tried , but i am not almighty ''  you 've got to be honest and say that having a massive surplus in a currency union is a one-sided deal . 
  no need to tell me , the quoted opinion is not mine . 
  conservatives will tell you `` we made it , so why ca n't they '' . 
  they only see that germany pays handsomely into the eu 's coffers and do not recognize that streamlined regulation , the lack of floating exchange rates , lack of taxes and aligned laws made that success possible . 
   we 're past the point of punishment and into vindictivness - the comparisons to versailles are not unwarrented . 
  again , i wo n't argue that , see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d3xns/eursummit_statement_on_greece_20150712/ct1juca ) . 
  i mean , technically the versailles-comparison is bullshit , because that treaty also prevented germany from having an army , but as an approximation it is valid . 
  unfortunately a lot of conservatives are just happy greeks now have their comeuppance . 
  like it 's some soccer match where you can cheer if your team routs the others . 
   i think that syriza could have been ( maybe still can ) be the best chance of a reforming government simply because they are not part of the old network of corruption . 
  i doubt that . 
  they have no consistent program for modernizing greece ( no matter how your ideological point of view , greece needs a lot of business-friendly changes if you want it to thrive ) , they have started with their own form of nepotism ( giorgos tsipras ) and have not gone after the guys on the lagarde list . 
  maybe to potami would be better , i have no idea . 
   if people finally start acknowledging that germany and their economic institutions are the cause of this mess \\  _ < the dumb , it hurts . 
  does n't scale linearly , 
  just google a bit about monetary unions , transfers and oca . 
  there 's lots and lots of academic research on the topic . 
   even if that someone else turns out to be russia ? 
  germany is not as russophobe as eg . 
  the usa .
