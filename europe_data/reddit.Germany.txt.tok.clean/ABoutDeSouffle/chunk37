   have you noticed that they still do n't know how to finance the bridging agreement ? 
  yup , seems they missed that they could not just plunder the funds they looked at . 
  if i am not mistaken , tsipras will face a mutiny in his country , the funds for a bridge loan are not there and the imf is just right now throwing a huge monkey wrench in the gears . 
  if the imf does no longer belief the greek debt situation is unsustainable , it can not give any more loans . 
  merkel is on record saying the imf needs to be a party to the `` bailout '' . 
  the imf would require a debt cut for this . 
  and sch\u00e4uble says a debt cut is illegal . 
  that 's quite a pickle . 
  i am not sure how they 'll find out of the hole in a few days time . 
  with the political climate in the northern eur countries , i would n't bank on it . 
  i shudder at what i believe will develop in the next days . 
  ** imf : greece needs much deeper debt relief ** breaking away from brussels ... a leaked international monetary fund report has shown that greece needs massively more debt relief than the eurozone has admitted . 
  the imf has updated its debt sustainability analysis to reflect the damage wrecked on the greek economy since capital controls were imposed more than two weeks ago . 
  and it shows that even more greek debt needs to be wiped away that europe faced up to . 
  the imf says :  `` the dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date - and what has been proposed by the esm . '' currently , eurozone countries have been talking about ` reprofiling ' greek debt , to push back repayment dates or cut the interest rate on loans . 
  but this imf report states that greece would need a 30-year grace period . 
  alternatively , the eurozone could make explicit annual transfers of cash to greece , or it could bite the bullet and take `` deep upfront haircuts '' .

  so unless europe swallows the reality that greece needs major debt relief , the imf wo n't provide any more bailout funds . 
  officially , the imf line that it `` stands ready to work with the greek authorities , '' but we can now see that it is actually saying that another `` extend and pretend '' bailout deal is fundamentally flawed [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/14/greek-crisis-tsipras-political-backlash-bailout-osborne-uk-live#block-55a4fd1ce4b0710add77529f ), 
  i think piraeus never had a railway link linking it up to europe 's transcontinental railway network ( or that link was inadequate for expanding business ) :  the agreement coincides with the completion of a rail line linking the port of piraeus with the country 's inter-european railway networks . 
  that 's something no private company would tolerate for long . 
  also , since cosco bought 50 % of the harbor , business seems to flourish : - http://www.investingreece.gov.gr/default.asp?pid=127&amp;nwslid=25&amp;la=1&amp;sec=6 - http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/19/china-piraeus-greece-cosco-thessaloniki-railways - http://www.thepressproject.net/article/70654/china-plans-to-render-piraeus-port-into-the-new-european-gate-for-asian-imports, 
  cosco bought half of piraeus and would like to buy the rest , i think . 
  oh yes , when he trashed his speaker in public he wore a sarcastic smile . 
  well no , it was a grin . 
  no , not even a grin , a contorted mask . 
  so , no . 
   i mean sure , i expected the german public to be supportive of very harsh measures , but this ? 
  truth be told , we do n't know . 
  if we had a referendum ( which is not possible here ) , everything would depend on the phrasing - are you in favor of expropriating the greek state of the most valuable assets or - are you in favor of greek having to offer collateral for further bailout measures you 'd get different answers , most likely . 
  so when someone threatens your world-view with facts , you withdraw to the safe point of paranoia ? 
  hm , i ca n't see him campaigning again . 
  i doubt he wants to become a politician, 
  then the eu is done for . 
  no that just tells you that brits do n't like learning other languages . 
  greece was slowly running out of money and the upcoming debt payments this year would have still been a problem . 
  samaras in august went to berlin , hat in hand , to ask for the easing of program terms and got turned down , which over some month brought syriza to power . 
  i believe the spotty recovery would have picked up steam in 2015 , but that 's to everyone 's guess . 
  what syriza did was destroying any appetite for negotiations , creating a [ brutal capital flight ] ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-06-29/the-greek-damage-in-one-chart ) and by delaying the referendum until after the deadline completely crashing the greek banking system . 
  the resulting capital controls will badly damage what is left of the industry . 
  i believe this will lead to the gdp cratering again this year to the tune of 4-5 % . 
  i still think it does not make that much sense at this point to find fault - the damage is done . 
   gdp was nominally growing largely because prices were falling faster than the economy was shrinking . 
  that makes the gdp fall , not expand . 
  with our tactical broomsticks ? 
  i do n't know what that would help . 
  seriously : the question is moot , russia wo n't . 
  that 's small-town thinking . 
  as the finmin of the largest eu economy , he has also a responsibility towards the other ez countries . 
  with great power and so on . 
  not very much . 
  still merkel/sch \u00e4uble have enough standing to push it through in germany for one time . 
  omg , this is not a news source , this is a right-wing conspiracy website . 
  there 's some legitimate concerns in what you say . 
  i just do n't think germany is usurping power , it has more to do with the uk withdrawing and france being caught in soul-searching . 
  merkel is mostly in it for her party , which is not so great . 
  she might think her course is a necessity for building a solid foundation for the eur ( as sch\u00e4uble does ) , but we do n't know this . 
  sure , i mentioned it because i think it casts a light on his creative handling of the truth . 
  most people here think she handled the last days well . 
  hardly anyone would agree her reputation has been damaged ( personally i see absolutely no reason why it would be damaged ) . 
  people do n't like to read about strained relations to france and are not keen on damaging greece so it has to drop out of the eur . 
  i believe 1000 is just representative for germany . 
  i like him too . 
  he seems like a guy giving no fucks about going into a meeting with the rest of the ez finance ministers and getting ripped there . 
  and in regards to reasons for the crisis , he 's spot on . 
  i just think he has done untold damage to greece by not understanding the difference between academia and politics . 
  interestingly , this casts a doubt on his assertions he had to step down due to pressure from the eurozone members . 
  now he claims he stepped down because he could n't reach an agreement with tsipras . 
  i was probably a bit terse ... what i mean is , if they default on the debt ( denominated in eur and under british law ) and switch to drachma , then their debt burden goes up as drachma devaluates . 
  if they want to pay interest again or pay off principal , they will have to either be extremely austere to arrive at a high primary budgetary surplus or they have to print money like crazy . 
  since austerity is not in high demand , i can see no other way if they want to get back to the financial market . 
  on the contrary , if the new coin devaluates , the debt burden goes up . 
  this way to hyperinflation , germany 1920 's style . 
   at least in the grexit , the new generations in greece can have a future that is not debt . 
  the debt would not magically go away , it would still be there . 
  i do n't see the point of new loans , though . 
  ratcheting up the debt/gdp ration makes the problem only worse . 
  no , it was you who was demanding the eu be torn down and rebuilt . 
  i was just pointing out that 's an illusion imo . 
  if the current eu fails , the appetite for starting again will be below zero . 
  it has a lot of warts , but it still works . 
  no one has an idea how to build a version 2 that would not run into the same problems . 
  you could call cameron and demand treaty-changes so britain get 's an opt-out of the metric system and can go back to imperial units , 
  why not ? 
  it sure as hell will not stabilize outside the eu , so it might be worth a try . 
  what 's more , some of the post-socialist countries were bordering on `` failed state '' after the breakdown of socialism - i 'll just pick romania as one example . 
  the secession of the baltics was even a bloody one and they retain a high percentage of russians . 
  i would n't say the eu is the only factor on why those countries turned out better than expected at the time , but it 's not a stretch to claim it is a contributing factor . 
  eu membership has a lot of benefits and it demands a set of reforms that strengthen the civil society , fair play and lawfulness . 
  do n't fool yourself , there is no second chance . 
  not that this must concern anyone in britain ( the country is solid enough ) , but exiting and waiting on the sidelines for something better coming up wo n't work . 
   and people are desperate to include ukraine in the eu , it 's just baffling say what you want , but the eu has been extremely successful in stabilizing countries ( if we just not let the current greek disaster cloud our view ) . 
  this has been true for spain , portugal and the whole of eastern europe . 
  and of course greece post-dictatorship . 
  splendid idea !, 
  all bantering aside , i would be so happy if the uk did not just withdraw and become self-sufficient but had stepped up their game since 2007 . 
  the uk is closer to us in economic thinking ( ie . 
  less statist and more capitalist than france ) and closer to france militarily, 
  you should update your data .
