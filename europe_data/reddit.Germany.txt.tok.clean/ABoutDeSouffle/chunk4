  uhm no . 
  balkan war refugees went to italy , switzerland and germany for the most part . 
   also , we were culturally and geographically much closer with western europe than these migrants are to us . 
  western europe of the time would like to have a word with you about that . 
  you are fooling yourself , people were * not * delighted to have those strangers over here all of a sudden . 
  awwww < 3, 
   the moment eu agricultural subsidies end , it 's probably the german agriculture which is going to take a beating . 
  yeah right , because our agri sector is so big . 
  read up on the numbers . 
  just call uncle putin . 
  he 'll take you back into his glorious economic union . 
  something , something , hitler , nazi-card , guilt-trip and we are not allowed to voice your opinion . 
  you are completely demented . 
  you do n't seem to need the money if you ca n't absorb it . 
  and if you want to go back to socialism and a protected market , just do it . 
  the entitlement of eastern europeans is really spectacular . 
  unfortunately , i am not sure . 
  the eu is in a really deep crisis now and i fear with the growing nationalism in the uk and eastern europe , it is tearing itself apart . 
  i would n't be surprised to see the uk go . 
  certainly that would be neither the end of the uk nor the eu , but it could trigger the secession of some other countries , eg . 
  maybe it would be for the best if the countries break away that constantly use the eu as a scapegoat , then the rest could move forward . 
  but maybe it would lead to a death by a hundred cuts . 
  you are a net receiver and received 6.6 bn over the period , that 's about 17 % of gdp according to the source . 
  if you are not able to actually call the money , that 's not the eu 's problem , other ee states were capable of using the promised money . 
  as you currently receive 2bn eur/year and have to pay 480 , you are still 1.5 bn ahead . 
  that 's 200eur per capita ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/11221427/eu-budget-what-you-need-to-know.html ), 
  until a couple of months ago i thought the uk was indispensable in the eu , but seeing that they ca n't make up their minds , i have stopped caring . 
  getting rid of them and a couple of the eastern european states would allow for a lot more focus . 
  they are your natural allies . 
  you sound like them . 
  every other post from you here is `` gibe more monies , plox '' . 
  it 's not hard to see what your understanding of fairness is . 
  also : you do n't seem to understand that all the ee countries are ~ 110m people . 
  france and germany are 150m . 
  guess what that means for a eu government . 
  it 's nearly 17 % of your gdp , how is that a low number ? 
  you ca n't compare nominal values because a eur in bulgaria buys much more than in czech republic . 
  just say it , you do n't care shit for federalization , you want the money . 
   and we like our drug dealers anyway . 
  i doubt i read this sentence before anywhere  you are bordering the more conservative states of germany , so there is a bad mood about drug imports from czechia . 
  in the liberal states , the situation is like in your country , but i believe we have less designer drug labs . 
  one can hope that the guy follows through with his 200m , that would probably cover food , housing , clothing for a long time . 
  i also hope he has set aside enough money to build and staff schools , or we are looking at a unruly gang of illiterate youth a couple of years down the road . 
  people will nag about everything . 
  that photo is missing a handful of messerschmitts :p, 
   after world war ii , europeans grew accustomed to the united states ' taking the lead in addressing security threats in and around europe . 
  that has nurtured a complacency in europe 's foreign and security posture , the dangers of which have now been fully exposed . 
  dear americans , if you had stopped addressing security threats around europe we 'd not be in this mess right now . 
  isis is the result of your strategic master plan for the middle east . 
  the article lumps together all countries in europe , where it is probably talking about countries like the uk , the netherlands or germany with a very low unemployment rate . 
  i am a bit wary of rose-coloring everything - it 's totally not a given that increased immigration will be good for economic growth , the article mentions it too . 
  it needs repeating though , that taking in refugees is not about economical benefits for the sheltering countries . 
  its about humanitarian obligations first and defusing the bomb of a generation without hope sitting in the deserts of jordan second . 
  dark , 
  and the whole station traveled with him . 
  the hungarians are probably pissed their station is gone now . 
  i am not pissed that switzerland is better , but that our hat is # 1 , that 's galling . 
  i 'll just leave this here : http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/07/romania-walls-its-roma/2656/, 
   i know nobody harasses girls here for the way they dress . 
  except for roma girls ... 
   westerners will start moving east because of the friendly welcome there ? 
  i doubt that , very much . 
  if after 6 years in germany , the prosecution in their home country continues they can apply for dual citizenship . 
  to qualify , the following rules must be met : - they have to have a permanent residency - they must pass a language test ( both in written and spoken form ) and a test that ensures they know about the german law system , rights and obligations , about our societal order and culture - they must have a clean criminal record - they must sign that they will stay loyal to the german constitution and will not take part in activities counter the constitution - they must be able to earn their living . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.einbuergerungstest.biz/sonderregelungen/sonderregelung-fluechtlinge ) kids and family can be naturalized as well . 
   if not will these children be send into a culture that they did not grew up in once the war is over ? 
  yes , that happens a lot , someone remember [ the palestinian girl crying ] ( http://mondoweiss.net/2015/07/palestinian-telling-welcome ) ? 
  you are absolutely right , but that wo n't convince the `` hurr , economic migrants are all islamists and bad '' crowd . 
  so basically you deny what the police says because it contradicts your worldview ? 
  that 's not true in any country i know , not even the usa . 
  do n't disturb with facts ... 
  do n't listen to anything that endangers your world view , it has to be bad . 
  if people would actually read the article , they 'd learn the police denies shots have been fired . 
  so , it 's at least contested . 
  the true title is `` stream of refugees to germany - police at their limit both for equipment as well as for manpower '' but a nice juicy editorializing is all that 's needed for the choir here . 
  facts are just so inconvenient ... 
  ** poland ** - `` homosexual propaganda is growing in europe , is reaching the younger children and is weakening the family . '', 
  -- 40 % agreed , 56 % disagreed . 
  [ 72 ] - `` homosexual propaganda needs to be limited , so children will not have an improper perspective on the family . '', 
  -- 56 % agreed , 44 % disagreed . 
  [ 72 ] - `` homosexuality is a deviation , we can not promote as a normal relationship one between persons of the same sex in teaching young people , because objectively they are deviations from the natural law . '', 
  -- 44 % agreed , 52 % disagreed . 
  [ 72 ] [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_poland#public_opinion ) ** muslims in germany ** - 60 % of muslims living in germany accept gay marriages . 
  - 90 % love spending their time with those believing in other faiths or with foreigners . 
  - 63 % declare to revise regularly their positions as for religious and life principles , showing a certain tolerance towards `` diversity '' [ source ] ( http://www.west-info.eu/most-german-muslims-support-gay-marriage/ ) you are not better than them , the throat-slitting islamists here are your imagination . 
  who 's to issue that guarantee ? 
  my point being that this past era of bloodshed was europe 's lowest point . 
  since we stopped our pathetic nationalism , things have improved considerably . 
  humans  nations . 
  also : no one is asking anyone to take in the entire population of africa , that 's a complete strawman . 
  that 's completely untrue . 
  we just do n't dig people feeding from the common trough that accuse us of being a bully while happily taking our money . 
  ok , i am bailing out here . 
  you obviously simply want eu money and not do anything , like in socialist times . 
  german companies are bought by those from other countries all the time , our largest cellphone provider is from the uk , for example . 
  are we complaining ? 
  when poland was to join the eu , our unemployment rate was about as high as yours is now , just short of 10 % . 
  we still sponsored your eu membership . 
  you are the largest net receiver of eu funds . 
  we pay the most .
