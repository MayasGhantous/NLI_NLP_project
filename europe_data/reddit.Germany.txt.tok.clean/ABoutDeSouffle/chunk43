  that brings back memories , i went there in 1993 , is it still so beautiful ? 
  just do n't expect a debt cut . 
  that wo n't be coming this weekend . 
  i do n't know how i managed to refrain myself , 
   i hope tsipras et al really reform the taxation system and stamp out the cronyism so that the youth of greece can have a fair chance at life [ do n't count on it ] ( http://panteres.com/2015/05/07/greece-syriza-government-nepotism-continues/ ) , they probably want to get on the gravy train like their predecessors . 
  can we have an referendum on cutting loose bavaria then ? 
  then why do n't they take the issue to the icj ? 
  yep , nice play there . 
  sunday . 
  the emu leader must have decided over the third bailout package till the end of the weekend or greece will miss a repayment to the ecb and the ecb will most likely kill off the greek banking system . 
   territorial changes say , there 's an idea ... 
  yes ? 
  i did not state it was a direct quote from an us source ... 
   has anyone just been on holiday in greece ? 
  what 's your experience ? 
  went there in may ( to crete ) and can fully recommend it . 
  people were friendly , everything was fine . 
  personally i would wait till monday before booking , however . 
   leading social democrats ( spd ) welcomed concessions from greek prime minister alexis tsipras on taxes , pensions , defence spending and privatisation , saying the measures showed his government was finally getting serious about reform . 
   hans-peter friedrich , a former minister under merkel and a senior figure in the bavarian christian social union ( csu ) , told deutschlandfunk radio : `` either the greek government is tricking its own people or ( it is tricking ) us again . '', 
  mostly sad . 
  and of course angry at my ancestors . 
  i just need to walk the streets to see how maybe 2/3 of the city were flattened and have lost their beauty . 
  and for what ? 
  school was heavily fact-based . 
  that period was repeated year after year with growing complexity and more facts . 
  that was an incredible movie . 
  look man , it 's not that we do n't give a damn . 
  ask any german ( except the far right ) over a beer what he thinks about the destruction we brought and he will tell you he feels terribly sorry . 
  you wo n't find a lot of people here who deny all of this . 
  our top politicians over the last generations have been pretty outspoken in this regard . 
  i do n't know what my forefather got into their head leveling half of europe . 
  i feel bad about it . 
  however , the thing is , i ca n't feel guilty - it 's 70 years past . 
  i had no part in it . 
  no one i know did . 
  the issue of reparations has been decided in the 1950 's and again 1990 . 
  legally , greece does not have any claim . 
  trying to play the guilt card to get a cool couple of bn will do you no good . 
  i guess your hometown has been rebuild in the mean time , so why would germany pay for rebuilding it now ? 
  the whole discussion about them is toxic . 
  greece has zero claims here . 
  if you push this , you are seen as greedy sleazebags over here . 
  if we are stonewalling , we are seen as scrooges who do n't own up to historic guilt there . 
  it 's not like the americans are much better ...  `` viewed from washington , it 's to do with keeping on feeding a cute little animal with peanuts , '' the cute little animal being greece in this case . 
  he could do a blatter . 
  he has four children . 
  i shudder at the thought of having him as a father ... 
  i mean , the eu started out as a free-trade zone and now everybody in the ez is locked into slavery to berlin . 
  wait what ttip brings , 
  ah , got me confused there for a minute or two ... 
  if you say so . 
  i think it 's sad , actually . 
  i get it . 
  but all it does amount to in the end is throwing sand in each other faces . 
  and considering sch\u00e4uble 's role in the cdu-spendenaff\u00e4re , calling him sleazy and dishonest is not completely without merit . 
  at least it 's a valid opinion . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ grinned . 
  oh come on , ca n't we do without giving more weight to the image of the smug german bristling with schadenfreude ? 
  he was forced to resign by tsipras because he mentioned iou 's and parallel currencies . 
  pray he does not run for chancellor ... 
  ok , since you do n't know how the german juridical system works , let me help you out : the government can not simply put someone in jail or extradite them . 
  that 's up to the courts . 
  he won protection against extradition twice , once because the german prosecutors did not do a well enough job with the greek accusation , second time because some deeds have lapsed . 
  he was convicted in germany , but on probation . 
  and there 's a new trial coming up hopefully ... 
  well , you 'll have to repeal gun-control laws , that might be a sticky issue ... apart from that , i ca n't see how that could not end well . 
  i mean , i can understand you are angry . 
  i am too . 
  but where does the german government come in ? 
  this . 
  in his current role he externalizes the damage . 
  lol , that 's just mean , 
  ** procedure for approval of the new esm program ** [ description here ] ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/pdf/2015-07-09%20procedure%20for%20approval%20of%20new%20esm%20financial%20assistance%20programme.pdf ) . 
  it 's a hideously complicated process . 
  we are in step 2 if i get it right . 
  i 'd say it 's a massive victory . 
  he accepts the proposals that back in february were tabled in exchange for a 6 month bridge financing and unlocks a three-year 50 + bn loan . 
  in the end , it could still be a pyrrhic victory since the syriza government thoroughly trashed the economy in between . 
  but i doubt a socialist government cares very much about that . 
  what about communists and anarchists ? 
  ** [ eurogroup will discuss greek debt relief - official ] ( http://live.reuters.com/event/greek_debt_crisis_4/173109614 ) ** euro zone finance ministers meeting on saturday will discuss greece 's debt burden and whether it needs some relief as part of broader talks on whether to grant athens ' request to negotiate a bailout loan , a senior eu official said on friday . 
  `` these are all inter-relationships , '' the official told reporters , referring to assessments the ministers would make of greece 's proposed reforms , its financing needs and its debt . 
  `` in the end , it all comes together . '', 
  is there a truly independent central bank , one that would never decide anything with political ramifications ? 
  well , no . 
  the accepted orthodox truth in economics is that a shared currency across a larger area needs transfers as imbalances can arise and without shock absorbers will experience positive feedback . 
  does n't seem to gather enough upvotes to be visible in the `` hot '' tab , so i guess it will just wither on the vine . 
   also , party discipline in germany is strong enough you do n't get splits over issues this significant ? 
  party discipline in the ruling conservative party is very strong , so i expect it to reach 80 % -90 % yes . 
  however , mp 's are * very * unhappy about the greek negotiation tactics , and now use the referendum 's oxi to doubt that reforms would be implemented . 
  merkel will have to use considerable political capital to push it through her own party and if sch\u00e4uble ( who has mad traction with the mp 's ) says no , it 's dead in the water . 
  strangely , an open vote would lead to a resounding yes because the opposition is in favor of it . 
   would it still need to pass a majority or that qualified majority thing of the eurozone legislatures ? 
  all ez members will have to say yes . 
  they could use an esm emergency voting procedure to lower that to 85 % of yes votes ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/publications/glossary/index.htm -  e ), 
  well , as of right now , this has [ not happened ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3cs2a9/the_guardian_greek_crisis_live_ticker_for_today/ ) , 
  no , the bundestag has to vote on that afaik . 
  i believe they could pull a esm emergency vote to get around the veto rights of single countries , but it would still end up discussed in the bundestag as in every emu parliament . 
  you know , that 's an awesome post .
