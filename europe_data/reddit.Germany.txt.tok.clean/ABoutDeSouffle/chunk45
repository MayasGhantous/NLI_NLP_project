  i do agree with him insofar as the greek governments have tried to take everyone for a ride - yes , a lot of reforms were implemented , but not the hard ones : pensions , tax authority , land register , ( to an extend ) labor laws . 
  no government ever stepped up and took the initiative because they recognized those reforms would ultimately benefit greece . 
  every government ( including syriza ) has engaged in extensive nepotism . 
  so i guess to sch\u00e4uble , the negotiations were there for a reason : to see if greece would own up or - failing that - see them out of the door . 
  now we know it 's the latter . 
  what i am sure about is is that in greece the negotiations were seen as `` we 'll meet half-way and everyone sells it as a victory at home '' . 
  and here lies the big misunderstanding , i fear . 
  i know , i was not mad at you or something . 
  i was simply pointing to the earlier discussion . 
  oecd : things are getting better finally !, 
  / r/europe : meh , looks good on paper . 
  based on first-hand experience how it 's done ? 
  though i am hardly impartial , sch\u00e4uble is to me like a red rag to bull ... 
  well , they are rules ? 
  well , there was . 
  however , since no one of the high-profile figures turned state 's evidence , the prosecution was effectively stonewalled . 
  kohl 's cdu was fined nearly 50m deutschmarks and could have taken him to court over it . 
  they did not have the heart to do this to an ex-chancellor . 
  a lot of high-profile politicians denied on their word of honor any corruption , among them sch\u00e4uble and got off free . 
  it 's a sad story , really . 
  but , but , but ... they are ** rules ** !, 
  oh , i thought tsipras had scratched his balls and was sniffing his fingers when i watched the talk ... 
  it feels good to vent confronted with such blatant disregard of netiquette . 
  but you are right , we should n't raise the hostility level over here . 
   is the case under investigation ? 
  no longer , it 's a national shame , really . 
  i wo n't translate the whole german [ wikipedia page ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu-spendenaff%c3%a4re#wolfgang_sch.c3.a4uble ) . 
  the [ english version ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal ) is very much abridged , but maybe gives you an idea . 
  basically sch\u00e4uble accepted * fakelaki * from a weapons dealer on behalf of his party and was never taken to task . 
   wolfgang sch\u00e4uble admitted that back in 1994 , he had accepted a dm 100,000 cash donation handed over from karlheinz schreiber . 
  [ 23 ] [ 24 ] however , his account of the exact circumstances was rejected by then cdu tresurer brigitte baumeister . 
   if the community rules and guidelines ( which i have never read , and will never read ), 
  [ repost ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3coalo/we_underestimated_their_power_greek_government/ ), 
  he does though ? 
  did he deny greece * needs * a debt cut lately ? 
  all i have been reading was he denied greece would get one . 
  edit : just to be clear , i am not defending him . 
  he was part of a cover-up of quite obvious corruption in the kohl-era , so i think he is a hypocrite of the highest order . 
  i just believe he chooses his wording . 
  force de frappe sneaking in . 
  good guy sch\u00e4uble , minding the ecological footprint of his decisions !, 
  i am totally not surprised . 
  sch\u00e4uble is a stickler to rules and principles . 
  and he knows this stuff cold - you could probably awake him at 03:00 and ask him about some obscure details of the emu treaties and get the right answer . 
  edit : i would n't even be surprised to learn that he intends to sacrifice greece to facilitate changes in the emu setup like a bankruptcy charter for member states or shared budget control . 
  i think he said something like the eu has always grown in crises . 
  if you repost it 30 times , i will downvote it to discourage spamming . 
  or report it . 
  afaik you ca n't disable them . 
  ok , it 's one thing to be ignorant . 
  being proud of it is yet another matter . 
  i am not suprised the sub is getting worse lately . 
   but by now , we do know what the cost of the present course is , driven by what krugman has called the ` sado-monetarists ' in berlin and amsterdam jeez ... 
   there is no such thing as `` the idea behind '' upvote and downvote that 's not exactly true . 
  the [ community rules & guidelines ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) in the sidebar state  3.2 please use the upvote/downvote to mark interesting content , rather than agreement/disagreement . 
  we encourage engaging civil criticism instead of downvoting an unpopular opinion . 
  that 's a pretty clear statement what the desired behavior is . 
  people are still too dumb to grasp that . 
  did the guy in the left background corner just burp ? 
  you are right , but no one is going to fix this . 
  this happens all over reddit and beyond . 
  the only thing you can do is educate yourself how to pierce that filter bubble . 
  people simply do n't understand what the idea behind upvote and downvote is . 
  that 's why i list submissions by `` new '' , not by `` hot '' . 
  censorship issue fixed . 
  one way this makes sense if he wants out of office ( frustrated because the ez did not budge ) . 
  the other way this makes sense to me is if he wants greece out of the eur . 
  our finance minister helped in a cover-up of alleged corruption ... 
  i know , right ? 
  someone 's got ta help him not fall over his own feet all day . 
  i want it with a rainbow background as the symbol of lgbt friendly families  edit : did it myself , here it is : http://i.imgur.com/pikjlsp.jpg, 
   by artificially depressing its currency our currency is the eur , same as our euro zone trade partners . 
  if i may help you with your argument , you probably mean depressing our wages . 
  without a german friend who gives you a residence address , this could be a problem in germany . 
  i just called netbank and they require either german nationality or residence or job contract . 
  not sure if it 's the same for all banks , but i would not be surprised . 
  you could try https://www.fidor.de , they are also an internet-bank and should be able to answer to english mails or calls . 
  wait , wait ... 
  i thought draghi was in goldman 's pocket ? 
  now you tell me he 's a rothschild puppet ? 
  which is it ? 
  prepare for sweet osman anschl\u00fcss coming your way , 
  thanks , 
  i do doubt the wisdom of our current german leadership when it comes to greece , but if they know what they are doing , then they absolutely want france to take the lead now . 
  both greece and germany have painted themselves into a corner and need someone to build bridges . 
  if both sides still are looking for a solution other than grexit . 
  exactly . 
  then at least address him personally . 
  lumping the whole country in is not satirical exaggeration but national stereotyping . 
  i 'd rather not see too many of my fellow countrymen gloat about what must be a tragedy to a lot of greek redditors . 
  it just poisons the common waterhole . 
  delete that comment , pretty please ? 
  but would the rothschilds as jews not be opposed to a fascist takeover ? 
  come on , ca n't you stay civil ? 
   half her wages come `` off the books '' so there 's no hr department to go to . 
  now , after the no victory , she 's been told not to come into work and will not be paid . 
  i 'd rat them out to the tax authorities ... 
  thanks . 
  at this point , i do n't even doubt that the politicians from finland , the netherlands and germany are pushing for regime change - and most likely those from the smaller eastern eur countries as well . 
  imo / u/theban _ prince gets downvoted because he is factually incorrect and overly emotional .
