  it never was about avoiding long-term losses , it was about the here and now . 
  the piigs were europe 's lehman 's - there was not very much time to read the relevant blog posts about the moral hazard of bending rules . 
  i distinctly remember that some decisions involving tens of billions had to be made over the course of a few hours before the stock market in asia would open . 
  we just do n't know what the alternative outcome would have been but back then , no one was keen to find out . 
  i ca n't give you numbers , but in principle it is often easier to use a broad-spectrum herbicide after both your crop and the weeds have sprouted . 
  you do n't need a substance that accumulates like you would have to otherwise , you just spray it on and everything 's dead . 
  the farmer also does not need different weed-killers for different crops . 
  of course you need to protect your crop and that 's where targeted resistance comes in . 
  if your crop is resistant to your weed-killer , you have a much easier time controlling weed and higher yields . 
  for the big companies , such a combination of crop seed and herbicide is ideal , as it ensures a higher-value sale than only weed-killer or crop seeds . 
  the downside is that smaller companies have a hard time competing because they ca n't offer such combinations . 
  that 's not a city though , 
  and we all know the euro zone is governed by berlin and berlin only . 
  that generation knows it all because it has grown up with macbooks and google, 
  helmut kohl and francois mitterand ? 
  the german pension system works differently than the us 's and is much less reliant on the stock market . 
  as we are located in socialist europe , most pensions are distributed through a public pension system not pension funds . 
  ( * ) our system is still fucked , but for other reasons, 
  do you really want a submission for every speech in the ep ? 
  today , that would have completely clogged the sub . 
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cizwp/holidaymakers_in_greece_ask_for_receipts/csw2gnn - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cizwp/holidaymakers_in_greece_ask_for_receipts/csw2g9f, 
  i rarely downvote , but after it was submitted the third time , i took the liberty to downvote all three , because i am not sure what the speech of a local uk politician adds to the discussion in the first place . 
  three times over it certainly diminishes the value of / r/europe . 
  if someone tells me my submission is a repost , i delete it . 
  well , lowering of vat for hotels caused a national row over here and ultimately led to the demise of the neo-liberal fdp . 
  you wo n't find a lot of sympathy for subsidizing of the tourism industry in the north - it makes hardly sense for greece ( like the tax exemption for shipping ) and ultimately is paid for by the poor ( their percentage spend on vat is higher than that of the rich ) . 
  yeah , you are gon na lose some bottom-of-the-barrel budget tourism to turkey , but it largely seems like a pretext to change nothing . 
   there 's an elephant in the room that i feel is not really getting any interest . 
  i 'd challenge that considering the lazy tax-evading greek has become a national stereotype . 
  this has also been one of the most contentious points in the negotiations . 
  in principle , every greek gov ' t has promised fixes , but i am not sure if they have a concept on how to tackle tax evasion . 
  `` hand it over , i need it for the coming round of negotiations ! '', 
  lens distortion helps , he 's the model for the [ troll face ] ( http://themodernape.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/internet-troll.jpg ), 
  in principle , a lot of your countryside is really beautiful . 
  you just need a lot of swiss immigrants to groom it , 
  naaa , you ca n't build cities on mountain peaks . 
  ok , fair point , my bad . 
  the most important contribution would be to spend your holiday in greece . 
  that 's a lot of money spent there at once . 
  also : greece is beautiful . 
  so , the imf now believes the new `` bailout '' proposal to the esm will cost [ 70bn ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2015/jul/08/greece-battles-to-avoid-grexit-live#block-559d1e58e4b032a39a3bb3cf ) eur . 
  that 's about 40 % of gdp . 
  at some point , the unsustainability must sink in ? 
  i tell you , it 's a genocide !, 
  [ and once more a bit earlier ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cjf7n/your_moment_has_come_mr_tsipras_take_back_control/ ), 
  so that 's about the intellectual level of the discourse in the quality papers over here . 
  greek debt = housing loan , rules have to be obeyed , virtuous capitalists in the north , easy-spending socialists in the south . 
  orderly grexit is the only solution . 
  when it comes to the stock markets , i see no indication for that . 
  unless money flows arrest like post-lehman 's , the losses at the stock market do n't impact the real economy too much . 
  why would europe 's leaders again prioritize the financial system over taxpayer 's interest ? 
  why not ? 
  he speaks international bad english and this is widely understood . 
  i am not sure obama has that much leverage currently , what with the spy affair and the other euro zone members in agreement with the german position ( or at least not completely in conflict - like france and italy ) . 
   if greece submits the package we expect them to submit , then germany turning greece away would not reflect badly on greece , but instead upon germany . 
  depends what `` we expect '' . 
  if the author is right , it would incorporate nothing new over the latest greek proposal and demand debt cuts . 
  i am very much unsure what would happen then , but i believe game over and grexit . 
  if it is basically the program the greek voters rejected ( hard to believe tsipras would table something like that ) , then everyone would most likely accept . 
  and in a face-saving measure hopefully pledge some bn of investment to greece . 
  gets redirected to a completely different story now . 
  i was not only referring to restaurants but also shops . 
  maybe , but i was talking about both shops and restaurants . 
  i think i misunderstood / u/not-so-proud - greek 's [ posting ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cizwp/holidaymakers_in_greece_ask_for_receipts/csvzclp ) above . 
  seems like you can leave your stuff at the checkout if they do n't present you a receipt . 
  which is strange because if i decided to abandon my groceries and walk out after receiving a receipt and before handing over the cash , who 's going to come after me . 
  and of course in restaurants you 'd still have to pay . 
   collective bargaining and agreements is one more thing that the greek government is fighting for , since the troika astonishingly banned it a few years ago as a part of forced austerity , slashing into the social fabric of the country . 
  anyone have details on this ? 
  i have seen it widely reported . 
  on the other hand , some source claimed it was not about abolishing collective bargaining rights , but that greece used to have an extremely complicated bargaining rights system stacking national , branch-specific and local collective agreements . 
   and it could very quickly devolve to some more eu banks blowing up oh , the german government threw their top guys at the problem and they have calculated the costs of both approaches and came up with a distinctive advantage even if some banks would get into deep water . 
  wait ... whom am i trying to fool ? 
  i am surprised about the `` receipt before cash '' . 
  it 's unusual in germany . 
  germany is * very * afraid of allowing a precedent that paves the way to everyone breaking every rule ( not just some rules like germany and france and others did ) . 
  in the end , for germany a swift greek exit and some years of aid and transfer payments are conceivably cheaper than the euro zone blowing up and leaving germany with a couple of trillion eur unpaid loans and target balances . 
  ^ ^ * the * ^ ^ * position * ^ ^ * outlined * ^ ^ * above * ^ ^ * is * ^ ^ * strictly * ^ ^ * the * ^ ^ * official * ^ ^ * position * ^ ^ * of * ^ ^ * germany . 
  * ^ ^ * my * ^ ^ * mentioning * ^ ^ * it * ^ ^ * should * ^ ^ * not * ^ ^ * be * ^ ^ * interpreted * ^ ^ * as * ^ ^ * support * ^ ^ * for * ^ ^ * that * ^ ^ * position *, 
  did you simply walk out without paying ? 
  what was the reaction ? 
  yeah , it 's true , that whole thing went completely unnoticed in the northern countries . 
  varoufakis [ floated precisely this idea ] ( http://www.grreporter.info/en/tax_amnesty_lottery_receipts_and_transfer_pricing/12462 ) . 
  i had no idea . 
  i think the only ones who did it right were the cashiers in the in.ka supermarket . 
  i guess your only hope is getting rid of cash . 
  jesus i expected weber to walk over and punch tsipras in the face . 
  i am all for a lively debate , but that ... 
  german government has said it was important to prepare a contingency plan containing humanitarian aid to greece in case it does not budge in the next days . 
  i am guessing at this point , but it seems the german government wants greece out of the eur and then deal with the consequences later . 
   i thought the whole point of erasmus ? 
  are ukipping me ? 
  seriously would you do this as a tourist in a completely foreign country where you do n't even speak the language ? 
  what 's more , usually they told us the price , i 'd hand over the money and they 'd return either only the change or change + receipt ( which in some cases was printed and looked good , in others was written out by hand ) . 
  in that situation , you ca n't grab the money back ... 
  it 's not so easy . 
  we just spend our holiday in greece and especially in restaurants , you just wo n't get a printed receipt . 
  and if you ask , the waiters have a hard time understanding english all of a sudden . 
  it 's no longer just glyphosate . 
  companies are moving towards selling farmers a combination of a very effective herbicide and gm variants of crops that are tolerant of that herbicide .
