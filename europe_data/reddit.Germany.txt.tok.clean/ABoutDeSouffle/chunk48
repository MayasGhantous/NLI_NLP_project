  that 's only true for the older crops . 
  there 's monsanto droughtgard for example , a gm hybrid corn that is more tolerant to drought . 
  there 's soymega coming which will produce omega-3 fatty acids in soy . 
  there 's `` golden rice '' , a gm rice rich in beta-carotene . 
  a lot of work is currently done to improve yields via gene stacks ( ie . 
  not single manipulated genes ) . 
   its better for the refugees because more can be helped with the same money i do n't buy that line . 
  this is just an excuse to keep them somewhere , anywhere but here . 
  living in some camp in turkey or morocco is not going to help them . 
  it 's ok if you say you do n't want any more muslims here , i can live with that . 
  just do n't make up shitty make-belief statements . 
  ok then . 
  docs over here usually are filthy rich , even after retirement . 
  it 's called deterrence - after the burgers nuked japan , there never was another nuclear attack . 
  i do n't think there is any other weapons category in history with that kind of track record . 
  and arguably nukes helped keep the cold war cold . 
  constantly reminding us of our moral duties to strike down greek debt because hitler . 
  you did recognize i was sarcastic ? 
  what ? 
  i was asking what your question ( is there a question ) or your statement is . 
  and families of mixed nationality should increase diversity , amirite ? 
  just glad that this guy is not one of ours ... 
  but piketty is extremely moralizing himself ? 
   why should u.s. citizens been burdened by the poor choices of a former government ? 
  because you can bear that burden . 
   why should we be burdened when banks obviously gamed the system in the u.s. ? 
  why should we have to pay when our politicians lied ? 
  elect better politicians . 
  i am not even sure what your point is . 
  are you pissed off that greece get 's an easy way out ? 
  are you pissed that the plutocrats are sucking poor america dry ? 
  are you rooting for some twisted form of fairness where rules are rules and have to apply for everyone ( like dr. sch\u00e4uble loves to say ) ? 
  before ww ii , people had no idea what a total war entails , what large-scale ethnic cleansing and death camps are . 
  and there was no atom bomb . 
  i love the polandball/reichtangle jokes and frequently use them myself . 
  somewhat indifferent to `` germoney '' . 
  hate `` i did nazi that coming '' because it is so overused on reddit . 
  we just had this same question today ? 
  is some right-wing forum brigading again ? 
  edit : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ceiqm/europe_where_are_the_elderly_refugees_and_mothers/, 
  maybe it was a marketing problem . 
  we could call it `` tank diplomacy '' . 
  there was a link posted a couple of days ago under which circumstances a population accepts foreign rule and why the demands by the troika were not well received . 
  unfortunately i did n't save it . 
  at any rate , it 's a bad idea . 
  germany would not know how to run greece . 
  it would be a similar failure to the `` nation building '' efforts of the americans in iraq . 
  it 's not really that funny , to be honest . 
  polan can not into occupation . 
  i am on the same page , but there are bargain-price hunters . 
  my father spend a week in turkey for something like 150 eur and was quite proud ( he 's a retired doc , so obviously poor ) . 
  otoh , i am not sure if a tourist country really profits so much from those looking for lowest prices . 
  take a guess ? 
  i mean , seriously , what do you expect ? 
  also : what / u/nbont says . 
  ahem , he was joking . 
   german politicians would set the laws and german technocrats , social servants and police force ( or greeks answering to germans ) handles the other critical functions . 
  maybe france or britain want to step up ? 
   i agree with the vat raise on tourist hotels . 
  fuck why not ? 
  media over here is reporting because of the competition from turkey . 
  resorts in turkey are cheaper , so every price increase would lead to lost sales in greece . 
  while i can see the point , as a greek i would still be extremely pissed off that those living on the islands or owning resorts there get tax subsidies from the rest of society . 
  i 'd venture the guess that the standard of living is already higher on the islands , so i do n't exactly see why this is a red line . 
  set the thread-sorting to `` by new '' or `` by old '' . 
  if you 're feeling adventurous sort `` by controversial '' . 
  lol , is it so hot in france or what 's up today ? 
  look , my country profits as much as the us from globalization , so give him a break . 
  even though his hyperbole is way over the top too . 
  everyone 's got pms today , 
  i do n't want to tell you how to run the show , but i have been mod on an imageboard - now obviously there is much more hate and in general the level of trolling and abuse is higher . 
  to keep things in check , we deleted the kind of stuff that invariably would lead to a shit-storm , derogatory comments about other nations , caricatures , memes ... 
  if i apply this to here , there are three threads i would have deleted today : - [ `` give me the money or i 'll shoot ! '', 
  - german financial and economical newspaper ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ceu9d/give_me_the_money_or_ill_shoot_german_financial/ ) - [ this week 's economist cartoon on greece ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cffyx/this_weeks_economist_cartoon_on_greece/ ) - [ dutch cartoonist jos collignon sums up the greek situation right now ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cfw02/dutch_cartoonist_jos_collignon_sums_up_the_greek/ ) this kind of caricature does not contribute anything of value , it belittles greece as a nation and pours oil on the fire of stereotypes ( in varying degrees ) . 
  in a situation like we have , they are not harmless fun , they are bullying . 
  i wo n't get into the `` but , but , but censorship '' debate , because considering what i have seen on that imageboard , you can choose between either the forum going to hell or weeding out the worst . 
  i know from first-hand experience it takes brass balls to enforce `` soft rules '' ( such rules that are hard to write down and are up to the discretion of a mod ) and keep tack - on said imageboard the reactions went as far as threatening to send a swat-team to my home based on fake allegations of possession of child pornography . 
  here , it will be a lot of bitching about the moderators . 
  in one of those threads , our beloved / u/trucidator had the following to say :  is this where we have got to ? 
  the fat unshaven lazy hairy greek ? 
   in my mind this a few steps removed from the cartoon of the rich jew with the hooked nose or the muscular west african with big lips . 
   things are going to get ugly . 
   at the very least that could mean that germany would have to cough up 100 billion euros or so for it 's share of recapitalization . 
  sure and that 's not spare change . 
  but i ca n't see how it would affect our economy . 
  nothing wrong with being proud of your national identity . 
  i just fail to see why erasmus would `` kill '' diversity . 
  no one is forcing you to partake in erasmus . 
   if everyone is getting a haircut , can france get one too ? 
  do you really want to wrangle 5 years with sch\u00e4uble and d'bloem ? 
  is it worth it ? 
  * sigh * i am getting so tired of this nationalistic snide remarks hiding as sarcasm . 
  ca n't we do better ? 
   austerity is n't a policy alright . 
  it 's a doctrine , which has academically mainstream responses but is regurgitated and spat as the truth by virtue of being a doctrine . 
  [ +2 points right now ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ccspa/eurozones_poorer_nations_take_hard_line_on_greece/csurlzq ) . 
  not sure why you complain . 
  covering your tracks . 
  very nice . 
  i mean i understand that a lot of people feel bad about how the subreddit has turned .
