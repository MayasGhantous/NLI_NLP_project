  i understand that greeks feel beleaguered . 
  but someone like you , who spits poison in other people 's faces is really the last one to complain . 
  you are exactly the reason everything here turns to shit , so spare us the crocodile tears . 
  edit : for posterity grab_a_snickers  i delete most all my posts a day later . 
  i always have and always will . 
  but proven sociopaths like you continue to stalk my profile , apparently . 
  i still hope you 'll stick around . 
  i like reading your postings and i hope you do n't turn into a bitter troll . 
  it 's not worth it - after all , we are not here to decide the fate of a country or the eur zone . 
  and i hope there 'll be a glimmer of hope for your country . 
  the future sure looks dismal . 
   this sub is absolutely fucking disgusting . 
  you are one to talk . 
  you insult like the best of them . 
  and then delete the insults a day later . 
  fuck it , not this time . 
  they can go titsup . 
  germany 's maximum guarantee volume via the efsf [ is around $ 211 billion ] ( https://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/en/faq_list/bundesbank/sovereign_debt_crisis/sovereign_debt_crisis.html?docid=133762 ) or 5.5 % of gdp . 
  additionally , germany guaranteed $ 190bn for the esm , another 5 % of gdp . 
  i am not sure about the total exposure via target ii . 
  there would hardly be any direct effect . 
  in the list of [ trading partners ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/nationaleconomyenvironment/foreigntrade/tradingpartners/tables/orderrankgermanytradingpartners.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) , greece ranks # 38 in export partners with an export value of 5bn eur and # 47 in import partners with an import value of 1.7 bn eur . 
  compared to the gdp of 3850bn , that 's not very much . 
  i seem to recall that german private banks hold about 10bn of greek bonds , that would hit hard , but probably would not necessitate a new banking bailout . 
  i doubt the german economy suffers very much from the uncertainties around greece - the ecb intervention to weaken the eur has less to do with greece than with keeping the other program countries afloat ( greece is not part of the qe ) . 
  if anything , the weak eur helps the german economy . 
  germany has pledged about 50bn eur in esfs and esm funds . 
  it would have to recapitalize the ecb to the tune of 15bn if i understand right and would probably suffer another 80bn in target ii money loss if greece defaulted . 
  that 's not spare change but entirely doable without any danger for the aaa-rating . 
  indirect effects like a breakup of the eur zone or contagion to spain , italy and portugal are hard to quantify . 
  [ more from the bundesbank here ] ( https://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/en/faq_list/bundesbank/sovereign_debt_crisis/sovereign_debt_crisis.html?docid=133752#133752 ), 
   people said what about communism something along the lines of `` does n't mean the theory is wrong . 
  it means the application of it in the ussr was wrong . '' . 
  the usual reaction when ideology meets reality . 
   the truth is there was never a real crisis in the baltics . 
  ok , tell that to fellows from the baltic states . 
  he made some friends there , including the [ estonian pm ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2012-07-19/krugmenistan-vs-dot-estonia ) : - 8:57 p.m. let 's write about something we know nothing about & be smug , overbearing & patronizing : after all , they 're just wogs - 9:06 p.m. 
  guess a nobel in trade means you can pontificate on fiscal matters & declare my country a `` wasteland . '' must be a princeton vs columbia thing - 9:15 p.m. 
  but yes , what do we know ? 
  we 're just dumb & silly east europeans . 
  unenlightened . 
  someday we too will understand . 
  - 9:32 p.m. let 's sh * t on east europeans : their english is bad , wo n't respond & actually do what they 've agreed to & reelect govts that are responsible . 
  - 10:10 p.m. chill . 
  just because my country 's policy runs against the received wisdom & i object does n't mean y\u2019 all got ta follow me . 
  nothing like an ignorant american dissing a small country that is immensely proud of it 's achievements ... 
  the economies of the baltics are even smaller . 
  they said the same about communism , 
  they are a protestant country and traditionally value hard work , a frugal life and honesty . 
  they also made a shit-ton of money as traders and new feel superior to another traditional trading nation . 
   greece 's newly installed finance minister arrived here at a crucial meeting of his eurozone peers on tuesday without the new bailout proposal the group had expected to receive , according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting . 
  i guess that settles it then . 
  see , now we are arriving at something more productive . 
  gravity is defined as a law of physics . 
  it is doubtful that future generations will find this law flawed . 
  krugman blogs about ( macro ) - economics which is mostly not science but some heuristics blended with personal belief , wishful thinking and better or worse computer modeling . 
  it is honestly not science . 
  now krugman . 
  krugman is never wrong , even when [ he is ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/09/13/paul-krugmans-baltic-problem/ ) - `` citizens of the baltic countries can be grateful that their leaders never listened to krugman . '', 
  got ta love that . 
  he seems incapable of doubt or introspection . 
  that makes his endlessly repetitive tirades hard to endure . 
  even when he is right . 
  which he is , often enough . 
  and it does not help that he is extremely [ condescending ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/peaks-troughs-and-crisis/ ) if others question his data plots . 
  calling people [ fools ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/opinion/krugman-sequester-of-fools.html ) is not exactly the conduct i 'd expect from a nobel laureate . 
  there is even a long ( somewhat dated ) list of [ how often he was in fact wrong ] ( http://www.quora.com/what-things-has-paul-krugman-been-very-wrong-about ) . 
  not that he 'd admit his errors , though . 
  everything is fallacious there . 
  op 's point was not whether krugman is right in this case it was `` k-man is purely repetitive and has an echo-chamber that repeats him mindlessly '' . 
  to which the counterargument is `` guy 's a nobel price winner , you did not show he 's wrong '' . 
  that 's two pseudo-arguments wrapped in one : 1 . appeal to authority 2 . criticizing something that has not been said . 
  this is such a communicative train-wreck , i wonder why you even try . 
   when the original argument was nothing more than `` krugman is wrong for reasons '' the original argument was `` how dare you criticize a nobel price laureate '' though . 
  ahem , who is missing this point ? 
  over the last 4 month , this has probably been the dominant topic in here . 
  there are some more facets to the story like lumping together world-leading economies with very uncompetitive ones is not the greatest idea . 
  that the transfer payments in the eu are too low to level the playing field . 
  that the will on both sides of the divide to get down to business and forge a money vs. reforms deal is lacking . 
  that the message of the troika has been very negative and greek politicians have used it to create nationalism against the eu . 
  that we are basically falling back on nationalist stereotypes that make it impossible to see the bigger goal . 
  i find none of the arguments too convincing . 
  yes , the us will not like it , but they do n't have * that * much influence in eu politics . 
  oil is cheap right now and russia is a reliable trading partner . 
  as the time goes by , i more and more get the feeling that a couple of politicians in the northern ez countries ( sch\u00e4uble , d'bloem , rutte ) want greece out . 
  and if one of spain or portugal turns socialist , they would want them out too . 
  so people should not be allowed an * opinion * on a blog post ? 
  or do you regard reddit as part of the academic discussion involving macro economics ? 
  australian stranger on the internet falls to appeal-to-authority fallacy . 
  panties bunched . 
  all that delicious butthurt :d, 
   keeping refugees in their own culture in turkey or jordan is far more sensible than transporting them around the world to install them in a foreign culture . 
  i am no muslim , but i doubt it 's their culture . 
   anyways , it is far cheaper . 
  especially for us , 
   hundreds of billions germany had to spend for stationing allied troops yeah right . 
  i know . 
  i do n't have much hope left that any side in this conflict knows that they are doing . 
  certainly not tsipras , certainly not sch\u00e4uble , but i have grave doubts about merkel as well . 
  hollande is a nice enough man , but he does not seem to have a game plan except for looking like good guy francois .
