  those are all submissions from my / r/europe frontpage sorted by `` hot '' . 
  not in the top 10 , but that 's pure chance . 
  i mean , bloody hell , one of them reads `` in defence of greece '' and has nearly 200 upvotes . 
   oh , i do n't know how he managed to run the greek economy into the ground in this short time he was in the office . 
  astonishing , is n't it ? 
  and yet , here we are . 
  if you try to disallow differing viewpoints and try to make a circlejerk out of a discussion , you deserve every downvote you get . 
  that 's certainly not true . 
  if you however mean `` a discussion solely about the dismerits ( if that 's a word ) of the current programs '' then i have no pity that you might get downvotes . 
  i sure hope this eases the personal tensions so they can negotiate like grown-ups . 
  now , if our finance minister would step back also ... 
  lol , i hope he does not visit berlin too soon . 
  i am torn on this . 
  i do n't believe referendums are necessarily a great thing . 
  if we had had referendums on the eur or schengen or the european parliament or the regular transfers , people would have voted against them . 
  sometimes politicians have more patience to see things evolve . 
  and it 's their job , meaning they care about issues day in , day out . 
  ideally , of course , we 'd have an electorate that is more altruistic and more patient and then more referenda . 
   and look where it 's gotten the eu . 
  that 's what i mean with impatient and short-sighted . 
  yes , the eu is in a crisis now . 
  does it mean it was a failed experiment from the start ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  there 's a lot of extremely successful developments like [ euroregions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euroregion ) or [ erasmus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erasmus_programme ) . 
  there are specialized items you have never heard about like [ etcs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_train_control_system ) or [ reach ] ( http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach ) the public would never care about but that still solve important problems . 
  those would never be tackled without the eu . 
  sure , but if you do n't think the example i quoted is a lie , you will never believe anything he said is one . 
  there is no `` yet '' about it . 
   is it taught in schools etc ? 
  also there 's [ the downfall of the occident ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_decline_of_the_west ) as part of the curriculum . 
   why do n't we just rename the eu the `` german empire '' and stop kidding ourselves because , in practice , that 's what we 've got . 
  you might be [ on to something ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nolsxek.png ) . 
  we are not indifferent to human suffering , we relish it !, 
  from early childhood we are taught to never question authority but team up with the strongest leader , because in the end , survival of the strongest is the goal of evolution . 
  as you ca n't make an omelet without breaking eggs , you ca n't raise children without breaking personality . 
  d'bloom seems extremely petty . 
  after varoufakis crossed him in february in that press conference , he constantly seems to be looking for blood . 
  i would n't be surprised to learn that he was the driving force behind the `` take it or leave it , but we wo n't mention debt relief '' ultimatum the friday before the referendum announcement . 
  the eu has always functioned on backroom deals . 
  that referendum would end in greek default and maybe the dissolution of the euro by the will of the people . 
  if you held a referendum in germany now there would be no `` giving more money to a country ... '' also [ cheap stab at varoufakis ] ( https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/614567635108405248 ) . 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/yanis-varoufakis-says-he-has-a-deal-he-can-sign-2015-7  paul mason : you have a proposal you would sign on the dotted line for ? 
   varoufakis : yes we do . 
   paul mason : where is it ? 
   varoufakis : i 'm not going to tell you . 
  it 's somewhere in this building . 
  but the of course crucial part of the story is that before this proposal becomes a genuine negotiating document which we can sign off on monday , the greek people have to empower us with a `` no . '', 
  the voters have said `` no '' , it is monday , but no one has found this proposal yet . 
  since the constitutional court ruled it was in accordance with the constitution , i 'd say it was . 
  not according to [ this source ] ( http://i2.wp.com/bawerk.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gr-interest-rate.png ) . 
  part of [ this article ] ( http://bawerk.net/2015/07/04/king-or-republic-ochi-or-nai-that-is-the-question/ ), 
   all european countries minus greece should hold a referendum on whether to offer a third bailout . 
  funny how radical that sounds , right ? 
   extend and pretend as currently done involves racking ever increasing amounts of debt for greece just to make payments on old debt . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  greece started out with pretty high interest on its debt and now pay less than germany does . 
  maturity has been stretched . 
  several troika officials are on record there would have been a debt restructuring in a third package . 
  [ i am not making this up ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth.png?s=gkgnvqq&amp;v=201507060946 ) . 
  unless you think the figures were greek stats again ... 
  then greeks will again get fully butthurt and bitch about foreign domination . 
  the whole charade was about that . 
  but he just did , what now ? 
  i think it would be extremely beneficial if france took on the role of the one building bridges and mending fences . 
  germany has painted itself into a corner , greece likewise . 
  it would be better for all if france tabled some kind of forward-looking plan that at least temporarily breaks the blockade and then helps everyone save face . 
   if you seriously think its syriza that are the ones `` crashing the eurozone '' i can see why you 'd disagree . 
  i just do n't trust syriza to implement any meaningful reform . 
  they completely bungled the tax amnesty that now also includes millionaires . 
  given enough money or lending capability , they 'd start `` expansionary measures '' by propping up the public sector tomorrow . 
   the mismanagement of the single currency has a lot to answer for , and that does n't start with greece , it starts with the fundamentals of the eu . 
  `` currency union without political union . '', 
  comes to mind . 
  no disagreement here . 
  otoh , realizing the losses now and in full could have tremendous knock-on effects on other , weaker ez states . 
  extending maturities and lowering interest ( which is an integral part of extend-and-pretend ) is smearing the costs over a generation 's time . 
  yeah , re-reading it today made me grin too, 
   i mean , the troika and the citizens of europe just spent the last 4 months spending tens of billions to prop up the greeks while negotiations were on-going . 
  to the best of my knowledge , the have received no money since last fall . 
  i do n't really see how that supports your point :  there does n't seem to be evidence that iran and al qaeda have ever cooperated on a specific operation . 
   that said , the 9/11 commission found that of the 19 hijackers , `` 8 to 10 of the 14 saudi `` muscle '' operatives traveled into or out of iran between october 2000 and february 2001 . '', 
  whether this was with any degree of iranian complicity is still an open question . 
   this deal did not , however , mean that relations between the iranians and al qaeda suddenly became all hunky dory . 
   bin laden urged extreme caution `` since the iranians are not to be trusted . '', 
  so the most i can read of this is iran took in some aq members for unknown reasons and on a basis of mutual distrust . 
  and now iranian commanders are in iraq , fighting da'esh . 
  qaeda will love this , no doubt . 
  can we stop getting all bellicose and riled up ? 
  it 's not like greece has first fucked around , then shown the video around and afterwards divorced us . 
  awfully nice people , they hold no grudge and even send gifts !, 
  an example for all of us . 
  that sounds like a shitty deal for denmark , 
  sure , it is the end of the trust-based approach to european unity . 
  and maybe even the end of the whole federal approach . 
   you make it sound like there is a magic wand to fix problems . 
  like cutting greece 's debt and giving them a shit-load of money , 
   we can well afford a debt write of of the greek debt . 
  germany can , but what about the other countries ? 
   sorry , at what point were syriza elected to let the ecb and the imf walk all over them ? 
  they were not .
