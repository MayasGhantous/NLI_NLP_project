  but with ez intransigence , i find that hard to see . 
  i can only hope the eu does not betray greece in case of a yes but actually become generous . 
  and yeah , i 'd vote yes too . 
  but with a heavy heart . 
  but most everything is better than syriza + anel . 
  at this point , i wonder how you can be so confident . 
  between all the negotiation tactics , games and lies , i have lost any idea what the consequences for yes or no would be . 
  of course there 's a lot more to it , but yeah , why use different shades of grey if you can paint everything in black and white ? 
  sure , but you only do that if trust is pretty much gone in negotiations . 
  i have yet to hear that the us delegation in the ttip negotiations calls their euro counterparts amateurs or time-wasters . 
  if they call him that , they obviously hate him . 
  reliable enough for me . 
  it should be `` turks protesting against china attack koreans ` by mistake ' '', 
  community guidelines :  2.3 editorialising is not acceptable . 
  editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a ( submission ) title . 
  i want them to give greece a debt cut , because everything else will just make sure that the crisis will rear its ugly head every couple of years and will start eroding the fabric of the european union . 
  i do n't want them to give them a better deal in the sense that greece gets a free hand in which reforms they want to implement because i trust syriza to backtrack on each and every market-friendly reform to build some venezuela in the mediterranean . 
  with debt cuts , the creditors loses a lot of leverage over athens , unfortunately . 
  therefore , i 'd hope for a bankruptcy procedure in the euro zone so that future crisis do n't use up all political resources again . 
  and for a shared budget overview with fangs that ideally leads to regime change a few years down the road when messrs. tsipras and varoufakis will invariable have fucked up again . 
   the banks came out without a scratch . 
  in which country ? 
  i am not arguing the banks should not have been hit harder buy the whole subprime/euro crisis had led to quite some banks being nationalized over here . 
  and most banks , even the mighty deutsche , are still reeling and nowhere as powerful as they were . 
  i 'd like them to pay everything the owe too . 
  it 's just not going to happen in this world , so i have already accepted that the money is gone . 
  - take out one last loan - default on the debt . 
  watch the horror on everyone 's face . 
  - nationalize banks . 
  use the last loan and the bank 's capital to restructure them ( they were also hit by the default and would go boom without nationalization ) - bail in all savers with a large account to keep the retirement fund capitalize ( also hit by the default ) - slash spending happily across the budget accepting a 15 % hit on gdp over the next 3 years and high unemployment . 
  cancel all military procurement deals i could still cancel . 
  call in imf for technical assistance . 
  sack civil servants left and right including the whole tax collection department . 
  - call in help from estonian it companies to build a completely digitized tax registry and collection system - get assasinated by a hitman paid for by the oligarchs and the military . 
  -- 1998 : - do not join the eur zone . 
  end of story . 
  so now pegida has taken over afd ? 
  good riddance , they will be shot down in the next elections . 
   and how exactly does he act ? 
  euro-area finance chiefs said varoufakis 's handling of the talks was irresponsible and accused him of being a time-waster , a gambler and an amateur , one of the people said http://www.ekathimerini.com/169409/article/ekathimerini/business/varoufakis-said-to-be-called-gambler-time-waster-in-meeting, 
  interesting . 
  i am not so sure about the stratagem he outlines , especially that germany ( or more precise : the rest of the ez ) would be forced to accept a write-down or even the 2 ^ nd bailout conditions . 
  most likely , unfortunately , our beloved finance minister will go on record tomorrow and tell everyone `` so , the greeks agreed to the terms of something that has not been on the table since tuesday . 
  that 's nice , and now we 'll have to start the negotiation process on the 3 ^ rd bailout '' . 
  in the end , everyone in berlin must know ( but not accept ) that a debt cut is inevitable . 
  they probably want to lock in some gains before ceding that ground . 
  gains like getting rid of tsipras , maybe even see greece exit the ez . 
  hey , that 's about what krugman and stiglitz are telling everyone . 
  only they get nobel prices for it . 
  so he 's telling people that greece will get great terms if there 's a no vote ? 
  because creditors want the same drama in every program country ? 
  then why did n't they ? 
  v-man is trying to bullshit his voters . 
  he told everyone weeks ago after every euro group that a deal was just around the corner . 
  that 's within statistical noise . 
  polls in germany usually have + / -2 % uncertainty . 
  he is not hated for his plan , but for the way he acts also , since the point always comes up in the discussion , germany post-war just accepted the terms of the victors . 
  and it was n't all fun . 
  every home-owner had to pay a forced tax of 50 % of the value of his house , for instance . 
  i am pretty sure everyone secretly agrees . 
  however , they do n't want to backtrack on the promises they gave : it wo n't cost the tax-payer a dime . 
  our at least they want to secure reforms . 
  our at the very least , they want to kick the can down the road . 
  depends on the program , between 5 and 30 % , their news program `` tagesschau '' usually has a high quota . 
  they have [ detailed stats for the last day ] ( http://www.daserste.de/programm/quotendetail.asp ) and [ aggregate stats ] ( http://www.ard.de/home/intern/fakten/ard-mediendaten/zuschauer_und_marktanteile_der_fernsehnachrichten/409020/index.html ) online . 
  the columns `` marktanteil `` and `` ma '' give you the quota in %, 
  it 's a semi-state station meaning they get public money and the state has a say in filling the top positions . 
  in their line of reporting , they are rather independent from the government . 
  they are not as good as the bbc , but they try, 
  even back them , it was pretty clear the positions were incompatible . 
  greece made payments only by plundering reserves from public banks and embassies . 
  i vacationed in crete back then with the family and we made sure to have enough cash to survive capital controls because it seemed like the country was heading for a wall . 
  tsipras wants the economy to crash so he can take you out of the euro and go back to happy socialism . 
   source !, 
  - this is just world war 1  afonso costa also resorted to international arbitration but germany eventually won the legal battle . 
  [ ... ] it seems clear that portugal has produced completely fanciful figures for the number of war victims so i guess that settles it , right ? 
  i am all for paying our dues , but running a little extortion racket just because it is open season ? 
  no way , mate . 
  hell no , what a moronic idea . 
  if anything , we ought to stabilize the country enough that it does not experience an outright social disaster . 
  in fact , even if it drops out of the eur , we should keep it in the eu by all means . 
  if you do n't want to be part of the eu , just leave . 
  not need to gloat . 
  is that the intellectual level of debate in the uk ? 
   ok so how is an apology going to help anyone ? 
  read the next sentence ? 
   thank you germans for corruptively selling submarines to my country and fucking our finances wait what ? 
  portugal bought [ two ** french ** submarines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_navy#ships ) , no germanones . 
  oh yeah , and if berlin had issued a weapons export stop against a nato country . 
  that would totally not have caused such a shitstormy . 
   oh and btw , were is the money you owe portugal from the 1st and 2nd world war !? 
  reparations to portugal from ww i ? 
  got any sources ? 
   if he could reasonably have a referendum the previous week he could have got 60 % + ( according to polls ) . 
  now it is 50-50 . 
  even the evil dr. sch\u00e4uble proposed to tsipras he hold a referendum ** back in may ** . 
  he chose to fly greece into the ground instead . 
  if that is all there is , i 'd say it was worth it . 
  that 's why each and every western country is in the same shit right now . 
  talk about growing up .
