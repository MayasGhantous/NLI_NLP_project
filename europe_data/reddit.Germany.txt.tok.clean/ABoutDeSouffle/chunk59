  they are out of the imf program , but there are still reviews of their policies and finances and they are no walk in the park :  but to achieve them , we believe additional measures are needed over the next several years in the range of ** 1 to 1.5 percent of gdp ** . 
   urged the central bank to stand ready to respond to any price pressures stemming from factors such as ** wage formation ** ...  i think you 're right , five and a half years ** and the temporary capital controls are still in place ** . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/np/tr/2014/tr071014a.htm ) - they historically had pretty high inflation rates and after the crisis , [ it skyrocketed ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/iceland-inflation-cpi.png?s=iccpiyoy&amp;d1=20000101&amp;d2=20151231 ) ( reaching nearly 18 % ) . 
  only lack of domestic demand and stability of the exchange rate has lead to a fall in the rate of inflation . 
  - between 2007 and 2012 , real wages in usd [ have decreased by 42 % ] ( http://icelandicecon.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/wages-in-iceland-according-to-tax-man.html ) . 
  for a small country with an open economy and a lot of imports ( even fresh foodstuff ) , that 's relevant . 
  yes , they have picked up since then , but real wages ( in kronor ) are only just now getting back to their pre-2008 levels ( after 7 years ) . 
  measured in usd they are still well below . 
  - and the basis of any long-term prosperity , investment , is sluggish at best , in fact so sluggish that the stock of real capital is depreciating . 
  the capital controls are the culprit behind the lack of investment , which is what keeps the long-term prospects of the economy down , [ source ] ( http://icelandicecon.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/the-state-of-icelandic-economy.html ) here is [ one absolutely furious ] ( http://studiotendra.com/2012/12/29/what-is-actually-going-on-in-iceland/ ) blog-post that is a bit outdated , but still an interesting read . 
  i still remember what kind of pita it was to travel through europe by car ( waiting 1h at the border in the tourist season ) or by train ( border police ramming open the door to your sleeper compartment at 04:00 in the night ) or plane ( wait in a shitty airport at immigrations while you have to pee and want to get to the hotel ) . 
  no , schengen is one of the greater achievements of the eu . 
   `` it is clear that the policy slippages and uncertainties ** of the last months ** have made the achievement of the 2012 targets impossible under any scenario , ''  [ ... ]  the files were reportedly sent to all german mps for review and approval uh oh , i know what the reaction will be ... 
  no , tonight a lot has changed . 
  the second `` bailout '' has expired and the money is gone . 
  so there ca n't be any deal before the referendum any more - the time to ask the parliaments for the money just is no longer there till next weekend . 
  so unless greece unilaterally calls off the referendum , it will take place . 
  and depending on the result , a greek exit is pretty close . 
  you can bend rules and toy with deadlines , but only to a point . 
  after that , the wheels are in motion and they have their own logic and are hard to stop ( by both sides ) . 
  the next default of greece will be on july 20th , and there is no way to avoid it any more . 
  and the real shocker will be if they can no longer refinance their t-bills in july . 
  then it 's a private-sector default and absolutely no money to pay pensions and wages . 
  was n't greek military spending higher than 2 % of gdp ? 
  wait what ? 
  they only have a couple of days to print 11m ballots and organize the whole thing . 
  could they just make up their minds already ? 
  bloody fucking amateurs . 
  as if you guys did not have enough shit coming your way , now you have to deal with conspiracy retards and half-truth . 
  sad shit : /, 
   maybe 5 years instead ? 
  that sounds more like it . 
  and probably a quarterly reporting by the ecb to find out early about aberrations . 
  in principle , the idea is sound , i think . 
  much better than starting yet another program and dictating them the terms of reform every time again . 
  no , forging a political union out of the whole eu would not work - just look at uk or denmark . 
  it would have to be a union with opt-outs and two speeds , ideally started by a financial union between france & germany . 
  that would take maybe 50 years alone . 
  currently , we are thinking about the wrong time scale . 
  we could also break up the union . 
  i understand in the middle ages , taxes were 10 % of income ... 
  there 's also [ some reporting ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras#block-5592e11ae4b075e173d530ed ) in the guardian live feed . 
   more cooperation yes , but not more bureaucracy and more taxes that 's a pipe dream . 
  i think with iou 's it would be much too easy to go crazy right now and time it with the two years so that the tax revenue shortfall happens just in time with the program expiry . 
  then they could claim they did everything right but unfortunately need money right now . 
  - those who claim that european political union is impossible contradict the evidence ; - support for further integration is greater in the eurozone than in the rest of the eu , especially the uk ; - and those who say the eu is an elite-driven project should think again .

  muh monies , you thiefs !, 
  seriously though , i am not sure it is a workable solution , because what happens if any externalities make the greek gdp contract again ( war in ukraine , whatever ) . 
  then the deal is void . 
  also allowing them to use iou 's as a parallel currency seems extremely dangerous to me . 
  this way they could indebt themselves again ( though only internally ) instead of arriving at fiscal discipline . 
  apart from that , it would be a good thing . 
  somehow the debt must be restructured , there 's no way around it . 
  freezing the current situation to see how they solve the problems without constant goading and mettling from outside would be advantageous . 
  see , i trust our hat will do the right thing , 
  or that whole article is a big fat lie . 
  interesting read , thanks . 
  i doubt anyone thinks and acts that strategically , least of all syriza . 
  but that tsipras is having a hidden agenda seems clear - the guy is hopefully not a lunatic and his actions make little sense if taken at face value . 
  they should switch to monopoly money as legal tender . 
  no , the u.s. can obviously serve its debt , greece can not . 
  most mp 's react like complete vatniks . 
  serves them right , they need to a lesson etc. 
  the green party is somewhat divided . 
  they do n't support the hard line of the creditors , but they are not too much in love with tsipras . 
  the left party supports syriza , the anti-eu add has been rooting for a grexit for years now . 
  i do n't like them , but their managed grexit plans make kind of sense . 
  in a multi-round negotiation game , it is probably unwise to test the patience of the other side constantly , especially if you have the weaker hand . 
  since they have a game-theorist in their team , they probably feel they have a lot of leverage over the ez . 
  i wonder , though, 
  exactly . 
  let 's wait what varoufakis tries next . 
  probably a lawsuit to expel germany from the eur ... 
  germany will veto this . 
  they brought in the imf for a purpose . 
  that 's smoke and mirrors , tsipras has to know this . 
  i can not see any problems with that approach ... 
  misleading , it 's about increased patrols in the border area , not physical barriers and border controls . 
  but tourism brings in foreign money and a devaluation means more food will be produced domestically . 
  [ it 's happening ] ( http://phandroid.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/its-happening.gif ) !, 
  ! 1 ! 11 sorry , i 'll show myself out . 
  tourism is labor-intensive and a lot of the capital requirements are fixed in the buildings ( hotels , resorts , beaches , pools ) . 
  a lot of food can be produced domestically and the only segment of tourism that needs a lot of imports is the high end - champagne and scotch , foreign chefs and foreign construction companies . 
  but this segment is also the one that makes the most money , so it 's ok . 
  guy 's a lawyer and a grumpy old man . 
  even though his mind has petrified , he still knows that the ez can not expel greece so there is no automatism in the case of a ` no ' vote . 
  and in his paranoid mind , he fully expects greece to switch to full troll mode via defaulting and still staying in just to anger the other ez members . 
  that 's just two sides of the same coin . 
  solar has the same problems for greece though : high upfront-investments in imported goods ( solar panels ) . 
  what about ekas and the situation of pensioners ? 
  that seems a legit concern too . 
  no , they could reach a memorandum of understanding based on the proposals and then write a letter to the imf to placate them for a few days . 
  technically greece would be in arrears , but the imf has some lee-way and is not forced to unleash the hounds . 
   merkel would have to expend a lot of political capital to get the debt relief part approved . 
  but given the dramatic situation , i would expect she can pull it off visiting the mp 's of her coalition partner , she said she offered tsipras talks about debt reduction . 
  questioned if her party would follow , she said that it would indeed be highly problematic , but she 'd put all her weight behind it and `` that would surely not be without effect '' to nods and smiles all around, 
  at this point , i am no longer sure if i should weep or laugh . 
  just make it stop !, 
  sure , great for exports , does not help you with your domestic demand though .
