  the next thing was a drunk french friend of my parents using a shotgun to chase wild boars off his property . 
  i just learned over the last days here that obligations are against democracy and solidarity . 
  maybe you should make up your mind ? 
  you may as well contrast our commitment to that of more western european countries . 
  that 's a bit of a weak retort . 
   you 're the one coming to visit and there is not a single reason that could force anyone to learn the language you consider necessary . 
  that makes no sense today any more . 
  i have been on holiday or due to my job to 16 european countries speaking 10 different non-english languages . 
  the only thing that made that possible is english . 
  not sure if that makes him feel better , 
  there 's also sacre ceur !, 
   it seems to me that what you are ultimately saying is that monetary policy is useless . 
  or more precisely that fx intervention is useless . 
  no , but it is limited by the size of your economy . 
  hardly anyone would fuck with the dollar or eur , because both the fed and the ecb have really big guns . 
  that 's not true for smaller economies , eg . 
  switzerland or the uk . 
  in the end , there 's nothing wrong with keeping your koruna , but i do n't believe you are likely to go unscathed if the eur zone runs into serious troubles . 
  that 's all i am saying . 
  i 'd guess that 's because it 's in the former east . 
  but yeah , all in all the level of proficiency in english is lower here than in your country , sadly . 
  we never change our ways , 
  how is it a `` neutral '' stance if we take part in shared defense of poland ? 
   the fact that germany 's surplus is not against other eurozone countries makes no overall difference . 
  of course it does , germany does n't set the value of its own currency anymore , that 's what the ecb does currently . 
  and in the ecb , germany just has one vote as everyone . 
  also , you are dead wrong , the current value of the eur is suited to the southern countries , it is way too low for germany . 
  as long as we had our own central bank , we had one of the firmest currencies - the current soft eur is not in our interests . 
  they are quoting fucking fukuyama , they ca n't be serious . 
  if western values were becoming less attractive , surely millions would n't try to find shelter here ... 
  you got to be kidding me . 
  if the eastern europeans invoke that argument , it makes kind of sense , but in the defense of the us of fucking a where the eagles soar and the ** proud and free ** live ? 
  ok , i got a bit carried away , but still it does n't make sense . 
  the sad thing is , i 'd really like to show france to my kids , it 's such an important country for germans to know and of course beautiful and culturally rich . 
  however , with my totally derelict french , i am not sure i dare to spend a holiday there until the kids are much older . 
  so , it 's tourist destinations in spain and greece where everyone speaks enough english and some even german to get along . 
  my mother still speaks fluent french and took us to france a couple of times when i was young . 
  that kind of exchange is fading slowly , i fear . 
  exactly !, 
  i do think that 's the underlying reasons for that reflex - i am not even bashing people about it , i guess it 's the normal thing for humans - a species that evolved to live in groups of maybe 50 - 500 members . 
   large trade surpluses can not be ` generalised ' !, 
  just as in the case of lying , securing economic prosperity in a monetary union by means of huge nert exports , and increasing competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis other european countries , fails kant 's test . 
  so , good news everyone , the trade surplus with the emu countries [ has nearly disappeared ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/raoulruparel/2015/04/09/bernanke-gets-it-wrong-on-germanys-trade-surplus/ ) , german labour costs are [ rising faster than the eu average ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-labour-costs.png?s=germanylabcos&amp;v=201509080931h&amp;d1=20050101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;url2=/euro-area/labour-costs ) and german wage growth [ is going really strong ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-wage-growth.png?s=germanywaggro&amp;v=201509071419h&amp;d1=20050101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;url2=/euro-area/wage-growth ) lately . 
  granted , that does help greece only so much in their current situation , and thanks to the ecb and qe our exports outside the emu are obscene . 
   and their balance sheet was getting a bit worrying this is one and the same . 
  at some point , you ca n't defend your currency any more because you start damaging your economy or set yourself up for bankruptcy once the flow reverses . 
  no sane central banker would print unlimited amounts of money . 
  i can only speak of my life time and it used to be less so . 
  more precisely , they ran out of firepower to defend it . 
  that can happen to every medium economy easily . 
  well , the us certainly could take in more than the 1500 they have taken ? 
  it 's not a european problem alone . 
  idk , i just got a drubbing here for asking a couple of catalans why they believe independence from spain is so important . 
  turns out , for those who answered their own language was super-important . 
  we live in strange times where people need reassurance from their traditional culture a lot - and language is a big part of that . 
  ask the swiss [ how to lose $ 52bn and abandon a currency policy ] ( http://fortune.com/2015/07/31/swiss-central-bank-losses/ ), 
  you did n't understand the first thing i wrote , right ? 
  look i was just reacting to you :  if the eurozone ** collapses ** , our economy will take a big hit , but our corrency will be ** absolutely fine ** . 
  that 's just not true , and you say so yourself :  our central bank ** will reevaluate the crown ** so that our economy is protected as much as possible . 
  claiming your currency will be absolutely fine is just hyperbole . 
  i mean just ask the swiss how fine their currency and economy is after it crashed upwards when the eur devaluated . 
  their central bank tried to defend a sensible ratio until they run out of fire-power . 
  now they are sitting on billions of losses and their currency is unsustainably high . 
  usually , if an economy takes a big hit , the currency has to react . 
  also , if the eurozone collapses , your biggest trading partners are deep in problems and that will cause more than just a few ripples in your economy . 
  true , but that will take decades . 
  and maybe i am overly pessimist , but currently i feel uneasy about the state of the world economy . 
  crises seem to follow one another in short intervals - a couple of years tops . 
  private and public debt worldwide is exploding . 
  the upper league of developing nations seem to be stalling ( brazil , china , india ) and the most relevant industrialized countries are still reeling ( us , japan , europe ) . 
  you already signed that you 'd eventually adopt the eur . 
  in practice you can however stall for years . 
  that sounds like a contradiction ... 
  in reality , it 's a bit more complex - you are comparing an nearly optimal currency area with a ragtag mix of countries with wildly different economic cycles , demographics , per-person gdp and so on . 
  also : why do n't you comment on that we had one of the hardest currencies and now a soft one . 
  how is that in germany 's interest ? 
  it 's ok , i had to ask my danish girlfriend , 
  that first one ... 
  that 's the winner , well done , 
  - germans have no humor ( supposedly ) - austrians lack our lack of humor ( or so they say ) he 's humblebragging by claiming they lack something . 
   because they trade in an undervalued currency because they 've trashed and smashed southern europe . 
  that 's ridiculous , the ecb indirectly sets the value of the eur via their lending rate and qe . 
  the current eur rate is actually dangerous for germany and is tailor-made for the periphery . 
  it 's also daylight robbery of german employees and what 's most galling , it 's the kind of soft currency germany always was opposed to . 
  i thought it was to deter butter smugglers . 
   his orginal speech saying that we will focefully impose on us solidarity nowhere is there a single word about the army , so how am i wrong if i call this lies ? 
   i wonder what he though about solidarity when german goverment singed north stream agreement tho . 
  you do know that the german government had no say in it because it was a private deal between gasprom and basf wintershal ( and other companies ) , right ? 
  the government can not simply forbid private companies working with foreign private companies , except if there 's a legal basis . 
  if poland was not so goddamn nationalistic and following populists like duda , you would at least think about why your country builds [ gas pipelines ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/poland-ups-capacity-of-german-gas-link-to-cut-russia-dependence/514135.html ) to germany so we can supply you if the russians start playing funny games again - like we did last year . 
  how is that not solidarity ? 
   i am no nationalist and i know that germany has an army , well prepared and this is the problem . 
  again , nationalist ? 
  this army is currently leading the joint nato effort to defend you and the baltics - in case you do n't believe me : - http://www.aco.nato.int/raf-hands-over-nato-air-policing-to-luftwaffe-at-amari--estonia.aspx - http://www.bundesregierung.de/content/en/artikel/2014/09_en/2014-09-01-air-policing-baltikum-bundeswehr_en.html - http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/nato-rapid-reaction-force-counter-russia-ukraine ( below the map , we are leading this year ) - http://www.defence24.com/233376,bundeswehrs-quick-reaction-forces-arrive-in-poland-nato-spearhead-is-being-deployed so how is it not nationalist if you insinuate the german army is doing you any harm ? 
  the eu is not a monetary union . 
  never was . 
  the emu is . 
  this is a bunch of lies , but hey do n't let that get in the way of your nationalism . 
  germany actually has soldiers , tanks and fighters deployed to defend poland . 
   care to debunk it ?
