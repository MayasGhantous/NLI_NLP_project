   but to do so any time before that will be an intervention in political process by the ecb . 
  i have two issues with that : first , ela is not part of the program and never has been . 
  it has a completely different aim and has been abused like crazy . 
  it 's disingenuous to link it to the program progress now . 
  second : every central bank intervention has political dimensions , so there is nothing special about it now . 
  abusing ela to substitute for program funds was political , withdrawing it sunday is as political as keeping it till wednesday or next monday . 
   difference between the user i quoted and the one you linked is , this guy is the europe director at the economist . 
  still , has the debate deteriorated that much that twitter is now a useful argument ? 
  no explanation , no discussion , just a 160 char burp . 
   if the ecb made an agreement for ela to continue until the deadline they did ? 
  got a source for that ? 
  calm down , i am not saying those are true . 
  they are still alive , though . 
  first , ela has been abused for months as a program extension now . 
  that was in the grey already . 
  second , ela is :  ela means the provision by a eurosystem national central bank ( ncb ) of [ ... ] central bank money [ ... ] to a ** solvent financial institution , or group of solvent financial institutions ** , that is facing ** temporary ** liquidity problems ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/ela/html/index.en.html ) . 
  there is nothing solvent about the greek banking system and whether the problems are temporary is at least doubtful . 
  the ela is not hanging over greece 's head since yesterday , there is nothing surprising about it . 
  everyone can quote [ random experts ] ( https://twitter.com/hpy/status/615081733151703040 ) on twitter . 
   ela means the provision by a eurosystem national central bank ( ncb ) of [ ... ] central bank money [ ... ] to a ** solvent ** financial institution , or group of ** solvent ** financial institutions , that is facing ** temporary ** liquidity problems ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/ela/html/index.en.html ) . 
  neither is the greek banking system solvent nor is the crisis temporary . 
  shit , i am sorry for you , guys . 
  you are in for a pretty bad time : /, 
  ela has nothing to do whatsoever with the `` bailout '' program . 
  no , ela is not a regular part of the program . 
  ela is designed as a short-time emergency measure in cases of a national disaster . 
  the ecb has been pretty close to overstepping its mandate by granting ela for months now . 
  they absolutely have to withdraw it now or they open themselves up to litigation . 
  that 's from may . 
   what are your completely honest opinions of greeks in general ? 
  hailing from a country that has had a not-so great experience with pride , the stubbornness of greeks when it comes to taking a bitter pill leaves me scratching my head . 
  yes , you can frame all this as humiliation and you can severe ties to restore damaged pride , but i am not sure this is the wisest course . 
  personally , the greeks i met i found much more friendly than the northern europeans ( danes , dutch , germans and french are a bunch of bastards ) , open-minded and likable . 
  on the other hand , chaotic . 
  in my last holiday in greece , i saw how the girl at the checkout typed 1.00 eur into the register , charged me the correct 8.50 eur and thereby defrauded either the tax or the owner of the store . 
  or i chatted with a greek farmer who laughingly told me that during the course of a eu livestock headcount he and his neighbor pooled their sheep to make it seem they both had a much larger flock . 
  that kind of irresponsibility is much rarer over here and i am glad for it . 
  in the end , it breeds distrust and damages the fabric of society . 
  i ca n't feel resentment though . 
  the greek crisis was thoroughly mishandled by both sides . 
  that greece has a habit of voting for the most irresponsible politician did not help , but it 's not the only reason either . 
  ( s ) he comes from greece , based on their posting . 
  however , while we are at stereotypes , / u/theban _ prince has a point , e. europe has an image of backwards thinking when it comes to personal liberties over here . 
  that 's an impressive development !, 
  i come from a family where homosexuality never was a big issue so i admire people who have grown out of a homophobic norm . 
   those rights exists as an individual basis and an heterosexual does n't have any less right than a homosexual one to get married , because the notion itself , in the countries that have n't reformed the institution like germany , still entails a rooted semantic of heterosexuality that 's such a dumb argument . 
  that 's like arguing a ban on mixed-racial marriage is no problem because everyone can just breed within their race . 
   the thing is , that unlike gay couples , most heterosexual couples are meant to create offsprings . 
  not where i live , the reproduction rate here is 1.3 . 
   that creating non-natural families for the sake of the right to have children , is fundamentally immoral and irresponsible . 
  because ? 
  you are lacking an argument here . 
  if you are true to your line of reasoning , you should also forbid artificial insemination because the father is not the biological father . 
  also in most countries where gay marriage is legal , adoption is a completely separate case and gays can not adopt . 
  your whole reasoning hangs on the `` but does anyone think of the children ?!? '', 
  argument . 
  why do n't you look for scientific research on the fate of children growing up with two dads or two moms ? 
  for a child , nothing is magical about the biological father ( or mother ) . 
  for them , the parents they know as their parents are super-important , but a gay or lesbian couple can provide a stable environment . 
  so what about gays do n't choose to be gay , they are born that way . 
  to deny them the right to marriage seems a pretty bad discrimination of they way they are . 
  creating yet another marriage-like instrument just to keep a artificial distinction seems complete hogwash to me - gay marriage takes nothing away from heterosexual families . 
  and at least over here , no one talks about civil unions , the colloquial has long been `` those two guys got married '' . 
  the society here has been more accepting than the law or you . 
  greece has been in nato before being in the eu . 
  i fail to see how a grexit would lead to a departure of nato - however with a left/right populist government you 'll never know . 
  but at some point , you have reached the end of your means - if a people is hell-bent on kicking you in the arse , you should react . 
  it is going to tarnish the reputation of the euro zone and the eu as a region that is unable to solve their own problems . 
  it shines a glaring spotlight on what is missing in the eur , namely financial transfers , a procedure for orderly bankruptcy and shared social security . 
  it might cement the leading role of germany within the eu , but in kind of a dark , darth vader style . 
  economically i doubt it 's going to be more of a blip for the ez countries . 
  but politically there might be fallout in the smaller states , since the countries will have to write off a lot of money . 
  will we be better off ? 
  i doubt it . 
  in a sense yes since it shows that the eur and its rules are serious business , but i fail to see what we are gaining except for a bad reputation . 
  fuck the american intelligence community , they do n't trust us anyways and are openly spying on us . 
  if they trust us a bit less , it does not matter . 
  and defense spending , just because greece drops out of the eur ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  but being regarded as a world area that is not able to solve their own problems out by political circles , that hurts . 
  that guy was a psychologist . 
  well , he wants to try out his hold mantra `` money from helicopters '' whether it makes sense or not . 
  sure , there probably * is * a universe somewhere where a overwhelming majority of people want a specific group specifically not as friends but are that open-minded that they still support their fight for equal rights . 
  i just doubt i live in that universe , is all . 
  i doubt they 'll rage , but you are right , this is going to do a lot of damage to europe 's and especially germany 's image over there . 
  no `` kurwa '' yet ? 
  seriously , would you buy a car from juncker or trust any of his plans ? 
  i know i would n't . 
  the only workable idea imo would be if france and germany started a 30-year economical and fiscal integration and the rest followed after that went ok . 
   the worst thing that you can expect to face if things really go south is strikes here and there and possibly some issues with the currency . 
  and maybe problems with public transportation because fuel oil must be imported and paid for with hard cash . 
  i 'd still do the trip , but i 'd take a considerable amount of cash with me . 
  http://www.wzb.eu/en/press-release/islamic-fundamentalism-is-widely-spread `` almost 60 percent of the muslim respondents reject homosexuals as friends ; '' - so an equal number reject gays as friends but are in favor of gay marriage ? 
  i find that doubtful . 
  let 's say the results are somewhat surprising . 
  previous studies painted a very different picture . 
  now , it is hard to say where the truth is , but i am a bit skeptical . 
  well , rules are nice , as a fellow german i dig ordnung und regeln . 
  however , letting a country fail by insisting on rules that did not work so well is a clear sign that our politicians have turned their back to the european project . 
  kohl was maybe the last true european we had , and he famously warned merkel would destroy `` his europe '' .
