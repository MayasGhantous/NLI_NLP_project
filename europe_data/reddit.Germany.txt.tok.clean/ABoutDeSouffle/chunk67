  i 'd say if 45 % of pensions are [ below poverty line ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/16/eurozone-greece-pensions-idusl5n0z12ps20150616 ) , which is 665 euro for greece , then that 's not terribly high . 
  based on the progress in negotiations ( or lack thereof ) , i 'd say about 75 % they 'll go bankrupt . 
  i ca n't estimate the likelihood that they 'll drop out of the eur . 
  no , but in a lot of western countries , they are in fact entitled to some level of pensions if they have paid into the system before . 
  i actually liked driving in sicily - everyone was minding what is going on in front of the care and no one gives a fuck what 's going on behind , left or right . 
  if you get used to it , you can do it too , even at excess speed , 
   switch from euro to most volatile currency , one that was designed with deflation in mind ??? 
  you should have a cup of tea an re-read the article . 
  it talks about the greek state switching to some other currency , but not about the state switching to bitcoin :  this makes bitcoin the ideal instrument for ** greeks ** to use as * a store of value * [ emphasis mine ] that 's why competition : some greeks citizens seem to think `` fuck that , i store my wealth in bitcoin , it is deflationary , therefore it will keep or even grow my wealth over time '' . 
  that is called the dotcom-bubble and can be seen in any gdp chart . 
  yeah , but that 's a no-brainer . 
  if your gdp crashes by 25 % , your pensions in terms of gdp % will go up , you can not simply slash pensions by 25 % ( at least not in a country with a working law system ) . 
  you usually can reduce future pensions and cut some extras , but that 's going to help only so much . 
  i think the greek constitutional court just rolled back certain pension cuts . 
  over here in germany , this would end like that as well . 
  just a quick note : this is from april . 
  soon , holland , soon ... 
  good guy czech republic  also noteworthy :  ** greece ** was the region 's greatest improver , jumping 22 places in the global rankings . 
  the country experienced an improvement in a host of indicators , including reduced violent crime and political terror . 
  in spite of a still economically problematic situation , the country has stabilised , particularly for indicators in the social safety and security domain . 
  ukraine is completely inconsequential to eu 's fate , the guy is writing down his wishful thinking . 
  brexit , grexit would all be too small to tear the eu apart . 
  now , if france left , then the eu would be done for - it could continue to exist , reeling , but it would never recover . 
  that sounds quite likely , unfortunately : /, 
  as long as there is a nato and the usa to keep guard , no . 
  if one of both is absent , better start praying . 
  yeah , but the edgy kids and the conspiratards just love the term eussr, 
  that 's exactly why i am happy to be in the eu - those plans by our local rednecks down south would never have been cancelled without pressure from brussels . 
  i have wondered the same thing some time ago , and upon thinking it through : while a falling back to 2001 sounds not be that bad , you have to subtract inflation to get to the real gdp ( ie . 
  in constant eur ) . 
  the real buying power that results might be lower now ( i do n't have the numbers for purchasing power in constant eur ) the bigger problem even is the fragmentation of society . 
  while a medical doctor might still make very decent money even if the payouts in the medical system have been reduced , someone who got fired has a hell of a problem . 
  so , the reductions in gdp hit different people very differently - if you own a small hotel on one of the islands , you wo n't feel the crisis , but if you are out of work , not highly qualified and live in one of the cities , you are boned . 
  this gets compounded by the fact that greece has nothing like the german social medical system - if i remember right , then after some time on the dole you wo n't get a penny . 
  and your medical insurance is cut off too . 
  this of course is the recipe for social unrest - where after the fall of the gdr people affected by the mass-layoffs could keep their flats and have enough to buy the basic necessities , in greece they will be hungry and on the streets . 
   after two hundred years , the time has come to take a fresh look at the meaning of waterloo . 
  i do n't think social darwinism means what you believe it does . 
  that 's completely moronic . 
  yes , it is possible to translate everything , but it is both a waste of resources and creates borders between people and countries . 
  what 's more , europe is severely lacking in ai and advanced information systems , so it is unable to get automated translation tools into the hands of the average citizen . 
  europe will never be `` one '' if people cling to their little languages like lifeboats at sea . 
  just standardize on english and be done with it . 
  that would make tremendous sense . 
  close to no-one speaks it any more , so there is no one butthurt because someone somewhere has an advantage . 
  it is also completely unpractical because as a dead language it is missing a lot of modern words . 
  practically nothing on the web is translated into latin , so that would come handy too . 
  berlin has changed a lot and for the better . 
  back in the 1980 's and 1990 's , people were positively rude and pretty neurotic . 
  it 's gotten much better - today i 'd say there are actually friendly people there . 
  in fact i do : http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1647-is-greece-destined-to-grow/, 
  ... assuming linear paying back . 
  in reality with a ( hopefully ) growing economy , there would be an increase in the payback rate . 
  the money will still never be payed back . 
  bruegel is an eu think tank , so do n't expect a completely neutral piece . 
  interesting because it contains a lot of graphs and data . 
   so i had to get back from my / r/europe retirement just this one time . 
  interesting read , thanks for writing it up . 
  you fed up with the constant downvotes ? 
  i ca n't say i miss your opinion but sure as hell quality posts like that . 
  i know , i know , this is a bitter irony : greek banks - in contrast to the government and also in contrast to northern european banks - were pretty conservative . 
  but they had to buy government papers and if no miracle happens , they will go bust soon . 
   it portugal a success ? 
  does n't look so bad to me : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/portugal-gdp-growth-annual.png?s=ptgdpyoy&amp;d1=20070101&amp;d2=20151231, 
   so if he discusses those points then he 'd have to discuss a million other points as well . 
  exactly . 
  if i had included anything from krugman , i had a hell of a time first showing that krugman is pretty biased to put it friendly . 
  then i 'd have to discuss sinn who is more or less unknown in the anglosphere but very influential over here and then on to the monetarists and how they shaped monetary and budget politics post-1980 's and even on to the austrians to discuss inflation/deflation . 
  the idea was `` eli5 '' and my own mission statement was `` make it as objective as possible and avoid the minefields '' . 
  currently i 'd say unlikely , maybe 30 % . 
  at some point we have to make a cut . 
  the whole subprime crisis is another long story that heavily influenced the eur crisis . 
  and of course the setup of the euro zone and how it came to be as it is is a long and winding story - with a french president that reportedly made the euro a condition for german reunification , with reunification that led to an employment crisis in germany . 
  ultimately that led to slashing of social security benefits over here and a decade of depressed wages which in turn created a record export overhang that led to record capital exports from germany to the peripheral eur states which created bubble economies there ... and that 's just one facet of the story . 
  why thank you !, 
  happy to hear that i did not grossly misunderstand events , 
  i sure hope the current greek government does not think about a third bailout program or anything like that ... 
  current greece claims former greece violated human rights ( they wo n't have anything trivial like violating the law ) so current greece can simply forget about the debt and future greece can again pile on debt . 
   if greece leaves or gets kicked out then your eurozone is dead . 
  not because of the financial shock , but because the air of inevitability will be gone for it yeah , they said the same at the time of the bailouts . 
  spirit of 1914 !, 
  that 's the point ... 
  thanks , corrected the timeline a bit and made some of your points more eli5 . 
  thanks for your great explanation , i had to take a few shortcuts to not write a wall of text and also had no time to research all the details . 
  my pleasure , 
   it 's extremely concerning that the ecb seems to have a legal opinion to the effect that defaulting states must leave the ez/eu did you read the article ? 
  it is not about the ecb , but the greek central bank :  athens is likely to leave the eurozone and the eu if it fails to reach an agreement to unlock a $ 7.2 billion bailout installment , said a statement from the ** bank of greece ** . 
   is it conceivable that california would be expelled from the us for defaulting ? 
  this is just absurd , fantasy-in-the-service-of-politics nonsense . 
  do you understand that the usa is a federal state and the eu is not ? 
  or what the difference is ? 
   you forgot the part where the bailout plan for greece , made by the eu ( notably germany ) and imf was wildly optimistic i refrained as much as possible from assigning any blame on one of the sides . 
  and from letting my own opinion get in the way . 
  still , how do the nazi 's come in ? 
  or is it now the turks ? 
  well , this was acquired in 1985 , i do n't really see the nazi connection . 
  thanks !, 
  * tips hat *, 
   it does n't say that countries must stop using the euro , or leave the eu , if their government defaults indeed there is no such provision . 
  however , if a country is cut off from credit , their banking system will implode and the state will not have enough money to pay wages and pensions .
