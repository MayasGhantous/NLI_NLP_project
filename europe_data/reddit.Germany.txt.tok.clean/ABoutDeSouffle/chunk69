   is the plan wrong ? 
  no one knows for sure , but everyone has an opinion on this . 
  well , we invented the whole eur thing so we can suck the blood out of every unfortunate country that ventures into the trap . 
  needless to say , we wo n't let them check out of this again . 
  anyone has the time to plot growth for the uk in the 1990 's vs. the 2000 's ? 
  unfortunately the powers that be seem to have no plan on how to proceed . 
  i feel truly sorry for those in greece who are normal , upstanding citizens and who might soon find themselves in deep shit . 
   a government can not credibly commit to do the politically impossible . 
  that 's basically the whole mess in one sentence , because it is true for the creditors also . 
  at least for merkel it is clear she has less wiggle room than commentators seem to assume - her bavarian coalition partner would be glad to see greece booted from the ez , her finance minister is hell-bent on erecting his own monument by achieving a balanced budget and the anti-euro populists from the right-wing afd are waiting in the wings . 
  could she force the issue ? 
  probably , but her predecessor forced painful cuts in the social security system and promptly got voted out of office . 
  and that 's why v-man is wrong . 
  even if he is right economically in many ways , it is a political process , not an academical discussion . 
  and he does not understand that . 
  truth be told , i doubt that would have effected anything positive . 
  you take tax inspectors that probably do n't speak the country 's language ( how many greek-speaking tax inspectors are there in germany ) , do n't know the host country 's tax code and especially do n't know the local shenanigans . 
  you parachute-drop them into the country and then what ? 
  they train civil servants that used to watch over the taxi licenses to check tax forms ? 
  that 's just not going to work . 
  first thing would be to ask one of the baltics to send a couple of it specialists to implement a fully computerized tax processing system . 
  then train locals how to use it and then staff a group of data scientists/business intelligence specialists to detect tax evasion in the data . 
  i love it how `` german banks '' and `` germany '' get constantly conflated . 
  this is not just about germany , it is about the netherlands , slovenia , finland as well . 
  `` as part of the deal - also known as a haircut - private creditors are asked to trade in their greek bonds for new ones offering lower interest rates and longer maturities . 
  bondholders are expected to take a nominal loss of 53.5 percent on their holdings , which equates to a real loss of 73 to 74 percent . '', 
  http://www.dw.de/greek-creditors-receive-official-haircut-notification/a-15767530 what is true is that the second `` bailout '' immediately raised debt again above and beyond pre-haircut levels . 
  the [ london agreement on german external debts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts ) concluded in 1953 with the 50 % debt cut . 
  do you find 1953 in your chart ? 
  right , it is where the debt rises for another year and then stagnates . 
  it has nothing to do with the wartime debt explosion that vanished after the war . 
  that was domestic debt ( and money stolen from other countries ) which was erased with the [ end of the reichsmark ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c3%a4hrungsreform_1948_%28westdeutschland%29 ) . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/06/economic-history ) : `` currency reform in 1948 -- the u.s. army put an occupation currency into circulation , and gave it the neutral name of deutsche mark , as no emitting authority existed yet -- wiped out domestic public debt , the largest part of the 300 % of 1938 gdp mentioned above . '', 
   5.5 bn per year ? 
  did you know how big was the marshall plans in germany per year ? 
  the usa basically rebuilt the german car industry from the ashes ( literally , since the factories were all destroyed ) , for example . 
  `` while marshall aid cumulatively amounted to 4 % of west german gdp around 1950 ( his figure of 2 % is too low but that does n't matter ) , recent german aid has exceeded 60 % of greece 's gdp , and total european assistance to greece is now above 200 % of greek gdp '' ( same source as above ) if european transfers to greece are 6bn/y and the greek economy has a gdp of 238bn , then the steady eu transfers are roughly 2.5 % of gdp per year . 
  so how is this orders of magnitude different ? 
  to make one thing perfectly clear : ** i am fucking thankful for the marshall aid we received and for the other european nations that did not slaughter us ** . 
  but i 'd also like to point out that we had to pay war reparations till the 2000 's , that marshall aid was for a war-ruined country and that we are paying sizable amounts to other eu countries per year , including greece . 
  i do n't see any separatist ideas in that letter ... 
   `` the time has come for the imf 's proposals to be judged not just by us but especially by europe , '' buddy , the imf was specifically brought in by the creditors to turn the thumbscrews . 
  i doubt one of the creditor states longs for getting rid of the imf . 
  if anything , the imf wishes they were out of this mess . 
  we are speaking about one order of magnitude more . 
  and that is only a lend , so greece has to give it back what ? 
  this is 5.5 bn per year . 
  and simply transfers , no paying back . 
   their primary surplus is actually positive it was last year , syriza has turned it negative again . 
  greece receives 5.5 bn yearly from the eu ... http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/europe/09/eu_budget_spending/img/graph_net_contrib_466x485.gif ( from http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8036097.stm#start ) maybe even much more : https://www.creditwritedowns.com/2010/12/net-payers-receivers-european-union.html just a reminder : back then , germany levied an extra tax on property with 50 % of its value ( payable over 30 years or so ) to raise enough money to keep shit running . 
  let 's see what would happen in greek politicians did this ... 
  ok , greece got a 50 % debt cut in 2012 , germany got a 50 % debt cut in 1953 . 
  now what ? 
  i am not really surprised by the amber and green light thing . 
  a street light is factored in with a certain cost per year and they wo n't draft any budget rules for one specific light that will never change color . 
  right , so everything done was wrong . 
  got it . 
  unfortunately the article does not present a viable alternative . 
  a couple of incredibly vague statements on what would be a better way like `` the pain felt by greeks would be far less if its reforms were spread over an entire economic cycle '' that are immediately invalidated by real-world concerns like `` the issue is that the reforms might feel less urgent during a boom . '', 
  does anyone at this point still care about who is to blame ? 
  greedy capitalist imf pigs vs. cleptocratic oligarchs , imperialist fascist germans vs. lazy greeks . 
  this kind of mud-slinging was maybe amusing half a year ago , but that 's fighting the battles of yesteryear . 
  what 's truly depressing and a bit scary is that no one has a way forward , and journos like the author are especially guilty of this . 
  i do n't see the syria war to end any time soon . 
  especially i do n't see da'esh vanishing . 
  so i 'd say a whole lot , maybe the majority are here to stay . 
  that might not be a bad thing , as the syrian refugees seemingly are mostly educated middle class . 
   after listening to this speech i saw the clear moral necessity of every state chipping in to take in some of the refugees . 
  perhaps this sentiment is what 's missing among the eu 's non-border member states ? 
  i am not sure what you mean , germany [ expects to take in 400,000 ] ( http://www.dw.de/germany-asylum-applications-to-reach-400000-in-2015/a-18430572 ) refugees this year . 
  if i am not mistaken this is way more then every other industrialized country in the world , including the us . 
  absolutely . 
  both sides are currently constructing their narrative around the greek default where the other side is at fault, 
  me too . 
  i am pretty sure the number of children/women , ie . 
  the fertility rate started declining in the 19th century . 
  maybe i 'll find some data reaching back longer if i have time today . 
  brand names are - lamisil ( really fast acting , expensive ) - canespor ( also fast , also longer lasting ) - canesten ( takes two weeks , cheap ) - sporanox ( tablets for really bad cases , you need to see a doctor to get a prescription ), 
  you ca n't get more click-baity than that article 's title . 
  so russia can fine-tune their radar and aa-missiles against the f-22 ? 
  i doubt it . 
   it has not been declining that long , only a decade or two perhaps ? 
  bit longer in germany : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:bevoelkerungsentwicklung_deutschland.png . 
  i doubt it will recover as long as wealth , work and material security are so important . 
  true , but at some point you can not stop a mass migration wave . 
  * shrug * what are we going to do with a shrinking population here and a population explosion there ? 
  at some point , we are not going to stop them anymore . 
   sometimes it takes the extra special touch of a group of riot police to help impress on people of the importance of heeding your message . 
  ok , it 's your turn . 
  we do n't actively take them in , they just come and we are not allowed to throw them out ( if they come from a conflict zone ) . 
  fair point , happens to me too ... 
  oh wow , that 's the kind of heli that did not get clearance in germany to fly over open water ... 
  i actually welcome the trend towards english . 
  if i were angie , i 'd make english the second official language in germany . 
  everyone should learn english in elementary school - it would make it so much easier to talk to people all over the world . 
  and imagine if we had a kind of a world wide text based communications system and everyone had access - how useful that would be if everyone was able to communicate in the same language . 
  europe will only be a thing once we speak in the same tongue . 
  there 's so much insecurity attached trying to talk to a native speaker in his language that only if everyone speaks one language as a second-rate native language will we freely discuss with foreigners . 
  but of course , if our language was as cute as dutch , i 'd probably think different . 
   greece will need more money , and soon .
