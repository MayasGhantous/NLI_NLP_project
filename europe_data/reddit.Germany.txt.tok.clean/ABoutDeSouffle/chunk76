  not legally , though . 
  and yes , they weaseled their way out of reparations . 
  it still is . 
  the prez usually only weights in on issues with a high ethical impact , not in everyday politics . 
  though i disagree with his opinion , none of the government leaders could voice it without getting raked over hot coal , so this is just the kind of issue where he should nudge the ruling politicians to rethink their position . 
  oh wow , we had the same `` progressive movement '' over here every 1st of may . 
  young angry males torching cars and shops . 
   learning esperanto is much easier than learning english , that 's a fact . 
  that still does not change the fact that compared to english , next to nobody learns it . 
  it is a comparatively useless language . 
  we do n't need more useless languages . 
   and i proposed a new language instead of esperanto because of cultural reasons . 
  so what cultural reasons would that be ? 
  so why i am so irate over the idea ? 
  in two words , [ network effects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network_effect ) . 
  this is what makes english the success story it is , even if the historical reasons were the british empire . 
  like every communications channel , a language gets more useful the more people use it . 
  that 's why we have tcp/ip , http and not several competing standards - people tried , but the current internet technology stack simply outgrew them . 
  that 's why you wo n't build a facebook killer site , even if your site was technically superior . 
  along the same lines , the internet promotes english as * the * international language . 
  english is not an official standard , but who cares ? 
  it is the de-facto standard and that 's good enough . 
  there are a lot of scholarly articles about this , for example http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0109/0109009.pdf . 
  quote :  in recent years , english has become the de facto standard for business and academic communication and has to some degree attained the status of a global language . 
  english is the official language of the asian trade group asean and the official language of the european central bank , despite the fact that the bank is in ( frankfort ) germany and neither the u.k. nor ireland are members of the european monetary union . 
   several public schools in zurich , switzerland are now teaching some of the elementary school subjects in english . 
  this is occurring in a country where there are four official languages -- french , german , italian , and romansch . 
  in a recent european union survey , 70 percent agreed with the notion that everybody should speak english . 
   in this paper , we examine how native language affects internet use . 
  the goal is to determine whether the internet is likely to remain disproportionately english and thus whether the internet will accelerate the movement to english as a global language . 
  currently there is much more internet content available in english than in other languages . 
  a recent estimate by global reach indicates that nearly 70 percent of all internet content is currently in english . 
  japanese and german follow with approximately 6 percent each . 
  today , of course , the mix is different and i 'd expect a whole lot more chinese and spanish content than german . 
  but english is still the leading language across the net . 
  also : how would you persuade people to learn this new language ? 
  only a small minority would do that on their free will . 
  hum , just a reminder : if we become a federation , there is no france or germany anymore . 
  just go to the [ quero site ] ( http://www.quaero.org/ ) and you 'll see why it had to fail . 
  what are those , russians who want their country in the eu or russians who want to conquer the eu ? 
   esperanto ( an artificial language ) takes 6 months to become proficient on it . 
  english takes 4 years . 
  i guess that explains the ** huge ** success esperanto enjoys compared to english . 
  the idea is simply wrong on so many levels . 
  you do n't even propose esperanto , but is has to be yet another language , because why ? 
  and i can tell you that both in the stem fields and software development , you are completely lost without english . 
  so why force people to learn a language that offers no advantages in addition to english ? 
  that really does not make sense at all . 
  the only people who would support this is the french who are constantly butthurt over losing language primacy to english . 
  english is ** the ** international language , there is absolutely no reason to invent one that erects a language barrier against the us and realistically every other nation . 
  and what would the result be ? 
  everyone would have to learn language x ** and ** english , so it would be like standards in the [ xkcd strip ] ( https://xkcd.com/927/ )  most people in several euro countries do n't really have a good english level . 
  no one is able to speak that artificial language . 
   english takes a long time to become proficient in . 
  so does a language no one speaks . 
   if we really do integrate , using a culturally neutral language would help the `` nationalists '' feel less culturally subjugated . 
  yeah right . 
  nationalists would take about 5s to turn against the `` oppressive eu commission lingo '', 
  realistically , if you hear a german government moving those places unilaterally , buy a plane ticket to the usa and stay there for some years . 
  no democratic gov ' t will be touching them , not with  10,000 soviet soldiers buried beneath them and how historically loaded this all is . 
  i am pretty sure the russians are the legal successors on international treaties at least . 
  but i am not a lawyer , so do n't take if for granted . 
  you know their whole state is built on being the `` first victim '' of hitler ? 
  easy way out . 
  i am the one who does not brigade reddit with fabricated `` evidence '' . 
  i am firmly against fingerpointing and counting which regime was worse than the other . 
  those are burial places for thousands of people , no one has the right to just blow them up . 
  show some civility , for god 's sake . 
  i guess they also had strong economical ties to russia , so the eu sanctions would hit home , right ? 
  interesting , 5h after posting , no one claims the ministry of defense , or as it is now called , the ministry of broomsticks . 
  any takers , luxemburg for instance ? 
  heh , nice try , polan !, 
  oh look , stormfront.org is leaking . 
  that 's more like it . 
  i am not completely surprised . 
  the original pegida seems to be a movement out of the center/right lower middle class who feel uncomfortable with islamisation , not with muslims per se . 
  they would typically insist that whoever comes here learns german and adapts to the lifestyle and morals here , thus rejecting a multicultural ideal . 
  i think they got smeared a bit , because they actually tried to distance themselves from outright xenophobia and nazism but that part got ignored by the press . 
  sad to see them go, 
  it 's may , you still get snow ? 
  afaik the question is somewhat moot at least for the high-profile memorials in berlin [ tiergarten ] ( http://bit.ly/1dbin4b ) , [ treptow ] ( http://bit.ly/1aqyjqu ) , and [ sch\u00f6nholz ] ( http://bit.ly/1q8e03h ) , because there is a german/soviet treaty ( deutsch-sowjetischer nachbarschaftsvertrag ) that legally obliges germany to preserve those monuments . 
  edit : i seem to remember this was also a condition for the `` 2 +4 treaty '' which is the closest to a peace treaty we 'll ever get , but i ca n't find a reference . 
  edit ii : thinking about it , i believe comparisons to hitler statues do not hold water . 
  hitler was our own dictator and there was no other party involved . 
  so we had every right to remove them as we saw fit ( same with all the stalin and lenin statues and those too are gone now ) . 
  the same is not true for the soviet memorials in berlin , which were commissioned by the soviet occupying army and which are also war cemeteries . 
  maybe there will come a day when russia turns into a democracy and will review it 's past . 
  that will be the right time to talk about the void symbolism in the soviet monuments and how to adapt them to our understanding of history . 
  but this should be done with both parties involved . 
  and there should be a memorial in berlin for our raped women . 
  a memorial that is our own and independent from victims of other nations . 
  that guy is projecting like crazy to make us a socialist worker 's paradise in contrast to evil capitalist america . 
  i especially take issue with the `` noble savage '' idiocy of pre-eu europe with keywords like `` economic equality '' or `` economic mobility '' being higher back then or `` freedom from worker exploitation '' . 
  my ass , the eu exists since 1958 , someone tell me how worker 's rights or environmental protection have imploded since then . 
  or `` amicable politics '' - that really was our specialty before the eu came along . 
  it used to be worse in the 1990 's with the `` nationally liberated '' villages and regions . 
  but still , it was better in between and that shit seems to be rising again - on a small scale , to be sure . 
  finance is the most powerful , 
  something , anything to score a point . 
  rather finance ministry,
