   greece should have already exited the euro i just hope everybody understands this will cause real hardship and might lead to austerity measures that are even tougher than the current ones . 
  and i sure hope greece calls a referendum over that so that people enter into this knowingly . 
   they 've effectively `` reduced '' unemployment by initiating a new era of working poor without creating new jobs . 
  that 's only partly true . 
  those part-time jobs were on the rise since the 1990 's and are currently [ declining ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/beschaeftigung-weniger-prekaere-jobs-mehr-normale-stellen-12549863.html ) . 
  at the same time , the percentage of regular jobs [ had been declining ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/74867/umfrage/entwicklung-unbefristeter-vollzeitjobs-in-deutschland/ ) long before the agenda 2010 reforms and is currently rising again . 
   you 're just resigning a whole generation to poverty . 
  this should be noticeable in the [ average wage ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-wages.png?s=germanywag&amp;d1=20000101&amp;d2=20151231 ), 
   thinking you can fix that easily , quickly or from brussels seems naive at least that 's why the troika did not arrive with a master plan and told greece how to implement it but is forcing athens to come up with a list of measures . 
  i can understand why people see this as a dictate , but making a protectorate out of the country is not an alternative . 
  and simply financing the debt is not one either . 
  also , who claimed it could be fixed easily ? 
  and that would be ? 
  throw money out the window till greece somehow recovers ? 
   why is there a pirate flag on spessart ? 
  easter egg, 
  it never fails to amaze me how the idea has taken hold in this subreddit that democracy somehow means a population can do x today and then make a complete u-turn the next day without a price attached . 
  guys , international treaties are binding , new governments usually do n't just tear them up because they do n't like them . 
  so giving them money without any obligations would have been the only true democratic thing ? 
   that 's like saying colonialism is democratic because the colonial power has elections at home . 
  meh , really bad comparison . 
  colonial power came with gun-boats attached . 
  greece can leave the eur zone , default or leave the eu without anyone invading them . 
  demanding certain measures and behavior in return for money is completely normal , there 's nothing colonial about it . 
  man , i hope this materializes , i 'd hate to see you guys leave . 
  what the hell is that , a joke ? 
  because there is so much wrong with the article , i would n't even know where to start . 
  at least i know now that stiglitz and krugman must be right-wing , that 's good to know . 
   we learnt that in school , so i imagine the germans did as well . 
  of course we did . 
  whether or not picasso made this terror bombing so well know , as / u/mistshinobi claims , i do n't know , but it could well be . 
  well there is , but it could be really tough . 
  the public sector can , that 's at the core of keynesian thinking . 
  however , this should only happen in a depression and when boom times are ahead , the public sector should pull back and repay the loans from the deficit-financed investments . 
  problems arise when governments start deficit spending in good times . 
  then they create bubble economies and when the economic climate worsens , the bubbles burst and the country can no longer take out loans to invest any more . 
  maybe a referendum or snap election would be for the best . 
  at this point , the cards are on the table and everyone would know that it is either caving to troika demands to a huge extend or default and most likely leaving the euro . 
  all bantering and `` gibe clay , plox '' aside , i think that 's the future in europe : regional cooperation across country borders . 
  ah , that 's a great one , thanks !, 
  `` he finds such events boring and he preferred the company of his friends and close associates with whom he had a much better time . '', 
  +1 for varoufakis , i 'd be bored to death at one of those dinners . 
  a lot of greek debt ( the one issued after the 2012 debt restructuring ) was issued under british law and would still stand . 
  fair point , we actually do n't know if the greek government has a plan at all , and of course nothing in the article is confirmed . 
  guys , i hate to be the one to break it to you , but you are all germanic countries , so you may as well just join up again . 
  in fact , the netherlands are [ our special ops gone wrong ] ( http://imgur.com/i3shrq0 ) . 
  if you have been following the discussion over the last weeks , most everything mentioned in the article has already been discussed . 
  getting real sources for something like that is difficult , because both the greek side and the the ez negotiation partners treat it as confidential . 
  what the hell , that 's pretty optimistic, 
   turkey , georgia , azerbaijan , kazahkstan and russia being european is a fact . 
  nope , they are `` bridge countries '' , you can as well count them out , especially when they have only small parts of their territory in europe . 
  i dunno , the wikipedia article rightly says : `` yet the borders of europe -- a concept dating back to classical antiquity -- are arbitrary , as the primarily physiographic term `` continent '' also incorporates cultural and political elements . '', 
  i just do n't think turkey , georgia , azerbaijan , kazahkstan , russia , armenia and israel belong to europe . 
  more like i was wondering if it involved some kind of [ bakker schut plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_annexation_of_german_territory_after_world_war_ii#bakker_schut_plan ) redux . 
  it 's not really a romanian brand any more . 
  after the end of communism , renault bought them out for cheap because their cars were completely uncompetitive . 
  it 's similar to skoda in czech republic or seat in spain . 
  does any of the next steps involve germany , perchance ? 
   isds is a neutral , international arbitration procedure . 
  [ ... ]  because of the safeguards in u.s. agreements and because of the high standards of our legal system , foreign investors rarely pursue arbitration against the united states and have never been successful when they have done so . 
  that sounds great ... 
  yeah , they have been picking on greece since the crisis started and really love to fan the flames by giving back-benchers a voice . 
  i think bild also was the paper where some other retard voiced his opinion that greece should sell some islands to germany over the debt ... 
  sorry greeks , they are an asshole paper . 
  and the guy quoted wants to force a grexit, 
  if you travel in continental europe , you should have the [ eu health card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_health_insurance_card ) , it really makes things easier . 
  so , what is vladimir rutte up to , creating novo-holland ? 
  so , that 's the professional version of the [ technical ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technical_%28vehicle%29 ) ? 
  toyota should take note and build a hilux military ... 
  the only way not becoming apoplectic over this affair . 
  australians do look white to me too . 
  does not make them europeans , right ? 
  oh look , it 's the elite-hating ossi foaming !, 
  that event was not organized by politicians or any political organization , it was by a foundation the `` stiftung brandenburgische gedenkst\u00e4tten '' . 
  does n't make it any better , but you may now stop going full pegida . 
  i can hear the champagne corks popping in the headquarters of ukip and nf . 
  how do armenia , azerbaijan and georgia belong to europe ? 
  otoh , this would dilute your russian minority somewhat . 
   they have to have a backup plan , they 've had years to prepare . 
  of course they have , most likely each country has one and the ecb has one , the imf too and the ec also . 
  they just do n't want to advertise the fact . 
  the thing is , the politicians either have to deny a plan b or trigger a series of consequences that directly lead to a situation where this plan b is needed . 
  sch\u00e4uble basically says `` do n't ask this question , you wo n't receive an honest answer anyways '' . 
  basically the same applies to asking a secret service officer how good their informants in moscow are - by giving a honest answer , he 'd destroy the informant network they have . 
  this is what makes me very pessimistic currently . 
  it does not seem like a series of negotiations as much as a mexican standoff . 
  if both sides keep it up , then a disaster is the logical consequence . 
  please do n't tell me you are serious ? 
  oh my god , what were the organizers thinking ? 
  handing out food coupons and have them eat out of cheap plastic bowls at a ceremony intended to show them respect . 
  i mean , we are one of the worlds poorest countries , ai n't nobody got money for porcelain , but still ... fuck that , if you are too insensitive to organize something like that , just do n't . 
   but there have rarely been so many extremists around as there are today haha , no . 
  unfortunately it is . 
  i am really missing a organic farming school of thought that is science-based . 
  demeter is the worst , there are less religious ones but still ... 
  syriza was voted in on a much more aggressive stance towards reforms and debt treatment , that was what i was referring to . 
  this stance is what led the troika to stop syriza in their tracks to counter the assertion that tsipras gets to define the future program terms because of his democratic mandate . 
  i still think that overconfidence paired with a lack of political experience on syriza 's side and exaggerated fears of a domino effect on the lender 's side is causing an unnecessary tragedy , but there we are . 
   cut pensions which are already at the bottom in europe not so . 
  [ depending on the metrics used ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2015/02/27/greeces-pension-system-isnt-that-generous-after-all/ ) , it is either the most generous in europe or at least in the middle - i 'd side with the second chart .
