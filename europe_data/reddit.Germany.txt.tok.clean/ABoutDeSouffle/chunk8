  being rude and hastily adding a jk to smokescreen the blow is not a behavior i very much dig . 
  it 's the same with the constant `` greedy jew with the big nose '' memes over the net - i think behind them hides real resentment . 
  friendly banter is what / u/marburgde wrote [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kn9kw/where_are_the_french/cuyu8id ) , it can still play on stereotypes . 
   that all europeans ( not just central or eastern ) are starting to hate germans again i guess [ a lot of people worldwide ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22624104 ) did n't get [ that memo ] ( http://time.com/3583915/germany-us-popular-country/ ) . 
  we are sending soldiers , tanks and planes to protect the eastern european countries . 
  without germany , there would have been no sanctions against russia because of italy and france . 
  we pay as much into the eu funds as the next two countries combined . 
  but yeah , play the nazi card again , that 's gon na work really well . 
  still , the constant picking on the french by smug brits rubs me the wrong way . 
  it 's not like dunkerque was anything to shout about . 
  well , [ it 's still mediocre at best ] ( http://imgur.com/v2ikork ) , from [ here ] ( http://www.ef.co.uk/__/~/media/centralefcom/epi/v4/downloads/full-reports/ef-epi-2014-english.pdf ) . 
  so i am not exactly holding my breath . 
  those constant surrender jokes are really rude , far beyond the level of bantering . 
  if you stumble upon greener pastures , take me with you , please . 
  this place has become terrible . 
  had dark bread and wurst for breakfast . 
  beer-garden later , and i am gon na wear a dirndl . 
   free trade zone and free movement well , you want something like free trade zone and free movement you stop shitting on us . 
  the french and benelux at least do n't treat us like the enemy . 
  we are not dependent on you , our economical links are still to the west and if you do n't like a union with us , just go . 
  we already supplied additional gas to poland [ last year ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/poland-says-russia-skimping-heavily-on-gas-deliveries/506867.html )  poland said it has increased imports of gas from germany and the czech republic to cover the shortfall from russia , and there has been no disruption in deliveries to customers , or any need to tap underground gas storage reservoirs . 
  since we get roughly 30-40 % of gas from russia , we have enough alternatives , e.g. 
  to resell dutch or norwegian gas , ** if ** reselling russian gas is not legal - which i doubt under german law . 
  at any rate , we even supplied [ ukraine ] ( http://www.rt.com/business/germany-rwe-gas-ukraine-656/ ) to fuck with the russians . 
   why not fix that by having everyone be fluent in english ? 
  that does n't work too well in current europe - except for the nordic countries . 
   yes , but all four of them are better than only two . 
  why ? 
  if you were not such losers , you 'd been having the [ baltic pipe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_pipe ) up and running by now and could get sweet norwegian gas . 
   when pipes are on our territory they ca n't , because if they try , we can shut them , so germans wo n't get their gas . 
  this kind of dick-waving is * exactly * why pipelines are routed around poland and ukraine . 
  we support you with tanks , soldiers , fighters planes and even [ gas ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/poland-ups-capacity-of-german-gas-link-to-cut-russia-dependence/514135.html ) and you continue to shit on us . 
  yeah , we should simply scale the eu back to the original 6 countries and let the eastern european join russia 's economic union . 
   germany is not allowed to resell its russian gas to poland whatever , poland is [ enhancing it 's transport capacity ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/poland-ups-capacity-of-german-gas-link-to-cut-russia-dependence/514135.html ) * from germany * because we are able to sell them cheaper gas and secure their supply if the russians threaten their supply . 
  basically the poles are simply mad because they do n't get any transit fees for gas that is routed around their country . 
  last year , when russia lowered the exports to poland , the poles even got gas from germany because we are large enough russia does n't fuck with us . 
  do n't , you are german . 
  i answered that already [ there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kk0da/why_catalonias_bid_for_independence_is_europes/cuyb5kb ), 
  well , we have paid [ more than the next two combined ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/year.aspx?year=0&amp;month=0 ) . 
  so , no of course we are not the only net payer , but to a large degree eu funds are simply that , germany paying . 
   catalan is spoken in catalonia , the valencian country , the balearic islands , andorra , a portion of aragon , northern catalonia ( in france ) and the city of l'alguer in sardinia . 
  so yes thanks , til   languages and language diversity are a prime source and symbol of culture , yes , but on the other hand , they are the most obvious barrier to communication with people from other cultures . 
  i firmly believe the world would be an easier place to live in if everyone spoke the same language . 
  and in the end , german or spanish culture are not somehow better than american or british culture . 
   if you know nothing about catalonia , why comment at all ? 
  i am ** asking ** , stop being so super-defensive . 
   catalan is more spoken than danish , norwegian , slovenian , slovakian , swedish , finnish , and a lot more languages in europe . 
  so catalan is spoken outside catalonia ? 
  because there are more swedes than inhabitants of catalonia . 
   are those languages also regional ? 
  absolutely . 
  have you ever been to one of the nordic countries ? 
  they devote a lot of energy to making sure pupils are very fluent in english . 
   do you see why we want to be an independent country , to not be treated like some ` region ' ? 
  i do n't know a whole lot about your independence movement , honestly . 
  i was just wondering because i do n't understand the importance of having your `` own '' language at all . 
  if it were for me , they could introduce english as the second official language in germany with the perspective to phase out german over the next 100 years - i 'd vote for every politician who 'd propose that . 
  having german is not an asset at all , it 's a liability . 
   for in germany there is no nonsense talked about untrammelled nature . 
  in germany nature has got to behave herself , and not set a bad example to the children . 
  ahhhh , that 's how nature should be !, 
  thanks for the link , unfortunately i get a server error 403 on that . 
   spain ( with the current government ) is trying to erradicate catalan from the schools not to shit on you , but i have a really hard time understanding why one would want their kids to learn a regional language ? 
  in our day and age , every hour of small-ish language education is at least a very tough choice - they could learn proper english in that time . 
  you already got over the scotch though ? 
  i am still reeling from all that ouzo mixed with schnaps . 
  the two did n't really agree . 
  with orban at the helm , i would n't walk through hungary , i 'd run . 
  if the numbers are true , that would be 20 % of the population ? 
  that 's quite a high turnout . 
  not that again , 
  probably a hiccup of reddit or you have the guy ignored . 
  i can read the comment . 
  hint : you are not missing out ... 
  yes , i do like the hyperbole , well done , 
  thanks , til . 
  i had no idea something ever existed , let alone in the late 18 ^ th century . 
  that cross-section looks like a dick , though , 
  compared to british or japanese , we are complete savages when it comes to queuing . 
  no , that money grows on trees over here , you know . 
  so basically defending you with fighter jets , soldiers and tanks is `` nothing '' right ? 
  just say the word and you can confront russia on your own . 
  and in case you doubt it : - http://www.aco.nato.int/raf-hands-over-nato-air-policing-to-luftwaffe-at-amari--estonia.aspx - http://www.bundesregierung.de/content/en/artikel/2014/09_en/2014-09-01-air-policing-baltikum-bundeswehr_en.html - http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/nato-rapid-reaction-force-counter-russia-ukraine ( below the map , we are leading this year ) - http://www.defence24.com/233376,bundeswehrs-quick-reaction-forces-arrive-in-poland-nato-spearhead-is-being-deployed, 
  are you missing the good old times where we used our tanks to pursue our interests ? 
  in the reaction to the refugees , you can clearly see the demarcation line between the former warsaw pact where everyone was living just for himself and empathy was punished and the more benign and less egoistical west . 
  i guess the military presence and help we do is not worth mentioning ?

  it would look disorderly if there were only mud-paths . 
  that 's the best-looking u-boat we ever built if it is real . 
  he has to make room for a swedish cosmonaut ... 
  your writing is pretty coherent for that level of drunkenness . 
  i am impressed . 
  that 's the sad truth , but i have hope the balkans is oh so slowly moving away from this hatred . 
  i do n't . 
  i just do n't think it 's appropriate at this news and as a foreigner to demand serbia does this or that . 
  i am not indifferent to the different levels of guilt here , i just think if the former bad guy does the right thing , he deserves a part on the back . 
  letting the mob set the standard of human civilization , what could go wrong ? 
  men always see other men as competition and a thread . 
  in the end , it 's all about access to women and fear about safety . 
  there 's hardly any solidarity .
