  at any rate in 2012 it was not significantly worse than germany 's [ and much more expensive ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/11291209/greece-spends-more-on-pensions-than-uk.html ) than say the system in the uk . 
  maybe i am missing pension cuts since then , but those are the latest numbers i could find , and [ oecd also mentions only cuts for high pensions ] ( https://www.oecd.org/greece/oecd-pensionsataglance-2013-highlights-greece.pdf ) . 
  if i am wrong i would be thankful for an up-to-date figure . 
   it is no coincidence that the eu is demanding greece hand over its energy infrastructure merely months/1 -2 years before greece transforms the economy into a energy export based one dude , please . 
  the absolute last thing you want is a state-owned energy/natural resources industry that dominates the economy . 
  that 's a sure-fire recipe for corruption and crony-capitalism on a russian scale ( yes , i know in russia it is quasi-privatised ) . 
  it is much better to sell concessions to foreign investors - they bring in direct investment ( after all , they have the capital to do so ) and have to pay taxes as well as fees for the concessions . 
  this way , you at least have the chance to create an efficient energy economy without a nightmare of corruption . 
  if i take switzerland as an example of direct democracy , i am underwhelmed . 
  the country is rich , but also extremely conservative , xenophobic and very much focused on itself . 
  the party with the most influence , svp , is a right-wing , nationalist and populist party . 
  switzerland was really late to gender equality , otoh they were early for gay rights . 
  personally , i think it is a case of projecting discontent outwards , on a common enemy to avoid feelings of failure , helplessness and hopelessness . 
  i do n't think it has much substance - the ecb as the rest of the troika set up a tough reform agenda for greece to follow , even way before syriza came to power . 
  the party was elected on the promise of rejecting the demands and abolish austerity , but this was illusionary from the beginning . 
  so yes , there is a real conflict between the greek government and the troika and i bet the troika would not budge just to save syriza . 
  i do believe there is real fear about moral hazard should greece get preferential treatment without reforms . 
  i see no indication that someone is using the ecb as a tool and pulling strings in the background - the conflict lines are pretty clear . 
  refugees typically want to go to the richer countries like germany or sweden or the uk , because english is the native language there . 
  probably you are right . 
  extremists of every color never fail to amaze me with their furor over destroying `` the system '' without giving a second thought about what happens then . 
  will the new order be without `` a system '' ? 
  or will a new system be better ? 
  for whom , in which regard ? 
  oh come on , that 's not true . 
  / u/naurgul is defending a left-wing position , but not to polarize or troll , but as far as i can see , out of conviction . 
  i usually do n't share his point of view , but at least he is capable of sourcing a lot of his claims - in contrast to a lot of / r/europe members . 
  so even if he occupies a minority position , it is disingenuous to constantly downvote him or accuse him of not contributing anything . 
  but most likely , a sudden grexit will be an economic horror show , much worse than the last 5 years . 
   the 19-nation bloc 's finance ministers were riled after greek prime minister alexis tsipras 's tried to bypass their veto on financial aid with an appeal to angela merkel on thursday . 
  tsipras sought to circumvent the finance ministers ' authority , pleading his case with the german chancellor and french president francois hollande on the sidelines of a summit on immigration in brussels . 
   `` i would describe today 's meeting as a complete breakdown in communication with greece , '' maltese finance minister edward scicluna said . 
  ugh , i do n't know what tsipras was thinking , but they way he and varoufakis are playing their game , this is not ending well . 
  either they are completely delusional considering due process and believe in some kind of benevolent dictatorship where currying favor with the queen allows you to gain additional money , or they want to eject greece from the euro and at the same time are looking for somebody to blame . 
  edit : or they really are as amateurish as they seem , but i held a higher opinion of varoufakis . 
   hurr durr syriza has already destroyed the economy in 2 months which is not what / u/our _ best_friend wrote , but adjusting for some hyperbole , it is not completely unreasonable either , given that people seem to vote with their bank accounts : http://media.gotraffic.net/images/isdjsgxmdeqs/v241/-1x-1.jpg ( from [ here ] ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-20/greece-s-agony-in-one-scary-chart ) ) . 
  the outflows started when syriza was the leading candidate and more than doubled when they came into office . 
  there are several ways to damage an economy and causing capital flight is one of them . 
  you may not like it , but there are at least signs the crisis has bottomed out . 
  primary surplus is up : http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/19/opinion/041915krugman1/041915krugman1-blog480.png ( linked from [ krugman ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/notes-on-greece/ ) ) . 
  gdp and wage growth/contraction seems to have hit a turning point : http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/template/assets/img/greece-gdp-wages.gif , and even house prices seem to have stabilized : http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/template/assets/img/greece-house-prices-urban.gif ( both from http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/europe/greece/price-history ) . 
  is everything hunky-dory ? 
  not by a long shot . 
  is the worst over ? 
  could very well be unless the current government tries to prove a point and ejects greece from the euro zone . 
  come on , man , there is a lot in the first google pages : - https://web.archive.org/web/20070307132947/http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/organic/standards/pdf/compendium.pdf - http://woolshed1.blogspot.de/2009/01/sheep-farm-husbandry-organic-farming.html - http://www.alternativevet.org/ws127-07.pdf also the whole `` rudolf steiner '' school of organic farming , one of the largest associations for organic growers is [ demeter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demeter_international ) , and their `` biodynamic '' method for soil fertilization is [ pretty close ] ( http://www.bio-obst-clostermann.de/en/demeter-farming.php ) and intimately related to homeopathy . 
  their method of choice for treating sick animals is of course homeopathy , considering their [ anthroposophy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthroposophy ) background . 
  moderate discontent helps , the country does not become complacent and is open to change . 
  there 's a polanball strip waiting to be drawn ... 
  not exactly pedobear , but close ... 
  gerxit does not have the same ring ... 
  where is teh proofs ? 
  common heritage and history , geographical location in one special corner of the world and the will to stop knocking each other on the head . 
  11/10 , well done , vladimir vladimirovich . 
  i know , but first it is quite a normal `` medication '' in organic farming . 
  secondly , i would not want people to think it applies to all fish farming . 
  this only applies to organic fish , nothing will change for the majority of fish producers . 
  [ kenan malik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kenan_malik ) is a brit . 
  but yeah , he 's a proponent of an open borders policy , so the article is not that surprising . 
  most likely he 'd write the same about the us border . 
  that 's not true . 
  if you come to berlin , there are large parts of the city were you easily can live without speaking a lot of german . 
  and really no one will care if you are a native german or an immigrant . 
  in the more rural areas , the attitude towards migrants will be less welcoming , though . 
  however , do n't expect parties for your welcome , we just are not like that - if we do n't reject you it means you are welcome . 
  and broadly speaking , it depends on your level of education - if you have a good qualification , then you 'll make it . 
  anecdotal : in the company i am working in , my boss is russian , one colleague is persian , another from bulgaria , one from italy and the department lead is french . 
  all in a department of 12 people and no animosity i have observed . 
  when it comes to refugees , illegal immigrants and gypsies , the attitude is different though . 
  yeah , we a also have this kind of a divide , but not a farmer 's party or something like it . 
  but berlin is widely regarded as a green-vegan-hipster paradise , whereas more rural states are typically more conservative as well - bavaria would be the prime example . 
  since bavaria has their own local branch of the ruling cdu , and since bavaria is really populous , they have an insane influence on our national politics . 
  because python sucks , 
   the overheating is a problem , but is it really that large of a problem ? 
  i read that after shooting two clips , only 50 % of slugs hit , after three , only 1/3 . 
  so that would be a problem all-right . 
  speak : - german - english - ruby - javascript - java would like to : - chinese ( great country and there are loads of chinese people ) - clojure ( lispy languages are great ) - haskell ( makes my head spin ), 
  i still wonder why someone like sch\u00e4uble insists on the 4.5 % primary surplus target after being german finance minister and having a hell of a time sustaining [ more than 2.5 % primary surplus ] ( http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?series_key=121.gst.q.de.n.d1300.pdf.d0000.cu.g ) . 
   but i wonder what the nature of german arms development and its export industry is going to be . 
  probably dark . 
  even our leopard ii panzers are not enough to save kmw from [ a merger with nexter ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/land/vehicles/2015/03/19/france-leopard-tank-nexter-germany-leclerc-holding-company/25023543/ ) , a french company . 
  and now this disaster . 
  i wonder which rifle the bundeswehr is going to adopt , but i would n't be surprised if it was a a modified g36 , just improved enough to meet requirements . 
  the harsh words from our defense minister should not surprise anyone - bundeswehr procurement is a nightmare and has been one for some years . 
  her predecessor was fired because of the delays and cost overruns in several programs , prominently the a400m and nh90 . 
  so , she is trying to take the lead with the g36 . 
   i do n't believe that a same-sex couple is as valuable in rising children as a marriage that may be your opinion , but the [ genie is out of the bottle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_parenting ) already , meaning there are thousands of gay or lesbian couples with kids . 
  now the state can simply recognize this and allow homosexuals to also adopt kids , or not . 
  but even if not , this will not make lgbt parents go away again . 
  they are here to stay - at least in europe where some fundamental rights are guaranteed . 
  and just to quote from the article :  scientific research consistently shows that gay and lesbian parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents , and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as those reared by heterosexual parents . 
  major associations of mental health professionals in the u.s. , canada , and australia have not identified credible empirical research that suggests otherwise . 
  so while you certainly have the right to your opinion , i 'd invite you to accept that scientific evidence is not on your side . 
   come to think of it i would like to know whether there are other european magazines that translate some of their articles in english there is '' [ le monde diplomatique ] ( http://mondediplo.com/ ) '' , but that 's boring as hell . 
   they 've been heralding the collapse of the euro for so long in an `` aaaany second now '' fashion but really , is there any british ( and to an extend us-american ) news mag that 's different in this ? 
  they all sound like a milder form of evans-pritchard from the telegraph . 
  there * is * a lot wrong with the eur , but in 2 years , `` eur endgame just around the corner '' will be 10 years old . 
   but these are inevitable consequences of marriage , are they not ? 
  not necessarily , in germany surrogates are not allowed for anyone and while the mother will not be prosecuted , anyone assisting her will . 
   tsipras has done a terrible job .
