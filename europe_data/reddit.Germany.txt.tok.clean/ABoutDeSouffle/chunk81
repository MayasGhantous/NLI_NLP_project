  compared with the rest of europe 's leaders , he looks like a statesman . 
  from the same author who loves subtle and nuanced articles like : - * who made germany europe 's boss ? 
  * - today , greece . 
  but which eu member will germany try to bully tomorrow ? 
  - * europe 's choice : euro or democracy * - * get ready for britain 's constitutional crisis * - * feckless europe kowtows to china * - for many years yet , the u.s. will be the world 's pre-eminent power . 
  a europe intent on disarming itself had better pray this state of affairs continues, 
   it is simply outrageous how puritanicals you so-called `` libertarians '' act . 
  i can see where this is heading ... 
  no , the article suggests that the problem of france is not taking a more active role , mediating between germany and the south . 
   i do n't recall anyone saying anything like that . 
  i read nothing like that either - and most likely , german media would have made a big fuss over something like that . 
  i think the article exaggerates . 
  the majority of germans backs sanctions against russia , so there is no divide between population and government . 
  what is true , however , is that german politics was caught off-guard when russia started this war , and it questions some of our convictions . 
  it 's faith-based economics . 
  i 'd really like to know if they are using an actual model and if it is available to see what happens if you set some parameters differently - or if they completely disregard dynamics and simply extrapolate from `` 1m immigrants equal 1 % more gdp , so 100m immigrants equal 100 % more gdp '', 
   before considering whether they had the means to travel , i would suggest that the figure should be closer to 100 million people than a billion your article says : `` about 13 % of the world 's adults -- or about 630 million people -- say they would like to leave their country and move somewhere else permanently . 
  for roughly 138 million people , that somewhere else would be the u.s '' now , as most countries have pretty high hurdles on immigration ( both legal and illegal ) , you ** must ** factor in that an open borders policy in one country or bloc of countries would instantaneously shift the balance of preferred destinations towards the one with the best mix of security , wealth and ease of access - that being the eu . 
  so , we are probably talking about maybe * 300m * to * 500m * , give or take a couple of million . 
  what 's more , those numbers are only adults as the article says . 
  probably if the father wants to move to the eu , the mother and children would follow - maybe not in the first years , but quite likely later on . 
  number of children is higher in poorer countries , but let 's just say for every person that wants to move , 1.5 persons will follow . 
  now , we are talking about maybe * 750m * to * 1.25 bn * new residents . 
  and of course , that 's only the initial wave . 
  if we kept borders open , the word gets around and more would move . 
  hard to quantify , but it is not hard to do that math and see that a few years down the road , natives would become a minority in europe . 
  i do n't for a second believe this is going to raise gdp over here . 
  i do n't either believe wages will be stable or social security systems can handle that . 
   i would speculate the improvement in gdp should partially insulate against the cultural costs how would you insulate against cultural costs , ie . 
  ghettos , parallel societies and worsening security for natives ? 
  how do you pay for imported homophobe and misogynist attitudes ? 
   is he implying we should have completely open borders where anyone can take a plane and just settle in the eu ? 
  `` let everybody in '' is pretty clear , is n't it ? 
  probably the usa . 
  sometimes outside forces are n't so bad and the us has a big-ass army . 
  considering this would probably revive the old british/french hostility , i am all for it . 
  would be nice to see someone else start a war in europe for a change . 
  we do n't have the death penalty in the eu , you know . 
  as the article says , it 's more a symbolic thing . 
  i hope he does not go to jail over it , that would be overly strict ( heartless , imo ) , but i still think it is a good thing to put him on trial . 
  i know next to nothing about georgia , but since they have this latent border conflict with russia , i 'd rather not have them as a eu member state . 
  their corruption seems to be [ moderate ] ( http://transparency.ge/en/node/4846 ) , but i am not totally stoked to get another [ poor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) country on board . 
  i 'd rather see the eu stabilize before admitting countries that are really far from central europe . 
  and then , there 's the smoldering conflict between the german constitutional court and the ecj ( [ in german ] ( http://www.verfassungsblog.de/hochrangige-juristen-fordern-fesseln-fur-karlsruhe/ ) ) . 
   a 93-year-old man who was assigned to confiscate the luggage of prisoners arriving at auschwitz concentration camp in his capacity as an ss guard has gone on trial in germany , charged with complicity in the murder of 300,000 holocaust victims . 
   oskar gr\u00f6ning , referred to as ` the accountant of auschwitz ' , is standing trial in the north german town of l\u00fcneburg in what is a hugely symbolic act as part of authorities ' last-ditch attempt to put the handful of remaining nazi death camp guards in the dock before they die . 
  i doubt it has anything to do with greece vs. your country . 
  chomsky has always been left , so it 's more or less a given he 'd support syriza and their plans . 
  not that i 'd agree with him , though . 
  because we in germany are a saturated bunch who cares jack shit about the economy - which is running on autopilot currently . 
  someone got the text , please ? 
  exactly what europe needs - an aging sleaze-bag on heavy painkillers . 
  as if a bitter cripple as germany 's financial minister was n't bad enough . 
  that 's why he is so keen on conducting backroom negotiations and sticking wrenches in the other 's gears . 
  junkers is a dream come true for tsipras . 
   designed in a style that somehow fused the late work of le corbusier with scottish baronial castles , it seemed both controversial and somehow right . 
  i can kind of understand the fascination with the socialist building , but why anyone would shed a tear over the seminary is beyond me . 
  that 's just a cheap , faceless 60 's building . 
  maybe some old fart still remembers `` yes ( prime ) minister '' - there was one [ episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ) where they talk about exactly this . 
  it is 20 years old , but eerily relevant today . 
  and no , i do n't think the uk would , probably not the us either . 
  i wonder what the commercial banks get in return , [ ious ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iou ) ? 
  the way it is extremely left-aligned , you 'd expect another message that would be revealed later . 
  but maybe that 's all there is . 
  personally , i believe this disclaimer should be standard in economics . 
  it is one of the worst sciences because large-scale experiments are hard to do so everyone is reading tea-leafs and bending figures to fit tales . 
  dear old krugman is an expert in this , just reading the linked piece :  high debt , and inflated costs and prices that left the country uncompetitive . 
  that 's all there was , huh ? 
  nothing about structural problems like [ lack of larger companies ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=epsgawaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa108&amp;lpg=pa108&amp;dq=average+company+size+greece&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=czh6ymurhi&amp;sig=00cxszf6w3bfcuzg81mjg1aedn8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=6fk0vcoiemm7oohogigj&amp;ved=0cbgq6aewaq ) , resulting in a lack of innovation . 
  or a couple of the other well-known problems . 
  but yeah , if you are a macro-economics prof , you only have so many hammers . 
  depends which turks . 
  those living in germany will mostly not care that much , but the official turkey will be butthurt . 
  no way . 
  where i live , we have since the 1990 's had a massive influx of educated middle-class russians looking for a better life . 
  they seem to integrate pretty well , cause relatively few problems and are eager to learn german . 
  my boss , being one of them , even germanized his name . 
  pretty sure he wo n't go back to russia . 
  i feel bad for being fascinated on the backs of people who have to emigrate , but i start asking myself if this is the beginning of a european federal identity - where people migrate all over the eu like us-americans do . 
  first-world problems at their worst !, 
  heh , makes sense , thanks , 
  seriously , what kind of viral campaign is that ? 
  first the nazi/islam-poster , now that ... 
  all countries that ever engaged in the slave trade should offer a sincere and highly official apology - there is hardly a worse crime . 
  all ex-colonial powers should apologize for their looting and plundering under the pretext of `` white man 's burden '' . 
  and it would be nice if the eastern european nations found the heart to apologize or at least recognize the injustice of driving out forcefully millions of german descent after the war . 
  yes , among those were a lot of nazis , but still - the brutal expulsion was a crime . 
  it opens the way for reconciliation . 
  people often want an apology more than the perpetrator punished . 
  cry me a river . 
  a subreddit without blatant racism is a better subreddit in my eyes . 
  yes , mods remove posts , that 's their job . 
  no need to get all salty about that . 
  very good post , til a lot , thanks !, 
  i dunno , but if the current wto courts do n't work to resolve those pretty obvious cases like the one i cited , why would private courts staffed by highly-paid us attorneys work any better for european companies ? 
  the us gov ' t knows it has enough leverage to deter any company and failing that will most likely win in the isds courts . 
  only this was not about state benefits , this was pretty obvious cheating . 
  i am confused , why would n't you trust the german government ? 
   if the american government , whether state or federal , started purposefully discriminating against airbus to benefit boeing no to derail the thread too much , but exactly that [ has been happening ] ( http://www.dailytech.com/boeing+wins+protest+against+northrop+grumman+eads+tanker+deal/article12142.htm ) and i doubt the us govt will stop doing this because of ttip . 
  what has austria to do with northwest europe ?
