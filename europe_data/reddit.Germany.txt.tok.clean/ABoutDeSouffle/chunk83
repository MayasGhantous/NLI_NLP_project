  hell , what 's going on in the balkan lately ? 
  are you guys preparing the next war ? 
  interesting , what will gardeners and those working in production say ? 
  and where does the law draw the line , i.e. 
  who decides if an employee is eligible for home-office , the company or the employee ? 
   certain that europe will choose the path to democracy that 's unthinkable , europe has been , is and will be a dictatorship . 
  i know and i hope it does not come to that . 
  i do n't advocate simply paying up , but letting the icj decide . 
  poland 's case seems to be pretty [ weak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reparations_for_world_war_ii#poland ) though and if i understand the 2 +4 treaty right , russia has no rights to claim reparations either . 
   leave the ez and stay in the eu if possible . 
  it is [ not ] ( http://www.blog.rielcano.org/en/global-spectator-greece-cant-leave-the-euro-without-leaving-the-eu/ ) . 
   syriza has `` red lines '' that the previous puppet governments did not have well , the bailout treaties were signed by the former government . 
  if syriza can not agree to them , they should do without the last installment of the 2011 package . 
  that 's way too positive . 
  - german investment as % of gdp is in the basement and it has been [ declining ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-investment-as-percent-of-gdp-imf-data.png?s=%2fgermany%2finvestment-as-percent-of-gdp-imf-data.html&amp;lbl=0&amp;d1=19800101&amp;d2=20151231 ) for ages . 
  - we have more or less stopped procreating . 
  we are importing young skilled people from everywhere so their home countries bear the burden of education and we reap the benefits . 
  perversely , the number of dinks makes it harder for a family to find a decent flat or house to rent or have two working parents ( dinks are much more flexible in the workplce ) , so the incentive is not to have children . 
  - our wages are [ unremarkable ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) compared with the economic boom we are experiencing - we are exporting capital [ like there 's no tomorrow ] ( http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifohome/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilungen-archiv/2015/q1/press_20150202_kapitalexport.html ) . 
  that 's nice for companies , but it also points to the weak investment opportunities at home and the relatively low wages . 
  - we are much too reliant on building cars . 
  we missed the boat on web , mobile and biotech . 
  also this total economic blitz endangers the euro zone . 
  but of course it is hard to stop if you are on a roll . 
  who cares if they wear ties ? 
  if anything , the crisis was caused by people wearing them . 
  ca n't blame them over the reparations issue either - it would be better for both greece and germany if the issue was decided in court once and for all . 
  if we owe then , we should pay . 
  if not , they should lay the issue to rest , simple as that . 
  also , even though i am no fan of syriza , i do n't think forcing a country out of the eu is the right thing . 
  the ez should throw them a lifeline and continue pushing for institutional reform so that greece has a chance to arrive at good governmental standards . 
  after all , syriza will not rule forever . 
  so what ? 
  it is pretty clear that mh17 did not just fall from the sky but was shot down . 
  whoever did it would have used a weapon with cyrillic markings . 
  i do n't think even russia has claimed it was downed by a nato plane . 
  rich and saturated countries where all vital problems have been solved , so people forget where this all came from and become complacent and lazy . 
  best example is switzerland , one of the most superstitious countries i know . 
  it 's a shame , really . 
  because we 're getting older , just like finland . 
  we have missed the boat on every future tech like web , mobile or biotech and the us and china are the future . 
  i fear this is going to be the future of all of europe . 
  what has sch\u00e4uble got to do with scandinavia ? 
  and while i do agree with you to a point , i do n't really see what tanks got to do with your incredibly divisive society or partisan politics . 
  30 days off plus public holidays , 
   poland : we really do n't need a border to russia . 
  out . 
  i guess that 's pretty reassuring for poland ...  switzerland : boring . 
  out . 
  but we 'd marry rich !, 
  the article claims american spirit and sacrifices . 
  sounds a bit like russia stronk to me , though, 
  here 's the original source : http://theaviationist.com/2015/03/05/us-aircraft-carrier-sunk-by-subs/ - and it 's some weeks old, 
  til , that 's pretty impressive . 
  too late . 
  you know which time it is , right ? 
  private ownership . 
  states are probably the source of evil as in every libertarians mind . 
  i know it 's insane , but it 's actually a thing in some `` progressive circles '' - that minorities can not be racist , only the native population can . 
  no one can kick them out of the euro . 
  if they want to play tough , they can stick around for quite some time . 
  would n't the status as a market economy entail free capital flow and fair and equal investment opportunities ? 
  i am sure german companies would be stoked to buy up some chinese competitors . 
  eat dirt , adolf !, 
  it does , that 's the point of ppp . 
  that 's what they want you to believe . 
  you get the oil , they get sweet liberty by tank , that 's how it works . 
  well , he got 1440 $ back , so about 440 $ interest . 
  still not bad . 
  got to buy me a 12 '' dong in ukraine then ... 
   not starting wars in nearby countries would be the only effective first step . 
  true , but then the middle east and good parts of africa are entirely capable of starting their own wars day in , day out . 
  and it 's not just wars - a lot of young males come here to make enough money to send back home so that their family can survive - understandable , but also based on illusions about the opportunities in europe . 
  i 'd rather not have that . 
  the selection would be subjective and i do n't want this here to become a pro-eu/anti-russian circlejerk . 
  `` filter russia , ukraine , nato '' should reduce the amount of trash links considerably . 
   however , it does not receive financial aid in order to build necessary infrastructure that 's not entirely true . 
  the [ external borders funds ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/migration-asylum-borders/external-borders-fund/index_en.htm ) dispersed over 1.8 bn eur over the period 2007 -- 13 among the border states . 
  [ frontext ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex ) helps with training and organisational backup . 
  but still , border countries got the worse deal , that much is true . 
  i have no idea what to do with unskilled illegal young male refugees , they 'll create trouble wherever they go . 
  same in switzerland i 'd say . 
  once had a business meeting with a pretty high-ranking banker and after the introductory small talk he told me that they do n't have much of a problem with foreigners , only with the `` muslim element '' alluding to refugees from the yugoslav war . 
  landlord in rorschach warned me some restaurants and streets because of them having a high rate of bosnians . 
  acquaintances of me casually talking about the coming `` ausschaffung '' ( deportation ) of muslims because they were most all up to no good . 
  and so on - really left a strange taste in my mouth after some time there . 
  i can kind of understand the rampant xenophobia there ( e.g. 
  against germans ) , but the deeply-ingrained hatred against muslims seems to exist across all layers of society . 
  bit scary . 
  he insinuates you are lying . 
  seems i can not make myself understood , but yes i recognize gypsies can move to germany directly . 
  schengen does come in when we are talking about criminal gangs roaming the whole of the schengen area without any borders to keep them in one country . 
  so both the eu-2 extension and schengen are reasons to worry about a huge surge of gypsies and what they are going to do once they arrive here . 
  both treaties in common are a huge cause for concern . 
  example : gypsy family relocates to country a , does mass burglaries in country b and moves the contraband to country c to sell at flea markets . 
  police just shrugs their shoulders . 
  that 's only because of schengen . 
  i certainly would , but you do n't care : /, 
  sure , we had the same idea [ over here ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9956892.ece/binary/original/24-pegida-afp-getty.jpg ) . 
  caused a bit of a ruckus and is not exactly considered mainstream .
