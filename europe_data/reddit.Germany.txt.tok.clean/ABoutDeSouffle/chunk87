  eu has always taken their time to implement the necessary steps , but in the end has mostly been successful . 
  considering the pure economic might of the eurozone , they can delay that for a decade or more . 
  it 's not really fair , but politics has looked at the ecb to do what is necessary to save the eur . 
  and the ecb has done what was needed . 
   this will be contrary to the eu treaties , but they will have no option . 
  has been done in cyprus , so it can be done again  all contractual monetary obligations governed by greek law currently denominated as euro to be redenominated as new drachma except for the part of greek loans issued under eg . 
  british law in london . 
  i have no idea if greece has issued obligations under foreign law , but i have the nagging suspicion that they have . 
  if they did , this will totally blow up - they ca n't unilaterally redenominate them , so they will have to default on them . 
  ask argentine how that went for them . 
  also : this will kill the banking system in greece . 
  their external obligations will remain in eur , the domestic loans they handed out will be redenominated and depreciate with the new currency . 
  hum , i am no expert , but would the greek state not `` own '' the amount of euros circulating in greece ? 
  and if they introduce a new currency out of thin air * and * still keep their euros ( i.e. 
  not exchanging 10 new drachma for 1 eur or something like that ) they would be fucking their citizens royally because they 'd dilute the money in circulation . 
  or so i 'd say . 
  i have no idea if that is accurate , though . 
  well , had they written that in english , i might have even read it . 
  be proud of your language , culture and country , but do understand one thing : if you want to be heard by people outside your country , say it in english . 
  otherwise , you 'll be preaching to one of 50 medium-sized countries worldwide . 
   i do n't think anyone would want the eu to have only english the main language i do . 
  it would make things so much easier . 
  bloommberg , huh ? 
  is this one of the famous baths ? 
  is it really deflation if one sector not responsible for a lot of jobs ( in this case energy prices ) absolutely craters ? 
  what is this i do n't even ... 
  i can see how this would be very satisfying out of a sense of justice . 
  having to write off all the target ii money would really hurt us , and schadenfreude might be a german word , but the sentiment is shared . 
  but in reality , it would spell the end of the eur - first , germany is the largest economy , so its exit would shrink the eur zone considerably . 
  second , after germany , the other northern countries would most likely follow suit - i doubt they would want to be forced into a monetary union where the currency is perpetually devaluated . 
  third , a gexit would send a huge message that germany believes the eur is doomed . 
  talk about a self-fulfilling prophesy . 
  15 years is a long time , i somehow doubt the west will keep up the pressure for so long . 
  and realistically , if the oil price recovers , russia will have a lot disposable money to buy tech in asia . 
  qe is essentially the stimulus program for greece evil germany is denying . 
  and of course there is nothing like qe in europe ... 
   if hitler used it in his propaganda no , it was part of the successful attempt of communists to destroy the moderate left . 
  of course , all it did was pave the way for hitler . 
  ok , you might not know this , but the phrase predates hartz4 for some years . 
  it was the rallying call of the extreme left because the spd voted for war credits in ww i. 
  but yeah , let 's just mindlessly repeat it because it 's so beautifully hurtful . 
  staying the winter in la gomera and work from remote would be my personal dream . 
  not again !, 
  hey i know this from asterix !, 
  it 's not my personal shit list . 
  on my personal list , i got you guys filed under `` impossible shirts '', 
  - https://indexexpurgatorius.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/die-mullkinder-von-neukolln/ - http://www.pi-news.net/2014/01/tuerkischer-gemuesehaendler-zigeuner-klauen-nur/ not my cup of tea , but easy to find in 10s googling, 
  in about 2003 , there was the idea of a joined french/german citizenship . 
  to make it easier for hitler ? 
  there 's a difference between knowing something and being able to prove it . 
  and there can be different grades of proof . 
  this shoot-down triggered the most massive worsening in western/russian relationships in about 20 years and was the reason for the sanctions , so in the end the proof better be good . 
  personally , i see overwhelming likelihood that the seps with some russian soldiers killed the plane , but i still want to see the facts spelled out . 
  not that it changes a lot for the poor souls who were in the wrong plane at the wrong time , but maybe it helps some of their relatives . 
  what about the kurds ? 
   there is a sub-group who span both the left and the right who blame the elites for using immigration as a tool to keep the working man down yeah , we got them too , they call themselves pegida over here . 
  cheeky !, 
  well , france and germany have a history of war against each other which ultimately ended with the big catastrophe of ww ii . 
  this has been pretty formative for the generation of my parents and is still unforgotten . 
  our political leaders also do a lot to keep the importance of good relations in people 's memory - be it by doing negotiations together ( ukraine ) , be it that both parliaments held a [ joint session ] ( https://www.thetrumpet.com/article/1318.26621.50.0/world/government/germany-france-closer?preview ) in versailles , the french president speaking [ instead of the kanzler for germany ] ( http://www.dw.de/chirac-to-speak-for-germany-at-eu-summit/a-998157 ) on the grassroots level , we have lots and lots of sister cities between germany and france - this might not be extremely important , but it helps if people get to see the other country as children . 
  and of course , german tourism in france is huge . 
   europe should have a common investment plan so that more countries do what germany actually does -- invest in r&d and vocational training , construct a strategic public investment bank , invest in science-industry fraunhofer institutes , envision a green transformation of all sectors through their ` energiewende ' policy , and redistribute wealth between its regions -- not what it says it does ( tighten its belt ) . 
  germany 's infrastructure investments are [ dangerously low ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/german-road-railway-infrastructure-is-decaying-with-harsh-economic-consequences/2013/12/30/2eda2bdc-68ab-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2_story.html ) and of course we have done some belt tightening over the last years . 
  to achieve success with r&d investments , you need a at least moderately investor-friendly climate , strong institutions and good governmental practices . 
  germany is by far not the leader here , but we are doing ok . 
  the switch to renewables has a 30-year history over here , and i doubt it is a major growth driver ( pv panels are made in china after all ) . 
  the author has her ideas in the wrong order : first you need a business-friendly system where you can create startups easily , have fertile ground of foreign direct investments and then you can build those r&d institutions . 
  without it , great ideas are never transformed into companies . 
  hard to generalize , it depends very much on the subgroup you 'd be polling . 
  - eu : overregulation - `` the elite '' ( politicians , industrial leaders ) : keeping the small guy down and keeping all the money for themselves . 
  incompetent , greedy , corrupt - big industrial companies : eco-damage , worldwide exploitation - southern european countries : siphoning off moniez - usa : worldwide imperialism - muslim immigrants : crime , especially violent youth , jihad in our streets , the coming alemanija caliphate - gypsies : stealing , dirtying up the streets - feminists : that i ca n't get sex , declining birth ratio , death of romance - unemployed , esp long-term unemployed : high taxes , high social security deductions on wages - globalization : everything from above - jews : the usual . 
  - ww ii : * ahem * that guy, 
  no , stop it , they do n't need more freedoms !, 
  - 81 % of germans believe france is our most important partner . 
  - polled germans believe the importance of the french/german relationship is about 7.8 / 10 ( over 60 % voted 8 to 10 , i.e. 
  very high ) http://www.stiftung-genshagen.de/fileadmin/dateien/programm_bilder/genshagener_forum_2013/umfrage_mittelmeer_bericht.pdf ( link in german ), 
  one thing to note : i believe , merkel is less rigid than she seems . 
  in the past , she has sacrificed a lot of domestic political holy cows the moment she saw them as a burden ( nuclear power , the old-fashioned family role model her party has championed over 50 years ) . 
  however , she is a populist in the not-so-bad meaning of the word . 
  she acts or reacts when she sees public opinion in favor of acting and sandbags if she believes acting would go against voter will . 
  in the case of the eur , she has staved off anti-european sentiment for years and only lately with the right-wing populist afd did something like that emerge . 
  she will therefore not act decisively in favor of greece if tsipras et al. 
  continue with their creative ambiguity and half-assed reforms . 
  it would not be rewarded by german voters . 
  otoh , peace with russia is important to germans , therefore she is willing to lose some face on the international stage by negotiating a truce as a last-ditch effort . 
  and good relations with france are dear to german voters , so she will help france . 
  what will be interesting is what happens should le pen become president ... 
  uh , they have great bike lanes and bike rental stations there . 
  it also helps copenhagen is a small city .

  this . 
  in germany , any kind of renewables are subsidized , but small-scale wind turbines make no sense - you need the high masts . 
  small-scale solar works . 
  in germany , our population density is 226/km2 , in the us it 's 34.2 / km2 - that 's a big difference that also influences how pupils get to their nearest school . 
  for a lot of them , bikes are a perfect solution . 
  in rural areas and smaller towns , we have [ school buses ] ( http://www.bus-bild.de/1024/diesen-man-mit-dem-kennzeichen-69015.jpg ) , they are just not that ubiquitous and iconic . 
  no problem , our humor is infamous . 
   i just do n't support your foreign politics to a large degree so do i , but credit where credit is due : the us reserved the really bad shenanigans for third-world countries while helping european countries a lot . 
  and without them , nato would be a joke .
