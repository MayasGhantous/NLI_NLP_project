  this is going to be great for every woman who so decides to have herself pierced , only to be treated as a victim against her will with every hospital admission . 
  then what are those `` some communities '' the spokeswoman is talking about ? 
  when i visited new york , i definitely did not find people more friendly or talkative , i heard quite a lot of `` no '' . 
  but in our company , there is this tendency . 
  i can understand why we would come over as rude , whereas i 'd really wish our american colleagues would stop waffling . 
  second fastest would spoil the impact of the headline ... 
   the cultural difference is big my grandmother was taught in school that france was our eternal enemy . 
  nowadays we are best buddies - and even some years of le pen will not change that . 
  that is a cultural change we have to thank the eu for . 
   germany and france show no signs that they are willing to leave their own languages to install english as the norm language . 
  i dunno , but a lot of signs and public broadcasts ( e.g. 
  in trains ) are bilingual in germany . 
  this was not the case when i was younger , it has been a development of the last 20 years . 
   but then , germany introduced a toll system for non-german drivers who use german roads . 
  this is hotly contested . 
  on the one side , german drivers pay a tax , so they pay upfront for using the roads . 
  on the other side , there was a pretty fierce debate if this toll system is legal in the eu framework . 
  and do n't forget the eu abolished loads of national legislation . 
   there is n't even an european army , we 're relying on the nato . 
  eu does not have to do everything , nato is just fine . 
   disservice to the image of germany than the op itself i am pretty sure , germany can live with that . 
  so can i btw . 
  can your sect live with the filth they spread ? 
  but cps in the states creates one scandal after the other , did n't you know ? 
  it 's pretty orwellian , our jugendamt is * tame * in comparison . 
   should be dealt with class , neutrality well , op and you obviously share an agenda from fundamentalist christians or scientology and are completely lacking class or neutrality . 
   if it was easy for me to prove or disprove anything and learn legalese german in a blink , i would n't be here taking this kind of pointless jab shenanigans , you have a secret agenda and came here as the `` innocent bystander '', 
   i 'm actually shocked germany has this system in place as a civilized country . 
  whoa it does not work exactly like in the us , what an outrage !, 
  i 'd disagree , as far as i remember , a cypriot exodus from eur was very much on the table and the ecb practically held a shotgun to cyprus ' head . 
  i 'd say it 's a clue that 78 % believe roma are more criminal and warrant extra police action . 
  they are pretty much universally loathed in germany . 
  while there is no institutionalized discrimination i am aware of ( quite the contrary , the state is trying to integrate them via housing offers and streetworkers ) , - 30 % do n't want a gypsi as neighbors , 50 % want the state to restrict roma immigration - 80 % want the social services to fight social benefits abuse by roma , 78 % the police to fight criminal roma , 20 % want them deported and 14 % want * ahem * segregated housing - it is the minority that has the least sympathies and 50 % believe they deserve the prejudice . 
  - otoh , 81 % are aware of prosecution of roma by the nazis , so people are not completely unaware about the historical roots of their prejudices . 
  ( http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/sinti-roma-antiziganismus-100.html - source in german ), 
  i predicted capital controls about three weeks ago and they will be coming , there is just no other way than to pull a cyprus light . 
  what is this ? 
  a scientology/free homeschool/evangelist meetup ? 
   i was a bit astonished to receive these results , '' admitted volker beck , one of the mp 's . 
  `` the feeling in the jewish community , as well as my feeling , was that there were more muslim antisemitic attacks , but the statistics does n't support that gee , what ** a ** suprise . 
  maybe , just maybe those stats are fudged ? 
  i guess every swastika on a wall is lumped in with some youth beating up a jew instead of setting up different categories . 
  but i am not surprised that a pro-migration , antifa center would come to this conclusion . 
  obviously , we neither have a free press nor any oversight over our legal entities . 
  i have linked the relevant laws above , but i can not find a translation and i sure as hell are not going to translate them . 
  also https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ze9xb/warning_for_people_with_kids_thinking_of_moving/cpi5cm7, 
  you looking for human rights in germany ? 
  you come to the wrong place , buddy !, 
  i believe you can find the same critical articles about social services all over the civilized world . 
  they have to decide in hairy situations and often have to decided against one partner ( in domestic violence cases ) or one parent ( in cases of child abduction ) . 
  i know there are quite some cases where people have fought long and bitter lawsuits with the jugendamt , but again i would be surprised if the situation was different elsewhere . 
  of course i would n't claim that german social services were immaculate - they would err in some cases . 
  i am not going to investigate this any further , because op 's submission as well as the linked document is so full of blanket statements , bullshit , and misrepresented facts that i know it would take hours to disentangle truth from hyperbole from outright lies . 
  your link is pretty specific about home-schooling which is not legal in germany . 
  you want to home-school , you have to move abroad . 
  if you do n't and your kids do n't visit a school , the jugendamt will intervene and after some talking and court decisions take your kids away , that 's true - but it is firmly based on german laws . 
  i guess he is just butthurt because he could not abduct his mixed-national kids as he saw fit . 
  i know , but op is pretty obviously trying to push an agenda here - i am sure i read the same stuff some time back , but ca n't find it . 
   i dont know why the autor picked it up made it up to have a nice story . 
   germany has an institution called jugendamt which literally has the power to take away your children i guess that 's true for about any country ? 
   and put them into protective custody without right of appeal or explanation ( ?! ) . 
  haha as if . 
   they do n't have to offer any reason for doing this , they can not be overruled by other instances of the german judiciary , they do n't need to follow european humans rights agreements what a load of hogwash . 
  if the jugendamt determines there 's immediate danger to the child , they can take away the child - as a last resort . 
  usually , they have to coordinate with the family court and have to talk to the parents first to find solutions . 
  and seriously , does anyone believe some institution is above human rights agreements ? 
  except for the nsa , maybe . 
  relevant links : - https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/inobhutnahme - http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_8/__8a.html - http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1666a.html - http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1666.html this `` trennungsv\u00e4ter '' - submission sounds extremely fishy . 
  probably we are talking about bi-national families here where one of the parents decides to move back to africa and take the kids with them , while the other partner does not want to move . 
  in that case , the family court will be called and to prevent an abduction , the jugendamt might take the kids . 
  * audiatur et altera pars * - this is completely missing from op 's link . 
   the elder is mature , self-assured , and judicious in action . 
  hum , well ... 
  a bit down the page , see `` left parties open to reparations '' . 
  german source : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/reparationen-politiker-wollen-griechenland-entschaedigen-a-1023797.html left-wing politicians from spd and green party start calling for a repayment of the infamous zero-interest loan and the creation of a trust funds for the victims of the german occupation . 
  since this seems to crop up every two weeks or so , there are [ options ] ( http://imgur.com/8ey0szi ) . 
  i 'd say it 's more involved . 
  we do n't have a lot of military objectives besides helping out nato - we do n't project our power into 3rd world countries like france or the uk , because we did n't have such a long and important colonial phase . 
  we do n't need to defend the fatherland like countries from china to israel do - all our neighbors are nice enough people . 
  we do n't have a border dispute or wrestle for supremacy like greece and turkey . 
  well , we have a border dispute with the netherlands , but no one cares . 
  we ca n't have nukes and i am not sure why we want them - the ` murricans hopefully have our back if russia has funny ideas . 
  and france and the uk would at least put up a determined face and voice deep concerns if the russian army was moving in our general direction . 
  so , a lot of voters see no point in having a huge army . 
  also 350 tornado fighters and 170 f-4 . 
  i do n't see how this qualifies as not militarized . 
  will be over here on monday , lets hope they find a common ground . 
  and i sincerely hope he does not underestimate her - lots of male german politicians did so over the years and regretted it afterwards . 
  it has been described in the scrolls of the elders ... http://imgur.com/lrrqzgl, 
   there are many corollaries to godwin 's law , some considered more canonical ( by being adopted by godwin himself ) [ 3 ] than others . 
  [ 1 ] for example , there is a tradition in many newsgroups and other internet discussion forums that once such a comparison is made , ** the thread is finished and whoever mentioned the nazis has automatically lost ** whatever debate was in progress . 
  [ 8 ] ** this principle is itself frequently referred to as godwin 's law . 
  ** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law, 
  the mostly used version `` whoever plays the nazi card automatically loses '' does , it means you ran out of arguments or got so emotional that your only means left was hyperbole . 
  hum , germany had 2000 leopard-1 and as many leopard-2 tanks back in the cold war times . 
  who the hell cares . 
  it 's quite likely he did it to demonstrate how greece should have shown germany the finger , but seriously , the guy was no minister back then . 
  it is most unfortunate that people outside the net never seem to understand godwin 's law . 
   without going extreme no small state can hope to have a relevant army . 
  still does not explain what germany does .
