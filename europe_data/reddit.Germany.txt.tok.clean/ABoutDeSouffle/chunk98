  exactly . 
  the root cause is * not * austerity , but low productivity coupled with wage growth ( http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/fromaug2011/peetersfig1.gif ) . 
  this of course reduces competitiveness , both against others in the eurozone as well as internationally with the relative stability of the euro . 
  ideally , the eurozone would have very similar unit labor growth across member countries , with the south and east having slower wage growth than the north until their productivity is comparable . 
  in reality it was nearly the opposite in the south . 
  [ well worth a read ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/wages-and-productivity-eurozone ) [ this article ] ( http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/01/18/1344272/all-pain-and-no-productivity-gains/ ) , although critical of austerity , deals with the same issue in more depths . 
  it is pretty easy to spot the difference between ireland and greece in the way the societies responded to the crisis . 
  so yeah , while m\u00fcnchau wants the eurozone to simply throw money at the crisis to paper over the problems in the hope they 'll go away , it 's deeper issues would remain unsolved : the wage/price level of greece was unsustainable with the extremely modest productivity increases they had . 
   while you play this game of extend-and-pretend , the real economy implodes : austerity has caused a meltdown in income and employment . 
  `` it 's not the speed that kills , it 's the sudden impact '' . 
  yeah right , confusing cause and trigger again , wolfgang ? 
  i am not sure if you even read the part about good government practices ... 
   not helping the old `` no nazi 's fighting for ukraine '' argument there bud or russian false-flag ops . 
  i read that different ( emphasis mine ) : `` the first russian incursion into ** irish-controlled airspace ** was 88km off the coast . 
  the second was much near , just 19km ** outside ** our sovereign airspace and the incursion lasted from 3pm to 7pm . '', 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airspace ) : `` by international law , the notion of a country 's sovereign airspace corresponds with the maritime definition of territorial waters as being 12 nautical miles ( 22.2 km ) out from a nation 's coastline . 
  airspace not within any country 's territorial limit is considered international , analogous to the `` high seas '' in maritime law . 
  however , a country may , by international agreement , assume responsibility for controlling parts of international airspace , such as those over the oceans '' seems to me the first incident was 66km outside ireland 's sovereign airspace ( = 88km off coast ) , the second 22km outside ( = 44km off coast ) . 
  i believe ireland has set up an airspace control zone that stretches beyond its sovereign airspace and the russians flew only into this control zone . 
   jet fighters can follow them on sight and transmit their position , force them away from busy traffic lanes if needed . 
  i do n't think you are right on both cases . 
  first , they get picked up by surveillance radar early ( all russian planes , esp . 
  those tu-95 have ** huge ** radar silhouettes ) , so the typhoons pretty much do only visual id . 
  second , in international airspace , you can not simply force them away from their route . 
  whereas central/eastern europe will become the object of an empire . 
   in the future , an eu army might one day exist out of a necessity . 
  seriously , the eu is not another usa . 
  if things go a little bad , then come june 24 ^ th , there will be no uk in the eu . 
  an army speaking ~ 15 languages will not do great in any battle . 
  there 's extreme reluctance to put soldiers under the command of another country . 
   we 're already heading towards a french-british army . 
  no way . 
  just you wait for june 23 ^ rd, 
  considering some in the afd would literally shoot children to keep refugees out , it 's not totally clear how different they would be to some radical arabs . 
  that 's pretty rude . 
  bull . 
  there has never ever been a group of refugees that completely went back . 
  the fuckers should just open the true texts to the public instead of spewing fud . 
  if greenpeace doctored the papers , bad for them . 
  but without the official texts , we 'll never know, 
  reduced vat for hotel stays . 
   however , that 's only because germany , in the long run , is in equal measure to its net exports to the us a net importer from other countries actually no ( unfortunately ) . 
  germany has had a nearly uninterrupted [ positive balance of trade for the last 50 years ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/balance-of-trade ) . 
  that 's against all other countries . 
  this of course is balanced , but in such a way that germany also is a net exporter of capital - that is , it invests ( or wastes ) as much as its trade surplus . 
  over the last couple of years , german companies and investors have lost a mind-boggling 500bn of investments abroad . 
  everyone would be better off if we had higher wages to rein in the trade surplus . 
  i guess it is telling that - the top legal firms specializing in isds are located in the usa - lots of tribunals are held in the usa - [ the usa never lost a isds case ] ( https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/fact-sheets/2015/march/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds ) :  the evidence is equally clear in the united states . 
  despite having 50 isds agreements in place , the united states has never lost a case ) i have a hard time believing this system is less rigged than a hearing at the hague court - just in the opposite direction . 
  and i do n't see why it would be impossible to ensure that in each court hearing , the judges are from different countries than the subjects of the settlement hearing . 
  at least in the us , judges decide about life and death , there should be a way to conduct fair trials in the scope of a free-trade agreement . 
   isds itself are not that bad if implemented correctly . 
  that is just not true . 
  there is no way isds can be implemented without violating basic democratic principles . 
  and because there are only a couple of highly specialized legal firms doing large-scale isds , it lends itself to cronyism and corruption . 
  not trusting the legal system of a country you take to court ? 
  that 's a valid concern and therefore , investor/state disputes should go to a international public court . 
  headline is taking the citation out of context :  our study shows that professional qualifications is the most important factor in enabling humanitarian immigration to contribute to public finances . 
  it is even more important than the speed of the integration process . 
  it is crucial that people are sufficiently qualified , meaning that they have achieved the qualification level of the local population . 
  the right issues are already being discussed . 
  the important thing is quick and massive intervention . 
  1 . it 's a study about the economic consequences of refugee immigration , not an advisory of any kind 2 . 
  the translation would be better if it read `` it is crucial that people get sufficiently qualified '' what she says is basically `` if germany wants to have net financial gain , then it needs to act fast and offer qualification to bring people up to domestic levels '' . 
  sure , i do n't doubt that - just based on his poll data , the us likes nato a bit less than 50 % . 
  taking this out of proportion ... 
  i ca n't see a realistic scenario where the us would withdraw from nato . 
  if germany did n't want ramstein , we could have told them to take a hike since 1991 - that 's when we regained full sovereignty . 
   and you dont want bigger economy in a free trade zone why would n't we ? 
  our trade balance with the usa is [ very one-sided ] ( https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4280.html ) - we export twice as much as we import . 
  and guess what : - the primary sector ( which encompasses agriculture ) makes up only 0.9 % of gdp - secondary ( industry ... ) : 29 % - tertiary ( services ) : 69 % so , the cheap us food exports are no real threat to our economy . 
  getting easier access to the huge us market for industrial products , cars , and machinery opens up * huge * chances . 
  that 's why merkel is a staunch ttip supporter and even the left-center spd supports it grudgingly . 
  france and poland are way more hit by free-trading of agrarian goods . 
  what is true is that the german population is largely against ttip , on account of the opaque negotiations , fear of gmo imports and general aversion to change . 
  so , basically the usa does n't want nato . 
  germany does . 
  just to clue you in : the majority here wants nato to stay . 
  that 's why we have things like [ ramstein air base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramstein_air_base ) . 
  and we * are * the biggest economy in the eu , the us does n't endanger this . 
  you are wrong , china returned the air frame . 
  well , the german constitution has a social dimension tacked on to property rights , so limiting the profits landlords can realize to protect poorer citizens is not only permissible here but true too often forgotten core values here . 
   if we had a serious threat near alaska and europeans were stationed there , he would not be complaining . 
  i can see where you ( or obama ) are coming from , but i 'd just like to point out that nato art . 
  5 has been invoked exactly once :  five nato planes have arrived at tinker air force base in oklahoma city , oklahoma , officials said friday , the first-ever deployment of non-u.s. aircraft for military missions in american airspace . 
   the airborne warning and control system aircraft , or awacs , will supplement similar u.s. aircraft patrolling the skies over the united states  along with 74 u.s. nato personnel , crew members from 11 other countries -- including 55 from germany , 22 from canada , 11 from belgium and 11 from italy -- have been deployed to the united states . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.edition.cnn.com/2001/us/10/12/ret.nato.awacs/index.html ) so , there . 
  you got a crisis , we are there . 
  i did n't know that . 
  when i visited , the canary islands seemed like a bit poorer , but nowhere like nearly 30 % unemployment . 
  i guess the agriculture died with cheap mass transport of foodstuff too ... 
  core inflation ( excluding energy , food , alcohol & tobacco ) is at 0.7 % - still too low , but you can see the influence of the low energy prices . 
  it depends . 
  in principle , movement of people from regions with high unemployment to those with high demand of workers is a good thing - this kind of mobility is very high in the usa and it works very well for them . 
  it can be good for the less well-off regions too because they have less people claiming unemployment benefits . 
  the downside is that typically the young and better educated move to better regions , which creates a demographic time bomb ( just ask latvia ), 
   canarias ( es ) 29.1 damn , why is that ? 
  i can understand estremadura , but canarias ? 
  the place is bustling with tourists . 
  my boss still tells people asking for a promotion `` ca n't do that , if you do n't like that , you need to look elsewhere '' .
