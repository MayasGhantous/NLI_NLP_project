  we are an it department , of all things . 
  sadly , i think the majority or nearly a majority in germany wants to abolish the sanctions and come to better terms with russia even if it means throwing ukraine under the bus . 
  let 's hope , the afd never gains influence on federal politics . 
  if your country borders the potential enemy , you become the battlefield if things go wrong . 
  it was n't a fun time , growing up in germany in the 1980 's and knowing about the plans both sides had to defend germany to the last german . 
   the european project will eventually become a federal one currently , that 's the least of our worries , i fear . 
   . have these things not happened , are migrants model new citizens ? 
  there we go again . 
  what a straw-man . 
  look , if you can not argue without hyperbole , blatant generalizations , lack of sources or any interest in acknowledging there are more shades than black and white , i am outta here . 
  careful , man . 
  once the eussr officials read this , you 'll just vanish ... you have come too close to the truth , they ca n't let you live !, 
   ** the migrants ** [ ... ] have no intention of doing so themselves by breaking immigration laws , sexual assaults and benefits fraud that 's a prime example of a blatantly unfair generalization . 
   when the european army walks in your streets to calm the violence it created maybe then you will understand ( this will happen ) . 
  lol , there is no european army , and there is not going to be one . 
  you sound like the americans harping on about the new world order , the bilderberger group and black helicopters abducting people . 
  i ca n't imagine that this is a serious red line for russia . 
  how would they argument they have the right to forbid an independent and neutral country to join nato ? 
  i believe he is just bluffing to try to deter sweden - which in the end will make it more likely the country will join nato . 
  i 'd say those with the most legit concerns are the baltics and finland/sweden . 
  russia would have to march through ukraine and/or belarus to get to poland , romania or any of the other former warsaw pact states ** in numbers ** . 
  i ca n't see a successful invasion starting in kaliningrad or across the black sea . 
  now , blitzkrieg was very successful in ww ii , but would it work across such distances against nato ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  but the baltics are in fact in a geographical position that makes them undefensible with conventional means against a blitz - small , with a large border to russia and no big land border to nato ( the one towards poland in precariously close to poland ) . 
  uh , western europe does n't care ? 
  then why are there sanctions in place ? 
  why did we have meeting after meeting where politicians went to great length to get putin back to reason ? 
  the truth is , nobody really knows how to rein in putin and how to manage russian aggression . 
  no one wants to be the next chamberlain , but otoh everyone with a sane mind knows that outright military aggression against russia does n't lead anywhere . 
  so what remains ? 
  start building up weapons programs so expensive that russia ruins trying to keep pace ? 
  worked with the ussr , but i guess no one wants to try that just to see russia breaking up in a civil war . 
  not with all the nukes and modern weaponry there . 
  it 's easy to be snobby , but what are the real alternatives ? 
  fud tactics : `` you know , you are free to do as you please , but do consider there are * consequences * to you actions , which at this point shall not be spelled out '' . 
  every powerful country does that to an extend , lavrov is just extremely bad at it . 
  in all fairness , while i can see some truth , i think this would go against the grain of russian politics since ages ago . 
  both the ussr and russia have tried to have a corridor of neutral or friendly ( or occupied ) countries between themselves and nato . 
  they 'd have to prove they had revenues and if they were self-employed for a day , it would be clear they tried to cheat, 
  actually that is a huge problem over here . 
  both for the spd which gets gutted in elections because merkel occupied a lot of their traditional positions and for the whole established political system . 
  outside of bavaria , none of the established parties is home for that part of the population that is susceptible for right-wing politics . 
  traditionally , the cdu was the party that integrated the right-wingers , but with merkel 's policy change , that 's no longer true . 
  while i agree with her policy , i can see this is a problem that will greatly help the afd . 
  yes , it is basically an anti-romanian law . 
  lots of romanians ( and to an extend , people from bulgaria ) have moved here just to claim benefits . 
  they either live here in run-down building blocks or only have a address or live in their home country and get a phone call from the landlord if they have to present themselves to authorities . 
  in the grand scheme of things , the damage is n't that high , but it 's tabloid fodder and with the emergence of our right-wing populists , established politicians want to put a stopper on it . 
  refugees get much lower benefits from the beginning , if that 's what you mean . 
  if you are married , you 'll get joblessness benefits for one year and after that , your partner has to support you . 
  it was hotly contested and the proposed law only applies to people who have n't worked in germany and basically come for social security . 
  once you have income and later get fired , you are entitled to the same benefits as germans . 
  i think the uk and france have their own awacs , and there are shared nato awacs planes stationed in germany : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_e-3_sentry#current_operators but in principle , you are right, 
  and how many of those experiments were only possible on a manned space station ? 
  the hubble space telescope was much more expensive [ because it had to be launched on the shuttle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hubble_space_telescope ) :  the challenger accident brought the u.s. space program to a halt , grounding the space shuttle fleet and forcing the launch of hubble to be postponed for several years . 
  the telescope had to be kept in a clean room , powered up and purged with nitrogen , until a launch could be rescheduled . 
  this costly situation ( about $ 6 million per month ) pushed the overall costs of the project even higher . 
  the whole shuttle concept was completely flawed . 
  instead of deriving a rocket for heavy loads from the atlas or saturn rockets , they build a manned system that made every flight incredibly expensive . 
  and guess what , the successor to hubble [ is going to ride an unmanned rocket ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_webb_space_telescope ) to space . 
  if we had invested the money we burned on the service jobs to hubble in technology to use robots for jobs like that , we 'd now have the means to service satellites without human intervention . 
  things like the photo of the [ pillars of creation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pillars_of_creation ) , news about earth-like planets , the rosetta/philae mission absolutely did create excitement . 
  and they cost a fraction of what apollo did . 
  manned space travel is just a huge waste of money at our technological stage . 
  we did spend money on things like the iss which obviously is part of developing the technology for long-term stays of humans on the moon . 
  if we absolutely have to build toys then the money should come out of the iss budget , but not the science budget . 
  the us is just doing the [ same dumb shit ] ( http://www.planetary.org/blogs/casey-dreier/2016/0425-the-senate-just-proposed-to-slash-planetary-science-funding.html ) and it will hurt their planetary robot probes so they can fund the sls . 
   why should we spend money on discovering earth likes if we can not even settle the closest celestial object . 
  because we have the technology for the former , but not the latter . 
  and because we should not use money for scientific research for something that is not scientific . 
  which we wo n't . 
  so it 's either burning money on a moon village * or * actual science . 
  for all intents and purposes it is the german constitution , just by another name . 
  those tensions haven been raging here for the last 12 months or so ? 
  we do have a constitution , it just has a different name . 
   every war has been started over interference in independence . 
  i do n't think that 's true at all . 
  damn no . 
  let 's not burn the small budget of esa for moon villages . 
  manned space exploration is such a freaking expensive way to burn money . 
  why ca n't we build a handful of telescopes on the moon first and link them up to create a huge [ synthetic aperture telescope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aperture_synthesis ) ? 
  we should be able to discover earth-like planets , make close-up photos of aliens picking their nose etc. 
  i am not sure that 's true . 
  idk . 
  it 's gotten a bit better lately , but for the last year or so , this sub was straight in line with / r/worldnews . 
  meh , the unemployment rate is actually up 0.5 % year over year . 
  uh , ah , volkswagen has a monopoly on cars ? 
  and how does french industrial policy compare to google 's mobile os ? 
  the author could have mentioned the role of the eu in [ breaking the roaming charges cartel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_roaming_regulations ) if he wanted something at least similar to a monopoly but i guess that did n't fit the agenda . 
  mentioning that the eu has a host of [ anti-trust regulations ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/overview_en.html ) not just to go after us companies would have been the honest thing . 
  the author could have mentioned there are not many eu companies operating monopolies like facebook or google do and microsoft did . 
   in the last decade , there have been very few major anti-trust cases against european companies . 
  if someone cares for facts , there 's an [ eu antitrust case database ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/cases/cases.html ) readily available . 
  how would that change ? 
  if nato can not guarantee security there , no one can . 
  russia is not suicidal , invading a nato country is not a thing they will do . 
  what kind of special treatment would that be ? 
  i 've yet to hear any major german politician say they want britain out . 
  should you elect to stay , there will be a slight grumble because britain managed to get some special deals , but i ca n't see a lot of hard feelings .
