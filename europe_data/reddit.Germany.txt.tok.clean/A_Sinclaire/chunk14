  i guess those are either anarchists who just want to destroy stuff ... or youths who say think that owning a car is part of being member of the bourgeoisie . 
  at least until they are old enough and at some point maybe need a car themselves . 
  that would be my assumption at least . 
  but they are idiots either way . 
  here they are just regular cars for the most part except for the really high end models ... but for those people it does not really matter . 
  eh . . depends on the cars . 
  some leftists also like burning mercedes / bmw / audis etc because capitalism and rich people . 
   i read that a lot of these protesters will be antifa and troublemkers . 
  i guess a better way would be to say that there will be a lot of protesters and a lot of antifa/troublemakers . 
  but in terms of percentage the latter probably only make up a small amount of the total number . 
  while i do not know any numbers i can say that you would be wrong . 
  us presidential candidates who do not even make it to the election are for the most part treated as unimportant and forgotten as soon as the real election campaigns begin , especially if they did not hold an important office before . 
  a logistics company specialized in transporting frozen food for supermarkets etc. 
  he was making a joke because `` nm '' could mean nanometers instead of nautical miles . 
  while what you say might very well be true , i assume it is not the big fishery crews that protest against the eu but primarily the small boat fishermen , or at least i have the impression that they are the driving force . 
  and their quota was set by the uk government . 
  as you say their quota is half of their capacity . 
  i mean i certainly would also complain if i could earn twice as much ... but are not allowed to . 
  [ article from 2011 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/05/fishing-quotas-privatised ) :  [ ... ]  as fish stocks have dwindled , and under the catch limits imposed by the eu common fisheries policy , these rights to fish have become increasingly valuable and can now be leased to fishermen for substantial amounts of money . 
   given this , it is somewhat shocking that very few members of the british public know that the british government freely gave these fishing rights to a small section of the fishing industry in 1999 . 
  these public goods have , since then , been bought , sold and leased for private profit on an unofficial , non-transparent and loosely regulated quota market . 
   [ ... ]  the vast majority of uk fishing rights were given to a small minority of large vessels . 
  smaller fishing boats ( under 10 metres in length ) , which make up around 75 % of the uk fishing fleet , were only granted about 4 % of fishing rights . 
  this means that thousands of british fishermen have been left with very little right to fish , although smaller boats provide more employment and are widely considered to be more environmentally friendly , they have been forced to either take on the considerable expense of leasing quota from the owners of fishing rights , or go out of business . 
   [ ... ]  the identity of these quota owners and traders is shrouded in mystery , as the management of quota fishing rights is not in the public domain . 
  only the producer organisations ( the industry membership associations that manage quota ) know exactly who now owns fishing rights . 
  the government has admitted that even they do not know who owns the quota . 
  see . . liechtenstein is for small corporations and tax avoidance . 
  major difference . 
  not really , there are multiple parties in the parliament - but all of them are loyal to lukashenko . 
  there are also opposition parties as well . . but they never get any seats or boycott the elections outright . 
  it might be a win for schulz , but not for the spd as a whole . 
  so the effect for them probably will be minimal . 
  in the end the spd were the party who allowed the cdu/csu to write into their coalition agreement that gay marriage was off the table . 
  it was the spd who , against their own believes , pushed that topic aside in order to stay in power . 
  if they had more of a backbone this could have happened many years ago already . 
  and therefore very gorgeous !, 
  imagine a longer walk from point a to point b ( say 300 + meters ) ... and no golf cart for trump . 
  australia as well, 
  it was more like this : `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` if you stop bothering me you can have something similar , okay ? '', 
  `` i guess '' ... a little later ... `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` can we have gay marriage ? '', 
  `` no '' `` so , uh , we do n't have gay marriage '' `` guess not '' `` can we have a vote on it '' `` sure , whatever '' `` ok , then . 
  nice ! '', 
  `` laters '', 
  some probably , yes . 
  but my bet would be that still around 35-40 % of cdu/csu members vote in favour of this . 
  i do n't think that even a parliament with the afd in it would have stopped it , if it would be a free vote like now and not along the party lines . 
  even within merkels cdu a majority is in favor of gay mariage - even if it is a smaller majority than in other parties ( about 60 % ) . 
  probably not that expensive / difficult if you are rather young and fit and have the means to do so . 
  but think about some older folks , maybe not too fit - which probably would make up a bigger portion of those only living off of ubi . 
  maybe barely they 'd also barely have any friends / family etc. . 
  they would have to hire movers to transport the furniture , pack stuff etc. . and that could become expensive . 
  your example of addicts etc spending all the money of course is also a valid convern though . 
  but if you live in an expensive city , then you have no leftover money to move as a move is an expense in itself . 
  and since the ubi would replace state support also for stuff like that , you could get trapped in such a situation . 
  well , she destroys the hopes of dreams of the opposition campaign managers . 
  whenever the opposition has a big topic they build up , merkel makes it her own topic and takes it away from the others so they have nothing left to play with . 
  same thing happened with the nuclear power phase out . 
  ever since then the greens have lost their main talking point . 
  it depends on the details . 
  but increasing ubi per child , would be the same as kindergeld ( if the amount stays the same ) - so removing that would not be an issue . 
  it would just reduce the paperwork . 
  on the basic level hartz iv would be replaced by the ubi - which should have some advantages . 
  currently if you receive hartz iv you are pretty much treated like dirt . 
  baf\u00f6g is the student loan ... getting ubi instead sounds good as well to me . 
  nothing to pay back afterwards . 
  the main issue i see is the wohngeld - basically the social state paying the rent . 
  this can vary so wildly between rural areas and cities , and run down parts of a city and an average part of a city ( not even a high end one ) that a flat rate for this aspect seems to be a major issue . 
  in a city like munich you might get a tiny room and a box of rice for that money . 
  somewhere rural in eastern germany you could get a big apartment and live decently . 
  more like seeing the other kids building a nice sand castle on the beach and then running full speed and detroying it with one kick and walking on without even looking back . 
   they have a bunch of other similar stores ( newegg for instance ) in the us that the eu just does not have . 
  there are plenty of comparable stores . 
  they are just not as big / known . 
  though for example alternate from germany is rather big and already has online stores in 12 european countries . 
  here is their english language uk site : https://www.alternate.co.uk/, 
  while you are right , i think traditionally g20 ( or g-anything ) is pretty much left wing territory when it comes to demonstrations and violence .
