   if there 's anything the germans can do well it 's logistics . 
  eh , as a german i would like to remind you of our rather embarrasing attempts to fly some military instructors to the kurds ... the first transall plane had a layover somewhere and could not start anymore due to technical difficulties . 
  they sent a spare plane . . and that stranded there as well - also due to technical issues . 
  the third plane finally managed to get them there with quite a bit of delay . 
  someone else probably knows more about this ... but i think it is because the ruler of the holy roman empire was crowned by the pope unlike the original roman empire and the east roman empire . 
  the linked article states that this was kind of a preliminary announcement . 
  the car dealer offered an out of court compromise ( taking back the car for current market value ) and the court said that if the compromise would not come through they would announce a decision 14 days later . 
  today is 14 days later and the court only today made it official . 
  btw the current update says the driver was a known drug dealer and police now suspect an attack from the organized crime scene . 
  from my reply to another poster below :  now i am by no means an expert ... but an lpg tank would be in the trunk of a passat i think . 
  the trunk on that car is still in tact , while the drivers door is bent outwards and the roof in the front is bent upwards which leads me to the assumption that the explosion occured near the drivers seat . 
  but again this is just armchair guessing on my part , 
  i could be wrong of course . 
  but the pic is what leads me to this suspicion in the first place  now i am by no means an expert ... but an lpg tank would be in the trunk of a passat i think . 
  the trunk on that car is still in tact , while the drivers door is bent outwards and the roof in the front is bent upwards which leads me to the assumption that the explosion occured near the drivers seat . 
  no because the police says so [ official twitter from the police in berlin ] ( https://twitter.com/polizeiberlin/status/709672906226311168 ) and you do know that bombs are used to assasinate people right ? 
  this would not be the first time . 
  half a year ago in hamburg there was a similar attack on the leader of the mongols mc with a pipe bomb attached to the bottom of his car for example . 
  eh it was a small bomb . 
  not the vbied type bomb to blow up a market place but more like the type of bomb to blow up the driver of that car . 
  for that reason i 'd suspect something like a gang or family clan taking out a rival . 
  it 's been a while and i do not remember the name , but romeo and juliet was not that original but as far as i remember just a rewriting of an old english poem or something along those lines . 
  after looking it up , the main source was * the tragicall historye of romeus and iuliet * by arthur brooke . 
  well but anyone could blur an address in germany ... even people living in a backyard appartment not even visible on the images just because they shared the same address which was just stupid . 
  and the owners of the houses could n't do anything against this . 
  and this also meant that the house owners lost money because , if you were looking for a new home / appartment on streetview and it was blurred this either meant the house was in a shitty condition or at least one of the neighbors was hypersensitive - which drove prices down ( some even tried to sue because of this ) because many people do not appreciate this type of neighbor . 
  and i would argue they provide a service in return for this data ( which as mentioned above often enough is not even `` your '' data ) which is more useful to you as an indivdual than your individual data is useful to them . 
  so i 'd say at least in this case you would profit more than google would profit from you alone . 
  street view is quite useful ... and i am annoyed that i have to make do with only a few cities and images almost a decade old . 
  got a new client at work ? 
  look up their company address and see if they really are as big as they say . 
  want to drive somewhere in a different city ? 
  you can look up good parking spots in advance . 
  but with street view germany that company location might now have been expanded to a multi story complex while on the images we have here there only is a small shed ... and that parking lot ? 
  it 's a park now . 
  it 's bullshit . . and just because of a small minority that is scared of modern technology or they think everything revolves around them and google or anyone using google wants to spy specifically on them because their life is oh so interesting . 
  yeah i exaggerated somewhat ... but is underarmed for it 's size and usually you would find destroyers in that size class . 
  the last german destroyer , decomissioned in 2003 was 4700 tons , the f125 is 7200 tons  then again even our other frigates are already bigger than that . 
  as for the land attack options ... originally it was planned to have a 155mm gun and mlrs ... both got scrapped . 
  so it kind of lost half its weapons for that purpose ( though i read the 127mm gun is as good with the right ammunition ) as for the jss . . 
  i think the plan was to acquire both f125 and jss ... but for the latter they lacked funds let 's see what they get out of the new mks180 which is supposed to be at least 4 ships that can do everything :d, 
  some have brown water navies - for rivers & lakes . 
  serbia have one mine layer and 4 mine countermeasure vessels on the danube river i think . 
  austria had a navy until 2006 consiting of two patrol boats . 
  also on the danube river . 
  bolivia not only has a navy , but also naval aviation and a marine corps for its lakes and rivers . 
  the upcoming german f125 class will probably be in a similar situation as the holland class . 
  the size of a destroyer , officially called a frigate ( destroyers are evil ) , armed like a patrol boat . 
  some people call it a modern colonial cruiser - which kind of describes its role quite well , 
  actually the german foreign ministry even pays for full page newspaper ads and tv spots in certain countries that try to discourage people ( though i think most of those campaigns so far were done in the balkans ) . 
  it 's not even a purely scandinavian thing . 
  it 's just one of many short forms of the name, 
  but those polls are made to be representative ... that is why those people get paid to select an meaningful sample of people . 
  i 'd hope that this is true for all questions of that survey . 
  some certainly . . for many this would be the end of the road for quite some time though because - besides the dangers - getting to western europe is not cheap and many will have sold everything they had for their first attempt . 
  in the german thread it was mentioned that the route is operated by meridian ( both trains belong to them ) who in turn belong to transdev gmbh who are the german subsidiary of transdev from france, 
  yeah . 
  though as mentioned it is quite unlikely it was them . 
  it seems the group of people that does this is located in berlin . 
  just a week ago on feb 1 they planted an incendiary device at a cable housing 30km outside berlin on an ice highspeed railway track . . though it failed to ignite and police found it quickly due to someone claiming responsibility on a left wing website . 
  not that i think that this is the case here . . but if this would have been caused intentionally , then it would have been by left-wing extremists almost certainly . 
  in recent times they did set fire to railway switches quite frequently . 
  though those types of attacks mostly occur around berlin - so it 's highly unlikely that this was the case here . 
  afaik spearmen made up a big part of germanic fighters at that time while romans used mostly swords and bows already . 
  so for the germans it would have been a regular word to describe their soldiers ( though according to wikipedia the term was also used to describe young males and the arm holding a spear ) while the romans then might have just used the term for all germans and not just those specic soldiers . 
  at least i could imagine that . 
  in a similar fashion the franks ( now french ) were named after the proto-germanic * frankon * it seems - which was their local name for the spear . 
  afaik `` german '' also still has a rather unknown origin - caesar just called a group of people in the north germani , but i think there is no real evidence of a single tribe of that name besides that . 
  though germans had a spear called the `` ger '' so germani would be spearmen ( at least i think that is like an obvious link . . but none of the etymology dictionaries seems to mention it ) . 
  germany had a spelling reform some years ago as well ... while officially the new spelling is correct for many people at least in non-official / non-formal use it 's still all over the place when they did not learn it from a young age . 
  also some stuff is just stupid . 
  a good example : * schifffahrt * ... that is a triple consonant . 
  we did not have this before the reforms ... and it just looks strange . 
  yeah she might get a bit more . . but i doubt it will be close to what she wants . 
  well germany is really good at badly spending military budget :d i think i found some polish numbers for 2016 ** total budget : ** germany $ 34b - $ 8b poland ** running cost ( personal , food , repairs , electricity , bases ) : ** $ 20.4 b - $ 3.5 b ** pensions : ** $ 5.7 b - $ 1.6 b ** research : ** $ 0.7 b - $ 0.2 b ** equipment ( ger ) - modernization ( pl ) ** $ 4.6 b - $ 2.2 b however in 2015 the budgets for this were much closer as poland spent an additional 1.1 b on jets last year while germany spent $ 400m less . 
  ( no guarantees that those numbers are all correct and that both contries counted the same way though ), 
  but they can do more with their smaller budget . 
  looking at the german budget we spend 33 % on personal / salaries and another 18 % on rents / upkeep of bases plus 8 % of upkeep / repairs of material ( vehicles , equipment ) . 
  then there are 16 % for pensions * thats 75 % of the budget . 
  and this stuff will be considerably cheaper in poland . 
  only about 18 % of the german defense budget are spent on research , new equipment , new bases etc. 
  i would guess that the number is higher on the polish side . 
  * edit : wrong translation - its pensions and not supplies, 
  that would be the correct translation . 
  though the german title is polizeipr\u00e4sident / police president . 
  we still have this in german associated with some older war related things . 
  streitmacht = war power = army / armed forces ( still rather commonly used ) streitwagen = war carriage = chariot streitkolben = war club = mace streithammer = war hammer streitaxt = war axe the others are still used when talking about history etc. 
  streitross ( war horse ) is one i have not really heard used in even that context anymore though . 
  if not a university degree then you need an apprenticeship for many jobs in germany . 
  this means 3 years of combined practical and theoretical training tailored to that specific job . 
  now germany has a lack of apprentices for many jobs as more and more people go to university . . but for 2014 that still was `` only '' 37000 open apprenticeship position . 
  this is miniscule compared to the number of refugees . 
   the relative disadvantages of the electric car become practically irrelevant on short distances . 
  if you mostly drive short distances it is likely you live in a city . 
  if you live in a city it again is rather likely that you have an apartment and not a house with its own garage . 
  if you do not have your own garage there is basically nothing in place right now to allow over night recharging . 
  depends - if that person posseses hundreds of pamphlets in order to hand them out or for example does propaganda videos for online distribution this would be support of a terrorist organisation - at least in germany . 
  a question that comes to my mind . 
  we know there was a bomb threat earlier today against the hotel of the german football team . 
  could this have been a test by the terrorists to see the response times ?
