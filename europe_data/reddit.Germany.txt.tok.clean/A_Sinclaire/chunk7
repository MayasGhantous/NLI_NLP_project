  you are just not allowed to intentionally use it against people - though i do n't really know where that line is drawn . 
  i guess it can get a bit murky . 
  by the way - it seeems that this guy might not be who people think he is - that s an afghan refugee . 
  - the is video calls him by a different name than what he stated to officials in germany - police found pakistani documents in his room - a tv channel had his is video analyzed by an expert who says his way of talking pashto is clearly of the pakistani and not the afghan variety . 
  so it might actually be someone planted among the refugees from the beginning - or just a migrant who took an afghan identity to increase his chances of getting asylum . 
  untrue - erdogan is giving interviews on tv so he can not be in a plane trying to land in germany . 
  oh they certainly are . 
  my hometown duisburg ( which is in the west - but also has some pretty run down places ) tore down 170 houses in recent years and replaced them with parks . 
  there were some protests because some of the buildings were old and nice once and could have been renovated - if anyone would have invested in them ... but no one did . 
  they were dirty ruins and very low income housing . 
  if you have one or two run down houses in an average neighborhood you likely will find someone to rebuild them . 
  if you have a whole neighborhood or village like that no one is interested . 
  in case of east germany they probably could demolish the worst places first and leave the `` potentially valuable '' ones for as long as possible though . 
  that would be the decision to be made . 
  there is no lack of ability - just a lack of will . 
  for areas like that we should think more about renaturalisation . 
  just demolish the empty parts of the city and turn them into parks or whatever . 
  that is better than having lots of ruins there . 
  but the un itself needs a reform first - you barely can do anything because one of the permanent members will always veto something . 
  the solution would be to enlage the permament security council to 8-9 members , remove the veto power and instead use a 2/3 or 3/4 majority . 
  but good luck with getting any one of those to give up their veto . 
  but as long as this does not happen the un will stay pretty much useless . 
  and the lcs shows that even the us ca n't always get this done - the us could have pooled its resources but decided `` well , fuck it - lets build two different ships just because we ca n't decide '' :d, 
  all of our debates are also televised by a semi-dedicated channel ( when no debates are on they usually show political talkshows or documentaries ) and also put on youtube . . but barely anyone watches - most debates on youtube have a few hundred views . 
  he currently is in pre-trial custody , still waiting on the trial to begin . 
  the crash was in february and the arrest warrant is from mid april - so all that is still rather fresh . 
  i guess they kind of have to - everyone who needs to know that they have nukes already knows it anyway . 
  but they receive a lot of money from the us for military purchases for example - if israel is an official nuclear power then the us ( or the us public ) might say that this provides sufficient protection and so there could be pressure to cut those funds . 
  the last part could be possible . 
  look at the mlpd - the marxist leninist party of germany - they are tiny with 1800 members , but as far as i know per captita they are one of the richest parties in germany . 
  this is in part due to them owning several properties , but also due to people just giving them all their money ( or a large chunk of it ) once they discover that hardcore communism is what they want,

  uk joins us new us moves capital to london us now is regarded as a european country us become member of the eu,

  the german `` marines '' are under the command of the dutch forces . 
  the biggest dutch navy ship is under shared dutch-german control . 
  dutch paratroopers are under the command of german forces . 
  though with the way things are going i would not be surprised to see dutch subs getting integrated into this polish-german sub unit next . 
  i just looked into the numbers out of curiosity . 
  the uk has [ lots of tabloids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_newspapers_in_the_united_kingdom_by_circulation#2010_to_present ) with a rather high circulation . 
  germany pretty much has bild - that 's it when it comes to nationwide tabloids of the same `` quality '' . 
  and in the last ~ 18 years bild lost about 57 % of its readers and dropped down to a circulation of ~ 1.9 m. 
  the express which i would consider one of the other bigger tabloids of the same sort , but more regional , only has a circulation of ~ 120k which is tiny ( and they lost 68 % of their readers in the last 18 years ) . 
  i 'd say in germany `` proper '' daily newspapers are still quite popular and mostly of the regional variety . 
  bild is a slowly dying exception . 
  if the government would manage to represent 80-90 % of the people to a satisfactory level it probably would be the most beloved government ever . 
  eh , if you do n't like the euro then complain to the french . 
  they were the ones who pressured germany into a sped up introduction in 1989 in return for accepting the german reunification . 
  france actually complained that germany slowed down the plans for a common currency and integrated economy . 
   i do n't know anyone who thinks we can keep freedom of movement without giving it up . 
  i probably saw at least a dozen people here on reddit write stuff like that . 
  and then there are all those people who say the eu needs the uk more than the uk needs them and that the eu will be in a much worse negotiation position and will be unable to exert pressure on the uk because the uk now is in a position of power ... 
  i may get this wrong , but it often has been written that the spanish government would be against scotlad joining . 
  but would n't the scottish seccession strengthen their position since it would not be unilateral but approved by the uk government . 
  this would also establish that the spanish government would have the final say in their own case . 
  i guess it is a big plus for tourist destinations . 
  and scotland certainly is one as well . 
  i mean that would be the ideal - from a non-uk perspective . 
  but this is not going to happen . 
  the uk always was the entitled diva amongst the eu states - and i do n't think this is going to change any time soon . 
  so my hope is that with the uk gone , that the eu maybe could be run a bit more efficiently , although that might not be too likely as it still is a colossal bureaucracy . 
  but the lack of the uk money maybe could trigger some necessary slimming process - like finally make up your mind and choose strasbourg or brussels and stop wasting money by being present in both . 
  and maybe at some point the uk will want to join again - and then the eu leaders should have the spine to say our way or no way . 
  no more special treatment . 
  i actually think at least a certain amount of them is just `` professional contrarians '' - they do n't care about the issue but they earn their money with fighting against the status quo . 
  some of them might as well have lead a `` join '' campaign ( sorry , i mean `` broin '' campaign ) had the uk never been in the eu - just because . 
   but the other option is that we negotiate our own bi lateral trade agreements with countries . 
  eu countries are not allowed to do their own trade agreements - that 's what the single market is for . 
  so the uk can not do individual trade negotiations with the majority of their main export partners . 
  you are now of course free to do so with the us , china , switzerland and russia etc, 
  german trade within the eurozone is balanced though - so there is no big surplus here . 
  the trade surplus comes from non-eurozone eu countries and non-eu countries . 
  but you do know that we had the dm , like 16 years ago and the german economy was doing rather well despite that ? 
  why should the dm now suddenly tank the economy ? 
  another rumored bidder was amazon - which would have been interesting i think . 
  basically vws - but cheaper . 
  some new gadgets might be used in the vw earlier , but with the skoda version you save thousands in turn . 
  many people here opt for a skoda superb instead of a vw passat for example . 
  especially since the superb offers more room inside . 
  well that makes the royal navy about twice as big as the german navy, 
  you say it 's against tesla . . 
  i say it 's against the new audi q7 e-tron . 
  the base price without taxes is $ 67k - and it launched just one month before the new incentive was put in place by the parliament . 
  i think not :p also , most of the money probably will go to toyota and renault . 
  it 's not as if german brands had a lot to offer in this segment . 
  poland and denmark both use the german leopard 2 tank .

  the greens can be divided into too wings - the `` realos '' and the `` fundis '' . 
  the former are almost conservative , with a few exceptions . 
  they were the ones who under foreign minister joschka fischer sent the german army on its first combat missions after ww2 ( serbia , kosovo ) etc. 
  sure there are still core ideas like getting rid of nuclear energy and other environmental policies ... but besides those i 'd say they are moving closer and closer to the political center over time . 
  the latter are the hard left leaning ones . 
  they seem to have lost quite a bit of influence over time . 
  they are not completely gone though . 
  probably this . 
  though especially in the south in recent years a lot of `` bouncer gangs '' have formed that slowly expand north . 
  they are kind of modeled after mcs but do not use bikes at all . 
  they mostly disguise as boxing clubs / martial arts clubs instead . 
  for germany it technically is 81 km/h ( as 31 km/h over the limit in urban areas means losing the license for a month ) but in germany police also deducts a margin of error ( 3kmh below 100 km/h or 3 % above 100 km/h ) .
