  so this means you would lose the license at 84 km/h ( which would show as 81 km/h in the paperwork ), 
  according to diehl , the pzh 2000 achieved a range of 80km with vulcano ammunition . 
  it seems the choice for guided ammunition will be between excalibur and vulcano . 
  in such cases nothing will happen either way . 
  but there are a lot of less dramatic , smaller resolutions that would go through . 
  for example in 2015 russia vetoed a resolution condemning the srebrenica massacre / genocide . 
  or they vetoed a resolution regarding the mh17 investigation . 
  russia and china vetoed investigations into election fraud in zimbabwe and demands to allow opposition and humanitarian aid workers to act freely . 
  the us vetoed a resolution just calling for more diplomatic efforts to reach a peace deal in the middle east and calling for the parties to stick to previous agreements . 
  that is not really realistic in any way . 
  they would not neccessarily lose their seats . 
  but they would be less powerful . 
  exactly - as long as there is a veto right the unsc will never be really effective because for most issues at least one of the parties will have an interest to block the others . 
  it would be far better to increase the unsc size to 7-9 members and use a 3/4 majority vote or so . 
  but the current unsc would veto such a change . 
  unfortunately no specific source . 
  i 've read this quite a few times over the years though . 
   i 'm also sure that they do n't have any kind of relevant spy network in the region . 
  that is actually one of the few things the german intelligence service is supposed to be rather good at ( or not be totally bad at ) . 
  no , we do not have something like that here . 
   everything else is pretty much not fit for human consumption . 
  which is funny to say because most of their `` house-brand '' stuff is just rebadged big brands , sometimes with slightly altered receipts . 
  this has nothing to do with history . 
  germany had one of the biggest western militaries during the cold war and spent well above 2 % . 
  and right now the 2 % target is for 2024 . 
  why though ? 
  if the agreement is 2 % by 2024 then that is it . 
  and as usual when this topic comes up ... 
  i have to mention the 0.7 % of gdp for development funds / foreign aid the us signed up for years ago together with others countries . 
  since then the us actually has reduced their foreign aid to below 0.17 % . 
  i guess they also should provide a plan for that in 2 months , too . 
  / r/germany mostly is for expats living in germany ... with some germans mixed in . 
  maybe originally ? 
  do n't know . 
  but amazon now uses them for all kinds of goods, 
  but germany has almost balanced trades within the euro-zone , some surplus within wider europe and the majority of the surplus outside of europe . 
   amazon already handles payment in all cases , i guess it would n't be far-fetched for them to also handle vat accounting . 
  they do n't unfortunately . 
  and they specifically tell sellers they have to take care about the vat registrations themselves . 
  if you use amazon fulfillment service right now they do not even provide means to automatically include invoices . 
  quite possible . 
  amazon now has warehouses in the czech rep. and poland . . but they are effectively warehouses for the german market . 
  likely because shipping across those borders does not add cost for amazon ... but lower wages etc save costs . 
  it would make sense though to also use those warehouses for the local markets as well , as local forwarders might be able to offer even lower shipping cost there . 
  but not every seller will be present at those warehouses as you need local vat registrations in both countries which is a cost factor for smaller sellers ( and amazon only allows to opt in for both countries , or pay an extra fee if you do n't - you can not select only one of the two countries ), 
  while that might just have the shape of one , modern germany actually was developing a stealth fighter in the 80s . 
  but the us at some point stepped in and `` persuaded '' germany to not continue the development because they wanted to have a monopoly on stealth jets ( though even without us interference the project might have died due to the end of the cold war ) . 
  the plane was the [ mbb lampyridae ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mbb_lampyridae ) , or firefly , of which they already built a manned scale-model . 
  the names written next to the eagle are part of the logo . 
  while searching for something totally unrelated today one of the search results was an / r/conspiracy thread about how car-based attacks by terrorists are done in order to push us towards self-driving cars . 
  o ,0 that 's mental gymnastics 2.0, 
  no just one guy . 
  after the car crashed the driver ran to the parliament and started stabbing . 
  the thing is you can not just staret spending money - you first need to know where to invest it ... without wasting money . 
  but you can already see some projects getting bigger or added that were not planned a few years ago : + an additional 100 tanks + 5 c-130 planes for special operations forces + 5 additional k130 corvettes + 2 additional submarines + 6 instead of `` 4 +2 as option '' mk180 frigates + 5 new tanker planes to replace the current ones, 
   germany is n't permitted to own [ ... ] missile defense . 
  source ? 
  most of the restrictions regarding the german military were part of the weu - and the weu ceased to exist . 
  the sachsen class f124 frigates already are scheduled for updated radars to allow icbm interceptions . 
  and the land based meads system which also is already confirmed to replace the patriot missiles is capable to intercept regional ballistic missiles ( but not icbms ) . 
  same gun on a different truck . 
   because no one has ever done that before ... ** jesus ** . 
  confirmed christian fanatic . 
  the few switching from le pen in the first round to macron in the second are kinda strange . 
  i guess protest voters who want to set a sign but not actually have her as president . 
  afaik germany and france already share intelligence to some extend - especially when it comes to the spy satellites . 
  france has optical spy sats and germany has radar spy sats - so they have different capabilities that complete each other . 
  if we kill off all planets and only leave dwarf planets then pluto will still not be the biggest as eris is bigger . 
  your machines probably went from secure to vulnerable to secure due to obscurity by now . 
  what happened to the sails they tested on tankers that were fixed to the bow like kites ? 
  as far as i remember the tests a few years ago were rather successful showing quite some fuel savings . 
  same for d\u00fcsseldorf really . 
  i live kind of next door in duisburg . . sure d\u00fcsseldorf does have a nightlife and a high end shopping street , and public transport is better ... but would my city be one of the best cities to live in with this stuff ? 
  i 'd say the average , middle of the road areas of both cities are pretty similar . 
  d\u00fcsseldorfs expensive parts are just more expensive while duisburgs run down parts are a bit more run down . 
  but the ordinary citizen likely would not live on either extreme end . 
  it 's a perfect 5/7 . 
  wikipedia says that agricultural products are not part of the andorras customs union agreement , only manufactured goods are . 
  so i guess it would be better to put them only half into the customs union the the custom checks at the borders seem to be due to andorras low taxes - also since they are not members of the schengen area . 
  maybe some of them were turks coming over from germany where the color orange and the fruit orange are both called orange ? 
  not really afaik . 
  but de maiziere was quite outspoken in that we should not allow this while von der leyen was talking about letting them talk to show that freedom of speech is good . 
  merkel likely will look at which statement gets better reactions and then get behind that one , as usual . 
  we had some pretty cheap ones at home . . basically just some thin velcro you put on the frame after cutting it to the right length and then cutting the net to fit and put it on the velcro . 
  as long as the windows open inwards you do n't ned more . 
  now with the windcow shutters being outside it might be an issue though . 
  but i guess you could have a net with an overlapping net over hole which would allow you to reach through to open / close them . 
   the eu should be funded exclusively by a eu-wide 10 % corporation tax . 
  would be quite difficult for germany as there is no federal corporation tax . 
  the corporation taxes are muncipality taxes . 
  and if that would go towards the eu the muncipalities would loose their main tax income . 
  different classes of drones ( hale vs male ) for the male role germany currently leases israeli heron drones . 
  in the future germany will buy heron tp drones which can also be armed . 
  that got me kind of courious how todays navy compares to the one of 1989 and the one we 'll have in a few years . 
  ** surface combatants ** 1989 : 7 destroyers , 7 frigates , 40 facs , 5 sub hunters now : 10 frigates , 5 corvettes near future : 17 frigates , 10 corvettes ** subs ** 1989 : 24 subs now : 6 subs near future : 8 subs, 
  peugeot and opel already use the same platforms for some vehicles ( family vans , delivery vans primarily ) , they also already planned to use the same platforms for suvs and crossovers . 
  in 2013 they did plan to also use the same platform for compact cars , but those plans were cancelled . 
  there are rumours that psa wants to make opel an all-electric brand . 
  i mean what better brand could there be for this than opel with their lightning bolt logo ? 
  there were thousands of one star ratings for that armenian genocide movie on imdb ( before it was released ) - i guess the same folks who can one star that movie on imdb can also give 10 stars to the erdogan movie .
