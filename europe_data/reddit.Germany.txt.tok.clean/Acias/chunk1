bakkav\u00f6r seems to be based in the uk and not iceland . 
  you can have a research about the amount of times or the amount of people that got violated or both . 
  then again you are only being held captive for one long time while the other person might get raped on a daily basis , i do n't think you can compare that in this case . 
  well , i think i am technically conencted to at least a 50mbps network but i am paying for a 16mbps one , but getting somewhere around 12mbps . 
  that would be enough but the upload is pretty slow , not enough to stream with a good quality . 
  they could give us the money instead so we could use it to build refugee homes . 
  i really do n't believe that you can get 71 living people into that truck , they surely must have been dead before that . 
  the situation where they came from must be really bad that they choose to og such distance . 
  [ iceland also have great musicians . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxnw5ddyey ), 
  they are doing this a lot . 
  turning old cartoons into 3d animated ones . 
  i personally am not a fan of it but i guess if you 're young you do n't care about it and are used to cartoons being in 3d . 
  [ germany once had a brown bear crossing the border into bavaria . 
  that bear did n't last long . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bear_jj1 ) [ but as long as you 're a white bear everyone will adore you . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knut_%28polar_bear%29 ), 
  after thinking a little about it i would consider portugal , spain , france , benelux , great britain , ireland and iceland west europe . 
  germany , italy , austria , switzerland and the other smaller nations within middle europe . 
  denmark , finland , sweden and norway northern europe or scandinavia + finland . 
  rest would be considered east europe . 
  that is from my viewpoint from where i live . 
  basicly everything east of my home is east . 
  but i do n't think we really need to set a country to a specific region in europe . 
  poland is often considered as part of middle europe and i do n't see anything wrong about it . 
  i returned somewhere around 7 euros worth of plastic bottles today . 
  always makes me feel real shitty going into a discounter with so many empty bottles . 
  last time i voted i threw mine into a bin too , but that 's usually always the case . 
  they make for great storage units . 
  do n't know if that 's a good idea . 
  they found no bomb , if anyone cares . 
  30 $ 16k down ( 12 really ) and 1k up , in munich . 
  as the killer is only 13 years old he 's not old enough to get jail time , that 's all i can get out of it for now . 
  also 4 others injured , some of the classmates . 
  he/she had also a knife and an air gun/rifle . 
  i 'm watching starcraft 2 wcs finals , alone . 
  what i read is that they do n't know who was on that flight because you do n't need an id to be on that flight . 
  has nothing to do with the pilots . 
  but yeah it seems that they kinda want to know who is on the plane and if they are a danger to the flight . 
  [ our tram .

  if you watch normal german tv you 'll find ads for similar services to netflix way more than ads for netflix . 
  netflix came much later that other services , but i actually do n't know which of them have the bigger library . 
  also in most cases you 'll only be able to watch it in german and very rarely you can select the original/english version . 
  sausage and potato salad . 
  i do n't know why but my mother does this . 
  i do wash and soap them after being on public toilets but not at home , also i try to open the restroom door not with my hands but with my arm instead . 
  uhm , i read that somewhere on reddit once and it made sense to me . 
  people sometimes say sauce instead of source because if you search for source you get every comment , at least with res that is . 
  that 's why some adopted the word sauce instead , so you can search for it and get to the right comment . 
  pirate party for csm . 
  ever asked one of them ? 
  maybe some do , maybe others would like to work but are not allowed to . 
  never forget bruno . 
  part of it being too cold could be because they are used to a much warmer climate . 
  after reading / u/blablahfish 's translation their problems seems more reasonable than the headline implies . 
  it 's not an ideal situation and we can only hope that it get 's better for everyone involved . 
  bikes everywhere . 
  not pictured are the thousands of icelandic spaceships . 
  [ link to german wiki ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/leichtathletik ) . 
  athletes as in field and track athletes , so yes . 
  in german we have a distinguished term for those , do n't know about english , probably what you said . 
  when my fathrr and me visited the vatican soon after the euro coin came he hoped to get vatican euro as change , but all he got was italian coins . 
  we had to learn the script by heart for one of our english classes and then perform parts of it in front of the class . 
  he was n't even arrested . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/4go6o3/im_the_guy_who_trained_his_girlfriends_dog_to_be/ well he got arrested , released and no charges . 
  i 'm not talking about small insults against each others . 
  i 'm talking about death threats and other similar writing . 
  again , i do n't know what those people exactly got arrested for and i would agree that it 's bollocks if they get arrested for a slightly heated sonversation . 
  no , i 'm basing it on the german version . 
  you are allowed to say what you want but there are limits to it . 
  if you go around and say certain things in public you can be sure that police will come and stop you . 
  again , i do n't know what tweets those londoner posted , it heavily depends on what they said . 
  if it 's small stuff like saying that you think that some things are stupid , i agree that would be total overreaction . 
  without knowing for exactly those peopel said , no one should judge it . 
  people here cry about freedom of speech , but freedom of speech only goes so far or at least they need to deal with the consequences . 
  it really depends on what has been said . 
  nothing in norther germany and denmark , hmm . 
  https://www.deutsche-sammlermuenzen.de/shop/5-euro-sammlermuenzen/5-euro-sammlermuenze-planet-erde.html this seems to be the official site to buy it online . 
  they had 2 version , one with higher production value that did cost 15,55 $ but they 're out of stock . 
  the other version costs 5 $ but i ca n't find any information on when it will be available . 
  one site says 10th june . 
  http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/content/de/standardartikel/service/sammlermuenzen/2016-sammlermuenze-planet-erde.html here they say you can buy it at credits institutes and at the bundesbank for 5 $ , should already be available . 
  except that one time where we sung about a bit of peace . 
  rip germany . 
  at least we got 1 point so far . 
  yeah i 'm really thinking about getting one . 
  usually not someone who collects stuff but that blue border is really nice , also the other side looks cool too . 
  they got the german flag wrong , so triggered right now . 
  but seriously , that happens quite often . 
  time for a rare event , waving little german flags without feeling bad . 
  eu is just gon na ignore what 's going on in turkey until it 's too late . 
  probably every capitol city . 
  maybe if they vote to leave the uk they can leave it at the same time uk leaves the eu and thus still be in the eu . 
  might be better to know that the uk will be without them . 
  do n't worry my brother , it 's just a social experiment !, 
  they are retreating to the north , that 's what 's happening . 
  great song to whistle on a cementary/graveyard . 
  * holds up spork *, 
  i thought about / r/de vs / r/germany,
