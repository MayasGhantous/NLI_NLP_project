  please tell me again how the muslims are a problem because of their intolerance , guy who wants to bring back the nuremberg laws . 
   these are the same people who fail to realise that the last major war in europe was against far-right fascism , most of whom express views similar to those that were fought against . 
  * at best * they 're people who fail to realize that . 
  that guy in particular knows exactly what he 's doing . 
   bit of a difference between those things and killing people for being gay , or criminalizing leaving the religion . 
  yes . 
  for example , the things i listed are legal in germany , actually happening right now , and are openly advocated for by what is the majority religion in some states . 
  but i 'm sure your focusing exclusively on the most extremist fundamentalists of an already marginalized and powerless minority religion is because you 're just really concerned about gay rights . 
   i do n't understand why westerners equate christianity and islam . 
  you understand the reason these muslims are coming to your countries is because of islamic violence in the countries they are fleeing , right ? 
  i do n't understand why all the right-wing ignoramuses pretend that this is something inherent to islam and could never happen with christianity , even though it has . 
  [ * even though it does . 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uganda_anti-homosexuality_act,_2014 ), 
  no one ever said that the borders were closed . 
  no one ever said that germany would stop accepting asylum seekers . 
  you think it 's a show because you 've been missing the point of the border controls from the beginning . 
  i blame the circlejerk on reddit that makes people think that closing the border and rejecting all refugees is an opinion with majority appeal . 
  he probably thinks that if we get more muslims in germany , then we 'd suddenly find ourselves with a major religion that does n't allow women to hold influental positions within its organizations , refuses to employ gay people and advocates against gay rights . 
  you know , as opposed to what we have now . 
   ps i like how quickly you abandoned the `` hurr durr muh civil war ! '', 
  line when confronted that syrians are the vast minority of migrants . 
  lol , gg with that agenda . 
  syrians are also the group that germany said the thing about that people like you chose to misconstrue as an `` invitation '' , so gg with merging your lies into a consistent statement . 
   since germany said they were welcome it 's germany 's responsibility . 
  let 's shorten this , wo n't we ? 
  now i say that germany never said that , then you tell me some shit `` but that 's how it was understood '' , then i say `` how is that germany 's problem '' and you say `` they should have known that people would misinterpret it '' , and everything will be germany 's fault anyway because that 's what you have decided , so that 's how it has to be . 
   for a stampede that germany caused since you obviously missed it : there 's a civil war in syria . 
   no that does n't sound right . 
  this article is about a german domestic politician setting eu policy by decree . 
  you ca n't compare that to us politics . 
  you can only not compare it if you deliberately lie about it , like pretending that some german dude with no authority whatsoever was in any position to set anything by decree . 
  sigmar gabriel ca n't decree anything in germany , you 'd have to be borderline retarded to think that he could order the european union around . 
  they would n't be similar if northern europe also discounted an arbitrary amount of poor people from their statistics . 
  do n't give me that crap . 
  what just happened is that you 're moving the goalpost . 
  you claimed `` german law ** has ** the notstandsgesetz '' , and after i mocked you for that you looked it up and realized that it has no applicability whatsoever to what we 're talking about , so now you 've moved the goalpost and say that `` germany could ** make another ** notstandsgesetz '' with the majority of the current government . 
  for which i 'll only mock you more because you ( 1 ) do n't know * anything * about german politics if you think the two thirds majority of the governing coalition means anything in this matter and ( 2 ) failed to take into account that there 's parts of the german constitution that ca n't be changed . 
   you 're twisting what i said you literally said `` everything he said has merit '' . 
  lies and more lies ... 
  you think that is what i said ? 
  i guess while you 're at it you might as well double down and defend the lie with another lie . 
   even german law has the notstandsgesetz . 
  if things get ugly , a lot of things will change . 
  i guess it would be pretty empty in here if everyone just shut the fuck up when they do n't know what they 're talking about . 
  what kind of question is that ? 
  we just are n't . 
  there are no specifics to not doing things . 
   kind of back fired for them when they used to lecture all the eastern eu countries on their roma treatment . 
  now france tries to deport them in violation of eu law . 
  the irony . 
  `` now '' . 
  i see you keep on top of events . 
  you think it has merit to say that we 're bringing all the refugees to europe ? 
   it is interesting that it is always propaganda when it comes from the right and facts when it is coming from the left . 
  it 's interesting that you think i say it 's propaganda that we 're `` bringing these people here '' because it comes from the right , and not because it 's an indisputable fact that the refugees come here all by themselves . 
  projecting much ? 
   in my opinion anders breivik needs to be in jail for the rest of his life . 
  not for vengeance but for the sake of simple common sense , any man willing to gun down 69 kids can not be trusted as a member of society . 
  that 's where you misstepped in constructing your scenario . 
   you better have a good answer why you think you can overrule future norwegian experts from your armchair on another continent twenty years earlier . 
  your scenario explicitly includes experts talking directly to the man and having observed twenty years of development , that say you 're wrong . 
  on what basis do you , twenty years earlier , having never met the man , having no experience and no education in the field , contradict them based on `` common sense '' . 
  you have explicitly chosen to construct a scenario where someone with vastly more experience than you and vastly more knowledge than you says that you are wrong to showcase how i 'm being naive because i 'd rather listen to that man and not you . 
  the sheer arrogance is mind-boggling . 
  under those circumstances ? 
  sure . 
  why not ? 
  ( that 's not rhetorical . 
  you better have a good answer why you think you can overrule future norwegian experts from your armchair on another continent twenty years earlier . ), 
   breivik 's sentence is totally relevant , relevant enough to get you to look up what it is ? 
  you 're derailing . 
  if you honestly thought that discussing breivik 's sentence would add to this discussion , you 'd have bothered looking up what it is . 
   but there 's a difference between recognizing the fundamental problems within my own system . 
  and still thinking that it 's fucking dumb to release a terrorist assassin into the public after 6 years of an apparently ineffective rehabilitation program . 
  that 's because you do n't recognize the fundamental problems within your own system . 
   do you think that anders breivik should be released after he 's served his ten years ? 
  i 'm a cynical guy . 
  you 'd be advised to get your facts straight in the future because when you massively understate a european prison sentence in a discussion about low european prison sentences , i 'm not inclined to assume that it 's an honest mistake . 
  i 've never seen anyone complain about `` their culture and identity getting destroyed '' who had any concept of either of those things . 
  typical responses include `` eating schweinsbraten '' and `` not having muslims living here '' . 
  i wish i was joking . 
   more like what if you had laws that we 're a bit more strict with people planning assassinations of politicians . 
   seriously , eight years ? 
  eight years for plotting to kill a fucking prime minister ? 
   i 'm not sure if this is some sort of failure of your mental health evaluations or just a failure of sheer common sense . 
  but in my eyes this qualifies as pretty , fucking , dumb . 
  look at your crime rates , look at ours , then have fun while your colleagues blame it all on the black people . 
  sorry , on not being `` ethnically homogenous '' . 
  do n't make me pull out the leaf and the clock . 
  here you are , railing against the very idea of human rights and the entire concept of the rule of law , and actually have the audicity to say that it 's the muslims who threaten our values . 
   so in your opinion this terrorist should have equal rights to everyone hm ? 
  it 's not just my opinion . 
   we are not forgetting ourselves we need to uphold the law . 
  ** name the law that was broken . 
  ** if you say that we need to uphold the law as opposed to what we 're doing right now , then prove that these are n't just empty words and are n't just a smokescreen for what is actully a call for arbitariness and ** name the law that was n't upheld ** . 
  i 'm all for upholding the law , but `` upholding the law '' does n't mean arbitrarily locking everyone up because you think they might be a danger or maybe do n't like their face . 
  that 's not the rule of law , that 's just fascism . 
   if we allow people like this man to roam our streets and kill people then human rights will mean nothing because europe will just be syria 2.0 if we do n't accept that everyone has human rights , then human rights will literally mean nothing , because they 'll be gone . 
  do n't style yourself as the protector of rights that you yourself called `` privileges '' not even half an hour ago . 
   or allowing every single refugee to live here indefinitely do you know what makes me paranoid ?
