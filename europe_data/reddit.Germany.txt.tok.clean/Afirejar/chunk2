  additionally , there is no way to enforce a ruling short of war , and no one is going to war with spain over catalonia . 
  second , the icj is a court that arbitrates between states . 
  the only way for catalans to be able to sue in front of the icj on this matter is to get international recognition for their independent nation first , and then sue for not having been recognized when it actually mattered - i.e. 
  only when it would be completely pointless . 
  third , governments ca n't override their nation 's constitution . 
  that 's kind of the point of having one . 
  i doubt `` we ca n't do this , but we can empower someone else to empower us to do this '' is going to fly in the tribunal constitucional , or any other constitutional court . 
  for an example of the power of the icj see nicaragua v. united states , where nicaragua obtained a judgment against the us over the latter 's support of the nicaraguan contra rebels . 
  the us ignored the court 's decision , so the only thing that ever came of it was a un resolution calling for compliance with the judgment , which the us then also ignored . 
  edit : for completeness sake : they could theoretically sue at the european court of justice or the european court of human rights , but it would be pointless because neither eu law nor the european human rights convention recognize a right to secede and form an independent nation . 
  if they did , those courts would have the same issues of enforcement and government-granted unconstitutional powers , but that 's a moot point . 
  germany lowered the requirement to get in from 5 % of the vote to 3 % of the vote . 
  at current poll numbers for the federal elections , this would be enough to get three pirate party candidates in . 
  i 'm definitely looking forward to this . 
  international laws have exactly as much jurisdiction as national governments are giving them . 
  the difference between paypal and bitcoin is , that paypal makes the news when it fails and bitcoin makes the news when it succeeds , and that should tell you everything you need to know when you 're chosing your payment service . 
  not when , if . 
   i know , but it is n't what op was talking about ... 
  if you use paypal as a credit card payment processor , then it is n't different from any other payment processor , and effectively it is a feature of a credit card . 
  yes , it is . 
  op is talking about using paypal to receive payments . 
  paypal is popular for that , because anyone can set it up easily and lots of people are willing to use it to make payments . 
  this is in stark contrast to bitcoin , which also can be set up relatively easily , but barely anyone uses to make payments . 
  if a customer wants to pay and you 're using bitcoin , he has to set up his own wallet and buy bitcoins from somewhere else first . 
  if a customer wants to pay and you 're using paypal , he has to have a credit card or a bank account . 
  you have to make it easy for people to pay you , not complicated . 
  setting up a bitcoin wallet and buying bitcoins * is * complicated . 
  like almost everyone , i have a bank account . 
  like most people , i have a credit card . 
  like almost everyone , i do n't have bitcoins . 
  you 're not a unique little snowflake . 
  if you 're making me jump through hoops , i will give my money to someone who does n't . 
   nobody doubts that , but `` it sucks because it is n't popular , it is n't popular because it sucks '' is n't a good argument ... 
  yes , it is . 
  having people give you money is the only reason for having a payment processor . 
  if people wo n't use it , it 's worthless . 
   it is classic chicken-and-egg situation , which pretty much every new technology faces , and each successful technology finds a way through it . 
  you should n't focus on it when you discuss merits of technology because it 's rather boring . 
  when discussing payment methods , there is one thing that trumps absolutely everything else , and that thing is ** `` do i actually receive payments with this '' ** because that 's literally the only reason for talking about this topic . 
  not only should you focus on this aspect , but you ** have ** to focus on it , because otherwise you 're completely missing the point . 
  bitcoin is currently not in a state , where it can be used as the only payment method for anything but hobbyists and the most niche businesses . 
  paypal is . 
  that 's why replacing paypal with bitcoin does n't make any sense . 
   you should not be looking for a european alternative . 
  you should be looking for an open-source alternative . 
  with open-source anyone with understanding of programming can check that the product does not spy on you . 
  that does n't apply to services someone else hosts for you . 
  you have no way of verifying what software they actually run , what else they run and what else is going on in their datacenter . 
   think about the technology and encoding standards of the 40 's - 60 's and then tell me that computers today could n't easily solve them today . 
   tl ; dr : stuff encrypted today stands no chance against the computers of tomorrow . 
  we do n't use encryption from the 40s and 60s . 
  the field is vastly better understood today than it was then . 
  a 128bit aes key ca n't feasibly be bruteforced . 
  the energy requirements alone are prohibitive . 
  if computing power increases in the next 70 years by the same factor as it did in the last 70 years , that still wo n't be enough - not even close . 
  the time requirement would move from quadrillions of years to billions of years . 
  you 'd have to do an improvement by the same factor twice over to get anywhere , and we do n't even know if that 's physically possible . 
  quantum computers would speed up the process immensely , but can be trivially counteracted by doubling the key size . 
  barring an unknown weakness in the algorithm , 256bit aes keys wo n't be brute forced in your lifetime , or more likely anyone 's lifetime . 
   how completely sad !!!, 
  i wish we could find a way of circumventing the almighty $ $ machine . 
  you buy shit , you sell it at a profit , the profit gets taxed and that taxes pay for the roads you drive on , the school you went to and the firemen that make sure your house does n't burn down . 
  that 's how modern society works . 
  you do n't like it , move to somalia , see how you like it without taxes and the stuff taxes buy . 
   when we pay that money ( which we have to , according to the law ) we not only lose more than we could have ( i say `` we '' collectively , not each one of us ai . 
  `` you '' ) because we 're paying something ( interests ) that was n't previously created/in existence , but the money we 're left with also loses value . 
  no , that 's not how it works . 
  if you do n't take out loans , you do n't have to pay interest . 
  also you ca n't pay with money that was n't created/in existence , because it has to exist for you to be able to pay with it . 
  i would be glad if i could pay back loans with non-existant money , but that 's not how it works either . 
  i can see vaguely , where you 're trying to go with this , but either you do n't understand the matter very well or just ca n't express yourself well . 
  funnily enough , having to pay massive amounts of interest just for the privilege of having money is one of the key features of an alternative to the current monetary system that often gets proposed by critics . 
   oh , really ? 
  some time ago my dad wanted to buy something from an online auction ... and he needed a new debit card to do this . 
  so here 's the whole process , from having cash at hand to paying : do you honestly believe that most people need a new debit card to set up a paypal account ? 
  or even that anyone but your dad 's ass-backwards shitty bank blocks internet payments by default ? 
  if not , then why are you even making that argument ? 
  if so , just how out of touch are you ? 
  here are the steps for the average person for paying with paypal : 1 . 
  enter credit card info . 
  there is no step 2 . 
  paypal can function as a payment processor using credit card or direct debit ( depending on the country ) without requiring a paypal account on the side of the customer . 
  all you need is a credit card . 
  in some countries , all you need is a bank account . 
  there 's magnitudes more people who have that already than would ever consider setting up something obscure like a bitcoin wallet . 
  i suppose that depends on how the unification is implemented legally . 
  if catalonia seceded , then catalonia would have to request membership because it 's a new state that did n't exist before - they 'd have to request membership because they are n't members . 
  i guess if romania and moldova merged into an entirely new state , dissolving both existing states in the process , this would have to be negotiated . 
  however if romania just absorbed moldova , then moldova would cease to exist and romania would get bigger , but the `` new '' state would still be romania and carry on with the same memberships and international obligations as romania has now . 
  as far as i know , there is no process to kick someone out of the eu . 
  member states can leave , but they ca n't be removed . 
  it would therefore follow that romania ca n't get kicked out for annexing the territory of moldovia either . 
  i ca n't think of an example of the former , but the latter has a precedent in the german reunification . 
  the german democratic republic divided itself into five states and joined the federal republic of germany . 
  the gdr ceased to exist , the frg carried on as before . 
   there 's actually a movement who advocate for the breaking down of larger eu member states like germany , spain and the uk into their constituent parts because being a big block is n't particularly helpful to them anymore ( or wont be , in the vision of this movement ) this is the first time i hear of this , so i can only assume that this is some kind of irrelevant fringe group . 
  they should have sent them blacked out pdf [ like the british used to use ] ( http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/ministry-of-defence-fails-at-redacting-nuclear-sub-secrets-1229523.html ) . 
  i think he means as opposed to [ justified ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justification_ ( typesetting % 29 ) . 
  anarchism is a type of libertarianism . 
  free-market anarchism is n't a stateless society based on ownership .
