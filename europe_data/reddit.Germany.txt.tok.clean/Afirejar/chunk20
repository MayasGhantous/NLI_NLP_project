  germany can and will always force itself upon other people and has been doing so for over a century . 
  you literally said that the main difference is that one group is german . 
  have fun . 
   i 'm not sure how it can be this hard to you to understand . 
  there is no sharing of migrants/asylum seekers in the eu law that i 'm aware of . 
  please do link if there is such a thing . 
  reread want i said . 
  reread what you said . 
  then either notice that it 's not the same thing or go away . 
  that 's a lie . 
  you gave up `` debating '' when i posted incontrovertible proof that you were wrong , and you responded by sticking your fingers in your ears and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever and repeat your baseless claim without any argument whatsoever . 
  that happened so early in this conversation , that i 'll go as far as saying that you 've never debated in your entire life . 
  then explain how it 's possible that a regulation on which eu country is responsible for which asylum seekers ** already exists ** . 
  will they get asylum in serbia ? 
  stop trying to derail . 
   it 's their choose to grant them or not a refugee status . 
  the word has a definition , dipshit , it 's absolutely not their choice what that definition is . 
  `` we ca n't distribute the refugees fairly , some countries ca n't afford that . 
  let 's keep the current rules and send them all to greece . '', 
  i 'm sure there 's a valid line of reasoning behind that that is n't at all something along the lines of `` fuck you , i 've got mine '' . 
   if there would be an eu law that says it member countries have to accept refugees if they meet certation conditions then why would merkel want to force quota system upon eu countries ? 
  first of all , there is no mechanism in the eu with which any single country can force anything on anyone , so you 're completely full of shit alone by the way you phrase it . 
  second ,  the dublin regulation sets out is that hungary does n't have to grant asylum if greece is responsible for the asylum claim , and can hand the application off to greece instead and greece is getting swamped , which is why the current method of distributing refugees is shitty . 
  you 'll note that this is a quote from directly above , so stop chanting and get your head out of your ass . 
  now riddle me this , genius : if there 's no law that makes countries accept refugees , then ** why the fuck is there a law that regulates who is responsible for which refugees ** . 
  if you 're not going to take any , then why the fuck would anyone make you solely responsible for some . 
  before you go on to explain that it 's all an elaborate scheme to be able to kick people out without having to say so , please keep in mind that most people are n't the pathetic word-mincing hypocrites you see here in these reddit threads . 
   so countries have to implement it but can change it 's conditions . 
  what part of `` countries have to implement it '' do you not understand ? 
  if the directive flat-out says you have to take in refugees , and your law to implement it says you wo n't , then you did n't `` implement it but change it 's conditions '' - you just plain * did n't * implement it . 
   still does n't force countries to accept refugees , they can choose on their own if they want them or not . 
  at this point you 're not even posting arguments . 
  you 're just holding your hands over your ears , ignore everything i say and blindly repeat your mantra . 
  but at least i 'm glad that we moved the discussion from you not understanding what legislation on refugees and asylum there is on the eu level to you not understanding what legislation on the eu level is . 
   you claimed that hungary does n't care about laws because of it 's right-wing goverment . 
  what i said was that hungary has a right-wing government that does n't care about the law . 
  there 's a difference . 
   it just proves my point . 
  no , it really , really does n't . 
   a directive shall be binding , as to the result to be achieved , upon each member state https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directive_ ( european_union ) #legal _ basis there 's a world of a difference between what your quote actually says ( `` having a certain amount of leeway '' in implementing it ) and what you make of it , which is treating like a non-binding suggestion that countries can just ignore . 
  by the way , here 's one more relevant link before i end this charade : http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/  there are no eu laws that makes countries mandatory to accept refugees . 
   \\* someone links eu directives that do exactly that \\*  it 's just a standard to help member countries . 
  there are no laws . 
   \\* links wikipedia article that explains that member states have to imeplement directives \\*  it just proves my point . 
  this is pointless . 
   what you linked is just a standard to help member countries . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directive_ ( european_union ), 
  since the iraq war utterly failed at producing anything even vaguely resembling a safe , stable country and we will in fact have to go back into iraq as well to have any hope of fixing syria - no , we 're not talking that . 
  we 're talking about something significantly bigger . 
  not to mention that it 's not an `` either-or '' thing . 
  fixing syria and iraq by this time next year wo n't retroactively make the refugees disappear . 
  greece certainly is n't . 
  can you remind me where a lot of refugees arrive again , i seem to have forgotten . 
  `` we ca n't afford it '' is hardly an argument against distributing refugees around the member states - in fact it 's a very strong argument in favor of distributing refugees around the member states while taking economic power into account . 
   there are no eu laws that makes countries mandatory to accept refugees . 
  not true . 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2011:337:0009:0026:en:pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:l33150 member states have to grant refugee status to anyone who meets the definitions set out in that document , and then accept them according to that other document . 
   in fact according to dublin regulation [ 1 ] the ones who applied for asylum in hungary had no right to do so since the first eu country they entered was greece . 
  not true either . 
  refugees have a right to apply for asylum anywhere . 
  anything else would be bloody stupid , because how 'd you know if someone was entitled to apply without an application to check - have them apply for permission to apply ? 
  all the dublin regulation sets out is that hungary does n't have to grant asylum if greece is responsible for the asylum claim , and can hand the application off to greece instead . 
  hungary can even grant the asylum claim anyway . 
  if greece was overwhelmed with refugees , they might even have to . 
   you are failing to see his argument , and resort of childish barbs . 
  i reject his argument . 
  learn the difference . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with his argument because i 'm `` failing to see it '' , i 'm disagreeing with it because it 's shit . 
   the point is , this crisis did not exist when the economic crisis hit . 
  the point is that the situations are n't even remotely comparable , and we 're not basing our country 's politics and humanitarian efforts on some entitled hicks feeling that if refugees from a literal warzone are helped out , that means that they and their perfectly safe country should have gotten a billion euro handout too . 
  edit : by the way , if you 're actually want to convince germans of that position , then be advised that continually talking about '' * imposed * austerity '' and thereby proving that you do n't understand the concept of `` not being able to afford shit because you ran out of money '' wo n't garner any sympathies in germany . 
  right . 
  because there are countries in the eu where refugee accomodations are worse than they are in an overcrowded camp in jordan , or lebanon , or turkey , or iraqi kurdistan . 
  do you know what the `` barrier '' is that is holding the refugees back ? 
  geographical distance . 
   ( if you still do n't understand , my post meant `` why does n't america try to take on more refugees '' , not `` why is america not overflowing with syrians '' ) `` why does n't america ... '' is still a dumb question . 
  why single them out ? 
  name one country that is actively bringing in refugees on a large scale . 
   since all of them had to travel through safe countries , like serbia , macedonia , greece , turkey , only less than 300 of them got granted some sort of refugee status . 
  that 's only a rule in hungary , and a violation of eu norms . 
  so it is true , it 's just that he would be rejected in hungary because hungary is run by a right-wing government that does n't give a fuck about the law . 
   and yes you are to blame for encouraging them so you can keep them . 
  do you ingrateful fuck-ups not know why germany pushes to change the dublin-ii regulations ? 
  it 's because those regulations ** force you to keep them all . 
  ** you morons are pushing to keep over a million refugees in your country , and you 're too ignorant dumbasses to even realize it . 
   why does n't america take more refugees anyways ? 
  it 's called an `` ocean '' . 
  if you do n't know what it is , look it up . 
  if they truly think that they have it as bad as people coming from a literal warzone , they 're free to apply for asylum as well . 
   because the germany , being the most powerful eu nation , has been ordering other countries around and declining any eu-wide stimulus on the basis of assumption that you must save money and keep the financial discipline at all costs . 
  seeing them throwing tons of euros at the citizens of third countries when many in europe are left jobless under what they perceive as germany-imposed austerity makes them quite understandably furious . 
  `` germany-imposed austerity '' , otherwise known as `` damn those germans for not giving us handouts '' . 
  guy who says his country should n't take in refugees downvotes germans and justifies it by their being german . 
  why am i not surprised . 
  racists gon na racist . 
   the eu does n't have jurisdiction in the issue . 
  that is patently untrue . 
  there is already a number of eu directives on the subject , both on who is reponsible for asylum claims and on minimum standards for when asylum has to be granted . 
  these syrian refugees ** will ** be taken in by one eu country or another . 
  that is what the rule already is .
