  it 's like saying a woman should date short people also because dating only tall men is offensive . 
  i do n't know what it is with you guys and dating metaphors , but if you really need a specific reason why the eu member states are n't like a woman 's dating preferences :  1 . 
  any discrimination based on any ground such as sex , race , colour , ethnic or social origin , genetic features , language , religion or belief , political or any other opinion , membership of a national minority , property , birth , disability , age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited . 
  eu member states are n't allowed to discriminate based on religion because they signed a treaty that says so . 
  and it 's fucking embarassing how many people here have to be told that this exists . 
  * these are your rights too . 
  i should n't have to tell you that . 
  you 're supposed to know this shit . 
   nations are neither shops , nor hotels . 
  neither are they people looking for dates . 
   they 're allowed to chose who they want and who they do n't . 
  so can shops - within the legislative framework they operate in . 
  as it turns out , the eu is in fact not comprised of absolutist monarchies or autocratic dictatorships and governments can in fact not do whatever they please . 
   no , you deport them back to the first safe country of passage . 
  you ca n't deport people to random countries . 
  that 's not how it works . 
   fortunately for me i live in a country which accepts the reality the way it is . 
  right . 
  because `` those people who fled from a warzone are just economic migrants '' is `` accepting reality '' . 
  then i guess you can just deport them back to their home country , right ? 
  oh wait , you ca n't . 
  that 's illegal because the home country of these `` economic migrants '' * is a fucking warzone * . 
   it 's physically impossible to reach slovakia without entering the bordering countries ( unless the illegal migrants charter a plane ) . 
  last time i checked all of slovakia 's bordering regions are perfectly safe . 
  therefore those who wish to reach slovakia or transit through slovakia are economic refugees , well , unfortunately for you that is n't how that works . 
  people who flee from a warzone are not economic migrants , no matter how convenient that would be . 
  that 's just intellectually dishonest . 
  besides , where would you deport them to ? 
  back to the warzone ? 
   who will be forced to live in slovakia against their will . 
  i doubt that that 's how it 's going to work . 
  you should let the slovakian interior ministry know of your idea . 
  it 's a much better justification than the one they came up with , which is `` they would n't like it here anyway , we do n't even have mosques '' . 
  that 's a false dichotomy . 
  you do n't . 
  you just do n't deliberately exclude people because of their religion . 
  how did you arrive at that question ? 
  `` well , we have to select based on religion * somehow * ? '', 
  also lol at the notion that muslims are `` minorities '' among syrian refugees . 
  they do n't have any obligation to pay each citizen 10 bucks either , but deciding to pay every christian citizen 10 bucks would still be discriminatory . 
  quite frankly , i do n't understand what 's so hard to get about the fact that whether something is discriminatory or not depends on the thing and not whether they 're forced to do the thing . 
   based on where they 're coming from , all of them would be eligible , so we 're at square one again . 
  if i remember the last numbers for germany correctly , about a quarter of asylum claims end for formal reasons that do n't have anything to do with refugee status or who `` deserves '' asylum ( application withdrawn , etc. ) . 
  of the rest , about half get accepted . 
  edit : bonus fact for the `` european people '' crowd : single biggest group of asylum seekers that come to germany by a wide margin ? 
  people from the balkans , taken together - kosovo , albania , mazedonia , serbia . 
  that 's why there are so many rejections . 
  well , in that case i 'm going to contend that the people who speak out against asylum seekers secretly agree with me and only lie because they 're afraid that it will cost them votes . 
  it does n't matter who you think will reach slovakia . 
  we 're still not talking about economic migrants . 
  if your entire point is that slovakia should n't take in economic migrants , then take note of the fact that no one is asking them to and go away . 
   besides , this is not discriminatory at all in any way , shape , or form . 
  they 're rejecting muslims for no reason other than that they 're muslims . 
  how the fuck is that not discriminatory ? 
  in what world do you live ? 
   i 'm pretty sure slovakia would be happy to pay a multi-billion fine to the eu rather than taking in an unlimited number of economic migrants . 
  we 're not talking about economic migrants . 
   on the other hand , i can see how it may be interpreted as discriminatory . 
  is that because it blatantly is ? 
  stop . 
  just stop . 
  `` at least he 's not afraid to say what he thinks because of political correctness '' is such a disgustingly arrogant notion . 
  have you ever considered that other people are n't any less `` afraid '' , that they say the `` politically correct '' things they say because that 's actually what their opinion is ? 
   the ** billions ** put towards that useless fence i think that it 's necessary to clarify that statement and point out that that 's billions of * hungarian forint * , where 1 forint is about 0.3 cents . 
  the cost in euros is more on the order of tens of millions . 
   it 's just a fact , when you leave a safe country ( and cross something like 5 another safe countries to reach germany ) you ca n't be named a refugee . 
  it 's also very convenient because mincing words like that makes it absolutely certain that there will never ever be even a single `` real '' refugee in our countries . 
   and i 've never heard of any refugees being deported in germany . 
  and you 're probably arrogant enough to think that means no one is deported , ever . 
  if other countries do n't want to take in refugees , then they should stop making bullshit excuses and at least have the guts to say it . 
  maybe that 's a false dichotomy . 
   this is a classic example of free flowing uncontroled and unchecked immigration . 
  no , it 's not . 
   when a country allows immigration you really need to look at who is coming in and how they might integrate we do . 
  mostly refugees from a warzone and economic migrants . 
  the former are allowed to stay for humanitarian reasons , the latter are deported . 
   now you have a peacfull country in western europe facing sectarian violence between different islamic factions ( just think about that for a moment ) . 
  what 's the point of fleeing a war zone when you bring it with you ? 
  the refugees are bringing what here ? 
  did you not read the article ? 
   so , it comes down to this . 
  germany is set on being the ultimate humane , refugee-friendly country . 
  determined to put significant resources into handling this issue . 
  alternative is not going to happen . 
  approach any country in the world and tell them that you want to save a bit of money and that 's why they need to scrap their constitution and come up with an entirely new one , see what happens . 
   on the other side , there are a lot of countries in europe that wo n't step up , for whatever reason . 
  they ca n't afford it , mostly . 
  that say `` here is what we offer to the refugees , and if that 's not enough - tough luck . 
  try elsewhere . '', 
  why should germany impose its view on the matter on the rest of europe , that is unwilling or unable to match its offer ? 
  i have already said it here , and i will say it again - you guys need to shut the fuck up about germany . 
  germany can handle the current rules . 
  we 're going to take in way more than we have to under the current rules precisely because the rest of the eu is of course perfectly fine with saving money by dumping the entire problem on a few border nations . 
  do n't tell the germans why you want them to handle a massive amount of refugees , ** tell the greek ** . 
   okay , greece and italy have it bad , because of their geography . 
  but where exactly do you thing refugees will have it better ? 
  that 's not the point . 
   even rich countries ... uk says `` no , thanks '' . 
   the only way to stop influx in germany is to make germany less attractive to refugees . 
  this will , in turn , make europe less attractive as a whole , and solve some of the problems greeks have .
