  cause i think it was n't . 
  the npd was founded in 1964 . 
  they never got a single seat in a federal election . 
  i 'd ask how someone can be so delusional as to think the people behind him even though his ideology has been failing at the election booths for more than half a century , but that 's probably the thing you 're least delusional about . 
   no but then why the fuck do you have to ask who these politicians are that tried and failed . 
   also who are those million politicians that tried and failed ? 
  do you think immigration is a new thing that only appeared just this month and only in austria ? 
  my point is that it either is or is n't a shit option that does n't work , and that 's completely independent of whether the guy who says that can think of something better . 
  i do n't need to succeed where a million politicians have tried and failed for decades and come up with a good way to make people integrate to point out that making kids speak german for their half-hour of recess will accomplish about as much as my fish hat idea . 
   if you zoom out to a european scale there clearly is a problem . 
  it 's also really convenient that the relevant statistics on the european scale are for the eu and do n't include norway . 
  there 's one difference between attacks by islamists and attacks by right-wing extremists , which is that islamists have commited some high-profile attacks with a large death toll while right-wing extremists have commited a fuckton of small attacks . 
   you can not flood a country with problematic foreigners while ignoring the public and not expect someone to lash out in anger . 
  people do n't turn to extemes unless they feel they have no other option . 
  please stop justifying terrorism as a valid course of action for when your fringe opinion does n't have a chance in the democratic elections . 
  do you think making everyone put a fish on their heads will improve integration ? 
  you 'll notice that ** an isp doing something on their own is n't a fucking government policy . 
  ** the government does n't have to provide justification and arguments ** for the actions of other people ** . 
  do you ask david cameron how he justifies your local supermarket not carrying froot loops ? 
  reading this comment chain , one could almost get the impression that you people have no fucking clue what net neutrality is about . 
  a license to distribute a movie does n't cost the same as that movie on bluray . 
  1000 $ worth of movie distribution rights is nothing . 
   the government does block a few torrent sites at the dns level but i do n't see how they 'd justify throttling torrenting or vpn 's as a whole . 
  the government does n't have to justify shit when they are n't the ones doing it . 
   how is that a lie ? 
  merkel did ask orban , and that ** would be ** required by dublin indeed if hungary was a point of entry to the eu for all refugees . 
  that you meant `` merkel wants hungary to take in literally all refugees '' instead of `` all refugees that enter the eu through hungary '' really is n't a defense , dipshit . 
  that 's not even a lie anymore , it 's just insane . 
  it has no basis in reality whatsoever . 
   merkel invited these people do you actually have an argument that is n't a blatant lie ? 
   not everything is up to the eu to decide the thing we 're talking about is . 
  stop trying to derail . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  how is that in any way an answer to what i wrote ? 
  maybe someone with better reading comprehension can explain it to you . 
   germany is not the eu . 
  exactly , and refugee quotas are a decision made by the eu , not by germany . 
  you said it wrong , not me . 
   and merkel did not discuss anything with eu leaders , just announced that all syrians are welcome . 
  yeah , that never happened . 
  you 're trying to back up a lie by piling on more lies . 
  what happened is that germany announced that syrians would n't be deported from germany to other countries , one of which was hungary . 
  somehow this outrage about germany not deporting syrian refugees to hungary does n't seem consistent with anything else you say , do n't you think ? 
  do you actually have an opinion on this or are you just blindly regurgitating the usual right-wing propaganda talking points ? 
   and you want to be rude and tough to the eu members you asked why hungary ca n't decide that by itself , i told you why . 
  you do n't like it ? 
  tough shit . 
  you 're going to have to deal with the reality that exists , just like everyone else in the world . 
  you want to make all decisions by yourself ? 
  do n't be in the eu . 
  what else do you want me to say ? 
  should i lie to you , like other people have obviously done , and pretend that there is a way where hungary can ignore any eu level decision it does n't like and still stay in the eu ? 
  i wo n't , because there is n't . 
   while can not even dare to say anything but `` welcome all '' with a smile to the refugees ? 
  `` can not even dare '' ? 
  how delusional do you have to be to arrive at a point where you think that literally the entire world secretly agrees with you , and everyone who does n't is just pretending because he 's afraid to speak up ? 
  that 's quite literally insane . 
   well , i was too lazy to write `` it was forced by a majority of eu countries , but they were leadby germany , the loudest and most powerful supporter of quotas '' - but of course you 're free to believe that this is just an excuse and that it was a purposeful lie . 
  quite frankly , `` i posted the exact same lie as a fuckton of other people on here because i 'd rather portray myself as an ignorant dumbass than type four additional words '' is n't exactly believable . 
  but if you insist i 'll keep in mind that you chose your arguments based on letter count instead of logic or truth . 
   lol , here it comes :d well , you had your choice of arguments and you chose to go with an obvious lie . 
  you tell me why you thought that was your best bet . 
   it really sucks living in a border town meh . 
  i 've spent my entire life living in that 30km zone , and not once have i been searched . 
  if you want to make every decision completely egotistically just by yourself , then leave the eu . 
  you do n't like not having access to the eu and not getting billions in subsidies ? 
  well , tough shit . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it . 
   why does n't germany force quotas on uk , usa or russia ? 
  because it lacks the power to do that , unlike czech rep etc. 
  germany ca n't force anyone to do anything . 
  that 's just a lie people like you spread to rile up sentiment against a policy you oppose , but have zero arguments against that do n't make you look like a racist . 
  any distribution quota would come from a majority vote of eu member states , a union which the czech republic freely joined and is free to leave . 
  it should be obvious from context that `` eastern european countries '' means `` countries that existed at that time '' and does n't include parts of the soviet union that became independent later . 
   i think that you had missed the context look at what i had responded too . 
  there is no context that could possibly justify your belief that someone can have threatened you without having said or done anything , but solely because a third party claimed that they would do something . 
  there is nothing rational or explainable about this . 
  it does n't make sense on any level . 
  it 's completely insane . 
  i do n't know how full of hate someone has to be to say something like that with a straight face . 
  some random people saying something about the refugees is n't the refugees threatening you . 
  it just is n't . 
  i 'm really at a loss for words here . 
  you 're insane . 
   except people actually believe that you need to give them money to make them less violent oh my god , are you really using your own prejudice as an argument ? 
  you hold it against the refugees that people are prejudiced against them ? 
  you say ** someone else ** claiming that they would turn violent constitutes ** them ** threatening people , even though you ** know ** that they have nothing to do with that ? 
  if someone else claims that i 'll beat you up , and you believe it , then * i * threatened you ? 
  that kind of fucked up logic is really a new low . 
  you 're insane . 
   just call up the saudis to build a mosque obligatory reminder that the saudis never offered to build mosques . 
   because different groups of people need to be treated differently ? 
  you cant treat a refugee from syria the same as you treat a farmer from albania . 
  oh god , not this shit again . 
  ** we fucking do n't . 
  there is no one that says we should . 
  ** this is why it 's impossible to have a discussion about this topic - because there 's always some dishonest piece of shit that derails the conversation with this blatant propaganda shit . 
  * `` oh no , we ca n't treat economic migrants the same as refugees . 
  '' * - ** we fucking do n't , now shut up and go away . 
   with nobody differentiating im refering to countries not differentiating between types of refugees .
