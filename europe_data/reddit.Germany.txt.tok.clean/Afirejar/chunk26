   ( ... )  this is beeing compleltey ignored by the media . 
  they treat it as the same thing . 
  * what 's your fucking point ? 
  * you already said that people do n't differentiate , blablabla . 
  i 'm asking * why it matters * . 
   as judged by the great authority that is ... you . 
  as judged by your complete incapability to explain why it 's not . 
  i already asked twice , and all i got was more explainations of what your opinion is without a single argument . 
  you think that these details are ignored . 
  i got it . 
  * now why the fuck does this matter ? 
  *  sweden , its on this very sub . 
  there 's a fuckton of stuff on this sub . 
  since i ca n't find it with the search function or on google and it seems completely outlandish , i 'm going to assume that sweden did in fact not demand that asylum be permanent throughout the eu until you manage to cough up a reputable source that says otherwise . 
   give ** them ** money or ** they ** will be violent sounds like a threat to me . 
  `` hey , everyone , offer / u/batose a job or he 'll get violent ! '', 
  `` oh , why , that / u/batose sure is a jackass , what with him running around and threatening people for not offering him a job . 
  nobody should employ him . 
  as his boss i 'm firing him right now for threatening people . '', 
  according to you , that makes perfect sense . 
  sure , it 's just merkel . 
  you keep telling yourself that . 
  whatever helps you look at yourself in the mirror . 
   between 1945 and 1991 , soviet tanks came rolling 2 times . 
  three times , and that 's really all it takes . 
  poland was a satellite state . 
  but a state nonetheless . 
  all the eastern european countries were technically independent states . 
  until they stepped too far out of line , then the soviet tanks came rolling in to demonstrate how much of a state they really were . 
   that was just elite policy . 
  sure , and they made the laws . 
  hence my assuming that divorces were possible . 
   it 's reasonable to assume that ireland would define itself fiercely against the uk by whatever means . 
  as for italy ... they 're nutbags . 
  it 's funny that the italians are `` nutbags '' for allowing divorces in only 1970 , while the irish are n't despite repealing their constitutional ban on divorces ( yes , they had actually put it into the constitution ) twenty-five years later in 1995 by a razor-thin margin . 
  ( not to say that the irish are nutbags for being so late to the party . 
  every country has some skeletons in the closet . 
  germany made it illegal to rape your wife in 1998 , which was surprisingly controversial at the time . ), 
   do n't like the conditions in hungary ? 
  pay up . 
  how about you do n't deliberately misquote what i responded to . 
   ireland , poland , italy , spain , portugal - all rampantly catholic . 
  yet , a huge spread . 
  poland used to be a satellite state of the ( famously irreligious ) soviet union , so i assume divorce was possible . 
  italy and ireland had banned divorce for a long time , but that was under democratic governments and could have been voted out any time . 
  conversely , in portugal and spain the respective dictatorships enforced divorce rules of the catholic church ( i.e. 
  there essentially was none ) , and that went away soon after the countries became democratic . 
  one ca n't help but wonder if it 's some kind of backlash . 
  the priest scandal was before 2010 , right ? 
  i ask because according to wikipedia 90 % of the population identified as christian in the 2011 census , and church attendance is still among the highest in the western world . 
  i 'm just glad history gave you something to say when you run out of arguments . 
  do n't like behaving like you 're in the eu ? 
  get the fuck out of the eu . 
  i 'm sure we 'll find some other place to spend five billion euros a year on . 
   we 're talking about the refugee crisis . 
  no , we 're talking about the priority that had been given to ** recognized refugees ** for social housing in the netherlands . 
  trying to bring albanian economic migrants into this is just dishonest as fuck . 
  those * never * had priority because they do n't get recognized as refugees . 
   the problem is that nobody differentiates . 
  refugees get asylum in the first safe country , not in the one they want to get asylum in . 
  quite frankly , the constant mindless and intellectually dishonest screaming of `` muh dublin agreement '' long after everyone realized that dumping everyone to greece does n't work anymore is far more of a problem than that `` nobody differentiates '' . 
   and asylum is not permanent , this is also something that is conveniently ignored especialy by countries like sweden . 
  what 's your point ? 
  do you mean to imply that the current refugee crisis is because of people who are still here after conditions in their home countries have improved ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  also , who said that asylum had to be permanent ? 
  that 's a strawman argument . 
  it 's also a blatant lie to say that `` asylum is not permanent '' and that some countries `` conveniently ignore '' that . 
  while it 's true that asylum is typically not permanent , that 's not a rule . 
  there are multiple eu directives that set minimum standards , but there 's no upper limits on how many people a country wants to take in for how long . 
  that 's just completely made up . 
   also what is ignored is that political asylum = / = protection from war . 
   political asylum is permanent but that only includes people that need protection from political persecution . 
  again : what 's your point ? 
   its not just `` idiots dont know that refugees have rights '' , the issue is far more complex than that . 
  if you wanted to point out the complexity of the issue when you brought up numerous things that are somewhat true but also completely irrelevant , then you have failed . 
   why ? 
  honest question . 
  that 's a strawman argument . 
  no one here argued that . 
  you were the one who said `` locking them up '' has `` solved that problem '' , and that 's just a load of crap . 
  that does n't mean that `` locking people up '' solves the problem of crime . 
  i think that not doing the reasonable thing purely out of spite is `` antagonizing '' . 
   but let 's not pretend that only the right-wing is using arguments against taking in refugees that only apply to migrants . 
  why ? 
  do you think economic migrants typically have university degrees ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
   the point still stands though that taking in refugees should be done out of moral principles keeping in mind that there just are economic limits this is what you said :  if they are arguing about taking in refugees , then they should do so on moral principles i stand by my saying that that is completely disingenious to the point of sounding like a deliberate attempt to sabotage the discussion by goading supporters of taking in refugees into presenting themselves as naive bleeding-heart do-gooders . 
  `` we should take in refugees out of moral principles '' is n't even remotely the same thing as `` you should only argue for taking in refugees on moral principles , not even to refute something '' . 
   i see no particular shame in not caring for someone who is willing to use or threaten violence unless their demands are met . 
  ** some random dude claiming that someone else might possibly turn violent unless certain steps are taken does n't constitute a threat by that person for fucks sake . 
  `` someone else being afraid of you without you doing anything '' does n't constitute a threat . 
  just how daft are you . 
  **  should we start placating economically unlucky people who threaten us because we understand their motivation ? 
  so far society has solved that problem by locking them up , but i suppose you disagree ? 
  that 's not how `` society '' has solved that problem . 
  that 's how the usa has `` solved '' that problem . 
   what if we do n't care how they feel ? 
  you do n't get to complain that people are hostile after deliberately antagonizing them . 
   if hungary tells them no on asylum claims , they ca n't just destroy the border and force themselves in .
