   unfortunately small eu countries are not always in position to withstand bullying by countries who went insane . 
  leaving is always an option . 
  if you hate the eu so much , then stop taking our money and fuck off . 
   and because they 're coming directly from a war zones in senegal , bangladesh , ghana etc. 
  the vast majority of asylum seekers do n't come from senegal , bangladesh or ghana . 
  senegal and bangladesh do n't even make the top ten , and ghana is so few that it gets subsumed under `` other '' . 
  europe gets more serbian asylum seekers than all of those countries combined , i wonder why no one ever mentions those . 
  here 's a question : if you 're so right about this , then why is all i ever hear from you people lies and propaganda and yet more lies ? 
   cause germany totaly does n't have the most powerful blackmail in europe . 
  the euro . 
  what decisions do you think germany can make about the euro without the agreement of the other eurozone countries ? 
  you 're arguing that these countries are blackmailing themselves . 
  * but they do n't even . 
  * bigger countries have more votes , but not that much more . 
  it 's more like `` a country with 80 million people has five times as many representatives as 8 million people '' . 
  the system is already intentionally set up to massively overrepresent small countries . 
   right , because the most effective way of running a country is have every person dedicate their time and effort towards it . 
  it 's not even inefficient . 
  it 's just naive . 
  that simply wo n't happen . 
  it ca n't happen . 
  we might as well save ourselves the effort and just hand the country over to the group with the biggest propganda machine directly . 
  it would save everyone a lot of money and effort , and it 's not like there 's any difference . 
   the people coming into slovakia are n't refugees . 
  they pass through many safe countries . 
  that is n't what the definition is . 
  i think the entire moral argument whether you should or should n't take in refugees started and ended at the point where you tried to redefine what a `` refugee '' is . 
   because if you disagree with their ridiculous ideas you 're `` against progress '' you smear them as enemies of the state and claim that they 're literally out to destroy us all simply because you disagree with their political positions . 
  you 're in no position to criticize anyone . 
   i think you can get a comprehensive picture by looking at all the news , articles , videos and occurances about the refugee situation . 
  do you think instances where nothing happens get reported ? 
   so you think it needs to be reported if people dont bully , assault and threaten to murder others for completely made up , ridiculous , arbitrary religious reasons ? 
  i do n't , but you apparently do since you think that looking at what gets reported will get you an accurate picture of the situation . 
   the media , teachers in our schools , and even other refugees admit and try to show us that there are massive problems , what else do you need to recognize that ? 
  what needs to happen for you to see systematic problems and not just rare single occurances ? 
  a comprehensive look at the situation with a scientific approach . 
  do you have something like that ? 
  do you even understand why the zdf documentary is n't even remotely something like that ? 
   they mention 5 cases , do you think every single one gets reported ? 
  do you think instances where nothing happens get reported ? 
   do you actually think zdf tries to make muslims look bad ? 
  if even they realize the problems and dare to make a documentation thats not 100 % pro islam/foreigners you know the situation is pretty bad . 
  a documentary featuring a few anecdotes is inherently unable to show the large scale situation . 
  it does n't say what you think it says because it ca n't possibly say what you think it says . 
  it means something a little bit different in every country around the world . 
  it means something * completely * different in only one country . 
   you 've purposefully refused to have a discussion yes , i did . 
  edit : while we 're still not having a discussion , i 'd like to point out ( in the interest of any poor guy you might manage to lure into a shouting match in the future ) that `` refute '' and `` dispute '' are n't synonyms , and neither are `` biggest '' and `` only '' . 
  there is nothing to derail . 
  we are n't having a discussion . 
   real adult debate if i ever see a `` real adult debate '' start with `` you moron '' , i 'll certainly be willing to revisit this issue . 
   and focusing solely ( on purpose i suspect ) on the comments that upset you . 
  no , actually i intended to engage in a discussion , but then i stumbled and fell on my keyboard . 
  that the keys i fell on just happened to spell out a comment focusing on your insult was a total accident , i swear !, 
  ah , the old `` you disagree , obviously you must not have understood what i said '' . 
  thanks for confirming that i made the right decision . 
   you moron thanks for sparing me the discussion . 
  `` we demand that the eu predict the future !, 
  anything less is unfair for britain ! '', 
  seriously , stop wasting everyone 's time . 
  if you want to leave , then just get the fuck out . 
  also the biggest democratic deficit in the eu is the constant whining about the lack of democracy itself . 
  yes , keep swallowing the propaganda . 
  everyone who has any say in the eu was elected , either by the people or by someone elected by the people . 
  with that amount of deliberate lying , it 's a wonder it 's only 56 % . 
   not even the pro-eu liberal democrats it was heavily implied . 
   within all schools there are divisions based on which level of class you want to take . 
  for example , every junior has to take an english class , however most schools offer basic , honors , and ap ( college level that actually sounds like a pretty good system . 
  i also went to a gymnasium and my experience has been very similar to yours . 
   further addition to germany : schools are in classes ( that stay more or less the same ) until year 11 . 
  from 11-13 they are organized in courses and basically everything is mixed up . 
  it should perhaps be noted that in germany , the organization of the school system is up to the individual * bundesland * ( state ) , so this may or may not apply . 
  for example , in bavaria there is currently no year 13 ( although there still was when i was in school ) . 
  i 'll just point to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_germany#primary_education ) for further details . 
  we had a prom of sorts , but no contests to speak of and no cheerleaders . 
  a school sports team apparently existed ( or so i 'm told ) but was wholly unimportant . 
   we made the greeks elect a government that does all of our biddings we did that ? 
  how did that happen ? 
  how do you make an entire people elect a specific government ? 
   the european commission is not elected by the people neither is the german chancellor . 
  or v\u00e1clav klaus for that matter . 
  so what ? 
   they are the only people calling the shots in terms of legislation and the daily running of the eu lies . 
  nothing happens without the european parliament . 
   you do n't think this is affecting them ? 
  the unwillingness of germany to allow any measure that would require real sacrifice of west europe ? 
  the enormous pressure on the greek government to enact austerity despite recession ? 
  the creation of fear which lead to the election of a right wing party ? 
  yes , clearly this is what i meant when i said nothing even remotely similar to that . 
   but whatever . 
  what i find most striking is so much energy spent on job positions which per definition only an almost insignificant minority -- men or women -- will ever be able to obtain . 
  this is the top political elite making a lot of fuss about the top elite of the private sector . 
  perhaps one day we could move our political elite to interest themselves for the 99.9 % you 're not arguing that politicians should interest themselves in the problems of the majority . 
  you 're arguing that politicians should n't interest themselves in the problems of small minorities . 
  do n't do that . 
  one does n't preclude the other , and you wo n't be able to argue otherwise because there 's a whole shitload of legislation for every aspect of modern society . 
  you 'll just sound like you 're saying `` i want them to spend all ressources on solving my problems and everyone else can go fuck themselves '' every single time . 
  nothing is wrong with that - ** that 's exactly how the process works ** . 
  no eu position will ever become a law without the agreement of the european parliament , which consists of elected representatives from all member states . 
  this will either have the support of a majority of the elected representatives of the european people , or not go anywhere , ** just like every single other piece of legislation that comes out of the eu ** .
