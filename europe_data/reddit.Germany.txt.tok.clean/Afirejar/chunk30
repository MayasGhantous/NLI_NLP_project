   i will appoint the best talented people to my board be they men or women . 
  do you honestly believe that is how it works ? 
  that there are nine times as many men as women in boards , because women are just less qualified ? 
   it will set baseline of 40 % women with the remainder drawn equally from a mixed pool of men and women . 
  that drifts to a 70:30 split in favour of the women . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  it wo n't in theory , because all the best female candidates are removed from the pool to fill the quota , leaving the average male candidate in the mixed pool significantly more qualified than the average female candidate in the mixed pool . 
  it wo n't in practice , because the gender split is currently 90:10 in favor of men , and it will require a hell of a lot of drifting just to get to 50:50 . 
  and finally , it really wo n't because laws are n't unchangable dogma that we have to live with for all eternity . 
  we make one that will work for the near future , and change it accordingly when the situation changes . 
  if it turns out to become a problem at some point in a few decades we just repeal it then . 
  the problem is this : you ca n't argue that promotion depends solely on ability , because that 's not how it actually works . 
  that 's how it should work , but in the real world it just does n't and the real world is what we have to work with . 
  given that , the law may perhaps not be ok , but it may temporarily be neccessary to bring us closer to that ideal . 
  just stop . 
  the discrimination is there . 
  when almost 9 out of 10 board members are male that 's blindingly obvious . 
  the question is what we 're going to do about it , not whether it exists . 
  that still leaves another problem : you 're essentially saying legislation can only happen if there already is massive support behind it . 
  so basically : if you 're in a niche group like ` women who want to be on company boards ' , then tough luck , sucks to be you , we only do legislation for problems of really popular groups . 
  i do n't think that 's good . 
  equality should n't come down to a popularity contest . 
  there is not a single piece of legislation enacted by the eu , that was n't approved by the european parliament . 
  not a single one . 
  the european commission can do nothing without the parliament . 
  they can introduce legislation , but the parliament can just reject it . 
  they can introduce legislation that will repeal existing legislation , but the parliament can just reject it . 
  without the parliament , the commission is powerless . 
  yes , the european commission is appointed . 
  but it is appointed by the elected governments of the member states , which * are * elected by the people , and the european parliament , which * is * elected by the people , must agree . 
  if they do n't like the appointed members , they can just reject them . 
  the european parliament can also kick the whole bunch out , if they do n't like what the commission does . 
  opponents of the eu would have you believe that there is no democracy whatsoever , that the eu is a bureaucracy that can do anything on a whim , but that 's just a lie you 're being fed to make you oppose the eu . 
  on the eu level , nothing happens without the european parliament . 
  noone said that . 
  but they 're financial situation is bad and this is affecting us . 
  those are facts , and ignoring them wo n't make them go away . 
   ** the solution is n't imposing new laws ** , but rather engaging the people in the cause . 
  as far as my knowledge about the extensions of the rights for women , afro-americans , south africans , homosexuals and the list goes on . 
  all of their rights were incorporated due to activism by those that were oppressed , which gained support from the masses and ** eventually led to changes in the law ** . 
  let me highlight the problem in your thought process . 
  generally , a state needs people , territory and the ability to exert power in its territory to be considered a state . 
  any online thing lacks two of those by definition . 
   i was more talking about the votes , most people do n't bother to comment themselves . 
  when i looked at your comment it was at -7 . 
  this is reddit . 
  it 's a circlejerk . 
  being on the right side of the circlejerk is more important than anything else . 
  of course they 're going to upvote the guy who goes `` hurr durr people should n't get offindid '' and downvote whoever speaks against him . 
  your comments still do n't make sense and you 're still coming off as someone with a severe mental disorder . 
  if you had said that people chose to be depressed , you 'd be downvoted into oblivion , even if that 's the exact same thing . 
   asking me to prove something which is up to interpretation seems futile , does n't it ? 
  how unexpected . 
   i do not , but that was what you were arguing . 
  prove it with a quote . 
   atleast , it seems like a lot of people perceived it that way . 
  there 's only one other guy who responded here , and he disagreed with you and called you `` emotionally stunted '' . 
  you 're completely delusional . 
   i would argue there is something seriously wrong with you if you can not control yourself . 
  you think having an emotion and acting on an emotion is the same thing ? 
  seriously . 
  i should n't have to explain this to you . 
  that 's something a normal human should know from personal experience . 
  there 's something wrong with you . 
   not at the cost of the downfall of european society you do n't get to complain about `` the downfall of european society '' while you whine about how other people are n't sociopaths . 
  `` you 'll get executed if we send you back to your country ? 
  nobody cares , tell me what 's in it for * me * . 
  me me me me me . '', 
  the simple truth is that you 're not trying to prevent the downfall of european society , you 're actually trying your best to deliberately fuck it up yourself because you do n't even like it . 
  dude , i ca n't explain to you what emotions are , but if you do n't understand that people do n't pick and chose what emotions they have then there 's something seriously wrong with you . 
   as long as they , after accomodations , can be of use to the country they 're in , it 's all fime . 
  ( ... )  the conclusion is not that i am for closing borders , but that the process of accepting people in should be much much more strict the conclusion is that you only want to help people who are * useful * to you . 
  the rest can fuck off and die . 
  does n't sound that nice anymore when you stop dressing it up in nice words , does n't it ? 
   people fail to look at the long term cinsequences of their decision . 
  no , they do n't . 
  people do n't look at the long-term consequences of turning our countries into places where people are divided into useful and useless people , and granted or denied rights accordingly . 
   how do they not ? 
  they do n't chose to be afraid either . 
  did n't they tell you this in the alien visitor orientation course ? 
  honestly , the guys at / r/totallynotrobots make more believable humans than you . 
  national laws transposing the framework decision 2008/913/jha of 28 november 2008 . 
   there 's no such thing as `` illegal '' hate-speech in a civilized country . 
  well , apparently there 's a fuckton of countries in the eu that are n't civilized then . 
   b ) opinions that offend people who choose to be offended oh please , stop failing the turing test . 
  humans do n't chose to be offended . 
  no , that does n't imply any right to not be offended , but i 'm still not going to have this discussion with someone who does n't understand human emotion as a concept . 
  that 's something you 'll have to discuss with your therapist . 
  that does n't mean that it 's undefined or vague , it just means that there 's more than one kind of speech that 's illegal . 
  what you 're essentially saying is that there 's a range of things that are illegal , from tax evasion to fraud to theft to murder , and that 's a problem because now you just ca n't tell anymore what is illegal and what is n't . 
   no need to be rude when providing information . 
  i had not seen this document , exactly , which is why i 'm rude . 
  you had n't seen the document , and that did n't stop you from claiming that it 's vague , that it does n't define anything , that it does n't reference existing laws . 
  you had no fucking clue what you were talking about , so you just started making shit up . 
   and the news never referenced it for some reason . 
  this is a direct quote from the article :  the new european union `` code of conduct on illegal online hate speech '' states why the fuck did you think part of the sentence is in quotes . 
   where is it defined ? 
  nowhere in the law . 
  it does n't even reference any existing definition !, 
  read my edit , then read this : http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/files/hate_speech_code_of_conduct_en.pdf this is literally the first result on google when you throw in the quoted name from the article .
