wow , that 's beautiful !, 
  minute 1.17 : a new peninsula has been born where corsica used to be :d seriously , what happened to that map ? 
  hamburg is not too bad , bro, 
  you wo n't die . 
  you will just have the same fun together as proud new soviet citizens . 
  if it was `` die '' ( sing . 
  ) , it would be `` eine euro '' . 
  but forget it , this sounds terrible . 
  [ better ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwguvyvkcu ), 
  it 's interesting how the german flag looks just like the official logo of the german government ( [ example in the upper left corner ] ( http://www.bundesregierung.de/webs/breg/de/startseite/startseite_node.html ) ) . 
  so minimalistic, 
  of course not . 
  i just wanted to point out that christians or jews do n't join them as well . 
  maybe they 're former christians or jews or atheists . 
  but they are n't anymore . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i do n't think she is still jewish if she 's joining muslim fighters . 
  i really like her , so i would n't attend, 
  john 4 , 24 : `` god is a spirit [ ... ] '' . 
  so i do n't think god is in any way physical , bro . 
  that 's so true . 
  especially in germany some people still have issues with patriotism . 
  they think it has to end in nationalism which would be just the beginning of being a nazi . 
  you know it 's crap , most people know it . 
  and we really need a common demoninator to bring immigrants and guys who were born here together . 
  so i think your country is doing it right . 
  i mean you do probably know you 're american although your maybe a thousandth part tuvaluian . 
   know your drinks . 
  i did n't mean guys who stand in front of a crowd telling them what they 've learned by heart . 
  i mean daily spontaneous interactions . 
  but i 'm curious . 
  what german comedy have you watched ? 
  i should try wodzionka . 
  no , it does n't work for me . 
  maybe because i know it 's crap and i think i 've never met a humorless german ... and i live in germany . 
  as a german :d, 
  thanks for that . 
  i 've never expected `` weh '' to exist in english , too . 
  what about dutch ? 
  alright , you 're more german than me . 
  one of my parents is actually not german :d, 
  yes but that 's what germanic tribes have done all the time . 
  if you had n't moved out you maybe would still be living here being a german or a dane . 
  most likely a german since [ anglia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angeln ) is in germany today . 
  i think most british do n't see their german ancestry . 
  maybe you could just start to call yourself new world island german . 
  i 'd like that . 
  heard of [ that ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c3%bcrttemberg_%28weinbaugebiet%29 ) ? 
  on the other hand the upper rhine valley is one of the warmest regions in germany , that 's for sure . 
  that spot is more like in schwabenl\u00e4ndle . 
  i can confirm it 's pretty sunny here ... in comparison to the big blue something in the mid of germany , 
   all the `` shh '' , '' \u00f6 '' so you think the rest of german speakers do n't have that sounds ? 
   most of us share the pronounciation of the r with our french friends . 
  same as \u00dc and \u00d6 . 
  so for me it 's no wonder we could sometimes sound a bit like french guys . 
  switch on comments for real arabic, 
  everyone can . 
  it 's just a question of will . 
  and yes , it is that easy . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/kaiser_heinrich_vi._im_codex_manesse.jpg ) despicts the banner of holy roman empire which is still in use in germany today as the official national coat of arms . 
  the first usage of the colours schwarz-rot-gold alongside each other was probably a carpet which covered friedrich barbarossas way to his own election ceremony as german king in frankfurt am main in 1152 . 
  in the early 19th century student fraternities , on top the `` urburschenschaft '' , were strongly envolved in movements of liberation from napoleons expansion into germany and fought for the unification of german countries . 
  members of that fraternity who fought against napoleon in the so called l\u00fctzowsches freikorps had worn black uniforms with red tucks and goldencoloured buttons . 
  black-red-yellow got fully common in 1832 at hambacher fest as symbol for freedom , civil right and german unity . 
  edit : whoops , you other guys were faster than me . 
  but i will just leave this here . 
  just like that ... and completion . 
  what ? 
  nationalists are the bad guys . 
  they think their country is the best in the whole world . 
  you can be a patriot without thinking all the rest of the world is crap . 
  i 'm proud to be german and i think every country in the world has reasons to be proud of . 
  not for m\u00fcsli ... healthiest breakfast of all times . 
  noone wants them but they 're already here without anyone noticing them . 
  we will hurt ourselves ( or get hurt ) more in the future if we just let those people do what they want in our countries . 
  it is going to lead to civil wars sooner or later . 
  man , we did n't fight the romans just to leave the saved germanic languages to noneuropeans then !, 
  i proove you wrong : you obviously speak english as well !, 
  there were always people cheering when something happened . 
  that was part of the propaganda . 
  apart from this : how do you know `` they were very pro-hitler '' ? 
   germany invaded the czechs in the first place . 
  it 's not like those people suddenly changed their mind . 
  so they pose a future danger to the security of the czech nation . 
  you 're mixing up the hitler government with random germans who were living there for about 1,000 years . 
  i think that 's what / u spearofthedragon wants to say . 
  is russia even giving a crap about what turkey is saying ? 
  * serious question, 
  i have a philishaver and a packard bell laptop . 
  in exchange i offer you to buy a benz and a couple of crates of beer . 
  yea , good one , 
  nice !, 
  here my current favourites : [ ( weed ) asd ( afrob & samy deluxe ) - tortellini augen / hase ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9d6-_cehnq ) [ ( watching interviews of another rapper ) 3plusss - alles was mich juckt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrgnwqekow ) [ ( record-company-hate ) mauli - nix zu tun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spejzx5po7k ) * added topics, 
  let 's say to some germans . 
  i do n't really know exactly . 
  but i would say it 's mainly caring more for other cultures than for their own one . 
  this again is the aftermath of right and leftwing socialisms we 've had in our country . 
  it 's yes . 
  the answer is yes . 
  did n't you listen ? 
  we already are into north sea .
