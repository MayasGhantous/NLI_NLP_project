  it 's not like the criticism comes from uneducated people . 
  not really , this report does not measure poorness : http://www.tichyseinblick.de/kolumnen/mueller-vogg-gegen-den-strom/armutsbericht-angeblich-gibt-es-in-deutschland-mehr-arme-als-in-tschechien/, 
  quick press the kill switch, 
  yes , but before it was either le pen or fillon with fillon being the likely candidate . 
  now it seems like macron might become president . 
  this is really crazy in france : * first fillon with the employment of his wife * le pen also with employment scandal and now the prosecution because of is pictures both candidates had the highest chance of becoming president before these incidents . 
  the data does not say that the attacks came from the right and is for all attacks . 
   yes , and the german idea after receiving by far the bulk of the yugo refugees was , and stop me if you heard it before , a quota system . 
  did not know this , but obviously is kind of funny . 
   the issue is the same issue that existed during the yugo war , if the migration is going somewhere else , why stop it ? 
  let them through to become someone else 's problem . 
  and that 's why they set up dublin, 
   pretty much puts the burden on border countries . 
  so for north africa italy and the for middle east ... greece . 
  because only they can control their borders and stop immigration .

  [ article about eu security research spending . 
  ] ( http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2017-02/security-technologies-eu-terror-research-fraunhofer )  the eu has spent 3 billion euros to make europe safer , but only companies have profited . 
  few new anti-terrorism technologies have been created . 
  what in fact is very strange is how much attention is given to this fake news story . 
  before the reporting of it being fake i have n't even heard about the story . 
   this time , however , the targets were n't such easy prey and the rumor never really got off the ground . 
  is it really a rumour if it does not spread ? 
  more detail is in the [ pdf ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/n2brop7n28/eurotrack_january_mediarepresentation_website.pdf ), 
  could be anything . 
  but probably political extremism and migrant crimes . 
  would be nice if any dane could add to this poll and give his opinion on the media bias in denmark . 
  because i find this really remarkable . 
  from https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/07/british-press-most-right-wing-europe/, 
  and what is wrong about the article ? 
  it is clearly about europe and european politics . 
  if you do n't want certain political opinions , say so and i will find another subreddit . 
  but this is clear censorship . 
  why are my posts not immediately showing up , when i post them ? 
  am i soft banned or something ? 
  is this a fake comment ? 
  it 's just funny how everything can be labelled fake . 
  on a more serious note , i actually think the current polls show much more a hype and not so much the intention to actually vote for the party . 
  ( but it obviously shows the potential , where the spd could be , if they did everything right in the coming months ), 
  or the claim of ** election ** - hacking . 
  because there is no evidence at all that the election process itself was hacked . 
  and neither did l\u00fcgenpresse, 
  good `` argument '', 
  the word was and still is considered a nazi term . 
  but with refugee crisis and other journalism scandals , the opposition more and more is using this word . 
  with the use of ` fake news ' by journalists , i think it is alright to use words like l\u00fcgenpresse or fake news for them if they misreport or have an obvious bias . 
  l\u00fcgenpresse tries to give you this impression . 
  fact is that the majority supports an [ upper limit for refugees ] ( https://www.merkur.de/politik/umfrage-mehrheit-deutschen-will-obergrenze-fluechtlinge-zr-6753226.html ) . 
  fact is also that critics came from all parties . 
  ( wagenknecht , boris palmer , erika steinbach , christian lindner ), 
  you are all so delusional . 
  russia has not so much power that they can decide the outcome of our elections . 
  maybe they can support and influence an existing movement to some degree . 
  meaning when usa voted trump , a lot of them actually wanted , the things trump said . 
  this can also be seen in the polls , where quite a lot are in favor of the current immigration restrictions . 
  65 percent do n't even know what policy schulz wants, 
  you should not vote the parties that have invited millions of refugees if you do n't want refugees . 
  it 's from yougov ( which in my opinion is very trustworthy ), 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzozbfzftvu ) 17 % yes of course 34 % rather yes 29 % rather not 19 % no way, 
  [ guardian also misquoted an assange interview ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5l3r1v/greenwald_guardian_engaged_in_journalistic_fraud/ ), 
   edit : the bottom line is that the conditions under which people live is more important than their ethnicity in determining the crime rate . 
  migrants/refugees live under different conditions than other residents . 
  tension in crowded refugee shelters , unfamiliarity with local customs , lack of stable employment and housing all may determine a person 's behavior . 
  that 's just guesswork .

  and how could he get to milan ? 
  the book was also released in 1933 . 
  ( so not influenced by the nazi regime ), 
  the movie is actually quite nice . 
  it is very relatable ( about school ) and so you can even watch this with your family . 
  there is also a very famous german movie called `` die feuerzangenbowle '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_feuerzangenbowle_ ( 1944_film ), 
  you did not remove my post . 
  the translation is ok . that 's the way spiegel wrote the short summary . 
  but you are right : he did not express himself in a clear way . 
  the security services monitored anis amri for months . 
  according to spiegel-information the terror suspect was willing to do suicide missions . 
  but for an arrest this was not enough . 
  would be a shame if the german government said that is-fighters do not come to germany as refugees . 
  oh wait , they actually said this : http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-08/islamischer-staat-fluechtlinge-deutschland-bundesregierung also my comment was not sarcastic . 
  i was just telling the truth . 
  the raf was an extreme-left/communist terror group, 
   as if we should blame all germans for the rote armee fraktion . 
  no , only the communists, 
  what do you think how much does this impact germany ? 
  here an german article with a more critical opinion : http://cicero.de/berliner-republik/attacke-in-berlin-offene-grenzen-bewirken-das-gegenteil-von-offenheit, 
  it does n't really mean , that the previous article is false . 
  for me at least it sounds more like the turkish-german school wants to distance itself from what was happening . 
  the article itself says :  the turkish administration of the elite school lisesi denies that . 
  but a email to the 35 german teachers speaks a clear language . 
   `` according to a statement from the turkish school administration , it is now a rule that nothing should be taught about christmas traditions and christmas in the classroom . '', 
  and then  there were intensive discussions between german and turkish teachers : `` german teachers have too much christmas lessons '' `` that is provocative ''  there was no official decree, 
  you can clearly see the phenomenon of avoided crossing . 
  it says in small text that part of ireland 's gdp is because corporations move their daughter companies to ireland and not realized profit adds to ireland 's gdp , while the daughter company does not produce anything in ireland and probably pays very little taxes . 
  gdp state debt ( in % of gdp ) unemployment rate education spending ( in % of gdp ) gini coefficient gross fixed capital formation stock indices, 
   - but has no papers so authorities ca n't actually deport him ca n't or wo n't ? 
   land of the free luckily till now i never had any problems driving my diesel car with a red planket into any city . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with it , but if it 's against any rule i will remove it .
