german doctors working in switzerland is a thing , too , from what i 've read . 
  edit : plus all the stories about eastern-european brain drain for example, 
   just like some polish educated people washing dishes in uk . 
  the hypocracy regarding this topic seems to be a global mega-trend . 
  all right , will give it a try there . 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://de.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5a7uys/is_halloween_a_thing_in_your_country/ ) is the link to the according thread in askeurope . 
   western countries never bully and oppress capitalist nations do this and nowadays russia is one of them . 
  at least western countries treat their own people way better than russia . 
  by far not good enough at all , but it 's still an easy competition to win , if you bring up russia as the the other example . 
  you know what ... 
  i miss the days when russia seemed to do better in certain areas . 
  it used to be an incentive for western leaders to prove to westeners that capitalism was the better alternative . 
  but putin-russia is capitalism while at the same time pretending to be an alternative , which it is not . 
  it has just become a crappier version of it . 
   it should aim to perform significantly better than the uk because that would be beneficial for europeans of course the eu should be beneficial for europeans . 
  that 's an implicit premise , as well as it is the conclusion of a good state of the union . 
  self-preservation seems to be a dubious concept to you , but it is not an evil thing per se . 
  demonstrating ones value neither . 
  you could also say that by being beneficial to europeans the eu demonstrates the advantages of a membership . 
   a mutually beneficial deal there is nothing wrong about a mutually beneficial deal . 
  but i believe the best deal must be the one you decided to opt out of . 
   start doing well have you even read my comment before you ` replied ' ? 
   the eu should do everything in its power to hamstring our economic success so that its numbers are better no . 
  the eu should do everything in its power to perform significantly better than the uk in order to demonstrate the advantages of a membership . 
  well , i have to admit that you are correct . 
  i wish the uk citizens the very best and progress in every way . 
  what has been done to greece is a shame and such things ca n't be in the interest of the union . 
   not the welfare of european/uk citizens the welfare of the eu citizens is what the eu should care about . 
  the uk citizens welfare is not the eu 's task anymore . 
  let me put it like that . . 
  instead of actively punishing the uk , it would be very vital to the eu that it considerably outpaces the uk . 
   to do so is to reveal yourself as an irresponsible idiot to not act in your own interest is what reveals you as an irresponsible * person * . 
  look at russia . 
  we have sanctioned them , because it had to happen . 
  not doing it would have been the irresponsible thing . 
   brexit will likely cause enough damage by itself . 
  i believe so too . 
  nobody ** wants ** this to happen , but it has to happen . 
  this way or the other . 
  edit : i do n't endorse any political actions that harm the citizens quality of life . 
  i 'm really against that actually . 
  but like i wrote in a comment above . . 
  instead of actively punishing the uk , it is in the very vital interest of the eu to considerably outpace the uk in the years to come . 
   there must be a price , there must be a threat it 's the crude logic of power . 
  he means other nations must see that it has no advantages to leave the union . 
  maybe a minister from a moral superpower like sweden would have worded it more delicate , but that is what has to happen now . 
  now the first time i heard about them . 
  just checked out their magazine ` bahamas ' . 
  it 's wild . 
  first article i browse could almost be an article from right wing newspaper ` junge freiheit ' . 
  the horseshoe theory might not be complete bs . 
  but he 's unhappy = . . (, 
  ` respect democracy . ', 
  you 're right . 
  though one could argue that the law that states the referendum is non-binding has been implemented by democratically elected representatives . 
   piggyback my thoughts on this i believe one reason for these developements is that one of capitalism 's dogmas - namely that ` competition is good for business ' - paradoxically does n't apply to capitalism itself anymore since the the ` spectre of communism ' disappeared together with the 80ies . 
  there is no urgent need any more to prove to the votership - for example by paying decent wages - that capitalism was the better alternative . 
  i see . 
  you prefer to overread my irony . 
  well , have n't you read the * direct quote * by sheldon s. wolin yet ? 
  former us vice-president and haliburton chairman dick cheney would be an example . 
  do you expect me to quote his confession ? 
  i can quote princeton university 's sheldon s. wolin though :   not coincidentally , generals who later join corporations and corporate executives who take a turn in government have , along with party officials , regularly been charged with corrupt practices . 
  corporate power depends on the state in innumerable ways . 
  for contracts , subsidies , protection ; for promoting opportunities at home and abroad . 
  beginning in the last quarter and state power began to develop beyond one of reciprocal favors or of a revolving door between corporate headquarters and military headquarters . 
  an important fact of contemporary politics is that , while the scope of government regulatory authority has receded , corporate power has increasingly assumed governmental funtions and  services , many of which had previously been deemed the special preserve of state power . 
  corporate expansion extends to military functions , a province once jealously guarded as a  state prerogative . 
  to the extend that corporation and state are now indissolubly connected , `` privatization '' becomes normal and state action in defiance of corporate wishes the aberration . 
  ( managed democracy and the specter of inverted totalitarianism , p. 135 , 136 ), 
  it 's anything , but bad news for arms companies . 
  i 'm quite confident their people have something to say in the capitals of the world and are fervent supporters of `` bringing democracy to the world '' . 
  i said ' ** kind ** of quoting ' . 
   who are these people that he 's quoting ? 
  arms companies ' ceos and lobbyists would be my suggestion . 
  he 's kind of quoting insane people who speak through their actions . 
  edit : not just talking about us-americans here . 
  but not excluding them either . 
  you might have a point here . 
  tough it 's not any russian building . 
  it would be a bold move . 
  maybe no cuba-crisis , but insane enough , in order to think twice who to blame, 
  it is n't, 
  the original european union ( german : europ\u00e4ische union ) was an antifascist resistance group during germany 's nazi era . 
  the berlin-based resistance group was founded in 1939 . 
  [ wiki-link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_\\ ( resistance_group \\ ) ), 
  is it actually true that your first settlers were british prisoners ? 
  yes . 
  me , too . 
  will be interesting though . 
  merkel ? 
  gabriel ? 
  who knows ... polling agency emnid says cdu/csu 32 % , spd 23 % , afd 14 % , gr\u00fcne 11 % , fdp 6 % , linke 9 % , others 5 % at the moment . 
  quick !, 
  let 's somehow create a xenophobic atmosphere and divide protest votership !, 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  youtube-comment says it 's a tradition among students in sweden . 
  it might catch on , but it 's maybe fair to pay the swedes dues for coming up with this . 
  or to blame them for it : ) when i still had a car and was drinving alone i sometimes used to scream at the top of my lungs , on the highway or so , not inner-city housing areas . 
  so this subreddit is about humans who pretend to be robots pretending to be humans,
