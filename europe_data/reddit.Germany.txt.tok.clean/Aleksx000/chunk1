alright then, 
  that is kind of scary . 
  and it sounds like a waste of time . 
  hahahahahaha , you screenshotted that ? 
  i changed it before writing the comment though . 
  weird . 
  not quite :p, 
  do n't question the grorious reader or ban from / r/bestkorea . 
  no no no , you guys dont deny the holocaust . 
  you douchebags just blame it on us :p, 
  is / r/serbia a ` liberal ' place ? 
  i saw the face of tesla and a map including kosovo when being on there one time and i was like `` nope , serb nationalist shitpile , i am outta here '' . 
   as the court has concluded , he 's not innocent and thats the problem . 
  remember that dude who was put in prison for 30 years because of shit a 12-year-old kid made up ? 
  that guy lost 30 years of his life , but not his life itself . 
  that is at least some sort of damage reduction . 
  the court concluded that he was not innocent . 
  had they put him on death row , he would have been executed for a crime he did not commit . 
  now , i do not put in doubt the guilt of breivik . 
  but the rules have to apply to everybody . 
  it is a never ending argument really . 
  one the two of us will probably not solve . 
  but thanks for your input , different opinions are always insightful . 
  the name `` dieselgate '' is sadly not the worst thing about this entire story . 
  to anybody not reading the article : this is not about germany taking in too few refugees , but about the threat of terror . 
  and what are you doing here if you did not read the article yet ? 
  go read the article , god dammit . 
  i always hear this argument from people proposing the death penalty . 
  yes , it would save money , time and reduce risk of him escaping if we just killed him . 
  but the risk of the death penalty hitting an innocent ( he is not , granted ) is big enough to justify taxpayer funds paying for prisoners . 
  quite the radical theory , radical_theorist . 
  but is it `` your '' land ? 
  i mean , the republic of ireland is so deeply connected with the catholic faith that any irish republican nationalism or territorial revanchism has to be connected with religion , right ? 
   kotleba wo n't exterminate gypsies . 
  thats like saying `` yeah , i am a great cab driver . 
  by the way , i do n't kill kitties . '', 
  what i am saying is : very suspicious . 
  -- whatever the case , nazis want to bring order , sure . 
  but letting nazi paramilitary forces make your public dealings is fucking insane . 
  we germans have already learned that lesson in 1928 , slovakia is currently very similar to early 1930s germany in many ways . 
  at least your version of hitler will not have the power ours had . 
  wow , ireland sure is fucking hardcore about its religion . 
  well , you seem to still fit the category , even if more restricted . 
  sure that . 
  iz fine , jokes are still fairly unexplored over here . 
  happy independence day !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ostgebiete ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ours ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ forget, 
  damn italians , i tell you . 
  whoever allies these guys is a fool . 
  no , gingrich . 
  go home . 
  the scale is right there . 
  what you on about ? 
  ( explanation : `` b '' is `` bialystok '' here . ), 
  dont let us down , france !, 
  you are like our only major friend left that we can count on . 
  ^ ^ someone ^ ^ hold ^ ^ me , ^ ^ putin ^ ^ is ^ ^ coming . 
   that 's why i love germans . 
  they dont go for bullshit . 
  but if we do , we do . 
  [ go hard or go home . 
  ] ( http://www.secondworldwarhistory.com/imgs/maps/german-invasion-of-poland.jpg ), 
  we got your back , brotha . 
  ... maybe . 
  sounds good . 
  i considered explosives though , that lowers survival chances . 
  that 's actually what i am getting at . 
  joining the eu would be a great thing for turkey . 
  you guys just would have to play by the rules , so do n't blame obama or europe for rallying against turkey . 
  conflict with ankara earns europe and the united states exactly 0 . 
  lets invite putin and erdogan to dinner with le pen , wilders , petry , farage and all the other fools . 
  eh , we will put that one on hold for now . 
  wilder was born in the wrong germanic country and 80 years too late . 
  i will just stand over here together with the netherlands . 
  the netherlands has a bigger economy than turkey after all . 
  if you truly believe that , you are delusional . 
  we gave turkey so many chances . 
  your government wants to reap the economic benefits of the eu , but refuses to act like a european democracy should . 
  turkey is neither european nor democratic . 
  that 's just how it is . 
  in the future , it is also day 1 of the year 1 of orange . 
  yes , they are . 
  we can probably also purchase a few new ones , no objections . 
  but i do n't want my taxes to be wasted on a stupid race to mars or something like this . 
  let the chinese have it if they desire it so much . 
  oh , i do value it as well . 
  it just holds absolutely no benefit for the average taxpayer and to claim otherwise is enthusiastic at best and delusional at worst . 
  india also has a super efficient budget . 
  if they wasted money like esa and nasa do , they would not be as successful . 
  well , we clearly are n't . 
  or how else do you explain the status quo ? 
  in all honesty , space exploration is a luxury . 
  sure , we could go to mars . 
  but we could also fight poverty . 
  we will take hungary with us , thank you very much . 
  if we got ta go , let 's do the world one last service :p, 
  my thoughts exactly - what else would they say ? 
  we have arrived at the point where conservative supporters of democracy have to specify they do n't like putin . 
  let 's just go home , folks . 
  this political stuff is all bullshit .
