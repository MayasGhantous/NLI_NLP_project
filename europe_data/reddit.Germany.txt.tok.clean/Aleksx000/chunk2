  wait , good news in 2016 ? 
  i do n't buy it . 
  oh , hollande will be gone alright . 
  just who replaces him makes me anxious . 
  and a more nazi version of it . 
  perfect for / r/the _ donald users . 
  sounds delizi\u00f6s !, 
  this is not what `` radical '' means in a religious context . 
  gr8 b8 btw, 
  can confirm . 
  passive aggressiveness is for the inefficient . 
   he needs the people to be happy and like him , despite him being a `` dictator '' . 
  that is honestly true for most dictators . 
  you either go the `` friendly uncle strongman '' route or you go the `` if you oppose me , i shoot you and your family and your cat and the family of your cat '' route . 
  at least the dutch are able to properly elect their politicians . 
  take notes , austria . 
  great , even more nutjobs . 
  and i thought having the british was enough already . 
  ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ brits ^ ^ luv ^ ^ you, 
  right . 
  my bad . 
  yes , it has . 
  it is a csto member . 
  still , it 's europe . 
  so we give it a pass . 
  germany : can not confirm , most polish people doing our dirty work for way too little are nice . 
  you dont make the best of baguette if you dont overthrow the government here and there . 
  go ahead , old faithful ally always following us into world wars that end up destroying you one way or the other . 
  you have permission from the vaterland . 
  thats what we call efficiency , boys . 
  damn right . 
  god bless the two round system - imagine if an asshole won by like a 0.1 % margin . 
  or by not winning in the first place . 
  * looks across the ... * alright i 'll stop, 
  good points certainly . 
  and we are not paying for the 30,000 troops to leave . 
  i would love an explanation by american armchair geo strategists why these are here in the first place if the us does n't profit from the situation . 
  yeah , the governments of poland and hungary are really unpleasant to deal with in their european political stances . 
  excellent reform . 
  imagine if a head of state could n't act because the parliament is of another party . 
  * looks across the pond *, 
  the man loves his holograms . 
  eestis only look north , they have no time for southerners . 
  when a russian citizen is shocked that your country is not progressive , you know you fucked up . 
  yeah , when i got to the part with the nice people , i cringed a bit . 
  once hell freezes over . 
  because serbia is a beautiful country with a fascinating culture , wonderful landmarks , an economy with many opportunities and nice people all around . 
  we did it , reddit . 
  you poor , poor victim . 
  too late , muhahahahaha, 
   ieren absolut widerw\u00e4rtig, 
  you act like britain spoke in a big unified `` accent '' , which it clearly doesnt . 
  i view bbc/oxford english as the `` real one '' , but that doesnt change that virtually no one in britain actually speaks that variant 100 % . 
  these levels of german skills identify you as an inhabitant of saxony . 
  alright , that 's it . 
  hans , get the panzers . 
  highest quality shitposting, 
  * swedish citizen viciously burns turk , more at 10 *, 
  to be fair , english with a thick british accent might as well be french . 
  i 'll understand the same amount . 
  is good username . 
  no , is russia . 
  is russia all the way down . 
  russia is everybody 's larger brother , silly xaxaxa, 
  [ when your quality is off the charts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3alwkeseys ), 
  in the purge , they do n't love one another the rest of the year . 
  hence you guys do n't have to hate one another for the joke to work . 
  welp , now it definitely does n't . 
  the purge is basically `` one day that really sucks '' . 
  and on the contrary , a friendship day is `` one day that 's really awesome '' . 
  no other implications were made . 
  okay , now that i think about it , it was n't that funny . 
  you still did n't get his joke , did you ? 
  they are also our homeboys . 
  hands off . 
  or munasocs . 
  * psh , i could not possibly be bothered to bother somebody about this , old chap . 
  username checks out partially . 
  and because `` catalan '' is generally reserved for the language of the region , catalonian as an adjective for non liguistic matters makes even more sense . 
  kind of like arab , arabic and arabian all have different meanings for the sake of clarity . 
  psh , * northerners *, 
  you 're proving my point . 
  you 're making yourself look like a complete moron . 
  swallow your pride and give it a rest , please . 
   vnsfw just go for nsfl on that one . 
  sure , innocents getting killed in terrorist attacks is `` kinda fair '' . 
  a greek defending merkel is interesting . 
  an spd government might be inclined to not austerise your nation to death anymore . 
  are n't your pure foods hamburgers ? 
  you guys are a nuclear nato power . 
  we normies count on you to have us with us in order to keep putin at bay . 
  why do all lefties love putin ? 
  he is a right wing autocrat . 
  edit : to clarify , i meant left wing politicians , not left wing voters . 
  melenchon is not alone in his behaviour . 
  i just checked the map you mentioned ; the portuguese possessions were at least properly marked . 
  so that 's not the worst . 
  god dammit , paywall . 
  hurt national pride and an incorrect approach does not make incorrect approaches correct . 
  personal unions are not national unions though .
