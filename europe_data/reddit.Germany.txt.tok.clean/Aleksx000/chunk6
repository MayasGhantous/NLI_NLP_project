  usa wants its aircraft carriers , bombers and drones everywhere . 
  usa wants to contain russia [ not for the sake of europe , but for the sake of the usa ] . 
  europe wont give the usa airfields and ports for free . 
  and nato - an american-led , american-founded , american-conceptualized military pact - has administrative costs that are divided after economic strength among the member states . 
  the usa set the terms and now its cheetoface president is crying because he doesnt go to security briefings and doesnt know what nato is even there for . 
  at least mr mattis and even mr pence seem to at least know what they talk about - so i still have hope that the united states , a great nation even though its leader is an idiot and it has american people like you that are idiots , is not yet lost . 
  but now i dared to criticize your orange-painted seventy-year-old wannabe tyrant . 
  come on , call me a cuck and masturbate at your own moral superiority to us yuropoors . 
  now go back to td and cry about leftist safespaces . 
  * they suck at football . 
  ^ ^ 1966 ^ ^ cheaters ^ ^ never ^ ^ forget ^ ^ wembley ^ ^ goal ^ ^ not ^ ^ legit * they suck at cuisine . 
  * they suck at dentists . 
  * they suck at acting like they 're european and have a north america fetish . 
  * silly accents . 
  i love britain < 3 edit : people seem to be taking me serious here :( the only thing that was actually serious was the last point , come on britain , love me . 
  not enough \u00dcs if you ask me . 
  s\u00fcc\u00fck \u00fckm\u00fck there we go , straight to istanbul with that one . 
  i for one welcome our slavic germans . 
  now work low-quality job at minimum wage . 
  2010 was painful to watch as well . 
  i really wanted the netherlands to win because i was salty at spain . 
  i do n't believe that direct democracy is the saint and solution its supporters make it out to be . 
  the * popular opinion * is an ever-changing gullible force , easily manipulated by foreign influence and importantly short-sighted , with little idea of how an economy or a foreign policy works . 
  i am sure that you 're a politically interested person i would love to have a debate and a direct democratic vote with , klapaucjusz , but that fat dude living next to me who rants on about how the jews destroy germany and who gets drunk during football matches and ruins my afternoons ? 
  i do n't want him to have the same power in policy making as the two of us have . 
  he needs to be restricted . 
  and thus i have to bite the bullet and consider if it is not better if the two of us have little influence in direct policy making either . 
  i am opposed to a great increase in terms of direct democracy . 
  get it together :'(, 
  good . 
  we do n't even need someone who loves the eu , but someone that is not an idiot would be appreciated . 
  everytime an american brings that up , i want to call their bluff . 
  the united states is in this seemingly unfavorable relationship because it grants them political influence and a form of military hegemony . 
  i do n't believe in a second that a single us dollar is spent out of friendliness towards europe . 
  this is stone cold calculated diplomatic imperialism on the part of the united states and , at least from that perspective , it is worth every dollar . 
  but if you guys want to get your military bases out of europe and stop bombing the afghans from your bases at ramstein , you will not hear me complaining . 
  there might be a point to be made to associate him with the libertarian party rather than the democratic party in an american model . 
  well , without the whole `` lets give everybody and their mom a shotgun '' thingy , but there are bound to be some inaccuracies i guess . 
  sorry love , you still wo n't be chancellor . 
  accurate when talking about paradox interactive . 
  i think cats primarily did come , still come and always will come for that italian food of yours . 
  brits are all like : [ we soon 'll have the totally * cough cough * best king in the world . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles,_prince_of_wales ), 
  damn , 1974 ; we destroyed your team harder than we destroyed rotterdam . 
  but real talk for a second , you guys really need to learn how to win world cup finals . 
  while you do raise a valid point , our bundeswehr is in a worrying state . 
  we have one of the most jingoistic ministers of defense in a long time , but even empress uschi does n't seem to find the money to fix our helicopters . 
  time to stop with the schwarze null bullshit and at least acquire an army that can do its job . 
  your trolling needs work . 
  that appears like a regrettably narrow interpretation ; which is something you seem to accuse americans of . 
  people disregarding nuance and detail is not an american problem ; it also seems to be with you . 
   \u2105 that 's a pretty cool % sign . 
  / r/conspiracy time : the republicans have already chosen that trump is getting dumped down the line , but they have to make pence look like a reasonable and unifying politician first , so pence walks around telling everybody they 're awesome and america is gon na stay loyal . 
  who am i kidding , / r/conspiracy would never contain something not sucking trump 's dick . 
  yo , do n't think your hooligans are special . 
  neo nazis really like being drunk and shouting at people during football matches . 
  not only during football matches i guess . 
  damn , poor ndp . 
  these numbers seem odd to be honest . 
  so , they got 42 % of the people saying spd in the recent polls ? 
  interesting . 
  well , i guess . 
  that 's fair i suppose . 
  / r/asagerman, 
  your flag flair makes this appear like a comment from the 1760s . 
  * do n't worry , the russians will come to you . 
  no need to go there . 
  * - ukrainian travel advice . 
  d00d , you guys could n't even hold onto luxembourg . 
  anschluss indeed . 
  i think no one will claim he is n't entitled to his opinion . 
  however , calling his opinion stupid is generously re-interpreted as `` free speech silencing '' by his and other reactionary political supporters . 
  it is the most effective right-wingers try to shut down discussion in a place not completely taken over by them ( for example / r/europe ) from what i 've seen ; snowflake around and cry about unfair reports and the evil regressive leftists trying to silence their voices in order to avoid defending their positions . 
  so , is this the kick-off to `` dutch , german and french right-wingers saying stupid shit to get in the news '' ? 
  let 's see if the media handles this well . 
  [ my homeboy , tintin ] ( https://youtu.be/0tumvwcbm-g?t=7m54s ), 
  https://i.gyazo.com/1a3240d31891006e658e6b2ab47d9eb9.png thanks , wikipedia, 
  also : which version of the flag is better ? 
  with blue triangle or without ? 
   you 'll get undereducated or with strongly foreign values not quite correct . 
  foreign values , sure , but undereducated probably not . 
  these people are the ones who can afford the trip , meaning that they are the ones their home countries would need to rebuild once the local conflicts are over . 
  this means that europe is , all humanitarian problems aside , worsening the possibility for the refuge problem to stop with every refugee it accepts . 
  which is of course quite the dilemma . 
  the very poorest are not able to even flee in the first place or they are only there where their feet can take them ; certainly not sweden though . 
  also , does n't really cover the fact that `` msm '' includes like a hundred outlets , while breitbart is breitbart . 
  there are lot of different agendas behind the msm , and it is worrying that reddit users appear to start thinking the msm works as one united monolith . 
  i think `` ninchen '' , that being a cutification of nina . 
  i think in german it often is translated to `` nina '' . 
  basically , we found an actual name that we could actually pronounce rather than that dutch thingy with way too many consonants . 
  does n't istanbul has like as many inhabitants as the entirety of greece ? 
  it would be the best war , delicious , very great , everyone says so . 
  in my opinion , this attitude expresses a future attitude ; and considering that german is more liberal on `` wrong '' tenses than english is , i interpreted it as a future-directed present tense rather than a straight up simple present . 
  i guess it is debatable on a grammatical level . 
  also `` who is jewish , i decide . '', 
  sounds pretty odd in english . 
  i guess `` i decide who is jewish '' works better , but one might as well keep g\u00f6ring 's weird grammatical order . 
  then again , while you 're at it , you might as well correct `` jewish '' to `` a jew '' which would be more accurate . 
  then again , english is more prone to use adjectives in such a context while german might as well use a noun without having to construct a few filler words around it . 
  ( `` wer jude ist '' ; as compared to `` who is a jew '' ) .
