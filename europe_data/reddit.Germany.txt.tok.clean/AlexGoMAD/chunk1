they have a working asylum system , do n't ferry service illegals into their society but detain those arriving illegally by boats . 
  by arming the so called `` moderates '' , which as we know are radical fundamentalists as well in order to overthrow assad . 
   at least this time the man who committed this act lived . 
  the one in berlin ( christmas market ) did too and escaped to italy where he was shot . 
   i guess to not show up in search results/scrapers . 
  it already appears in other comments in this thread at least 10 times . 
  he 's a religious nut job living in sweden , i mean look at his comments : * https://www.reddit.com/r/isis/comments/5z29k9/if_music_is_forbidden_by_isis_why_does_isis_use/dflm8ut/ * https://www.reddit.com/user/weeniebusterxd?count=100&amp;after=t1_dfktqoz, 
   or are we using migrants and refugees interchangeably now ? 
  i guess it 's about time people realize that the percentage of real refugees between all the aggressive fighting age male migrants swarming in is abysmal . 
  or at least i 'd hope so . 
  give it another 10 years and there 'll be free travel to the eu for the entire world . 
  oh wait , there pretty much already is since we 're not protecting our borders . 
  translation :  nullifying all child marriages under 16 is wrong . 
  it would be better to look at every isolated incident . 
  so that young women do n't remain objects without a will of their own . 
  germany has been obsessed with ` einzelfall ' aka ` isolated incidents ' in the past 2 years . 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
   sorry about that . 
  good thing i 'm from germany . 
  yes . 
  die zeit is left-liberal . 
  it 's a `` leitmedium '' . 
  because most `` reasonably fit '' people will know what i 'm talking about . 
  a standard olympic barbell with 2 plates on each side is 225lb . 
  a plate weighs 45lb ( 20.4 kg ) , so does the barbell . 
  so total 4 plates + 1 barbell = 5 * 45lb = 225lb , a women that trains can lift this but maybe not be able to carry it . 
  granted , a flat coin will be harder to grab than a barbell but two guys will do . 
  was just pointing out that it 's really easy for two regular gym goers to lift and carry 100 kg together ( conversion factor kg -  lb is 2.2 ) . 
  p. s. : just got back from gym . 
  jesus christ man , being called a `` nazi burgerboo '' already , the hate here is real !, 
  sure it sounds like a lot but 220lb really is n't that heavy . 
  two reasonably fit guys can easily lift and carry it for short distances without much difficulty . 
  though they probably just put it on a small board with wheels and rolled it . 
  i wonder how they got in there undetected ... 
  does the space station have a selfie-stick ?

   the terrorists win when european culture is destroyed i can tell you for certain , that u/trolleybusisreal does not care about european culture . 
  no , we must not suppress our reactions to these atrocities . 
  this is the left-wing-extremist-brain-gymnastics way to carry on and pretend that everything is okay the way it is because we 're getting more colorful . 
  it 's also the reaction of a broken man who has lost all hope and knows he will soon die . 
  it 's a fucking stupid way to go about it because the reactions are not `` disproportionate '' . 
  it could hit you or me , any day of the week . 
  the threat since september 2015 is very real and the reason france has been in a state of emergency ever since november 2015 . 
  we , in the eu have to start protecting our own citizens and drop the moral superiority retardation that 's digging our own graves . 
  but hey , i was told by you guys that germany is safe when saying that i do not feel safe in germany anymore . 
  i was told that there 's 100 things more likely to kill you than terrorism .

  former yugoslavia is very vague . 
  since : * former yugoslavia does n't exist anymore . 
  * former yugoslavia is now 6 or 7 independent countries . 
   [ ... ] story about refugees [ ... ] why do you still call them `` refugees '' ? 
  those are not refugees . 
  it 's better to call them what they are : economic migrants or illegal immigrants . 
  screw political correctness . 
  one day it will bury us alive if we continue down this path .

  one the one side you feminists insist on there being obvious physiological differences between men and women , e.g. 
  men being more suitable for physically demanding work therefore sports leagues ( even chess ) having to be separated between the genders . 
  on the other side you want these obvious physiological differences to be completely overlooked whenever it suits you . 
  you know , men ca n't breast feed . 
  that being said , i know plenty of men who were the ones that took `` time off '' when their child was born and the mother went back to work and they sure as hell are not looked down upon but are rather admired for it . 
  why does the moon appear this big ? 
  any scientific explanation ? 
  i 'll go with 15 \u00d7 10 ^ 1 . 
  going by [ significant figure rules ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/significance_arithmetic ) you display the result rounded to the lowest precision number that was given ( 2.0 has two significant figures ) . 
  so the result would be 15 \u00d7 10 ^ 1 . 
  everyone should have learned this in school at some point , i hope . 
  in languages like c and c++ division of integers and floating point variables/literals yields a float or double , respectively ( depending on the type of the floating point variable or literal ) . 
  ** source : ** * am cs guy . 
  waiting for the first person there to paint their house pink . 
  yes . 
  i will be leaving germany either this or next year . 
  these were my 9th :  i already do n't feel safe in germany anymore but should a left-wing red-red-green coalition be elected into the bundestag next year , then i 'll be fleeing the country the first chance i get . 
    imho , such a coalition has the potential to cause full on civil war . 
  and my 5th :  i 'm a well educated ( msc in cs ) and physically fit male and i do not feel safe in germany anymore since the ansbach bombing which was just a couple of hundred meters away from my doorstep . 
  comments on reddit . 
  i 've personally been physically attacked once and have also had my property damaged ( bike tyre slashed ) by a gang of 3 `` refugees '' who tried to steal my bike when i was inside the bank . 
  yet another time i had to step in to help two guys who were getting mugged by 3 african guys . 
  these days you 're just better off closing your eyes and walking idly by . 
  because nobody is going to step in to help you when shit hits the fan . 
  nobody wants to be labelled a `` racist '' . 
   if you cut out the crossings themselves , then all crime ( from non-violent stuff like theft to the most violent types ) fell . 
  except trucks ploughing through christmas markets , mass rapes like cologne , suicide bombings like in brussels and ansbach and just the daily shootings , stabbings and the occasional beheading of priests went up . 
  keep your eyes closed and pretend everything is okay . 
  tomatoes are going for around 6 $ / kg at my local supermarket ... 
  i mean they 're always more expensive during the winter , but not this much . 
   who cares , most of the ones who arrived at countries that werent france and germany have already leaved to it . 
  excuse me ? 
  i care . 
  this clearly proves their unwillingness to integrate . 
  they flock to germany because they think they are something better and deserve better than us `` infidels '' and precisely because germany is where they get their halal food served on silver platters . 
   no , it does n't . 
  look up the definition . 
  okay , let 's see . 
  the definition for a no-go zone , pretty much , is an area where the authorities have lost control . 
  consequently , when you have areas that the police do n't patrol simply because it 's too dangerous for them due to them constantly being attacked in those areas and when even ambulances are being attacked there as well , then you 're fulfilling the very definition of a no-go zone . 
  and that is the case . 
  therefore you do have no-go zones .
