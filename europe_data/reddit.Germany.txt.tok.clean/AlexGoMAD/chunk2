   to most people from there being on welfare and in social housing is already dream realized compared to what they 've had before . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why they call us germoney . 
  by these metrics george w. bush * will forever stay * more popular than obama . 
  that right there is saying something . 
  nice edit , i guess . 
  will be hard to beat obama on that one !, 
  are you talking on behalf of sa ? 
  because if not , you should learn to read . 
   [ ... ] if they change their mind , stop sponsoring nationalist that try to undermine european unity [ ... ] yeah , let 's continue being friends with saudi arabia and let them sponsor the building of mosques all across europe and let radical imams preach in them . 
  what can possibly go wrong , right ? 
  why ? 
  as a slovenian ( who lives in germany ) i am quite proud and happy for her !, 
  opening the doors and openly inviting everybody and everything without any sort of checks at the border has nothing to do with the right for asylum . 
  no-one has anything against the right for asylum , not even right-wing political parties . 
  but * the almost exclusively male influx we 've seen in europe , * especially from north africa , * has nothing to do with asylum . 
  is the lake currently frozen and you can you just walk over it ? 
  it 's been pretty cold the past two weeks . 
  and yeah , this picture shows the incredible beauty that you 'll find in the julian alps parts of slovenia ( gori\u0161ka and gorenjska ) . 
  there was a store that sold stink bomb ampoules and silly as we were we 'd drop those on the floor on our ride home with the train . 
  those smelled so terrible that everyone would just get up and leave the wagon . 
  turkey turning into just another islamic shithole \u2122 was just a matter of time . 
  what bothers me though is the german government doing its very best to follow suit asap . 
   yeah , for most crime that do n't injure anybody , nobody goes to prison in germany sadly , maybe tax evasion . 
  refusing to pay the german state media fees ( gez ) but specially `` hate-speech '' have got ordinary people into jail before . 
  oh and let 's not forget holocaust denial where a 87 year old grandma was sentenced to jail : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ursula_haverbeck in case of gez you can avoid prison by paying , of course . 
   to be fair , the court never ruled that the arson was legitimate and they were convicted for it . 
  to me it seems like they did exactly that , quote :  to the court , it was simply a rational if overly rambunctious policy critique . 
  the perpetrators were given suspended sentences . 
  the court is justifying their actions and giving them suspended sentences . 
  so in conclusion it seems that muslims can do just about anything in europe and get away with it unscathed . 
  you ca n't even criticize them for their actions without being thrown into prison yourself . 
  i still hope justice will * somehow * be served against them . 
   hello new troll account . 
  are you stalking me ? 
  and just to answer your other comment :  hello my friend . 
  did your previous account get banned ? 
  i have been reading / r/europe regularly for about half a year now . 
  but even longer than that i 've been looking at some bodybuilding subreddits and lately also the front page . 
  i hesitated registering for a long time because i thought the nested tree structure of comments was too clumsy , complicated and the ordering seemingly random and much different compared to the likes of stackexchange or ipb/bb forums and therefore difficult to learn . 
  i realized it 's actually not that difficult , but i 'm still learning . 
  nice attempts to discredit and insult me . 
  i 've seen the behavior you 're displaying in real-life often enough to know your kind . 
   i hope you have a good night . 
  this madness has started just over a year ago and i do n't recognize germany again . 
  things have all changed to the worse . 
  the government has repeatedly admitted that they 've completely lost control and have no idea who or what was allowed into the country during this mass exodus to germany . 
  nobody knows how many million came and we have no idea who they are . 
  turns out this guy was already jailed in italy before . 
  i 'm honestly not surprised their home countries do n't want these kind of people back - they 're not insane . 
  it is however pure insanity how people that ~ ~ lose ~ ~ throw their papers away , while they all have their smartphones with them , are let into the country without any vetting and the authorities keep turning a blind eye to those that have bought fake identities/passports . 
  imagine a german citzien had 2 identities and collected benefits twice . 
  he 'd be behind bars for 10 years and would still have to pay back every cent . 
  but yeah , let 's all jump on the populist merkel bandwagon and shout `` wir schaffen das ! '' . 
  it 's sickening . 
   in theory it could have been tourists as well . 
  you never know . 
  tourists that come to europe for the free money ? 
  we 've already seen these kind of things happen in major german cities . 
  that 's why there were thousands of ( heavily armed ) policemen guarding the area around the cologne cathedral and the train station just so we could have a normal new years eve . 
   that 's why it is important to not jump the gun [ ... ] nobody is jumping the gun . 
  it 's equally important not to close your eyes to things that have happened not so long ago . 
  and how many were injured and maimed for life ? 
  do you think everything is ok once you 're released from hospital after being run down by a truck ? 
  you do n't hear about those , huh . 
  what about the mass rapes perpetrated by the same group of people aka the `` new arrivals '' - is that not a form of terrorism ? 
  i told you to use google . 
   [ ... ] since 100 things are more likly to kill you than terrorism . 
  those 100 things would be ? 
  i do n't drive because i do n't need to . 
  last time i set a foot in a car was in ~ ~ february ~ ~ actually september !, 
  i ride my bicycle , not on the road though but on fahrradwege . 
   i 'm very careful when it comes to crossing roads . 
  oh , and since merkel invited in everyone i started avoiding mingling into masses of people to the point where i think twice about going to large shopping centers when i do n't absolutely need to go there and prefer to buy stuff in smaller stores and i sure as hell do n't visit any major event anymore thanks to merkel . 
   do germany a favor and `` flee '' the country now because we really dont need such useless cowards here . 
  you rather have battle-tested isis fighters in germany . 
   and civil war because of the outcome of a vote in germany ? 
  it 's not the vote itself but the consequences of continued open border and continued unrestricted illegal immigration policy that is easily capable of social unrest and resulting riots ending in a full on civil war . 
  i already do n't feel safe in germany anymore but should a left-wing red-red-green coalition be elected into the bundestag next year , then i 'll be fleeing the country the first chance i get . 
  imho , such a coalition has the potential to cause full on civil war . 
   in fear of a one-in-a-million chance except , the chance is a whole lot higher . 
  since merkel invited in everyone and everything . 
  over 200 people have died in france and hundreds have been injured in the past 1 year alone . 
  france has a population of only 66m . 
  do your math . 
  we 're not even taking into consideration stabbings and rapes . 
  i 'm a well educated ( msc in cs ) and physically fit male and i do not feel safe in germany anymore since the ansbach bombing which was just a couple of hundred meters away from my doorstep . 
  you can say the same about far left wingers . 
  probably even more so . 
  plenty of trustworthy sources . 
  just use google . 
  besides the government has repeatedly admitted that they 've totally lost control and count so that the real number could be a lot higher still . 
   konstanz has a significant far right scene , may be relevant . 
  yeah , muh far right is responsible for iraqi killing clubbers . 
   let 's ban cars , think of the families who lost their loved ones to car accidents !, 
  yeah , let 's compare car accidents , ** which you know are accidents , ** to terrorist attacks and rapes that were committed by refugees , ** which are cold blooded premeditated murder ** against our own citizens and disgusting acts of cowardice against women that their culture taught them to despise and treat like dogs . 
  * edit : taught not thought *, 
   i would argue article 55.c says we have to take in refugees and ca n't deport them to random countries . 
  well , let 's see then ... ** [ un charta , chapter ix , article 55c ] ( http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-ix/ ) **  universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion . 
  article 55 is about equal rights .
