  obviously that 's the best he can come up with . 
  cute how you jump to conclusions . 
  do you think i have german citizenship just because i live and work in germany ? 
  to be honest with you , i would not even accept it as a gift and much less would i do anything for it even though i 'm certainly eligible . 
   men are disposable while women have inherent worth to society . 
  this is n't common knowledge by now ? 
  exactly what i wanted to comment . 
  men are replaceable . 
  especially white men . 
  if you do n't have enough men , just invite in a couple million more . 
  problem solved . 
   no one said it was a `` european country '' , so your example is flawed hurr , durr . 
  maybe you should learn to read . 
   you are arguing litteraly against the constitutional protected human dignity . 
  i am not arguing against anything . 
  do n't put words in my mouth . 
  he said that the rule of law is not insanity . 
  i asked whether nazi laws were not insanity . 
  because they were laws too , you know , and i think at least some of them were surely pretty insane . 
  a law does n't have to be sane to be in effect . 
  there 's still plenty of ridiculously insane laws in place . 
   a better leader tries to get other countries on board to stem the crisis together . 
  how will you stem 1,216,000,000 people , that do not care about us or our way of life , forcefully making their way into europe to be supported by 508,000,000 europeans ? 
  are you going to house , feed and entertain 2 africans ? 
  do n't you realize that the problem is only going to get worse by the day ? 
  there 's a reason those `` other countries '' ** do not ** want to be a part of germany 's moral superpower complex . 
  nazi laws were not insanity then ? 
  i 'm all for it , but i do n't see it happening . 
  they are allowed to roam free within western-europe . 
  if you started containing them , they would start riots and killing innocent people as well as raping even more women . 
  the majority of these people do not share our western values and made their way into europe by force to get all the freebies and handouts . 
  they sure are n't gon na leave without resisting because where they come from they would actually have to work to afford life . 
  a critical mass has long been reached and it 's not going to just disappear . 
  plus the indoctrination going on in schools/media , how they are n't illegal and have every right to be here . 
  wishful thinking . 
  will never happen due to germany 's dark past . 
  just the wording `` concentrate '' and `` camps '' would make everyone here go nuts because muh guilt complex . 
  that 's right , they 're `` hip '' though and i guess some see it as a status symbol . 
  certainly a bit ironic . 
  invaders would win . 
  because what would compassionate humanitarian superpower europe do , other than provide them with free food , free housing , free healthcare , free money , free this and that ? 
  if we do n't finally shoot and set a precedent , europe is lost . 
   when is antifa going to be declared a terrorist organization ? 
  certainly not as long as german state media labels them `` left wing activists '' . 
  make stupid comments , win stupid children . 
  israel enforces conscription for jews as well . 
  currently 2 years for women and 2 years and 8 months for men . 
  heck , even gal gadot served in the idf . 
  so , what , exactly , is your point ? 
  maybe we should invite all russians and chinese as well ? 
  invite the whole world ? 
  would that make you happy ? 
   the only viable solution is to dismantle the ridiculously generous german welfare system ( as well as sweden 's etc ) . 
  yeah , or only make it available to those that have previously paid in to it ( and their children ) . 
  germans have been told , repeatedly , that the `` refugees '' are n't gon na take anything away from them or cause any cuts . 
  welfare should be a privilege that is gained by contributing , and not an entitlement everyone who passes the border magically gets as it is now . 
   none ? 
  none ? 
  do you think the fuel for their ships buys itself ? 
  does it come out of thin air ? 
  while the organization itself might not be making any money , because they know that what they are doing is illegal , they sure as hell pay money to their employees and helpers and certainly not little . 
  this way they can evade the organization getting sued and stuff their own pockets . 
  you know , nobody works for free . 
  you got ta make money , somehow . 
  and they make enough through donations . 
   yeah , no , that 's illegal . 
  imagine you 're driving on the highway and the police stops you and takes your car away . 
  he did n't say to take their boats away . 
  he said to take their permits away . 
  that 's two very different things , and yes , the police can stop you , take your license away and also confiscate the car keys if they find that you 're incapable of driving the car . 
  what does it matter if i 'm a man or a woman ? 
  and why should only a woman have a say about what 's equally the flesh and blood of the man that she conceived the new life with ? 
  it is common sense . 
  but you ca n't see it because you see everything in black and white . 
  it 's just awesome or pure shit , with nothing in between and that 's because you 're so narrow minded . 
  what consequences are you talking about ? 
  ever thought about the consequences of taking an innocent life ? 
  * being `` poor '' is no excuse . 
  there 's government child support you can claim . 
  * also having less money does n't equate to a `` fucked up life '' as you put it and certainly not bad childhood . 
  you know , i was poor too and my childhood was by far the best time of my life . 
  i 've grown up and am an independent , well educated adult with a functioning moral compass . 
  * no-one is forcing women into any dilemmas . 
  abortion should be legal for strictly medical reasons . 
  not for selfishness . 
  ** let me quote my top-level comment : **  i 'm not saying it 's bad in the case when the mother 's life is endangered by continuing pregnancy but doing it out of selfishness , because you do n't want to take responsibility , is just wrong . 
   and lastly , do you really think people will stop having abortions if it 's not provided in safe hospitals ? 
  i certainly know that i would n't have any kind of surgical operation if it was n't provided in safe hospitals . 
  i guess that 's common sense . 
  you 'd think germany would have learned from that time and try not to repeat it . 
  but no , it 's the opposite . 
  they want exactly that . 
  there 's enough high ranking stasi officials , informants and henchmen still in german politics today . 
   not everyone is educated about them . 
  oh please . 
  we live in europe . 
  the `` not educated about contraception '' argument is n't valid and you know it . 
   plus mistakes/accidents happen . 
  there 's still the `` morning after pill '' . 
   let 's take for example two 16 years old [ ... ] punished for life [ ... ] stuck with a baby at that age and ruin 3 lives at once ?
