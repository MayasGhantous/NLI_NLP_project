  at 16 , they sure as hell have parents who ~ ~ will ~ ~ should be glad to become grandparents . 
  unless again , there 's something wrong with them . 
   when they have no place of their own , no job , no savings , no plans to stay together for life ? 
  there 's child support you can receive from the government . 
  so the money argument , again , is a fallacy . 
   maybe the guy took his chance and ran off too . 
  yeah , he 's gon na take off at 16 years old . 
  nice plan . 
  is he gon na hide in the treehouse or what ? 
  you know , there 's always someone in the family who can take care of the kids while the 16 year old is in high school . 
   women have always had abortions , even before the beginning of a pro-choice movement . 
  well , that 's weird , because they do n't seem to have abortions in africa . 
   backstreet abortions endanger the woman 's life . 
  then do n't have those ? 
  there 's something gone horribly wrong when a woman chooses to endanger her life , rather than give birth to the kid that 's developing in her belly and embrace her own flesh and blood , as well as that of her loved one as something beautiful and unique after giving birth . 
  maybe it 's the indoctrination ? 
  acting as if abortion is something good . 
  there 's enough methods of contraception if you do n't want to become parents . 
  who ever had the idea that creating life just to kill it is good ? 
  i 'm not saying it 's bad in the case when the mother 's life is ** endangered ** by continuing pregnancy but doing it out of selfishness , because you do n't want to take responsibility , is just wrong . 
  nothing else than notches in the handle of an outlaw 's gun . 
  not to mention the psychological problems women who 've had abortions get later in life because , in time , there always comes a day when their time will be no more . 
  go play some more wow . 
  so i 'm taking that you look like him , since you claim to `` know '' that his body is obtainable naturally ? 
  but since you do n't and do n't seem to have any steroid experience either , your comment is absolutely useless . 
  all you 're doing is misleading people by making them think they can look like fitness models by just discipline and diet . 
  stop lying to yourself and take a look in the mirror . 
  sure . 
  he 's a soccer player , doing plenty of cardio during his soccer training . 
  yet he has the body of a strength athlete / fitness model . 
  you do n't really get to keep that much upper body muscle mass as a soccer player doing heaps of cardio . 
  i remember seeing some before and after comparison of his transformation that supposedly happened within quite a short time , maybe half a year which is not possible naturally . 
  that and his capped , veiny deltoids are a telltale sign that something 's going on , although they are not that huge they are still suspicious . 
  you 're right , but you forgot all the anabolic steroid , sarm , growth hormone use and all the other lovely methods like blood transfusions to increase athlete endurance . 
  i mean , look at cristiano ronaldo . 
  i 'm baffled he 's still allowed to play . 
  and to all the people saying : `` but most soccer players look like toothpicks '' . 
  lance armstrong was on hgh and steroids while winning the tour de france and he is a toothpick . 
  you do n't have to ` look like you 're on steroids ' to be on steroids . 
  more people than you think are on them . 
  i guarantee you know someone who is on them . 
  that being said , all sports where huge amounts of money is involved are dirty . 
   ** title : ** belgian court finds arab princesses ** guilty of traficking and abusing servants **  ** subtitle : ** a brussels court has ** handed a 15-month suspended prison sentence ** to eight arab princesses . 
  the widow of an abu dhabi sheikh and her seven daughters were found guilty of human trafficking and degrading their servants . 
  suspended prison sentence ( which means no prison at all ) for keeping slaves , not paying them and treating them like trash . 
  appeasement at its finest . 
  way to go . 
  sure , but because muh human rights , what else would be in the database apart from their fake name and fake age ? 
  it 's not hard for them to get another identity , they just have to use their imagination . 
  [ anis amri who drove the truck into the berlin christmas market had at least 14 identities . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-officials-anis-amri-used-at-least-14-identities/a-37029856 ), 
  it 's more than that . 
  it 's basically 3 % , even with the amount returned and that 's just 2012 to 2016 according to that stat . 
  so basically 30 swedes are supporting 1 refugee/illegal if not even worse . 
  it basically already is a shitshow , although people who have an agenda to push want to make you believe otherwise . 
  the country is basically lost . 
  how would you flag them ? 
  most of them have thrown their papers away or have hidden them as they entered europe illegally . 
  even germany does n't have a fingerprint database of them . 
  they 've been waved in by the thousands each day . 
  [ no it 's not . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) see where this is going ? 
  you did n't refute anything . 
   i see the afd voters are out in force . 
  oh please , way to start your comment and show what kind of ignorant bigot you are . 
   funny how much you all care about not letting refugees in , but do n't give a shit that we 've been bombing the fuck out of their country for 15 years , we ? 
  germany is n't bombing anyone . 
   look at all the french and british flags and colors people posted on facebook and brandenburger tor ... 
  but where was the afghan flag after 70 people were killed by a suicide bomber ?? 
  where was the russian flag when a bomb in the saint petersburg metro killed 15 and wounded at least 45 others ? 
  it 's been said that they only light the brandenburger tor when a partner city has been hit . 
   and afghanistan is in the bottom 20 in terms of gdp per capita . 
  afghanistan is ** not ** in the bottom 20 in terms of gdp per capita . 
  and even if it was . 
  so what ? 
  that 's not a valid reason to be granting someone asylum . 
  i 'd much rather live in australia or usa as well , which both have a higher gdp per capita than germany does . 
  so try again please or go push your agenda elsewhere . 
   and sure yes , tv and books are great . 
  but not all refugees have access to that . 
  every refugee has access to the city library ( stadtb\u00fccherei ) in germany . 
  so do n't come up with that . 
   personal interaction is also a great way to learn , but for that they need contact with the native speaking population . 
  and that 's fucking hard to come by if you stick them all in the same houses and same courses at school , what are they supposed to do ? 
  why do n't you take one to your home or maybe two or three ? 
  seems like that 's what your heart is telling you to do . 
  what 's stopping you from doing that ? 
  what are your concerns ? 
  well ? 
   ah yes , i forgot how safe it is in countries like egypt , libya , syria , afghanistan etc etc. 
  do you want to take in the whole of `` egypt , libya , syria , afghanistan etc. 
  etc. '' ? 
  because that 's what you make it sound like . 
   like i said , please educate yourself . 
  you do n't appear to what what the definition of a refugee is , who can be considered a refugee , the motivations of those people for leaving etc. 
  no , it 's you who does n't know the definition of a refugee . 
  i mean you 're spewing stuff like this :  there 's a very good reason why most are male which people like to conveniently forget . 
  ** most of them have to make a journey of 1000 's of miles , ** across many countries and they across many people . 
  they most certainly do n't have to do that , because that 's pretty much the definition of economic migration . 
  i asked you how many have been deported , not how many have been rejected .
