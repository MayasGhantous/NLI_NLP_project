i think [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughtrumpspam/comments/5bb1m2/this_is_currently_going_through_twitter_about/d9n7e30/ ) sums up my thoughts about his ideology . 
  other than that i think he 's a coward , stupid , unable to control himself , corrupt , narcissistic , racist , sexist , misogynistic a horrendous father and husband and just a general shit human being . 
  his supporters will from now on be unable to deflect his horrendous flaws on hillary clinton . 
  he has to prove his worth on his own . 
  that does n't mean i do n't want him to be a good president . 
  if he turns out to be better than expected i 'd gladly accept it . 
  oh and hell yeah , muslims , lgbt , poc , mexican-americans all will feel unsafe . 
  their country essentially told them it either hates them , or does n't care about them . 
  imo we germans have something similar . 
  for 100s of years it was said that french and germans were enemies by inheritance . 
  then germany and france managed to become friends in the span of not even 2-3 decades years after the largest war in history saw them both fighting each other . 
  10 in germany . 
  i guess you 're american ? 
  there is no reason not to travel right now . 
  in germany , which took the bulk of the immigrants , the crime did n't really rise at all ( 0,1 % https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/straftaten-auslaender-erklaerung-101.html ) . 
  the actual crime rate did increase , but only due to people scamming the asylum system . 
  crimes impacting you as a tourist did n't change at all . 
  most of the organized crime and stuff has always come from eastern european gangs . 
  [ if in doubt , look at the last 2 paragraphs here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/52kvpm/serious_germans_of_reddit_is_the_immigration/d7l3h87 ), 
  how do we change forever if we keep them in camps and get them back when the scw has ended ? 
  haha 30million ? 
  ? you 're a polemic idiot . 
  good idea, 
  tbh , i 'd let them in but firstly put them into larger , more centralized refugee camps if the shelters are full . 
  countries like turkey and lebanon have millions of refugees , it is economically possible to take them . 
  ** i think most confusion comes frome the difference between ** `` refugees '' ** and ** `` immigrants '' ** . 
  if the situation in the middle east and africa does n't better then refugees will ** de facto ** become immigrants . 
  ** i think it 's germanys historic responsibility to give people that are in danger asylum . 
  jewish refugees have been turned away prior to wwii and since 1945 germany always tried to be the country that learned the most from it 's history in these kinds of matters . 
  ** they ** need ** to be expelled asap ( ansbach ) if they : a. 
  do major and medium crimes like physical attacks and stuff ( cologne attacks ) b : incite hate / otherwise break our values . 
  ** * now the big thing * : i do n't give a damn wether their culture is n't `` compatible '' with ours . 
  most germans that say that * have no idea wich `` german '' culture they 're talking about * ( besides beer obviusly ) . 
  ** but ** : they need to give up parts of their culture when this culture/religion conflicts with modern western/european values . 
  islam is as compatible with modern values as christianity or hinduism is . 
  all of the 3 opressed people and were used to legitimize wars and murder . 
  refugees need to be / identify themselves as german refugees first , ** before ** being muslim . 
  this is not a question of religion , but modernization . they are dependant on us not the other way around , if their world view is conflicting with ours they either need to go or embrace our values . 
  ** 6 ** i do n't think purely economic refugees should be let in . 
  they take away place from `` real '' refugees while simultaneously performing a bran drain on the countries they come from . 
  it 's better to help these countries than to help these perople ** 7 . 
  ** unfortunately , without solving the problems in the middle east there 's no way this crisis can end . 
  ** tldr ** ; take every accepted one in , throw them in centralized camps like in turkey if necessary . 
  nobody dies because he is denied asylum . 
  purely economic refugees should n't be given asylum . 
  if they do n't embrace our values or commit crimes they need to be expelled . 
   most speakers of finnish are also immigrants, 
  in other words : the sky is blue . 
  lol i love the globalization and modernization hate . 
  that shit wo n't go away guys . 
  free trade is ultimately a good thing . 
  the problem is , while it affects the general populace and the gdp positively , it affects the already disadvantaged part of the population ( blue-collar , rural & uneducated ) in an disproportionally harsh way . 
  but the solution ca n't be to overturn free trade and return to protectionism . 
  for the last century uk was unable to feed it 's population on it 's own . 
  cheap chinese goods enable millions of poor people to live in , in global comparison , a ridicuously good standard of living ( walmart-style ) . 
  tbh completely honest the real victims of the global trade system are n't the fucking brits who live the life of the top 10 % . 
  it 's the third world which , up to this date decades , after the decolonization , is stuck in an global system of abuse . 
  not to say that the brits should n't complain . 
  it 's their good right not to care about africa because nobody cares about them either . 
  globalization * did * fuck them over . 
  racism usually is a symptom of that ( `` why are these immigrants getting help and we are n't '' ) . 
  they have real problems that will only get worse and need serious help . 
  the problem is that stunts like brexit , people like trump or parties like the goddamn afd are no solution . 
  their proposals are shit , they solve nothing , they use post-truth politics to abuse the poor people to get them into power even though their policies would fuck them over even more . 
  they deserve better than that . 
  in the end globalization ( excluding the immigration part ) is a very good thing and there 's no way to get away from it . 
  what we need are domestic and international reforms to help with good wealth distribution , reforms to offset the affects of automization ( aka minimum income tc . ), 
  and , most importantly , education . 
  that 's what pisses me off . 
  even though i 'm firmly left wing i believe a solid right wing party is necessary for a healthy democracy . 
  but somehow all we ended up with are incompetent post-truth-politics parties , many of them focussing single issues ( immigration ) . 
  for fucks sake , the afd officials even admit that reality has no place in their ideology , they want to use social media bots and they do n't even show up to work . 
  the poor and uneducated need a voice but the currently rising right wing populists are no solution . 
  and all these ` concerned citizens ' doing / r/europe a favour by preventing the brown masses from not integrating by burning down refugee shelters ? 
  totally not racist !, 
  or the afd , * literally stating on tape that facts do n't matter and the perception of reality is more important than reality * ? 
  totally not populist !, 
  itt : right wing victim complex striking again . 
  that was a beatiful write-up , thank you . 
  the cultural difference in the perception of free speach can be enormous . 
  i just wanted to add that human dignity is literally the highest principle of the constitution . 
  in german law it ca n't be restricted by anything else . 
  this norm is eternally valid in the constitution and ca n't be changed . 
  the government is both responsible not to violate human dignity itself but it also needs to prevent the people from doing so . 
  this includes racial discrimination and racial branding . 
  if preventing these means limiting free speech , the government is obliged to do so . 
  denying refugees who have their life threatened entrance is against human rights . 
  denying immigrants is not . 
  what the fuck dude . 
  our holocaust memorials are not used to `` shame '' german people . 
  they are used as a place to mourn and a place to remember not to let this stuff happen ever again . 
  because the holocaust was a part of our history and as such formed our culture , values and identity as of today . 
  you mistake responsibility for guilt . 
  stop with your victim complex . 
  e : imo destroying the columbus statue is stupid . 
  but i have nothing against erecting something to remember about the slave trade . 
  this pisses me of so much . 
  i 'm was born too late to experience the unification but i know about real backstory of `` we are the people '' , maybe the greatest chant this country has ever seen . 
  but when the tagesschau played a clip from 1989 ( i just heard it , did n't see the video ) i literally winced . 
  these words are demonized in the eyes of young people , the younger generations of germany .
