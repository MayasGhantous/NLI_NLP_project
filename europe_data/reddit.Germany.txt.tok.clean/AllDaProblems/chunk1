people in premium cars ( bmw , benz , porsche , audi ) easily go around 170-220 km/h when there is little traffic ( especially commuters in black company cars ) . 
  poor people mostly stick to 140 km/h with the occasional swoop to the left to piss off the rich bastards, 
  gr\u00fc\u00df gott bei gott oh mein gott gott sei dank g\u00f6ttlich um gottes willen ... you get the idea fleeing and not fighting the enemy is not socially acceptable in any culture . 
  one woman even said that their men should stay and fight * for their rights * . 
  what these people are saying is completely natural , just because they 're using other expressions it does not make them radical . 
  that 's simply their language, 
  so by that logic the majority of muslims in muslim countries should be unemployed . . 
  you 're absolutely right mate . 
  from the personal point of view though , i can totally get them . 
  if someone turned my country into hell and forced me out of my comfortable ( student ) life , making me leave all my dreams and aspirations behind , i would feel quite the same . 
  it 's a tragedy, 
  guys do n't forget that these people might have had better lives in syria/iraq compared to what they experience now . 
  some of them might have been students or shop/business owners . 
  of course they 'll want to get back to their standard of living or at least to their future prospects . 
  no they 're in prison because they spread lies and support terrorism there have been many coups in turkey which were organised by outside governments . 
  erdogan is fighting exactly that, 
  turkey is not doing anything wrong at this moment . 
  that isis affiliation is nothing but a lie . 
  no real evidence, 
  oh , i did not know erdogan and akp commited those crimes a hundred years ago !, 
  also , universities in the uk seem to be much better funded financially . 
  they often have better technology ( and maybe education ) to offer as a result, 
  man what do you think those syrian refugees do in turkey ? 
  by far not all of them got shelter , they live on the streets etc. 
  mate turkey is no third world country ... 
  what the fuck man i 'm leaving for uni in the uk this month baby do n't leave me now , you 'll take away the biggest part of me, 
  oh man you 've never worked in a restaurant or on a construction site have you ? 
  fener can be associated with everything that 's going wrong in this world , so no surprise, 
  surely him and many other romanians will support turkey by sitting in front of their computers and making reddit announcements, 
  oh yeah why do n't you go on explaining them turks their culture ? 
  they 're mostly designed in cologne mate, 
  then there are so many western newspapers avoiding the term `` terrorist '' when referring to the pkk . 
  those people kidnap , murder and ** terrorise ** , yet they 're not being called terrorist . 
  ** every ** terrorist organisation must be fought against . 
  and turkey is practising this the best by fighting religious extremists and left-wing extremists at the same time . 
  no they 're actually doing quite fine in their country and only come here for social benefits . 
  why ? 
  did you get a new one ? 
  fuck off man it 's people from your country who come to richer parts of europe and steal and molest . 
  what the fuck man i would n't have believed that a week ago but then my friend told me about her 4th of july in chicago . 
   around 9,000 people [ 5 ] -- mostly elderly -- died during the 2003 heatwave in germany . 
  wow, 
  i learnt * italian * from my sicilian colleagues but i ca n't get a single word out of what my friend from napoli says, 
  what did people do with the half pence ? 
  why are non-turkish people asking turkish people to enter a war ? 
  go fight the war yourself if you have the balls to do so , bastard, 
  for someone to be punished for anything you said there , there would need to be 4 witnesses ** actually ** seeing people commit adultery/homosexual sex . 
  without the rule of akp there would never have been a party like hdp in parliament . 
  you could say that the until a few years ago neglected central of turkey votes for akp . 
  lol, 
  if it were like that , there 'd be much more aggressively anti-secular parties in parliament ( saadet for example ), 
  my family immigrated into germany decades ago . 
  i know what it looks like in some subcultures here . 
  idiotic statements like `` muslims do n't fit in here '' are simple oversimplifications of much more complicated matters . 
  what the fuck, 
  turkey is n't the middle east either . 
  it 's the bridge between europe and the east . 
  it 's directly bordering eu member states and its most important city is located in europe . 
  haha dutch sounds like people did not know if they should speak english or german , so they chose both, 
  whenever i see opel headlights in the dark i get scared for almost no reason, 
   i ca n't imagine that norway and turkey have much in common , though, 
  yeah but do we ever eat bread with every single meal ? 
  in turkey they eat white bread for breakfast , for lunch and for dinner . 
  keep in mind that those three meals are all served hot and one person easily eats half a loaf of bread for each of them . 
  akp are not islamists . 
  they are pan-islamists i 'd say . 
  or neo-ottomans, 
  burning cars in offenbach ? 
  good, 
  the point is that this is not , in any way , comparable to the holocaust . 
   turkey instead has repeatedly proposed the formation of an international committee of historians , including people with a range of perspectives to debate the issue . 
  such a group of experts would be better qualified than politicians to understand the facts , according to turkey . 
  how many people exactly have been killed by islamists in germany ? 
  go to / r/islam and read the [ faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/wiki/index ) please . 
  your views may change, 
  they occupy half of cyprus because if they did not , the turkish cypriots would be discriminated against again, 
  the huge majority of german mosques are funded by ditib , the turkish body for islamic affairs, 
  banning religious books , the call for prayer and everything culturally islamic ( even clothing ! ), 
  is essentially anti-islamic . 
  seriously this is stupid . 
  - there are ** far ** more muslims than buddhists in turkey , and probably as well at that uni - this has become a fight ** against ** a certain political agenda and ** not for ** a buddhist temple just let them build their mosque there . 
  what 's wrong about having a mosque on campus ? 
  if there really are buddhist students , make them a sufficient room available to practice their religion . 
  no need to be all anti-islamic ( or as they call it in turkey , * atat\u00fcrkc\u00fc * ), 
  much deeper than that http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/afghanistan\u2013turkey_relations, 
  you 'd see them if you looked down for a minute, 
  i do n't know about that . . 
  i guess there are way more people watching football on zdf than people watching some weird alpine sports, 
  do n't forget the champions league . 
  what would the poor german do without his wednesday night cl football ? 
  so you want many many young people who were not lucky enough to be born in a wealthy family to start life with a disadvantage ? 
  is it not much easier to provide for the poor so everyone can have equal chances ? 
  why try and make it harder for some people ? 
  ( my parents paid for my license and i am an ** excellent ** driver  ), 
  come on man that can not be the answer . 
  the system has many shitty parts and those need to be adressed . 
  i am going to uni and thanks to some `` hippies '' in the 60s i get a lot of financial aid from the state . 
  you may not agree with their agenda , but it is certain that the world needs exactly these kind of people to become a better place in the long run, 
  go on a 2000km trip with such an old car and then do the same with a modern car . 
  tell us more about how far we 've fallen after that please,
