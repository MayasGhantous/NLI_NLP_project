and then divide by 2 again because only half of these refugees will get asylum, 
  my point about the previous poster was that he was defaming islam as a violent religion while he himself lives in a society that shares `` different values '' based on another religion , i simply pointed out that neither religion is inherently violent . 
  so i agree with you entirely  just not with the previous guy :p, 
  well it could still be a no if the mother is still alive and never learned about her sons death to this day . 
  it 's about religion and he described that religion and pointed out that it is a common religion in the west , that does n't make it a western exclusive religion . 
  i was simply pointing out that this religion is not more peacful than the religion you described as follows :  waging a holy war in his name , stoning women for adultery , throwing homosexuals from tall buildings or taking women as slaves to rape and sell . 
  i simply said that christianity is also frequently used to justify horrible things like that , which in return was supposed to point out that neither religion is inherently more violent or backwards than the other . 
  then why is everyone allowed to blame islam alone as a backwards and super violent religion ? 
   it 's also regarded as morally abhorrent in the west , because of those nice things we call western values . 
  has nothing to do with legality . 
  [ see these kinds of people ? 
  ] ( http://www.nowtheendbegins.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fred-phelps-westboro-baptist-cult-leader-hate-preacher-dead.jpg ) bet they would love to teach muslim-scum some proper `` western values '' . 
  there are plenty of people that do n't share your precious `` values '' in your society already and they would throw gays out of windows and stone women that perform adultery . 
  them not acting on it has everything to do with legality . 
   sounds like you 're getting dangerously close to acknowledging that africa has different cultural values than europe , are you a racist ? 
  you claimed those `` values '' were inherent only in western communities not me , 
   stoning women for adultery , throwing homosexuals from tall buildings or taking women as slaves to rape and sell . 
  just because it 's illegal in most european countries . 
  would love to see you defend that `` peaceful 21st century '' religion down in africa . 
  and it wo n't be even when taking in 800 000 refugees , what 's your point ? 
  considering refugees , when accepted , get working permits and are allowed to search for housing themselves that sure would be the case . 
  handling 60 000 in one weekend is simply putting a strain on the system , that 's no surprise . 
  yes , this could very well become an issue that we should be aware of , i think that is one reason why we introduced border controls and regulation on the influx again . 
  i think though if we can get back to an orderly process again we should be able to deal with these problems . 
   about 74 % rejected asylums , and only 10-20 thousand deported per year . 
  as far as i can tell about 50 % are not leaving even though they should ( 40 900 `` ausreisepflichtig '' vs. 21 700 actually leaving ) and that off itself is of course a problem , totally agree there . 
  there are legal immigration ways and people that are not granted asylum have to take these or stay out . 
  but as far as i can see the government already reacted to this with recently sanctioned policies about not being able to work and not getting benefits after being rejected . 
  i wonder why other nations are more successful here ( as mentioned in the article ), 
  the refugees should n't be muslims, 
   many of the rejected majority will still stay in germany/eu without being able to work or get any benefits . 
   these people are all a burden , and the majority should not be accepted for entry into the eu . 
  even according to your numbers 58 % , the majority , is not accepted for refugee status and is eventually deported ( numbers for germany , 55 % for whole europe ) . 
   actually , nobody should be accepted to roam free inside the eu borders until their status is determined . 
  and they are n't ? 
  some were allowed to travel to germany and austria ( both on a voluntary basis ) nothing more , if they got checked in any other country they would be sent back to hungary/first country they arrived . 
   as for the second point : i 'm not saying a single country should process them . 
  there should be a refugee zone at the outer border of the eu ( romania-hungary-croatia-etc . 
  ) , where asylum requests are handed in . 
  these requests are distributed by preassigned quotas ( at the processing phase ) . 
  once an asylum request is decided , the refugee is transported to a member state , specified by the quotas . 
  as you can see i do n't think the quota system is inherently wrong , but i do think that distributing refugees before their eligibility for asylum is decided is really misguided ( when their numbers are this overwhelming ) . 
  i would agree with this if we were n't in a situation like we are now , if we have 2 years to build these facilities and invest money in infrastructure and education for workers there to maybe learn arabic or employ psychologists , etc. 
  but this is an out-of-the-ordinary event , we have facilities inside the eu to cope with many more refugees than are coming , but not in a single country , if you simply bottleneck them at 1,2 or 3 entries ( like we did until now ) then there are going to be problems , italy cried for years for more help and we did n't do anything , now hungary is having issues too and greece does n't really care so we have hundreds of thousands of refugees arriving at the border states and they do n't have to power to process them in a reasonable time . 
  i agree that `` usually '' we should handle it in a more controlled manner this would be better for everyone , but these people have already spent years in refugee camps in turkey , syria , libanon , etc. 
  and are now coming to europe after long journeys under terrible conditions , telling them `` wait here we will build some facilities you can be processed in the next two years '' is not going to go over well . 
  we simply have to act quickly if we want to successfully integrate them into our society and maybe take a few risks we would n't have to take if we had more time or less people coming . 
   medical risk as in these people can carry some nasty infections : tuberculosis , leprosy , etc. 
  ok first , there are very few infected with diseases like that , we have vaccines and even if there is an infection our medical system is more than able to deal with this . 
  the risk is marginal and the effect is almost neglectable , it should be considered but it 's not a strong point really . 
   my point is that a large number of these people are probably not eligible for asylum and they come in the hopes of finding a better life . 
  they probably do n't know much about the asylum process , what they think is that they 'll get a well-paid job in germany if they manage to slip through the security checks . 
  that 's why asylum request processing should happen at the border of the eu with every denied person immediately deported . 
  that 's true to some extent , but it 's not possible for one single country to process that many people in a reasonable time and in fact many of these people are eligible for asylum , so what are you going to do with those ? 
  keep them all in hungary that is not able to support them ? 
  i am not saying `` take them all in '' or anything of the sorts , i say we have to find a better solution than to dump everything on italy and hungary and let them deal with it . 
  so yeah i guess that diverted quite a bit from the initial point , but yeah ... 
   it will only have a worse effect on your asylum process if you were eligible for one at the first place . 
  no the whole process to prove your identity is way more difficult if you have no passport which is a negative influence . 
   if you 're an economic migrant then throwing away your passport is the only thing that will help you get the asylum you want . 
  true but it is very very very rarely rewarded . 
   that 's way more security/medical risk how so ? 
  i mean medical , i guess you have a point there , but most eu citizens are vaccinated and for security , if they got accepted in hungary they can go wherever they want already so i do n't see how it is `` more '' of a risk we take ... 
   syrian refugee : anyone can be syrian if they throw away their passports at a suitable border . 
  then you need a long screening process to determine who 's actually syrian . 
  this process can take months ( years ) , and it 's much harder to deport someone who 's already there . 
  throwing away your passport will actually have a worse effect on your asylum process and if asylum is not granted they will not get any benefits and are not allowed to work , do n't really see a point here ...  valid claim to asylum : investigating the background of several hundred thousand people is no easy feat . 
  letting these unchecked ( for terrorists and infections ) people to roam around freely in the eu is ridiculous . 
  yeah , the process has always been like this and it 's not like they can `` roam freely '' they will be subject to inspection anytime they try to buy/rent a house , get residency , etc. 
  if they do n't register for refugee status they do n't get benefits , residence permits , work visas , etc , they live in a limbo , i do n't see how that is benefiting them . 
  how does that relate to anything the previous comment said ? ... 
  thanks for the clarification , i know there were talks about changing this , did n't realize they actually did it already , 
   stop getting so defensive i am not getting defensive i am simply stating the flaws in your `` theory ''  `` oh fuck we ca n't handle them , now we want to force you guys to take them '' so quick timeline : * april/may/june , germany among others wants quotas in , no one talks about it or anything is finalized mainly because of poland and the uk , partly because italy and others are not satisfied with the numbers * juli/august , hungary begins to feel huge pressure and decides to shut it 's borders sealed , people sleep in the open at train stations waiting to either be processed , but rather to move to different countries and try their luck there * 24th august germany declares it will not send back syrian refugees to first eu-country and organizes trains/transportation for a bunch of refugees from hungary to germany to process them locally , germany is now called the bad guy for `` abusing schengen '' and letting immigrants travel `` illegally '' * every day after that germany is called out for being the root cause for all the refugees because `` they invited everyone '' ( which is factually further from reality than sergio ramos ' penalty miss ) but factually being one of the few countries that actually improved the situation for the border countries and refugees during all this time the enemies of the quotas stayed resilient , not a single time did it seem even close to get anywhere near the quotas and now you say germany is pressuring everyone because we ca n't handle it ? 
  no germany is pressuring everyone because everyone does n't want to handle it . 
  it 's been not even 4 weeks since merkel said what is so controversial , i doubt any single refugee setting out because of what she said arrived in germany until now . 
  bullshit [ this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/how-eu-promises-to-introduce-refugee-quotas-failed-a-1040226.html ) article from ** june ** already shows the stance of many countries inside the eu not willing to enact quotas or any solution to the problem really . 
  merkel did n't ** invite ** a single person stop spewing that bullshit around , she simply suspended the dublin agreements for syrian refugees which is specifically allowed in the treaty itself . 
  and she did it to relieve pressure from hungary , greece and italy in order to get them as allies and create policies with their `` help '' . 
  stop skewing reality and blaming everything on germany , no one is trying to get a solution to this problem and the reason for that is surely not `` germany invites them '' . 
  it 's a political game form all sides for influence and power nothing more . 
  there are probably also differences in local languages , in german the `` fanatic '' counterpart is rarely used and media immediately calls everyone an extremist instead . 
   874 years old i am , much to learn from me you still have young padawan \\ - still yoda, 
  it 's more of a policy problem as you can just apply for asylum again even if you got rejected once , that 's why a lot of the balkan people come back . 
  on the other hand i do n't really blame ( some of ) them , we accepted them as refugees in the 90 's and 10 years later just deported most of them , their homes destroyed 10 years gone , most of their friends probably gone and/or dead , at the very least alienated , they built a life in germany and were kicked out . 
  i 'd try to get back there asap too . 
   so they will have no way to live besides ... robbing , selling drugs , or ngos ? 
  or you know going back to their original countries where they probably have family and can get a passport again ? 
  we tried that once ... 
   thats what quota 's are for quotas no one fucking agrees to ?? 
  well it may mean that to * you *  fanatic  noun  1 . a person filled with excessive and single-minded zeal , especially for an extreme religious or political cause . 
  i think someone thinking he is a chosen one by the most important figure in his religion is definitely a fanatic , an extremist on the other hand is a different thing and probably closer to your definition . 
   would you have a problem with the dalai lama or the karmapa ? 
  i do n't have a problem with them nor with the pope nor with anyone else in particular . 
  i am not saying a fanatic is a bad person , the previous poster did , i was simply pointing out that his view of religion and fanatics thereof is skewed, 
  him killing someone will hardly have any influence on his current mental state . 
   being a religious fanatic is a mental problem . 
  arguably the pope is a religious fanatic , he even thinks he specifically is sent by god to represent him , if that 's not the definition of fanatic then i do n't know what is . 
  so the pope has a mental problem ? 
   a dangerous time this is for your apprentice ... for you .
