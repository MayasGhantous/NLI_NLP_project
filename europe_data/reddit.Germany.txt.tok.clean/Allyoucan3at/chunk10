  we have to find a way to cooperation , not towards proxy states under oppressive regimes that do what we tell them to as long as we keep them in power . 
  we have to actually stand in for our values even if that means oil prices go up . 
   sooo ... that 's why the public support for fighting is is so high right now in germany right ? 
  no , public support is so low , because we see that `` the fight against terrorism '' that we rage for 30 years now is not working the way we fight it and we continue to repeat our mistakes over and over again with just more lives lost and more enemies gained . 
  afghanistan , iraq , lybia , we go in there with brute force thinking we could strike off the head and be on our way , but that 's not how it works . 
  no society is able to be reformed from one day to another and if you fight wars with little regard to collateral damage you will make the common population resent you very much . 
  also political games after these wars brought nothing but despise ... 
  i could go on here . 
  it 's not about resenting isis and their ideology , it 's about the way we go about trying to destroy it . 
   it will fade away just as every other event in human history did then why is it still in our minds ? 
  there have been other , way more recent conflicts , not much less bloody or dangerous ( on a lower scale admittedly ) wwii is so predominant not only because it is the `` most recent '' european conflict . 
  it was a change of mind for most of the world . 
  the thought that bad ideologies have to be fought and destroyed is so fundamental nowadays because of that war and that 's nothing we will forget in the near future and it 's also the reason we remind ourselves of past events . 
  i think we learned a little from our past which is actually a really good thing imo . 
  and this lecture is repeated as long as it is going to be relevant which i think ( and hope ) will be until societal downfall . 
  german agencies also work closely with the respective embassies , so if someone claims they are syrian , they can check with the syrian embassy if they have any records of the person . 
  [ there 's a flag on the field !, 
  [ this institute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wzb_berlin_social_science_center ) did the survey , not particularly affiliated with any media agency as far as i can see , guess it just did n't fit your agenda , so sorry to hear that . 
  might very well even take a two/multi-state solution to make things work , i think that western influence is not going to do any good though , we should learn that our rules do n't necessarily apply to them with regards to politics , they wo n't just become democratic countries because you tell them they are now . 
  it was a long and painful path for europe/the west riddled with wars and the only successful `` democratizations '' were done in colonial territory by simply eradicating anyone opposing the colonial powers . 
  [ actually most of them do [ german ] ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/syrische-fluechtlinge-umfrage-untersucht-fluchtgruende-a-1056567.html ) around 92 % want to return to syria for sure , but things have to change first , the end of the war ( 67 % ) , assad stepping down ( 51.5 % ) and the retreat/destruction of isis ( 43.8 % ) are the major factors . 
   you can check backgrounds and intern everyone who ca n't identify themselves until an identity is established , as they do in usa . 
  yea but in order to confirm them being terrorists you would have to actually know the identity of every potential terrorist and `` interning '' them without premise is simply illegal due to every constitution ever , so now that 's not an option . 
   hell , even i as a norwegian citizen ca n't travel to berlin without some sort of id . 
  well as a german i can even travel to sofia , madrid or stockholm without any kind of id . 
  do n't see why only non-citizens can be terrorists ... 
   we now have absolute proof that terrorists from syria can use our lax immigration policy to infiltrate our countries . 
  i doubt anyone ever disputed that , it was clear from the beginning that you ca n't sort them all out . 
  not sure what kind of action you are thinking would stop this entirely , i heavily doubt there is a fool-proof way to prevent terrorists from entering europe , `` lax '' asylum policies or no . 
  i figure they burn for quite some time ... 
  i beg to differ . 
  there are many programs and papers that have differentiated views on every topic thinkable . 
  it 's much more diverse than us-tv , although the `` big fish '' ( mainly everything under axel springer ) do follow the same agenda . 
  you have to look for reliable and objective reports , obviously , but that 's the case for any topic you would like to inform yourself about . 
  yup , also considering that there are in fact around 10mil . 
  people that do n't have a passport/nationality worldwide ( can have various reasons , like countries disbanding ) it 's really no surprise there are a few of them applying for asylum at any given time . 
  syrian embassy in germany , yes . 
  so is afghan , iraqi and most other embassies , that 's what they are here for . 
  so you think that retaliating a horrible act with another is a fair shot at justice ? 
  more than 500 arson attacks on refugee homes in germany alone , a stabbed mayoral candidate and much , much , more . 
  it is very clear that the refugees sparked an increase in violent crimes , but not because they committed them ... 
  actually , the embassies of `` likely '' countries of origin are cooperating with german authorities to determine nationality . 
  1.61 % without passports ( or without nationality ) according to [ bamf ( official agency ) ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201509-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) totalling 4.898 by october 1st 2015, 
  so it 's 200 % more likely it stands for france born and raised youth compared to foreign born youth , gotcha . 
  [ that 's the german agencies report for 2015 so far ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201509-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) * 24.3 % syrian * 14.8 % albanian * 11.4 % kosovo * 7.5 % serbia * ~ 5.4 % iraqi and afghan respectively * 2.4 % eritrea also interesting are acceptance quotas for the different groups syrians , iraqis and eritreans have acceptance rates of  80 % while serbians , kosovars and albanians have < 1 % acceptance rates . 
  for immigrants already in germany [ refer to this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany ) . 
  the overwhelming majority is of european origin , the single largest group is from turkey and all african nations together only build a tiny group . 
   you know what , you 're damn cool . 
  thanks man , that 's appreciated , a lot of people on here do n't seem to think so as my comments usually get all kinds of downvotes xd  i like my culture , i love it , i would n't want anything else it 's really live and let live for me . 
  everyone lives by the same rules some surely more privileged than others , but in the end we are all in the same boat and we should start rowing together instead of hitting each other with the paddle . 
  my flair is accurate . 
  from the southern region around stuttgart to be precise . 
  i totally agree with you !, 
  i am not sure if stuff like [ forbidding the burka ] ( http://www.welt.de/regionales/nrw/article147806706/duesseldorfer-grundschule-verbietet-burka-und-nikab.html ) in schools is really going to help anyone . 
  i actually do n't think muslims need any `` special '' kind of integration at all . 
  there are a multitude of ethnicities living in all of europe for centuries and i bet you could come up with all kinds of statistics which one is `` more violent '' , `` more extremist '' or `` more prone to live off welfare '' , but nobody cares . 
  i think this whole demonizing of islam started in the 80 's / 90 's when the conflicts in afghanistan , iraq and iran were brewing . 
  before that we even invited them by the tens of thousands to work here and no one seemed to mind a great deal . 
  granted these conflicts sparked some very dangerous groups like the taliban , al quaida and isis . 
  nobody seems to care though that young girls get abducted in latin american countries by drug gangs or that tourists disappear in south east asia all the time . 
  it seems only relevant to report situations when a fanatical religious , preferably islamic , group tortures , kills and abducts . 
  but it 's not only the media to be blamed , they just send/write/print what the people read . 
  yea it does seem so , but i am fairly certain that 's an `` illusion '' created mainly by biased media coverage . 
  honestly if a christian nutjob with no power says `` we want christian law to rule everything , abortion is murder , we should burn gays '' nobody particularly cares , but if muslims say stupid shit everyone goes batshit insane about `` invasion '' and `` islamification '' . 
  it 's a foreign religion so i guess people are just more sensitive about that , but the current rhetoric many people seem to have is just malicious not only because it discriminates one single religion . 
  refugee centres are burning , politicians get stabbed in the street in the middle of the day `` because of their refugee politics '' , people say `` sadly our internment camps are not operational right now '' . 
  it can turn dangerous really , really quickly from that point on . 
  until now many people still strongly oppose these views and speak up against it and they are outliers , etc. 
  but if we keep raising these useless polls that are supposed to show what exactly ? 
  that islamism is in fact worse than everything else ? 
  we feed the fire with oil . 
  obviously !, 
  i meant to use it like it was intended to anyway , as the secret currency of the mayan space travellers , duh !, 
  or use , you know , a compass ? 
   i still do n't particularly think it is right neither do i. 
  it is just very dangerous to single out one group because you do n't agree with them specifically . 
  think about why are there no polls on bankers opinions on lawmaking or school childrens ? 
  i just feel like a lot of times these `` interesting polls '' are an excuse to speak up against islamism because it 's flavour of the month to do so . 
  i was not really evaluating the effectiveness of it , i was just trying to explain , why refugees are more expensive in western countries than in huge refugee camps at the border . 
   the money spend on them would go in to the european economy as material goods and boost the income of regular europeans not limp dick politicians , bureaucrat and layers . 
  what you describe is called opportunity cost and is considered in every major investment . 
  the question here is whether this should be seen as `` an investment '' in the classical sense . 
  strictly economically you would most likely be better off spending it otherwise obviously . 
  well that 's lobbying for you . 
  whether that 's `` right '' ... it 's legal . 
  i do n't think any one person is purely above their personal believes and would `` force '' laws many people do n't want if it 's in their interest . 
  these people just think their laws would be better `` for everyone '' or do n't care about the ones they are not better for , just like everybody else . 
  the reason it costs so much more in europe is that you have to pay wages to the workers processing them , so this money is not really going to the refugees themselves but to people working on anything related to refugees . 
  they do n't just need food . 
  houses need be built , local governments will stock up , more teachers , etc. 
  who says the laws they 'd like to implement are not reasonable ? 
  also is n't it kind of obvious that you would rather have laws implemented that benefit you personally or your religion/company/whatever ? 
  ask 10 businessmen how they would like to have laws made and they 'd say `` better laws for businesses '' ... 
  i totally agree with most everything you said . 
  the current programs have questionable results at best and the special treatment leaves a bad taste in my mouth too . 
   they need to change it . 
  but can your reasonably expect them to ? 
   german muslims start to perform an intra-islamic debate . 
  this is definitely an integral part and probably the most important one . 
  if you are only fed one narrative all the time , you just start to believe it eventually .
