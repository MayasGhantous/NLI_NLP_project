  if you would ask me , what is more important to me , the rules of my fantasy football league or the rules of the nation , i would probably say fantasy football league , because to me personally , that is more important . 
  if you would ask `` if these two rules collide , which one would you choose to obey '' , that is a totally different question here . 
  but as long as the 15 seconds people invest into these kinds of articles confirm your already negative bias you tend to overlook all the flaws these statistics have . 
  why ? 
  is it just that you have no clue about the religion and are therefore afraid ? 
  honest question here , because i really do n't get why many are so afraid that there are plenty of other people that believe in different things . 
  yes that 's exactly what my source states , i just simplified it in my summary a bit, 
  yes we certainly could do that , so could all of our neighbours and in the end , the only countries that would have to take in refugees at all would be italy and greece , but then again dublin also states that in case of an extreme situation the eu should find a solution to relieve these countries if they ca n't handle it anymore . 
  so we begin at square one again . 
   according to the dublin regulation . 
  even according the the 1950 's human rights treaty actually . 
  you help us this time , ja ? 
  the question is not whether it 's 100 % effective , but whether it 's worth it . 
  if this fence holds off 1000 refugees that would usually cost you 10.000 $ each , but you have to build fences for 100 million you can just keep the fence unbuilt , pay for the refugees instead and safe 90 % of your money . 
  i 'm not saying that 's the case right here , but asking the question whether something really is worth it is hardly idiotic . 
  most eu countries actually have very similar policies on refugees and immigration . 
  for germany specifically i found [ this ] ( http://www.nds-fluerat.org/leitfaden/10-fluechtlinge-mit-aufenthaltserlaubnis-nach-25-abs-1-oder-abs-2-satz-1-alternative-1-aufenthg/82wohnen-umziehen-und-reisen/ ) ( german ) : * you can travel inside the eu , you will get a tourist visa for 3 months , you ca n't work in any other country * you can not move to another country , you have to stay in the country you applied ( and got accepted ) in for at least 5 years . 
  * if you travel back to your country you might lose your refugee status ( after all you get it because you fear for your life in that country ) the linked source is a social organization helping refugees in nrw . 
  you are talking about the real world ? 
  i gave you official numbers that clearly show it 's an abysmally small problem that people throw away their passport , again around 1.6 % of all refugee applications can not clearly be identified with regards to nationality and there are in fact many people in the world that do not have a nationality , most of them will probably try to find asylum somewhere so it is reasonable to assume that they are disproportionately apparent with regards to overall population . 
  you on the other did n't even try to discuss anything you just post the next populist question just so you can feel superior to people fleeing war and famine . 
  i do n't want to discuss with people like you , you quote news articles that source a single person as `` facts '' and base your whole opinion on that . 
  you are not looking at any real facts objectively or even try to find them and when i point that out you say i am aggressive . 
  that 's really no base for any discussion , you have your opinion , keep it . 
  very scientific and not a single opinion at all . 
  we have been conducting actual warfare in most of these countries for decades and he claims they wage hybrid warfare ? 
  that 's just pathetic really . 
  what do you want from me ? 
  you keep coming up with ridicolous questions for whatever you are trying to say here and do nothing yourself . 
  i present answers to your questions that you just simply ignore and then go and pose the next question . 
  so every german refugee should be accepted because our country was devastated by outside forces too , we should imprison roosevelt and stalin . 
  no doubt there are still tensions there , but it 's not enough to be a `` refugee '' at all , you are not systematically prosecuted by a minority in power or anything of the sort . 
  well if you try to trick the authorities illegally you have no right to asylum , if you can get away with it , there wo n't be any numbers on it . 
  i doubt you can find reliable statistics about that . 
  i would guess it 's irrelevant to the big picture too , but who knows . 
  and if you have any further questions and are really interested in finding the truth , why not ask `` tante google '' ? 
  i mean i am no encyclopaedia here i have to search through official reports just as everyone else , so if you really want to make an argument for yourself , do some research . 
  the statistics also show that this has been decreasing in september though , so declaring them as safe countries seems to have some effect . 
  around 15 % less applications from balkan countries , but with respect to the previous year , almost 10 times as many people from kosovo applied for asylum ( 3.173 in 2014 vs 31.446 in 2015 ) and almost as high numbers for albanians ( other balkan nations increased slightly too ), 
  [ source ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/meldungen/de/2015/20151007-asylgeschaeftsstatistik-september.html ) * in september 43.071 new refugee applications in germany * 126 % more than in sept. 2014 and 18 % more than in august 2015 * 16.838 from syria * 11.712 from the balkan nations * 22.983 refugees were processed in september 2015 ( 166 % more than in september 2014 ) * 8.690 approved ( + 416 * ) * total percentage of approved in 2015 is 39,1 % and 39,6 % in september 2015 * 10.195 rejected * 3.682 applications were retracted by the applicant or redirected according to the dublin treaties * total number of refugees is not equal to the number of applications : * 164.000 new asylum seekers entered germany in september 2015 * totalling to about 577.000 in 2015 * these numbers are recorded by their software `` easy '' everyone can download , which can be unreliable as the identity of a refugee is not necessary in this system and everyone can , but nobody must use the software . 
  [ total numbers and statistics for september and 2015 ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201509-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.html?nn=1367522 ) ( german ) \\* this includes people that can not be deported by international law and people under special protection edit : ** i messed up the title stating `` new refugees '' instead of `` new applications '' , that was an honest mistake and i apologize **, 
  the embassy might have records of the guy ? 
  finger prints , passport photos , dna-records , relatives . 
  if the guy gives you a false name he wo n't be able to bring his family ( which most want ) because you ca n't identify them belonging together . 
  throwing your passport away is simply no good idea if you are applying for refugee status , the process takes way longer than with papers and again the chances are abysmally small . 
  and just for the record there are n't many that even try that . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201509-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) are the numbers for 2015 ( incl . 
  sept. ) , germany , official source : out of over 300.000 people the identity of around 5.000 was not determined yet . 
  some will have their identity determined during the process the previous article described . 
  that 's 1.66 % , the unhcr guesses that there are indeed around [ 10 million ] ( http://www.unhcr.de/questions-und-answers/staatenlose.html ) people without any nationality worldwide . 
  everybody loves football and beer !, 
  duldungen are not related to statelessness per se . 
  they are a special form of temporary residence permit . 
  yes it specifically talks about processes how to determine the country of origin ( by sending them to different embassies of possible home countries ), 
  that 's asylum laws you are talking about , once your asylum process is complete and you are rejected you are deported to your home country , no matter where you are from . 
   pakistanis , ghanians and others who claim to be fleeing war and persecution ( but in reality are in the same boat as the balkan migrants ) : come here . 
  the asylum process is very complex and i doubt anyone not directly working with them ( or being part of their legislation ) is really qualified enough to judge whether the conditions are `` tough '' or lush . 
  i 'll have to trust the authorities here that they do a good job ( which i am sure they do ) . 
  not everyone from pakistan or ghana will be accepted as a refugee that 's simply a false assumption . 
  everyone is ( by law ) processed as a single entity and then a decision is made on general criteria . 
  most come here exactly for family reunion so that is off the table already . 
  many countries in fact do keep records of finger prints . 
  also if you are registered anywhere by finger prints you can be identified through that ( former refugee camps , criminal activity , high security jobs your worked before , travelling to some countries ) . 
  they might also have passport photos available that they can compare . 
  it really is not as big a problem as many make it out to be , yes you can get a residence permit if you throw your passport away . 
  the chance to get away with it are abysmally small though as the authorities will try everything to not let it happen and they have a lot at their disposal . 
   oh well , you can use anecdotes to prove your point , i still think there is a slight difference somewhere . 
  still , that 's an interesting conversation , and all religions pretending to promote peace and good should be held to the highest standard . 
  well my point was that there are religious nutjobs that kill for their religion and every religion has them . 
  whether some have more than others ... probably . 
  i think the main reason we `` see '' more islamic violence and extremism is because of its origins . 
  you have to remember that prior to the 80 's there was almost no quarrel between the western world and muslim countries . 
  some former colonies were still very displeased , mainly because of continuous territorial claims by former powers and israel was n't popular ( for obvious reasons ) , but overall there was n't much hostility , the saudis were already strong allies of the us and many mesopotamian nations fought alongside the british in wwi and wwii . 
  it escalated with the russian invasion in afghanistan and the us funded taliban . 
  the russians were seen as invaders and the homeland had to be defended , religious groups could gather a lot of people to their cause just like in many other invasive military actions in history and a lot of governments before and after succumbed to the political games during the cold war , where both sides tried to gain political power by manipulation and coups . 
  we then continued to wage multiple wars most notably in iraq and afghanistan , because we think we know better . 
  we messed up the whole region and were rightfully blamed for that . 
  these nations developed an anti sentiment towards the west under heavy influence from religious and political groups that felt ( and were ) betrayed . 
  so a lot of their hatred is projected onto the west , mainly the us and we are their targets ( you do n't see many islamic terrorist attacks in russia or china for example ) . 
   loss of manufacturing and r&d volume . 
  shift , towards energy production , the money does n't just disappear . 
   but if today 's pv power comes in at 99 % the cost of fossil and tomorrow 's at 90 % , the country that subsidies the premature roll-out of the 99 % technology will find itself at a costly disadvantage to the one that kept burning carbon until 90 % became mass-producible . 
  that largely depends on the speed of change . 
  if tomorrow it is 90 % and the day after it 's 80 % then you bet the one already owning 3 million solar panels is better off than the one having to build them first . 
  germany started in ~ 2011 and during a 4 year period the prices for wind already overturned all other sources apparently . 
   but you do n't face death threats if you criticise christian religion . 
  i do n't face death threats for criticising islamic religion either . 
  if i am a journalist and write about what a douchebag jesus was you bet your ass i am going to get some [ death threats ] ( http://moralcompassblog.com/2013/04/02/step-on-jesus-prof-on-leave-after-death-threats/ ) . 
   yeah if you 're educated and do n't believe in a child fucking prophet you 're welcome in most parts of germany . 
  i mean if you are not educated and believe in child fucking priests you are no minority here . 
  deportation laws are the same for everyone , people that get refused will stop getting the `` benefits '' of asylum seekers ( no support whatsoever ) and be `` asked to leave or else ... '' and most comply . 
   except they burn their passports and identities on their way in to prevent just that . 
  that 's not gon na help , unless you have a passport you will never get a residence permit in germany . 
  also the german authorities will try to find out the nationality and can even force asylum seekers to go to the embassy of `` likely home countries '' to be checked there , if they want to bring their families they definitely have to admit to their nationality eventually . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.asyl.net/fileadmin/user_upload/beitraege_asylmagazin/am2004-10-05-hoffmann.pdf ) ( german ), 
  [ read this ] ( http://www.asyl.net/fileadmin/user_upload/beitraege_asylmagazin/am2004-10-05-hoffmann.pdf ), 
  in germany they get no funds , no social security , no work permits . 
  ** some ** go underground , ** most ** go somewhere else on their own . 
  the german law actually makes a clear distinction between people that have to leave and people you deport . 
   which also happen to be most secular countries that 's what i was saying , christianity has nothing to do with the legalization of gay marriage , nothing .
