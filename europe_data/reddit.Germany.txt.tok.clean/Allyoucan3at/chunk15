  some communities do n't even allow their priests to marry ( catholics one of the largest christian communities ) . 
  christianity is not `` better '' than islamism . 
  in undeveloped countries religion plays a bigger part and many of these countries are more backwards ( correlation ) . 
  the second anyone starts to see their opinion as the only truth there is , shit is going to happen and that holds true for all ideologies . 
   may show me any valid source of your claims , otherwise it 's again , just a theory, 
  no he said it should probably be oppressed because many muslims tend to agree with extremists , which was then backed in this thread by a poll that actually showed no direct causation from islamism . 
  muslims mostly disagree with [ suicide bombing ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-overview-13.png ) and extremism :  in a majority of countries surveyed , at least half of muslims say they are somewhat or very concerned about religious extremism . 
  i really do n't get how / r/europe can be so bipolar , over [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/06/london-woman-charged-over-alleged-killallwhitemen-tweet ) many call for `` freedom of speech at all cost '' and here many are like `` fuck freedom of religion they are just violent , backwards , fuckwits '' i have to assume it 's just two different `` groups '' that are being vocal here . 
  i doubt renewables will at any time be the only power source , because they ca n't be and they need infrastructure , correct . 
  but exactly the things you point out are likely going to be driving factors in tomorrows economy , i just think it ca n't hurt to improve the availability of them . 
  you can get years of jail time for downloading music in germany . . technically . 
  prison sentences are rarely as hard as they are initially stated , i doubt she will be getting any jail time . 
  how so ? 
  you mean stuff like [ this ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-overview-11.png ) ? 
  while that 's true the decentralization is minimizing this problem and storage facilities like pumping stations and large area batteries grow to be more efficient by the day . 
  also you can just generate more power than needed at any given time and `` waste it '' ( or sell it ) for no deficit as it did n't cost you resources to produce it in the first place . 
  there will always be some wind or some sun in a 400.000 km \u00b2 country . 
  pffft oceans do that for millions of years already , do n't play the victim card here !, 
  energy can have many different forms , heat , potential , kinetic , electric and we need to `` generate '' ( you ca n't generate energy just convert it ) many different forms of it to function . 
  i think that 's what he is talking about . 
   are there any ideologies that have uniform views among their adherents ? 
  because you seem to be arguing that if any adherents disagree , then the ideology is non-violent . 
  under the criteria you set , does nazism qualify as an ideology that causes violence ? 
  just go through [ this ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/ ) quickly and you will see why i think it 's wrong to assume islamism is inherently violent . 
  what i am saying is that in large parts of the world an overwhelming majority of the religion is non-violent and opposes extremism , thus you ca n't claim inherent violence . 
   controlled experiments are not possible in the realm of the social sciences . 
  you ca n't prove causation , so you just go ahead and assume it ? 
  if you ca n't prove something you should n't state is as fact , but as theory , because then that 's what it is . 
  blair clearly did n't paint the whole picture here just as so many others do n't and i just think that 's unfair . 
  [ this research ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/ ) sheds some more light on the topic and clearly outlines that nations supporting islam as main religion are more prone to sharia law supporters . 
  also surprisingly shows that south-east asia is generally more `` extreme '' than even the middle east . 
  i think it does n't hurt anyone to just look over these numbers , really cleared up some misconceptions for me . 
  edit : a few things i found interesting : [ on suicide bombing ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-overview-13.png )  in a majority of countries surveyed , at least half of muslims say they are somewhat or very concerned about religious extremism . 
  [ on religious freedom and democracy ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-overview-16.png )  additionally , u.s. muslims are much less likely than muslims worldwide to say that all or most of their close friends are muslim ( 48 % vs. global median of 95 % ) . 
  so much fore `` they do n't want to integrate at all ''  however , american muslims are somewhat less likely to believe in evolution than are muslims in other parts of the world ( 45 % vs. global median of 53 % ) . 
  indeed , when it comes to evolution , u.s. muslims are closer to u.s. christians ( 46 % of whom say they believe in evolution ) than they are to fellow muslims elsewhere in the world . 
  now if that is n't assimilation i do n't know what is :p, 
   so what further information would you need in order to prove causation ? 
  well you need to test the theory under different conditions to determine a causation , it 's a common thing to do in any scientific area . 
  you need to prove that a majority of muslims living under different conditions share the same views and that 's simply not the case . 
  this is already shown in [ this graph ] ( https://i.imgur.com/cyx54f8.png ) ( taken from the top comment in this thread ) . 
  the koran surely has stories that support extremism , so does the bible and the thora . 
  as i said extremism is not exclusive to or inherent in islamism and the other way around . 
  hard to say , it 's probably a combination of a lot of factors and differs from nation to nation . 
  indonesia has pretty strict rules on everything ( drug possession is punishable by death even for tourists ) . 
  pakistan is a safe haven for extremist groups since the 80 's and in constant conflict with india , but i honestly do n't know enough about any of the countries to make an educated judgement , especially egypt really surprised me actually . 
   i feel like that 's already something good about christianity . 
  that has absolutely nothing to do with christianity . 
  it 's the secular nations we built in europe that support free speech and gay marriage , not the church . 
  the last people condemned gay marriage , abortion and contraception of any kind . 
  there are extremists in every religion that cherry pick the teachings of their religions and go about oppressing and killing others . 
  [ a large part of christians ] ( http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/is-indiana-that-controversial-poll-finds-americans-support-religious-freedom-laws-16735/ ) would also prefer religious laws to be above state/federal laws . 
   it `` only '' radicalized later particularly after or with the help of western and eastern civilization 's `` involvement '' . 
  well it 's the old correlation = causation fallacy . 
  islam itself is not directly responsible for extreme views and practices . 
  every religion , political party , football team and ethnicity has those , that does n't mean you should oppress whole groups for the views and actions of few . 
  [ https://i.imgur.com/cyx54f8.png] ( https://i.imgur.com/cyx54f8.png ) these numbers also let me doubt that there is a direct correlation between these islamic extremists ' values and muslims in general . 
  turkey has a major muslim population and is way more moderate than many other countries . 
  the problem is not the religion itself , it 's what the people make of it . 
  and if stoning and whipping is part of your legal system then you are more prone to accept and support that . 
  is there any real threat she actually might get jail time ? 
  i did n't see anything in the article and do n't know about british law . 
  i agree that jail time for such a stupid thing is overreacting , but i still think punishment is in order . 
  there were cases in germany/austria where employees lost their job because the company did n't want to be associated with people that spew racist death wishes on social media and i think that is perfectly fine . 
   at this point in history in germany , if people could say whatever they want about jews , you think it would lead to some kind of violence ? 
  germans are so aware of all this , i ca n't believe it would happen again . 
  am i just naive ? 
  at this point in history no western country would do anything even closely resembling what happened in the 30 's and 40 's ( not only germany was `` jew-unfriendly '' ) so i do agree that it would n't happen again even if we abolished all the denazification laws . 
  however i simply think that inciting violence on someone or a group of people hurts the freedoms of that person/group and thus should be punished accordingly . 
  death threats for example . 
  this particular case is blown out of proportion but i think a decent fine together with her stepping down from an office she is clearly not fitted for is appropriate . 
  oh i do n't doubt that a lot of people in turkey hold true to the official course , just as many a right-wing german still denies the holocaust ( or play it down as much as possible ), 
   they have no way of making it happen and no real precedent to believe they 'll try it ever heard of genocide ? 
  the armenian genocide ? 
  history tells us over and over that racist comments like this can turn to real dangers . 
  this time that may not be the case , but you ca n't differentiate just because she called to kill a majority instead of a minority . 
  so snowden or every other whistleblower were completely free to give out government secrets and they did n't prosecute them at all for that . 
   it 's not the countries that can dictate that . 
  freedom of speech is a fundamental human right , much like the right of life is . 
  a violation of it goes past national boundaries and becomes an international concern , much like torture and other human rights abuses are . 
  also the usa apparently does n't recognize the human right for life as the death penalty is still practised within their border , guess we have an international concern here . 
  most human rights will be suspended once they violate other human rights or public order , it 's simply not right to call for genocide or even murder and everyone doing so should be prosecuted , yes he has free speech but everyone else has the right to life and dignity so which one is more `` right '' ? 
   you could probably convince them that the armenian genocide was n't real genocide the turkish government is still convinced [ it never was ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_denial ) so ... 
  this happens every day in any online based company . 
  people try to find loopholes not to pay for stuff wherever they can and the indirect payment methods a lot of online retailers allow is making it easier too . 
  i know about a local company here that sell europe wide and especially customers in switzerland use a `` loophole '' that makes it really hard to go against them legally ( as you can only do so through swiss officials and that is really expensive and complicated ) so they just order to switzerland with a delayed payment option and never come through . 
  but that 's an issue any company has that offers credit payment . 
  i 'm not apologizing for anyone , just take everything with a little more moderation . 
  `` terrorist '' has a very specific definition and even political islamism is n't worthy of the term terrorism . 
  not that i would agree with any of their values or world views , but i do value our rights to free religion , speech and political orientation . 
   they have said they do n't differentiate between islamist groups , a terrorist is a terrorist . 
  yeah but believing in allah does n't make you a terrorist . 
  most of assad 's army would be terrorists themselves by that logic . 
  putin is supporting assad for one reason and one reason only and that is influence . 
  he does n't want to lose his port , that 's all . 
  in case of popularity they would probably also have to compete with the palestine assassins of 72 . 
  i do n't think the raf got that much exposure outside of germany/western europe tbh . 
  the quality of life also decreased after the soviet union collapsed and look at those states now ( compared to then ) . 
  sure short term they suffered . 
  in the long term an independent economy can also act better than an oppressed one .
