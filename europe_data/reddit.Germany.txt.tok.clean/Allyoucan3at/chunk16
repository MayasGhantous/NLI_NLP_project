  well it 's reddit/the internet for you , everyone who does n't even have the slightest of ideas about anything can just state their opinions and sell them as facts . 
  i understand why politicians do n't take the internet that seriously , i mean it 's a great platform for recreational activities but if you want to discuss politically interesting topics you are either limited to specific groups or face 90 % idiots and ignorants in every discussion . 
  official numbers talk about [ 250.000 up to the end of august ] ( https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/statistik-anlage-teil-4-aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) you can expect new numbers this week probably as they are announced monthly . 
  research does suggest though that if the unbalance between two regions is great a better economy in the lower region tends to lead to more migration . 
  however migration = / = asylum so we just have to adjust our migration policies . 
   there will , unfortunately , always be hate . 
  hate for everything different . 
  there is a clear path towards tolerance and it 's called exposure . 
  people who experience different cultures are more tolerant towards them . 
  `` der bauer frisst nur was er kennt '' ( the farmer only eats the shit he knows ), 
  they would be even worse shitholes but we could shot anyone trying to leave , so there 's that . 
   an average of four to eight what kind of number is that ? 
  that 's not an average , that 's a guesstimate . 
  it 's not about asking them , it 's about policies and i can tell you that many balkan refugees were kicked out after the war ended . 
  they can obtain german citizenship just like anybody else with a decent job and 5 years residency can , but they ca n't just `` choose '' to stay here once their country is deemed safe again . 
  there is already a refugee commission from the un , the [ unhcr ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home ) . 
  i agree that it would be hard to get everyone to accept quotas like this , but no treaty up until now was signed by every nation and still , many did a great deal to improve our world . 
  also : water is liquid and fire is hot . 
   it 's ~ ~ hilarious ~ ~ tragic that people believe stuff like this . 
  ftfy, 
  you burn a lot of calories when shivering in the cold , 
  sorry , could n't resist :p, 
   why did you want me to link you the law if you 're just not going to read it . 
  i hate when people do that - . - they just do n't want to see the truth and make you jump through hoops just to show everyone how much of an idiot they were before . 
   okay , so they can block facebook . 
  that is exactly what zuckerberg does n't want to have and thus he complies . 
   things fall scientifically proven to not be the case for all things and very dependant on their environment . 
   rain is wet rain is only wet once you feel it , otherwise it 's just liquid . 
   fire ignites dry paper depending on the initial temperature of the paper , fun fact , antarctica is considered the largest desert on earth because it 's so dry . 
  it was the whole eu that agreed to the refugee treaties of 1951 and that just means we will have to process everyone and take everyone eligible for asylum in that knocks on our door . 
   call it what you want . 
  if someone decides what i have to do with my property , it is not really my property anymore . 
  then you ca n't own property in any country . 
  every country has legislation on what you can do with your property . 
  you ca n't just open a store in a residential building , you ca n't just build a skyscraper in a small town , in some places you ca n't even paint your roof green . 
  that 's a good thing though . 
   unfortunately the first country of asylum principle comes right from the 1952 refugee convention well the article does n't specifically state anything about that really . 
   the contracting states shall ** not ** impose penalties on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 it just says that people entering your country illegally shall not be punished , it leaves some wiggle room saying  refugees who , ** coming directly ** from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 but the punishment of people passing through a country first is not specified and thus up to the country to decide . 
  but i totally agree with you !, 
  the whole dublin agreements are what really got us into this messed up situation in the first place . 
  it was simply not designed or flawed in the first place to deal with this huge influx . 
  are you insane ? 
  italy has been asking for help about this for years already [ june ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9560982/the-invasion-of-italy/ ) [ june ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/we-will-hurt-eu-if-migrant-crisis-is-not-fixed-says-italian-pm-matteo-renzi ) [ june ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/migration-wave-overwhelms-italy/a-17705677 ) germany 's statement about suspending the dublin agreement was in [ august ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11821822/germany-drops-eu-rules-to-allow-in-syrian-refugees.html ) just stop trying to skew facts already , you do n't fool anyone , but yourself and you just look like an idiot that is not capable of researching or comprehending facts for himself . 
  you just blamed germany , that application processes in italy took so long because they do n't allow asylum applications in their embassies and when i tell you that they actually tried to relieve application processes times in italy you blamed them for incentivizing refugees to `` illegally '' travel through europe ? 
  just get your head out of your ass already . 
  hahaha this has to be the funniest thing i have ever read on this topic . 
  dude your article directly references my source !, 
  ( which you obviously did n't read at all ) from your article :  professor christian dustmann , of ucl 's centre for research and analysis of migration , and a co-author of the report from my [ source ] ( http://www.cream-migration.org/files/fiscalej.pdf )  christian dustmann and tommaso frattini also  immigrants from non-eea countries , on the other hand , contribute less than they receive ; however , this outcome is similar , albeit larger in magnitude , to natives and this is only true for non-eea immigrants pre-1999 ( as stated in the report , just read the conclusion it 's enough really ) , which includes most of eastern europe as many countries only joined in the 2000 's . 
   with respect to the recently arrived immigrant populations , those who came to the uk after 1999 , our analysis suggests that -- rather than being a drain on the uk 's fiscal system -- they have made ** substantial net contributions ** to its public finances , a reality that contrasts starkly with the view often maintained in public debate . 
  these findings for recent immigrants change little even when our computations of net contributions calculate the apportioning coefficients under different assumptions . 
  this conclusion is further supported by the probability of these immigrants ' receiving tax credits and benefits being lower than that of natives this paragraph is especially interesting to my point . 
  substantial net gain for the system while local residence still have a net drain on the system . 
  this study actually answers most of your questions about , what and how immigrates and how they affect the economy of the country , but i guess that did n't fit your agenda or you did n't read it at all and just trusted a simple news article 's agenda , that funnily referenced the exact same source . 
   refugees from the current regions are not good for the economy , they cost a lot of money , far more than they produce in their lifetime . 
  which should be no surprise , we help refugees out of charity , not for economic gain . 
  i generally agree , that refugees build different circumstances than immigrants . 
  however , once the conflicts in those countries end or rather are deemed safe again , refugees will have to go and the only thing that stays are then immigrants . 
  so while we surely wo n't necessarily benefit from it in the short term , their contributions in the longer term can surely be beneficial . 
  what it undisputedly does is raise the gdp , for whatever that 's worth . 
   that immigration has fueled u.s. macroeconomic growth is both uncontroversial and unsurprising -- more total workers yield more total output . 
  so yea refugees will cost us some money , but the immigrants that stay will likely benefit us . 
  btw , also from your article a person unrelated to the source :  david hanson , the shadow immigration minister , said : `` this report shows that immigration since 2001 has contributed to the public finances as well as to the economy . '', 
   because those countries do n't allow it . 
  that 's because of the dublin treaty , everyone in the eu signed . 
   blame germany for not allowing people to apply for asylum at embassies abroad . 
  no one does this ... so why do you single out germany ? 
  germany was actually the only country that allowed refugees to apply in germany instead of sending them back to italy , hungary , greece and everyone blamed them for that too even though this too was accepted in the dublin treaties ( voluntarily ), 
   are you really comparing the logistics of housing density in italy with mars ? 
  stop trying to discredit what i say by misinterpreting me . 
   you do so willingly knowing the possible living conditions . 
  then why are they not allowed to apply in a country they actually want to go to and that can offer proper living conditions ? 
  you are basically saying `` yes you can have asylum , but you will have to sleep in tents with thousands more , not be able to work , wait patiently for months until we process you and better be grateful for it ! '', 
  i really wish you never come into a situation like that , i doubt you would be able to deal with it . 
  i do agree with that . 
  although research even suggests that immigration is indeed beneficial to local economies . 
  [ public pensions and immigration policy in a democracy ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00118653 )  the expected lifetime income of each generation can be increased by applying a rule of steady immigration . 
  [ immigration 's economic impact ] ( http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/cea/cea_immigration_062007.html )  our review of economic research finds immigrants not only help fuel the nation 's economic growth , but also have an overall positive effect on the income of native-born workers . 
  [ the fiscal effects of immigration to the uk ] ( http://www.cream-migration.org/files/fiscalej.pdf )  rather than being a drain on the uk 's fiscal system -- they have made substantial net contributions to its public finances , a reality that contrasts starkly with the view often maintained in public debate . 
   we thus conclude that the recent wave of immigrants , those who have arrived in the uk since 2000 and driven the stark increase in the uk 's foreign born population , have contributed far more in taxes than they have received in benefits . 
  those are western funded studies that all show an overall positive trend from immigration . 
  of course this situation is a bit different as most of them are refugees and not classical immigrants , but still there is no real reason to believe they are going to `` drain '' our welfare systems . 
   most asylum applications should be handled within a few months though . 
  well usually , yes . 
  right now the waiting periods are months or even years in the border countries because of a huge influx . 
  caging people for months into refugee centres in economically not so well off countries is just breeding ground for trouble, 
  that 's pretty simply explained , by demographics and the time it takes for the education of a `` financial worker '' . 
  it will take time to bring them to our educational levels anyhow , so it would be better to have more young people that can get compatible degrees than to have middle aged business men that ca n't apply their degree here ( even if they have one ) . 
  so being forced in a room together with 20.000 other people for months on end is not a problem ? 
  you know why nasa did n't send anyone to mars yet ? 
  because the major issue is that you would have to push together at least 5 people into a tiny capsule for ~ 1 year . 
  not any technical limitations , i mean we sent 2 cars up there already . 
  it is simply no condition to live in for an extended period of time . 
  why is it a ** punishment ** for criminals to spend a period of time in an enclosed area with other people providing food and shelter for them and it is a saint 's act to do the same to refugees ? 
  yea that 's a problem with legislation and execution of policies rather than an inherent problem of refugees though . 
  `` you do n't have the political will to deport them so we should n't let anyone in '' is no argument . 
   the fox news video was cherry picking . 
  there are loads of other videos , many of which have been on this subreddit , to pick from . 
  certainly true . 
  i did n't get the vibe from this video that he was calling out all media , he just drew attention to the fact that sometimes these reports have a very strong agenda and one should reflect . 
  he did n't emphasize enough here how important reflecting is though .
