   his claims about scientifically proven immigration are from news articles . 
  that 's hardly trustworthy in and of itself , regardless of reputation . 
  true , too many journalists just rely on the opinion of more journalists instead of researching this stuff for themselves . 
  that does n't necessarily discredit the source entirely , but rather the journalist . 
   it is clear that he 's implying that the refugees from syria , etc , are the net positive immigration spoken of . 
  which is a fair assumption , why would this particular group of immigrants be different to so many others ? 
  if studies show that generally immigration is beneficial ( hypothetically undisputed ) then i would also assume the current group is beneficial too unless there is strong evidence that this specific group has traits that are widely accompanied by economic disadvantage which they do n't . 
   it bugged me , so i found one article [ 1 ] which sourced a controversial paper . 
  plenty of news papers gave figures between a net contribution of 20 bn # and a net loss of 120 bn # by immigrants over a decade . 
  i think this specific article is not really considering the core issue . 
  it is undisputed that to provide the infrastructure for immigration especially for refugees , you will need to spend money . 
  but whether or not this money will find its way back into the economy is the question here . 
  britain may be investing 120bil , they are not spending them . 
   non-eea receives more in benefits than they contribute . 
  that is , correctly , much like the natives , however the non-eea immigrants are mostly working age people . 
  they attribute it to the many children they get , but while it is certainly a factor , i disagree on this point . 
  i would personally like to see a net loss/benefit when compared according to age groups . 
  i just read over the conclusion quickly and while your statement is true for pre 2000 immigrants this is said about people arriving afterwards . 
   we thus conclude that the recent wave of immigrants , those who have arrived in the uk since 2000 and driven the stark increase in the uk 's foreign born population , have contributed far more in taxes than they have received in benefits . 
  moreover , by sharing the cost of fixed public expenditures ( which account for more than 14 % of total public expenditure ) , they have reduced the financial burden of these fixed public obligations for natives . 
  in fact , we estimate considerable implicit savings on these expenditures -- just short of # 24 billion between 2001 and 2011 overall i think it seems to be improving in recent years but the reasons for that are unclear . 
  they also mention that these numbers are only to be corrected in favour of the immigrants once more factors are considered . 
  so i think in the end the conclusion can be that there is at least no evidence that they `` drain '' the welfare system or the economy . 
   this leads me to question just which type of immigration that counts as benefiting europe in 19 out of 20 cases . 
  i 'll speculate that non-eea immigration is not the one . 
  i doubt they made the distinction in those studies and since many european nations have a majority of immigrants from non-eea countries i think your assumption is at least disputable . 
   if he did not know , then he was simply ignorant . 
  i would wager that 's the case , as stated above journalists tend to not do work twice and rely on their colleagues so he ( or his team ) probably did n't even read through the articles or the sources . 
  i do n't really think that is necessary though . 
  you also have to take for granted that newton knew what he was doing without having to reinvent calculus or read all his books . 
  and if 19/20 publications tell you global warming is a fact then you can safely assume it is too . 
  we both do n't really know how much research they did , i can just tell you that from mine own i came to a similar conclusion . 
  if you care for more articles on the topic , i did some research myself . 
  i know these articles may not be the best representation , it 's what i could come up with without access to research libraries , i will try again next week when i have access to my university again . 
  but the abstracts already paint a somewhat clear picture . 
  [ public pensions and immigration policy in a democracy ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00118653 ) [ immigration 's economic impact ] ( http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/cea/cea_immigration_062007.html )  there must be order . 
  the law must be upheld . 
  the dublin agreements in particular . 
  agree with the first part , but the dublin treaty is what got us into trouble in the first place . 
  i think it was absurd to expect hungary to process all these people in a reasonable time and you also ca n't expect hundreds of thousands of refugees to just sit there for months or even years without being allowed to work in a country that is financially and organization wise not able to cope with them anyway . 
  imo it would be way easier to distribute them among 28 states of which many are much better prepared for these people . 
   we can then work on quotas for the sake of solidarity with the border countries . 
  well we tried that already , did n't we . 
  what if we never find common ground on this ? 
  how long will they be held in the border countries ? 
  or do the border countries have to care for them ? 
  what if they really ca n't ? 
  dublin did n't solve any of this and we surely need a solution for it anyway . 
   countries are self-determining . 
  we can not force , or threaten with sanctions , countries which do not participate . 
  while that 's true , politics is always about that `` pressure '' one country wants to have something done and offers something in return . 
  i agree that sanctioning will only lead to more serious trouble for the eu though as eventually some countries will not abide ( and should n't ) . 
   we can not reward refugees who lie about their origins and identity . 
  i do n't think we do . 
  the only problem is that we ca n't deport them , but it is certainly not advantageous for them to not identify themselves , because that hinders the process of actually identifying someone and if it ca n't be determined at all he also wo n't get refugee status . 
  so i do n't really see that as a problem as we have policies fighting this . 
  ** tl ; dr ** sorry for the long write . 
  in part i agree with you , but i think you are setting the bar a bit too high for a entertaining news program . 
  when fact checking i could n't find any blatant errors in their logic , but i agree there was an agenda , which is not necessarily a bad thing . 
  also even if it turns out to be false and these refugees indeed do cost us some of our benefits , i would be willing to share some of my wealth to help out 800.000 refugees , even though i do n't expect anyone else to do so . 
  he actually makes that distinction a couple of times mentioning `` migrants and refugees '' and many refugees will end up as migrants , i do n't think it 's done on ill intent , but i agree the distinction should be made . 
  anti-themselves would solve a lot of problems i guess . 
  you keep posting to dutch websites that does n't help me at all because my dutch knowledge is based on interpreting words that are related to german ... and as far as i can tell that article talks about the direct costs for social security , not about their economic impact in the future , but please proof me wrong with a translation . 
  you have to compare numbers of criminality to local averages not whole federal states with millions of inhabitants . 
  sure `` immigrants '' are 2.6 times more likely to commit crimes , but they are also 2.6 times more likely to get rejected in a job interview and 2.6 times more likely to live in crime infested ghettos in big cities . 
  those numbers mean nothing without any reference . 
  also these statistics usually include non-residents as well , so tourists , business travellers , illegal immigrants , etc. 
  as my sources from competent german news outlets suggest , there is no conclusive evidence that immigrants are in fact more violent or criminal than locals . 
  none . 
   you just hand-wave them away with the silliest excuses like `` but they 've only been there for 40 years !, 
  of course it 's only logical they 're unemployed still !, 
  and of course it 's only logical their kids are at the top of the crime statistics ! '' . 
  plenty more statistics show that immigrants adjust everything to local levels over 1-2 generations , so of course it is relevant how long they are here . 
   you keep coming with statistics from the us which has absolutely no similarity to these immigration waves they are not immigration waves but refugee waves , just to make that clear and , yes they do . 
  immigration is not uniform that is true , neither is economy , but they both follow general patterns and i cited american sources because they seem to be more prevalent , if you find european sources that say anything different , be my guest . 
   yeah , some might open a restaurant but most of them wo n't , and they will live of multiple welfare benefits and cost a lot of money . 
  no they wo n't all open restaurants , some will open software companies or drive buses around town . 
  why do you think they are inherently more `` lazy '' than locals to get jobs ? 
  again if you have more people , you need more buses , trains , schools , companies to produce goods , etc. 
  the economy is not static . 
  so even if many of them do n't get jobs , they still produce them for locals that are willing to work so eagerly . 
   `` source '' after citing wikipedia ... sigh, 
  living in a camp in italy for 4 years waiting for your processing not being able to work is unacceptable, 
   critic against merkel 's horrible way to handle the situation equals now xenophobic against refugees ? 
  are you sirious ? 
  why is everyone immediately victimizing himself when someone does n't agree with their views ? 
  i said  everyone blames the refugees or merkel , depending on how xenophobic people are . 
  big xenophobic -  blame refugees small xenophobic -  blame merkel  with proper visa processes in place many more people could have applied , checks be done and the most weak peoples , whole families , people who have family here already , could have been picked first . 
  total legal , cheap and safe trip . 
  but what we rather did was to let these strong enough to survived the dangerous trip and arrive here illegal first enter . 
  and only them . 
  yes that 's exactly my point when i say  the problem here is the eu 's refugee/immigration policy you ca n't apply for asylum in embassies for example , so you ** have ** to travel to the eu in order to do so . 
  you would also have to apply for visas if you want to get in legally , which you will not be granted without having a workplace here . 
  it has been the policy of europe for a long time to make it as hard as possible to get refugee status in the eu in order to keep the influx low , but that also caused most of the major issues we have right now ... 
  less likely than what or who ? 
   he takes on the concerns of many people and debunks some `` facts '' about immigrants as flukes and points out the scientifically proven benefits of immigration . 
  just as i said, 
  there are extremist turks and there are secular saudis , generalizing every turk as better than every saudi is just bullshit . 
  goes to show how much `` being muslim '' actually means . 
  people just like to have an escapegoat for . . something ?
