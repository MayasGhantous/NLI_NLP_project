  so they pick the next best target . 
  in the 20s it was jews today it 's muslims unless they lived here for 50 years then it 's k. 
  still no source , while i can provide you with multiple : [ public pensions and immigration policy in a democracy ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00118653 )  the expected lifetime income of each generation can be increased by applying a rule of steady immigration . 
  [ the economic sociology of immigration ] ( http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781610444521/ )  mark granovetter illustrates how small businesses built on the bonds of ethnicity and kinship can , under certain conditions , flourish remarkably well . 
  and again us government : [ immigration 's economic impact ] ( http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/cea/cea_immigration_062007.html )  our review of economic research finds immigrants not only help fuel the nation 's economic growth , but also have an overall positive effect on the income of native-born workers . 
  this is western funded research by economists and governmental organs and you keep telling me  there 's not a single economist worth his salt who 's going to say that these immigrants will create more jobs that are worth more than all those others who live from welfare will cost . 
  you should stop being so delusional and just accept some facts . 
  no one has to take any refugee skydiving , but before you generalize them and judge them on a few secluded news paper articles about `` sharia law being enforced in europe '' you should really check some facts and reflect on them before just labelling them all as human trash and unfit for society in your mind . 
  i meant they revolt against their own families ( for good reason ) because they see how unoppressed women live in western countries while they themselves are/feel oppressed . 
  if that sentence caused any confusion i am sorry , i am not a native speaker so to me some things surely sound different than to others . 
  as stated it 's a principle , it was specifically added to the dublin agreements for example , that this particular principle can be suspended voluntarily by any state and germany did so in august this year . 
  as a principle , and not part of the human rights agreement , it is on a voluntary basis for countries to send these refugees back , that does n't take refugee status away from anyone . 
  i guess this was done to relieve some countries that are popular destinations for immigrants , like the us and most of europe so they can in return send the refugees back if they do n't want to have them . 
  this is a bit of an iffy principle imo , because it essentially `` punishes '' countries for being geographically closer to a war region . 
  what are you implying ? 
  that turks are the `` better '' muslims ? 
   only applies to refugees that have registered as such . 
  no dude , stop coming up with one blatant lie after the other just to push your agenda , it 's simply not true ... 
  i mean you could read the link i posted , but i guess that would be too much to ask , so here you go :  the 1951 convention protects refugees . 
  ** it defines a refugee as a person who is outside his or her country of nationality ** or habitual residence ; has a well-founded ** fear of being persecuted ** because of his or her race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ; and is unable or unwilling to avail him -- or herself of the protection of that country , or to return there , for fear of persecution ( see article 1a ( 2 ) ) . 
  ** people who fulfill this definition are entitled to the rights and bound by the duties contained in the 1951 convention . 
  ** nothing more , nothing less . 
  you wo n't get ** asylum ** if you do n't register as a refugee that much is correct , but what that entitles you to is bound by local law . 
  and ? 
  of course they have to abide the law . 
  well denazification was a clear path against a single ideology , you ca n't really do that with an internal group of a religion . 
  that would not only break certain constitutional and human rights , but is also very hard to pull off from the outside . 
  or did you mean embarrassing our executive organs by hiring some of the extremists to be double-agents only to be the worst of the bunch ? 
  i think there is a `` social '' way to do this , studies already show that women are causing trouble in these secluded families because they see the rights native women in the country have and want the same . 
  one way would be to help these women integrate into a society where they are free to choose their partner and make their own decisions without oppression whatsoever . 
  create social stations where they can go , maybe even bring back `` girl schools '' or just break school classes apart based on gender if only for some specific courses , employ female muslim teachers that adopted a certain lifestyle to show them , there is no shame in it , etc. , etc. 
  walls , rockets , iron domes , stuff like that you know . 
  4 million actually and until now i have never seen a mosque really , even though i know there is one in my town , no one forced me to go there or pray to mecca , kinda weird even though we are getting islamizised so badly over here . 
   and refusing to register as refugee makes you cease to be a `` refugee '' not really , no . 
  did you even read what it said in the comment ? 
  i mean it does n't help your point at all . 
  it says that even when entering ** illegally ** you are still a refugee , because you have a right ** not ** to be punished . 
   ** the right * not * to be punished ** for illegal entry into the territory of a contracting state ( article31 ) you ca n't just take away refugee status from someone because he is n't cooperative , it 's a human right . 
  you also ca n't gag someone because he says something you do n't want to hear ... 
   huge immigrant waves . 
  they are not immigrants , they are refugees !, 
  refugees are sent back to their home country once the conflict ends , europe will very much have the chance to pick and choose in the long run . 
  so stop comparing immigrants to refugees . 
   that only works if you carefully pick and choose who you let in . 
  that 's not even true , an economy can have all kinds of jobs and a syrian restaurant will create as many jobs as a german one or as any other company for that matter . 
   there 's not a single economist worth his salt who 's going to say that these immigrants will create more jobs that are worth more than all those others who live from welfare will cost . 
  keep living in that illusion while i already provided proof that they actually do ...  did you even read the source ? 
  it 's about previous refugee waves . 
  how long do you think they live in nl ? 
  somalian civil war started in the 1990 's so roughly 20 years . 
  ~ half a generation . 
  morocco - 1970s 40 years . 
  ~ one generation ( also one of the `` best '' groups ) iran , iraq , afghanistan all emerged after the 1980s conflicts in the region ending with unstable governments in the 1990s - 20 years . 
  ~ half a generation eritrea 2000 - 10 years ~ 1/4 generation now take turkish and polish most came from programs in the 1960s-70s or just right after the war so 50-60 years whole generation of course it takes time for them to assimilate , it 's simply not accurate , fair or representative to compare eritreans that arrived 10 years ago with to local residence , it is n't comparable . 
   yes it is , seeing as my first comment was an answer to someone asking if it would really be that bad if the population went down . 
  do you even have any idea what you are talking about anymore ? 
  and it still is n't how that works . 
  if you have less people you wo n't magically have more * educated * people . 
  if you want to create an automated industry with full employment you will have to educate your citizens not decimate them . 
   all the statistics show that both in the long and short term this kind of mass immigration is a strain on the economy . 
  i showed you a pretty clear example of an official government of the biggest economy in the world that immigration is actually beneficial and you keep telling me it 's not so , not showing any sources whatsoever . 
  it 's like playing chess with a pigeon , it knocks over all the pieces and claims it won the game . 
  i do n't know how i failed to see that abbreviation ... and to your point no it does absolutely not work like that !, 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/4ec262df9.html )  other rights contained in the 1951 convention include :  \u2022 the right not to be expelled , except under certain , strictly defined conditions ( article 32 ) ;  \u2022 the right not to be punished for illegal entry into the territory of a contracting state ( article31 ) ;  \u2022 the right to work ( articles 17 to 19 ) ;  \u2022 the right to housing ( article 21 ) ;  \u2022 the right to education ( article 22 ) ;  \u2022 the right to public relief and assistance ( article 23 ) ;  \u2022 the right to freedom of religion ( article 4 ) ;  \u2022 the right to access the courts ( article 16 ) ;  \u2022 the right to freedom of movement within the territory ( article 26 ) ; and  \u2022 the right to be issued identity and travel documents ( articles 27 and 28 ) . 
  specifically  \u2022 the right not to be punished for illegal entry into the territory of a contracting state ( article31 ) and  \u2022 the right to freedom of movement within the territory ( article 26 ) you could even argue that the `` territory '' involves the whole schengen area if you are inside the eu , so not even crossing borders would be illegal and even if it was , they would still be refugees according to a treaty everyone inside the eu abides to . 
  i see what you are getting at and i do agree , he surely does have an agenda here but it 's not really hidden . 
   german cabaret often has some subtle sense of self-irony . 
  well if i think of volker pispers or the zdf heute-show , i feel a similar vibe as oliver here . 
  i actually do n't think he omits anything that is a fact . 
  just because he does n't jump to conclusions about a whole group based on single events . 
  he specifically says that there is a potential risk , but the definite benefit ( that he backs up with facts , that are in return [ backed by the us government ] ( http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/cea/cea_immigration_062007.html ) ) outweighs those in his opinion . 
  migrants ** are not refugees ** those two are inherently different , the one chooses to leave his country , the other one has to fear for his life and runs . 
  immigration laws are also tight in europe , asylum laws however are the same for every person on the planet ( to some extent ) . 
   that 'll most likely explain the rather long wait . 
  one simple thing does already . 
  the fact the eu imposed regulations for refugees to be processed only in a few of the 28 member states , namely hungary , italy and greece . 
  of course these 3 countries ca n't cope with all the refugees while the others sit back and watch the show . 
  if you simply spread it out among all it 's going to go over way more smoothly , but that 's costly so we decide to let them walk there themselves . 
   no word of the altercations happening in german refugee camps . 
  most of these stories are reported perfectly well , just scan through  a lot of `` refugees '' actually would n't register as a refugee in the first safe country they entered and did n't want to register in hungary either and would n't leave the train . 
  no wonder if you had to [ wait until 2020 ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/turkey-other-refugees-languish-limbo-2014111083938134850.html ) to get processed in the first place ... 
  the eu policies are making it extremely difficult to legally get processed in the central countries . 
  that 's why most are moving there , because they do n't see and do n't have a chance in hungary or turkey even though they might be safe countries . 
   the abhorrent behaviour of no small amount of migrants i actually do think it is a small number . 
   would leave the hungarian police in a different light , would it not ? 
  no , just because someone steals from you does n't mean you can shoot him . 
  or one injustice is not outdone by another . 
  minus and minus only equals plus in maths and even there only multiplicatively . 
   there 's certainly more to it than most people would like you to believe , but no one can argue that lwt have spun quite the narrative . 
  [ what does a london tv station has to do with anything ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_weekend_television ) i seriously do n't know what you mean by lwt but i guess left-wing-something , anyhow , sure this is a very emotional debate , i try keeping it rational for the most part and only argue with facts , while the media tends to show you dead children 's bodies or raging arabs depending on their agenda . 
   is just absolutely retarded . 
  well i guess every economist on the planet is retarded then ... 
  i always thought that too , never though have i had proof , but now you opened my eyes . 
   it just is when more and more jobs are becoming redundant thanks to the advance of technology . 
  which has absolutely nothing to do with immigrants or refugees ... automatization surely is going to need a different social system , but that 's not the question here is it ? 
   the vast majority of them will end up living of welfare instead of paying taxes and contributing anything as the past refugee waves have proven . 
  the report itself says that the vast majority here are coming from a refugee background , you simply ca n't compare them to local residents when they lived half their live in a different country ... it 's also a very different sample size so comparing these statistics is not really a strong point . 
  of course immigration is n't going to pay off tomorrow , no one is disputing that and as i said before in the short term you have to invest to educate and integrate them in the long run you will only benefit . 
  edit :  and stop with the illusion that immigrants are a boon .
