  i purposefully made it broad , because everyone has different preferences . 
    i then pointed you to a site with a descriptive list of the bills before parliament , those may very well be acts at some point , if approved . 
   but they wo n't be , because that 's not how parliament works . 
  what ?? 
  what else do they do then ? 
  just sit around and jerk each other off ? 
  maybe you should have a look at [ this ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/ )  a bill is a proposal for a new law , or a proposal to change an existing law , presented for debate before parliament . 
  to quote from the link , maybe , in this case you do n't really seem to grasp the legislative system . 
   but that in no way means that 's going to be voted on or become a law . 
  no it does n't mean it ** has ** to be voted on , but ** only ** bills can be voted on by parliament and eventually become a law . 
  so i do n't see where i am in the wrong here for posting a list of ( possibly ) voted on bills in a discussion about current and future law ?!, 
  please elaborate . 
   a bill is unlikely to pass how is that relevant ? 
  a bill is the only way to impose new acts , so if you actually want to change legislation you have to propose a bill first . 
  therefore if you want to inform yourself about your countries politics , you have to look at which proposals are made to the parliament and those proposals are formed as bills . 
   the number of bills before parliament is n't even a valid criticism of the government because literally anyone in either house - be they a member of the government , the opposition or a crossbench peer - can introduce any bill they like without having to consult with the government . 
  i do n't even get how you read so much between the lines of what i wrote !? 
  i never ever criticized anyone in this comment chain !, 
  i simply supplied a list of bills , that 's all !, 
  you somehow seem to take offense to that , i would really like to know why !? 
   please , yes , because it 's not clear exactly what the criticism is here . 
  where do you read criticism ? 
  the only criticism i had was towards your manner of replying to a simple link i provided . 
  but here : [ list of uk public general acts ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga ), 
  the poster above you was edging people to look up what their parliament is about to vote on and while doing so , not to rely on condensed news articles but to fully inform themselves about the topic . 
  you then specifically quoted the section about the sources not being the media , but the actual laws ** and how they pass them ** asking a question that could lead one to believe you were requesting access to information about `` the laws and how they pass them '' . 
  i then pointed you to a site with a descriptive list of the bills before parliament , those may very well be acts at some point , if approved . 
  if you want me to point you to the actually imposed laws at the moment i am willing to provide that as well . 
  i do n't think i have expressed an issue with any bill or the way they are passed neither did i imply that bills before parliament represent `` the law '' . 
  i am also well aware of the workings of the legislative system . 
  i am rather confused about the aggressiveness with which i am met for simply providing an answer to a question you seemed to impose . 
  i am deeply sorry if i misinterpreted your comment . 
  [ maybe this ? 
  ] ( http://services.parliament.uk/bills/ ), 
  well do you think insulting fat people should be punished ? 
  i think insulting anyone should be punished ( based on severity of course ) and [ it actually is ] ( https://dejure.org/gesetze/stgb/185.html ) . 
  i would assume that 2nd/3rd gen are `` better integrated '' because they grew up here with the societies customs and habits . 
  it 's not uncommon for these generations to feel the need to reestablish a connection with their forefathers culture/homeland and i do n't even think there is anything wrong with that . 
  my ancestors were from the austro-hungarian empire and i feel a connection to the regions they were from and the culture they had . 
  you can also type them if you have a numpad on your keyboard , just hold alt while typing the following combinations on your numpad : * 132 for \u00e4 * 142 for \u00c4 * 148 for \u00f6 * 153 for \u00d6 * 129 for \u00fc * 154 for \u00dc * 225 for \u00df, 
  you mean tinder ? 
  even worse, 
   ~ ~ than an educated immigrant ~ ~ anyone who has $ 300,000 . 
  could just as well be any terrorist organization or who knows what . 
  if you got the money , nobody cares if you are educated or not . 
  sure , i just thought the article made it pretty clear the raids related to this incident only occurred in the states of schleswig-holstein and lower saxony . 
  there have been multiple people detained in the past months based on terror/is allegations all over germany , that 's true . 
  just saying in this case the 2 incidents are probably not related . 
  from the article :  the men - aged between 17 and 26 - were detained after a series of pre-dawn raids in the states of schleswig-holstein and lower saxony on tuesday . 
  wiesbaden is in hesse , guess it was something different . 
  [ checks out for me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ty4ysof.png ) largely depends on how you phrase the question , drop the `` die '' and you get something different . 
  one thing that i found in almost all of them though ( tried `` briten '' `` engl\u00e4nder '' w/o `` die etc ) was the question `` why are the british so ugly '', 
  governments also have to abide by current law . 
  they can change these laws , but still then they have to conform with the constitution and favouritism simply does n't, 
  so does the us and any other major army/airforce on the planet . 
  they are less complex to build and maintain , they are more fuel efficient and have preferable performance in low speed and high load environments . 
  turbo-props are by no means an indicator of antiquated technology . 
  whole heartedly agree with you . 
  pure anything is never the way to go , be it capitalism or socialism . 
  a mixture of the two seems to work best for the largest part of the population so i am glad i am living in a country practicing exactly that . 
   capitalism destroyed their economies in the first place . 
  i would argue imperialism did , not capitalism . 
  of course you can derive a cascading effect of capitalism , but in the long run it is going to help everyone regardless . 
  you can clearly see that in the [ numbers ] ( https://www.gapminder.org/tools/mountain ) . 
   imagine a farmer who had a farm in 19th century which was big enough to live on it . 
  and from time to time he had to buy some things on local market which would cost on average less then 1.9 $ / day . 
  imagine now a factory worker having salary , i do n't know , 4 $ / day , but he lived in a city , worked 12h daily in shitty conditions and he needed to spend 2 $ / day on rent and 2 $ / day on food . 
  nothing left for other stuff . 
  who 's poorer ? 
  well those are a lot of assumptions  the factory is inherently more effective at producing food than the farmer is . 
  this means you can support a way greater number of people with food without them having to actively work for it , which in return opens up the possibility for these people to work on something else , making the factory even more effective for example . 
  now the simple factory worker may not be more wealthy than the farmer , but the people he produces food for are . 
  general increase in gdp and wealth follow for the entire population . 
  of course when talking about poverty you have to factor in cost of living , that goes without saying . 
  but more wealth will always benefit you , even when your cost of living are at 0 . 
  but that was mostly cameron campaigning the whole time was n't it ? 
  i mean in the past he was scape goating the eu for everything bad happening instead of taking responsibility or trying to change things and then proposed a referendum he thought would not pass anyway to stay in power , which now bites him in the ass . 
  frankfurt is also a huge internet hub , meaning it is closer to the international market . 
  the eu is still largely an economical union , so of course it 's about the money . 
  the eu tries to collect money from member states to distribute it again to the contributing countries ( in its best interest ) and tries to establish a common market for everyone to access . 
  it 's everyones business in the eu if a major contributor leaves . 
  it means less money for the net drains and more to spend for the net contributors . 
   it 's not been reported on the news here yet it 's in the article ... unsourced , but still . 
   he may or may not of said it , it does n't matter right now , what matters is we think of her two young kids . 
  you can do both  her family surely will not ( even though the husband already said : `` to unite to fight against the hatred that killed her . '' ), 
  i think we should do exactly what you are trying to say and respect the families wish right now !, 
  i agree that `` low sample size '' is a misleading term in this case , i thought my point would come across anyway . 
  and again i am not trying to downplay the significance of these statistics , but i am saying you ca n't conclude anything from just one single statistic like that . 
  what i am trying to say is , that just because you happen to have a specific group overly represented in one years statistic does n't mean this specific group is especially prone to murder . 
  it could very well be a statistical anomaly . 
   i am going to ignore the nonsense that is equating murder with tax evasion . 
  see [ my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4o693t/perceived_muslim_population_vs_actual_muslim/d4a5wuo ), 
   muslims move around in large groups that scream the language so that everyone hears clearly the language for example in a bus . 
  while i never experienced that like ... ever ( i live close to a refugee center ) i agree with your sentiment . 
  people tend to notice things different from them more . 
   people living in the country see more areas full of muslims than people living in the cities exclusively white areas . 
  it 's probably more the other way around . 
  immigrants tend to settle in the cities , but mostly in more or less exclusive quarters . 
  you have one of those in your city and it seems/feels like a no-go for you to go/live there even if nothing bad would happen to you . 
  but again i agree with the sentiment .
