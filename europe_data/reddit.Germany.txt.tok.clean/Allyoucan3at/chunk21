  i was n't comparing murder to tax evasion , i 'll try to explain it better . 
  there is a statistic about everything : people who eat more meat live longer , people who eat more meat have cancer at earlier ages , people who eat more meat are more aggressive , people who eat more meat are more successful at fulfilling their dreams pick only one of those and you will have a certain kind of audience ( meat eaters vs meat haters ) same goes for everything else too , like muslims and murder rates or locals and tax evasion rates . 
  you have to look at the entire picture and not just one simple statistic that fits your agenda . 
   last time i checked , for instance , moroccans in spain are 1.5 % of the population and commit 18 % of the murders . 
  that 's one sure way to get noticed . 
  not trying to play it down here , but that 's a very low sample size ( 300 ) . 
  and that 's exactly one of the problems of news reporting . 
  you could probably pull a statistic about spaniards committing 100 % more crimes in certain areas than immigrants ( say tax evasion ) , but it 's a skewed statistic from the beginning . 
  most serious news stations do n't really bother with these statistics , which is one reason why they are heavily criticized right now . 
  muslims are over-represented in the media ( let 's leave out the why ) which is one reason why they seem over-represented in the population as well . 
  it 's always the questions what 's up for discussion i guess . 
  that 's why we have regional governments etc. 
  this simply shows that most people are not able to make educated decisions on topics concerning an entire country , which seems logical to me . 
  but that 's exactly the goal of this poll is n't it ? 
  it 's showing that people simply do n't comprehend the hole scale , but are more concerned with their immediate environment . 
  you could poll them on many other things to show that though . 
   media/public over-representation i think that is exactly what this is trying to show though . 
  people * think * there are way more muslims in their country because they are influenced by media and proximity bias . 
  does n't make their believes any more true though . 
  definitely bigger than his hands, 
  [ they did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asse_ii_mine ) but it seems just dumping it in a random mine is not going to cut it for the next 2.000.000 years the stuff is going to radiate . 
  how else would you fabricate a picture like this ? 
  that 's the best part about living in the south west . 
  nobody understands us , but we understand everyone ( including the bavarians ) . 
  i totally agree with you though , cities even a few kilometers apart have entirely different dialects . 
  thanks, 
  any source on that quote/story ? 
  i seemed to have completely missed it . 
  if you promise everything there is going to be something in there for everyone . 
  men are disproportionally targeted by laws against physical violence . 
  east !, 
  but this time , even further . 
  that 's not surprising . 
  politics , for many , is a polarizing issue . 
  you are either for eu/party/candidate a or against it . 
   you 're comparing the attitude of citizens towards immigrants to the attitude of the so-called `` first feminist government '' to their saudi masters . 
  no i 'm not . 
   i have to spell it out for you : our culture kills less people so it 's objectively better . 
  that 's objectively false . 
   since our culture reduces harm for us . 
  the idea of the head scarf/general concealment of women is also intended to reduce harm done to them , that 's at least a claim put up by many adversaries . 
   also , it 's not hypocritical at all because you 're comparing apples to oranges where am i comparing two different things ? 
  my statement was , that there are surely some people who think that we should expect other people to live by our standards if they come here and never theirs if we go there . 
  if that 's not hypocritical it 's arrogant at least . 
  which is n't apparent in your post at all, 
  something human can still be hypocritical . 
  hypocrites claim it is essential that people coming to other cultures should adopt their customs and accept their laws , however refuse to do so when they visit other cultures . 
   also modern swedish culture is clearly superior to iran 's backwater dictatorship . 
  from our point of view maybe . 
  the poster you commented to did . 
  some of which are hypocritical , which is my point . 
  so you think you should n't obey another countries laws if you are just visiting because you disagree with them ? 
  it 's interesting to see how many people want `` them to adopt to our culture and respect our rules '' yet , when something like this happens they call it a `` walk of shame '' . 
  granted it 's not exactly a comparable situation between refugees/migrants and political representatives , but the hypocrisy is still there . 
  i partially agree with you and painting erdogan as the next hitler is probably a bit too much , but there are some very strong ideological tendencies in the recent past , with britain/america first and erdogans shaping turkey to a complete autocracy . 
  i doubt any of this will lead to war and i agree that an arms race is simply idiotic . 
  but the conflict in ukraine at the very least should show you , that not all is so well and dandy as you make it out to be . 
  big scale war is out of the picture maybe , but the skirmishes and the simple threats for many countries is still a reality, 
  germany and the netherlands are in close cooperation as well [ a tank battalion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/414_panzer_battalion ) and [ a navy battalion ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/naval/2016/02/04/bundeswehr-sea-battalion-dutch-navy-integration/79845430/ ) are already mixed together and operate quite closely . 
  a european army is envisioned by many eu leaders which i would welcome very much . 
  i like the idea of countries without any army whatsoever , especially in europe as we really do n't need to defend our countries with force anymore , at least not in a classical militaristic way but to shield yourself against outside threats should be a target and bonding the eu to this goal might help especially the eastern countries as they are the ones at the most threat . 
  that may be part of the truth , there is underlying racism and culture exclusivity involved for sure , but we see in many if not all of these movements against immigrants the basic fear of `` them '' getting more than `` they deserve '' . 
  giving people financial and societal security through infrastructure and public services though is first never a bad idea and second it certainly helps with the feeling people have that immigrants get something granted `` for free '' while they do n't . 
  there is [ edrs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_data_relay_system ) and the whole optical communication projects i have actually been a part of . 
  this will allow leo-satellites to transmit data almost 24/7 which means live images of almost every place on earth , huge deal for earth observation . 
  esa achieved the first laser based communication in space and has been in a leading role in the technology actually [ melissa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melissa ) is a project to grow plants in space/0g . 
  i ca n't remember the name , but there was an effort to build a spacecraft to be launched from a modified tornado plane . 
  and the director general jan w\u00f6rner wants to build a [ moon-village ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/ministerial_council_2016/moon_village ) there is much much more , head over to / r/esa if you want to know specifics they are quite happy to answer questions there, 
  as a student i worked at esa for 6 months . 
  the amount of projects they had which where really cool and technologically advanced and also very important to our day-to-day lives i learned about is crazy . 
  they do a shitty job at marketing/pr , but i understand why . 
  the only projects ever to get any media attention is galileo , philae/rosetta and exomars . 
  my community built their own glass fiber network and telekom refused to service it \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  because it 's hardly relevant . 
  `` oh rape is bad '' `` but murder is worse '' let 's not ban rape then shall we ? 
  eye for an eye only works until everyone is blind . 
  but muh ' feelings !, 
  migrant crisis in a nutshell, 
   i very much doubt your claim . 
  check the source then !, 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/irbztaa.png ) i took a screenshot for you and will translate so you do n't have an excuse for simply dismissing facts because of your agenda . 
  the table shows the top 10 countries of origin for refugees in all of 2015 . 
  the names are in german but i am sure you can figure them out . 
  the important thing i want to point out is the `` ungekl\u00e4rt '' or unkown/unable to determine part here . 
  as you can see a total of 11 721 ( as i wrote before ) people whose country of origin could n't be determined applied for asylum in 2015 in germany . 
  a total of 441 889 people applied for asylum in 2015 in germany . 
  that makes it ~ 2.65 % of all cases . 
  [ for comparison ] ( http://imgur.com/zp8ozmh ) the figure from 2000 with 2.7 % of unkown/unable to determine . 
  conclusion : there are not many people whose country of origin is unknown for whatever reason . 
  there are no more people with unknown country of origin than at other points in history , no significant increase . 
  your assumption that people throw their passports away and are therefore not identifiable is therefore false . 
  these agencies do n't simply rely on passports to determine your origin . 
  they go into personal interviews with applicants to determine whether they might fake their origin story . 
  they have arab speakers and locals there to help them , they cooperate with the authorities of the countries of origin and with other eu countries . 
  it 's a difficult process which is why applying for asylum can take up to a few months even in germany . 
  if you are not actively helping them , it takes even longer to determine your case and can actually hurt it , because eventually a court may judge whether you are eligible for asylum or not . 
  it 's not just handed out willy nilly by a guy taking a look at your face `` yeah , he 's arab , wave 'em through '' , it 's a complicated and sophisticated legal process , please try wrapping your head around that . 
   considering only a minority of these people are from syria any source for that , or just a gut feeling ? 
  whose people are we talking about right now , the ones with passports or the ones without ? 
  around 35 % , by far the largest group of refugees in 2015 were identified as being from syria .
