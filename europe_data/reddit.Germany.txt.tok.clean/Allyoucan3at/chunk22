   or else ? 
  i do put effort into my responses , unlike you , so please at least be so considerate to actually read them fully :  if you do n't your chances are very very small , yet the chance you will be identified is still there and you can be deported . 
  if it can not be found you are being persecuted you wo n't get anything you wo n't be a refuge and wo n't get any benefits , nothing , besides really basic needs ( food , shelter ) . 
  you can choose to stay in germany as they ca n't deport you , but you ca n't do anything . 
  i doubt anyone is willing to go through that , just to be fed every day . 
   now you 're the one who 's ignoring what i 'm saying . 
  even if we happen to accurately determine where they 're from , the act of kicking them out is borderline impossible . 
  your words :  my point is that the balkan refugees did n't lose their papers , so deporting them was not much of an issue . 
  here you claim something entirely different , but i 'll play along . 
  it might be difficult to force someone out of your country , but it 's not difficult to legally deny them work , benefits , etc. 
  in your country . 
  there are always illegal people in any given nation . 
  whether they come as refugees first and never leave or just get smuggled in at any other instance is not a concern really . 
  we need to create legislation or better enforce it to deny these people the opportunity to scam the system , i agree on that . 
  but they are by that point illegals . 
  again , if someone stays in a country , without the ability to work , without the ability to get benefits , just relying on their personal contacts , they probably do n't have it better at their home country , why deny them  theguardian ? 
  i 'm afraid that 's trash . 
  oh please , hungary rejected every asylum request within minutes and planned building a fucking fence to make sure no-one even crosses their border into other countries willing/able to take them on , that 's not a secret . 
  many organizations , like [ this ] ( http://budapestbeacon.com/public-policy/hungary-asylum-law-may-deny-refugees-access-to-protection/26017 ) and [ this ] ( http://www.asylumineurope.org/news/15-07-2016/hungary-thousands-denied-access-protection-following-latest-law ) or [ this ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/07/hungary-change-to-asylum-law-puts-tens-of-thousands-at-risk/ ) criticize hungary for their legislation and action . 
  they effectively did not act on or at least stretched the definition of the 1951 un resolution on refugees which they fucking signed . 
   i hope you do n't actually believe that the only thing keeping these violent buffoons you are simply a piece of shit , good bye . 
  yeah , you are right it could be taken that way , will edit . 
  [ coat of arms from german state of bw ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/grosses_landeswappen_baden-w%c3%bcrttemberg.svg/1000px-grosses_landeswappen_baden-w%c3%bcrttemberg.svg.png ) , the german coat of arms is a relatively new design although based on the holy roman empire coat of arms . 
  the states inside germany , especially the southern ones have lots of lions as you can [ see ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/4f/f9/36/4ff9362cef5ec5c0844c459085b5ebcf.jpg ), 
   my point is that the balkan refugees did n't lose their papers , so deporting them was not much of an issue . 
  so you completely ignored what i wrote ? 
  the amount of people without papers is 1 . very low 2 . comparable to that of the refugee crisis of ~ 1999 including mostly nationals from the balkan region . 
   then determining where they 're from and proving it to their native countries becomes too much of a hassle . 
  which authorities still have to go through . 
  if you have no papers , you are required to assist german authorities and provide any kind of proof of origin . 
  if you do n't your chances are very very small , yet the chance you will be identified is still there and you can be deported . 
  if it can not be found you are being persecuted you wo n't get ** anything ** you wo n't be a refuge and wo n't get any benefits , nothing , besides really basic needs ( food , shelter ) . 
  you can choose to stay in germany as they ca n't deport you , but you ca n't do anything . 
  i doubt anyone is willing to go through that , just to be fed every day . 
   this means literally nothing . 
  the countries in question will not accept them back and no eu country wants to try and force it , so i 'm afraid i ca n't accept the argument . 
  this is a true issue . 
  we need to negotiate with these countries and try to reduce the reasons for flight in the first place . 
  however , these people are still rejected refuges , as explained above they get nothing . 
  if they stay here do nothing just to be fed , then they probably have it even worse when they go back . 
   not even countries like hungary denies them asylum when it comes down to it . 
  [ huh ?!, 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/15/refugee-crisis-hungary-launches-border-crackdown-live-updates ) hungary was effectively pushing the problem away , back into serbia . 
  you seem to have a twisted memory of the actual events . 
   the naivety one needs to posses , in order to think the only reason the middle-east and africa flocks to northern & western europe has anything to do with safety , is rather staggering . 
  like i 've mentioned before , you 're very much out of your depth when it comes to this topic . 
  there is no need to get personal here , i am very much in depth on this topic as you can hopefully see from my replies . 
  i am critical of europe 's actions and behavior in the entire crisis and i would prefer not to have any refugees at all . 
  the simple matter of fact is though , that there are many people fleeing a fucking war and nobody wanted them . 
  not hungary , not greece , not italy . 
  germany was the only one ( together with sweden and austria maybe ) who was willing to share the burden the border countries faced for years already and that 's why people came here . 
  are you really that oblivious to think that people cross oceans in tiny boats , suffocate in trucks and get treated like kettle at borders just to scrap 400 $ in germany ? 
  i mean that 's one explanation , but why did n't they do that the fucking 50 years before ? 
  germany 's social welfare program started in the 19th century !, 
  you think word did n't get around until now ? 
  or maybe it really has something to do with a war going on in your country , where the government shells your neighborhood , islamic extremists are marching towards your city to raze it , rebel groups recruit every able-bodied youth they can get their hands on to push their own agenda and foreign planes fly bombing runs every minute . 
  i am unsure . 
   the albanians did n't lose their papers . 
  so your issue is only with people who lost their papers but still got asylum in germany ? 
  well there are n't many . 
  in all of 2015 around 2 % or 11 721 people whos nationality was not known where processed in germany ( [ source p. 19 ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2015.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) ) this is very much comparable to the 2.7 % we had in 2000 ( `` the albanians '' ) ( same source p. 20 ) and 80 % ( same source p. 50 ) of them were accepted as refugees . 
  meaning it could be proven they had fled some sort of persecution , otherwise they would have gotten subsidiary refuge which is a bit different . 
   this is a very critical detail in the grand scheme of things . 
  point to anyone in the middle-east or africa being told to fuck off and i 'll concede the discussion . 
  around 13 % of afghans were rejected and almost 42 % of pakistanis and 8 % of the ones without papers/proof of nationality ( same source p. 50 ) . 
  now none of them were told to `` fuck off '' i am sure , but they were rejected asylum and thus have to leave the country and get no benefits . 
   which is why the find themselves in germany and northern europe . 
  you 're completely out of your depth i 'm afraid . 
  no they find themselves in northern europe because hungary is n't willing and/or able to care for 1mil + refugees which is reasonable . 
  no they wo n't be asked to fuck off . 
  they will be asked to leave the country ( if the nation of syria still exists or if the new state allows them citizenship ) unless they can meet the requirements for immigration . 
  that 's what happened to the refugees from albania that came in the 90s ( which was a similar number ) and that 's what 's going to happen once war and prosecution of opposition stops in syria or the other countries of origin . 
  painting the devil is not going to further this discussion and yes , many of the arriving might stay here , yes some abuse the system , yes some are only here `` for the benefits '' . 
  but the absolute majority is in need of basic human aid . 
  if they stay , that means they can make a living here and have found a new home , why would deny that to them ? 
  a greater number of people in an economy also always means a greater economy . 
  if you are afraid that their low salary expectations might make your job obsolete maybe the politicians should force companies to pay minimum wage that is reasonable and make them prosecute the ones who do n't , make them remove business practices like temping . 
  if you fear social injustice that 's never the refugee 's fault it 's societies . 
  and if you fear them for being arab/muslim/brown then fuck right off . 
   we have no obligation for permanent immigration . 
  and that 's not what `` refuge '' means . 
   but much more in the urban areas we are talking about it 's by no means as extreme as you make it out to be . 
  [ berlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_berlin ) has around 29 % foreigners compared to a national average of [ ~ 21 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany ) ( with an average of 29 % in the more populous western part of germany ) . 
  [ paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_paris#ethnic_groups ) has around 20 % foreigners , compared to a [ national average ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_france ) of ~ 15 % ( including french by acquisition because that 's the comparable figure in the german source ) . 
  yes cities tend to have higher percentages of foreigners than the national average in some cases , but they are hardly 1:1 vs 2:1 . 
   and in general , of course not in every case , fits reality nicely . 
  this can be said about almost any hypothesis . 
  for it to be a good one , it should fit everything in reality almost perfectly or at least have an explanation for the outliers . 
   there are two groups with distributions that have different averages . 
  that 's a basic principle of statistics . 
  every two , non-related groups of enough samples will have different outcomes . 
   in the us the differences in proportions are already more extreme , so the result is clearer . 
  i am still unsure how voting results have anything to do with the initial argument ?!, 
  maybe blacks vote democrat because they simply think trump is a racist ? 
  this has nothing to do with ethnic acceptance . 
  the outcome of a vote is going to be affected by anyone eligible to vote , no big surprise here . 
   i 'm not reading anything to reject this simple claim . 
  i never actually did ,  that 's of course a factor as well but it 's certainly not the only one . 
  is what i said . 
   no , we had labour camps for gypsies .
