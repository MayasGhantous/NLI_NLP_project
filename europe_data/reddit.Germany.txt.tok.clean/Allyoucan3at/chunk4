  um , we kind of do . 
  there is a huge lack of social workers , teachers and even doctors in our country and many of these refugees are already educated and can just as well get educated in our system . 
  i do agree with you on opportunity cost but i have n't seen any numbers on it yet ( probably there are n't any yet ) . 
  nothing in germany is destroyed though , we are actually spending this money to create a greater workforce with the immigrants , it 's much like investing in education , in the end you will get better educated people working better paying jobs instead of people that rely on welfare . 
  now there would probably be better opportunities to spend this money on , but i think states should not always be about maximizing profits . 
   not races no just specific groups of people , does n't make it any less discriminative . 
  but i know you are better than them . 
   on reddit who already know hahaha , sure the constant bitching about germany `` inviting them all to stay '' shit that is going on for weeks in this subreddit and others surely shows how well everyone grasped that concept ... 
  these refugees will be told once they apply for asylum just like any other applicant as well , you ca n't blame germany for giving them false hope while hungary puts them in trains destined to end in austria and then stop to put them in camps . 
   so we stop making it nice so you are saying we should stop making it nice for different races and/or nationalities ... and then people wonder why they are called racists, 
  i think he means the eu-border , so greece/turkey or serbia/hungary i think the point is that until now it is very hard to actually seek asylum in the eu . 
  you would need a visa and ca n't apply from an embassy . 
  yes it is always talked about like it was an open invitation , which it is n't, 
  so you 'd rather see your country go to shit than share it with other people ? 
  is not an open invitation , it is simply saying that syrian refugees will be processed in germany as opposed to being sent back to the first eu-state they entered . 
  [ oh there are way worse things ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_denial ) that are being denied , just until recently no european government acknowledged it as genocide . 
  the total number of people killed has been estimated at between 800,000 to 1.5 million . 
  and that shit happened in 1915-1918 . 
  they win , 
   `` hurry up , let 'em all in ! '', 
  the funny thing is , no one said this and it is not the case . 
  people on / r/europe are so dense they do n't understand or read what the dublin treaty said and what merkel actually did with it . 
  of course it is not possible to let all of them immigrate , that 's not the goal , never was and nobody every said it was . 
  the goal of merkels statement was to relieve hungary , greece and italy as border states , however eu-law kind of prevents that as you need a visa to travel jadda jadda jadda, 
  that would be ideal , but i doubt it 's feasible , you would have to employ all these people , train them etc , that 's going to take a while . 
  and even if you have this agency in place , what if the refugees stop coming ? 
  what is in winter ( when there are naturally less refugees ) ? 
  you would have to pay the personnel still , but if you take national agencies into the picture they are already employed trained and have other duties during the summer or keep on working with the refugees for each specific country . 
  imo there needs to be a very easy distribution key , hungary can just give out week long travel visas or specific tickets and buses , trains can be organized to other nations . 
  this needs to be sanctioned by the eu though and it 's not enough if only germany and austria accept refugees this way . 
   or even better , do the same in greece and italy so 99 % of them do not even get to hungary unregistered . 
  registering them on site would of course be the best option , but i doubt hungary is currently capable of doing that in a reasonable time frame and neither would germany be , there are just too many applicants right now . 
   however , by eu law , they must not let people go to countries that are willing to cope with the refugees absolutely correct and one of the major reasons for tension right now . 
  so i completely agree with you and i am not sure how it would be possible to cope with that , i think the dublin treaty only allows for you to process refugees but not grant them travelling rights . 
  so it 's difficult , i agree with you that merkels statements ( even if interpreted correctly ) cause hungary and other border states to have more issues . 
  i also think the dublin treaties itself were kind of . . stupid , but it is what it is . 
  maybe germany/austria/hungary can broker a deal to relieve hungary ? 
  i do n't know . 
  it 's just a fucked up situation and i think everyone wants to help to their best ability but different things hinder them . 
   not true . 
  umm , did you read my post ? 
   ** media and traffickers ** just made it out not to be . 
   also , officials did not come from the german embassy in budapest to clarify this when asked to do so during the first riots at keleti station . 
  i also do n't think that 's neither their job nor their jurisdiction , i would even guess it is forbidden for a foreign embassy to make announcements like that and if not it would at least lead to political tensions . 
  thing is , if all refugees really register in hungary , they will be there for years , 250.000 ( syrians only ) that ( by eu law ) have to be interviewed one-by-one and then their claims have to be checked in a long process , etc. 
  it is simply impossible to do this in a timely manner , usually the process takes 2 months in germany even if there is no huge influx . 
  i am not saying the hungarian people treats anyone badly , the government surely is insensitive towards them , but meh . 
  it 's just a fucked up situation and hungary is not showing any sign of solidarity ( `` we wo n't take refugees '' , building a fence , etc ) but not only that , they are even preventing people from reaching countries that are willing to cope with the refugees . 
   in fact they are the only country involved at the moment who even tried . 
  germany did n't do anything that was not sanctioned by the dublin treaty , nor did anyone else break any rules of it afaik . 
  hungary is doing everything they are legally obliged to , nothing more , that 's fair enough , but does n't really improve the situation . 
  but not due to economics . 
   it was not clear enough . 
  it was perfectly clear !, 
  media and traffickers just made it out not to be . 
  police in germany found videos with traffickers that cut merkels announcements so it would sound like germany takes everyone in without any question . 
  germany itself * never * said anything of the likes of taking in more refugees than legally possible . 
  just because some people that fail to inform themselves think this way , does n't make it true . 
  have you read through any thread on / r/europe lately ? 
  because that could as easily come from a german right now ... 
   one refugee i am sure there also was one hungarian that treated them badly . 
  germany does n't accept all those refugees ... they simply said they will process refugees from syria in their own country , that 's it , nothing more . 
  merkel did n't promise to take in millions or to make them all german citizens in a hand stroke , we were simply going by the rules suspending dublin iii for syrian refugees , a lot of people claim germany is dooming the eu because we let in all the refugees , let me tell you they would be coming ** anyway ** because asylum is a basic human right in the eu and as long as they can proof syrian citizenship they will be accepted as long as this war rages period . 
  what you posted proofs absolutely nothing xd the pictures of italy and germany are both bombed cities , nothing to do with economy really and the graph just shows that italy and greece followed the same trend as all other nations just with a lower base level , do n't really get your point from this , not that i would agree with the previous guy , but this is just poor . 
  [ in your endo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhtfknnd04a ), 
  switzerland is doing this for years already and they have the best integrated migrants in all europe . 
  they get assigned a specific kanton where they are `` needed '' most and will be able to find work and housing . 
  this decentralizes them , there is no ghettoization , etc. 
  really great system that merkel just recently praised . 
  or maybe he simply did n't see any of them because they stay at home instead of going to his language classes ? 
  if they even exist , no i am sure you have it figured out right . 
   according to the law they must be processed by the first eu country the enter . 
  there is a clear paragraph in the dublin treaties that every country can voluntarily take the responsibility of the asylum process and that is exactly what germany has done . 
   how many of those do you think could be known terrorists ? 
  any european resident could be , no matter of their origin . 
  ira , raf , nsu and etu might not have been active in the past but i highly doubt it will never happen again , especially in times like these . 
   by discrediting them ? 
  discrediting who ? 
  it 's fair of other countries to put all the blame on germany and discredit their every move even though they are a key player in holding the entire fucking union together and it 's not okay for germany to ask for eu-wide quotas for an existing problem ? 
  i 'd also like to see this whole poll , might just as well be that britain as a whole is way less enthusiastic towards gays than france and germany . 
  refugee status is a way more complex topic than murder , it includes a whole area/nation . 
  you would have to proof you are hunted in every part of your country in order to get asylum , this happened for some politicians in the past and snowden for example . 
  if your neighbour wants to kill you and threatens you you better take that to the police instead of seeking asylum . 
   and germany should n't be able to dictate such rules germany is not dictating any rules , they act according to the treaties they signed in dublin and to general eu legislation . 
   i ca n't fukin comprehend how the governments are allowing people who travel without documents through their countries , unbelievable . 
  so like the whole schengen area ? 
  and with all the slaves we would n't need to buy expensive robots in our factories, 
  no it 's a more efficient way to process the huge influx of refugee seekers . 
  ~ 4 million people left syria during the war , imagine them all showing up at once in hungary , it would take years to process them one by one , that 's why germany voluntarily agreed to neglect the dublin agreement ( this is allowed ) where it says they have to apply in the country they first arrive in and * process * all syrian refugees in germany . 
  how is that a bad thing ? 
   ( and the immigration control will doubt everything about you ) that 's why you need proof  as i said if you really are eligible for refugee status no eu country will reject you , but if you are not , well why would you apply for asylum then ? 
  what goes around , comes around , 
  there are refugee camps outside syria with roughly 3 million syrians in mostly jordan and turkey . 
  germany is also moving against traffickers at their borders ( we do n't have jurisdiction in north africa ) . 
  thing is you will have a really hard time entering the eu legally ( you would need a visa depending on your country of origin ) to even apply for refugee status , that 's why the whole trafficking scene is so big . 
  if a person is achieving refugee status the whole point is to not send them back , because they are refugees ... 
  if they fail to get that status , they will be sent back to their home country . 
  the point of germany `` inviting '' syrians was to relief countries like hungary and greece because these countries are geographically closer to the refugees origin and would thus have to carry a heavier load supporting them . 
  we did n't open the border for anyone that did n't deserve refugee status , a human right btw . 
  if you can proof that you are an ethical refugee you will get refugee status in every eu country including germany .
