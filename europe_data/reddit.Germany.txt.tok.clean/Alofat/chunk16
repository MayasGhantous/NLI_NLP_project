  and i do think that has to do with the love of being anti- $ . 
  i do n't see what your question has to do with my comment , but no , everybody has the right to critisize the euro and the eu as much as they want . 
  the british press is just adorable , how about we wait for the first elections before we start planning germany 's euro exit . 
   germany and her satellites w00t ? 
  we have satellites ? 
  cool , where ? 
  i do n't care . 
  i know it is the original title but please do n't call it deutsche . 
  it 's like calling american airlines , well , american . 
  blah , blah , liberals , blah , blah stopped reading right there . 
  why do i suddenly feel like i 'm talking to my very drunk girlfriend . 
  meh , try again . 
  if it is the first one you are failing miserably . 
  if we would compare it to movie extras , luxembourg would have been the back of a head in a coffee house scene . 
  it 's academic anyway there are no human races . 
  gay elephants ... 
  allright , weird subject change ... 
  oh please , the 30 year war was n't exactly all sunshine and roses either . 
  well he would have had to shoot himself then and good portion of western europe and america too , those pesky german genes are very resilient . 
  i played around with my keyboard for a bit to see what looks good to me , so it held no meaning for me at that time . 
  i later found out it means ale in old saxon though , go figure . 
  just because they get more sun does n't mean they are cleaner . 
   welcome to the us/british boat , not too many members , but it can be a good time . 
  oh we are on that boat for a very long time now , you should have heard the poles in the 90 's and early 00 's , thank the fsm they mellowed out a bit . 
  or the turkish government who keeps politicising turks living in germany . 
  nah we are used to it . 
  oh do n't worry , i 'll only visit the huffpo to get my laugh of the day . 
  if we were truly `` pussywhipped '' i doubt we would have to read so much nonsense . 
  at least she is clever enough to not outright mention wwii . 
  well , that makes life easier , at least one knows where one stands . 
  we probably should change our national anthem to the word sorry repeated over and over in all languages of the world . 
  so you people have given up and finally turned french ? 
  the sun is actually shining here too , it is n't melting any of the snow but it is shining . 
   is this the day of shitty articles ? 
  [ apparently ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/justine-frangouliargyris/germany-europes-greedy-bo_b_2954428.html?utm_hp_ref=germany ) it is . 
  oh you and your made up countries . 
  no , he was talking about wwii , he tried to make a lameass joke . 
  again , that was wwii . 
  i 'm not talking about wwii , you and the morons who downvoted me should read up on pre world war era . 
  here is a start [ ruhrpolen ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruhrpolen ) . 
  yeah , nobody really cares . 
  germany got flooded with poles at the beginning of the 20th century . 
  first world countries are so rich they can even digest lactose !, 
  i wonder do the dutch also have friesen jokes ? 
  you know `` why did the friesian submarine sink ? 
  - because they left the door open ! '', 
  that kinda thing . 
  how is that ? 
  i see it the other way around , i 'm actually surprised that it is only 25 % . 
  10 years ago you would have had more than 50 % against it . 
  seeing how everybody bitched about the introduction 10 years ago , 25 % is not much at all . 
  and i really , really doubt that these 25 % will translate into more than 5 % of the votes . 
  three in four germans would n't back anti-euro party, 
  we never hated you , we make fun of you sometimes , shake our head in disbelief , sure , mock you for you inability to stop even the slowest penalty from going into the net but hate ? 
  no , never . 
  as far as i know there was never any animosity regarding england . 
  but how far back it goes is anyones guess . 
  i think the personal union between hanover and england might be a probable starting point for the love fest . 
  like the count said anglophilia was always big in germany , i never understood it but to each his own . 
  there really is n't something newsworthy here . 
  i do n't think we will start shipping eggs over the atlantic . 
  most eggs i can buy here in northern germany come from northern germany . 
  a few from the netherlands or denmark . 
  i was just disagreeing on the controversial bit and the titles . 
  `` liar !, 
  liar ! '', 
  seriously ? 
  `` reservoir dogs '' ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  `` mo ' money '' because that is such an incredible poetic title . 
  `` alien '' , nobody knew what that meant , should they have used `` ausl\u00e4nder '' !, 
  one of my favorites is `` eine schrecklich nette familie '' , original is `` married with children '' , awesome . 
  / s also , it seems i got to piss some of those twats off , worth it . 
   dubbing is controversial in germany . 
  no it 's not . 
  the only ones who give a fuck are pretentious twats , who feel somehow special because they can understand english . 
  yeah to you , now shut up . 
  meanwhile the overwhelming majority likes the dubbed shit just fine , even if they do n't get every single idiotic injoke , which btw they would probably still not get even if they could speak perfect english . 
  also i must say i like the german version of a lot of your examples a whole lot more than the originals . 
  the same might be true for football . 
  i think you underestimate the popularity of [ handball ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/team_handball ) . 
  it 's an efficient way to share body heat . 
  meh , shitty song . 
  i was making fun of you and now i 'm sad because you did n't get it , ah well , you win some ... 
   in any event , not something that is enjoyable to watch . 
  actually , i think they are very hillarious in an ironic kind of way . 
  my train of thought was more along the line of our not invading se shows a great deal of humor and [ restrained ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=greek+demonstration+german&amp;hl=de&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;tbo=d&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:official&amp;channel=s&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ut0dueo1oc3hsgaw1ihwbg&amp;ved=0caoq_auoaq&amp;biw=1040&amp;bih=791 ) . 
  do n't be testy . 
  well we have n't invaded southern-europe yet , so ... 
  because we take our local infighting very seriously and only if there is an outside threat we will stop fighting amongst ourselves . 
  yes , i was n't actually disagreeing with you . 
  i was merely commenting on the utter disconnection from reality some people seem to experience when it comes to politics/ians . 
  especially the thought that money is n't growing on trees or that not every issue has a perfect solution is quite hard to grasp for some people . 
  i remember people being annoyed with merkel as she announced the end of nuclear power in germany , `` oh she only does it because so many people are against it , typical politician ! '', 
  yeah , no shit , that is how democrazy works people . 
  belarus , nobody cares about them . 
  i could be wrong but i think the op is experiencing a bit of `` schadenfreude '' and the headline is his way of showing it . 
  tl , dr : it 's a joke . 
  oh they do ... fucking llamas . 
  no , he did n't , that is as moronic as the `` conquer the world '' nonsense the yankees are spouting .
