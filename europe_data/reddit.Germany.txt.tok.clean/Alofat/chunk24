  a `` friend '' of mine was there in the early 90 's and yes she got asked that very question . 
  sure , any other conspiracy theories you want to get off your chest ? 
  it 's not really about the spanish , that they are angry and leash out , right or wrong , i can understand . 
  but that someone like kempe can write such a brazen and unbalanced propaganda piece is beyond my comprehension . 
   frederick kempe is president and ceo of the atlantic council . 
  he previously spent more than twenty-five years as a reporter , columnist , and editor for the wall street journal , where , among other roles , he served as chief diplomatic correspondent , berlin bureau chief , and editor and associate publisher of the journal 's europe edition ... 
  he was a big bullshitter too , that was my little point i tried to make . 
  uh huh . 
  i see the propaganda machine is working in full gear again . 
   a country that has been among of the most welcoming toward germans , who vacation here in droves of all the bullshit in there this was my favorite . 
  also :  the increased resentment is captured by a history lesson one spanish business leader says he would like to give germans , but he wo n't do it on the record for fear it would hurt his german business . 
   first , he said , national division was the price germany paid for misery it exacted upon europe . 
  second , he continued , giving up the deutschemark and monetary sovereignty was the price for german reunification after the cold war . 
  thus , he said , germany 's historic responsibility must be above all to save the euro , as its creation marked the ultimate european reconciliation and end to world war two . 
   `` if europe blows up [ because of the germans ] , '' he asks provocatively , `` are we authorized to say germany should be divided again ? '' franco would be proud , shame on the author for actually publishing such an enormous piece of crap , especially someone with his vita should know better . 
  i can read it just fine , maybe because i have noscript installed . 
  neither does `` black '' . 
  still better then the one in [ frankfurt ] ( http://geo.hlipp.de/photos/01/14/011426_21c233c1.jpg ) . 
  right , you forgot about our armada of flying saucers on the moon . 
  yes what were you people thinking ? 
  also is starlight express huge in \u00c9ire or why the glitter are they looking like that ? 
  to be fair the brits always never deserves to get points . 
  also german performers won twice in the past , which should be virtually impossible if your theory were true . 
  i was there once for a week , but thank old fritz i could escape before they could force a white sausage down my throat . 
  i am know convinced that this would have sealed my eternal damnation . 
  i will eat a currywurst in your honor dear fallen comrade . 
  i 'm not quite as optimistic as you are , and taking on the municipalties will be quite a fight , up there with waterloo and stalingrad . 
  i rather think the vat would be a better choice . 
  urghhhh nnnnnoooo , i will not give in , my prussian heritage forbids me to think anything positive about people south of weimar . 
  yeah she looked like she had better things to do . 
  let 's hope that is n't an omen . 
  just a tad , you 'll hardly see the difference , we promise . 
  trust us ... 
  once you all can speak german and know better , you 'll share our distaste for everything bavarian . 
  battle royal as it should be !, 
  well the eu was always about small steps . 
  but any additional integration into europe would mean a pretty serious rewrite of the gg . 
  i 'm not quite sure we are there yet . 
  sorry but sarkozy was always annoying to her . 
  you forget how much grand and stupid ideas he always had . 
  it is protocol that the foreign dignity is the one nearest to the band playing , after all they are playing for him . 
  pfft , she is n't the first one , i remember another case ~ 15 years ago . 
  schr\u00f6der `` gave up '' because of problems in his own rangs , the bundesrat was n't really the problem . 
   merkel has the advantage of having nothing she believes in whatsoever , oh please spare me . 
   renewal of a grand coalition ( conservatives and social democrats ) , a possibility that , as bad as it would be for germany i do n't see that as a bad thing , better than a new spd/greens fuck up . 
  or even worse a spd/ex-sed/greens end of the times here we come coalition . 
  curios lack of actual germans in this german reaction video . 
  come to think of it not much reactions in there either . 
  above and alone are two different concepts . 
  let 's hope not . 
  look , you are no more responsible than i am for what happened before our birth . 
  i find it just curios how some try to rationalize these times . 
  and yes i know about the massacres in africa . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what you mean by more recent events . 
  ah , the good old `` sure , we killed millions but look we left you some trains ! '', 
  defense . 
  nice . 
  of course , but there is a little bit more to it than just us handing them a huge gift . 
  i somehow do n't see such a treaty happening between germany and iran or north korea , at least not in the foreseeable future . 
  call me an optimist . 
  problem is , there is that pesky little law that only allows us to sell to allies . 
  working hours = !, 
  productivity, 
  juice would be awesome , but athena and ngo are the more useful ones . 
  no i 'm not wrong , greek wages are significantly lower than german ones . 
  if wages were the only problem , greece should have no problem to compete . 
  german workers are already better paid than workers in those 4 countries , i do n't see how a little raise is changing anything for the better . 
  the problem is n't workers wages , it is the structural differences . 
  what ? 
  well , take every country you can think off and put a [ / r / ] ( / r / ) in front of it , chances are it will exist . 
  [ / r/germany ] ( / r/germany ) , [ / r/france ] ( / r/france ) , [ / r/poland ] ( / r/poland ) , [ / r/italy ] ( / r/italy ) , [ / r/spain ] ( / r/spain ) , [ / r/portugal ] ( / r/portugal ) , [ / r/hungary ] ( / r/hungary ) , [ / r/chile ] ( / r/chile ) , [ / r/china ] ( / r/china ) , [ / r/japan ] ( / r/japan ) , [ / r/uruguay ] ( / r/uruguay ) etc. 
  wtf is that guy smoking ? 
  that was n't merkel , that was bush in drags . 
  eye witnesses report that he was shouting something like `` goddamn godless commies '' . 
  i do n't know about [ / r/europe ] ( / r/europe ) but [ / r/de ] ( / r/de ) and [ / r/germany ] ( / r/germany ) are very downvote happy when it comes to comments that are pro conservative . 
  a chinese , a middle eastern dude and someone from south america , judging from the fighting style . 
  that is actually pretty heavy symbolism , the only one missing is a dude with a really big gun . 
  we can share , 10 % is more than enough for me . 
  are you and the op time travelers ? 
  quick , what are the lotto numbers for the next few weeks ? 
  if that is all that happens to her , then she must be a pretty decent person . 
  where is polandball when you need him ? 
  is that a surprise to anyone ? 
  , while looking over the channel longingly . 
  dibs on las vegas . 
  psh , ixnay on the beriumtinay !, 
  well , we are fucked . 
  hmm , can i come over ? 
  yeah , lots of bread , pasta , a d\u00f6ner or two a month and potatoes in all shapes and forms . 
  edit : funnily enough not that much meat , go figure . 
  was n't there a joke about austrians wanting to become germans and getting stuck halfway through . 
  i hate you right now , i really really do . 
  why ? 
  he is fucking right , glamor over substance is nothing new in italy . 
  and now we are grateful that the torygraph does n't make a nazi quip ? 
  are you insane ? 
  fakt is btw . 
  published by the same people that are responsible for bild . 
  it is more or less a carbon copy . 
  i find this fact very amusing .
