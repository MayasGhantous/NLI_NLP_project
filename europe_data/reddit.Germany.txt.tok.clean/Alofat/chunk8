  is that a challenge ? 
  and i thought brits had a sense of humor , guess we are both wrong . 
   because it is being run by a private british company !, 
  and as we all know , private companies often lie to governments from taxes to standards . 
  so you would be okay with it when it was a government agency doing the job ? 
  if yes than we are both of the same mind and can end it here and if not your argument is worthless because it has not much to do with our discussion . 
  i do n't know about you but we have still a few thousand standing around here . 
  you need to learn reading user names and not just look at the pretty flags . 
  also wtf do you wan na do ? 
  send in the tanks ? 
  because people never make mistakes , it 's always a conspiracy . 
  does n't work like that , it 's not like you pay a million and they just ignore your background . 
  even the us has a `` invest a million dollars into our economy and you 'll get a green card scheme '' and they are paranoid as fuck . 
  also any career criminal who wants to come here and is n't brain dead will find an easier way to get into europe , marriage is nice and easy solution and does n't cost quite as much . 
  [ vancouver ] ( http://m.germany.info/contentblob/4000086/galeriebild_gross/3528088/01sochi3.jpg ) [ sochi ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/1/23/1390481102198/9c76b7f6-b75d-4249-811e-0d35a2ac1cdb-620x389.jpeg ) [ london ] ( http://storage.canoe.ca/v1/blogs-prod-photos/0/8/f/b/3/08fb39007b3b9306e3b9e3b388a9f9d0.jpg?stmp=1380770042 ) nothing to do with `` aristocratic pride '' , they are just ugly as hell . 
  and for fucks sake ca n't they get rid of this bullshit baby blue is for boys and pink is for girls idiocy . 
  believe what you will but it 's not a statement just a serious lack of style just like every olympic outfit in the last 2 decades . 
  wow , 277 people , oh noes !, 
  whatever shall we do ? 
  seriously , that is n't even worth reporting . 
  why people get all out of bounds on this issue is beyond me , it 's not like europe will get flooded with millions of billionaires . 
  or just on a sunday morning . 
  not really out of date poland is still a transit country for car thieves . 
  oh please the shit people comment on topics dealing with germany here is beyond belief , do n't be so testy . 
  fuck you too . 
  yeah , well , nuclear energy is n't `` clean '' either . 
  you can sue for everything , does n't mean you 'll win . 
  because there are more countries than there are banknotes and nobody shall feel left out . 
  could you imagine the outcry if there were german , french , italian , spanish buildings on there but no dutch , belgian or greek ones ? 
  since the invention of the alps . 
  aside from the uk of course which is somehow a special little butterfly . 
  the olympic table disagrees . 
  dear leader is n't democratically elected , our politicians however are . 
  move ... 
  and with really nice you mean over 30 \u00b0 c ? 
  no our summers are a lot longer than 10 days , they just are n't scorching hot . 
  + / - 6 weeks, 
  i like our weather and i do n't see what is wrong with it . 
  more or less nice summers , awesome fall and spring , only the winters could be a bit crisper . 
  apart from bavaria , where everyone who is n't freshly shaved is automatically a suspect , i have never met a police wo/man who was n't relaxed . 
  ok that one asshole bike cop in hamburg does n't count , i would be grumpy too if i had to wear bike short all day long . 
  yeah ... 
  only a joke i promise , cross my heart and hope to , well , not die maybe get sick for a few days or something . 
  did n't you already have hanukkah , do n't you think that is a bit * cough * grea ... you know what forget i asked . 
  seriously ? 
  because people in berlin are not all that different from anywhere else in germany . 
  sure there are assholes in germany , like everywhere , totally agree . 
  but / u/kukul comment is in itself highly bigoted and the fact that this shit is getting that many upvote just shows me how much anti-german hate there is here . 
  if i had to bet , nowhere ... 
  probably more to do with psychological warfare then intelligence gathering . 
  `` see you are not safe here or anywhere else . '', 
  why do n't they just make it a tradition and burn it themselves ? 
  i mean there comes a time when you just have to embrace the anarchy . 
  so pro debt then ? 
  you do know it 's not a `` law '' anymore , right ? 
  uh , we have a very long and very rich wine tradition here in germany , just saying . 
  funny , my gdr childhood was full of be still or the christkind does n't come on x-mas . 
  actually more like holy-night-man . 
  again , there is no threat , it 's all empty posturing . 
  there could be a russian nuclear bomb hanging over berlin and i would n't be afraid of a russian attack . 
  russia is not going to attack an eu nation , period . 
  because there is no scenario in which they would loose less than others or even win a war . 
  now if you want to talk about economic sanctions , then i could agree that russia might be a threat . 
  i believe , of course i could be wrong on that , that russia has `` rockets '' that are able to `` target '' every piece of dirt on this our earth . 
  why i should be afraid of some mobile rocket launchers in k\u00f6nigsberg is beyond me . 
  russia is n't a threat to any eu nation . 
  and here is a prime example of what is wrong with democracy . 
  how did that happen ? 
  fine 3-1 , do n't anyone ever dare say we are n't gracious and generous in the face of our frenemy 's utter football despair . 
  now that you have understood how to read the charts , maybe you wan na hook us other not so fortunate ones up and translate into plain english ? 
  in the wars you got helped out by other nations and in the world cup you got helped by the ref . 
  so 3-0 really . 
  or go to the next bigger library and get the nazi edition . 
  seeing that our exports and imports into the euro-zone were , at least in the last years , always on par with each other i never got the our exports hurting greece nonsense . 
  which poorer countries would that be ? 
  and ? 
  eh could be worse at least i did n't mix up their and they 're . 
  per capita : fourth per percentage : second per total : third, 
  what differing opinions would that be ? 
  are the alps to high ? 
  is rome to big ? 
  you do n't like how hungary 's boarders are shaped ? 
  it 's france right ? 
  they are too chipper , bastards !, 
  and do n't get me started on lapland ... 
  no way , we called dibs . 
  the thing is , people already yell for laws without any prove either way . 
  how can we have a real discussion when every argument is just an emotional opinion ? 
  that is really pissing me off lately . 
  earlier this year it was br\u00fcderle and that twitter idiocy and now they want to fuck around with the prostitutes . 
  sorry but i have n't seen any real evidence that this is actually true . 
  and even if it were true how is criminalizing the legal women helpful . 
  al it would do is driving traffickers even more underground . 
  totally ignoring the financial crisis and the eastern european integration . 
  no one got our `` states '' at all . 
  uh , yeah brain fart , somehow added a 0 there somewhere . 
  yeah ~ 1 % . 
  our [ total exports in 2012 ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/165463/umfrage/deutsche-exporte-wert-jahreszahlen/ ) were worth 1.1 trillion $ that 's roughly 0.1 % . 
  or did i have a brain fart ? 
  edit : nope wrong , bad brain , disregard .
