  so , when hearing that someone is in the bundeswehr , what a lot of people would think was `` this guy chose to learn shooting instead of actually doing something of value to people around him '' . 
  i 've met two in hamburg !, 
  one guy who grew up in a family of jehova 's witnesses , and one girl from a christian college in lithuania . 
  well , some are practicing the religion so it 'll come up in conversation . 
  in places with a significant jewish population , people will also guess a jewish background based on your name or your looks . 
  i think that has a high error rate though . 
  but i never know how people decide if a german-sounding last name is german or jewish . 
  i prefer to flaunt the fact that we do n't even need a passport to travel in europe and several other popular destinations , so i only bring my id card ( personalausweis ) . 
   the saxon dialect is the foundation of modern high german . 
  actually , that 's the dialect of lower saxony , [ specifically hanover ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_german ) . 
  * a shilling for candles * by josephine tey . 
  highly enjoyable in terms of language , but i 'm not sure what to think of the crime story plot . 
  what ? 
  the gypsies most people see in western europe are annoying clingy unwashed beggars in the city centers . 
  nice mix of little paris with big vladivostok, 
  i 've checked some and they were livejournal accounts , posting to their own blog and comments of popular bloggers like zyalt . 
  yeah it 's a closet . 
  since the price is quoted per day , my guess is someone 's trying to rent it out to people who are in town for a day and just need a mattress to crash . 
  300 $ a month is almost what you 'd pay for a small apartment to yourself in berlin . 
  question to you : do you actually believe that crap , or are you just sharing it in the hope thousands will only read the title and assume it 's true ? 
  the only really confusing group i 've encountered are the celtic languages . 
  i 've given up on ever getting eclipsis right . 
  there are black people in ukraine , too . 
  there were a lot of students from nigeria in donetsk , and they 've [ been subject to kidnappings , for example ] ( https://news.pn/en/russiainvadedukraine/109795 ) . 
  they are in danger right now , as they stand out and the strelkov gang liked to claim they had `` killed black american mercenaries , come see their bodies '' . 
  besides this , black people in ukraine are subject to the usual stereotypes , which are not watered-down by political correction . 
  that 's slovenia, 
  do you by chance remember the name of that town ? 
  you 're probably not searching for images of germany from a tourist perspective as often . 
  [ this tumblr ] ( http://allthingseurope.tumblr.com/tagged/germany ) is a bit heavy on cities as opposed to nature , but you 'd find tons of breathtaking pictures from the alps or schwarzwald . 
  edit : aww , i 've browsed for two minutes and i 'm already in love with freiburg and trier . 
  will need to visit them . 
  he actually said [ it 's true ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/2h49au/%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b5%d1%86_%d0%b2_%d0%b1%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b5_%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%be%d0%b2/ckp82gz ) that there are a lot of nazis . 
  he modified it a bit , saying there 's no official stance in the batallion and that the older guys are more indifferent to the nazi stuff . 
  but basically he admitted that it was true . 
  it 's azov that has the black sun , not shakhtar . 
  you can say what you like about azov , but i would n't condemn ukrainians for supporting it . 
  they 're fighting in a war for their country while this shakhtar account holder is probably sitting at home posting pictures . 
  if the people are indeed doing the hitler salute in the second picture . 
  it 's despicable though . 
  http://de.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=1488 for some reason all russian speaking people know it . 
  for example , almost everyone commenting on this video will make the same joke that `` it 's our new 1488 hryvnya note '' . 
  which is why i 'm surprised at the 80 % for russian in this chart . 
  tourist experience , but out of the three baltic capitals , it was vilnius where i just never got any use for my russian . 
  maybe the question for lithuanians was worded in a way that people marked a language even if they could only say hello . 
  rultes , i like you specifically and i remember your ama . 
  but it 's kinda pathetic that people will see 88 in a nickname and it 's not the year of birth that comes to their minds first . 
  also , unlike in russian speaking countries , the 1488 meme/circlejerk does n't really exist in germany , so it 's doubly ironic that you 're calling him out on it . 
  am i late to the party ? 
  please please tell me something about skopje and ohrid . 
  all i know is that i love the sweet macedonian wine . 
  ohrid sounds more interesting , but i can only get tickets to skopje . 
  what would be the fastest way to go between them ? 
  i speak russian and german if that helps . 
   read pravda do you mean kp ? 
  i have n't heard of the original pravda in ages , it 's become completely irrelevant . 
  kp at least lives on as a tabloid . 
  he might not have been very known outside russia , because i think he was n't profiled as a hardcore oppositioner like navalny , but everyone in russia most definitely knew him , because he 's been in russian politics for 20 years , he 's been a minister and vice-premier , and he was always one of the better known political figures . 
  and if you look at the russian opposition , there are not that many people who could run for higher offices . 
  the other parties - the communists , ldpr , also limonov 's guys - are not really opposition at this point . 
  the others like navalny have no experience in government , which is a source of distrust for voters . 
  try to list opposition people who could be profiled as a better candidate than nemtsov in practically any vote . 
  the list will be 2-3 people max . 
  people are saying he 's been a washout , but do they have anyone better in mind ? 
  thanks for the heads-up , i 'll try to stay somewhere else then , maybe sorrento or ischia . 
  great , thanks !, 
  they ca n't go full romania , romania went `` full romania '' once it joined the eu , not when they got visa free travel . 
  if you do n't have to worry about a visa , you can make the trip much cheaper . 
  you can find a deal on the flights , stay at a friend 's home , find a host at couchsurfing or get the cheapest hostel . 
  for visa applications , you often have to buy tickets and book a hotel beforehand , and lots of people are scared of buying non-refundable lowcost airline tickets if there 's a possibility that their application might be declined . 
  especially if they are not the best applicant , for example they are a student and their parents are sponsoring the trip . 
  there 's a lot of students who can afford a trip to the eu if it 's cheap ( wizzair + hostel + supermarket food ) , but have never applied for visa and the process and the possibility of a decline scares them . 
  pensioners from france ? 
  this . 
  for a non-slavic example , look at romanian , 99,9 % of romanians are too lazy to use the proper diacritics when they post online and so their posts become harder to read . 
  it works with german because germans always escape their diacritics . 
  if you see someone writing muller instead of mueller , you can be sure he does n't know any german . 
  because they ban artists who had given concerts in occupied crimea . 
  russian authorities definitely knew that , anyone in russia knew that , it 's often mentioned on russian tv . 
  she was too low-key before her selection to be banned , but obviously not afterwards . 
  russia prepared to send an artist to a country part of which they have occupied and another part stirred up a conflict in very recently . 
  instead of showing a gesture of good will and sending an artist who could n't be shown to welcome and celebrate the occupation , they went and chose an artist who was bound to be banned . 
  probably not current acts , but older people like laima vaikule who 've been around for ages . 
  you can read luther 's bible translation , ca n't you ? 
  and it 's twice as old . 
  i hear you . 
  i used to be pretty dismissive of people who do n't learn german quickly , because i had come to germany pretty young and learned quickly and did n't realize how different it is for professionals . 
  people who comment on that usually just place you in a box mentally ( `` immigrants do n't even bother to learn our language '' ) and judge the whole box without any interest for your personal story . 
  i still have kept some accent though . 
  i 'm the exact opposite of what the guy who moved to belgium wrote in this thread . 
  i share more of my life-defining experiences with germans than i do with russians . 
  my habits and tastes have been shaped by germany mostly . 
  but me having an accent still sets me apart . 
  it 's like i have a stutter and the increased social anxiety that comes with stuttering , and then there 's a small group of people that i do n't have that problem with and can relax with . 
  your hungarian being that good in just one year is super impressive . 
  i 've tried to learn hungarian myself once , so i know how hard it is . 
  ersatz ( \u044d\u0440\u0437\u0430\u0446 ) is a valid loanword in russian , the translator just used the same word in the english text . 
  astra beer has some funny ads , but i 'm too lazy to translate , they all use wordplay . 
  still , here 's a collection : http://www.astra-bier.de/de/astra/werbung.html,
