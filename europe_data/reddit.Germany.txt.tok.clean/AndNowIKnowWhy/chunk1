these are soo beautiful !, 
  and even the men look gorgious . 
  as someone mentioned on imgur : til lithuanians = fancy hobbits . 
  yeah , centralistic vs. federal . 
  has both it 's up - and downsides ... 
  oh , now * you * go on [ ( i 'm just quickly noting down your name and will take a simple odor probe if you do n't mind ... ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=iu-nja4y1ri#t=295 ), 
  you like that do n't you ;-), 
  yeah paris is to me the biggest representative of the clich\u00e9 of a capital beeing really disconnected from it 's country , or in a sense the country and the capital kind of standing in opposition to one one another , like vienna , or berlin a bit , too . 
  oh , but paris is n't france , as far as i understood it , anyways . 
  wow paris could be a new switzerland ... ( what am i getting myself into ... ), 
  * cough *, 
  go on ... 
  dude we 've tried some other stuff and neither the weimarer republik nor . . eh ... the aftermath was too impressive ... 
  i agree . 
  okay , after i have visited belgrade , which corner would i head to next ? 
  and why that region ? 
  thanks to your post have i spent diving into wikipedia and trying to get to know more about serbia . 
  thank you !, 
  let 's say i woud like to visit serbia . 
  how should i go about it , in your opinion , to get to know your country properly ? 
  ah , i see , i did n't realize there is this rather positive view on her . 
  i only heard of all the hatred for her from states like greece for beeing a dominant bully . 
  really ? 
  can you elaborate on your for me foreign perspective on this ? 
  thank you very much , i was n't aware of putin having been stationed in germany and speaking german , that explains a lot . 
  i 'm not a hundred percent clear on why germany is the link between east and west apart from it 's geological position and the history/wall , because i do n't see a cultural link to the east and there is no connection language wise . 
  but all in all that makes more sense now . 
  i just think that another more slawic and male politician would be ideal to deal with putin , but then again , her speaking russian and the aspect of the strong economy certainly weigh in relevantly . 
  our former chancellor would have been ideal , since he and putin got along excellently and seem to be friends in private . 
  but i do think she is a strong and rather reliable diplomat . 
  here in germany we mostly just stare nervously eastward scratching our head and then briefly glancing over westward to see what the u.s. is doing . 
  it 's like watching a ping-pong game , only from the perspective of sitting on the net . 
  and here in germany we know * exactly * what that feels like to be sandwiched between ` murica and mother russia . 
  i 'm sorry for the ukrainian people . 
  i think it 's weird how merkel of all people is part of the diplomatic exchanges , but let 's hope she can contribute something . 
  i fear that the deescalation ship has sailed ... 
  i 'm sorry for the russian people , too . 
  that actually made me laugh . 
  wow , i remeber this one guy in recent german history that was about as delusional and would order troops to be moved that did n't exist anymore ... 
  it 's just amazing how some people get to work in the highest offices and would n't survive a day as a gas station worker . 
  i 've been hardwired to never let any of this kind of sarcasm slip out . 
  i belong to the generation that learned how to tiptoe around even slightly non-pc stuff . 
  we do it among friends , but we were brought up to be fully aware of the shit this country did , and this kind of comment is something we feel we are n't allowed to do . 
  we are so terribly self aware ... we ca n't even call out the bullshit israel comes up with . 
  could n't resist ...

  whoa !, 
  i 'm in for some wiki time . 
  thanks for that !, 
  ah , i get it now ! ... sorry for you . 
  honestly , my favourite . 
  represents the people and their musical heritage way better than some stupid lion that is n't even part of the regions ' fauna ... 
  but why then not appreciate sarcasm in english ? 
  at least it seems that the consensus is that germans are both not good at making jokes but also at laughing at them ... 
  ah , i forgot about that . 
  this surely plays a role . 
  funny , but somewhat true . 
  i have spoken with french , israeli , spanish , irish and english people about how foreign languages are taught in their country , and most of them complained about the style and quality of those subjects . 
  as far as i understood , german schools do a better job than many others . 
  spain especially surprised me . 
  i 'm not sure it 's still true , but with the regional dialects everything is a little more difficult . 
  on mallorca , as far as i got it , they learn all subjects in mallorquin , a catalan dialect , which is a spanish dialect . 
  they learn mallorquin , then as first additional language they learn castillano ( standard spanish ) , and * then * they learn something else , like english . 
  it 's almost impossible to squeeze in more time for another language , when all the other subjects like history and math and whatnot need to be covered , too . 
  but i 'm not all certain . 
  there 's many issues , i agree . 
  but it 's a hell of a lot data to start with . 
  great one !, 
  france freaks me out , i wonder how to interpret that result . 
  i always thought they had a high immigration rate ? 
  [ `` the trouble with scotland is that it 's full of scots .

  ah i get it !, 
  they hate the stereotypical leprechaun ... . . ^, 
  sometimes i 'm sorry for the swiss . 
  there 's no place on earth they will not encounter a cultural shock when trying to use the public transport . 
  ah , one of the most beautiful manuscripts on earth is displayed in dublin , the [ book of kells ] ( http://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php?dris_id=ms58_003v ), 
  i got it explained by guy who 's father works for the military and has a che guevara image on his wall like this . 
  i got it explained several times like that . 
  you get jerks in every country . 
  i just rather got the impression that basically all consent on pedestrians crossing the street everywhere . 
  you definitely noticed it in the inner city traffic . 
  whoops . 
  corrected . 
  thanks for letting me know .

  on a related note : [ greatest spelling ever ] ( http://gotireland.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/irish-road-signs1.jpg ), 
  * they love opposing authority so much they consider it non-optional to cross the street whenever they please . 
  * together with the scots they have the most beautiful and vivid folk music tradition , people will continue to sing in the pub a capella even when the musicians are done at night . 
  * incredibly helpful people , wonderful friendly people , extremely chatty and easy to get along with - and yet they have a huge singles looking for someone festival scene , because the young ( and not so young ) people apparently have difficulties finding a partner . 
  * probably the funniest people i have ever encountered , and yet there seems to be a huge suicide problem . 
  us ( newly arrived on the off coast island ) : excuse us , where are we allowed to pitch our tent ? 
  islander : where'er yous like !, 
  us : oh great , we hoped to camp by the light house !,

  it 's dangerous !, 
  us : why ?
