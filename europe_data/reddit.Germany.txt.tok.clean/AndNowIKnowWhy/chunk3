  religiosly motivated or sugarcoated wars seized to exist . 
  the gloves came off , expansionism showed it 's ugly and pricey face and the desire to give your life for someone else 's family name shrunk to zero . 
  it 's easier to mobilize troups in the name of religion , just ask this [ bloke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pope_urban_ii ) . 
  you just described all religions ever . 
  best part : the thing most of them are selling , afterlife bliss , is non-refundable . 
  soundest business model ever . 
  thank you for this in-depth answer and the insight . 
  if i imagine myself beeing in your position , i would be horribly embarrassed and angry . 
  from the outside perspective , i 'm horrified that such a huge part of this was a `` joke/revenge/punish vote '' . 
  how can people in the 21st century say things like `` i did n't think my vote would matter '' ? 
  i 'm mystified , i do get those that ca n't be bothered voting somehow , but actually getting up and voting against your conviction ? 
  err ? 
  seriously , i have talked to my friends and we mostly feel two emotions : anger , but mostly we have utter compassion and feel sorry for those who have been dragged into this mess . 
  it could have easily been us , in a way . 
  in germany , we 're taught over and over again how the third reich came to be , what played into the build up beforehand . 
  not just in history classes , we also read novels comparable to the wave which allow us a glimpse into how easily one can slip downwards within a very short time frame . 
  we 're reminded how fragile peace is and how vigilant one must fight the earliest signs of racism etc. 
  of course we still have a neonazi problem and dumbass nationalists , but this [ music video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmqkv5ctuoy ) pretty much reflects the views of virtually every one i know . 
  to quote it : `` we have an election to vote for the best , but we see it more like an iq-test '' and : `` trust our teutonic expertise , we know where assholery leads to '' so in a way , we 've been there . 
  few who actually have are still alive , but we 've all been there mentally . 
  we are still dealing with the consequences on a daily basis . 
  i 've received shitty comments from leavers like this one :  yeah sod off , not surprising a german wants to repeat stuff enough so people listen and want to unify europe , are you able to even go a century without trying to take over europe and ruin shit ? 
  that 's your reality as a german , threads hardly need more than 3 comments to include a nazi-pun ... 
  it 's part of our identity to accept that responsibility . 
  the thing is , we have been educated so thoroughly against the mentality that was the breeding ground for the third reich that we react pretty disgusted and shocked whenever someone taps into that energy to gather political power . 
  is the brexit the same ? 
  of course not . 
  but it 's the symptom of a unsolidary , egoistic , self-serving and clueless attitude that leads to a climate that ... makes people very vulnerable for demagogues ? 
  yes . 
  it does n't serve tolerance and cooperation . 
  i 'm so thankful and happy to live in this peaceful and united era . 
  this move is an indicator of a very scary development , and like police dogs we can smell the trouble from miles . 
  i just hope the other nationalist dorks do n't manage to be as effective as in the uk and that people remember to see the bigger picture and how precious we need to treat all the achievements that led to the eu . 
  all you can do is now play the cards you got dealt . 
  i do n't envy you . 
  pm me if there 's anything i can do for you . 
  exactly . 
  he was a journalist , so manipulation and rhetorics are his strong suit . 
  it 's understandable that eu countries , that the members and citizens have very personal reactions , though . 
  people who literally say [ `` i did n't think my count would vote '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-anger-bregret-leave-voters-protest-vote-thought-uk-stay-in-eu-remain-win-a7102516.html ) and [ google `` what is the eu '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pnflr/the_british_are_frantically_googling_what_the_eu/ ) gave us the finger and now want to declare it a [ national independance day ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/northamerican/comments/4pmym6/ukips_farage_calls_for_june_23_to_be_called/ ) because they regained their `` freedom '' . 
  all this while not realizing that the uk hat a shitton of priviliges which allowed them to be a taxhaven and generate revenues not by beeing productive but by working the financial market . 
  they 'll rub their eyes in horror soon enough . 
  because not the very rich will feel the very tangible consequences , but [ all those that expected immigration to stop instantly , that expected to rejoice in their former glory as the empire without sunset , those that now feel england is `` back on the map '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pq4ot/in_barnsley_70_of_the_population_voted_to_leave/ ) and can now focus on [ `` their real friends '' ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pljkj/eu_referendum_nigel_farage_disowns_vote_leave/ ) seriously , meanwhile others bite their tongue and focus on cooperation and compromises to achieve the best for as many as possible and not just oneself . 
  and * that * is hard work . 
  it means fighting against one 's own selfishness every fucking day . 
  it takes real heroes to fight for this idea . 
  so forgive us if the rest of us feels towards england like that one pesky cousin who demands more from grans testament and decides not to agree to selling the house and instead let it rot just to spite everybody . 
  some people , and sometimes whole countries have a hard time beeing teamplayers , and as of now , 52 % of the uk chose a bunch of [ fantasies that were all designed to strike their ego ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4prvvn/three_brexit_promises_campaigners_had_wriggled/ ) . 
  i really like the english , about 48 % . 
  the rest can feck off and bathe in those non-existing 350 m # / week for the nhs . 
  i 'm sorry it 's not easy to stay neutral . 
  i agree with you , op , but you can not ask the citizens of the eu to ignore what this referendum implies . 
  ouch , man . 
  alrighty , mate . 
  only the clueless loud mouth up-and-coming-ones always question things others worked decades for . 
  i 'll say it again : felling a tree takes seconds , regrowing one decades and centuries . 
  ahh , my bad . 
  that makes it completely ok ... 
  these people , man . 
  it 's always scary to be reminded of the fact that the racists are all among us . 
  wait which country again colonized , vandalized and brutalized region after region and killed millions of indigenous people in the process ? 
  you get off your high horse and stop just beeing against shit but try your hand at something constructive , dude . 
  it 's not a sports event !, 
  this affects their livelihood , the jobs , education and pensions . 
  they will suffer very hard for the [ stupidity of those who believed this liar ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-result-nigel-farage-nhs-pledge-disowns-350-million-pounds-a7099906.html ), 
  that 's just pure perfection, 
  very good points . 
  those that have a positive view of the eu need to become more vocal . 
  the biggest strength of the division-sowers is their loud demagogic rhetoric . 
  if their hate speech is all people get to hear , the will become riled up at some point . 
  yeah neverending growth is such a naive , destructive and dangerous notion . 
  that was a brilliant article which delivered a lot of good context . 
  hey man , remember , you guys are amazingly resourceful , that will carry you through difficult times . 
  i have heard of people reacting shocked ( that it went through ) and resenting their leave-vote . 
  is that true ? 
  i wondered how accurate the coverage is and whether that it might distort how many think like that . 
  because who on earth votes for something they do n't want to happen ? 
  right now , it is a mere referendum . 
  as of yet , nothing legal has been signed , nothing binding towards the eu . 
  who knows what the next month or the next 2 years will actually happen . 
  i 'm sure the other countries will adjust their relations and diplomacy somehow , but that 's the politicians ' problem . 
  maybe there wo n't be changes for you in the end , because the public might change their mind and the 50th wo n't be invoked . 
  already hearing that the boe will pump 27 years of membership fees into the economy just to stabilize it might wake a few up . 
  yeah , i can only imagine the sense of helplessness when you have to eat the shit a selfish and scared generation has served you . 
  i 've seen it posted by so many - the fact that they wo n't have to endure the repercussions ( as the younger ones do ) is the cruelest detail . 
  i 'm honestly sorry for you guys . 
  the health care system will suffer , the public services such as police & infrastructure will suffer , education will suffer . 
  the poorer will feel it harshly , for the richer ones little will change as usually . 
  it just sucks . 
  oh no , i like the english !, 
  it 's your representatives who always enforced a special treatment and whatnot . 
  i totally sympathize with all those who do n't feel represented by the fear-mongering , power-hungry , short-sighted nationalists . 
  the irony is that they are to stupid to understand what they are casting away . 
  the eu is an amazing adventure in cooperation ( faaar from perfect ) that took decades ( actually somehow centuries ) to develop . 
  it 's almost like watching children trying their hand at politics , like watching lord of the flies . 
  it 's like a tree : it takes so long to grow but is felled in seconds . 
  but once it 's down , you 'll realize there 's no glue gun to mend the mistake . 
  in exchange for very ephemeral benefits . 
  i 'm definitely done with this whole special treatment of the uk . 
  their tax haven status came with a high price tag for the rest .
