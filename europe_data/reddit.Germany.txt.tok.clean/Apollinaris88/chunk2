  especially in the south . 
  other than that lamb and [ s\u00fclze ( aspic ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aspic ) is pretty big . 
  we also have alot of czech - eastern traditional dishes in germany , too . 
  robert schuman and jacques delors . 
  i that order as well . 
  robert schuman and jean monnet with their idea of the european coal and steal community found an elegant solution to a 1000 year old problem in europe : `` if you let the german tibes unite they will be too big and strong for one other european country on its onw to handle them . '', 
  cardinal-duc de richelieu et de fronsac solved thism problem with 30 years of war on german soil . 
  thanks to the importance of coal and steel europe finally had a mechanism to achieve lasting peace, 
  well , if by hero we mean a person that achieved something meaningful for germany or the german people you could name a few rather important characters that you could call ` german heros ' : * ** early middle ages : ** [ charlemagne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlemagne ) .

  * ** 1500-1700 : ** [ martin luther ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_luther ) .

  the german people went through alot after the war but , with the help of the allied forces and the international community , were able to rebuild the country and turned it into the strong nation-state germany is today .

  sup guys ? 
  lol, 
  the comment ? 
  i dont see it ... 
  c'mon all little genocide never killed nobody . 
  yiu are right . 
  i jzst double checked it . 
  guess a small german news station pulled of a cnn there . 
  i heared that every household has a army rifle so in case of an invasion every fucking citizen can fight for the country . 
  the policy areas which the eu covers tend to be quite abstract and/or undramatic . 
  a lot of the eu competencies , if put back into national governments , would still receive no coverage . 
  two examples of eu policy that should find coverage in any eu member states ' national news [ 1 ] ( http://right2water.eu/news ) and [ 2 ] ( http://www.saveourseeds.org/en/dossiers/eu-seed-regulation.html ) the lines of accountability in the eu have been really unclear i would agree with you on that when it comes to the adopted pieces of legislation but for those commission proposals ive mentioned the accountability can clearly be traced back to the resonsible dgs for [ 1 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/barnier/about/mandate/index_en.htm ) and [ 2 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/borg/index_en.htm ) edit : too stupid to get the quotations right , sorry, 
  [ they estimate 11 billion in damage ] ( http://www.zeit.de/news/2013-06/07/d-dihk-fuerchtet-durch-flut-schaden-von-mehr-als-elf-milliarden-euro-07131409 ) edit : translation of headline : dihk fears flood damage might exeed eleven billion euros . 
  had too much coffee :p, 
  i am disappointed that they wouldnt even mention the flooding in central europe . 
  nah , i kid you :d . 
  thats so funny . 
  so long , free movement of labour :d . with 216 million people working in the eu on 600.000 eu citizens moved to another eu country to work . 
  21 % of them went to the uk . 
  the pattern is clear . 
  every country should work on their second language !, 
  english ftw !, 
  thank you imf ... ? 
  this is a quote from the eu citizenship report 2013 : `` action 12 : the commission will : - promote eu citizens ' awareness of their eu citizenship rights , and in particular their electoral rights , by launching on europe day in may 2014 a handbook presenting those eu rights in clear and simple language ; - propose constructive ways to enable eu citizens living in another eu country to fully participate in the democratic life of the eu by maintaining their right to vote in national elections in their country of origin ; and - explore in 2013 ways of strengthening and developing the european public space , based on existing national and european structures , to end the current fragmentation of public opinion along national borders . '', 
  the last point directly refers to this post . 
  [ this is the core element of my critique ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/pressroom/docs/proposal_aphp_en.pdf ) . 
  but [ this ] ( http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2012/november/concerns-over-borg-grow-ahead-of-hearing/75655.aspx ) is another reason i strongly regret the desicion to make him commissioner, 
  deutschbro gave the lols edit : gave me * - . -, 
  you want to know whats the worst thing about all of this ? 
  he didnt even make it into the evening news nor into any other of the biggest german news sources . 
  he is so much out of the race that the main german news wont even mention him . 
  all they see is [ `` mutti-merkel '' `` helping '' to build a dam ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/politik/die-flut-staerkt-merkels-image-article10764471.html ), 
  malta gave the eu one of the [ worst commissioners ever ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tonio_borg ) . 
  how can portuguese wine be that cheap if labour costs are so high ? 
  does it fall under the cap and is subsidized ? 
  you mean something like a. ... . `` fiscal union '' ... yes , he said it ... bad word , i know, 
  yes , germany has the biggest solar panel production market in europe . 
  only for the reason that the german consumers got immense subsidies from government when buying solar panels . 
  that made the german market artificially boom from 2004 until the end of 2008 when the subsidies ended . 
  after that most firms , q-cells among the more popular examples , went bankrupt . 
  today , the german photovoltaic industry is basically only represented by two firms . 
  solarworld and schott . 
  these two firms are just not worth the problems arising from the anti-dumping tariffs . 
  just consider the size of the german car industry in china . 
  german politicians opposed the proposal because it might harm the trade relations to one of germanys most important import and export partners . 
  that is a much larger account than a few thousand jobs in germany . 
  [ germany was one of the states opposed to the tariffs ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22766639 ), 
  wonder what kept the germans from posting here . 
  try the german [ `` grey bread '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/mischbrot-1.jpg ) . 
  this bread is best with hearty toppings ( ham , salami , cheese ) picture is not as fancy as the others but i guess thats how we germans are :d . 
  wasting time was certainly a big part of the bargaining process . 
  wasting money was the thing everyone involved tried to avoid . 
  the ela kept streaming into he country ... thats true .
