  nafta etc. ), 
  with countries in the americas you would get a pretty similar pictures . . 
  thanks , i did n't know that the irish script was actually more concise . 
  obligatory : fuck the english !, 
  nice going poland . 
  which sectors is this ? 
  i know it is in there but what else ? 
  switzerland why you breaking the germanic fox triplet ?!, 
  switzerland stahp !, 
  missing a column for `` nato operation '' or something like that . 
  * inventors of pilsener and i will be forever grateful . 
  * praha is one of the greatest and most beautiful cities on earth . 
  * formerly called bohemia and one of me rivals in europa universalis iv  ( i play poland-lithuania ) * czech streets ... 
  chipotle . 
  craving it right now actually . 
  a more reasonable voting public who is not content voting in `` mutti '' for another 20 years would be great as well . . - . - edit : he = who, 
  harvesting oil sands ? 
  no thanks . . 
  so much pollution and waste of water and energy . 
  i would prefer we keep trying to make renewable work and have nice electric cars . 
  thank you . 
  was that big news ? 
  because over here i have n't heard about it . . its only been election this , election that for month . 
  i do n't get it . 
  what did i miss ? 
  why is this a statement against russia ? 
  no it did n't . 
  there was only one black + green state government ( landesregierung ) so far in hamburg and it broke down prematurely after two years . 
  i think it is . 
  think about what this allows companies to do . 
  they will have an array of premium services that you pay extra for ( like video on demand , voip etc. ), 
  and a couple of huge sites will also be able to afford being included ( facebook , google etc. ) . 
  the rest of the internet will be slower and slower and only access to these sites will be comfortable and fast . 
  in addition the internet will be `` sanitized '' more and more with filters and the like . 
  people will start using the internet like tv , clicking on buttons to take them to a service like twitter . 
  innovation , which is in large part dependent on net neutrality will slowly die down , because of the high access cost to the `` fast '' internet , which will over-time become the main internet . 
  this has also very deprecating effects on the usefulness as a democratic medium of information and mobilisation . 
  there has been no common eu policy so far . 
  some countries allow it , some do n't . 
  however this sets the precedent for it becoming wide-spread . 
  many countries will just allow the maximum possible under eu law . . lucky for you , the netherlands is the only country with a net-neutrality law , so at least in your country it will probably not have such a detrimental effect . 
  although , i am not sure if `` prioritisation '' might be a means to circumvent your net-neutrality law ? 
  and there we go fucking net neutrality right in the ass . . `` prioritisation '' . . thats really terrible , that the door will be opened wide for this kind of thing . . 
  the roaming stuff is nice though . 
  they do n't really talk about politics that much though . . 
  here are some real political options that germany should take : use the tremendous influence at eu level to immediate and until further notice halt the eu/us trade agreement negotiations . 
  there is no trust and we are apparently neither partners nor `` friends '' . 
  there can be no free trade zone on this basis . 
  immediately opt out of the swift agreement and the passenger data exchange . 
  yes flights will be grounded which would actually make a large portion of the public aware that this is a scandal of tremendous proportions and would put pressure on the us to actually change its behavior because business men would pressure them ... there is money at stake . 
  europe can survive without flights to the us for a couple of weeks . . 
  this would be a clear signal that we are serious about civil rights and not being spied on . . 
  no it does n't in a multi-party system . 
  vote pirate party , or left or green if you believe in neither merkel nor steinbr\u00fcck . 
  you do have a choice , do n't let anyone tell you that you do n't . 
  really ? 
  although most 2012 and all 2013 data is still projection it is not looking much better . 
  although gdp grew just so slightly , unemployment also grew in 2012 and has only seen a very minor decrease so far in 2013 that could be seasonal . 
  further both gross and net national debt is still growing and staggeringly high ( even net debt is over 100 % gdp ) .

  i might have been lucky and only seen a good `` sample '' . 
  * [ dylan morran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dylan_moran ) is a great irish stand-up comedian and one of the funniest people alive . 
  * it is huge in dublin . 
  * they got fucked by the financial crisis ( or more specifically : the banks and their clueless and corrupt politicians ) more than almost anyone else in europe . 
  their social security and health care was almost completely bankrupted . 
  poverty is on the rise . 
  recovery is going slow . 
  * * i tell me ma when i go home , the boys wo n't leave the girls alone . . * ( love the folk music ) * in stark contrast to england , many cute girls . 
  yes it is the governments business , public health always has been but this is especially true in a healthcare system such as ours where we are all paying for the smokers . 
  while it is clearly nonsensical to make such things illegal , the use of harmful substances should be discouraged through education of youths and regulated through the ban on the psychological tricks of advertisement . 
  people of course should be free to smoke , drink , toke etc. 
  but ( especially young people ) should be protected to a certain extent from being manipulated into it . 
  ** europe-wide top level education ** build schools and universities as needed ( max . 
  15 children and at least 2 teachers per class , highly individualized , highly digitized and gamified ) free incl . 
  university and living costs in every country . 
  high standard , possibly including subsidies to a dual education approach to non-university education that includes high-quality vocational training . 
  would take about 50 years to fully realize but pay of by a factor of 6-8 . 
  europe wide smart-grid ( i have no idea what that would cost to be honest ) . 
  one of the most important steps to prepare for volatile multi-source energy infrastructure of the future . 
  erasmus for everyone , to build the european spirit . 
  music is * serious business * in sweden , be it eurodance in the past or eurovision today . 
  ( i learned this from the `` scandinavia and the world '' comic ) alcohol is very expensive , so they got snus which is some sort of tobacco you chew that burns away your gums and makes you a little high . 
  many swedish girls are so hot that they ca n't stop themselves from making out with each other even if they are straight and there are guys around . 
  they are very peaceful now ( not even in nato ) but had an empire once and almost invaded my hometown hamburg a couple of hundred years ago , but `` we '' paid them off . 
  well , you ca n't do everything right can you ? 
  i have and it really is absurdely large and very confusing that the large coin is worth so little . . ^ ^, 
  good , i would totally support a gradual withdrawal . 
  its fucking annoying to have so many bulky coins in my wallet at times anyway . 
  estonia is a model eu country in many respects ( low national debt for example ) so do n't worry about ball size , 
  what is it that latvia says `` mine '' about ? 
  and is the flag slovenia is thinking about ? 
  signed . 
  this should be on the front page . 
  water  open internet ( yes that is very important as well . . still ) . 
  no you do n't . 
  but you are if you are uploading a picture of the eifel tower illuminated at night on facebook . 
  thanks . 
  it 's on its way !, 
  could a native dutch speaker please check if this is correct ? 
  want to send it this afternoon .
