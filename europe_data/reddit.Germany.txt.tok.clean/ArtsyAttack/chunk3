  the people who decided this must 've known it would piss off the israelis big time . 
  usually we do n't bother building homes for poor people except in the most dire cases , like after natural desasters . 
  interesting . 
  i 'd always thought germany would have to be lower due to the brain drain that occured before/during/after ww2 . 
  thanks man i 'm too lazy to burden my fire-mule with yet another addon , but he should handle one more blocklist just fine . 
  from [ that ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35813470 ) article :  breivik 's world   three cells - one for sleeping , one for studying , one for  exercising - plus daily access to exercise yard  can play video games , watch tv and read newspapers has a computer ( without internet access )  can prepare his own food and do his own washing  has phone conversations with a `` female friend ''  contact with prison staff , lawyers , a priest , health professionals  has declined to play chess with volunteers  built a gingerbread house as part of a prison competition how would you do solitary confinement more humane than that ? 
  i wish i had that reddit suite thingy so i could tag you as `` pizza-heretic '' . 
  the circlejerk is real . 
  i had to dig far too deep to find this . 
  it definitely is . 
  among my circle , which is pretty left/green , it sparked a major discussion about how much tolerance is too much . 
  it 's actually the other way round . 
  such excavation sites can be found all over the planet , while many biomes were endemic to that part of the world ( not in europe , but in other countries ) but had to be sacrificed to produce more fossile fuels . 
  yea , but their discussion group was completely subverted by actual pedophiles who used the party structures to `` trade '' boys . 
  [ english source ] ( https://newrepublic.com/article/120379/german-green-party-pedophilia-scandal ) . 
  today 's programme is different ; i 'd say they 've dealt with that particular piece of history better than other parties have . 
  especially the christian social union in bavaria definitely played part in sweeping the sex scandals of the church under the rug . 
  that was back in the 90 's . 
  [ english source ] ( https://newrepublic.com/article/120379/german-green-party-pedophilia-scandal ) . 
  please expand on that . 
  i 'd like to know how many people who up - or downvoted this actually read and understood the article . 
  my guess is most only saw the headline . 
  we started doing that in [ 1952 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/parteiverbot#bundesrepublik_deutschland ) . 
  they abolished the ideological offspring of the nsdap and four years later the communist party . 
  part of why they 're preparing to ban the npd is because the party 's organizations have been used to plan criminal activities . 
  i 'm completely behind destroying the command structure of right-wing extremists . 
  yea , they 're pretty great . 
  they 're vegetables not trying to pretend to be meat . 
  and that 's all i ask for . 
  i 'm vegetarian and i ca n't stomach these abominations . 
  do n't ask me why they 're becoming so popular . 
  hm ... yea , should 've given proper credit . 
  go fuck your selfie !, 
  his [ proposal ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/integration-fluechtlinge-de-maiziere-101.html ) will include sanctions for not participating in german learning courses and refusing work offers . 
  hartz iv is only paid to people who worked for a minimum of one or two years , i 'm not entirely sure . 
   to prevent any speculation , the suspect is descibed as ethnically finnish . 
  i thought they only comment on people 's nationality if it 's important to the case ? 
  or is that a germany-only thing . 
  [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4c0y87/secret_eu_plan_to_deport_80000_afghans/d1edoxt ) has another explanation for what i called a `` bribe '' , but yea , most of the downvotes for you and me are probably from people who just want to see brown people thrown out of europe . 
  possible . 
  i 'll reserve judgement until the plans are officially made public . 
   the afghan elite will be rewarded with university places in europe that 's a bribe . 
  the elites do n't need the aid , they 're rich enough . 
  looking at afghan history it 's probably more anecdotal than representative . 
  let 's say it : we 're trying to bribe the afghan elites . 
  bribe them for letting us bring people into a developing warzone . 
  i ca n't find any angle from which this is a good thing . 
  even if you 're in favour of deporting afghans , it 's still a terrible precedence and will lead to further demands down the line . 
  what do you even want to say with that ? 
  are you implying the people who 're living in that warzone are at fault for being bombed ? 
  because , you know , they probably did n't decide to live in a warzone . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  the one 20km from where i was born ( gundremmingen ) was tested against armor-penetrating weapons and failed the test . 
  i 'd hope the power plant itself is better protected than that . 
  some german nuclear power plants store the used-up stuff nearby , is it the same in belgium ? 
  it 's worth a try . 
  when the german state was still young , the churches had a lot of political influence . 
  in order to wrestle that control away from them , bismarck set in place a series of laws which mandated a certain level of state influence on the churces . 
  see [ kulturkampf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kulturkampf ) , especially the [ may laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kulturkampf#may_laws ) . 
  we 've had refugees here before , during the balkan wars . 
  when those wars were over , most of 'em left . 
  why does everyone assume all 1 million people will stay here for the rest of their lives ? 
  that seals it , helsinki will be on the list for my next holiday destination !, 
  taking my time , walking around , soaking in the atmosphere is what i prefer doing when on holiday !, 
  a documentary i do n't remember the name of told me that retail margins in germany are the tightest of pretty much all of europe . 
  german `` poppen '' is a slang word for `` having sex '' , that might be the root . 
   if yes , ok . no , no , no . 
  it would be `` eu companies get a say in us laws '' , not `` democratically elected eu gremiums get a say in us laws '' . 
  this is still not acceptable . 
  yea , but * my * behaviour follows moral rules that prevent me from having forced sex with people . 
  do n't have any concrete numbers , but consider this : we have probably around 90 % straight couples . 
  these 90 % do n't manage to reach 2 childs on average . 
  if we now forced the 10 % gay couples to mix up , they probably would n't get to 2 childs on average among them either , so their overall effect on population would be negligible . 
  bring in stuff like depression from being forced to live with someone you do n't sexually desire , and it might have a negative effect on population numbers due to suicides . 
  if i see a lesbian couple , that 's two less persons i could make babies with ( polygamy aside ) . 
  if i see a gay couple , that 's two potential rivals less . 
  maybe the # 0.23 is what the factory pays . 
  i do n't know about taxes in bangladesh , but i 'd assume they have some kind of income tax . 
  are you implying we should n't judge them because of their culture ? 
  if you 've got to blame it on anyone , blame it on the red/green government before her . 
  police says he was turkish and had previously been under investigation for drugs , counterfeit money and gambling . 
  fucking low-effort trolls . 
  ah , the old days when trolls would at least invest half an hour into their post , digging up sources to support their aisine claims and type out novel-lenght essays ... 
  since you did n't take more than one minute to take some quotes and slap your opinion under them , i will extend the same courtesy towards you :  nope yes . 
   you 're lying you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   debatable like your entire post . 
  might be the case , too . 
  ca n't tell from the article . 
   upwards of 85 percent of the deterioration of the secondary competences can be explained by an increasing proportion of students ** who immigrated after regular school start ** and that this student group had a worse performance than other students . 
  ( from the english translation linked by op ) frankly , that sounds different from the headline . 
  ~ ~ if you 've missed out 2/3rds of the school year , you will of course have worse grades compared to someone who was there from the start . 
  and of course it would be mainly immigrants who arrive later in the year . ~ ~ seems i misinterpreted that part , see responses below . 
   the jist of your post : `` anything i disagree with is disastrous '' . 
  i disagree with a lot more than that , what i highlighted was only the points i 'm absolutely certain would have a huge negative impact . 
   so a re-institution of a policy which existed only a few years ago would be a disaster ? 
  please tell me what disastrous conditions germany was in a few years ago before mandatory service was abolished . 
  yes it would be . 
  students do n't expect to get drafted , if you do it now they 'll be even more reluctant . 
  as a result the bundeswehr will have to deal with even more complaints etc. 
  also , all these people will be missing from university and ausbildungspl\u00e4tze .
