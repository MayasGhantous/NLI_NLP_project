   no it wo n't . 
   source ? 
  their party 's programme . 
   why ? 
  are you just throwing around one-word questions to waste my time ? 
  because if you do n't take part in bologna reforms , your country 's universities do n't get to take part in all those cool exchange and cooperation programs . 
   germany is already ahead of the curve when it comes to renewable energy so i do n't see this as being particularly bad , and certainly not `` disastrous '' . 
  right now we 're still able to put pressure on others to catch up . 
  once we stop pushing forward , we 'll either be overtaken by other countries and will have to import their clean technology in the future ; or everyone stops caring and we steer seeingly into climate disaster . 
  * re-institution of mandatory military service ( because we already have a lack of azubis ) * stopping germany 's participation in schengen area ( will lead to millions in economical damage for baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ) * schuldenbremse : not taking on further investments would be dangerous to our economy , since foreign demand has faltered . 
  * keeping women out of the workforce * allowing parents to `` educate '' their children at home * keeping non-straight people out of school books ( will contribute to the next generation of people growing up just as intolerant * taking back bologna-reforms ( would lead to german universities becoming internationally isolated ) * lowering taxes for enterprises * stopping subventions for renewable energies * stopping attempts at lowering our co2-emissions and that 's just baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , i did n't even bother with the drivel from more `` extreme '' states . 
  we 'd probably be refugees if that happened . 
  do n't see why , though , if someone were to attack us it would probably be for our industrial prowess ; so they could n't just carpet-bomb everything or drive out the people . 
  if it was , say , aliens fighting a war of annihilation against mankind then yea , i 'd probably fight . 
  but as long as i personally can make it away safely i do n't see the point in staying and throwing away my life . 
  i 'd very much prefer to just live and continue to care about living . 
  i am aware that at any given moment i could be killed in a lot of different ways , so i 'm not about to add yet another one on top of that . 
  germany would be pretty much defensless , yea , but tbh we on our own could n't stand up to an attack right now either . 
   can you please explain how its a good thing having people you fundamentally disagree with passing laws ? 
  having the afd pass laws would be a fucking desaster for the countries and for the party itself , too . 
  i 'm guessing many people voted afd as a `` fuck you '' to everyone else , because they were certain the afd wo n't end up as a part of any government . 
  in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , [ 70 % ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/uvotechart-4927%7e_v-videowebl.jpg ) voted afd due to disappointment with other parties , rather than due to their program . 
  in rhineland-palatine , it were [ 62 % ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/uvotechart-4879%7e_v-videowebl.jpg ) . 
  i ca n't very well have any ill will against my grandparents , but the issue remains : they enabled a system that killed some 20 million people . 
  i will not be caught dead ( heh ) repeating that mistake . 
  besides my aversion to dieing , i also simply do n't want to put myself in a situation where i 'd have to kill someone . 
  see , my grandparents were n't stupid people . 
  they were n't inherently bad , either . 
  they certainly were n't out for french or polnish blood . 
  and still , my grandfather got tricked or brainwashed into taking part in a war that was flat out wrong to take part in . 
  so i asked myself , how can i make sure i never become part of a genocidical machine ? 
  with the huge influence media has over all of us , they could make me believe i was `` fighting the good fight '' , that i was `` one of the good guys '' , even if in truth , we were n't . 
  so i came to the conclusion that the only way i could evade this fate was to flat out refuse to touch or design a weapon ( with the possible exception of self-defense , but i 'm afraid a weapon would n't do me any good either since i would n't know how to use it ) . 
  you 're saying you feel this connection to your country . 
  would you say that life without it simply would n't be worth living ? 
  because that 's pretty much the only way i can see myself risking my life for something : if living without it would be worse than death . 
  and i have n't found anything or anyone i care that deeply about . 
  in baw\u00fc , [ 70 % ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/uvotechart-4927~_v-videowebl.jpg ) of afd voters voted due to disappointment with other parties . 
  in rhineland-palatine , [ 62 % ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/uvotechart-4879~_v-videowebl.jpg ) voted afd out of protest . 
  the article did n't contain any data for sachsen-anhalt . 
  nope . 
  life here is nice , death would n't be , dying would be horrible . 
  my grandfathers also served in ww2 , did n't do them any good . 
  plus i 'd make a horrible soldier ; much better to put me behind a desk and tell me to invent stuff . 
  i love living in germany , and i like the culture here . 
  i still would n't describe myself as a patriot . 
  patriots usually are ready to die for their country , right ? 
  not me . 
  definitely moving to australia if worse comes to worst . 
  stayed with an aussie who said he does n't understand some stuff about lidl ( like why they often sell random crap ) , but still goes there sometimes . 
  it really surprised me . 
  hitler was vegetarian , so that 's covered already . 
  nope , laptop at school . 
  but you might be right , could have been the school 's filter rather than a government one . 
  mate , when i was on exchange in britain , my tagesschau.de article and web.de email website both got blocked because of `` suspected child porn '' activity . 
  your own government fucks with internet wayyyy more than the eu ever did . 
  maybe you 've seen it already , but in case you have n't ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/49n0wm/in_europe_youll_need_a_vpn_to_see_real_google/d0t5qls, 
  i agree , and yet i ca n't help but participate . 
  no way i would 've passed chemistry and construction and design without material shared on facebook . 
  i do n't agree with your first point , we do have a german culture . 
  thing is , i do n't see it dieing due to migrants anytime soon . 
  rest of your post is pretty much spot-on . 
  i almost did n't want to upvote you , that 's mean . 
  it 's called deutschlandsim , but if i remembered correctly that deal was only on offer for a short time . 
  maybe it 'll come around again . 
  200 mb , 50 minutes free call and 50 sms for 3 $ per month . 
  it 's a pretty good deal , as i have wifi almost everywhere i go . 
  i 've only once actually used up those 200mb . 
  what is a backdoor migrant ? 
  sounds porn-y . 
  what happens when all the reasonable people leave ? 
  it 's the difference between `` punching downwards '' and `` punching upwards '' . 
  immigrants and refugees have a difficult time already , and each such piece of news fuels someone 's hate to the point where they 're ready to commit crimes against the next foreigner . 
  like , after the colonia crisis on new year 's eve , people chased several middle-eastern looking men through the streets ( although most of the accused so far are of northern african descent ) . 
  so yea , hoping the rapists were white is simply hoping for the violence to end here . 
  because noone will rally against native germans/austrians when several of them committed crimes . 
  one successful attack from a muslim extremist who lived in germany . 
  but there were quite a few attacks outside of germany that originated here ; for example a few of the guys who committed the 9/11 attacks were from hamburg . 
  also various suicide bombers joined is from germany . 
  it is in the boar 's nature to indiscriminately destroy and eat stuff . 
  it is in human 's nature to defend what they built . 
  eh , throughout bavaria there 's a shooting club in every small town . 
  but / u/fluchtpunkt 's numbers sound solid . 
  there are certain arguments to be made for having a government that tailors the rules to a small set of people rather than having to find the smallerst common denominator for a huge body of citizens . 
  did n't we agree that satire is allowed to do everything that does n't directly call for violence ? 
  y' know , after the charlie hebdo attacks ? 
  this thought is strangely comforting . 
  we may not have been able nor willing to sentence them , but they are their own judge and torturer . 
  i do n't agree with that reasoning , that 's why i put the `` would '' there . 
  but people chose to be fans of a certain club . 
  they stuck with them through wins and losses ( mostly , i 'd like to think ) and cheered them on . 
  that 's a little different form being born in a country , because you had no active choice in which womb you were conceived . 
  with that kind of reasoning the only ones allowed national pride would be the ones who actively worked to gain citizenship of a foreign country . 
  mate , even our nazis have started working together with nazis from other european countries . 
  how much more do we need ? 
  that 's pretty much describing me . 
  when seeing women in a sauna or similar , i do n't go apeshit crazy though , and expect the same from others . 
  it was n't just looking , but rude comments and apparently groping . 
  but excluding every single male refugee probably was n't the best reaction . 
  how long till he can get his 72 virgins ??
