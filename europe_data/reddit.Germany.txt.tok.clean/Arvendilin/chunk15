  if you do , we would be the good guys this time , sounds kinda nice = 3, 
  i heard them so often from the npd , they even send you fliers if they think you look german enough !, 
  soo yea not much help was needed to remember this shit xd, 
  idk about you swabians but down here in bavaria we make tons of holocaust jokes , i do n't think there is anything that ca n't be joked about my friend , 
  wow , i forgot how nationalistic poles tend to be haha oh well have fun living in your fantasy world where poland is the center of the universe < 3, 
  well there is one thing we germans are jealous of !, 
  while we at 9:30 in the morning are wondering where our knoppers went , the poles seemingly out of nowhere got a fresh one , apparently from a german store  ( yes its an old joke about poles stealing stuff :0 deal with it ), 
  sure but a nazi is more like a clock you smash on the ground so much that noone can read anything off of it , it therefor beeing correct no times a day since it went completely off the scale , 
  sure but then you have to wonder if this march is really just a few bad apples or if there might a bit more in there , 
  they said that , like was that part of the big chant ? 
  if so they lost all support they had from me hahhahaha, 
  not really greece ca n't even provide food or shelter to all of them now ... 
  did n't cause it , they were comming anyways all we said was we will not change the rules for asylum no matter how many come , and that we wo n't send them back to greece or italy , since these countries were about to collapse/are collapsing under the sheer number of asylum seekers ... 
  and i ca n't vote your representatives out of office when they do n't want to accept quotas , so yea, 
  gronkh was okay , i watched him when he had 800 subscribers , but i stopped when he started to only upload minecraft anymore , damn that was a long time ago , i wonder how much he has changed since then haha =p, 
  actually this is an example of how non-multiculture fails , because germany in the 60s and 70s when the turks all came was building separate schools and separate housing to keep turks and their culture away in a little corner in germany , so they could integrate and form a multiculture with germany !, 
  this just shows that if you try your hardest to not let people integrate , then people wo n't integrate , which should ahve been logical from the start , but the 60s were a wild time i guess ... 
  nah , we created this problem we have to take care of it , they are germans now eventhough we tried our hardest not to let them integrate lol, 
  back in the day we tried our hardest not to let turks integrate into germany , building separate housing away from where germans lived , separate ( worse ) schools , where no german was spoken and where their kids had to go t ( there are some instances where their parents fought with tooth and nail to let their kids go to german schools and be part of german society which is laughably stupid of germany ) . 
  so what we overall learned from that is , if you try your hardest to not let a group of people integrate , then they wo n't integrate , soo maybe do n't try that :0, 
  not at all , i do n't feel guilty at all about what the nazis did , well maybe thats cuz i do n't have a nazi supporter in my family ( tho my great grandpa wanted to , his wife told him he would end up on the street if he walked with the `` mob '' ) , but yea i do n't know anyone who feels actually guilty about that really . 
  maybe acknowledging that you fucked up and are responsible for creating the currently bad situation with the turks , and therefor do n't want to do the same mistakes ( shutting them out of society creating extra places to stay creating extra schoools etc. 
  ) , and therefor learn from you mistake and do a better job next time ( be more welcoming , give them proper places to stay , let them go to your schools etc. ), 
  is actually a good thing ? 
  learning from you mistakes is one of the most important things growing up :0, 
  the ones from the balkans actually are , because its really easy to send them back , you just put them on a train , they even come here legally since its so easy to get here from there , so yea those get send abck since its cheap and not a lot of work , and those are like most of the rejeced ones ... 
  did n't invite it , tho all she ever said was that we wo n't send people back to greece or italy etc. 
  which is something our constitutional court ruled since it would be against our constitution , since the countries there ca n't provide for them anymore , so it would be inhumane ... 
  the other thing she said was that we wo n't change the criteria for asylum no matter how many come since asylum is a human right , really i did n't see an invite there, 
  i generally would aggree , but i think its too late for that now , the systems already collapsed or are near collapse , if it was 1-2 years ago your approach would be 100 % the one i would have supported , but i do n't think you can build up the systems in place when even more are coming on a daily basis while its alerady in this sad state , sadly i think we the eu , but also germany ofcourse as one of the leading countries failed miserably so far :(, 
  nah i stopped posting here once already , but the sub is in such a pathetic state and used to be so good , that it kinda saddens me , soo i 'll go down with this sinking ship aswell as with my karma i guess =p, 
  i said we are pushing for a plan to stop the boats b4 they even get onto the water , with military raids along the coast of north africa . 
  the people will defenitely take the land journey they think that europe is some kind of paradise on earth , if i thought the same about asia as my country was burning to the ground i would n't mind walking waaay too much to provide the best place for my family to stay and start a new life ... 
  well she said that in response to neo violent neo nazis protesters , she said that we wo n't change the laws about asylum no matter how many come if someone qualifies for asylum they qualify for asylum thats what she said . 
  the other part again was about not sending them back under dubliniii because the countries we would send them back to ( italy greece hungrary etc. ), 
  ca n't take care of them and are collapsing under their sheer weight , at the same time germany has pushed for a unified approach to the refuggee crisis so that no one state has to suffer too much , so no we never said we want to take everyone in , we said we would take people in that qualify and wo n't change laws about that but we at the same time want to work on a european approach that overall works best ... 
  if you forget germany is one of the countries pushing the most for stopping the boats b4 they even leave by military use in northern africa , so we are working on that . 
  also the australia approach has been critizised a lot as a human right violation and we are not an island so it does n't really work the same way for us as it works for them , there is simply an easy way to walk here compared to walking on foot towards australia ... 
  well yea , but switzerland is benefitting a lot from the common market so there is no reason to pay them , we pay money to everyone that is n't benefitting off of it , the countries that are part of the common market but not the eu are all benefitting off of it ... 
  i aggree , i think it was a complete failure of germany france denmark austria etc. 
  earlier on , we did almost nothing because it was n't our problem , and i for one would have back then if you asked me advocated for more money transfers to those states aswell as currency transfers within the euro , but again its too late for that now now we need to find a solution that hopefully works for everyone atleast better than the current one is, 
  well i 'll try to explain , what i understand and give my views on these things if thats okay !, 
  so firstly , beeing nationalistic/patriotic is looked down upon quite a bit . 
  it is seen as something people with bad education do that have no worth in their live and have to focus on something , there is a quote from arthur schopenhauer , a german philosopher which maybe explains the general feeling : `` the cheapest form of pride however is national pride . 
  for it betrays in the one thus afflicted the lack of individual qualities of which he could be proud , while he would not otherwise reach for what he shares with so many millions . 
  he who possesses significant personal merits will rather recognise the defects of his own nation , as he has them constantly before his eyes , most clearly . 
  but that poor beggar who has nothing in the world of which he can be proud , latches onto the last means of being proud , the nation to which he belongs to . 
  thus he recovers and is now in gratitude ready to defend with hands and feet all errors and follies which are its own . '' -- arthur schopenhauer so yes we are quite a bit against nationalism/patriotism , and while certainly the third reich might be in ones head , its not the main reason . 
  if you take me and many of my friends as an example ( tho we are german bavarian leftists studying at university so we might not be representative ) , we do n't like nationalism not solely because of the third reich , but because it is a stupid notion to feel good and better than others on the basis of where you are from , you did n't choose where you were born you did n't do anything for it , and like most other - isms it can make people stop think or think irrationally can help to manipulate people and make them do bad things and justify it because of nationalism , so logically a no nationalism should be better than nationalism all in all . 
  so it was more of a shut up idiot thing than a oh noes the nazis might be coming if you talk to loud thing , because honestly having a bunch of idiots starting to sing when you want to watch a game is kinda really annoying ( note that with idiots i mean that that is what they would be seen as for behaving patriotic ) for the brazil game , well while i never heard anyone say maybe we beat them too hard seriously ( tho there were a lot of jokes like that , aswell as rape jokes etc. 
  soo yea you sure she was serious and not trying to be funny and beeing super german about it ? 
  ) , but during the game i actually felt kinda a bit sorry for them and was a bit relieved that they scored on goal , football here is like religion for many people , a centerpoint in their entire life , i know that if germany was beaten 6-0 or something like that there are lots of people that would have been completely done with life for like a week , i 've seen grown men cry about a bad football game or just rage incredibly , so in a way imagining what i or others would feel like in their situation i felt kinda bad for them , especially because they were the hosts of that wc :0 could you expand on the whole how they are taugh thing ? 
  yes wwii and the nazis was the biggest topic ( which is something i like , i think every country should have its own shortcomings as the biggest topic , so the british i.e. 
  their horrible behaviour towards indigenious people ) , maybe even too much but it was not really a guilt trip , the only time i really felt bad myself was when we visited the concentration camp in 9th class because the atmosphere there was just simply awfull . 
  other than that it was not really all that emotional just cold hard facts about what happened how certain people were treated , causes and effects etc. 
  and talking about it to foreigners ( or perceive as foreigners ) or people you do n't know well is something we are very carefull about i aggree , i am much more timid when talking to my american friends than talking to my german friends in that regard , i think it has a lot to do with the internet and what we are exposed of in media aswell , like i 've been called a nazi so many times simply for beeing german so i think i 'll hold back a little on the holocaust/nazi jokes , and whenever foreigners try to talk to you about the holocaust or something it feels soo aggressive against you and germans in general , like people i know for like half a day asking me how many jews my grandpa killed is just completely tactless ... germans in general tend to be very resserved and hold back a lot when interacting with people they would n't call good friends , which might be another reason , a lot of our culture is about mutual respect etc. 
  and question like that are seen as respectless if you do n't know the other person well and not showing your respect for someone else is seen as a personal attack almost ( this whole thing is written horribly sorry , i 'm bad at explaining and its late haha ) also i would argue the same applies to other people aswell , ever tried to talk with a brit you do n't know too well about the horrors of the british empire , or with an american about unjust wars or torture ? 
  does n't work all that well :0 but from my observations/talking to people i can safely say that germans are in the top 2 group of people that make the most/best holocaust/hitler/nazi etc. 
  jokes the only group that might be better at it are israelis lol how old ? 
  people that were alive during that time can be very closed up about it because maybe they have done things they really do n't wan na talk about , but in the 60s there was like an anarchistic-hippie movement ( idk how to explain or characterise that one really ) that was all about beeing open about the past and discussing it and stuff which led to a lot of problems because the older generation wanted to just let it slide and go forgotten , but since then we 've been relatively honest and open to ourselfs , again if they do n't know you that well talking to outsiders about it can feel like a trap , because as a german it feels so incredibly easy to be just called a nazi etc. 
  by other people ( another example would be the english , there was a lot of genuine hate coming from over there and it has only ever really slowed down since 2006 ) last thing , you might not know this but it used to be a popular method of neo-nazis they used relativism , showing how other regimes were as bad or worse in order to make the nazis look less bad and then try to slowly recruit people into it once they start thinking like that . 
  there was a giant movement in western germany against relativism as it was seen as a tool of neonazis to try and make the nazis look more harmless , so there is like a build-in reflex in many germans that when you start to compare the nazis and something else they start thinking about these neonazis etc. 
  i do n't think that was ever a thing in eastern germany so it is only natural that a guy from dresden would n't have the same things in his head . 
  basically , comparing things can lead to you not taking stuff as seriously or making stuff look more harmless it is therefor better to look at everything objectively on its own for its own merrits ( or in this case horrors ) tho on a side note i would actually make the point that overall the nazis are still worse as they had the same cleansing of political dissenters ( some of the first people in concentration camps where spd politicians which was the only party that stood up to hitler in 1936 which was when he was already in control and you voted with an armed sa guy next to you , but they still voted against him and then got send to concentration camps ) , and they were waaay worse for ethnicities especially if they would have won/stayed in power for longer since their plans for eastern europe were extremely cruel worse than what they have done b4 !, 
  and lastly , do n't mistake the point i 'm making for meaning the third reich is n't a big topic in germany , it most defenitely is , it is a huge topic infact , what i am saying is , that while it might be something important and something to keep in mind we do n't base desicions off of it , no german i know would ever be like : we should do this or this , because there once were nazis and they were bad !, 
  we are actually working on this , its one of the main points merkel also focuses on , getting rid of the people that are n't accepted , back in the day noone cared cuz it would be too much money spend and there were not that many of them so it was seen as a waste of money !, 
  most are , those you do n't notice , some are n't those you notice a lot , the problem is that germany did a lot wrong with integrating turks ( setting up separate schools and separate places for them to live !, 
  ) , sooo yea kinda our own fault xd, 
  it is because we really fucked up with the turks back in the day , we set up their own getthos their own schools ( they had to fight to be able to be allowed to go to german schools ) and their own separate shit . 
  we failed so completely hard with turks , it was almost on purpose to get them to leave , but they stayed because they build their lives here , and we fucked up . 
  this is one of the main reasons people are so positive towards asylum seekers nowadays so that we do n't repeat that mistake again !, 
  not really as turkey is n't part of the dublin aggreement so greece ca n't really esnd them back :0, 
  never invited them ... 
  if you want you can tell me where she says please come over here , because she never did that , thanks, 
  wait what , thats more than we give them lol, 
  i thought greece and italy did ( they are the ones that are suffering the most because as it stands they have to take like all of them and literally ca n't deal with it anymore ) and i 'm not sure but i think france or atleast their politicians were in favor of it other than that i do n't think so . 
  but yea the ones that already have a lot and have to care for them without help on their own want to share the burden and the ones that do n't do much/anything yet do n't want any of the burden , as it is to be expected kinda , everyone just thinks in their own interests, 
  have fun getting 143 $ euros and a room with 4 other dudes , gon na be the wildest time of you life !!!, 
  no not at all , she wants to destribute them so that every country has to take a little and noone has to take too many , otherwise we would ahve situations like in greece or hungrary where people literally ca n't deal with the amount of asylum seekers anymore , but the countries that currently take in very little obviously do n't want to help sooo yea it will probably not pass ... 
  she is n't deciding that , the people come here , most of them get sent back again ( like to the balkans ) , she simply stated that dublin ii is dead because the countries we would send them to could not deal with them , which was ruled by one of our highest court to be against the german constitution ( to send them back ) because they 'd die or be treated inhumanely in countries like greece or italy etc. 
  ( not because of evil people but because the system there collapses ) that is all she said , ohh and that we will keep all syrians , which we would have anyways since syria is a warzone and everyone from there qualifies for asylum if she says it or not ... we will probably take in about 300k this yea , mind you thats not a small number , but way less than 800k and we would have taken them in no matter what merkel said , this was more a publicity thing aswell as condemning the violent neo nazis that have attacked asylum seekers/asylum homes at a rather greater than 1 per day for the first half of the last year , and were just recently attacking police aswell as civilians in heidenau ... good god the stuff people here somehow believe is weirding me out ... 
  if we let them work , they are stealing our jobs , if we do not allow them to work and therefor have to try and make it so that they do n't die they are all just a bunch of parasites ... wtf is wrong with people really, 
  if he was an american citizen that was allowed to permanently stay in germany he could get welfare aswell , also refuggees do n't get nearly that amount of welfare , they get a bit less than hartz iv which is basically what you get if you have not had a job for years and the state does n't want to spend anymore money on you because they have given up on you , so yea :0, 
  meh ignorant idiots , but at the same time they love us :0, 
  i mean it is the csu afterall , there is a reason right wing parties have never been succesfull in one of the most conservative parts of germany !, 
  how did one of their leaders say ? 
  `` right of the csu there shall only be a wall ! '', 
  or something like that lol so yea no surprise here , i wonder when they will introduce the idea of a walk toll for refuggees walking in germany :0, 
  i 'd be okay with decreasing it but i do n't think we even have to decrease it by far , remember i said compared to cost of living . 
  lets take poland as an example , cost of living generally is 60 % of what it is in germany . 
  lets assume what poland would have to give them if germany does n't change anything ( again as you said yourself probably social benefits for asylum seekers in germany would have to be turned down a bit maybe , not sure ) right now someone who is waiting for whether or not he got asylum gets some clothes a place over his head ( usually they hve to share a room with some other dudes , like 5 people in room or something ) and 143 $ per month , so poland would hav to give them clothes a room to stay in that they have to share with others because there is not enough room for everyone and 85,80 $ a month . 
  if someone gets asylum granted they now still get the same roof over their head , they can also ask to get a private home , however it is now allowed to cost more than a hartziv home ( thats homes that the state gives people that did not have jobs for a long time , its really fucking cheap , its 120 square meter for 4 people , for each person less 20 square meter less but someone who lives alone gets the same as a married couple which would be 80 squared meters ) and between 287 $ and 359 $ a month from which they have to pay everything other than housing from now . 
  so what poland would have to do , is pay for adequate small housing , like a 1 room apartment or whatever the equivalent is that the polish poor get ( and if they do n't i guess you would have to look at germany because house priecs are still 40 % lower than in germany meaning you 'd pay less for the same amount of square meters tho i could understand cutting that size down a bit ) aswell as between 172.2 $ and 215.4 $ depending on their circumstances ( like if they are two living together both of them get less on their own while someone living alone gets more towards the higher end of that number ) ohh and 50.4 $ ( from the 84 original german ones ) to the parents that have children 6years or younger . 
  idk how that is comparable to the current numbers in poland but i would think it should n't be that much higher , right ? 
  it comes from how we were raised , and no we were n't raised : look if you do this people will think you are a nazi !, 
  no i was raised in a way different way , lets take nationalism as an exmaple , in school we looked at where it came from , the causes for nationalism what effects it can have ( positive and negative ) , yes at the end we came to the conclusion that nationalism might not be the best idea as it causes violent and irrational behaviour for no real reason , however we were never told its bad because we would be nazis . 
  and i was just never raised by my parents in a nationalistic way or anything , we never had said anything about nazis or how its bad to be german because you are a nazi or whatever , nationalism was just not a thing , why would you be proud simple of where you were born , what you should be proud of are your achievements , the only one to ever mentions nazis at home really ( well other than when i asked when i was young ) was my grandpa who made horrible dark jokes about the hitler jugend and his time in the wehrmacht ( he is pretty leftist himself btw ) that i would laugh at because they were funny . 
  yes in history lesson you get beaten to death knowing every single detail the horrible nazis did but it is never presented as if we were at fault or had to feel guilty or bad or anything really . 
  the first shift towards more leftist `` hippie '' whatever thinking in germany might have been caused by the afterwar period but nowadays its just how we are and its not ww2 that forces us to think like that . 
  also i never said you were saying these things , i was just observing that in general in these threads or in discussions eastern europeans bring up the nazis as reasons for thing or as comparisons waaaaaaaaaaaaay more than germans ( even in discussions just between germans i want to add ) so it seemed weird to me that we are the ones that are supposed to be driven by the events of ww2 when on this subreddit there is a giant group of people that seem to be waaaay more focused about it !,
