  i have only been hit by my parents once ( well on purpose lets say ) and that was on the shoulder and not very hard when i was seriously acting stupid , i find the act of corporal punishment deplorable and barbaric , even worse so if done in schools :0, 
  yea nato is really unpopular over here and i can understand why . 
  first the whole history thing which everyone knows hopefully enough about , and then there is also the fact that to the public it seems the us drags us into a new war/conflict every couple of years and more importantly that the only time article 5 has ever been invoked , it was for , what most people see as , an aggressive war to `` fight terrorism '' , which many people think was just an excuse to use military in order to secure interests just one big giant farce , so people distrust nato as a defensive alliance , tho for a different reason from east european countries who might think not many members will help , the distrust here comes from people thinking that members are too overeager to `` help '' and might try to abuse it to start wars to start conflict to start aggression instead of having it just be there to defend each other . 
  and then what also greatly hurts nato 's image is the guy they send here , breedlove , either he misremembers reports he gets or he really likes hyperbole or he just simply lies to get what he wants ( which seems to be some military action by nato , and my friends would interpret this as a general wanting to try out his toys ) , here is an article about that : http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/germany-concerned-about-aggressive-nato-stance-on-ukraine-a-1022193.html so yea people really really dislike war , people really dislike nato , people think nato wants to go and do wars of aggression and therefor do n't want to support nato ... 
  there also is the fact that noone thinks that there is any real threat of russia ever attacking , so they think that a scenario where a nato country gets attacked is super unlikely , if russia actually tries to attack poland or estonia or whomever , i think public support will rise dramatically and its also not like our government did n't get involved in wars that the german public did n't want before , they do that a lot sooo we 'd probably help anyways ... 
  really ? 
  sorce please since this is kinda news to me , i usually hear bad stereotypes about american tourists and that they tip well =p, 
  i mean , to a state usually its own people are most important so ofcourse to these states us lives matter less than the ones of those countries . 
  it 's the same in the us , no ? 
  or do you really think the lives of iraqi citizens matter as much to the us as the ones of us citizens , heck we do n't even have to go that far , just take germa or french lives , ofcourse they do n't matter as much to the us , the us has to first look after its own interests , atleast thats what americans told me for the last couple years with the spying scandal and stuff , they constantly say : `` the us has to look after its own citizens first and has to benefit them first '' as sort of an excuse , so why would that change when it comes to war ? 
  this is just normal , no need to get so angry about it ... 
  and krass and kindergarten and many others =p, 
  we have honored in the past fighting unpopular wars , and i think we will honor it again !, 
  weirdly enough it seems to be mostly people from the uk stating that the uk is the most hated haha =p, 
  but do they really like you ? 
  i personally think they are just the part of the irish that waits patiently to be finally able to backstab you finishing you off , before becoming independent =p, 
  i 'm tired of beeing called a hitler nazi , oh yea thanks for that austria !!!!!!!!, 
  yes i aggree =p, 
  yes , but we finally have the answer to the je ... ehhh race problem , a final solution as you may say !, 
  that was supposed to be the joke , it was about fox news so i acted as if white people were normal and to create a barack obama ( black person ) you have to suck the white out of them by some evil demonic force =p, 
  ouch ... 
  damn now i 'm really in the mood for a tour de france in a nice german panzer again :0, 
  yes , and i 'm soooo deeply offended d = not really tho , like more than half of those we built ourselfs anyways haha its just that the french have still a positive picture for all the good napoleon did , and like to ignore the bad he did ( like letting his army rape us ... ) , he is one of the nicest dictators out there i guess well in europe atleast , but still i do n't think it is wrong to commemorate a very very important battle for european history !, 
  yes indeed , that was due to the structure of the roman army , which is also what made overthrowing the government so relatively easy just as pompeius showed before =d, 
  if i 'm honest , i prefer di rupo haha , i understand that its necessary for security and stuff , but i find di rupo 's entrance cooler/better than obama ( tho the whole coordination is also nice do n't get me wrong =p ), 
  pshh thats crazy talk , as if anyone ever tried to kill a president lel, 
  something else i noticed about him ... he is ... foreign looking , i ca n't put my fingure on it , but ... lets say you remove almost all the white out of a normal person , then thats obama d =, 
  did n't france make a coin for wwi that my government did n't like ? 
  i mean , i do n't really care tbh , make the coins you want , but if that was the case then this seems weird , but maybe i got it wrong =p, 
  in germany they try to give you the `` wachturm '' paper =p, 
  i 've tried rationally talking to one of them , it felt like talking to a jehovas witness trying to sell me their newspaper ... 
  lol you take one incident and think that now you ca n't even try and check ? 
  as far as i know our banks did this kind of stuff all over the world greek was only one of the bigger places that they did n't check and just bought faulty bonds ( the reason for the bailouts of our banks ) , whats our excuse for all the other bonds , should n't you atleast try to check if an investment is safe ? 
  i mean their cooked books were n't actually that bad , they actually did only exceed the limits by a relatively small amount , tbh we ( germany ) exceeded said limits by a far higher amount in the early 2000s and we did n't get punished or anything ... 
  no they were n't not at all , it was continuing to go down the drain , if you talk about the small rise in gdp that you could see that was because of prices dropping extremely fast and was actually a bad sign rather than a good one , 
  just saying , they are not at all crazy communists , there is a communist party in greece that is far far faaaaar more communist-like compared to them :0, 
  no i do n't think so , i think you can be a good person ( having good intentions and such ) and be religious or whatever . 
  i do n't think religion turns them into retards i think this particular retardedness is part of human nature which is why getting rid of it is sooo hard . 
  sure , what kinda work can you do ? 
  we usually only take ( if its non eu ) , immigrants with university degree or lots of job experience and apprenticeship or something :0, 
  hmm i remember that in 2013 you were 3rd but yea france has n't been growing much lately so i guess you could be second even with rebate =p, 
  holy shit , going to the uk subreddits , it seems like they still really really really do n't like us haha =d, 
  no you are the third biggest after rebate !, 
  yea we blew up lots of shit into awesome fireworks , we brought slavery everywhere , then we kinda stopped doing that and killed people who wanted slavery still and then we started declining by killing ourselfs even more than usually like 100 years ago !, 
  do n't forget us germans , we also stabbed you in the bag =d, 
  actually , it is speculated that by removing the eastern roman empire and having the ottomans have direct contact with europeans is the reason that so many old greek and roman texts were going/copied from the ottoman empire to the europeans ( basically byzanz was in the way of this flowing exchange since they were n't on too friendly matters with the ottomans even wrose than most europeans later , for understandable reasons ) , the reintroduction of old greek and roman texts and this philosphy is also one of the main reasons that renaissance ( and enlightenment ) happened in europe , so overall it was probably a hugely beneficial thing for most of europe !, 
  just wondering , how did you specifically go about getting your master paid for ? 
  i 'm right now playing with the idea of maybe doing my master in the us , thanks , 
  you are wrong on your germany part ( tho only wrong for two years ) since the whole tax stuff has been changed , as far as i know the only real difference is adoption , which is still a big difference tho but i just wanted to clear it up a bit , 
  while not using terrorist attacks , in germany generally offending the christians or football fans gets newspapers/satirical magazines more in trouble , muslims generally do n't react at all , if you do n't believe me , ( which is normal i guess ) just look up the interview done with sonneborg the former chief editor of the german satire magazin titanik !, 
  catholics have tried closing down that particular magazine atleast once by court , they get a lot of death threats and angry people aswell , german muslims meanwhile have n't done such a thing eventhough there have been multiple mohamed carricatures aswell as many `` offensive '' jokes . 
  i do n't know the situation in france , so maybe it is that way ( other than charlie hebdo i mean ) , however here in germany you get in much more trouble offending christians or sports fans ( mostly football , tho i remember national outrage and lots of angry people beeing sparked by some pretty dark joke about michael schuhmacher aswell ) than you get from offending muslims which usually take it pretty well =d, 
  no she defenitely is determined as fuck , determined to stay in power that is , and she will do what it takes to do so !, 
  how could he , he spoke ill of the mutti !, 
  to the austerity pit with him !, 
  i 'm an agnostic atheist , so its also not a matter of faith to me , its just that in germany in general , the protestant church has more progressive stances on things, 
  percentage , but i thought recently more immigrants came to them ( just that it used to be way lower numbers for them ) , which is the important part here !, 
  really ? 
  in germany most are lutheran protestants , who in my experience are more liberal/less backwards than catholics . 
  the official stance of the lutheran protestant church here in germany is that they support more rights for gay people , more equality ( also for women ) and i think maybe even gay marriage !, 
  yea , it feels really weird and shamefull and dirty that we do n't have gay marriage , when i was younger i thought germany was supposed to be one of the most progressive countries in the west , but our little brothers constantly steal that title away :0, 
  mostly , recently some stuff got changed so that they are financially the same aswell , the only big difference i can think of is adopting children , which tbh . 
  is kinda a big deal for people trying to start a family !, 
  so its like 98 % the same , but tbh . 
  i do n't see why we could n't just go 100 % ( i mean for logical reasons i know christian conservatives gon na be conservative and stuff ), 
  just asking because you seem to know your shit , what are the different styles ? 
  you said this was english style , why ? 
  what are some other typical styles ? 
  ( like the german one maybe ? 
  you were however not allowed to marry someone you loved ( which is something you only have limited control of at most ) if they were the same sex , yes people are equal in marrying different sex , however people were not equal in marrying the ones they love !, 
  the only difference i can think of nowadays , is that when you adopt , you adopt alone and then can fill out something after some time so the two of you share it , it also takes longer sooo that defenitely still sucks :(, 
  they now have the same financial rights , there are sadly still differences however , like for adoptation etc. 
  is n't the police down here in bavaria know to be worse ? 
  i always thought that that was atleast the stereotype !, 
  always nice to see that european superiority complex still going strong , 
  i think it is different people , when you see a post about hundreds dead , the xenophobes ca n't come out and clame its a good riddance because they will be downvoted to hell and back , but if it is this topic , many more rational people ( i think ) are staying away because its known for heavy brigades and lots of xenophobes shouting stuff . 
  atleast thats how i hope it is , i do n't want to think that so many people are this hypocritical , 
  yea that kinda seems to be our answer to everything lately xd, 
  if we can for once do a good job with that , then i 'm okay with it , so far most of these help programs for camps have done a pretty bad job at improving anyones situation other than keeping people barely alive , and i 'm not sure people are willing to actually spend enough money to make the life there tolerable ( since those countries themselfs are quite poor and ca n't create all that good situations for refuggees ) ... 
  are n't they taking in waay more people than europe already ? 
  just sending more people into these bairly functioning states and not helping them at all ( monetary if we do n't want to take a few of the refugees in i guess ) , seems really unfair and horrible ... 
  the complete organisation was founded and managed by neo-nazis , in the interviews you could see neo-nazis ( as in more famous one , as in the leader of bavarian npd and some other famous bavarian neo nazis ) , marching there , it is likely that they just got a lot of the guys that usually come for the dresden neo-nazi parades ( which are a thing ) and got them to join in here . 
  they at one point even attacked teens that looked differently who were chilling at a mall , i 'm sorry , yes there should probably be a debate , but pegida was a completely wrotten organisation ... 
  yea , i 'm kinda sad for dresden , i know some people that grew up in dresden or in one of the small villages around it , i feel extremely sad just how bad it got . 
  they are now starting to take over the smaller villages nearby to create a brown culture , here is in article about an example in freital ( in german , sorry ) : http://blog.zeit.de/stoerungsmelder/2015/05/11/neonazis-attackieren-stoerungsmelder-autoren_19345 i hope this will get better some time , but i honestly doubt it :(, 
  beethoven most likely !, 
  however back then the idea of pan-germanism still existed , there was no separate austrian identity , they were part of the german group , so mozart most likely saw himself as a german at the time , 
  no i said , the greeks find ways to not have to pay the loans back ( in your mind , i do n't think so ) , so you should think about it in a positive way , because they are just emulating what we do ( if you actually think they do that ) , and are just doing what we asked them to do , be more like us , 
  it seems that they are learning from us when it comes to not paying back money  we kind of are masters of this , for 70 years now we always found a new different excuse , heartwarming to see the greek people use us as a model of how to do things < 3, 
  we are the legal successor to the nazis ... 
  i mean pegida was pretty much in the vast minority everywhere but in one area ... 
  i admit that there is a more negative sentiment here nowadays , and that people talk more about limiting it , but is not anywhere near pegida , infact the other side ( pro immigration ) got bigger and stronger too , because more people that were relatively neutral had to decide , pegida did n't look all that positive to most germans , so many went more on the pro immigration line than b4 ... 
  so all in all it seems to have become just more divided ... 
  do n't worry , we will send troops to eh ... support the democratic backbone of your country , 
  damn it , one place away from beeing on the list of special cool countries that are smart :(, 
  ahh , so no incentive to actually give your best , do you by chance know how that compares to other oecd countries ? 
  that would have been sick as fuck , i mean , we still would have won , but it would be cooler beating you guys than the place we send our old people with crazy ideas to d =, 
  ohh yea it was extremely important , i just do n't think it was what shaped the current relationship between the countries the most and is what the relationship is build on !, 
  i think he would use the canada treaty with the us rather than other eu treaties , which has outlined that it infact does not help the economy all that much and can lead to a few problems , 
  yea , back in the 50s ( so before you picture ) iran looked even better , during your picture they had a dictator ( thanks us for that ) , the shah , that was really oppressive and lead to a religious lead revolution ( since the left was persecuted but religious leaders were waaay less so , so the only way to organise any movement was through religion ) , btw fun fact the religious zealots did n't fire a single bullet as far as i know during that revolution =p before that in the 50s they had a democratically elected secular president , too bad he wanted to use the oil ( that the brits still said they owned after they left ) to pay for healthcare and stuff , that pissed of the brits and the us and they then managed to start riots till that earlier mentioned shah can get into power with us and british help !,
