  well yea , its weird to me but he seems like one of the lower evils in the republican party , but still is fucking mental . 
  but then again i 'd also never vote for hillary either , because of the campaign finances she gets and her inconsistency its overall just gon na be fucked up in the end i feel : / the tea party kinda fucked the republican party up really badly , with their whole anti-intelligence , super evangelistic , big government ( wars , surveillance , drugs , lots of other restrictions ) but small government ( not gon na take our land not gon na make me pay tax to give to some lowlife ) , pro constitution but anti constitution ( defines the us as a christian state , wants to keep under god , wants to build 10 commandments statues , wants to make school more religious etc. 
  eventhough the constituion clearly states in the first ammendment that that goes against the constitution ) anti gay anti muslim etc. 
  he is , but at the same time he also says sensible things its super weird , he is for single payer healthcare , taxing the rich , getting campaign finances fixed which is all super good the bad thing is that he also for : denying climate change , nullifying the iran deal , bringing back torture against suspected threats to america , banning all muslims from the us , throwing all illegal immigrants out ( which would destroy american agriculture in the south ) and pressuring mexico into building a giant wall on the border , pressuring china to somehow magically give us jobs back to the us and much much more so yea thats too much bad stuff mixed in in my opinion, 
  incorrect : http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/17/politics/sean-spicer-donald-trump-debate/index.html there were about 10 donors out of 1,6 k people, 
   when he said this at the last debate the crowd outright booed him . 
  they did n't actually the first 2 times he said that they did n't boo him there were even a few claps , when he went on to say how bush is a giant failure and made him partially responsible for 9/11 and went on to then again say that iraq was a failure then he got booed , because he went over the top with it and somehow bush is still somewhat liked . 
  add to that , that this was the first time jeb bush showed a spine and stood up for his brother , and the crowd got even more hostile towards him . 
  so if he had just said it once and kept it at that noone would have booed him but trump likes to go into extremes all the time, 
  denying climate change , nullifying the iran deal , bringing back torture against suspected threats to america , banning all muslims from the us , throwing all illegal immigrants out ( which would destroy american agriculture in the south ) and pressuring mexico into building a giant wall on the border , pressuring china to somehow magically give us jobs back to the us and much much more yea no the guy is actually pretty bad, 
  while i think that might be true , i personally do not believe honesty in itself is enough reason to vote for someone , there are plenty of honest racists out there . 
  donald trump has never talked about any detail in any debate he is in , and i have watched every single one of them , and at the same time manages to say so much completely horseshit comments , each and every single one should be a deal breaker , like denying climate change , banning all muslims for an extended period of time , getting rid of the iran deal , bringing back waterboarding and all forms of torture possible against people suspected to be a threat to the us etc. 
  if someone is honestly crazy , thats fine and stuff but oh my god i would n't want him in charge of the most powerfull nation in the world, 
  that climate change is happening is a fact , him beeing proud of beeing `` honest '' about denying it is super fucking stupid . 
  also i 'm not sure he is 100 % honest , i think there are times where he just says the most outrageous thing possible to be in the news , he even alluded to that himself during one debate , he does that because then he will always be the newstopic , in doing so he hopes that he will grab more peoples attention and get more generally frustrated voters on his side , and it seems to be working, 
  while i aggree with him , thats not enough reason to vote for him , if donald trump gets elected we are all fucked, 
  we use wwii for politics ? 
  when, 
  if they think it escalates a situation they are present at , yes , their main purpose is that noone gets hurt so if situation is heated like that they can . 
  but its not like the guy got in big trouble for it, 
  he was arrested for not following police orders not for wearing that hat wtf ... 
  well that was merkels initial proposal , distribute them for short term relieve and then work on a european solution which includes stuff like : more border protection centers in european border countries so people that do n't qualify get spotted early and thrown out centers in countries that are outside of the eu to take in those most in need for help deals with african countries ( pressure through common eu policy maybe even sanctions ) to take their people back beeing a third superpower/big party in syria trying to find a solution getting the refuggee centers in syria working ( currently they ca n't even feed all the people in them which is one of the root causes for the current wave ) pressure/help turkey take more in and make a deal so they can get recognized as a safe country so we do n't need to take any refuggees passing through turkey etc. 
  but noone wanted to do anything soooo this is where we are at now, 
  which is one of merkels proposals and something we are negotiating on , but remember when we started this eastern europe was like `` you want to negotiate with the enemy ? 
  they should take them free of charge its their duty ! '', 
  and all such kinds of bullshit, 
  and then greece gets fucked , huuuraaayyy, 
   the problem is the the german european solution is to take in more refugees by distributing them throughout the eu . 
  to ease shortterm strains wihle striking a deal with turkey to make it recognized as a safe country so that we do n't have to take people passing through turkey , and open up registration sides at the border , to limit the number of people that have no chance of asylum entering the eu aswell as open up centers in non-eu countries so that we take in those that actually need help . 
  aswell as use the power of the eu ( mostly economic ) to pressure north african states to take their refuggees back aswell as use the eu powers to try and make the situation in the camps around syria better ( the camps are currently severly underfunded unable to feed the people in them , which was a big reason the current refuggee wave actually started ) , aswell as try and use our influence to negotiate a solution in syria , as a third party between usa and russia those were all merkels proposals to make it out as if the only thing she said was to take in more and distribute them is completely false and stupid currently germany is working on this stuff alone becaue noone else wants an eu solution because it is n't their problem , which is why i.e. 
  the current solution that was reached between russia and the us was made in munich , and it is why we currently have our ministers flying to all sorts of african states to pressure them , because noone else wants to fucking do anything i 'm sorry but if you want to create order and a manageable situation you have to relief short term stress while u set up capabilities to order stuff and predict future numbers ( the centers at the border of the eu and outside ) in order to plan ahead and thats only really possible with distribution, 
  i 'd say while u are historically correctly , currently germany seems to be the only country actually caring about greece , we are the ones calling for cooperation and have opened in order to help decrease the burden on greece which was going under because of the huge numbers of refugees arriving ( the current wave already started a few months before we stopped deporting them back to greece ) it is eastern europe that currently does n't give a fuck and is willing to sacrifice greece, 
  on what does it lay then ? 
  depending on their age , but i 'd say prison , and make them enroll in programms to finish school from prison , the part that i have the biggest problem wiht is the 2x2m and no winders and the forever part , you put them in prison as punishment and to keep people safe , but at the same time open them a path back into society after they served their sentence , you can also make them do a lot of social work and send them to camps if they are young enough ( not sure how austrian law does this ) additionally, 
  our values are how we act ( aswell as expect other to act ) those are different from rights or whatever . 
  i 'll give you an abstract example if one of your personal values was to always let the person you a conversing with finish their sentence because you feel this is only way to have a good valueable conversation and you treasure this , then no matter who you are talking to you will do it because it is your value it was you believe in , the other person does n't matter for that , at all . 
  so yes our values apply how we behave towards everyone because thats wxactly what european values are , unless ofcourse you want to drop your false act of championing them and claiming to defend them and be honest for a second , that also would be appreciated , 
  thats why you always should take median !, 
  it would cut out the extreme cases !, 
  she fucked up , but if you read the artile , while she fucked up i do n't think its enough for a criminal record ( a suspension maybe ) , the second part ? 
  i disaggree completely , it goes completely against our european values , resocialisation is a big and difficult but worthwhile thing , we ca n't so easily give up on our values just to be reactionary, 
  it is sad that those that shout the loudest about defending `` our values '' are also the first to forget about them when convenient ... 
  i for one like our western/european values , which is exactly why i am against a lot of what the rightwing proposes , because you do not only not give in to pressure from outside to defend your values as a society but maybe even more importantly , pressure from within, 
  in comparison to the jews , it was a much more gradual and slow way, 
  that was the `` good '' part of generalplan ost , let them work as slaves make them unable to get children , let the old starve and slowly take over, 
  not in the same percentage , as a non-jewish pole you were much more likely to survive, 
  but the plan for slavic people was to keep them working and just not allow them to have kids , and slowly resettle it with germans to take over the land that was deemed neccesary for farmland to not let germany starve , because of how fucking stupid german agriculture at the time was and because there were ( i wonder why ) trade embargoes on nazi germany, 
  in germany it is relatively well known i 'd say , the state sadly needed them to function ( well the secret police does n't count , that was just fucked up in my opinion , but stuff like judges and officials with the knowhow were almost all people that had these positions in nazi germany ) , it is also why the left says that the german state is blind on the right eye ( well that and examples of that happenening ) the same thing to an even bigger extent happened in weimar and was one of the reasons that country fell back into rightleaning and later nazi control, 
  they have been tho , i.e. 
  in the inter-war period they were one of the mayor aggressors , they even made a pact with germany to cut up some country between them , or fought of the russians and then cut their allies up with the russians . 
  they just were never big enough to hold their own against the big big boys , but whenever those were looking elsewhere/asleep due to fighting poland stepped up and became a relatively big player, 
  and they got offended over a float ? 
  hahahahaha thats just silly =p, 
   treat people who wrote on facebook `` hey , maybe this whole immigration thing is n't so good '' as potential terrorists when has that ever happened i do n't remember such a story, 
  i have n't discovered any meaning , i was talking about the original , which was in german , which is less ambiguous than the english version because the guardian writers did n't do the best of jobs translating, 
   ` poles killed more jews than germans and in general started ww2 ' . 
  he said poles killed more jews than poles killed germans its super fucking clear if you know any german and are able to understand different cases . 
  while that to me on first glanse still seems wrong , it is a way different subject, 
  not even probably , the german ( thanks to the third case beeing used , the dativ ) is 100 % clear that he means more jews were killed by poles than germans were killed by poles the guardian just fucked up translating because i do n't know, 
  does n't make them wrong either , thats why he is asking , see a good answer would have been : `` because it stands in contrast to almost everything other history professors at well known universities have come too , that makes it way less likely to be true since those people are n't stupid either '' your statement does n't provide any information as to why it should be falls, 
   germans turned into nazis completely understandable , the modern germans have no involvement in any of this so you want a distinction between them , evenso there are enough retards that still think we are all evil nazis hellbend on achieving world domination  german camps turns into polish camps . 
  that one in german is totally fine , but in english i can see how it can cause a lot of error ( tho i do n't know anyone stupid enough to thing those camps where controlled by poles , but maybe i just hang out with the wrong kind of people ), 
  he said it in german , and it is 100 % understandable that `` poles killedmore jews than poles killed germans '' is the intent , only some idiot that does n't know german and translates it incorrectly could spread those bullshit claims . 
  now did poles kill more jews than poles kill germans ? 
  seems super fucking unlikely but still he used the words he wanted , yes and those words are very clear in german , and only an incorrect translation can fuck them up into the words you read somewhere thats the magic of having the dativ unlike english :d, 
  maybe he meant during the occupation ? 
  but thats grasping at straws . 
  there are allegations for about 1500 lynchings of jews by poles without german involvement , and seeing how big the resistance movement was most likely more germans were killed during that time sooo ehh i do n't know what he bases that claim off , does he provide any sources you know off ? 
  we even have this photogrphic evidence that what the man says true !, 
  thank you comrade , ohh poor nazi soldier having to help kill jews for the evil polish empire :(, 
  i live in munich , girls still walk home here . - . 
   collapse no , but slow eroding of the basic public safety and stability yes i mean ... very very very slowly , we still have less crime rate than the safest state of the us , and the difference in crimerate that immigrants/refuggees make is statistically non-relevant according to official sources i have to admit i 'm not an expert on france and the situation there , but this is germany and right now i do n't think we are on a way that would lead to anything like a state of emergency anytime soon, 
  nope , the illegal thing is using the bundeswehr outside of germany in a non-defensive way , which is one of the big reasons why the afghanistan ... uhh thing got a lot of critic !, 
  for a long time it was believed the bundeswehr was only allowed to help in situations of natural disasters etc. 
  however some time ago the verfassungsgericht ( constitutional court ) ruled that using the bundeswehr within german air space with weapons is legal however there are certain restrictions upon it, 
   one could fear for germany too sorry to dissappoint but we are nowhere near that point here in germany :0, 
   turkey has responsibilities they are already taking in more syrians than the entire eu combined, 
  i 'm sorry to say this , but i am not germany i am me , this was just my personal opinion, 
  sadly it seems that its too late for that now : /, 
   german 's style of political debate interesting , what facts to you base that opinion of ? 
  from my own experiences debating politics with germans works decently well , while americans see it as a personal insult the second you disaggree with them , 
  but if you look at the us involvement in the middle east , starting with getting rid of the only secular democratically elected muslim leader there , then i find it hard to see how they have helped the region in any way it seems that everything only ever got worse whenever they decided to cause some bullshit there germany used to be super pro us , but ever since the stupid idiotic invasion of iraq , this has gone down hill and for a good reason, 
  that are heavily underfunded and currently unable to even prevent all its inhabitants from starving ? 
  sounds great, 
  can i use that excuse for my great uncle too ? 
  he never voted for the nazi party but supported them in the late 30s in what they did , can i also instantly cleanse him of any responsibility for his actions for helping the nazis do inhumane shit ? 
  was n't it the fact that funding for the refuggee camps around syria ran out leaving those in a state not able to support even the people that were already there that triggered the mass exodus ? 
   doors were wide open because merkel words were misinterpreted/twisted/inviting them . 
  and she said those words because people asked for a public statement as to why we were n't deporting syrians anymore ( that had been a practice at that point for a few days/weeks ) and we stopped deporting them because greece already , without that open door , was facing a humanitarian crisis as already too many came to take care of, 
  the small minority of poles that helped and supported the nazis ? 
  you ca n't just act as if there was not a small part ( smaller than in most nations ) of society that supported them in a few of their efforts , just pretending everything is fine and nothing ever bad happened is stupid ... 
   they have habit of blaming the polish for some small part , at least , for the holocaust !, 
  really ? 
  can you provide a source , thats mindboggling to me o_o, 
   that 's apparently response to `` polish death camps '' phrase . 
  which is stupid , because since in german the translation of polish death camps makes perfect sense ( it means nazi concentration camps in poland but would be directly translated polish death camps ) since they apparently can enforce this within the eu , are all germans now supposed to get fined ? 
  no the `` real polish responsibility '' is the real amount of responsibility that poles had , in contrast to the `` fake polish responsibility '' which is claiming there was zero support ever , and therefor noone has to ever get punished for helping kill jews etc. 
  noone is saying all poles helped or anything like that , quite in contrast the polish people were among , if not the most supportive of jews and most anti-nazi people that exist , but just like austria its cheap and stupid to just claim noone ever helped ( tho the difference with austria ofcourse is that the anschluss had majority support etc. ), 
  and just shift all responsibility on germany and germans . 
  nations should own up to their past , and to the faults , however little they are,
