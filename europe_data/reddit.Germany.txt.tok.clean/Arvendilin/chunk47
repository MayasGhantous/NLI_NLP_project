  this is the first time merkel has stood for something , she always followed the masses , this is the first time it is different , soo yea , whether or not she is right or wrong in doing so , this is the first issue u can honestly say she is not just pandering !, 
  the `` enemy '' ? 
  oh come the fuck down lol all this wartime rethoric wo n't help anything if we want a good discussion with some real solutions ... 
  justification is searching asylum , you are allowed to cross borders if you seek asylum ... 
  but germany already acted then , i 'm talking about 2012/2013 when it was already obvious that a large number would come but noone did anything , may 2015 was already to late to act , shit was already going down ... 
  i aggree with greece , but i do n't think what much she could do better at the moment the refuggee crisis started , other than one misinterpreted quote !, 
  ofcourse b4 that she could have planned ahead , so we can take them in more easily but its too late now , noone thought about it apparently ... 
  so what do you think , could happen right now that does n't break our constitution or eu or international law that merkel is n't doing ? 
  not really too much , 1 and 20 ca n't be changed , and 1 protects 2-19 from beeing changed too much sooo yea :0, 
  last time voting most countries supported the quota for the 120k , only like 4 countries voted against it , so i think other countries supporting what she wants gives her the right to try and make this an eu thing !, 
  but she just stated the obvious , the right to asylum , part of our constitution does not allow an upper number ... 
  i think we should fit the jews into this equation somehow , for maximum guilt factor !, 
  in germany atleast , the verfassungschutz has found out that they are not succesfully at all , with trying to recruit people from our asylum centers ( they get thrown out , or told to get lost etc. 
  and trust me salafists are trying real hard these days ) , which is kinda understandable since the refuggees come from places destroyed by those same islamists !, 
  so lets hope their successrate with norwegian asylum seekers is as low as their successrate with german ones !, 
  yea , they should have really changed the colour of their skin after living in sweden , ungratefull kids , huh ? 
  then lets try to get less shit/less animalistic , instead of just giving up because `` thats how things work '' ? 
  how is it not , he is using violence to incite fear into people and to coerce them into doing what he wants ( get rid of/stop immigration ) , this is 100 % terrorism , and looking at a few comments , like yours it might be working !, 
  fuck following terrorists tho , they should n't be a concern when we discuss how we deal with this , if we come to the conclusion to stop immigration for whatever reason , fine , but we should n't do it for the terrorists sake , the very idea is sickening to me !, 
  yea those evil immigrants coming here and beeing brown , the poor poor swede could n't help but follow his viking instincts and try to cut the foreigners down !, 
  so what would be stopping them from just speaking german for the hour a immigration worker is around , and then switch back ... and still , i think people have the right to speak however and whatever they want aslong as its in their own home , in public institution , nah , but at home , thats getting waaay to weird for me , the government should n't have the right to tell people what to speak and how to speak it at home unless you try to get someone to murder someone or similiar exceptions, 
  i think banning them from speaking in their own language in private goes a little bit to deep , even thinking about trying to enforce this makes me shudder , but having them speak german at school so they learn it better , is okay i think ... 
  he is saying that a lot of eu citizens that come to germany atleast ( do n't know about austria ) do n't bother to learn german , so they 'd fit right into your category !, 
  atleast i think so :0, 
   this could be tougher if law and justice antagonises germany and other big european powers as it did in 2007 when kaczynski invoked the number of poles killed by the nazis in world war two to justify demands for greater voting power within the eu . 
  what assholes ... 
  what that is absolutely insane o_o and here i was complaining about db prices lol, 
  i do n't care about the : `` do n't spread misinformation you ca n't back up to make the holocaust seem less bad '' law i do however care about the blasphemy law , yes its there so you do n't `` detroy the public peace '' with blasphemy , like trying to go full on attack course against minorities , but minorities are already protected ( as they should be ) under the law , so there is no real reason for that to be there !, 
  what the fuck ... scum ... 
  oh come on , you have n't been killed by nazis for like 70 years !, 
  and even in norway they have them in the car with them they just do n't have them in person , so if they were send to a school massacre they 'd be probably allowed to take them with them i 'd imagine !, 
  neo-nazi apparently : /, 
  not really as turkey can only house and feed 1/5 of them meaning 4/5 ( noones allowed to work obviously ) are not getting shelter or feed , meaning they are actually in some kind of danger of starvation etc. 
  she still has like +50 % support overall , which is more than almost all western leaders i can think of ... 
  calling for a revolution by the rightwing mob ? 
  her poll numbers ( not on this issue specifically or in general ) are still some of the best in the western world , if enough of the government does n't trust her they could kick her out , but i do n't see that happening , and i do n't think anyonre but the fringe right would actually want to try and kick her over this stuff ... 
  still saying thats its a shame the concentration camps are n't up and running right now , at a pegida rally is kinda too over the top ... 
  but the sun does n't really exist , since we are on the hollow inside of the earth !, 
  no its absolutely perfect on the soloists no accent or anything its pretty cool :0, 
  lebanon takes in millions , actually the largest percentage of syrians , that flee the country do n't even get close to europe , the poor countries around them take most of them in , 
  agnostic-atheist , pretty far away i guess =p tho i do n't care about people beeing religious , just do n't bother me and i wont bother you , 
  is n't that the same as all those christians that believe their christian values should be in the laws ? 
  like thats the reason they get all upset over gay marriage and stuff o_o, 
  yup , that way you solve multiple problems with one solution , vegetarians get what they want , people that do n't want to eat daily get what they want , muslims and jews get non-pork stuff ( and its not like its such a big concession , offering halal meat food for every meal would be waaay too much as an example , but having a vegetarian option seems fine , and if they do n't like the vegetarian stuff , well too bad they have atleast and option so its okay ) , so i really do n't like this choice at all , it seems like a stupid political move that wo n't help anyone at all : /, 
  but you 'd still pay for the pork which you would n't eat , that seems kinda stupid : /, 
  i mean , during the pegida parade today , a speaker literally said that its sad that the kz ( concentration camps ) are n't open anymore , and this was n't ironic or anything , i 'm not sure how with slogans like that you could n't atleast see that there are atleast some neo-nazi elements in the group ... 
  yea but thats on the asylum problem , overall she still has way more support , a lot of people that usually sympathise with her see this as her first big fuck-up and still think she has a lot going for her ( i personally would disaggree but whatever ), 
  why not just have an vegetarian option for people that did n't like pork ? 
  it seems so easy o_o, 
  but western europe would need turkey to aggree to beeing recognized as a safe country so we can park the refuggees there instead of having them in the eu , sooooo this kinda does n't help western europe at all o_o, 
  i 'm sorry , you guys are just to brown for this sub to handle !, 
  and you do n't think asylum critics have a motivation to lie ? 
  i 'm sorry but the police here in germany has repdeatly stated how many wrong cases there are , where people just spread bullshit on facebook , the police has to go investigate and it turns out to have been a complete waste of time ... 
  i vote left , but thats more because i 'm not happy with spd , and want to signal that , so that if the left hopefully gets enough votes the spd will move back more towards the left were it used to be b4 schr\u00f6der etc. 
  4 parties in right now you need 5 % and after the last time the fdp fell out after fucking up !, 
  and that 100 % voting yes thing was , so that they show rank and that they are all together for this ( in their opinion ) rather easy vote , so that they can disaggree and infight on stuff like the refuggee crisis , basically voting unanimously yes on this , signals that when they talk shit during the refuggee crisis stuff , they do n't disaggree with the leaders of the party ( merkel ) but with the policy , its like a security thing , and it also singals the voter that they still belong together and that they should keep voting for them . 
  so this is a planned move , 
  but on a lot of issues , like nuclear energy , housing , minimum wage etc. 
  they have moved more and more to the center , historical spd and green issues suddenly became cdu issues because merkel knew it would get her more votes , the rise of the far right aswell as of parties like the afd have also been attributed to the cdu moving more and more to the cneter , i do n't think it is 100 % correct anymore to classify the modern cdu as rightwing , the csu , yes but the cdu is ... weird, 
  oh yea , the greek crisis was a mess aswell , weirdly enough most of this sub was defending merkel back then and going hardcore against greeks and that time i was again against the majority on here i guess xd i just do n't have any luck huh =p i appreciate it aswell , its cool not beeing shouted at for once < 3, 
  huh no ? 
  i was just saying that turkey is not an official safe country so it would break international law to block access of asylum seekers to greece etc. 
  which are the first safe countries on their way ... 
  center-right but more and more center under merkel , rightwing , is more than center right =p, 
  sure i aggree , i do n't like merkel myself but probably for different reasons than you =p the biggest thing for me is that they did n't plan ahead at the beginning , that this was going to happen was forseeable for years but they did n't do anything which is inexcusable . 
  but there is a lot of misinformation going on on this sub , and i just do n't like that so i have to defend merkel sometimes i guess if there is something said that i think is completely wrong , never thought in my life that i 'd have to defend her xd, 
  that is what merkel is trying to do , they passed laws to make it a bit harder to get asylum and make it easier to deport asylum seekers , the try to get turkey recognized as an official safe country is also so we can have them there and then take some of the people from turkey , so that not that many people clog up the system . 
  she did say there wo n't be an upper limit since if they try to change the constitution to do so and it gets struck down ( which it would be probably ) it will be harder to pass anything else about refuggees , so you obviously go down the path of least resistance !, 
  but since she is n't doing the super visible stuff , its easy for morons like seehofer to attack her , but again what he wants to do probably wont work and is just stupid populism : /, 
  no there is a reason why we do n't send people back to the border countries if they are from syria , and it is perfectly reasonable . 
  you see the border countries have to function if we want to have this whole thing go orderly , the border countries have to know who is coming so we can plan ahead and try to get a grip on this mess , italy and greece have been complaining for years that they ca n't shoulder the burden , and that they are close to collapsing under the weight , and if they collapse refuggeees can just simply walk through . 
  so the plan was to take in a lot , have every country share the burden , so that the burden on the border countries gets lowered , so that we get control of those borders back , and then have processing stations there , to not ahve the people unworthy of asylum clog up the system , and then we distribute those ones . 
  sending everyone to greece italy and hungrary is super counter-productive to solving this eu issue on an eu basis , it might help germany in the sort term but will fuck everyone and everything over in the long term ... also actually it might be unconstitutional , it was investigated whether or not sending people back to greece and italy was against the first article of the constitution , as you could n't guarantee a good treatment of those people in these ccountries ( not out of malice but because the authorities and systems there ca n't cope with the numbers anymore , which leads to a situation similiar to turkey where people ca n't get food or housing , meaning they 'd starve or freeze to death which would go completely against the first article of the constitution if we knowingly put people into that fate ), 
  thats what merkel is currently trying to do right now , did n't you pay attention , thats the reason she is trying to get turkey recognized as a safe country , that is the reason she is in negotiations with other states between us and syria ... 
  in what way did the criteria for asylum change since 2005 ? 
  i do n't remember any law passing about that , also currently the merkel administration is passing laws to make it harder to get asylum and make it easier to deport people , so this would not even ahve been an example of something that the right proposed that merkel is n't listening to ... 
  they do , as a german who has read a lot about this , they do ... also what is the problem with the fact that not all are syrian , there are other people from other countries that desserve asylum aswell , right ? 
  there are some that say they are syrian when they are not , sure , but if they have any doubts if you are actually from the country you are from , they have you speak to an official interpreter from that region , and aask you about the local geographie of exactly the place you claim you are from , if you have to big of an accent , fail to understand everything perfectly , or do n't know what the local geographie is like then you are counted as not a syrian ... we also send about half of the asylum seekers back , only accepting half ... 
  so yea , whats your source that we do n't d background checks ? 
  but chapter 1 protects 2-19 from big changes , only small changes , and there is a very big possibility that the court would say that a limit is too big of a change , so technically only 1 and 20 are protected under the eternity clause , however 1 protects 2-19 so they kinda are too !, 
  we do refuggee background checks already , about half of the refuggees get send back ... 
  see , and thats why its soo easy to get upset at merkel , but maybe not actuallly worth it , since she is trying a lot with the boundries she 's given , problem is it is fucking hard , but i personally do n't think that seehofer would do a much better job !, 
  very unlikely , also you ca n't change much since article 2-19 are protected by article 1 , and 1 and 20 are under an eternity clause , the court could argue that an upper limit to asylum would be too big of a change violating article 1 and therefor rule the change of the constitution unconstitutional !, 
  yea i know : / also way to many simply do n't seem to give a fuck , while this was passed , there were thousands protesting , however not against this fucked up stuff but against `` the sexualisation of our children in school '' ... 
  and she still thinks that , we even passed harsher laws so that more people can get deported faster , aswell as merkel trying to make turkey an official safe country meaning we do n't have to take anyone that passed through there . 
  the young girls parents were not qualified for asylum ( anymore ) , thats why they were send back , deported , however as our constitution says , if someone is qualified for asylum we have to take them , we already send half the people back that come here because they are unfit for asylum , and merkel passed laws making this easier and faster ... 
  because our constitution specifically says that we have to take in everyone that qualifies for asylum , thats why we ca n't set an upper limit ( you guys were the ones that put these things in there =p ) , we have to work with what we got , so we should try finding solution , instead of trying to do stuff that wo n't work since it will be shut down ... 
  and after he said he makes mistakes , what does he do differently from her to make the crisis go better ? 
  but she has a plan and laid it out already ? 
  o_o here is what she wants/plans to do : our constitution forbids us from setting an upper limit to asylum seekers , if the border countries ( and border countries are currently considered the first safe countries between germany and syria , meaning someone fleeing from a refuggee camp to greece is actually only in greece in his first safe country ) do n't get a lot of financial help aswell as redistribution ( because there are waaaay too many in there to take care of ) they ca n't secure the border without shutting it almost completely down which with europe as an export continent would be bad for us , if they ca n't shut it down more people will go to germany , it is already looked into if using dublin to send the people back to the border countries is constitutional ( not generally but right now , because of the bad situation like no food and no shelter for these asylum seekers in border countries ) , which all together results in , us having to take refuggees cuz we ca n't send them back , and us not beeing able to set an upper limit because that would be against our constitution ( and you are not allowed to change these first articles of the constitution because of an eternity clause build in ) . 
  so what merkel wants to do are two things , one in germany and one internationally/eu wide . 
  firstly , in germany she wants quicker processing and a quicker asylum process , with more ability to send them back , and more deportation aswell as no help for people that do n't qualify for it , less help for people already here ( which is kinda stupid if you want them to integrate , also the change from giving them money to giving them goods like food etc. 
  makes no sense since this just reverses a previous change which was implemented because actually giving them goods instead of money is more complicated , takes more effort per asylum seeker and is actually more pricey so that would be one fuck up there ) and so on , she is currently implementing laws to do all that , basically making everything go faster and smoother so that there will be less here eventhough we ca n't set a limit . 
  secondly on the eu basis she wants a redistribution system aswell as common eu border protection , and then asylum application centers in the border states , this is there to take burden off of the border states . 
  this in theory should result in a more oderly process , meaning you make it harder for traffickers to profit off of it , and you also know the numbers of people coming to the different countries which enables long-term thinking and planning compared to just a random number of people showing up at your doorstep everyday , and longterm planning is extremely important to solve such a crisis . 
  in theory , the fact that the asylum registraition centers would be at the entry points would mean , that people that do n't qualify for asylum ( currently a bit less then half according to german standards , those people currently either get send back or if they stay here do not since recently thanks to laws that merkel made get any help from the government ) do n't clog up the system , they get sorted out early which makes everything go smoother . 
  internationally she wants to invest more into already existing refuggee camps ( which happens right now , germany is stepping up investing there a lot recently because of her ) so that less people want to leave because of dreadfull condition there . 
  next she wants to establish turkey as an official safe third country , meaning we can send a whole lot of them there , in return turkey gets a lot of money for housing them ( currently they are only able to have 1/5 of them in refuggee camps , the rest is in turkey not allowed to work and not getting any help , meaning they are homeless beggars and therefor understandably want to leave which is something that must be changed if we want to limit the flow from turkey ) , it will be easier for turks to get visas to the eu etc. 
  she is also doing that right now . 
  and she also wants asylum registratoin centers outside of europe , again , so that unelligible people dont get to clog up the system , thos this is one thing i do n't think she is very sure on so she might only make them in europe .
