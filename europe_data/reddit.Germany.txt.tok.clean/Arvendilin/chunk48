  and then she also wants the eu to step up as an international player in order to stop conflicts like syria going on , in order to combat the reason they flee in the first place ( with one of the main reason why they come here beeing the bad situation in refuggee camps which she is also trying to combat ) , she is already doing that , especially together with hollande , the uk as far as i know does n't want to join but rather be its own entity than try to negotiate this stuff as part of the eu . 
  the same for germany btw , she wants germany to take a more international role in these conflicts to stop them , like under her now we send weapons into a warzone for the first time , we did so to arm the peshmerga that were at the time about to be overrun by isis because they were underequipped , these peshmerga were in a very densely populated area , so them beeing overrun would have created a ton more refuggees , thats why she for the first time in brd history send weapons into a warzone , in order to enable the peshmerga to defend themselfs against isis and therefor stop new refuggees from beeing created in that part atleast !, 
  so overall given the limitations of our constitution what she is doing seems to be relatively reasonable , tho as i mentioned above there are some fuckups with it !, 
  how ? 
  she just stated whats the case , having a limit to asylum seekers would be against our constitution , meaning , if merkel implemented a max number she that number would be ruled illegal and gotten rid of by the constitutional court asap , so implementing a max number would be stupid if it gets removed a week later , it would be a waste of time , so what merkel said was absolutely true ... 
  that was mostly because most proposals from the right i have heard are unconstitutional ( like setting an upper limit ) , why would you implement a law as a solution when itll get struck down after 1 weeks by the constitutional court ? 
  depends what you mean with turning this around , since stuff like what seehofer proposed ( having a maximum number ) is against our constitution , soooo a lot of the stuff that these people shout is just illegal and therefor wo n't be allowed to be implemented ... 
  european countries are the first safe countries between germany and turkey , `` securing the border '' ( with which i assume you mean closing them and not letting anyone in anymore ) would be illegal therefor ... you can do all the security against smugglers etc. 
  but the end result you are hoping for , not having to take anyone in , wo n't be achieved unless we break international law ... 
  die linke and greens both voted against it , not a single one of their members voted for it : https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/abstimmungsergebnis-bundestag-e1444991031211.png guess who i 'll be voting for next time , because seriously , eff this !, 
  never said that , but these countries are more nationalistic in comparison , and especially on this sub !, 
  are n't the most nationalistic countries in europe eastern european ? 
  that combined with maybe some extremist americans could be the explanation , since most eastern europeans do n't bother to learn german as far as i know :0, 
  / r/de is what keeps me not going insane , also i kinda like making rightwingers angry and getting insulted by them , when someone who just said that they wanted to shoot all refuggees trying to pass a border pms or replys to you , insulting etc. 
  you , you kinda know you did something right =p i also find it interesting to see , how at the beginning in smaller threads my stuff gets upvoted and after a certain point looses 5-10 votes in like 3 minutes like it just happened here again so yea , its the little things in life !, 
  used to be , but the radicals in the party threw the former leader and everyone that was closer to the center out , and they are currently going further and further to the right becoming basically a second npd , afd in sachsen-anhalt is currently even beeing investigated by the verfassungsschutz because they 've gone absolutely nuts :0, 
  getting austria can be part of it , but it is mostly about taking the half of poland back that used to be german after a bearded idiot gambled it all away and stuff like this , that is just absolutely crazy :0, 
  1 ) premise : anti-refugge people are anti refugge 2 ) right wing extremists use the current mood , they feel embolded they become more active , they hide behind the cover of other people having a similiar stance but not beeing as extreme as they are , they only become so active because more and more people atleast partially support their views 3 ) anti-refugge people do n't town down their rethoric after seeing that extremists use their movement as a cover to hide behind , they do n't take a very clear stance against them conclusion : even after seeing that extremists abuse their position they do n't town it down , therefor are helping and encouraging these kinds of attacks . 
  again , this is your logic , not mine i think you should n't put too much blame on either group , but if you are beeing consistent then thats what this looks like , 
  yea , but i 'm saying is , be consistent one way or the other , if you blame all muslims for terrorist attacks because they do n't go super hardcore against them , you should also blame the far right , you could also only partially blame ( which is what i personally do in all these circumstances ) , meaning there is a bit of a fault here but its not super big , or you could always say its only crazies and the mass is n't at fault ... 
  when they attacked refuggee homes it was mostly b4 people were in there , so they `` only '' destroyed objects and even when they hurt people you could theoretically make the excuse they did n't intend to do so ( eventhough i think that was bollocks ) directly and on purpose attacking and wounding a person is not under any circumstances excuseable ... 
  but they are not immigrating but seeking asylum , for which crossing a border is not a crime, 
  it has begun !, 
  by that logic , this attack aswell as the about 100 murders in the last 20 years that were racially motivated and the xenophobically motivated attacks that happen at a rate of more than once a day are all fault of the right , since they should have known that extrem rightwing nutjobs would only feel encouraged if you aggree even a little bit with them . 
  or we could not follow such a stupid logic :0, 
  i do n't remember leftists telling migrants to commit crimes , meanwhile the rightwing here in germany was spouting bullshit like : `` death sentence for politicians that go against the people/volksverr \u00e4ter '' and similiar crap , which seems to encourage idiots to do this , since , lets not forget , idiots might not be able to understand that this or the gallow etc. 
  were meant as hyperbole but think that their movement generall supports the death of those people !, 
  is n't that one of the arguments , that muslims do n't go harrdcore enough against radicals against isis and therefor might help to foster the growth of these idiots ? 
  the same argument can be made for the right maybe :0, 
  ehh its not complete yet , aslong as we do n't let the vile bullshit of idiots drive us away they will not have completely taken over this sub =p, 
  meaning saving christianity ( jesus the messiah ) from those horrible muslim invaders !, 
  i 'm not sre if he had mental problems , most people that make attacks such as these actually do n't have mental problems ( like they are stpid/crazy but not in an mental illness way ) , he might have just been a very impressionable guy , and with the rethorik on the right going full on attack ( i remember seeing stuff like even asking for death sentence etc. 
  of politicians , and i 'm not talking about that gallow ) , if a person is stupid enoug and listens to this rethorik they might actually think they should act : /, 
  apparently he was a rightwing extremist that was unhappy with the cdu immigration policies , shouting stuff like `` i 'm saving the messiah , society has to be saved from people like this '' and stuff like `` i did it because of reker 's immigration policy '' : http://www.ksta.de/koeln/-reker-bei-messerangriff-schwer-verletzt-sote,15187530,32183418.html fucked up stuff like this is what radicalisation leads to i guess , but it 's still terrible news !, 
  i mean , we still had the northern crusades killing like half of the baltic prussians and shit , there was still a lot of `` convincing '' going on even after the romans adopted christianity for the first time !, 
  my cmmunity hosts a bi-weekly event where the locals and refuggees get together , everyone gets free cake ( the locals and refuggees bring stuff they made at home and everyone shares it ) and free coffee or tea , and then you just talk for hours and hours !, 
  the 've become really good at german now eventhough they had almost not german classes b4 and were n't allowed to take materials for self study with them , which really hindered it all , but this event seems to help them a lot . 
  they loose some of their misconceptions and stuff , and understand how our society works now , their stories are very interesting i have to say , from fleeing out of bombed areas , to stories about civil wars in middle africa its interesting to listen to !, 
  one of them is now finally getting his masters in it at my university which is pretty cool =d so yea so far pretty nice experiences !, 
  they also do n't cause any trouble like ever , i think that stems from knowing the community , we germans love to shame people into behaving well , anyone who has lived in a german town should know that , aswell as with child raising it works that way ( since you really should n't beat your child for discipline you shame it into becoming an orderly person !, 
  ) , however i do n't think it is possible to have the threat of shaming you positively affect your behaviour if you have no connection to the community that is trying to shame you , so them becoming a part of our local community might be why they behave so well , they know a lot of people and a lot of people know them =d we also did n't have any xenophobic attacks on asylum seekers or asylum homes , which i think comes from the fact that locals are able to interact with these people and see how they are only other humans really , they are now a part of my hometowns community !, 
  because , as one neo-nazi from the famous village jamel said in an interview : `` the problem with foreigners is , once you know them you ca n't really hate all of them anymore ! '', 
  semi-public institutions own a lot of them , also you do n't have to be german to be allowed to own them , i.e. 
  in berlin there was a massive surge of rich greek families buying homes ( a lot of which they then let germans rent ) , so yea, 
  yea germans are just naturally worse at making money compared to the glorious brits or french :(, 
  i think we are doing a quite good job of that ourselfs , we do n't need you help thank you !, 
  the uk joins as the sick man of the union and gets taken care off , once its fine and has to pay it sees no reason to stay anymore , got you :p, 
  i live in germany , just get it for free on the internet , thats what i did =p you can download pdfs in all different languages :0, 
  you have n't yet ? 
  let me tell you its boring as fuck . 
  like the guy ca n't write its the most monotone boring bullshit book i have read in my life and as an avid reader that says a lot , also the conspiracy bullshit levels are over the top , and there are sooo many blatant lies , that was the only interesting part for me !, 
  so have fun , read it , but do n't expect too much !, 
  poland would never do that , since germany sends them back if polish citizens do n't get a job fast enough !, 
  and polish people 100 % do n't want to pay for it :0, 
  a lot of kurds but also political dissidents against edrogan and other stuff , like journalists that fear for their lives , 
  no since they are not eu citizens , ofcourse this benefit should only apply to eu citizens ... 
  which safe country are they coming from ? 
  turkey is only one that could be , but it still is not considered a safe country ( and seeing how turkey is only able to house and feed 1/5 of the refuggees they have , aswell as 20 % of turks that apply for asylum her getting their asylum it is kinda understandable why ) , infact there are no officially recognized safe countries between syria and the eu !, 
  with the problem that turkey is not yet recognized as a safe country for refuggees ( merkel is heading eu talks with turkey to change that so that turkey will tkae care of even more refuggees , in return the eu will most likely pay part of the expenses ( since turkey even right now can only take care of 1/5 of their refuggee population ) make visa easier for people from turkey and will probably have asylum centers or something for refuggees in turkey so the eu takes them straight in for turkey and then distributes them !, 
  ) , so you ca n't use article 31 yet , only once turkey is recognized as a safe country we can do that !, 
  i posted the sources in a different comment , this is what i was talking about : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqyphta4wu, 
  http://www.n-tv.de/ticker/dresdner-oberstaatsanwalt-verteidigt-polizei-in-heidenau-article15814116.html this is what happened with rightwing protesters : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoft6uipd6g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltvu8qd4ypc the police just walks towards them to get them to move a bit away in the background you hear selfmade explosives and firework from the rightwing rioters . 
  this is how they reacted to the mostly ( again as i said before , there was a bit of violence going on , bottles beeing thrown but not by many ) peacefull leftwing counterprotest : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqyphta4wu now i 'm not saying the police should n't do anything against the leftwing protesters if they throw bottles , i just think they should react differently to the rightwing protesters , if one side throws some bottles at you and you run them down and beat them up and take them into custody , and the other side throws more bottles aswell as firework etc. 
  at you and you just walk up to them and only get 1 person during 3 days of rightwing riot ( compared to 1 day where leftwingers showed up ) , then that seems a bit weird ... 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i was n't making a general statement i was talking about the specific situation of the protesters in heidenau ... 
  not really as about 70 % still overall think merkel is doing a great job , 33 % think her job with the refuggee crisis is good , so yes that is way lower but you have to remember this is one issue ( a very important one ) but apparently germans think that overall she still does good stuff ( which i disaggree with but whatever ) also you should n't forget that a lot of these people ( i 'd say about 10-20 % of the 66 % which is actually a lot ) are actually more leftwing and want her to do more for refuggees , these people will do everything in their power to not let a government thats more rightwing than merkels spring into existance , iirc , die linke , the greens and weirdly even the fdp have been more pro refuggees than merkel herself !, 
  why not ? 
  it is about europe , not for europe , or do you think we should also ban all americans etc. 
  not really , our intelligence agency already came out saying that apparently salafists have no chance with these refuggees their tries to convert them get either ignored or get an angry reply back , which is tbh . 
  completely understandable if you just flee from a place ruined by that ideology !, 
  it only is able to house 1/5 of its current refuggee population , the rest , not beeing allowed to work ofcourse , gets no food or shelter , which is pretty disastrous there is a lot of conflict between kurds and turks in turkey right now , and one of the biggest group fleeing the war are kurds ( many from syria ) , so that might not go too well either . 
  turkey did n't sign international treaties concerning refuggees , which enables them to do what they want , which means not taking care of them until the conflict is over , this will result in turkey dumping its refuggees on another third country that is n't syria or turkey which is honestly not something you 'd want to happen . 
  application in turkey can take up to 5 years easily , during this time they get no support , food or shelter , which is a huge problem for obvious reasons , if you flee a war you ca n't just stop fleeing for 5 years and then continue once turkey is like `` okay '' a lot of these things can be fixed with more money , and a deal with turkey as a safe country would most likely result in huge monetary transfer from the eu to turkey , so that turkey takes care of the refuggees for us , so a lot of this can be fixed , and i 'm just stating how the situation is right now, 
  why the downvotes ? 
  this should be news this sub loves ? 
  or is it because germany does something they ca n't critizise ? 
  because the us needs them for cheap labour , we right now do n't we 've got eastern europe for that !, 
  we 've gotten actually pretty good at deporting people recently , and merkel passed or is still passing a lot of laws to make it faster and stricter !, 
  there has been a riot b4 , funnily enough the police did n't give a shit about those people throwing fireworks and stones etc. 
  at them ( i think they arrested 1 person in 3 nights or something crazy low as that ) , but as soon as the left showed up , with mostly peacefull counter protest ( there were some stones thrown but way less than the right at the time ) they all got run downed , beaten , sprayed and a lot of them got arrestd ... 
  which is kinda fucked up right ? 
  equal actions should have equal consequences :0 edit : why the downvotes ? 
  everything i said was factual and true o_o, 
  new deportation laws have been passed , they now will be flown out in specially organised group flights , and they have to pay for them on their own by taking a lown from the government , worst case , the government spends a bit of money getting them out ( and aslong as they have n't payed back the loan they are on a blacklist restricted from entering schengen ) , best case , the government spends nothing and they are out , soooo it seems fine !, 
  i asked for a real source , can you find the police statement ? 
  i guess i might have been strained by my family listen to antenne bayern back in the day , i just stayed away from radio since then ; - ;, 
  where did i ever say that ? 
  we are currently accepting 50 % of them , most of the rest leaves on their own a lot get deported , soon more will get deported thanks to the new laws merkel passed ... what are you going on about ? 
  we can feed them , easily , housing is more of a problem but we will manage , but that does n't change the fact that greece italy etc. 
  are currently unable to feed and house all of the refuggees , so it would be unconstitutional to send them back , so if we ca n't house them it would be unconstitutional to force people to come here ( since you would be forcing them to go to a place that ca n't take care of them ) that would be the equivalent of sending them to greece or italy , not closing down every institution or whatever bullshit you just thought up ... 
  if one of them will starve or something similiar what will happen is that the government will have to provide more funds to help them thats it ... and again , you did n't answer my question , form the previous comment ... 
  what ? 
  they have been saying that the whole time ... 
  gender equality aswell as equality of people and our most basic rights are some of the biggest things the left loves , it is not at all nationalistic , to have people in a country live by that countries rule , noone else in a prominent position ( meaning not your pierced 17 year old communist loving schoolgirl ) has ever said anything differently ... 
  sure we are all great and all , but you ca n't just completely forget the entire history of the third reich , and racial purity was if you like it or not one of their favorite subjects , please show evidence to support you claim `` no it was not '' that racial purity was n't one of the core and defining aspects of the nazis ... 
  again , idk about sweden but i just said how it is in germany , if you have a strong accent , or do n't know very specific things about the local geographie of the region of syria you claim to be from , or if you ca n't comprehend syrian texts and stuff , you will not be able to claim to be syrian ... 
  explain what exactly was her fault in any of that ? 
  do you mean taking in syrians etc without an upper limit ? 
  well our constitution literally says we have to , so her not doing that would mean she breaks the constitution which is kinda a no-go around here ... you mean her not sending them back under dublin ?
