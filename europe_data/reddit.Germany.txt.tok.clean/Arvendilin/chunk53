  the us , where people get super fucking defensive about gitmo and other torture programms , or even the shit they did to the native americans , or the shit they did in the middle east , or the genocides they supported because they liked the dictator , like sorry if you think that beeing honest with our past means to you that we hate ourselfs ... 
  seehofer has no chance to secceed merkel , he is just playing his game trying to get more influence for the csu in the union , especially now that one of their election goals had failed ( getting foreigners to pay to use the autobahn ) . 
  if the polls drop too far , or if merkel gets too annoyed by it he will quickly shut up and tone it down ... 
  there is noone high in the union right now that can take over the union ... 
  i know i know , like the raf was hugely against jews etc. 
  but i thought that most if not all of the far left even the most crazy ones distanced themselfs from that :0, 
  in official statistics they are not counted as far right , thats only for neo nazis etc. 
  and for this discussion it does n't matter that islamism is technically a far right ideology , it only matter what they mean when they say far right in the statistics , and they mean neo nazis ... 
  i know it is n't true =p stereotypes generally are n't :0, 
  because the far right is on the rise again , they have been far more confident and aggressive as of recently , they have had the biggest violent rightwing protest in the west since the war in the last year , hogesa , they are growing and becoming more of a threat than they are even right now ( and they are a threat right now , they are the biggest perpetrators of terrorism in germany in the last 20 years , dwarfing the far left or the islamists ! ), 
  i hope they have their chembusters with them to also fight the horrible chemtrails ; - ;, 
  no when we talk about `` right wing crime '' in germany we mean neo nazis , when we talk about `` foreign ideology '' we talk about islamism , you might use these words differently , but thats how they are used in germany however . 
  wait what ? 
  i thought the far left had shed itself from the antisemitism of the past o_o, 
  so you are saying , its their fault bullshit nazis do bullshit things because they exist ? 
  interesting argument i have to say sir !, 
  sure but i think especially the context of the third reich and drawing it on jewish stuff it sends another messages , its more than just normal bullshit vandalism or whatever , do n't you aggree ? 
  it probably was meant that way , since most people do n't ever read past the headline , and i have to admit for like a second i had my doubts aswell considering this sub , but things would have had to sooo drastically change that it still seemed very unlikely  afterall in the last 20 years there have been like 100 germans killed by rightwing terrorism in germany ( according to sz and spiegel i think it was ) , while there were like 2 germans ever killed by the islamic terrorism in germany :0, 
  i mean thats where they are mostly doing it , otherwise it would n't count as a hatecrime against jews i do n't think , lots of synagoges and houses get swastikas drawn unto it :0, 
  hmm i do n't really have that many anymore but i can say a few that are atleast common : all eastern europeans , but most famously poles and romanians , are stealing gypsies that will try to fuck you over , they are also super nationalistic and kinda racist . 
  french people are weird , and pretty gay ( in a bad way , like the super annoying gay friend you have that rubs it into peoples faces ) the english are stuck up , and they live in the past , mourning their long lost empire , too shit to get it back . 
  the swiss are super slow , like suuuuper slow . 
  the austrians are just jealous of us , they want to be german and look up to us . 
  the italians are super chaotic , fuck have you seen how they drive ? 
  greeks aswell as spanish people and kinda all southeners are super lazy thats all i can think off from the top of my head, 
  yes , ofcourse , but did anyone actually not know that ? 
  if you look at trends it seems quite obvious to me , the far right has always been very hostile and they have risen in bravery etc. 
  ( something like hogesa was unimaginable a few years back ) , so ofcourse their attacks would only go up :0, 
  according to statistics most perpetrators are still part of the far right , much more than muslim perpetrators, 
  if you draw swastikas on jewish houses etc. 
  you do that to terrorize them and you seem to have a very clear motive , that does seem to fall under hatecrime ... 
  ofcourse it does , you have a giant rise of the far right , and you have a rise of salafism , those two are giant contributers to anti-semitism : / edit : but remember according to official figures the % of the rightwing in these anti-semetic crimes is by far the biggest , salafists are a problem but compared to the far right , atleast in germany , a relatively minor one !, 
  i 'll try , tho i kinda wan na also go to one of the big ones like stanford haha, 
  why :0 i mean a year is fine , and all cultural exchange n shit is kinda expected of students in germany , but completely studying in the us like my full master or phd , i 'm not sure =p a bit too expensive also the universities are n't any better than mine :0, 
  already beeing deported , read the article please ... 
  what the actual fuck , i ca n't believe that comments asking for the death of him are upvoted on here , i thought we all got rid of our death penalty some time ago ? 
  not really , as spraying foam on a minister literally has nothing to do with any knife organisation :0, 
  are you one of those people that only read the headline ? 
  the attack he did that this article is about was spraying foam from a fire extinguisher on the minister , quick question , what would that have to do with a knife association ? 
  wait why should we lock everyone we do n't accept up in a cell ? 
  will do !, 
  thanks, 
  in germany again , and i usually eat black bread , laugengeb\u00e4ck , or kaiser rolls , when in germany , white bread only after putting it in the toaster and only sometimes =p, 
  the question now is , how good are these bakers ? 
  all american bread i had so far was like super sweet and weird , did n't like it at all :0, 
  but thats only within germany itself , its lokalpatriotism against other germans , however germany internationally does n't have the whole language thing , heck we are the people that switch to english the second we hear an strong accent in a foreigners voice when speaking german !, 
  thats my biggest drawback when thinking about going abroad studying in the us for 1 semester or year , i 'll miss the bakeries soo fucking much :0, 
  yes , so in poland you have twice as many pedestrians killed in road traffic accidents per capita than in germany ( your likelyhood to die in a road traffic accident as a pedestrian in poland is double of what it is in germany ) , is n't twice as much insane when it comes to something like walking accross a street and getting killed ? 
  even a 30 % increase would be a lot o-o, 
  wtf , thats so much more per capita in poland its insane o_o, 
  i love it , i just love checking out idiots and having a quick cheeky laugh b4 getting back to doing other stuff :0 and unlike srs its like actually super stupid stuff and not half of it beeing interpretations on stuff that could be racist if taken out of context ( tho there used to be some gold on srs back in the day , i think , idk the sub bored me quite easily ) , then again i never read the comments on sas i just click on the links =p i just with shit europeans say , since i love laughing about our own idiots most of all !, 
  like that bus driver that said ( in german ) : `` immigrants please get in , all immigrants please get in , next stop auschwitz ! '', 
  and then does the hitler gru\u00df , that was pure comedic gold for me :0, 
  i 'd say you did !, 
  but to be fair other universities are going right after mainz in the quest to achieve the same level of highness !, 
  some faculties are more ahead than others tho , 
  i do n't think its too complicated its about the ending of the word the - chen makes it neutral , any german teacher should honestly be able to tell you that lol and stuff beeing complicated does n't always have to be bad , and its not like german is the only language that has stuff like that , here is a great comment about it : https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/325800/eli5_why_is_the_german_language_so_complicated/cq831iu i.e. 
  english sentence structure can become really weird and complicated and hard to understand for people learning it freshly especially when deailng with the past , there is also a lot of irregular stuff in english , acting as if german was super hard and difficult only because the gender of the word is not the same as the gender of the thing that word describes is kinda weird to me :0, 
  these rankings are always weird , you ca n't really trust the german ranking for a few reasons : firstly , the research output in german university for these rankings is always lower than what the professors output because of the way the university system is set up . 
  this lets them be undervalued comparatively to other international universities that follow the anglo style of things !, 
  secondly german universities are fairly specialised so please never ever use these rankings to decide which one you go to if you are german , as an example , i study physics currently , go have a look at the mathematical theoretical physics master course at the lmu , its absolutely bonkers how high quality that shit it , like even internationally there are masters in theoretical physics that might about at the same level but i have not found anything better anywhere yet , they do n't do experimental physics as well tho , for that i 'd rather go to either the tu munich or tu aachen , there are lots of examples like that !, 
  so those were 2 reasons why german universities might be much much better for you than the ranking indicates , now one why they could be worse : employment after you graduate , if you are planning to get a phd , the system is n't really so nice , german universities do n't offer you much safety in terms of employment compared to the french ones or the british ones from my understanding , this specifically means beeing a scientific worker at the university or one of the big science groups affiliated with them , or if you get your prof. same thing there its not super safe that you 'll find the employment as a professor that you 'd like , there is waaay too much short-term employment going on with not much job security which is one of the big reasons scientists here are leaving the country ( ofcourse talking about different jobs its different , like as a physicist its statistically very unlikely that you will be jobless , but you 'll just do something in the industry maybe something that does n't even have anything to do with physics ! ), 
  so yea , please do n't use these rankings to decide , ever look at the universities themselfs , what they offer etc. 
  ask people that studied there etc. 
  actually it happened once before like this , when the refuggees from the balkans came , this was a counter-movement against a rising amount of neo-nazis . 
  today is basically the same , many people see and hear the neo nazi attacks or most shockingly recently maybe the neo nazis protests in heidenau , so they want to show that they do not support neo nazis and that neo nazis do not speak for the silent majority or something like that :0 so it only has n't happened in recent times b4 now , because the neo nazis were n't as publicly active !, 
  this one is pretty ridiculous trashy and , if you remember that heidenau was the place with the recent violent nazi protests really funny how they sing about accepting and beeing open and how everyone is welcome to share their ideas etc. 
  you just ca n't stop us germans trying to invest in eastern europe , 
  sweden and finland do for sure , i 'm not 100 % on denmark , i just assumed all danes are like the swedes n stuff :0 hehehehe, 
  i mean ... you kinda are :0 now get anschlussed again < 3, 
  sure so sweden is kinda the same as you guys ( well higher development , education etc. 
  all i knew of hungrary before ( current not historical one ofcourse ) , was that you introduced anti-semite/nazi stuff in your schools , and that only thanks to a german comedian/politician : http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?ref=i093355&amp;videolang=en&amp;starttime=2510&amp;devurl=http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player/config.cfm ( with subtitles ), 
  but would n't a fine ( paying for the privilige to keep them unused for 6 months + ) work kinda the same as your taxes ? 
  both forces them to pay money if they want to do that thing that is deemed to be not beneficcial to overall society :0, 
  i 'm sorry , i 'll go make fucked up horror stories for little children with my nordic friends again ; - ;, 
  they made them vote , only 4 countries voted against it , you 'd probably like to know that poland also voted in favour of this stuff = 3, 
  so communism did a lot of horrible bad shit , that does n't mean you should reject anything that even reminds you of communism , we do n't have to only do extremes . 
  closest would be austria probably we do a lot of things together , but they are basically germans so they do n't really count !, 
  most important if probably france , they are one of the pillars of the eu and french-german relationship has become a very important one indeed !, 
  after that the us !, 
  if you want to talk about in the last 70 years instead of currently , i would take the us as number 1 most important , since france for some reason did n't like us all that much for a long time :(, 
  that was soooo fucking long ago , currently austria and germany are super close allies !, 
  ofcourse we would !, 
  we took them in from the balkans aswell , eventhough our neonazis were going apeshit about it in the 80s and 90s , we would do the same for poland !, 
  so basically west germany 's role during the cold war ? 
  does n't sound too nice of a role to me tbh :(, 
  i do n't think that we would be too slow to react , we already have jets intercepting russian ones in parts of eastern europe , the job that the uk used to do but does n't do much anymore since like a year ago . 
  if russia actually went crazy i think germany would be among the first countries to heavily react  it is just that to a lot of current crises demand much slower and more methodical action ( although i would aggree that we fucked up majorly with our response time to greece , but i also do n't like the way we responded at all either : / ) , you could see a few weeks ago what happens if things are rushed , it all started with a ministry internal guideline ( to not send syrians back to border countries , as those countries ca n't take them anymore and we can try ease stuff until a common eu policy can be found ) beeing leaked to the press , the press going crazy on it , merkel trying to quickly ( for her ) respond to it , and then a small part of a long statement beeing taken out of context/misinterpreted by international press and all hell breaks loose :0 but if something like a military invasion was happening , you bet we would respond quicker than that !, 
  i actually think we would do soemthing , we are n't acting a lot right now because it just seems absolutely crazy for russia to go this much further , however to make it clear that we will actually act , nowadays a lot of eastern european airspace is guarded by the german luftwaffe instead of the british raf like it used to be !, 
  uhmm ... its actually most of the eu 's choice , but okay, 
  but thats normal , if they want to buy stuff for a big project , like lets say a new autobahn , then they first try to pay for all the properties , then the ones that do n't want to buy it , get the ability to negoatiate an even higher price , then a higher and higher one etc. 
  now if there is vital part of land that someone does n't want to sell ( and again is vital like there is no way in planning the autobahn around it without having to go crazy weird ways with it ) , then they can force you to sell it ( at the normal price not one of the super high ones you were offered ) , because its needed for the common good or whatever you want to call it . 
  do n't act like this is a new weird refuggee thing ... 
  well sure but the law is not only about asylume seekers , iirc . 
  in berlin a law such as this was needed because rich families were swooping up all the apartments and leaving half of them unoccupied to drive up the price of the rest to insanity levels . 
  all this says is , if you have an apartment and not use it yourself for anything at all or not even rent it out , then you will have to pay a fine !, 
  i honestly do n't think that is something that completely horrible or bad tbh . 
  my old town used to be t\u00f6ging am inn like a little shitty thing , right now i 'm living in munich but moving to innsbruck soon for university , 
  quite a few of them do , and their english is top notch anyways , and with only one german lesson a week and no materials to take home ( generally , thankfully we had a giant community effort here to get it to 2 lessons a week and them getting stuff to learn at home ) if they do n't interact with germans it will only take longer !, 
  we are doing it here , with a bi-weekly event where they and the locals can talk over some tea and cake , and just chat and talk about stuff , in english , broken german or fluent german depending on how long they 've been here basically , it seems to help improve everything a lot really ,
