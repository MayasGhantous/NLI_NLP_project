against . 
  germany fighting russia again would inevitably lead to ww3 and to the end of civilization as we know it . 
  i have great doubts that these sanctions are actually working as intended . 
  the russian elite , the millionaires , billionaires and politicians will have access to all the same luxuries as before . 
  the common people will suffer under it but state controlled media will tell them to blame europe for it . 
  the people will get even more patriotic because of this and question their own goeverment even less . 
  just take a look at north korea or cuba . 
  both countries are heavily sanctioned for half a century and while the common people suffer immensly under it their goverments are going strong . 
  east germany was the richest of all communist countries by far . 
  could you drive anywhere in the uk nowadays without getting scanned ? 
  i did n't want to offend you . 
  you literally said  the uk has these scanners everywhere if this is true , and i have no reason to not believe you , the surveillance of traffic seems to be `` complete '' to me . 
  i picked that up and wanted to add my thoughts to it . 
  there are obvious advantages of total surveillance but society has to pay a huge price for it . 
  to catch this one person they would need to violate the rights of all other 82 million germans as well as all foreigners driving on the autobahn and in the end this would n't have saved a single life . 
  the names of the accused are not kept secret , they are just not allowed to get published in the media . 
  you could go to the public trial , as a journalist or as a normal citizen , and there you could find out because the accused gets named openly in the court room . 
  you are right , as always , 
  the maximum sentence in germany is 15 years so 10 years is quite a lot in that comparison . 
  the names never get published no matter what crime or conviction . 
   how come his `` dumb foreigner '' bit sounds more like a `` those dumb germans '' bit ? 
  i did not get this impression at all . 
  he tries to entertain a few million americans with his story , of course he has to exaggerate a bit . 
  it 's show business , not a personal vendetta against germany . 
  most foreigners using german roads do n't do it for holiday purposes .

  he never got the authority to negotiate and hitler ordered his execution as soon as he heard of himmler 's attempts . 
   berliner schnauze is not something positive i agree for the most part . 
  there are the rare exceptions when it 's actually charming and funny but most of the time it 's just plain rudeness and it pisses me off . 
  true , but they are nasty and rude to everyone . 
  most germans are immigrants in berlin themself . 
  this city is the most welcoming melting pot of germany , maybe even of europe . 
  i 'm living in berlin for 5 years now and i have never witnessed any racism by employees of public transportation and i 'm using busses and trains on a daily basis . 
  in fact , i have n't witnessed any racism at all since i live here . 
  i rarely visit the former east though , experiences are probably different there . 
  you can buy it a lot cheaper in germany actually . 
  [ best price in the past ] ( http://www.supermarktcheck.de/product/4430-pilsner-urquell-tschechisches-pilsner/preise/ ) was 11 euro for a case of 20 bottles which comes down to 55 cent a bottle . 
  the german version of this article says about three times as much . 
   and what colleagues from germany think about this ? 
  no pudding for jews , of course , 
  another report : [ where people are the most and least tolerant of homosexuality ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2013/08/lgbt-tolerance-map2.jpg ) .

   `` what 's big , black , noisy , makes a lot of smoke and cuts carrots in five ? 
  the romanian machine for cutting carrots in four . '', 
  that 's fucking hilarious . 
  tackling the really important issues i see .

  at the moment we are just paying more for electricity while hoping the people in charge of the energiewende are doing a good job in the long run . 
  if and how it really works out we will see in 15-20 years . 
   germany should never aspire to a permanent seat on the united nations security council because it can never project force to enforce the decisions of the security council this is an interesting point that i never thought of before . 
   it can never project force to enforce the decisions of the security council because of its genocidal past . 
  we ca n't project military force because of our grundgesetz ( constitution ) that was written shortly after the second world war and was highly influenced by germany 's genocidal actions . 
  the general consensus was that the german military `` should never again become a serious threat '' and the constitution was written accordingly . 
  this means our military is only allowed to act to defend the country or our nato allies , and it is only allowed to act on nato territory . 
  as a direct result our army has the proper equipment it needs to defend against an attack in close proximity but it does n't have equipment to attack countries half way around the globe . 
   first , that answer was sarcastic . 
  ( when i said the us had nothing to do with the fall of the soviet union ) that 's where my apology partially came from . 
  ( i notice sometimes on / r/europe [ 1 ] people do n't pick up on my sarcasm and think i 'm gulp serious ) sarcasm is always difficult to get when written and maybe me being german makes it even more difficult . 
   the us - in essence - kicked the russians out of eastern germany . 
  done , however , not in the style of ww2 , but through the `` cold war '' . 
  the soviet union was spending an ` enourmous ' amount of its gdp on competing with the us , and that plus many other factors led directly to its downfall and countries like eastern germany and bulgaria and the rest of the soviet bloc dissolving and the russians ` going home ' . 
  the us did a lot for western europe and germany in particular . 
  you were the major force that kept the soviets at bay in 1945 and prevented them from occupying all of germany and maybe even all of europe . 
  you made [ this amazing thing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_blockade#the_start_of_the_berlin_airlift ) possible which kept the soviets out of western berlin . 
  i would also agree with your argument that the us was outcompeting the soviets economically which played a huge part in the collapse of their system . 
  what i disagree with is that the us `` kicked the russians out of eastern germany '' . 
  in my opinion this was the result of the unprecedented peaceful revolution that happened in the gdr at that time . 
  i asked a pretty straight forward question :  `` are you trying to say the us kicked out the russians from eastern germany ? '', 
  instead of answering it you fake apologized and claimed the exact opposite :  i 'm sorry , the us had nothing to do with the collapse of the soviet union in my personal experience discussions that start like this are a waste of time . 
  you did n't step over any bounds and do n't have to apologize . 
  this is just my personal opinion . 
  i did not say anything like that and after reading your reply i regret to have entered this discussion because nothing will ever come out of it . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  the us `` kicked out the russians '' from eastern germany ? 
  great decision . 
  you go denmark !, 
  in some bundesl\u00e4ndern it does n't cost anything to leave the church . 
  berlin for example . 
  we are all secretly planning our third attempt to take over the world . 
  italy will not be allowed to join this time , though . 
  and the merchant gets paid by the customer . 
  no offense taken , 
  it 's basically the same in germany . 
  queuing = survival of the fittest . 
   media in lockstep with the government this is the most scary part of it . 
  and remarkably the free press did this on their own . 
  shameless plug : / r/europics, 
   i got yelled at by a woman here in berlin the things i have seen . 
  old people yelling at each other on an empty road because one of them was walking while the light was red . 
  just amazing , 
  interesting and true point . 
  this strictly obeying of traffic rules has two sides of course . 
  for example on the autobahn if i can trust other drivers to follow the rules strictly it gives me the freedom to floor it on the left lane without the fear of causing a horrific accident . 
  not crossing a red light on an empty road at night is ridiculous of course . 
  punctuality is the one thing where i consider myself 100 % stereotypically german . 
  if i have an appointement at 10 o'clock i will arrive 10 minutes early , smoke a cigarette in close proximity and press the door bell between 9:57 and exactly 10 o'clock . 
  also if someone else lets me wait for more than 10 minutes i consider it a personal insult . 
  understood . 
  thanks for your support .
