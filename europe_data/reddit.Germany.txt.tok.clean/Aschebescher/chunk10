  there is no conspiracy here and no need for a public thread , especially since it takes much longer until we get aware of the problem this way . 
  i honestly doubt that 's true . 
  why is this downvoted ? 
  is n't the telegraph a reliable source ? 
   the post title is literally the first sentance of the article you are right , i missed that completly . 
  i removed it . 
  the headline was heavily editoralized which is a reason for removal anyways . 
  and would there be no downsides ? 
  can you explain how that would be good for nyc ? 
  i had a currywurst in berlin yesterday for $ 1,40 and it was of good quality . 
  low priced food is one of the main reasons i enjoy living here . 
  if he only used the single word , not framed in a sentence , it is indeed very rude . 
  maybe you are right . 
  on the other hand both of these threads are about sports , a rather unimportant topic in the grand sheme of things where people always take the opportunity to shittalk . 
  even if it 's a game between two cities in the same country you would see similar comments . 
  it would be more serious if this happened in political threads . 
  by the way , nowhere did this submission get so many upvotes as in [ the canadian subreddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1yultn/how_each_country_lists_the_olympics_medal/ ) but nobody seems to accuse them of hating america . 
  i know how hard it can be to not take these things personally by the way . 
  if you were on reddit yesterday you have probably seen the picture of the german chancellor on the frontpage with a hitler moustache . 
  that post had thousands of upvotes and there were at least 50 `` do n't mention the war ! '', 
  comments in the comment section . 
  of course every single one of these 50 comments was proof of the individual 's superiour sense of humor , you know , that thing germans do n't have , lulz !, 
  i would lie if i said things like this do n't piss me off for at least a few seconds but then i try to focus on how intelligent and rational people look at that post . 
  those people would n't make a connection from the nazi chancellor to me personally just because i 'm german , it would n't even occur to them that i had anything to do with that . 
  in that moment it becomes really easy to browse this clusterfuck of a nazi-circlejerk and i do n't even feel the need to downvote a single comment . 
  this is basically the same situation like in this thread here . 
  people are laughing at that shitty picture , not at you as a person . 
  if you can hold that thought in your mind the hard feelings are gone . 
   many people on here seem to think its some giant propaganda conspiracy all i see is a bunch of redditors having a laugh at a fucking olympic medal table . 
  none of the europeans and none of the americans here in this thread had any say in how this thing was displayed . 
  it 's not an attack on you personally , your character or your honor and it 's not an attack on any other american here on reddit . 
  it 's just having a laugh at an incident nobody here had any influence in . 
  it 's okay to have a laugh at it as well or if you think it 's stupid and unfunny it 's okay to not laugh at it . 
  just please stop acting like a victim because you are n't one . 
  come on , why ca n't we have some lighthearted fun ? 
  if there is nothing wrong with the way the us portrays the medal table then there is also no reason to be so insecure about it . 
  i know . 
  i was witness [ of this remarkable display of collective butthurtness ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1yxnr5/how_each_country_lists_the_olympics_medal/ ) yesterday . 
  prepare for the `` anti-us circlejerk '' brigade ... 
  you win the wars , we win the olympics . 
  that 's the rules i just made up . 
  and the world cups of course , all three of them . 
  `` creative accounting '' . 
  that germany is the most spied on country in europe has nothing to do with our economy , they are only spying on our politicians and business leaders to keep them safe from al qaida . 
  they could be tasty . 
  the guardian : [ former president yulia tymoshenko released from prison as president yanukovych disappears and police leave the streets of kiev ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-crisis-uncertainty-after-yanukovych-signs-deal-live-updates ), 
   why are you assuming that the economy will be well run and organised ? 
  i 'm not assuming it , i 'm hoping it .

  i agree . 
  i just think that people who look for a europe subreddit and subscribe to it tend to have a more positive view of europe , and those with a more postive view of europe tend to be more pro eu . 
  that 's just my theory , i could be wrong of course .

  by caring about your neighbours you are caring for your own people as well . 
  europe is so densly populated , if a country 's economy or social system goes down the shitter it * will * affect many other countries . 
  that 's why helping countries like greece is not completly altruistic , it 's in our own best interest . 
  or bribe the guy who rejected his art school application . 
  no problem . 
   denmark , norway , sweden , finland and iceland are all relatively healthy social democratic welfare states . 
  i like that . 
  the same goes for germany , the netherlands , austria and probably a few more countries . 
  with greater integration you could help influence the other countries to follow this path as well .

  it 's no coincidence that subsribers of / r/europe tend to have a more positive view on europe and the eu , it 's in the nature of reddit 's subreddit system . 
  people who subscribe to / r/soccer tend to have a positive opinion of soccer , people who subscribe to / r/liberal tend to have a positive opinion of liberalism and people who subscribe to / r/conservative tend to have a positive opinion of conservatism . 
  / r/europe is no exception to that pattern .
