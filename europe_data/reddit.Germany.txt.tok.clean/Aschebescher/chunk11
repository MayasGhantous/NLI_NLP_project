   likewise when it comes to prostitution there is one party which tells the other what to do , one party which experiences more risk , one party which is freer than the other in declining the transaction . 
  i guess you want to imply that it 's always the customer who makes the rules , always the prostitute who experiences more risk and the customer who is freer in declining the transaction . 
  if that 's the case then you are making a very broad generalization that is just not true . 
  that 's all totally subjective . 
  a drug seller could be in economic duress as well and i would argue that a prostitute who earns 100 euros for half an hour benefits from the transaction as well . 
  if that 's true then i know such a country now . 
  interestingly it 's still the opposite of the swedish prostitution law , where the seller is the victim and not committing any crimes . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you but you are talking about countries where certain drugs are ( semi ) legal and about posession . 
  i was talking about buying and selling of illegal drugs . 
   another common example is that of selling and buying drugs : the buyer is a victim , whose health is compromised by the ( often addictive ) substance , and the seller is the criminal who , through trafficking , puts such harmful things in circulation . 
  i do n't know a single country where it is handled like this . 
  if the drugs are n't legal both the buyer and seller get punished for the deal . 
  the swedish law implies that women are always victims . 
  it implies they only prostitute themself out of desperation and ca n't be held responsible for that decision . 
  i think that 's discriminating against women as well . 
  they get treated like children under the age of 14 who ca n't be punished by the law for their actions .

   the feminist alice schwarzer has led a campaign for germany to reverse course on its prostitution laws and copy the approach in sweden , where it is illegal to buy sexual services but not to sell them . 
  this means a man caught with a prostitute faces a heavy fine or prosecution , but the woman does not . 
  the swedish approach is the worst of them all . 
  if two people `` conspire to commit a crime '' you ca n't only punish one of them , that 's blatant discrimination . 
  either that or you are implying that women are victims by nature who ca n't be held responsible for their own actions . 
  it got caught by automoderator , i approved it manually now . 
  why do n't you post it here instead ? 
  this thread works very well so far . 
  all relevant updates are in one place and there are many active discussions .

  it 's about `` ukraine 's political struggles '' and is closely related to the topic . 
  i think the sticky thread is the right location for it right now .

  last time we made a new thread every 48 hours . 
  only at the end when everything was calming down did we have have one that stayed up a bit longer . 
  if the updates are coming in as frequently as today a new thread every 24-48 hours seems reasonable to me .

  if you take a look at the frontpage right now 12 of the first 12 postings are about one single topic . 
  if everyone uses the megathread as it is intended there should be no reason for the discussions to stop . 
  - so apparently him speaking german made it even worse . 
  seems like they forgot something ... 
  a friendly reminder of [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_please__don.27t ) : please do n't :  be ( intentionally ) rude at all . 
  by choosing not to be rude , you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us . 
  denmark : [ in china they eat dogs ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180748/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) . 
  my absolute favorite , if you have n't seen it yet you should really consider it . 
  romantic comedy : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0960790/ action thriller : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167132/ great comedy : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416331/ okayish horror thriller : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187696/, 
  best german stoner comedy : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258760/, 
  very fast paced thriller with happy end : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827/, 
  this one is a great crime/comedy movie : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0135790/ almost impossible not to like it . 
  you mean not depressing movies , right ? 
  they are n't , only the ones based on the two historic events that kinda were dark and depressing . 
  no movie can accurately describe a whole country , at least not over a longer time period . 
  i just tried to be funny with my comment but apparently nobody bothered to click on the link . 
  [ das boot ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zudtaczkgrs ) , obviously . 
  they knew , but up until recently it was unofficial . 
  removed because of editoralized headline . 
  the only people publishing and talking about it are those who pretend to be outraged , this is really interesting to observe . 
  the best example is [ the article in the daily mail ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2551470/schumacher-fans-sickened-german-satire-magazines-cover-picture-comparing-f1-hero-disfigured-austrian-f1-legend-nicky-lauda.html ) . 
  first they print it huge and in detail , tell everyone how outraged they are , then you can watch the result in form of an angry mob in the comment section . 
  normally they rage at germans because we do n't have any sense of humor ( and because we are nazis ) . 
  today they rage at germans because * we have * a sense of humor but in a situation that is ** absolutely no laughing matter !, 
  ** quote :  it is sad that they find that funny . 
  the poor man is in a coma and they think that is funny . 
  what horrid people they are . 
  quote :  the good old german sense of humour again !, 
  well lack of !, 
  it is truly weird what they think is funny . 
  one of their own too . 
  how disgusting . 
  and of course this is reason enough to end freedom of the press :  any magazine that is willing to publish this foul rubbish should be closed down . 
  and a last one :  the germans never did understand the difference between humour or humanity compassion is not in their vocabulary . 
  just amazing how well the outrage machine works ,
