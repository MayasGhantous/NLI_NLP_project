  makes sense , thank you . 
  this is awesome . 
  where did you find this ? 
  also , there are three times as many women in / r/gonewild than men ? 
  that 's the last thing i expected . 
  seems like i had the wrong translation memorized for it . 
  i thought `` ethnicity '' was referring to genetic lineage exclusively . 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  these people probably confused ethnicity with culture , at least i hope so .

  this is absolutely valid in my opinion . 
  the only ones making a joke out of this are the courts that , of course , wo n't convict the chancellor of anything .

  of course . 
  there are lots and lots of traditional songs that far predate 1945 but i think it 's mainly the old or very old generation who are into it . 
  thanks for the ohrwurm .

  if you let the lyrics sink in it 's basically about fucking , like all of heino 's songs . 
  they are all unintentionally racist , intentionally sexist and it 's always about fucking , sometimes even about rape what is still considered normal intercourse in heino 's world . 
  shameless plug : / r/europics, 
  the results have n't been posted yet . 
  i know you are all looking forward to it and so are we but there are no doubts that the mod working on it has valid reasons for the delay . 
  i 'm sure the release will happen in the very near fututre and hope you can endure the anticipation until then .
