  how exactly is a mega thread stickied at the top of the subreddit taking away attention ? 
  they even spelled their brand name with an '' \u00df '' . 
  i guess the ss would have been majorly butthurt if they had published it .

   dear / r/europe / community , the moderators have censored this comment of mine in this thread . 
  this is not true . 
  your comment got automatically removed by reddit for reasons unknown to us and a moderator of / r/europe approved it manually . 
  not yet , but soon . 
  this seems to be a map by a german artists and nils holgersson is very popular among german children . 
  is that real or photoshopped ? 
  i disagree . 
  welfare should always provide for those in need regardless of why they are in need for several reasons . 
  if you start to deny heroin addicts welfare because they made `` a concious decision to perform an act that could make them unfit for work '' you have to do the same for people who have a dangerous hobby like downhill skiing . 
  these people make `` a concious decision to perform an act that could make them unfit for work '' as well and still nobody wants to deny them help when they had a bad accident and ca n't work for several months . 
  another reason is that society does n't benefit by denying heroin addicts welfare . 
  these people do n't cease to exist just because they do n't get food stamps or money from the state , infact they will probably cause higher cost that someone else would have to pay . 
   if you give people the right to pump potentially addictive substances into their body , it is n't very fair to also provide a safety net . 
  what ? 
  why not ? 
  these two things are totally unrelated in my opinion . 
   the people of / r/europe [ 1 ] seem quite offended at that idea and i 'm not sure why . 
  i can only speak for myself and assure you that i am not offended by any opinion . 
  in think britain joining would be in the best interest of the eu ** and ** in the best interest of britain so of course i hope they join . 
  if they decide otherwise i might be disappointet but certainly not offended . 
  come on , all we are doing here is giving our personal opinions . 
  i 'm pretty sure the goverments will make their own decisions without giving a fuck what we wrote in this thread . 
  i 'm sure downvoting all dissenting opinions will prevent britain from joining . 
  keep up the fight , you can make a difference . 
  no , they will do what is in their best interest , and that is joining . 
   every country only gets one film . 
  i did not know this . 
  the headline says `` top rated films on imdb '' and to me that implied that the map is supposed to show all movies on the imdb toplist . 
  das boot and der untergang are somehow missing . 
  both are on the imdb toplist on place 71 and 116 . 
  by the way , there is a european subreddit dedicated to pictures now called / r/europics for those who are interested and did n't know about it yet . 
   like many families who decide to educate their children at home , the romeikes and the wunderlichs are evangelical christians . 
  this is with very , very few exceptions the only reason people want to homeschool their kids . 
  it 's about withholding certain knowledge , plain and simple . 
  for every other reason there is a simple solution . 
  your kid is in pain ? 
  send it to the doctor . 
  you are unsatisfied with the teachers ? 
  complain to the principal or send your kids to a different school . 
  you want to teach your kids lots and lots of religious bullshit ? 
  do it in the afternoons , school ends very early anyways in germany . 
  withholding knowledge is a form of mental abuse , if you want to raise your kid to be an idiot in certain areas the state has to step in and ensure the child has a fair chance in life . 
  some weeks ago i saw a disturbing video on youtube with a homeschooled girl that was at least 13 years old and could n't do simple math . 
  i tried to find the video to link it here but with no luck , maybe someone else knows where to find it ? 
  the are big in south america . 
  it is definitely a form of nationalism but one that has n't been tried before and one that could be seen as progress if exececuted wisely . 
  it 's both and there is no reason for that to ever change . 
   the key part is in the last sentence - whether we are happy for tunisia or morocco to join , using the same criteria for judgement as with serbia or ukraine . 
  i think treating everybody the same would be absolutely essential and the core of building trust in the system . 
  there has to be a clear message , if you are willing to meet the criteria you are welcome . 
  this could be a great motivation for countries who are still struggling to make some serious progress on their own without any threats or pressure from the outside . 
  the eu should n't expand aggressively from the inside out but by providing such desirable living conditions that other countries want to get in . 
  it works like this already . 
  a country that wants to join has to agree on certain key values like human rights if it wants to join . 
  if these criteria are met they are welcome to join . 
  it should n't even matter if the country that wants to join is directly at the border of the eu or on the other side of the planet . 
  there is absolutely no guarantee for it to succeed but it 's so worth a try . 
  the important point is that nobody has to give up his identity . 
  there only needs to be an agreement on a few key values for it to work like how to deal with violence , crime and people in need and so on for it to work . 
  the united states is a perfect example for this . 
  50 different states , everyone has his own identity , own food , own cultural background , even some unique laws . 
  it works because there are a few federal laws all 50 states have agreed to follow . 
  there is absolutely no reason for this to not succeed on a bigger and bigger scale as long as peace and prosperity can be ensured for everyone . 
  it 's basically a form of tribalism to end all tribalism . 
  we try to enlarge the `` circle of trust '' by including more and more people with whom we can agree on important key values to ensure peace , safety and ( hopefully ) prosperity . 
  in a perfect world this would go on until the point when everyone is accepted into the tribe and at that point nationalism would cease to exist . 
  yes , but it 's true . 
  i never heard of any portuguese stereotypes here in germany . 
  looks like there is [ a perfect candidate for me to vote for ] ( http://i.imgur.com/grpndz1.png ) . 
  please do n't use url shorteners in the future , it 's a security risk for the users and the comments get stuck in the spam filter . 
  there is also / r/europics . 
  i 'm honestly afraid of the news after waking up tomorrow , he does n't deserve to go this way . 
  i would argue a war against terrorism is winnable , just not with violence . 
  better education , better living conditions , empowering of women and less religious fanaticism and we are on a good way . 
   unskilled labor comes with minimum pay and rightly so . 
  that sounds like you want these people to be punished for something .

   two world wars and one world cup ... for you guys and three world cups for us . 
  we all know football is serious business and far more important than anything else . 
  ergo , we win .
