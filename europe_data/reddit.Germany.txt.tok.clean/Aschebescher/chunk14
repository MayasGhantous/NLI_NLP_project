  if there is one people who will protest this shit * some day * it will be the french . 
  and i hope we have the guts and brains to follow their example . 
  spotify is awesome , i use it almost every day . 
  i do n't get paid to say this . 
  do you have a flag ? 
  all she is interested in is staying in power , she could n't care less about pornography.l, 
  the civilians look so casual and unconcerned . 
  because some of the numbers are public . 
  the nsa has a budget of [ $ 10.8 billion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_security_agency ) while the german bnd has a budget of [ $ 460 million ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesnachrichtendienst ) just to name one example . 
  we have less funding for espionage so statistically the risk is lower . 
  very candid of you , apology accepted of course !, 
  your comment got removed by automoderator for reasons that are unclear to me . 
  i have approved it now . 
  what he says . 
  the whole premisse of this submission is bullshit . 
  what 's wrong with trying to find out the truth ? 
  who says germany is the richest country ? 
  what about norway ? 
  nevermind then . 
  would you mind posting your pics to / r/europics as well ? 
  i think they will be really appreciated there . 
  i would pirate that movie . 
  everyone involved should be held responsible . 
  the worst is when they are referring to `` american lifes '' . 
  this or that could cost `` american lifes '' . 
  this rhetoric gives me the goosebumps and makes me very pessimistic for our future . 
  please resubmit with the correct headline . 
  if it gets stuck in the spam filter one of the mods will approve it . 
   kiselev says in sweden , there has been a `` sharp rise in child abortions , early sex is the norm - from the age of nine , and it is not surprising that child impotence starts at 12 . 
  there you have european values in all their glory . '', 
  this is very worrisome . 
  because what sub-saharan africa really needs right now is a fucking aircraft carrier . 
  wow , this changes the perception of the gif entirely . 
  not sure if serious ... 
  many redditors seem to think if they only downvote a submission hard enough it wo n't come true . 
  you are right and some day people will understand . 
  i 'm 125kg with 40 % body fat , of course i look tasty . 
  with over 80 million people you have some crazies once in a while . 
  [ daaamn !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf9cs-ixa9a ), 
  til dutch humor is even worse than german humor . 
   which song should they play ? 
  it must be a new song , otherwise they are n't allowed to participate . 
  not sure what you mean with official language but i would love to see rammstein at eurovision . 
  it would be awesome and hilarious at the same time . 
  [ innsbruck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/innsbruck ) and [ schladming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schladming ) . 
  both for hiking and wintersports , and of course the food . 
  seriously , go to austria for the food . 
  nice try , vladimir . 
   protesting is simply a small nuisance for politicians . 
  it changes nothing . 
  protesting is the ** only ** way to change anything that matters . 
  at least as long as enough people are going on the streets . 
  that 's not my impression at all . 
  in my experience brits can laugh about themself , it 's the americans who get incredibly butthurt if they get criticized by foreigners . 
  if you are too fat for a life boat you probably wo n't fit in the life jacket that you get in the plane . 
  you are probably right that they did n't do it for liability reasons , i still think with 230kg it should be allowed to travel by a cruise ship . 
  they claim not be hateful over there but they fail far too often for my taste . 
   mr chenais tried to get passage on the queen mary 2 cruise ship but was also refused due to safety concerns . 
  how can one be too big for a fucking cruise ship ? 
  because being embarrassed about your sexuality is for the greater good of society . 
  like always , there is already a subreddit for that : / r/ilivein, 
  i have a hard time believing that there is a real threat . 
  maybe some extreme leftists throwing paint bombs , if anything . 
  so isses . 
  shameless plug : / r/europics, 
  i was just parroting a [ joke by dylan moran ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ioliu2ni66w#t=101 ) . 
  of course i got it wrong and nobody found it funny . 
  german is a horrible language , nobody should be forced to speak it . 
  my knowledge of history starts only around wwi , i have no idea what happened between prussia and austria . 
  not sure , can we ? 
  has there ever been a serious dispute between austria and germany in the past ? 
  i doubt it but i 'm no historian . 
   lake constance ( austria , germany , switzerland ) there is no actual dispute or conflict , but there is n't a defined border . 
  how boring . 
  agreed . 
   rest is correct . 
  no , it 's not . 
  the guy who was killed was walking the red light . 
  the driver got acquitted by an official german court because the victim clearly was at fault . 
  the victim 's family does n't accept this , though , and demands to be paid by the innocent guy . 
  i 've been to more than 100 metal shows in germany and the netherlands and have never seen anything like that . 
  iceland . 
  because without total surveillance western europe would become like somalia . 
  you heard it here first . 
  today i watched a report on the secret service guys who had to explain themselfs to the parliament in the uk . 
  they basically said total surveillance is neccessary because terrorists are threatening our way of life . 
  in reality terrorists ca n't threaten our way of life . 
  they may be able to kill 10 or maybe 100 people . 
  this would be a great tragedy but in no way a threat to freedom and our way of life . 
  what is a threat to our way of life is total surveillance . 
  if we let these people continue to do what they are planning then we are heading into dark times . 
  would n't just the next one of the `` stronger '' countries take germany 's place ? 
  like france or the uk ? 
  how would germany leaving the eu be beneficial for the rest of the countries ? 
  i 'm honestly curious . 
  they also have problems cooling the reactors on very hot summer days . 
  on these days they are importing as well . 
  interesting . 
  they are indeed a net exporter , [ except to germany ] ( http://www.renewablesinternational.net/france-net-power-exporter-except-to-germany/150/537/59937/ ) .
