  i know , but what for ? 
  very interesting , i just do n't understand why france is producing this insane amount of electicity . 
  is it because of their heating ? 
  they are , at least the informed ones . 
  also the verfassungsschutz is pissing many people off . 
  it 's all fine then i guess . 
  carry on , citizens . 
  they forgot [ the one in nuremberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christkindlesmarkt,_nuremberg ) , arguably the best one of them all . 
  if this was authorized by volkswagen it was a stupid fucking idea . 
  this map is bad . 
  no way the british press is as free as the american one for example , but they have the same colour . 
  who cares what people are `` supposed '' to have ? 
  who is in charge of the `` supposing '' ? 
  yes , her . 
   is berlin building out any major construction ? 
  yes , and berlin is basically bankrupt . 
  i do n't think `` clown '' is the right description for her . 
   the most dominant country ( regarding users and also with the biggest population ) , downvotes what it does n't agree with . 
  the german userbase is not `` dominant '' on reddit . 
  not by a long shot . 
  i 'm living in berlin and have the right to vote in this but i have no idea what to vote for . 
  thoughts ? 
  there is also / r/germanmovies , the oldest `` full movie '' subreddit of them all . 
  even more than japan , that 's impressive and unexpected . 
  i think the biggest contract t-mobile offers in germany is 5 gigabyte . 
  hoping the same and it 's looking good so far . 
  no data limit on your mobile phone ? 
  i did n't know something like this even exists . 
  thumbnails are enabled . 
   the reason we do n't give a shit and back it too is because we 're not affected by the nsa you are a funny man . 
   germany and france are the us ' poodles just as much as the uk is . 
  not really . 
  germany and france are the old europe now , at least according to donald rumsfeld . 
  done . 
  your internal citizenship : sweden, 
  one can learn a lot about human prejudice just by reading [ the old thread now ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1opnfx/4yearold_girl_possibly_abducted_from_a_european/ ) . 
  you can [ read it here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1opnfx/4yearold_girl_possibly_abducted_from_a_european/ ) . 
   the sun soon might go up at 8 and go down at 14 i would get depressed in no time . 
   the baku oil fields were coveted and almost ( briefly ? ), 
  reached by the nazis in wwii . 
  if they had reached them , who knows how the rest of the war would have gone . 
  the war was unwinnable either way . 
  leaving the eu because of this seems a bit of an overreaction , do n't you think ? 
  how do you spot an extrovert finn ? 
  when talking to you , he stares at your feet instead of his own, 
  youtube link : [ the death of yugoslavia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oodjsdlosyo ), 
  israel wants to join the eu ? 
  they found 20 billions euro in cash and do n't know whom it belongs to ? 
  damn , how often did you guys get liberated in the last 1000 years ? 
  that 's the most american question i ever saw in / r/europe . 
  not speaking german in germany is not exactly assimilation . 
   constant overhearing of germans trash talk about portuguese i 'm living here all my life and i do n't know a single person with prejudice against the portuguese let alone trash talking about them constantly . 
  where did you make that experience ? 
  500 people on a 20-metre boat is madness but the people on it probably thought they had no other choice . 
  i would n't be surprised if they had paid the traffickers beforehand and did n't expect the travel being suicidal . 
  it 's complicated . 
  how fast does it go on the highway ? 
  he would get impeached . 
  never read youtube comments if you want to stay sane . 
  why does the fp\u00d6 have more than 20 % ? 
  how is that even possible ? 
  you do n't have a finacial crisis like greece or like germany in the late 1920s , right ? 
  not that this would make it right , but i just do n't get it . 
   yes kampusch suffered a lot in her life . 
  i still ca n't stand her as a person from all i gathered about her . 
  i think that 's really weird . 
  lots of people seem to have that attitude , but i just do n't get it . 
  she was a small child when she got abducted . 
  adolf amadeus beethoven , the piano fascist . 
  i like the food and the accent . 
  the far-right populists are disturbingly popular . 
   what about stuff like stds ? 
  there are several solutions to this problem . 
  for example in germany prostitutes must go to the doctor every other week in order to be allowed to work . 
  i 'm sure the have a similar solution in las vegas . 
  there is also protection like condoms . 
  in any way the risk of getting a disease is not a reason for the goverment to ban anything . 
  the nazis were against anything and anyone that did n't conform . 
  they hated homosexuals , foreigners , alcoholics , the unemployed , people with the wrong haircut and people with the wrong clothes . 
  they loved worshipping the flag , singing the national anthem on every occasion , they worshipped soldiers and uniforms . 
  they were `` tough on crime '' and big fans of traditional `` family values '' . 
  if this is n't a right wingers wet dream i do n't know what is . 
  i do n't agree with the staying out of personal lives part . 
  right wingers love it to lock people up for victimless crimes like smoking marijuana and prostitution . 
  they always pretend to be for small goverment but it 's a lie . 
  they want as much control about people 's lifes as others . 
  who came up with the idea that right wingers do n't want a big goverment ? 
  just because they are claiming it all the time does n't make it true . 
  right wingers want to have as much control over the people as almost any other political denomination . 
  oh , i did not know this . 
  they invented pilsner beer . 
  i 'm thanking them every day for that . 
  this is the wrong subreddit for your post . 
  try it in / r/self or / r/needadvice for example . 
  [ peter schilling - major tom ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koidjvamave ), 
  best reason so far . 
  i do n't find that funny . 
  at least you are trying to provide interesting content . 
  i 'm curious , is 99 your year of birth ? 
   we do n't have any treaties with anyone .
