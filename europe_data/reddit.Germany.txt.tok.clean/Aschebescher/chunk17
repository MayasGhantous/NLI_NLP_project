  both countries are very safe . 
  switzerland is more expensive but they earn more as well and have the nicer alpine scenery . 
  there are , but mostly for his cheesy music . 
  i have n't made anything from it . 
  california got populated by europeans only recently so it does n't refute my point . 
  with japan you could be right but i personally do n't know enough about it . 
  i think this is one of the main reasons europe is so well developed and prosperous . 
  once something is built it lasts , at least as long as there are no human made disasters .

  french respect the germans , but do not love them . '', 
  i think he was responding to your question :  do we cherish ** internet surveillance ** and mc donald 's ? 
   poverty is caused by white flight sorry , but that 's bullshit . 
  it 's an oversimplification of a complex problem . 
  poverty and inequality for example ? 
  it would be considered insulting to call a human being with the neutral gender article , though . 
   drugs distribution mafias are organized and always violent . 
  extremly violent . 
  spain police being lenient with these networks could lead to spain ending up like mexico violence wise . 
  no thanks . 
  would n't legalisation lead to the exact opposite results ? 
  if history taught us anything the german army would have to help them . 
   we should use the next most widely used language which is german . 
  yes , that would go well with the british .

  you guys just could n't resist to make it sound cute i guess . 
  why not ? 
  please do n't use link shorteners in the future because comments containing them get caught in the spamfilter . 
  the video of the piano version is so fucking creepy .

  my favorite song right now is a 20 years old song from mot\u00f6rhead . 
  i listen to it several times a day . 
  [ mot\u00f6rhead - i am the sword ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7bdkelejfq ), 
  go for it . 
   if you have 100 foreigners that ask to see that handbag and  but i would n't go as far as calling it racist i 'm sure you realise it yourself . 
  they also only sell products with high turnover , almost no popular brands ( haribo is one of the rare exceptions ) and do n't put much effort in presenting their products . 
  customer service is non existent and you get treated like an annoyance . 
  it helped schr\u00f6der win the elections , that 's why he made the decison . 
  if merkel would have been chancellor back then we would have marched into iraq alongside the americans , i 'm sure . 
  come on ... 
  cars , beer , dog breeds ( why did nobody mention this yet ? ), 
  and on a more serious note the way we dealt with our past . 
  but we have that , too .

  that 's sarah brandner in case you want to google her for research purposes .

  why does this have so many downvotes ? 
  999 out of 1000 actions we take are completly unnoticed and people have no idea how much time we spend to run the community as smooth as possible .

   getting rid of downvotes in comments that 's impossible , you are overestimating the amount of power and influence we have . 
   whoever can make the call on this and banned him , mods of r/europe , please provide a proper reason , or revoke the ban .

  german shows and movies start at 20:15 because of a very popular news broadcast that runs from 20:00 -20:15 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tagesschau_ ( germany ), 
  germany abandons nuclear power for energy generation but not for research . 
  there are still german companies like siemens building nuclear plants elswhere in the world and there will still be research . 
  maybe it will hurt as in the next 10 years but after the transition is complete ? 
  no way . 
  rudi carrell . 
  this will change next to nothing . 
  the problem is n't a lack of daycare , the problem is low pay and a lack of job security .

  i really hope you are trolling because this is the dumbest shit i have read in a long , long time . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i only ever heard of a limit if you want to carry cash money across a border , never heard of a transaction limit . 
  one of the most dependable laws there is . 
  just go a random rammstein video on youtube for example , the probability that people discuss nazism and hitler is almost 100 % . 
  no , that 's not the case . 
  you need to know where to look for it . 
  i 'm living in berlin for almost 5 years now and i have never seen people having sex in public .
