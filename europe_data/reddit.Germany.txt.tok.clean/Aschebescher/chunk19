  at least in my head it is but i have no idea if this is based on reality . 
  voting is a basic human right in a democracy and should n't be taken away for any reason . 
   that was a self-deprecating joke . 
  i know and i was n't serious either . 
  this was the only fitting gif i knew of . 
  i ca n't explain it , just looks better . 
  also i have the dutch pronounciation in my head whenever i see it . 
  that was predictable . 
  in german it 's `` lecker '' . 
  the dutch spelling is far superior . 
  a secret spying program going public is not the definition of doing something well . 
  you know which country has the best intelligence service ? 
  have you ever heard of them ? 
  me too . 
  i like to use it every opportunity i get which is not very often . 
  my biggest fear is that this whole ordeal drives the common people apart . 
  you can already see it in many comment threads on reddit , even in this one , how people take a `` patriotic '' stand because they feel personally attacked when the actions of their goverment get criticized . 
  now with lekker smaak . 
  exactly . 
  kind of an army , just that they bring help and disaster relieve instead of guns . 
   response to natural disasters i voted for that , too . 
  how awesome would it be if we had an international `` natural disaster response force '' in europe ? 
  like hospital ships and planes , teams with trained dogs for areas that got hit by an earthquake and so on . 
  they could be everywhere on the globe in 24-48 hours and help the people in emergencies . 
   no hands across america had a self-driving car traverse america from coast to coast ... 18 years ago . 
  i 'm sure it 's a lot easier to drive with an automatic car on a highway than in a crowded city as the article says . 
  i still doubt germany is leading , though . 
  there are lots of promisiong projects , not only in germany . 
  damn , that 's even better than my nomination . 
  the mysteries of international diplomacy . 
  that 's a real problem and i do n't know how to fix this either . 
  please do n't use link shorteners in the future because comments where you use them get automatically caught in the spam filter . 
  i have no idea . 
  we are splitting hairs now . 
  fact is germany , the state , did n't produce it . 
  first , 200 is still more than nobody which is what you claimed . 
  secondly , the us did n't help poland at all . 
  your country got occupied by russia and the us did n't give a shit . 
  and last , the 200 soldiers were n't needed to help for the invasion , they were just a tool by george w. bush to divide europe . 
  [ this train wreck of awkwardness ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qje3cdm7f1c ), 
  it was commissioned by zdf . 
  the producer is a private company called `` teamworx productions '' . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation_war ), 
  i apologize for not quoting you right and i will correct myself :  never ever in modern history any group of poles did anything wrong becouse of their nationality poland sent 2,500 troops to help the us invade iraq . 
  this was an unprovoked invasion based on lies . 
  [ here is the source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multi-national_force_%e2%80%93_iraq ) . 
  are you still of the opinion poles did never ever anything wrong ? 
  there must be an english version somewhere because it will get broadcasted in the us soon but i did not find it yet . 
   never ever in modern history any group of poles did anything wrong i hope you are trolling . 
  but what would be the alternative ? 
  everything else takes up even more space , excpect for public transporation maybe . 
   produced by germany germany does n't produce tv series . 
  the producer is a private person . 
   germans are presented as joyful and sensitive people i started to watch the series because of this thread and just finished the first 90 minutes episode . 
  things that happened so far : german soldiers executing pows ( committing war crimes ) , german soldiers executing civilians , german soldiers executing children , german soldiers forcing civilians to walk into a mine field . 
   germans are presented as joyful and sensitive people have you even watched it ? 
  honest question . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1gujlu/goebbels_propaganda_is_still_alive_over_60/ ), 
  any german speakers who want to make up their own minds you can download the series [ here ] ( http://de.ddl.me/unsere-muetter-unsere-vaeter-deutsch-stream-download_1_20735.html ) . 
  it is three parts and each goes 90 miuntes . 
  i watched the first 90 minutes just now and these are the things that happened so far : german soldiers executing pows ( committing war crimes ) , german soldiers executing civilians , german soldiers executing children , german soldiers forcing civilians to walk into a mine field , a german officer repeatedly forcing a woman to have sex with him . 
  how one can get the impression this is some `` goebbels propaganda '' to show the germans are `` good guy gregs '' as someone said in the other thread is beyond me . 
  have the people who make the accusations even watched it ? 
  i will watch part 2 and 3 later and expand my comment after that . 
  thanks for your reply . 
  this series seems to produce a lot of negative emotions . 
  the german media is reporting that there is a big public debate in the polish media about it . 
  i am downloading the series right now to see for myself . 
  i found it online , if any german speakers want to make up their own minds you can download it [ here ] ( http://de.ddl.me/unsere-muetter-unsere-vaeter-deutsch-stream-download_1_20735.html ) . 
  i do n't speak polish and can only understand parts of the last two links which are both citing the same source . 
  maybe there are germans who used that term but i have personally never heard someone saying that myself . 
  it seems to me that these are more a description of the geographic location , which is true . 
  these camps are located in poland . 
  this does n't mean they were build and run by poles . 
  the whole world knows which country is responsible for the holocaust , people who think the poles did it have to be mentally retarded . 
  never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity . 
  i am very interested in news from the outside , that 's one of the major reasons i go to reddit . 
  what does `` leave europe to us europeans '' even mean ? 
  does he know this website is hosted in the us ? 
  why does he address fox news as `` america '' ? 
  so many questions . 
  it 's impossible to have a nation made up of 100 % scumbag steves or 100 % good guy gregs , as you like to name it . 
  i will watch this movie as soon as possible , if i can find it somewhere online i will watch it today , make up my own mind and report back . 
  linking it to goebbels style propaganda seems very hyperbolic to me and is probably a form of misinformation itself . 
  i have n't watched it yet but i will do now just because i want to know the truth . 
  who upvotes such an ignorant comment ? 
  i have never heard the term `` polish concentration camps '' said by a german . 
  the education about the holocaust in germany is extensive and does n't sugarcoat anything . 
  and it certainly does n't blame the poles . 
  edit : the only explanation i have for this is that english speaking tourists are using this term when visiting the camps in poland . 
  again , i have never heard a german person say this in my whole life . 
  why is it hypocritical ? 
  the education question bothers me a bit . 
  i do n't have a college degree but i completed two different apprenticeships in the german system . 
  this were basically 6 years of specialized schooling but if i answer the education question correctly i fall into the bracket of `` high school or less '' . 
  edit : also the drug question . 
  what if one uses more than one kind of recreational drugs ? 
  amazing . 
  how can educated business journalists even come up with an idea like that ? 
  the swiss have subtitles in their news broadcats .
