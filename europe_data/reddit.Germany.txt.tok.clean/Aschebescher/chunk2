  it means a lot . 
  most people here are neither hard working nor efficient . 
  also the stereotype of german pedestrians not crossing the road when the traffic light shows red ? 
  i 'm risking my life on a daily basis to fight it . 
  why not ? 
  is n't almost everyone customer of aldi and lidl , not only lower class people ? 
  i 'm am a strong independent black woman who do n't need no veil . 
  indeed . 
  that 's why not accepting credit cards at all is the only reliable way to reduce cost and that 's why it 's such a widespread custom for german supermarkets . 
  people here are willing to do without almost anything if it saves a few cents in the end . 
   i 'm not the one paying of course you are . 
  the percentage that goes to the credit card company is already included in the product prices . 
  aldi and lidl alone make up half of all german supermarkets and they do n't accept creditcards . 
  never in my whole life have i witnessed racism targeted at a veiled woman . 
  if anything these women are seen as victims of a supressive religion , not as a threat . 
  it 's really woth it to invest a few extra euros when buying vodka . 
  if his assumptions are bullshit what do you call yours ? 
  honor killings and `` familientrag\u00f6dien '' are two different things , though . 
  a family tragedy is almost always some kind of murder suicide where one person snaps . 
  an honor killing is supported by ( at least parts ) of the community . 
  without a community there would be no honor to defend . 
  i think you owe your mom a bar of chocolate tomorrow . 
  most people are too afraid of change and uncertainties for this to end up with anything else but a `` no '' . 
  germany is enslaving africa ? 
  care to elaborate ? 
  this is a very good question and the right answer to it is `` yes '' ( in my opinion ) . 
  to stand by the side of the us and not get in legal trouble our politicians made some serious mental gymnastics and declared it an act of defense , though . 
  we got a new constitution after wwii that clearly says our armed forces are not allowed to operate outside of nato borders . 
  if merkel ordered the bundeswehr to drop bombs in the middle east she would get in big trouble . 
  who would have thought that we get blamed for * not * enganging in military operations outside of our borders some day ? 
  no far-right groups in the us . 
  of course not . 
   i ca n't name a single thing . 
  that does n't surprise anyone . 
   i think germany 's military is strong and very capable which is why i do n't agree with basing forces in your country . 
  it makes no sense . 
  us forces are stationed in germany mainly for logistical reasons , not for protection . 
  with this in mind it actually makes some sense . 
  you should listen to this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va9in-98vpe, 
  a `` total war '' in this time and age would end in a nuclear holocaust . 
  i do n't think there is anything to prepare for that . 
   i had almost forgotten about us winning that thing .

  oh you . 
  a nazi reference . 
  how clever and unexpected . 
  what a hyperbolic and ignorant generalization . 
  i do n't agree with merkel 's politics and i never voted for her . 
  these kind of comments getting upvotes feels pretty alienating . 
  what irony ? 
  i 'm a strong independend black woman and i do n't join anything my friend . 
  who , if not a german , is aware about this at all times and feels responsible for pointing it out openly ? 
  that might be your wish but it 's certainly not the truth . 
  whatever you are trying to do here you are not very good at it . 
  what else is it good for ? 
  dehumanizing is the first step to prepare for atrocities . 
   but you are also german . 
  hmm , not sure what you want to imply here . 
  the stereotype that says we do n't have a sense of humor is true in my case but only in the sense that i myself am not witty or funny . 
  the sense of humor that makes me appreciate other people being funny is fully developed , though . 
   while i usually find european comedians funnier than americans , for me it 's the exact other way around . 
  almost all of the really great comics are from the us imho and stanhope is one of them .

   then why do germans act like they gave greece truck loads of cash for the `` bailout '' when none of that `` bailout '' money never left germany and went straight to german banks ? 
  i do n't . 
  she should have picked a better word for it that does n't have any connection to wwii imho but at least it is based on the same principle ( giving money for reconstruction after war ) . 
  luckily the destruction from the war in ukraine is n't even a fraction of that after wwii and the amount of money needed to rebuild is analogous . 
  500 million for reconstruction and additional 25 million for refugee housing .

  what about that royal who wanted to collaborate with the nazis ? 
  yes , that 's exactly what i meant . 
  sometimes . 
  [ you are forgiven ] ( http://i.imgur.com/km4rgqj.gif ) , son . 
  i 'm surprised luxembourg even has a second city . 
  right , a single recorded phone call that was n't even targeted on purpose and total surveillance are basically the same thing . 
  it evens out . 
  germany/germans have no right to complain anymore . 
  everyone spies on everyone else , it 's normal and we should get used to it . 
  lol !, 
  / r/worldnews has 6.2 million subscribers and less than 10 active mods . 
  impossible to provide consistent moderation that way . 
  i 'm a hessian . 
  born and raised . 
   i 'd say after a century or two here , you 're a real european . 
  only 63 more years for me to become a real european then . 
  i 'm really looking forward to it . 
   i 'm english and have been to the us - a lot of the stuff is the same . 
  that 's because of globalization . 
  you can buy the big american brands in every western supermarket not just in england . 
  i doubt you can buy many english products in the us . 
   the working hours , opening times , religion there is no mandatory minimum amount of paid time off for sickness or holiday in the us . 
  in the uk , full time employees are entitled to 28 days paid leave a year . 
  it 's the polar opposite and not half way american . 
  the uk is a monarchy and your head of state is also `` the supreme governor of the church of england '' . 
  the us has a strict separation of church and state . 
  on the other hand most people in the uk do n't care about religion and are agnostic or atheist while in the us 60 % of the population says that `` religion plays an important role in their lives '' . 
  it 's the polar opposite in both directions . 
  naming religion as an example of how the english are `` halfway american '' is absurd .
