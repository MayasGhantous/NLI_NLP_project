  not for translating french to german or german to french but to translate swiss german to german . 
  you can be a native german speaker and have no fucking idea what a swiss person is talking about . 
  do n't worry , from now on we only do it for the lulz . 
  hyperbole , the essence of propaganda and fearmongering . 
   it 's a pretty open place from both sides the place got closed several days before obama even arrived . 
  the audience was invited/handpicked . 
  people who live near the place were not allowed to open their windows , had to show their id before they were allowed to enter their own home . 
  8,000 policemen were on duty , the complete airspace over berlin got shut down for an hour when obama landed . 
  he not only brought hundreds of security guards but also a team of navy seals . 
  why they still felt the need for bullet proof glass i have no idea . 
  as far as i remember no other american president had that before when speaking there . 
  quite ironic to speak there behind a wall of glass . 
  edit : there were many more safety measures , those are just the ones that came to my mind in a few seconds . 
  if you watch the video you can see that * everything * is shut down around that place , snipers on every roof . 
  right , how could i forget that . 
  the triumvirate of jokes about germany that are older than the internet : * the german language sounds rude * i did nazi that coming * do n't mention the war, 
  nah , everyone knows your country was completly innocent . 
  you 're welcome . 
  in my opinion domestic violence is not increasing for two reasons : * either you are a violent parent or you are n't . 
  just because the kids get older does n't mean parents suddenly become violent . 
  * domestic violence tends to decrease when the kids get older because they become able to defend themself . 
  [ rammstein - pussy ] ( http://www.redtube.com/25232 ) is literally hardcore porn and hosted on redtube . 
  ( nsfw obviously ), 
  there are no work restrictions in the eu . 
  these 2 million new jobs would n't only be open for german citizens . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/obama-in-berlin/article117089348/barack-obama-besucht-berlin-termine-amp-programm.html ) translation : he will hold his speech in front of 4500 invited guests of politics and business and 600 pupils . 
  the checkpoint is still around but obama does n't go there . 
  he will hold a speech in front of the brandenburg gate for a ** handpicked ** crowd . 
  thanks !, 
  no problem . 
   you are our bitch !, 
  at least we are n't america 's hat . 
  please do n't use link shorteners in the future because these comments always get caught in the spam filter . 
  your statement is quite ironic but i still agree with you . 
  a `` bock bier '' is a [ strong beer in german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bock ) . 
  so a super bock sounds like a super strong beer . 
  a pilsener named super bock sounds promising . 
   super bock is that a beer ? 
  i do n't think this is going to happen , at least not with merkel . 
   three barriers block germany taking on that leadership -- all understandable ones . 
  the first and hardest to surmount is historical . 
  even the word for leader , f\u00fchrer , conjures up terrible memories . 
  having twice plunged europe into war , many germans believe their country 's duty is to be a bigger version of switzerland : economically prosperous , politically modest . 
  this reason is huge . 
  the smallest mistake in leadership will be answered by `` 4th reich '' accusations and pictures of merkel in nazi uniform . 
  the german goverment wants to avoid this understandibly and prefers to take as few risks as possible . 
  that 's one `` now '' too many ( or too much ? 
  i 'm not sure if i understand you correctly . 
  when i turn on the news i want to be told the facts how they actually happened . 
  i do n't want a news network `` balancing '' the facts for me to make it `` fair '' . 
  it 's something different with opinion pieces of course . 
  if you think about it , with a slogan like `` fair and balanced '' they admit to be biased . 
  a news broadcaster who only reports the facts could n't guarantee the viewers to only report `` balanced '' news . 
  facts are often unfair and unbalanced . 
  so it 's basically like a polish `` onion '' ? 
  exactly . 
  [ worst bild headline of all time ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wykmtdl.jpg ), 
  that 's a lot of downvotes for a relevant submission . 
   why was germany , an ally , so important ? 
  probably industrial espionage : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/echelon#controversy, 
  you 're right . 
  maybe norwegians , but not the average european . 
  is the whole world going fascist ? 
  what is going on lately ? 
  fair enough . 
  yet . 
  the dollar price is without taxes . 
  a free photo app like instagram based in berlin . 
  do n't forget [ `` der postillon '' ] ( http://www.der-postillon.com/ ) . 
  seems like we are in for many surprises in the next days and weeks . 
  that 's very nice of you guys , thanks !, 
  as we learned in the last decade the us does n't really care about international law and the un . 
  if they do n't follow it on their own there is absolutely nothing we can do , except maybe for trade sanctions and strong worded letters . 
  maybe it 's the free internet porn , not the economy . 
  nazis , of course . 
  it 's a perfect example of godwin 's law . 
  he opened and ended the discussion with his first comment . 
   complaining about a stereotype ( eastern europeans are criminals/leeches etc. ), 
  the point is nobody said that . 
  the video report is as neutral as it gets . 
  with making it impossible to talk about certain topics like adults in a factual manner he only helps the people he pretends to hate . 
  i watched the video before posting it and it is 100 % neutral . 
  it does nothing else than reporting the fact that people from a village in romania are moving to berlin . 
  the whole `` filthy subhumans '' talk was brought up by you . 
  i ca n't believe i fell for the trap to engage in a discussion with you because nothing of value will come out of it , just insults and made up accusations . 
  i do n't know what you are expecting from me . 
  do you want me to be racist just so i fit your expectations ? 
  i do n't have any strong feelings towards this situation . 
  i would be glad if moving to berlin helps these people to live a better life , though . 
  i asked first . 
  how did you get the impression that i am `` shocked by the filthy subhumans from eastern europe '' ? 
  if rumors turn out to be facts they stop being a conspiracy . 
  they hand it over to the british . 
  but it makes for a heartwarming story . 
  maybe you want to crosspost it here : / r/timelapse, 
  if i had a say i would want all countries to be free and democratic , ruled by the people without a spying goverment , without censorship and so on but this wish goes * especially * for the most powerful country on the planet . 
  i 'm not saying the us is n't a free country anymore but the mere thought about how they could influence the world when they keep going this road sends shivers down my spine . 
  a you referring to my submission title ? 
  so many great pictures , especially number 13 . 
  talking loud in public and wearing baseball hats .
