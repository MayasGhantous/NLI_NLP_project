  it 's no basis to solve problems . 
  it just creates negative emotions and drives people further apart . 
   no one in the countries not immediately at risk gives a shit , people deserve this and it will , surely , ultimately be good for them , children need discipline . 
  this is absolutely not true and it makes me sad that people actually believe this . 
  there is a big percentage of germans who sympathize with the greek and other southern europeans . 
  i was on a huge demonstration yesterday in berlin with tens of thousands of other people who protested against the powerful banks , the bad treatment of southern european countries and the bad treatment of the poorer people in general . 
  there were countless political speeches in favor of treating all countries equal and for international solidarity . 
  again , it makes me sad that people from southern europe think the germans do n't give a shit or even worse we would be happy to see others fail .

  there were demonstrations in many big cities . 
  i saw people waving greek flags , spanish flags , portuguese flags , even an palestinian flag . 
  only one kind of flag was nowhere to be seen , can you guess which one ? 
   to manage the next international crisis now that 's a nice euphemism . 
  the internet is always right . 
  please pick up your new passport at the turkish embassy . 
  norway, 
  what is higher education and secondary education ? 
   you 're on an american website . 
  i can access this website from europe just fine . 
  if you guys want to stay by yourselves you should wall the internet off . 
  ask north korea for advice on this . 
   no need to answer for us . 
  i expressed * my * opinion on this topic , nothing else . 
  if you disagree you could explain to me why and if it makes sense i am the first one two admit i was wrong . 
  i am sorry you got downvoted for answering a question . 
  this subreddit has no manners sometimes . 
  damn , i forgot about iceland . 
  that 's what i should have selected but now i settled with norway . 
  they get told it every day from a very young age and some of them still believe it when they are adults . 
  many years ago i read that the dutch royals have a bigger fortune than the british royals . 
  tried to google it just now but there is lots of contradictory information . 
  does someone have better knowledge about this ? 
  you are right , and most of them will play in the semi finals . 
  i am excited and really looking forward to the next two days . 
  in the next two days are the champions league semi finals . 
  tuesday the 30th of april real madrid vs. borussia dortmund and wednesday the 1st of may barcelona vs. bayern munich . 
  this are the 4 best clubs in the world fighting for the a place in the final . 
  from a skill perspective these matches are even better than those at the world cup . 
  if i am not mistaken the games are broadcasted in the us . 
  / r/soccer will have a thread about 30 minutes before the matches begin with information where you can watch it . 
  i 'm sure it will get more popular in the next years . 
  the us women 's national team is already world class and the men will close the gap in the next years , too . 
  i am actually following it a bit since klinsmann is their coach . 
  socialist is not the perfect word to describe this system , that 's why i put it in quotes . 
  i only found out about this when i read an absurd article on conservapedia where they tried very hard to `` explain '' why soccer is a socialist sport played by liberal communists . 
  it was a great piece of comedy that sadly got replaced by an almost reasonable article about soccer by now . 
  what is really interesting about the nfl draft is that it takes an almost `` socialist '' approach in distributing the new players . 
  if i am not mistaken the weakest team is allowed to pick first and by this has the advantage of getting the best player . 
  on one hand this allows for a very balanced league , on the other hand it goes against the core values america stands for . 
  he wo n't because he made that up . 
  you guys have it rough , my condolences . 
   prosecutor henrik rassmusson has since revealed that the uploader 's static ip address was easily traced back to an isp . 
  using a static ip does n't seem very smart to me . 
  i doubt spiegel online pays anybody for linking to their site . 
  if you want to submit an article to / r/europe in a different language than english you must provide at least a short translation in the comment section .

  carry as few shit with you as possible . 
  make sure your bikes have proper lighting . 
  have fun . 
  they never made bad experiences with nationalism like germany for example . 
  all their wars get fought overseas and even when they lose one , like vietnam , the damage is not noticable to the average citizen . 
  patriotism just did n't get connected with anything negative yet . 
  the second one was as democratic as the democratic people 's republic of korea . 
  in theory i am perfectly fine with it , especially since german police seems to be [ extremly reluctant ] ( http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/05/german-police-used-only-85-bullets-against-people-2011/52162/ ) to use their guns against people . 
  the problem is that i ca n't be sure if i only feel that way because i was born into it . 
  i do n't know how it would be to have police without guns in germany . 
  [ with full force ] ( http://withfullforce.de/index.php?&amp;lang=en ), 
  some people are offended by anything , this should n't be the basis for laws . 
  i hope we can abolish all blasphemy and thought crime laws together as the eu . 
  this would be a long overdue step in the right direction . 
  maybe a stupid question , but how are the chances of employment ? 
  i would love to live in a warm climate zone country with european standards . 
  just because something is the law does n't necessarily mean it 's right . 
  we have some silly blasphemie laws in germany as well , it 's ridiculous . 
  going to jail for `` insulting '' an idea that probably is n't even true has no place in any modern society . 
  that pun that you think got totally over my head ? 
  i did not see that coming !, 
  yes , it just bothers me sometimes that even on serious topics all comments are jokes . 
  that 's what you got out of this article ? 
  hi llorengarcia , if you want to submit an article to / r/europe in a different language than english you must provide a short translation in the comment section . 
  otherwise too few subscribers can understand it and it does n't add any value to the community . 
  please do n't use url shorteners in the future . 
  more than 50,000 troops , just no tanks . 
  [ commanderspleen explained it already better than i could do it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1bevw5/at_the_end_of_the_2nd_world_war_there_was_a_plan/c969p9b ) . 
  that 's the famous humour gap between britain and germany i guess . 
  it 's supposed to be funny , not factual . 
  only two kinds of people were totally innocent in wwii : jews and austrians . 
  that 's exactly how it went , one part of the money left via london and the other part via russia . 
  that 's why they had to raise the percentages because a big chunk of the money is gone . 
  they even transferred millions when the transfers were officially blocked . 
  there are people who seem to be above the law and this is were the true problems are . 
   `` like hitler , angela merkel has declared war on the rest of the continent , this time to secure economic lebensraum , '' ... & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  there is a certain kind of demographic who hate everyone the tabloids tell them to hate . 
  this comes from a lack of education and because they are too lazy or unable to think for themself . 
  still , i think these group of people is smaller than the media makes it appear . 
  i do n't think you will find many germans who are `` excessively proud '' of their country . 
  edit to add something : i am german and i live of 750 euro per month . 
  thinking that all germans are `` doing very nicely '' is a delusion . 
  many germans sympathize with the people from greece and cyprus , even when the media makes it look otherwise . 
  if it were trade the us would have top notch relations with china right now .
