  they tried to multiply but substracted themself instead . 
  also , post some of that content you like to see more yourself !, 
  do n't be afraid of downvotes for your submissions . 
  if you did n't create the content , the article or whatever yourself but just linked to it there is no reason to take it personally . 
  just try it again whenever you find something of value and post it again . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that . 
  to me , being german is some kind of mindset . 
  a believe in certain values , human rights , rule of law and so on and if an immigrant can agree on these by heart i consider them as `` germans '' no different than anyone else . 
  sadly there are many idiots who make it an issue of colour or genes instead of shared values and i can see how this is frustrating . 
  but to stay on topic here , i still think the einb\u00fcrgerungstest should include yodeling the appenzeller in lederhosen in front of a jury . 
  it does n't make any sense but would be a riot . 
  yeah , thanks for asking , 
  wearing lederhosen and yodeling a flawless appenzeller is the least we should expect . 
  mods can remove posts but ca n't delete them . 
  if a post he made or a post he commented on got removed for the reasons stated he could still link to said posts and everyone could access and see it . 
  can you please point out such a post of factual statistics that got removed for racism ?

  i know the sequel and the third part already and enjoyed them both . 
  i 'm really digging the style of the movies so your suggestion is very much appreciated .

  the head mod of / r/pics is n't an admin and without his approval it just does n't work that way . 
  if there is a word filter for `` victoria '' the mods implemented it themselves . 
  that would never have happened . 
  how are a few admins supposed to run even a single subreddit with almost 10 million subscribers ? 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  do you have any proof ? 
  for those interested in it : / r/autobahn, 
  removing a post for being `` random local news '' was a mistake by one of the new moderators . 
  we discussed it internally , reinstated the link and apologized for it publicly . 
  it 's about a message that can be shown with a single paiting and understood by everyone . 
  i think he did well . 
  [ never forget ] ( http://cdnl.reportage.wdr.de/v1/main/video_files/000/001/304/medium.webm?n=58479&amp;t=1405530166212 ), 
  mods do n't interfere with reposts if no other rule is broken . 
  it 's up to the community to judge them and up - or downvote them accordingly . 
   i find it even more disturbing when unarmed police officers have to beg for their lives in front of the public where did that happen ? 
  why laugh `` at the germans '' ? 
  do you think the majority here is in favor of this treasonous bullshit ? 
  [ we did exactly this a few decades ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sonderkommando_elbe ), 
  we went from the `` war mongering , genocidal , militaristic robots '' stereotype to `` defenseless pussies fighting with broomstcks '' in a matter of months . 
  i 'm not sure if that says more about germans or about stereotypes in general . 
  germany getting blamed for being too peaceful . 
  i feel like i 'm taking opposite pills .
