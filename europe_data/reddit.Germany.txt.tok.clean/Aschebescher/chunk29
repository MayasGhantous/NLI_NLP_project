  in case of paywall : magdeburg , germany -- each day , trucks roll into this city filled with the latest hot import from the streets of manchester , england : garbage . 
  the destination is a power plant that makes a business of turning trash into electricity , or as it touts in a brochure , `` spinning straw into gold . '' the straw in this case is large , pillowy blobs of rubbish , neatly wrapped in plastic . 
  recycling and trash bins recycling and trash bins `` like a marshmallow , '' beams rolf oesterhoff , manager of the mhkw rothensee waste-to-energy plant . 
  a waste not , want not attitude mixed with a national zeal for recycling has led to an awkward problem for germany : it is n't producing enough of its own trash . 
  over the past decade , heaps of garbage-burning power plants and composting facilities were built throughout germany as the country shut off all its landfills to new household trash . 
  but instead of growing , as many thought it would , household-waste production flattened , in part because sparing germans edged their already-high recycling rate even higher . 
  taken with the effects of a declining population and the global recession , plants in germany were left short millions of tons of garbage a year , a quandary for companies that depend on a steady stream of rubbish to keep the lights on . 
  so the country turned to its trashier neighbors . 
  now by boat and by truck , waste is piling in from england , ireland , italy and switzerland , among others , to plants , where it gets burned and converted to electricity that keeps german households on the grid . 
  in magdeburg , about 100 miles from berlin , the trash is converted to electricity for one-third of the city , and heating for roughly 50,000 homes . 
  the imports are made possible by a european union directive to gradually phase out landfills . 
  that has led to higher taxes on landfill use in countries like great britain , making the trans-border shipping economically feasible .

  photo : eliot brown / the wall street journal yet while the netherlands and sweden have made a business out of importing and processing their neighbors ' waste , rising rubbish imports are causing a backlash in germany , where recycling and generally reducing waste is something of a national obsession . 
  the reverence of reduction dates back decades . 
  in 1991 , germany passed a sweeping law that institutionalized recycling , one that helped inspire movements in other countries including the u.s. , where about 34 % of waste is now recycled . 
  today , the recycling rate here counts among the highest in the world , by some measures , at roughly 65 % of household trash . 
  within houses and apartments , kitchen waste bins can have four or more compartments for sorting various categories of recycling . 
  further down the rubbish chain , communal containers in the courtyards or basements of apartment buildings span almost the full rainbow spectrum : in berlin , there are different-colored bins for clear , brown and green glass , yellow bins for some plastic -- but not all -- brown bins for organic refuse , blue ones for paper and cardboard -- but not all -- and black or gray bins for everything else . 
  `` we are a german generation that grew up with recycling , '' said stefan korn , a 30-year-old berlin resident . 
  mr. korn is a founder of the boutique upcycling deluxe gmbh , one of a half dozen of so-called `` upcycling '' stores in berlin . 
  they take old clothing and other refuse and reconstitute it as chic handicrafts and apparel -- at a less-than-trashy price .

  even at the magdeburg power plant , recycling is a big deal . 
  when the boilers are cleaned , metal from the coals is picked out with magnets , while the remaining ash is sold to an asphalt company , being reborn in the form of german roads . 
  so when it comes to importing trash , this culture of refuse reduction makes some germans wary of cleaning up the rest of europe 's mess . 
  first , there is the issue of odor . 
  when irish garbage piled up , lying unmoved for weeks , near a pier in the midsize port city of bremerhaven in northern germany last year , the light smell turned to a wafting stench , and residents grew queasy . 
  `` it was a terrible time ... it smelled so awful , '' said karlheinz michen , a member of the bremerhaven city council . 
  `` there were so many flies in the area . '' politicians intervened , and the trash moved on to its final destination of hamburg . 
  hamburg used to favor importing waste , and the city had a small contract with an english city to take care of its trash . 
  but hamburg city officials -- feeling embarrassed about their relatively low recycling rate of about 40 % -- made a big push to improve it . 
  that meant less trash , which meant shutting down one waste-to-energy plant , leaving less free capacity . 
  closures like those in hamburg are happening around the country for older and inefficient plants -- welcome news for plants that can go on to charge higher prices to municipalities to dispose of their trash . 
  `` we are definitely in a good mood , '' said peter werz , spokesman for eew energy from waste , which owns the magdeburg plant . 
  the mood is a shift from three to four years ago , when the german price for waste was far lower -- around $ 35 per ton compared with $ 55 to $ 80 per ton today , according to tolvik consulting . 
  ultimately , such capacity reductions and rising waste prices may make it uneconomical for neighboring countries to ship their trash to germany . 
  but with declining trash production at home and other eu countries still phasing out landfills , the magdeburg plant remains open , provided it has the space , to future imports of others ' waste . 
  `` not their waste , '' corrects mr. werz . 
  `` their energy . '',

  by abstaining we basically voted yes . 
  i 'm fine with that because we do n't need to be the center of attention in this heated issue . 
  it 's about the palestineans and about peace , not about germany . 
  you are not allowed to move freely for example . 
   prostitutes do that job because they have no choice . 
  this is a generalisation and not true . 
  tits and violence , the french have all the fun . 
  i would prefer it if the uk would fully commit to the eu and think it 's in the best interest of both . 
  however , if they do n't want to do that it 's about time to plan without them . 
  that is the most rational and efficient approach to food i 've every heard of ( besides astronaut food ) . 
  the swiss are more german than the germans themself . 
  that sounds quite good actually . 
  will try it as soon as i find a supermarket that carries heinz baked beans . 
  i just recognized i never tried anything that could be called `` british cuisine '' . 
  one reason is that i have never been to britain , another reason is the i have n't seen a british restaurant anywhere in europe in my whole life . 
  edit : i had fish & chips in berlin once , no idea if it was authentic . 
  germany 's fault . 
   9/11/1974 - raf terrorist holger meins dies in prison after two months in hunger strike what kind of will power or desperation do you need to have to hunger yourself to death ? 
  blows my mind . 
  this is the only reason why the uk does n't want to commit to the eu . 
  they do n't want to be part of something where they do n't have the leading role . 
  this is why i blocked / r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu a long time ago . 
  according to this poll france is worse than belarus & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  seems like the european redditors are older an average than the american redditors . 
  could this be true ? 
  agreed . 
  another reaon is that every atrocity from wwii is very well documented , some even on video . 
  every country is allowed to be proud of it 's atrocities except germany :-(, 
  could be beanfart 's alternative account . 
  that 's the tricky part . 
  will the people greece come up with a solution themself or has the solution to come from the outside ? 
  if the solution comes from the outside will the people of greece accept it ? 
  it 's the convenience of being able to buy high calorie food within minutes after you got hungry . 
  it needs a lot of will power and effort to eat healthy and more and more people fall victim to the convenience of unhealthy food , myself included . 
  it 's basically a tax evading sheme disguised as a state . 
  i did not downvote you btw .
