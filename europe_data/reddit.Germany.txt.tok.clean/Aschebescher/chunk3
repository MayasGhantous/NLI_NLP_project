  do you really believe this ? 
   many english people like to think they 're closer to the usa than the eu , so that 's what i meant about half way american . 
  people might think that because of a shared language and as a consequence shared media but i have yet to see anything that makes the english appear more american than other europeans . 
  i would go as far and say it 's the opposite and most european countries have adopted bigger parts of american culture than the english . 
   england is like a halfway point between the us and europe besides the shared language and pop culture i have no idea what part of england is halfway american . 
  could you elaborate on this ? 
  i made a subreddit some time ago to collect jokes about germany/germans . 
  it 's not very active but can be found here : / r/jokesaboutgermany, 
  til we were trending yesterday : http://www.reddit.com/r/trendingreddits/comments/2c24dk/trending_reurope_europe_774_subscribers_today_444/, 
  these two seconds tell so much about germany . 
  i agree that / r/de should be default in all three german speaking countries but what am i supposed to do ? 
  i do n't have any powers to influence this and we will have to wait until pinwale asks us if we want to opt in . 
  no , never heard that one . 
  i 'm no expert but i remeber reading about it some time ago and the article made clear that you can only be sure to not get tracked if you cut the energy supply . 
  if that is the right interpretation i stand corrected . 
  because germany is made up of many small regions there are many different styles of folk music . 
  the people from the north who are living at the north sea have a very unique style that i personally like very much . 
  the lyrics are almost always about sailors , the sea , the storm and waves and sometimes far away countries that could only get reached by ship in the last centuries . 
  this is an example of a really nice song interpreted by different groups and singers : * [ wo de nordseewellen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wdkxi5vbpg ) . 
  -- `` muss i denn , muss i denn zum st\u00e4dtele hinaus '' is a german folk song from swabia written in 1827 that became known world wide [ when elvis presley sang it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9w6m_phxq4 ) in 1960 . 
  it got adapted to english and is known as `` wooden heart '' . 
  [ here is a proper german version sung by heino ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyucovhhcpq ) . 
  the proper version of all german folk songs is always the one sung by heino , that 's a law of nature  -- another one of my favorites is '' [ denn im wald da sind die r\u00e4uber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdxadtik-oi ) '' . 
  the refrain is very catchy and invites to clap along and the lyrics are incredibly sexist . 
  it 's basically about warning young girls to not go into the forest alone because there are groups of men ( hunters and robbers ) who will rape them . 
  because that 's just what men do . 
  and of course it 's not called rape but `` seducing '' . 
  sexosm was so casual in the earlier centuries it 's fascinating . 
  quite possible that i misinterpreted it . 
   just ordinary blue milk ? 
  i prefer my milk to be white . 
  this is indeed a common occurence here in germany and quite sad imho . 
  many great folk songs are perceived negatively because they were sung by the nazis or just because they sound that way . 
  there is also always at least one idiot who uploads the song to youtube with video footage of the nazi military machine . 
  [ this one for example is about a knight from the 16th century ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0p-egt5vek ) and an all around nice folk song . 
  of course someone made a nazi video out of it and the comment section is a clusterfuck of neo nazism and germanophobia . 
  it 's not surprising that this produces a lot of misconceptions . 
  that explains the sharp uniforms and leather coats . 
  reddit does not have that many employees and i ca n't imagine them browsing the the subreddits to find out such minor things . 
   this place is heavily anti-russian and anti-serbian , so that might be a factor too i 'm pretty sure this does n't play any role in reddit 's considerations . 
  that 's exactly what happened . 
  i had already cleared it up hours before the screenshot was taken . 
  for some reason he did n't want to include it in his post to the uncensored free speech subreddit . 
  [ here is the complete conversation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tfwgfws.png ), 
  one of the best ted talks i have ever seen is also about this topic : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv7y0w0xmyq, 
  switching it off is not enough to not get tracked . 
  you have to physically remove the battery to be sure . 
  too much religious mambo jambo for my taste . 
  it should have some strong and positive words that are based on reality . 
  the main stanza of the german anthem is not bad in that regard . 
  one can stand behind those no matter if conservative or liberal , religious or atheist . 
  yes , but the judical gymnastics our goverment is performing for this is ridiculous . 
  for the afghanistan deployment they basically claimed a state of defense to justify it . 
  `` germany gets defended at the hindukush '' was the claim . 
  our politicians do this to please nato and especially the us but in my humble opinion they are acting unconstitutionally . 
  hi / u/tartantyco , this is friendly reminder of reddiquette for you . 
  it says :  please do n't be ( intentionally ) rude at all . 
  by choosing not to be rude , you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us . 
  [ this part of reddiquette can be found here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_please__don.27t ) . 
  i 'm not convinced . 
  defending is much more difficult than attacking and you need a 100 % success rate to prevent your own annihilation when nuclear missiles are coming in . 
   you 've been reluctant to assist the united kingdom & france in regional military interventions like libya & mali ( libya not at all , mali only after a fuckton of prodding & the united states only agreeing to give limited support in a attempt to force your hand , which worked to a degree ) , thus they do n't trust you in maintaining regional security & the eu 's hard power in place of the united states . 
  the german constitution is written in way that restricts our military quite a lot . 
  this was done on purpose at a time when germany was n't a sovereign country . 
  the allies wanted to ensure that germany ca n't pose a threat under any circumstances . 
  this means our military is only allowed to act as a defence force when attacked and only on nato territory . 
  sending our military to libya or mali is strictly speaking unconstitutional . 
  criticizing us now for a lack of military support on foreign continents after playing a major part in writing said constitution is a bit unfair imho . 
  today and it 's only a single subreddit so far : / r/de _ iama, 
  i like it . 
  [ the european one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fba8ptx0fve ) is nice as well . 
  sorry , i thought it was obvious what i wanted to imply . 
   france and the uk alone could take the conventional military of russia this was believed by more than one military power in the past and always turned out as wrong . 
  let 's assume it is true this time for the sake of the argument . 
   if we remove their nuclear threat they will have not much left the whole nuclear strategy of russia is based on making this * absolutely fucking impossible * . 
  russia possesses around 8,500 nuclear warheads . 
  they have 489 land based missiles carrying up to 1,788 warheads , 12 submarines carrying up to 609 warheads , 79 bombers carrying up to 884 cruise missiles . 
  they also have hundreds of `` suitcase sized '' nuclear weapons . 
  because their technology to aim and hit a target is slightly inferior to that of the us they have built [ shit like this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9amtueydp0 ) . 
  if such a thing gets set off the blast can still be measured after it went around the globe for a third time . 
  these things are so massive it does n't matter if they get dropped 3km besides the aimed target , they blow up everything anyways . 
  how can anyone believe we could just `` remove their nuclear threat '' ? 
  it just does n't work . 
  if any serious conflict with russia arises no missile shield and no conventional army will save us from anything . 
  edit : russia has a new [ submarine-launched ballistic missile ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r-29rmu2_layner ) in use now that is reportedly ** capable of piercing anti-ballistic missile defences ** . 
  could . 
  but it wo n't work that way . 
  just checked it myself and / r/de _ iama was the only one showing up as default . 
  you can block everything you want with res very easily . 
  just enter the subreddits you do n't want to see in the preferences and that 's it . 
  that would be a useless military investment imho . 
  if we really reach a point that we need a missile defense shield to protect us from incoming russian rockets it 's all over anyways . 
  a few small german language subreddits are defaulted for austria and germany if i am not mistaken . 
  okay . 
  the `` what happened '' post gets featured every week and is usually stickied for at least 3 days . 
  the probability for something else happening `` at this exact same time '' is therefor quite high . 
  the mods enjoy the news roundup as much as everyone else and it 's the most prominently advertised thread of / r/europe . 
  it is linked at the top of the subreddit 24/7 , even right now as we speak . 
  most people know about the basics but some do n't . 
  it 's supposed to clear up misconceptions but also to provide helpful information for those who are interested in it .
