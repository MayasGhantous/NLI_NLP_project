  i think it 's sad that it has become impossible on reddit to have a differing opinion without getting downvoted . 
  i always appreciate and upvote additional information or explanations . 
  does n't matter if i already understood it , i prefer facts over memes and puns . 
  nothing wrong with a detailed explanation . 
  if you already understood what happened just ignore it . 
  i do n't agree with imliterallydyinghere but here is a german news article about this topic : http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tagesspiegel.de%2fberlin%2fkriminalitaet-bauern-an-der-grenze-beklagen-landmaschinen-klau%2f6070026.html&amp;act=url, 
  what will happen to the nuclear waste ? 
  [ the protocols of the elders of zion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protocols_of_the_elders_of_zion ), 
  so i guess nuclear power is the only technology in existence that does n't have a single flaw if there are 0 legitimate concerns . 
  that 's irrelevant , just because it did n't happen in the last 50 years does n't mean it ca n't happen in the future . 
  by the way , about 10 years ago two planes smaller than the a-380 brought down two skyscrapers . 
  i do n't want to say something like this * will * happen again in the future , but to claim it 's impossible is dishonest . 
  i hope the best for poland and europe in general . 
  it 's just that germany does n't have the worst track record in regards to technology , inventions and innovation . 
  that 's why i think starting with nuclear energy in the exact same year as germany is phasing it out could be the wrong decision in the long run . 
  but we will see , i have no say in this matter and i 'm neither a scientist nor an engineer . 
  the future will show . 
   disaster which is impossible to happen in germany because there are no tsunamis there and earthquakes are very small and benign the tsunami disaster is only one of many scenarios that are possible . 
  there is for example not a single nuclear power plant in germany that would withstand the impact of an a-380 airplane . 
  in a densly populated country like germany where thousands of planes are flying every day this should count as a legitimate concern . 
  this sounds indeed good . 
  i do n't want to bash poland , quite the opposite . 
  i am just wondering if it is really that great of an idea for them to invest in nuclear energy . 
  will they even be capable of building the plants on their own ? 
  i honestly doubt that and expect that american or german corporations like siemens will get the mandate to build the reactors . 
  i do n't know , are they ? 
  this sets the premisse that the chernobyl disaster is the worst that ever can happen in the future . 
  it 's just the worst that happened in the past . 
  is every criticism of nuclear energy `` paranoia-driven '' or a so called `` knee-jerk '' reaction ? 
  are n't there at least * some * legitimate concerns ? 
  why ca n't this topic be discussed on reddit without even the most harmless and on topic questions getting downvoted ? 
  like wind , solar or hydro power for example . 
  or even better something completly new nobody thought about yet . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  i consider the use of coal in the transition phase a mistake , too . 
  still investing in renewable energy does n't seem like a mistake to me . 
  welcome to the 1960s , poland . 
  would n't it be smarter to invest in some new technologies ? 
  the shetland one is the hardest to understand , that 's for sure . 
  stermann is german ... 
  silliest accent is clearly scotland but you ca n't choose it . 
  yes , it 's the first one for roma and long overdue . 
  does anyone know about how many holocaust memorials we have now in germany ? 
  i personally know of 3 but there have to be many more . 
  edit : spelling . 
  i would be fine with that . 
  we could build a new capital at the [ geographical centre of europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_midpoint_of_europe ) right now which would be [ here ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=50.1725,9.15&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;t=h&amp;q=50.1725,9.15 ) ;-), 
  yes , and this one is me . 
  there is a thirs one , i just do n't remember the name because i 'm fucking drunk . 
  this is the thids one , called `` old men in new cars '' . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246692/ not as good as the first one but worth a watch if you enjoyed harald and the cooks :-), 
  i think there are big differences in the german military . 
  now there are only voluntary soldiers , but in 1997 when i was there it was different . 
  either you had good luck and the instructors were laid back or you had bad luck and the instructors had something to prove . 
  i had bad luck in the first 3 months of grundausbildung and the instructors were assholes , it was expected from them because of the unit i was deployed to . 
  really bad luck , there is no other explanation . 
  after that i had an easy employment , because they did n't care . 
  but in the first months it was really bad . 
  especially because we all were drafted from the general population . 
  no military fanatics . 
  it sucked . 
  i got yelled at all day . 
  they like people who do n't question anything and can run 5km in less than 25 minutes . 
  if one person from the whole platoon does something wrong , which happens quite often in the first weeks , everyone gets punished for it . 
  i hated it so much but there was no way out once i started it . 
  this depends on so many things . 
  do you want to sleep in a single room or a shared room ? 
  a single room in germany is at least 35-40 euro and a shared room in a hostel is about 12-15 euro per day . 
  food is very cheap , about 5 euro per day if you want to buy it in the supermarket but can go up to 15 euro per meal if you want to eat in a restaurant . 
  i was there as well , and some years later i served my time at the bundeswehr . 
  one of the biggest mistakes of my life . 
  yes . 
  there is even a third movie . 
  they are all enjoyable but the first one is the most awesome . 
  i am always astonished not more people have watched them . 
  only about 25 kilometers apart . 
  we a practically brothers , hehe :-), 
  yeah , i 'm addicted to this fucking website so i am not surprised you see me everywhere . 
  where are you from ? 
  i fear this will be ignored but there is a danish movie i really love very much . 
  it is called `` i kina spiser de hunde '' and it is pure awesomeness . 
  if you have n't seen it you should . 
  it 's ganster comedy par excellance . 
  highly recommended . 
  it 's a great and short movie , only about 80 minutes . 
  watch it !, 
  malaysia where you get a public flogging for minor offenses is progressive ? 
  the aqueduct . 
  that 's the main reason the eu got founded in my opinion . 
  to actively do something to maintain peace . 
  i do n't know , i am not on the committee . 
  no world wars since 1945 . 
  this prize is well deserved . 
  i stopped smoking pot in 1999 . 
  faz is a pretty reliable newspaper . 
  it was your fellow countryman who brought it up . 
  it 's tough to be number one . 
  i think the river rhine played a major role in this developement . 
  we need more awesome projects like arte in europe . 
   also , does anyone know the conditions under which other nato states are required by treaty to intervene in turkey 's defense ?
