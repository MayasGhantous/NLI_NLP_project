  so many factual errors in this article . 
  seems he just wanted to write about an obvious stereotype without doing any research . 
  this is clearly a step backwards .

  will read it again tomorrow when i 'm sober . 
  i 'm a bit drunk and not sure if this is the best moment for me to translate this text properly , but until someone else can do it better i will try it : in the original it says : `` warum sage ich jetzt erst , gealtert und mit letzter tinte : die atommacht israel gef\u00e4hrdet den ohnehin br\u00fcchigen weltfrieden ? '', 
  the translation of the guardian is : `` it means israel is as bad as iran , and it 's about time germans stopped feeling hamstrung by the holocaust and said so . '', 
  the true translation , imho would be : `` why do i say it only now , old and with my last ink : the nuclear-power israel is endangering the already fragile world peace '' that 's quite a remarkable differnce in my opinion . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong .

  this is an actual ad , no joke . 
  i think so . 
  that 's just not true . 
  fox news is far more biased and manipulating . 
  and i say that as a bild hater . 
  `` hundreds of meters '' seems a bit excessive and expensive to me . 
  i must admit i have no clue about all this . 
  it 's just my overall impression that he seems to not be a daily drinker like for example jelzin .

  hello r/europe subscribers !, 
  it has been almost a year since the last official mod post . 
  since then the number of subscribers has more than doubled and the amount of work the moderators have to deal with has grown accordingly . 
  ** some milestones of r/europe : ** jun 13 , 2013 --  r/europe hits 30k subscribers dec 3 , 2013 --  r/europe hits 40k subscribers may 11 , 2014 --  r/europe hits 50k subscribers [ source ] ( http://redditmetrics.com/r/europe ) -- we want to show you some statistics and infographics about our activities of moderation to give those who are interested in it some insight . 
  these visualizations are very detailled and include every single moderator action over the time span of three months between 01 . 
  april and 29 . 
  june 2014 . 
  ( all credit for creating these graphics goes to / u/bezbojnicul ) * [ click here for stats of the last three months of r/europe moderation ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wgf2z ) * [ click here for biweekly stats from april - june 2014 of r/europe moderation ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yfvnz ) * [ click here for a word cloud of all comments made within one month in r/europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qrqvw4u.png ) -- ** now to the main part of this modpost that we created for two reasons : ** 1 ) to remind you about our rules and guidelines , what actions we take in case they are broken and to receive feedback on how this can be improved . 
  2 ) to recruite new moderators , preferably from our own subscriber base . 
  -- ** 1 ) about our rules and guidelines and what actions we take in case they are broken : ** in general we want to make it as uncomplicated as possible , that 's why all rules of r/europe are based on [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) . 
  there are some parts of reddiquette that we deem especially important , though , and that we will enforce strictly in order to keep this community a civil and welcoming place and to maintain a reasonable level of discourse . 
  * ** rules will be enforced by the moderators . 
  ** users who break rules will receive a warning via pm or a distinguished comment or may be temporary or permanently banned depending on the offenses . 
  certain offenses are ban-on-sight , and all bans are up to the mod 's discretion . 
  * ** guidelines will not be enforced by the moderators . 
  ** if a user does n't follow them it is up to the community to vote on it according to individual judgement . 
  -- ** our behaviour rules : ** * please do n't be ( intentionally ) rude at all . 
  by choosing not to be rude , you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us . 
  if we see this rule getting broken , we will give a warning and ban those who continue to engage in this type of behavior . 
  * do n't troll for the sake of trolling .
