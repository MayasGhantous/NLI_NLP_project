  after one week of deliberation we have invited three new moderators . 
  all three are members of this community . 
  please give a warm welcome to : * / u/obraka * / u/coffeh * / u/slyratchet we want to give the new guys and us some time to get familiar with the new situation , after that we consider a second round of recruitement [ from our application thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2a2r0c/moderator_application_thread_reurope_is/ ) . 
  thanks to everyone who applied !, 
  also constructing luxury yachts , constructing machines that can build/produce stuff , breeding dogs , fetish porn , making sausages and cold cuts , mett . 
  that 's news to me . 
  it 's also the best combination if you want to have access to the maximum amount of knowledge . 
  the second most articles on wikipedia are in german for example and even here on reddit german is the second most spoken language after english . 
  still , the effort that is needed to learn german properly is very high and english is already dominating everything . 
  you already speak the most helpful language . 
  the second most spoken language in europe is german by far but if you do n't plan on settling down in a german speaking country or have a specific interest in the culture or media it 's just not worth the effort . 
  edit : just saw the [ gap between french and german is n't as big as i expected ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union ) . 
  who do you mean ? 
  i never had kuttelsuppe . 
  `` because it just is '' is not a very smart and convincing explanation . 
  most people in the west think the same about raw fish . 
  yet when the japanese prepare it it tastes great and nobody gets sick from eating it . 
   but eating raw meat is still wrong . 
  why ? 
  can you explain how i am wrong ? 
  i heard about himmel und erde very often but never had it so far . 
  i 'll have to try it as soon as i see it somewhere in a restaurant . 
  i would n't say there is zero health risk . 
  there is always a health risk if you eat something . 
  it 's just very low if it is prepared properly . 
  there are very strict health laws in germany . 
  the meat is only allowed to be sold if it was prepared on the same day . 
  sometimes it is so fresh they prepare it in front of your eyes . 
  i have never heard of anyone getting sick from it . 
  if that happened the butchery would get closed by the health authorities on the same day . 
  yes , it is !, 
  yes , so many people love that shit , i have no idea why . 
  it 's a sauce with mushrooms . 
  my favorites are [ j\u00e4gerschnitzel with fries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yhelzv3.jpg ) ( pic is oc by the way ) and [ mettbr\u00f6tchen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/489dmf4.jpg ) . 
  the worst for me personally is [ esparagus ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/spargel_sauce_hollandaise.jpg ) but so many people love it here and my opinion is not representative . 
  i think you are underestimating the grade of organisation that is involved there , especially at clubs with huge fan-clubs like dortmund or frankfurt . 
  almost everything is planned and sometimes even rehearsed and the people involved are taking it very seriously . 
  * d\u00f6ner kebap * the autobahn * the certainty that most people follow the rules, 
   what are the nicest locations to visit or stay in ? 
  i 'm not one for huge crowds but i would love to see your best sites . 
  the most interesting cities are berlin , hamburg and munich . 
  i think most tourists like the countryside of bavaria , with mountains and castles . 
  personally i love the north sea and the [ wattenmeer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wadden_sea ) but i have never heard of foreign tourists going there , so i 'm not sure if you would enjoy it . 
   what is your favorite time of the year , the month with the nicest weather ? 
  july and august have the nicest weather . 
   what are the biggest do 's and do n'ts of your culture ? 
  we do n't want to risk offending you fine people . 
  just use common sense . 
  germans are not easily offended and our cultures are not that different . 
  [ in china they eat dogs ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180748/ ), 
  a team from south america for sure . 
  being unpunctual in germany . 
   what do you guys hate most about americans ? 
  nationalism and [ american exceptionalsim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ) .
