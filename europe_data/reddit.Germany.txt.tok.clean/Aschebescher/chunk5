  in the end you are right , though . 
  the headline is editoralized which breaks one of our few rules , and i removed it now . 
  the second one got removed immediatly , before anyone could even comment on it . 
  the first one 's headline seems to be a summary of what happened which is allowed according to our rules . 
  i do n't think you have fully understood the implications of having access to the head-mod account . 
  it 's basically like owning the ring in lord of the rings . 
  you can call the person a `` janitor '' but if he has access he has absolute powers no matter what name you give him . 
  you also ca n't police this person . 
  you can oberserve what he is doing but ca n't stop him from anything . 
   the existence of a weak point does n't make it less democratic , imho . 
  i 'm not sure about that . 
  for something to be democratic the people need to have actual power to vote/make decisions and they need insight and information about what 's going on . 
  at least the first of these two points can not be assured based on the design of reddit where one person holds powers that can overrule any democratic process . 
  i do n't think it would be a problem because it works exactly that way right now . 
  it just makes it impossible to make a subreddit 100 % democratic because the community will always have to trust one person blindly without having the potential to hold this person accountable . 
  this is by definition undemocratic and the weak point that can not be circumvented . 
  now that you say it i have to agree . 
  prestige comes to play in other situations as well . 
  personal attacks and name calling are examples of being intentionally rude . 
  it ca n't be circumvented with a bot because someone has to set it up . 
  for setting it up you need the password and the person with the password has the head-mod powers . 
  if you can come up with a solution to this problem you will be a very popular person here on reddit because many subreddits are interested in a democratic solution but so far noone has found a way to make it work . 
  think about a situation where you are driving on the autobahn on the left lane already quite fast , maybe around 180 km/h , and you are constantly overtaking cars that are slower than you . 
  you recognize a car in the mirror coming from behind that is driving faster than you , maybe around 220 km/h . 
  you are already quite fast and had planned to stay on the left lane to overtake several other cars going slower on the right lane but you have to make a decision now . 
  stay on the left lane and force the car behind you to slow down or change lanes to the right to make room and having to slow down yourself ? 
  that 's when ( at least for some people ) \u00dcberholprestige comes to play . 
  if the car coming closer from behind is just a tuned vw polo and [ looks like this in the mirror ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u05kegw.jpg ) you stay on the left lane and force him to slow down because that car does n't have any \u00dcberholprestige . 
  if the car coming from behind [ looks like this in the mirror ] ( http://i.imgur.com/llgjdzs.png ) you change lanes and slow down yourself because that one has \u00dcberholprestige . 
  it 's no every-day word either but i definitely have heard it more than once . 
  outside of the car industry or tv shows where they present luxury cars it is unlikely to come across it , though . 
   what makes you think that this sub would not benefit from being more democratic ? 
  i would really like to see a democratic subreddit in practice to see how it works , what the upsides and downsides are and so on . 
  out of the 10.000 active subreddits there are probably hundreds that would implement such a feature immediatly . 
  the reason why not a single subreddit has succeeded in running the community democratic lies in the design of reddit . 
  at the very core it has a presetting that can not be changed and that is 100 % undemocratic . 
  this is the position of the head moderator . 
  the user who has this position has all powers over the subreddit , he can do whatever he wants without the possibility for anyone to hold him accountable . 
  the head mod of / r/europe could remove all posts , remove all other mods and change this community to a porn subreddit within the next hour and nobody could stop him . 
  ** as long as there is one person holding the position of a moderator in a subreddit a real democracy is impossible and nobody besides the admins can change that fact . 
  ** the only way to circumvent this is to remove all moderators , but then comes the next unsolvable problem . 
  as soon as the last moderator has left the subreddit it can be requested via / r/redditrequest and the user who requests it first will be made moderator by the admins . 
  that 's 25k for every single transaction of information , though . 
  not what they gave him for a year of work . 
  speaking for me personally i can say that i do n't feel offended by these comments . 
  i am as anti-nazi as it gets and i do n't feel like i am being adressed by it even if someone tries to insult me personally . 
  what bothers me about it is the thoughtlessness of the people who are making these comments . 
  it 's literally part of the comment section of every single posting about germany that gets somewhat popular but at the same time almost noone is aware of this fact . 
  that somehow does n't fly with any other circlejerk on reddit without it getting called out for being stupid , repetitive or unoriginal . 
  i know i ca n't change that but it bothers me somehow . 
  when i came to this thread 14 hours ago 10 out of 14 comments were about hiler and aryans and i just could n't keep this observation for myself and had to point it out in a comment for once . 
  i will stop talking about it now , 
  was being german . 
  went right over my head . 
  that 's your right . 
  feel free to be offended as much as it suits you . 
  i do n't . 
  this is a completly levelheaded and sober conversation . 
  why do you try to ridicule it by calling it whining ? 
  the topic is intersting and worthy of a discussion in my humble opinion as long as someone else is interested in discussing it with me i do n't see a reason why it should be ignored . 
  i do n't think that `` just a dumb ( but popular ) joke '' is the right definition for this either . 
  i 'm also not talking about a single comment that i am responding to , no idea how you came up with that . 
  what i am talking about are these kind of threads : * [ this one is about a funny gardenhose ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/21b3ob/walking_through_my_local_electronic_store_i_found/cgbckmc ) the second comment starts talking about world war ii . 
  `` blitzkrieg bitch '' has almost 1000 upvotes , the mentions of hitler are too many to count them quickly . 
  * [ this one is a funny picture of a german soccer supporter ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/27yp85/dutch_fans_are_watching_a_game_against_germany_on/ci5p7m4 ) of course the top comment is in relation to wwii and has almost 3000 upvotes , the second one is talking about d\u00f6nitz , has 1500 upvotes and got gilded . 
  * [ this guy posts a picture of a hole in his patio ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/1vixup/mysterious_32ft_deep_hole_in_the_middle_of_a/cesp8yi ) in the comments the discussion starts about jews ( 172 upvotes ) and people post nazi gifs . 
  * [ this one is about a german guy talking about faith with an atheist ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1snphu/american_atheists_president_wtf_meme_guy_versus/cdziflz ) `` if a german guy like that starting asking me how devout of a jew i was , i 'd start running for the hills ! '', 
  197 upvotes -- these are just some random examples but this happens in every single thread about a german topic that gets a certain amount of exposure . 
  how can this not be considered a circlejerk ? 
  do comments have to be upvoted to be considered a circlejerk ? 
  maybe i used the wrong name for it then but i honestly do n't know a better fitting one . 
  by the way , these kind of comments getting downvoted is rather the exception . 
  i really hope this `` war on everything '' rhetoric does n't catch on here in europe . 
  indeed . 
  i think most people are just not aware of how prevalent and repetitive it is . 
  there is literally no escape from it on the english speaking parts of the internet but because germans do n't tend to be offended , butthurt or complaining about it there is zero awareness and no second thoughts . 
  i 'm not offended by it and i know that the majority of these comments are not motivated by actual hate . 
  it 's just impossible for me to not be aware of it and because i 'm sure most people are not i wanted to point it out . 
  no hard feelings though , just a slight disappointement . 
  waldeinsamkeit is a bullshit word that gets repeated in these listings over and over but no german speaker has ever used it . 
  it should be replaced by a different compound word that is awesome and unique on several levels but never gets mentioned : ** \u00dcberholprestige ** !, 
  it 's a compound word made up of two languages , practical use of it is only ever relevant in regards to the autobahn and there are real instances when people use it . 
  and some americans really think they are at the receiving end of the worst circlejerks here on reddit . 
  the wwii references to comment ratio in this thread is ridiculous to be honest . 
   their refusal to go with the us strategy in afghanistan except that we did n't refuse it but take part in it for almost a decade now . 
   the reasons why germany has been spied upon are quite simple ... germany has had closer trade ties to iran ( lower down on the agenda these days but still big ) than might be considered a good thing and agreements with gazprom ref nordstream did a good job of screwing over swedish energy security . 
  germany 's exports to iran stay at around [ $ 3 billion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany%e2%80%93iran_relations#current_relations ) per year . 
  that 's [ less than 0.5 % of our exports and less than 0.2 % of our gdp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_germany ) . 
  gazprom is a single company where the second biggest shareholder is an american bank . 
  funny enough the english wikipedia article keeps quiet about that but [ the german one informs about this detail ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazprom#eigent.c3.bcmerstruktur ) . 
  according to [ a 2012 survey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany%e2%80%93iran_relations#polls ) , 6 % of germans view iran favorably compared to 91 % which view it unfavorably and 96 % of germans oppose iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons . 
  are these really supposed to be the reasons why germany is `` less trustworthy '' and so heavily spied upon ? 
  that does n't convince me one bit . 
  there are definitely other factors at play and they have nothing to do with trust . 
  we are guilty of the same but i will change that and link back to you guys soon . 
  edit : done . 
  why not ? 
  what 's the downside ? 
   you either do selective removal of threads that violate that rule or do n't remove any threads that break it i can honestly say that i remove every submission with an editoralized headline that comes to my attention and the topic of it plays absolutely no role in that decision . 
  it 's of course still possible that such a submission slips through because of the sheer amount of postings but i did and would never approve even one of them because of a personal agenda .
