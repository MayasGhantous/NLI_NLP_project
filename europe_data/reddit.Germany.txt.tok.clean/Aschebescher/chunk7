   it was because of my turkish name a background and even my german friends said so . 
  this is sadly true and there are even several studies which have proven this . 
  i think the main problem is that the name of a person gets interpreted as a strong identifier of culture . 
  if one does n't know someone personally like it is the case when reading a job application for example a foreign sounding name leaves uncertainty about the cultural background . 
  i 'm not saying this is right but that 's how i imagine it when trying to understand the situation . 
  the behaviour of some should n't be the measure on how to treat all , though . 
  you are right , i worded that a bit mistakable . 
  in case anyone misunderstood it : i wanted to address / u/whatdayistacotuesday with my comment and only replied to / u/libdependancyhell 's because he provided the quote that i reacted to . 
  yes i know . 
  i posted it here because / u/libdependancyhell provided the context with the quote not because i blame him for anything . 
   you germans are completely incapable of processing any criticism . 
  there are really a lot of stereoytpes about germans going around and i 'm the first one to admit that many of them bear some truth . 
  this claim right here is absolutely ridiculous , though . 
  if there is one thing germans can handle it 's criticism and being made fun off . 
  we are basically growing up with the awarenes that our country fucked up several times in the past and that a lot of criticism is justified . 
  i have never seen a german being butthurt here on reddit if someone else criticizes our country and i have never once seen a german redditor complainig about an `` anti germany circlejerk '' when the anne frankly i did nazi that coming comments are being made . 
  and these comments are made in every fucking thread about germany that draws a certain amount of attention , no matter how unrelated the topic . 
  so please , continue to spread that we do n't have a sense of humor or one of the other 50 stereotypes that have at least some truth to it but stop claiming that we ca n't bear criticism , because that 's not true . 
   saying that it 's because it serves their own interest is almost meaningless . 
  i pointed this out as a direct response to mshotts ' comment and i do n't think this detail is meaningless . 
   but what are those interests ? 
  sustaining a democratic world order ? 
  a stable europe ? 
  keeping russia at bay ? 
  the reasons are manifold i think . 
  sending troops to poland is probably done to keep russia at bay , the bases in germany are a bridgehead to the middle east and the troops in korea are to sustain democracy . 
  it does n't benefit the average taxpayer but certain people in power are clearly benefiting from it , otherwise these payments would n't happen . 
  as one of your politicians said :  [ america has no permanent friends or enemies , only interests . 
  ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/henry_kissinger#1980s ), 
  i 'm not generally opposed to the us having military bases in europe but i also do n't think they do it out of altruism but because it serves their own interests . 
   so the roma are a special case and it is not like racism because they literally behave differently from every other racial or ethnic group . 
  claiming that all members of a certain group of people posses the same characteristics is the textbook example of racism . 
  it 's literally the definition of it . 
  i 'm not disagreeing . 
  what i wanted to say is that it would have happened with any other title as well . 
  it happens in ** every ** thread about germany that gets somewhat active , no matter how unrelated . 
  you are a liar . 
  we are aware of this and actually working on some important changes that will be implemented in the very near future and hopefully make this place welcoming and enjoyable again . 
  is this supposed to be a novelty account ? 
  did nobody plug / r/schland yet ? 
  probably a very edgy advertising agency . 
  a very stupid and shortsighted attempt to gain votes from the spd but a great present for all fearmongers and also the british yellow press . 
  prepare for the nazi comaprisons , the fourth reich is near . 
  there is already a very clear [ definition of hate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatred ) . 
   hatred ( or hate ) is a deep and ** emotional ** extreme dislike that can be directed against individuals , entities , objects , or ideas . 
  hatred is often associated with ** feelings ** of anger and a disposition towards hostility . 
  hate is an emotion and never rational . 
  now i do \\ m /, 
  that 's my main problem with conservative people and conservatism in general . 
  just trying to prevent change and progress is not only boring , it 's also empty . 
  right now they get outraged about a bearded woman because that 's new and they are n't accustomed to it . 
  as soon as they got used to it and bearded women are seen as acceptable they will oppose the next thing they are unfamiliar with . 
  conservatives never cared about the beatles or black jazz musicians in principal , they were just afraid of it just like they are now afraid of conchita wurst . 
   you may think the immigrants will be motivated to live the same life you do , but maybe they are more impressed by 50 cent ? 
  or maybe they are even more motivated . 
  this is a friendly reminder of reddiquette for you , / u/kohalikpagan . 
  it says :  please do n't be ( intentionally ) rude at all . 
  by choosing not to be rude , you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us .

  oh , i totally missed that . 
  germany has won two times so the map is already proven to be flawed . 
  okay , sorry . 
   governments/politicians are always criticizing or praising each other . 
  right , but at that time it was very , very personal . 
  i only mentioned this to point out that your claim americans do n't aggressively criticize or mock people for being foreign is too broad of a generalization and not true . 
  in my opinion this always depends on the individual , his education and social background . 
  some people are just insensitive assholes who mock others for whatever reason seems fir and some are n't . 
   many americans are more politically correct about nationality than europeans tend to be . 
  in the us , it is not considered normal or polite to aggressively criticize or mock people for being foreign . 
  this is far too generalized to be true . 
  just a few years ago your goverment openly ridiculed germany and especially france for not following orders . 
  i do n't think that ever happened the other way around . 
  exactly this time was also the beginning when the tensions between the people of the continents started to rise . 
  it 's all fun and games when people have different opinions on food , sports and music but when the disagreement suddenly is about secret prisons and torture people tend to get emotional . 
  and this time with an even bigger beard . 
   what do you mean ? 
  i mean this whole chain of events is so absurd that only life itself can write such a story . 
  you ca n't make that up . 
  they surrendered after losing more than 350,000 soldiers in a few weeks . 
  that 's more than the us lost in the whole war fighting on two fronts . 
  surrendering was the only rational option they had in that situation . 
  i think this `` stereotype '' was made popular in a southpark episode . 
   some german porn companies specialized in fetish stuff like that in the 70s but mostly for export that 's spot on and exactly what happened . 
  in contrast to many other countries it was legal to produce this kind of porn in germany and one company exported their movies all over the world . 
  now the people who ordered it are accusing us of being into it . 
  [ `` gesichtswurst '' ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=gesichtswurst&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=93&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u ) really exists in germany and is mostly made for kids . 
  mostly rifles and other infantry weapons to arm reservists and maybe even parts of the population in case of an invasion . 
  no , i mean when it 's in copenhagen like now everyone has to sing in danish . 
  all songs should be in the language of the host country , that would be hilarious and bring variety . 
  the bearded lady is the hero eurovision needs and deserves . 
  i do n't own any rights to this and as long as / r/europe has a thread to discuss it everything is fine . 
  maybe you could edit your post and include some more helpful information , though . 
  a link to the webstream for example . 
  that only happens after 24 hours . 
  if i start an official thread now it will only create confusion i think . 
  i had planned to create an `` official eurovision song contest 2014 thread '' one hour before the show begins like i did in [ 2012 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/u6b2e/official_eurovision_thread/ ) and in [ 2013 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1el4dl/official_eurovision_song_contest_2013_thread/ ) . 
  with this thread here already quite active i 'm not sure if that 's still a good idea . 
  there are many movies with completly different storylines and concepts as well but those that turn out to be exceptionally good movies all follow a certain pattern : * about a dark part of german history ? 
  check . 
  * follows the historic facts very closely with very few fiction ?
