  * depressing atmosphere ? 
  check . 
  * some or all of the main protagonists die or get killed ? 
  check . 
  popular examples of this are : * das leben der anderen ( the lives of others ) * der untergang ( downfall ) * das boot * sophie scholl and probably a few more . 
  there is a great movie about the geschwister scholl called [ sophie scholl : the final days ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426578/ ) . 
  you can watch the [ trailer here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm5a4etw_io ) and i just found out you can watch it completly on youtube : * http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plf49b18a402c16d3d like all great german movies it is really depressing and everyone dies at the end . 
  it 's probably not for everyone . 
  i must admit that the recent developements completly changed my view on this topic . 
  i would be in favor of it now . 
  this comment is so fucking stupid it 's almost a work of art . 
  almost . 
   there is n't a country in the world where this is acceptable . 
   apparently in germany , judging from the outcry . 
  stealing other people 's shit is n't acceptable in germany as well . 
  the reason why people are outraged is that we like to grant criminals a second chance in life , especially if they are young and the crime was non-violent and only directed at replacable objects . 
  i totally forgot about that , thanks for bringing back the memories . 
  the crazy thing is that it was [ the thread with the most comments in this subreddit ever ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1el4dl/official_eurovision_song_contest_2013_thread/ ) and every single parent comment showed up in my inbox . 
  i plan on doing a thread again . 
  kreuzschlitzschraubendreher would be the better version , though .

  they should patrol a hall of mirrors for maximum success . 
  the swedes have trust in everyone and the greeks only trust themselves . 
  good , that 's somewhat reassuring . 
   what really hurts is germany :( i wanted to think they would bark back at russia but there to scared to . 
  the problem is that if you bark at someone you have to back it up somehow to not make a fool out of yourself and germany does n't have anything to back it up . 
  we have economic power and we are barking economically , because if shit hits the fan we can back it up . 
  we also have an army that is capable of defending us , and in case we got attacked i am 100 % sure the german army would defend poland with all it has to offer . 
  what germany does n't have is an army that could threaten russia on it 's own territory in any meaningful way . 
  if we started barking at them they would call our bluff and we would be the laughing stock of the entire world . 
  how did the russian public react to this , are there any infos about this ? 
  this warning was in referrence to your habit to call people names and tell them to die in every other comment .

  now that you are aware of this guideline you are expected to follow it , no exceptions and no excuses . 
  is the whole world going crazy ? 
  would you mind crossposting this to / r/europics ? 
   what 's sad is that they cite changing demographics as a boost to his chances . 
  what does that imply ? 
  that immigrants immediately vote for the guy that looks like them without even looking into his politics ? 
  people are not very smart when it comes to elect their leaders and this is probably a phenomenon that can be seen in all demographics , not just immigrants . 
  i would n't be surprised if angela merkel has the majority vote of women in germany and obama has the majority vote of black americans . 
  i was contemplating that right after i wrote my comment . 
  it 's probably a publicity stunt . 
  what did they expect ? 
  i like the word '' \u00dcberholprestige '' because it is very german on two different levels . 
  first it is a compound word , one part of it even fench , which is considered typically german . 
  and secondly it describes a characteristic that does n't matter anywhere else on the planet . 
   the us and russia ( ussr previously ) were fine with avoiding each other when it comes to direct conflict for almost 70 years . 
  why would they break that situation for ukraine ? 
  i know this is a bold theory but what if it never was about ukraine or a new sowjet union in the first place ? 
  ukraine had a shitty dictator just like russia has right now but the people there actually stood up and protested him out of office and out of the country . 
  what if putin just was afraid the people in russia could learn from this and start their own revolution against him ? 
  after all the whole aggression started right at the moment the ukrainen dictator was forced to flee the country . 
  it makes far more sense to me that putin is risking all this because of his ego and for his personal benefit than for his people and a few square kilometres of land . 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  i have never seen a trend anywhere on reddit where germans downvote articles critical of their goverment and this post has a 84 % approval rating right now . 
  how rude . 
  i had a few beers already and if that 's what you got out of my comment i should probably stop commenting for a while . 
  yes , i do . 
  it seems my comment gets misunderstood because i expressed myself badly . 
  what i wanted to say is this : i agree that a goverment is supposed to take care of the interests of it 's own people but being too egoistical does n't always serve the own interests . 
  it 's like [ prisoner 's dilemma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prisoner's_dilemma ) . 
  if you demand too much for yourself the other `` players '' refuse to cooperate and you shoot yourself in the foot . 
  the same can happen in international politics if you are n't willing to compromise . 
  being maximally ego-centric i n't automatically in the best interest of your own people . 
  humans are social beings , todays world is internationally connected , if you piss off too many people it can and probably will backfire . 
  some people are taking these subreddits far too seriously and i do n't want to disagree with you here . 
  [ there is a small meta subreddit where these kind of comments get collected ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay ) . 
  we also have the mcrib on the standard menu and can order it 365 days a year . 
  for redditors interested in pictures of everything europe there is also / r/europics . 
  does n't the uk have the highest tides on the whole planet ? 
  that would be a great opportunity for tidal plants imho . 
  it 's a never ending source of energy right at the coast . 
  they are n't afraid of speaking out despite already being punished for it . 
  i have nothing but respect for that . 
  but especially in the situation right now very few people have to gain anything from the confrontation . 
  it will hurt the economy of all countries . 
  that 's too absolute for me . 
  i really hope we evolve to be smarter some day . 
  i ca n't believe that we are back to such a stupid and dangerous situation in this day and age . 
  that question could best be answered by donald rumsfeld . 
  well , verdammt . 
  no idea how i fucked it up so badly , looks almost like modern art . 
  the ones who did not get a seat on the flying nazi saucers that flew to the dark side of the moon still live there in neu schwabenland . 
  those living in neu schwabenland for sure . 
  what a ridiculous claim . 
  by the way , the french approach has a lot of unsolved problems as well , otherwise you would n't need to import energy from germany in summertime to protect your nuclear plants from overheating . 
  there are still a lot of problems to solve in all european countries and neither coal nor nuclear power will provide the best solution to these problems . 
   but of course that 's ok with you .
