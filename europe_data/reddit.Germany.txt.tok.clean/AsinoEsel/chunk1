would n't really tag it as nsfl . 
  it 's not like there 's any explicit imagery . 
  but wow , that explosion is way larger than i anticipated ... tragic . 
  ohhhhh so that 's what he meant, 
  amazon prime day ? 
  this is definitely the most reasonable solution . 
  both better for the end consumer and it allows for a competitive and even landscape . 
   and why do we need that letter in the first place ? 
  ( as opposed to `` schei\u00dfe '' ) as for typing it , altgr + shift + \u00df does the job on windows ( given you 're using the german keyboard layout ), 
  taken from the video description :  i just wanted to keep the title as short as possible , so i didn \u00b4 t want to write '' berlin and germany in the years of 1890-1920 '' . 
  therfore , i chose the year 1900 to give the viewer a general idea of about what year the footage he is watching is from . 
  so yes , some scenes are from munich , ( 2 ) although the very most , 98 % or so is indeed berlin footage . 
  your parents gave you 500 $ for christmas ?!, 
  or were n't you allowed to keep it ... ? 
  you think so ? 
  personally it leaves a rather salty taste in my mouth ... could be just me though . 
  [ what 's the matter , danny , you 've never taken a shortcut before ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixzomwaolss ), 
  ... wh . . what ? 
  it was just an innocent little joke comment . 
  nobody is circlejerking anything here . 
  point taken . 
  but that does n't change how i feel about it . 
  it 's still scummy behavior in my eyes : /, 
  well , the problem is that apple is forcing you to go to one of their stores by not sharing the documentation required for performing repairs of their devices . 
  imagine you had to go to your car manufacturer if your car engine broke down , and only your car manufacturer because they are withholding important documentation needed for repairs , just so that you could n't get it repaired at an independent repair shop . 
  once the car company has the monopoly over the repairs of their cars , they drive up the prices as much as they want . 
  can you imagine the public outcry ? 
  well , this is no different from what apple is doing . 
  there is absolutely * no reason * why people should be fine with apple doing this anti-competitive behavior . 
  also , not all repair shops cut corners . 
  and if they have to , it 's usually because they do n't have a choice in the matter due to apple 's policies . 
  i 'm not saying that they should repair the laptop for 2 $ , nobody expects that . 
  but there are repair stores that offer macbook repairs for * far * less , and they have to pay tax and keep their store open as well . 
  [ this guy goes into some detail regarding apple 's forced planned obsolescence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvamnv65_zw ) . 
  ( about 15 minutes in he starts repairing the macbook by the way , the important bit is the first 15 minutes or so ), 
   there is a donkey . 
  having your laptop be repaired at an apple store will most definitely cost you more than buying an entirely new laptop - even if the actual material costs are literally at 2 $ . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
   announced zero tolerance policy for terrorism in front of representatives of all muslim nations . 
  like saudi-arabia ? 
  or congratulating erdogan on abolishing democracy in tukey ? 
  : thinking :, 
  filled with navy seals . 
  i think it 's based off [ this painting ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ed/bb/49/edbb4974f020eeeac4e6d46ec6d6668b.jpg ) . 
  please post an update after people have taken the bait !, 
  haha , that 's actually kinda hilarious .

   he wos a fakking german not a european whatever ze fakk zat even iz . 
  gosh , sometimes i wheally hate my country, 
  more like wincest amirite yeah ok ill stop, 
  flying cars ? 
  fidget spinner cars ? 
  [ hell yea !, 
  that looks pretty cool . 
  i really like the contrast between old and new , it does n't look like too much of a stretch . 
  plus , flying ~ ~ roundabouts ~ ~ runabouts ( dammit ) in the sky would be dope as fuck . 
  that would 've made the flag too complex . 
  better play it safe and easily recognizable . 
  yeah , true true . 
  but hey , at least celsius is easily converted to kelvin . 
  same can not be said about fahrenheit !, 
  the actual fuck , the german query results are virtually all `` is [ country ] in the eu '' . 
  edit : even for the us . 
  except for `` england '' , first result to come up there is `` is england still in the eu '' . 
  lol . 
  we use decimeter every day - but we call them liters . 
  one liter is exactly one cubic decimeter . 
  but m/s is !, 
  i was so expecting a picture of an actual mirror that i almost did n't click the link . 
  thank god you 're not an asshole . 
  til , interesting !, 
  here 's another thing to consider : about 3000 people died in the 9/11 attacks . 
  but you know what ? 
  afterwards , people were so terrified of flying for a while that they drove cars instead , bumping up the number of road accidents significantly . 
  it is assumed that about 1500 people died in car accidents as a direct result of 9/11 . 
  nobody even talks about that . 
  but 1500 people dying in a terrorist attack ?!, 
  i suppose it all boils down to the illusion of control . 
  people are not as frightened of car accidents ( despite cars being as dangerous as they are ) because they feel like * they are in control * . 
  everybody thinks of themselves as an above average driver . 
  `` what ? 
  i would * never * get into an accident . 
  others , sure . 
  but * me * ? '', 
  it 's also the reason planes are so scary to some people . 
  when a plane goes down , there 's nothing you can do about it . 
  either you 're lucky and the plane makes it somehow , or everyone on board dies . 
  frankly , by making terrorist attacks as big of a deal as we do , we are * making them worse as they actually are * , both literally and figuratively . 
  yes , terrorism is bad , horrible even . 
  no question . 
  but we have to ask ourselves - what does the fight against terrorism justify ? 
  does it really justify giving up our freedoms ? 
  i do n't think it is . 
   a 2014 report published in the journal earth 's future found that even a regional war of 100 nuclear detonations would produce 5 teragrams of black soot ( that 's 5,000,000,000 kg ! ), 
  that would rise up to earth 's stratosphere and block sunlight . 
  this would produce a sudden drop in global temperatures that could last longer than 25 years and temporarily destroy much of the earth 's protective ozone layer . 
  this could also cause as much as an 80 % increase in uv radiation on earth 's surface and destroy both land and sea-based ecosystems , potentially leading to global nuclear famine .
