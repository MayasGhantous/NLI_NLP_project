  and jobs ... ) . 
  outside of europe : canada . 
  maybe nz . 
  that seems to be the only places that are comparable in politics ( meaning an actual left leaning party ) without big , disgusting spiders . 
  i 'd also like to live in a lot of other places like japan , south korea or taiwan but i value my free time and the working culture would kill me . 
  you 've never met british tourists in southern europe , have you ? 
  because iceland is n't on the peninsular ( and never has been ) and icelandic is a good chunk different than all the other north germanic languages . 
  it 's like making the netherlands german because a good chunk of the germans pick out a word here and there when they hear dutch . 
  denmark used to be on the peninsular . 
  sk\u00e5ne used to be danish and the swedes there still talk funny . 
  also , swedish , danish and norwegian are largely mutually intelligible . 
  a norwegian might get lucky with icelandic but that 's about it . 
  so you do have no go zones then ? 
  in germany , nobody but people who really know what they 're talking about or extremists talk about that subject openly . 
  funnily enough , it 's the far right that 's pro israel ( because bombing muslims gives you more positive points than being a jew gives you negative points ) and the far left contra-israel . 
  if you want to have a german chicken out of a question , ask them what they think about the israel/palestine conflict . 
  you 'll either hear `` i do n't have an opinion '' or one of those `` well i can see what side x says but also what side y says '' arguments that mean nothing . 
  nope . 
  merkels speech is just not translated so all people see is `` we can do it ! '', 
  and take that as a `` inviting everybody to come '' and just ignore the long passage about how we have achieved an awful lot in the last decades as a society and since we got through that , we can get through this as well . 
  the uk if you only speak english ( considering languages spoken in europe ) . 
  or ireland . 
  i 'm not sure what you 'd do in a visual media course but literature and journalism would require an awfully advanced skill level of the language you 'd have to learn . 
  english speaking countries are a safe bet . 
  now , that does n't mean you ca n't study somewhere else . 
  you might find english courses in other countries ( i doubt you 'd find one in germany , though . 
  bachelors are rarely in english in germany and we 're way too fucking proud of our culture to offer something like literature in english ) . 
  you might be able to learn the language . 
  obviously , as somebody who speaks a few regional languages of india and english , you 've got a much better basis than most of us here . 
  language learning gets easier the more languages you know . 
  you guys are mean . 
  who knows how the media coverage in mozambique is ? 
  we know that the us media is misreporting things but maybe they just do n't care all that much in mozambique and op only really got his info from reddit ? 
  western europe might be the safest place on earth but not the centre of the world . 
  you 're fine . 
  some people already gave you the states . 
  do n't worry about the mean people . 
  there are a few topics that come up here over and over again and this is one of them that gets asked over and over again usually with some kind of agenda . 
  that makes people 's eyes twitch a little . 
  keep in mind that the wealth gap in the us is ridiculous and as an engineer , you 'll benefit from that wealth gap . 
  in germany , it 's not too bad . 
  but of course , you do n't pay people more to do a job that can be replaced by machines than what you 'd pay for said machine . 
  so it 's not like retail workers here are living the dream with 5k per month . 
  so instead , you 'd earn less as an engineer . 
  now , the advantages have already been mentioned . 
  cheap health care , cheap education in case you actually want to stay here and start a family or want to further your education , german cities are a lot saver than american cities , public transport , better working conditions , beer that tastes like more than piss or hops ( american beer ( especially ipas ) is said to have a hoppy after taste . 
  do n't go to cologne if you want beer that does n't taste like piss . 
  come to d\u00fcsseldorf for that . 
  cologne is a silly place anyway ) and chocolate that does n't taste like vomit . 
  keep in mind that this also contributes to a general feeling of security . 
  you probably go through life very differently if you know all that would happen to you if you got hit by a bus right now ( and survive ) and wo n't be able to work ever again is that you might have to shop at aldi and buy the cheap fake nutella ( which is better than the original anyway ) . 
  health care is covered , you 'll still be able to send your children to university if they want to ( we have excellent trade education as well and they are just as valuable as a degree . 
  professionally and in society ) , you 're still able to enjoy your life ( apart from all the suffering because of the accident . 
  a bus to the face is still a bus to the face ) . 
  people usually cite how the us is very high up in the hdi ( human development index ) as a reason for having a great life in the us . 
  and that is absolutely true . 
  the us is on rank 8 below norway , australia , switzerland , denmark , netherlands , germany and ireland . 
  and in the upper ranks , the difference in points is unbelievably small . 
  however , the hdi only says how developed humanity in that country is if everybody would be equal . 
  in the inequality adjusted hdi , the us drops to rank 27 right below poland , a country that has been behind the iron curtain . 
  the us is a country where you ** can ** make it big and you 'll have an awesome life if you do ( and an engineering degree is a good way to achieve that ) . 
  germany is a country where you ca n't make it as big but you 'll have a pleasant life as well if you fail to make it big . 
  and that would hurt you and me ( you as an engineer , me as a computer scientist ) to benefit the population as a whole . 
  the question you have to ask yourself is : is the warm and fuzzy feeling in your belly that you have when you realise that the population as a whole has not much to fear or worry about no matter what worth the pay cut compared to the us . 
  for me , it is . 
  germany ** does ** recognise dual eu citizenship , by the way . 
  usually , we would make you get rid of your uk citizenship but since the uk is still in the eu , we ca n't do that and therefore , you can keep both . 
  i 'd ask the embassy . 
  they can help you with everything . 
  only the cheaper glass cleaner vodka does n't taste like anything . 
  churches in my city started to do service on sunday at noon or even later because nobody would get out of bed that early on a sunday and they 'd have empty churches . 
  i 'm from the city in my state with the largest amount of atheists ( officially . 
  you are registered with your church but a lot of people do n't bother leaving . 
  i did recently and am therefore excommunicated ) . 
  catholics get a lot of shit because they 're the more extreme ones . 
  like , religions in germany are part of a e.v. 
  registered organisation ) and the head of that e.v. 
  of the protestant church said once that he does n't care about gay marriage since that 's political and not a question for religion but for politicians . 
  so , even though his believes might not make him agree with that , he does n't even see it as an issue for his religion and would n't oppose it in politics . 
  however , a catholic priest probably would n't say that . 
  but that is as far as it gets with christian extremism . 
  it 's just generally a lot less than some american churches . 
  it 's a matter of perspective , basically . 
  it 's not a true passive . 
  it works the same way though . 
  in the case of english , you 're essentially abusing the passive voice to put the homework first in the sentence to emphasise it . 
  the verb still takes a subject which defeats the purpose of a passive voice . 
  in german , nouns are marked by cases . 
  so , the noun itself will tell you which role it fulfils . 
  the position in the sentence is largely irrelevant ( disclaimer : like in every germanic language , the german case system is slowly collapsing . 
  so it does n't work all the time ) . 
  for example : der hund bei\u00dft den mann ( the dog bites the man ) . 
  der hund means `` the dog '' and is in the nominative case which is the subject of the sentence . 
  `` the man '' in german is `` der mann '' in the nominative ( the article also makes the gender . 
  both nouns are masculine ) but in this case , it 's in the accusative ( so the article becomes `` den '' and not `` der '' ) which marks the direct object . 
  if you switch the sentence around : den mann bei\u00dft der hund . 
  you can use the same verb form and everything . 
  you just switch the position of the nouns . 
  the case makes it clear what is being said and you can put emphasis on the object easily . 
   is there a linguistic ( rather than political ) difference between dutch low saxon and west low german ?
