  i ca n't imagine a place in d\u00fcsseldorf where i would n't want to go . 
  that 's a population of 600k . 
  not paris big but big . 
  scotland has oil . 
   edit i mean compared to americans . 
  i do realize europeans do enjoy their political systems & history . 
  i do n't get that edit . 
  no , there are n't any no-go zones ... 
  every place has pros and cons . 
  and it 's mostly bollocks that there 's more stuff to do in france or germany than in norway or finland . 
  talking about france , look at how many people talk about the rude parisians . 
  are people in other countries less rude ? 
  as a german , i see no difference between my people and the parisians . 
  polite but formal . 
  but people come with the expectation that the parisians will be polite . 
  so , if they buy a pack of cigarettes and the man behind the counter says `` non anglais '' and just puts the cigarettes on the counter , points at the price tag and then just says `` au revoir '' when they leave , it 's all `` omg such rude french people '' . 
  do the same in germany and people will be like `` oh , that was n't a problem . 
  we just communicated with hand gestures :d '' same for holiday destinations . 
  your holiday is what you make it to be . 
  you will get drunk anywhere . 
  you will have fun anywhere . 
  you will find a lot of history everywhere . 
  helsinki and finland in general are just not known for it . 
  but if you want to visit , do so . 
  take a few books with you ( or a kindle . 
  not even extra weight ! ) . 
  in the worst case , you 've got a relaxing holiday full of reading and explored all the local restaurants and tasted all the vodka . 
  you are all americans ( or english . 
  not sure if the average , badly english speaking german would actually think about americans first ) at first and if you say that you 're not then you 're `` those guys with the deadly spiders '' or `` those other guys that also have weird animals ... 
  i think ... 
  but hobbits ! '', 
  or `` those people north of the americans . 
  what ? 
  some of them speak french ? 
  holy shit did n't know that ... '' at lest on average . 
   moving back you do n't . 
  you move in . 
  nobody cares where your family was from . 
  it just does n't matter to us so it 's not like you 're `` a lost son of the nation returning home '' . 
  immigration is a matter of the nation . 
  not the eu itself ( no matter what the brits tell you ) . 
  so it varies a lot from country to country in terms of difficulty . 
  i do n't think the policies would get any more strict in germany . 
  in fact , we just loosened them for first generation germans so they can get citizenship easier even if they were n't born here and i think also keep their other citizenship . 
  the problem is not really immigration but refugees and even then the counter protests in germany are massive compared to the actual protests against refugees . 
  from what i 've heard , even in sweden people just get fed up with you only speaking english . 
  there was a dude in / r/languagelearning that moved to sweden and learnt swedish but because everybody speaks english to him , he did n't really learn it . 
  after a year or so , his friends just went `` you 've been here long enough . 
  we speak swedish now '' . 
  also , i personally find it very disrespectful if you do n't learn the language of your host country . 
  even if i moved to the netherlands ( they all speak english and around 70 % of them speak german which is my native language ) , i 'd learn dutch . 
  it 's the minimal amount of efford i can invest in showing respect to the country and it 's culture . 
  i might not like ( or dislike depending on who you talk to ) the monarchy . 
  i might not really like cheese . 
  i might not really get into the holidays or integrate in any other way . 
  but the language is a must have . 
  because with the language , all cultural differences seem to become very minor things for me . 
  the language is what makes me forget people are foreigners . 
  the language is the difference between german spiced up and foreigner . 
   1 ) is it possible to live and work in these countries on a visa for a decade plus ? 
  easy if you qualify ( you almost always need english skills )  2 ) how easy is it to obtain citizenship in these countries . 
  get the visa first . 
  germany , for example , forbids dual citizenship so you 'd have to drop your canadian one . 
  you can think about that once you 've got your permanent visa which is already hard enough  3 ) is there much work for electricians in these countries , as well as esl teachers . 
  depends highly on the country . 
  you will not find work as an electrician in germany . 
  we 've still got the guild system in place . 
  an employer would have the choice between you and a dude who did a 3 years apprentice ship right after high school just for the purpose of developing his craft ** not ** to just work in a particular company . 
  there are exams and the employers know what to expect from somebody with a passed exam from the guilds ( they 're not called handelskammer / handwerkskammer depending on what you do but they 're essentially guilds for industry jobs or craftsmanship jobs ) . 
  you are just a lot of questions nobody can really answer . 
  in terms of esl teachers , i feel like we in germany want educated people . 
  a native speaker does n't qualify . 
  but that might be very different in private schools . 
   4 ) do these jobs have comparable income in europe ? 
  combined income of approx ( $ 110,000 cad - $ 120,000 cad ) annually . 
  no idea  any other information you deem relevant would be very welcome !!, 
  thank you in advance  get more specific please . 
  what ** exactly ** did you do career wise ? 
  could you get citizenship through your grandparents ? 
  how well does your girl friend speaks french ? 
  i 've only heard irish from irish people for the irish language ( gaeilge ) . 
  however , i have heard people refering to scottish gaelic ( g\u00e0idhlig ) as `` gaelic '' but those are not the same languages . 
  they split around the same time the scandinavian languages split into danish , norwegian and swedish . 
  the average german sees those cities as polish ( or russian ) territory and does n't give a damn about prussia . 
  it 's the price we paid for losing ww2 . 
  seeing those cities as german is a very radical view and usually only seen amongst neo-nazis or at least very far right leaning people . 
  the only thing my grandmother had to say about that topic when she visited kaliningrad and other parts of western russia was that she finds it sad that those places have been purged from anything german . 
  not because she thinks that it 's `` rightfully german '' but because it 's sad that the history of those places got lost to some extend . 
  and i would n't even know how to pronounce the polish names of breslau and danzig and krakau . 
  but those are not the german names anyway . 
  we also call france frankreich and norway or norwegen ( norge in norwegian , by the way ) . 
  in fact , using local names is something i 've only seen on reddit and it looks weird every single time . 
  especially in language learning subreddits . 
  it 's not * fran\u00e7aise * and certainly not * francaise * in english . 
  it 's * french * . 
  it 's also not * deutsch * or * norsk * or * nihongo * but * german * , * norwegian * or * japanese * . 
  and if i have to read * gealic * instead of * irish * once more i 'm gon na flip . 
  that 's not how you spell jude . 
  since your husband was born in bosnia ( at least i 've understood it that way ) , he ca n't get citizenship . 
  and i think even if he were born in germany , it 's still not easy .
