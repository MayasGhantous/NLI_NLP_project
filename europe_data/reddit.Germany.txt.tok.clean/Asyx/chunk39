  that 's pretty much where the apathy comes from . 
  most people are not affected by it and it 's not like the situation is objectively bad . 
  it 's just not perfect . 
  so people vote for the cdu because on issues that they see as important , the cdu fits them better . 
  it has very little to do with refugees and everything with the centrist approach the spd showed since their agenda 2010 bullshit . 
  with schulz , it seems like the spd is back on track . 
  and people are tired of the conservatives . 
  that 's quebec saving your ass . 
  also , the studentenwerke need more people . 
  i remember studentenwerke just shutting down because they get drowned by paperwork when you have to reapply for baf\u00f6g . 
  i think that was in berlin . 
   when a government infamous for political assassinations south america in the 70s/80s ? 
  one could argue that the wars in the middle east are a big political game to the us now . 
   has been in the news for tourist kidnappings the us has been in the news for kidnapping foreign citizens in their own countries and torturing them for no reason . 
  i actually have to put in everything ever now and then . 
  number and cvc . 
  it 's an amazon issued german visa mostly used on amazon.de . 
  the risk is so small in comparison to endanger herd immunity that it can be ignored . 
  also , at least in germany , children still have rights . 
  they 're not the property of the parents . 
  you have the right to go to school and if your parent decide that the child does n't exercise that right , the government will step in . 
  and it 's the same with vaccines . 
  sure , the parents are the legal representatives of children until they can make decisions on their own but not without limits . 
  oh is that the guy in new york that 's just sitting their with his fancy microscope ranting about apple ? 
  that dude is fun . 
  didnt even mean to watch him and then spent three hours watching his videos . 
  bruh ... 
  basically , if you run as an mp , you take part in an event in your constituency during election . 
  including joke candidates . 
  there 's this dude that calls himself lord buckethead and he was running next to may . 
  john oliver picked up on him and now everybody knows about him and he has become a meme . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  france , germany and the uk are the most important countries in europe . 
  the uk is having elections . 
  the goal of terrorists is to destabilise societies so that they can pitch the native population against muslims living in those countries so that they can recruit them more easily and bolster their ranks . 
  this has been said for years , this is something everybody with half a brain knows . 
  if you were getting your head out of your ass , you 'd know that as well . 
  stop deleting your comments / u/freetibetfreeeurope he just said `` sweden  '' my response : heated political climate as well . 
  isis generally has three different approaches to attacks . 
  using their people which is usually something that you find in territory they control . 
  supporting people in other countries with money and access to guns which is what we saw in paris claiming being behind every radical that pulls some shit even if they were not involved directly . 
  the stockholm attack was the third kind of attack . 
  of course the people planing things like this are not going to cross a border for their plans . 
  apparently not . 
  still less dangerous than us cities . 
  then start listening . 
  this suit is the shit . 
  probably the best thing obama has ever worn . 
  the csu is not on the ballots in nrw . 
  i 'd sell berlin to poland for 50 $ . 
   which they did , so there 's no issue . 
  yes . 
  once . 
  scotland still depends on the uk parliament 's mood to get an indyref . 
   may is correct not to give them another referendum otherwise the snp would just keep pushing them until it went the way they wanted . 
  that 's literally what i 'm talking about ... may should n't be able to prevent the scottish parliament from holding a referendum . 
  my point was ** literally ** that the uk is nothing like the eu . 
  the british government can literally prevent scotland from governing itself whilst every politician in brussels can do whatever the fuck they want and the uk does n't need to give a single damn if they want to hold an independent referendum . 
  literally my fucking point ...  nobody can stop any government doing something stupid . 
  actually , german states can easily veto the federal diet through the federal council . 
  that way smaller states have a way to influence the federal government instead of simply being governed . 
  and so do smaller eu member states , by the way . 
  ok , wales has a parliament . 
  that 's good to know . 
  all states were independent at some point . 
  the current borders just do n't reflect that anymore . 
  germany actually has the federal council which gives states a way to veto the federal government . 
  bremen , with a population of 600k , has 3 votes whilst nrw , with a population of 18 million , has 6 votes . 
  so smaller states have a way to make their interest at least count even though they do n't have the population to vote against the federal government . 
  apart from that only saarland has the right to become french with a referendum . 
  even though smaller states have a way to protect their interest in the federation ( and therefore are not as lost as scottish politicians seem to explain the situation they find themselves in ) , i 'd still like to see a way for them to leave the federation . 
  so yeah . 
  i do even though i find our system much fairer to smaller states ( i do live in nrw , by the way . 
  so this system is a direct disadvantage to my state ) and therefore less stockholm syndrom-ish . 
  but the fact that the constitution generally has no way of letting states go is bugging me . 
  scotland and ni have the right to leave ** if the british government agrees to a referendum ** . 
  that was a huge topic in / r/uk after brexit because there were rumours that may will not allow a second indyref no matter what . 
  as far as i know , scotland would also not have any legal way to stop the british government from doing something stupid . 
  in comparison , in germany , the federal council gives smaller states a larger voice so if the federal government does something that benefits urban areas more than rural areas , tiny saarland has a much bigger vote in the federal council than northrhine westphalia and the council could then veto the federal diet . 
  there is , as far as i 'm aware , nothing like that in the uk . 
  also , does wales even have a parliament ? 
   does n't change the fact that scotland , wales and ni do not have the right to leave the union ** on their own terms ** if scotland right now decided to have a referendum and the british government decided that they will ignore the outcome , the scottish government ca n't do shit about it . 
   no ones inferior but we make decisions as the uk , not individual nations , ** so england being as big as it is population-wise holds larger sway ** . 
  also very unusual and not very eu like . 
  england might not be the de jure superior member but it is de facto through the population difference . 
  in the eu , if estonia vetos something then it literally does n't matter what the rest of the eu thinks . 
  the english part of the british government could potentially ignore the scottish part . 
  maybe calling the uk a union of the stockholm syndrom was a bit harsh but the point still stands . 
  there 's a fundamental difference in the relationship between the eu member states and the members of the uk . 
  does n't change the fact that scotland , wales and ni do not have the right to leave the union on their own terms the way the uk now has the right to leave the eu . 
  elected officials or royalty might have gone through the proper legal channels with scotland and ni but there are clearly inferior members in the uk . 
  edit : stop deleting your comments / u/nationaldenbt my replay :  you must have missed that huge referendum we had where scotland decided to stay with us . 
  and you must have missed that plan for a second referendum that the national government has to agree to . 
   scotland is not inferior either , they have the highest public spending per capita in the uk thanks to the barnett formula where we literally just give them extra money . 
  pretty standard in every union . 
  be it an equal one or not . 
   that 's why they have stuff like free university while the rest of the uk does not . 
  if you stopped electing the tories , you 'd probably have that in england as well . 
  anyway , scottish politicians have been complaining about not being on equal terms with the national government for as long as i give a damn about uk politics . 
  you are a country that works like a federation but pretends to be special .
