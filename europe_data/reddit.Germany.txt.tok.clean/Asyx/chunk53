  i mean , who else is there ? 
  we germans do n't care that they beat us in the world cup once . 
  swedish has a pitch accent . 
  except in finland . 
  it 's like swiss german and german . 
  swiss german is n't that different grammatically but the accent is such a mess for german ears ( at least germans from the north ) that you do n't understand a bloody thing ... 
  so i suppose the accents are just too different . 
  i met a jew once in germany . 
  a dude at my school . 
  pretty nice guy . 
  pavel is his name . 
  brilliant hon player back then . 
  anyway , pavel is russian and came here when he was 6 or something so he still has an accent . 
  he was standing there and fiddling around with coins in his pocket . 
  i look at him and said `` mate , what are you doing ? '', 
  he looks me in the eyes and says with his russian accent `` jewish fapping '' . 
  i did n't know if i was supposed to be shocked because i 'm german or if i were allowed to laugh :(, 
  it 's almost like swedish is just norwegian written like german ... 
   god jul p\u00e5 begge kakene that means `` merry christmas on both cakes '' by the way . 
  damn am i feeling proud that i did n't need a dictionary for that one . 
  mach ` ma chef !, 
  sn\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6\u00e6p !, 
  fun fact , the only reason why swedes use \u00e4 and \u00f6 instead of \u00e6 and \u00f8 is basically `` fuck you , denmark ! '', 
  i 'm surprised that this was enough once . 
  well , it does n't make much sense to say * ca n't * like a brit and * privacy * like an american but then write * trousers * and * sidewalk * . 
  since i was much more used to rp for listening and speaking ( at least as close as you can get in school ) and most british accents are non-rhotic and therefore drop the r after a vowel , i also would n't have to deal with as much weird r sounds . 
  so the american stuff seemed to be more like `` dirty spots '' on my otherwise british english education . 
  so i got rid of the american stuff . 
  damn those yanks !, 
  no idea how west flemish sounds but frisian is an awfully old language . 
  there is no doubt that frisian is not just dutch or low german ( though east frisian is a lot closer to low german than west frisian to dutch if i remember correctly ) . 
  you said that they should rather learn english than catalan or whatever other language spoken in spain . 
  and it probably has nothing to do with pride but culture . 
  austria is pretty high up there ... 
  everything is more pleasant than dutch ( except swiss german ) . 
  i 'd rather not speak english than not speaking the language of the region i live in ... 
  touch\u00e9 ... 
  i learnt british english in school . 
  the problem is that most of the english media we see is american . 
  i 'm 21 and in nrw . 
  i made a real effort to get rid of that american nonsense when i speak english . 
  also , i 've noticed that the people that have lived in germany and did n't speak german were in general less happy here . 
  so let then bath in their ignorance . 
  they 'll probably leave anyway . 
  frisian is a language . 
  not a dutch dialect . 
  ok ok i 'll delete my comments :(, 
  the spaniard have that cute little lisp going on . 
  an awful lot of language in spain . 
  colonial power . 
  monarchy . 
  mallorca is the island of shame for us germans . 
  that 's where we send all the people no other country would take as tourists . 
  there is something like an elective monarchy . 
  what is the biggest / most neutral newspaper in norway ? 
  and do they have a website ? 
  slow news week ? 
  write down what you know . 
  if you 're afraid that your native language might die out , save as much as possible on paper . 
  you 've got the possibility to do that . 
  some tribes in asia or africa ca n't . 
  some of those languages are already lost . 
  we 've got a crepe vendor in d\u00fcsseldorf , germany . 
  it 's at the end of the bolckerstra\u00dfe which is pretty nice . 
  there are basically only pubs on that street . 
  you get out of the u-bahn ( metro ) , get a cheese burger at mcdonalds , drink your way through the bolckerstra\u00dfe , get a crepe at the end ( on the other side of the street is a shop where you can buy smoking supplies , by the way ) , take a drink at the irish pub and then take a taxi home . 
  well , the font is a bit small so it looks like b\u00e4r simply because nobody would expect \u00e5 in germany . 
  i 'd use \u00e5 , though . 
  like i said , the orthography is n't standardised and it does n't make a difference for people that ca n't speak low german and people that speak low german have probably seen it somewhere but might not use it . 
  but then again , there are so many dialects in low german that you might as well find people that say boor instead of baar or b\u00e5r so you ca n't satisfy everybody . 
  just leave it . 
  you could make the font a bit bigger but then it looks like low german were as common as high german in germany which is simply not the case . 
  i did a bit of research and the low german word for `` b\u00e4r '' is either `` baar '' or `` boor '' ( low and high german capitalise nouns , by the way ) . 
  the `` aa '' is actually a way to write the \u00e5 if \u00e5 is not available in danish . 
  orthography is not standardised in low german , though . 
  i found a small article in low german ( which is a pain to read , by the way , and i was only able to read it because i know some of the words from my local high german dialect and because the text itself was really simple . 
  so i might have misunderstood it ) which said that there is the `` dark a '' or `` d\u00fcsteres a '' in low german which is \u00e5 in danish . 
  since there is no \u00e5 in german , it might not be used very often but i have n't found a source for that . 
  i 'd say that \u00e5 is correct for baar . 
  low german is mostly spoken in schleswig-holstein anyway and that 's so close to denmark and has such a big danish minority that i 'm not sure if anybody who speaks low german would not know the letter \u00e5 . 
  ~ ~ it 's b\u00e4r . ~ ~ ~ ~ maybe just a typo . 
  i 'm sure there is no \u00e5 in low german . 
  ~ ~ no , it 's not :( if \u00e5 represents aa in low german as it does in danish ( and it seems to do just that ) , b\u00e5r is right . 
  to be fair , i 've now done something like 10 hours norwegian studying and even after that short amount of time the first thing that pops into my mind when i hear danish is `` man , you should see a doctor with that '' ... feel kind of bad about that but i guess that 's just how it works if you study a nordic language ... 
  what ? 
  do they really ? 
  americans committed treason which is the reason why you now have a us flair and not something with a fancy union flag and why you 've got dead men in your money and not the queen . 
  you , as an america , should know best that treason in the eyes of the government is not always treason if you 're concerned about the people . 
  it 's really hard to get into the us . 
  even if you already have a job , you still need to play the visa lottery . 
  australia requires you to have at least some kind of money worth mentioning as far as i remember which is not easy if the economy is shit since you might had to live off saving for some times . 
  no idea about nz canada is a bit easier since not as many people as it 's the case with the us want to go to canada . 
  so if you are a skilled worker , you do n't have to play the visa lottery . 
  but being a skilled worker is not that easy either . 
  what about the people without university degree ? 
  so eu is an awful lot easier compared to english speaking countries . 
  it 's not much better everything else , i think . 
  ca n't tell you if they switched to english but learning a germanic language for a romance language native is pretty hard to even if they have switched , the majority of the country not necessarily speaks english . 
  and where would you go then anyway ? 
  the uk which is so overrun by people from everywhere else anyway or to ireland which is in a bad situation as well ?
