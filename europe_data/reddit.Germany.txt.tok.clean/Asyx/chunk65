  it 's the bloody mountain air . 
  that 's not correct , by the way . 
  it sounds weird . 
  `` sie '' in the formal meaning of `` du '' is always capitalised . 
  though , you say `` du '' on the internet . 
  `` sprache '' means `` language '' , `` sprechen '' means `` to speak , to talk '' . 
  `` im '' means `` in dem '' . 
  you either speak german ( ich spreche deutsch ) , you speak `` on german '' ( ich spreche mit dir auf deutsch ) or something means something in the german ( language ) ( `` car '' means `` das auto '' im deutschen ) . 
  `` ich bin lernt '' i suppose you wanted to say `` i 'm learning '' . 
  there is no continuous form . 
  you say `` i learn right now '' but it 's not obvious what you 're learning since `` lernen '' also means `` to study ( for an exam ) '' . 
  so you 'd say that you 're learning german right now `` ich lerne gerade deutsch '' . 
  ich lerne du lernst er/sie/es lernt wir lernen ihr lernt sie lernen `` mein deutsch ist schlecht '' `` deutsch '' is a noun here so it 's capitalised . 
  i hope that does n't look like i want to piss you off . 
  i know that you english speaking people have a problem with correcting somebodies language as direct as i do here but that 's the easiest way to get rid of mistakes . 
  then you heard wrong . 
  bavarians might not like the french but the bavarians do n't like anybody who is n't bavarian . 
  maybe they still remember what happened when prussia was a bit bitchy :d, 
  i 've seen that a lot on / r/germany . 
  the first thing somebody suggests if an american is asking about germany ( because of an exchange programme , holiday , immigration ) is that it might look like people do n't like you but they just do n't know you yet . 
  i think on every `` i 'm british and immigrated to germany '' blog is something about almost breaking into tears british people because they thought they fucked up royally because everybody was just telling them straight what 's going on at their work place . 
  i 'm not so sure what you 're actually doing then either ... 
  that 's not necessary if they surrender immediately . 
  we should annex austria . 
  i 'm wondering if that could actually work ... 
  i mean , german states can make international treaties . 
  so why should n't schleswig-holstein be a part of your nordic union . 
  at least loosely since they ca n't leave the federation as far as i know . 
  really . 
  because sunday is quiet . 
  nobody is stressed . 
  everybody is relaxing . 
  it 's awesome if you 're used to it . 
  the french do n't like us ? 
  at least that 's where it belongs again . 
  we do n't hate the french . 
  i just notice that i 've forgotten the `` they 're not less dangerous than right extremists '' . 
  sure , al-qaeda is no match for the lefties . 
  but the right extremists are amateurs as well . 
  so it 's more like `` bad luck '' that those petrol bombs did n't go off . 
  well , there were a bunch of petrol bombs placed by left extremists in berlin next to rail roads a few years ago . 
  i think the raf might be something people know who are from germany or are a bit older . 
  specifically those petrol bombs did n't go off but they could easily kill people if they were . 
  people always laugh at me when i say that the far left is dangerous . 
  just because they fail to kill people , they 're not less dangerous . 
  oh i thought you 'd have sneaked a bit of territory between holland and westphalia which would be very odd indeed . 
  tell me more . 
  if they actually wanted people to stop smoking , they 'd just ban it . 
  it 's more dangerous than many illegal drugs so what 's the point ( i 'm a smoker , by the way , so do n't start with some ridiculous arguments ) ? 
  border control is the matter of the particular member state . 
  transylvania is pretty great , though . 
  i think in 1000 years you can pretty much say everything you want to say and there 's just nothing left to fight about . 
  ah now i get it . 
  i 've got family in france and it 's awkward as hell for me as well . 
  explain ? 
  well , vikings . 
  that 's probably the most important things . 
  they were really angry with the danes and ( i hope i remember that correctly ) had a lot of wars with the danes and norway was mostly the bitch that got handed over to the winner ( i think there 's a satw comic about that but i 'm not so sure ) . 
  the swedes also once invaded parts of germany and there 's still a north german children song about the evil swede but i ca n't remember it . 
  now , the swedes are pacifistic . 
  tpb , pirate party , looks like a penis on the euro coin . 
  so like berlin every 1st may . 
  i think the demographic just became to dump to deal with a long word like `` bildzeitung '' . 
  it 's `` bildzeitung '' and not just `` bild '' and you always use the gender of the last part of a compound noun . 
  zeitung is feminine and so is bildzeitung and `` bild '' is just a short form of `` bildzeitung '' in this case . 
  `` der spiegel '' is n't called `` spiegelzeitung '' but i think the bild was once actually called `` bildzeitung '' . 
  bild is neutal , though , so `` das bild '' would be right if you talk about a picture but it 's `` die bild ( zeitung ) '' and `` zeitung '' is feminine . 
  but low german ( plattdeutsch ) is completely missing even though it has official status in some northern states . 
  do n't worry . 
  my monitor is ... you know ... properly adjusted like the settings graphics designer use so they see their work while working as it would look like on paper and it 's still very , very hard to tell apart . 
  was n't it the same in the uk a year or so ago where the police has shot an armed young man who lived in a poorer district and the family said `` he was armed so the police is not to be blamed . '', 
  but people still rioted and a lot of them just used the opportunity to loot . 
  sure it 's linguistically correct but people take it too serious . 
  and i 'm pretty sure he once said there is no reason why `` girl '' is a neutral noun in german and that is a straight lie . 
  i 'm not so sure about that , though . 
  i have read that specific paragraph a fee month ago . 
  that 's actually bullshit but whatever . 
  give me a passage of the book and i explain it properly to you . 
  german here . 
  i do n't see what you 're talking about . 
  i tried but i do n't . 
  i 've seen a lot of `` mean '' things against german though nothing was actually meant serious . 
  i ca n't even see a slight trance of any kind of racism or xenophobia in the post you initially replied to . 
  also , two other things . 
  firstly , we do n't work against the eu . 
  that 's one party nobody will vote for anyway . 
  we do n't like that we wo n't see our money from the greek again , but that was kind of expected and people want change in the eu on that matter but still see the benefit of the eu . 
  secondly , where are you from ? 
  you do n't seem european . 
  i think frikandellen/frikadeller/frikadellen are some kind of germanic since every germanic countries seems to eat them . 
  except the uk because they got themselves invaded by the french . 
  does the rest of scandinavia eat them ? 
  at some point , iceland just erased a few hundred years of language evolution so it 's closer to old norse and therefore to almost all the old versions of germanic languages . 
  i think we never send professionals . 
  do n't know if that 's a rule or something but we never do . 
  correct . 
  they succeeded . 
  actually , i think i 've read that there are some species that can be homosexual and they also take care of children if , for example , they find one and the parents got killed . 
  and you think they do n't get bullied in school for being a orphan ? 
  sure , it is an argument against gay adoption ( probably the only one ) but it is a minor argument and the fact alone that the child is not rotting in an orphanage until he or she is 18 is way more than enough to justify gay adoptions .
