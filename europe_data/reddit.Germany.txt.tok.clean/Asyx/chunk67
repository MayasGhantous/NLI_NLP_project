  luckily , we have some tourism and the biggest international airport is in d\u00fcsseldorf so we put quite some money into it to not let it look like a big block of concrete . 
  but he apologised after the bombing . 
  the americans throw two atomic bombs on cities full of civilians and you still read `` without us , they would n't be as great of a society as they are today ! '', 
  on reddit . 
  almost everything else bombed by the allies was justified . 
  it was a tough time . 
  mistakes happen . 
  it takes much more balls to apologise for such a mistake than to give the order . 
  and i thought we were late with our pardons of the nazi court rulings in 1999, 
  turing probably deserved it more than anybody . 
  well , i thought moving to the uk at some point would be a good idea . 
  i probably should think about that a bit longer :d, 
  we wo n't . 
  it 's just a way to describe a political union between european countries . 
  we 've gypsy schnitzels and gypsy sauce . 
  i do n't think it 's considered offensive . 
  we also got rid of `` negro heads '' and `` nigger kisses '' ( now known as foam kisses ) because that 's obviously not acceptable . 
  here 's a romanian explaining a thing or two https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgcaf4dnyxo, 
  i do n't know about the english speaking world but in germany , zigeuner is used if you talk about the culture and roma if you talk about the ethnic group . 
  so it 's actually seen as two separate things who happen to overlap somehow . 
  the memorials we built in berlin for the killed sinti and roma are called `` denkmal f\u00fcr die im nationalsozialismus ermordeten sinti und roma in europa '' ( memorial for the in the national socialism murdered sinti and roma in europe ) while the english press always reported something about `` gypsy memorials '' . 
  gypsies are romani . 
  they come from somewhere near india . 
  since gypsies do n't breed with others ( gypsies !, 
  not roma !, 
  it 's a cultural thing and not a racial thing ) , their skin has n't changed much even after 1000 years in europe . 
  it hurts when i think about that piece of shit . 
  i ca n't remember many other threads here about american events . 
  i also said `` it seems like most people ... '' so i never implied that it was anything but anecdotes . 
  you should also know that anything you said can be said about americans as well . 
  i 've got so many responses that were like `` get your shit together , europe '' for no reason than `` the usa does it differently '' . 
  germany has every citizen registered because it makes voting and everything easier . 
  `` oh my gosh literally worse than hitler '' . 
  radical organisations want executions for homosexuals and get arrested for hate speeches . 
  `` oh my god free speech ! '', 
  oh ... and do n't forget the `` you 're german and you 're as bad as the nazis because your family did n't fight the nazis '' comments . 
  i like those a lot !, 
  any time somebody posts stuff like `` til sweden recycles so efficient that they have to import trash for their power plants '' or stuff like that , americans get a shit fit in the comments because apparently any kind of good thing that happens in europe is automatically anti-american . 
  most europeans do n't feel superior . 
  you 're just whiny bitches . 
  europeans get at least as much shit from others for what 's going on or what was going on in their country as americans but we do n't make a fuss about it . 
  also , -7 is not downvoted out of sight in a comment chain where the first comment has +100 . 
  but again , i could n't give a damn if those comments are downvoted because i do n't care what the majority thinks but what specific people said . 
  i do n't understand why you piss around here if europeans are `` so annoying '' to you . 
  if criticism of people because of what they said and who happen to be americans hurts your national pride , why do n't you just go away ? 
  it 's also quite funny that `` most people '' makes you see hypocrisy . 
  i do n't know what 's going on in your mind and i do n't understand why you feel insulted by me having a problem with people celebrating death and certain people that demand killing people as punishment ( which comes up quite often on reddit so that one comment i gave you just happens to be relevant ) especially since i 've never spoken about all americans . 
  but i do n't get what kind of satisfaction you get from pissing around here . 
  this is / r/europe and a thread where the majority agrees on what i 've said . 
  if you ca n't stand those kind of statements , why do n't you just go away ? 
   do you know why assholes keep fucking with our country ? 
  because we 're afraid to heinously punish these assholes . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1cqknp/obama_rejects_the_war_on_terror_by_trying_boston/c9j2rxf  why would n't we kill him ? 
  i do n't understand what is so wrong with killing someone who deserves it or torturing terrorists ? 
  what kind of push over country are you trying to turn america into ? 
  it makes me sick to think people are actually trying to talk smack on bush for doing something that the whole world has done for eternity . 
  torture terrorists , torture all of them http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1cqknp/obama_rejects_the_war_on_terror_by_trying_boston/c9j38bm i got you two . 
  i do n't care that they 're not upvoted . 
  the whole notion of such a comment is ridiculous . 
  obviously they 're not upvoted . 
  unlike you , i do n't like to generalise . 
  if you look at some of the related comments , you 'll see that people also said that they hope that they 'd just shoot the terrorist and stuff like that . 
  are you that pathetic that you 've got to take a throwaway account for that ? 
  i 'm not british so i do n't know exactly what thatcher did but what i 've heard was n't nice . 
  i 've heard thatcher fucked the north of england over from the day she got elected to the day she was n't pm anymore . 
  `` cunt '' seems to be a very precise description in this case . 
  i never said anything about `` you should respect the dead '' because that 's bullshit . 
  just because somebody is dead now , they do n't change . 
  she was apparently a cunt when she was alive and that does n't change after death . 
  i have n't seen pictures of british people celebrating like it 's karneval or something like that . 
  i have n't seen more bloodthirsty brits than i 've seen people that said that they 'd feel kind of bad now . 
  americans in multiple threads demanded blood and torture for the bombers . 
  that 's the difference . 
  nobody said `` i wished she died a horrible slow death '' . 
  the 7th century was actually quite modern in the muslim world . 
  shit went down in the 12th when that crazy muslim decided that mathematics is the work of the devil . 
  who 's that ? 
   i do n't think all deaths are equivalent . 
  i do . 
  at least to the degree that you should n't celebrate the death of somebody else . 
  germany is so diverse as if there was a wall dividing the country at some point ... oh wait !, 
  your understanding of germany is as wrong at it can get . 
  nobody assumes that the us states are the same no matter where you are . 
  but you put way too much value in your `` diversity '' . 
  there is no difference between being french and being american . 
  just because you 've got more space than european countries , you 're not more diverse . 
  the south and the north of a country can be like day and night . 
  take a train 20 minutes to the north of cologne and you get a different dialect , different beer , different local celebrations , different mindsets , different food . 
  where did you live in france ? 
  do you speak french ? 
  what parts of the country did you visit ? 
  that said , your culture is still irrelevant to us and there 's not more need to learn about us states except that there are cultural differences than there is in other countries . 
  your country is called the united states of america and that 's all we care about and have to care about . 
  maybe you should avoid that kind of idiotic language if you want a proper answer . 
  you sounds like the typical european patriot which are rare , uneducated and mostly people you try to avoid . 
  your whole comment reads like `` come at me , europe !, 
  you ca n't handle ` muricas freedom ! '' . 
  do n't be a prick and people will answer you . 
  or karneval . 
  that 's disgusting .
