  germany : 6-10 : primary school . 
  only one of those . 
  marks in 3rd and 4th grade . 
  before that , you only get some kind of review in text form from your teacher . 
  the final mark + the opinion of the teacher in 4th grade decide on what schools you can go to after that . 
  10-16 : secondary schools . 
  4 of those . 
  hauptschule ( basic school ) , realschule ( hard to translate . 
  it 's in the middle . 
  that 's all you need to know ) , gymnasium ( highes level ) . 
  there are minor differences between realschule and gymnasium . 
  i had the final exam in 10th grade from a gymnasium to learn for mine on a realschule . 
  hauptschule is very easy compared to the others . 
  all of them have their own degrees . 
  you can make the realschule degree on a hauptschule if you do 10b ( that 's the 10th grade from a realschule on a hauptschule ) . 
  you can get qualifications for college ( later more about that ) on a realschule if your average mark is 3.0 . 
  gymnasium gives you college qualifications if you just pass . 
  you can fail every class once . 
  if you fail again , you have to go to the school below your current one . 
  no idea what happens if you fail twice on a hauptschule . 
  there 's also a gesamtschule ( gesamt = everything , entirely , entire , something like that . 
  `` die gesamte klasse '' = `` the entire class '' ) which allows you to make every degree on those schools . 
  if you fail , you can just change class . 
  now it gets a bit more complicated . 
  college !, 
  most college degrees are 3 years ( i think the academic one is 2 years now ) . 
  there are 3 basic types of college degrees . 
  fhr , ahr and some weird other thing . 
  fhr means fachhochschulreife ( fach = subject , hochschule = hoch school ( those are universities in germany ) , reife = maturity ) . 
  you can study anything you want on a university of applied science with that . 
  it 's a degree focused on practical usage and not academic . 
  that means you do n't need a second foreign language and mathematics is a bit easier ( which is bullshit . 
  later more to that ) . 
  you can do them with an apprenticeship which is a huge bonus for universities especially since most of the universities of applied science require you to do an internship that is already included in your fhr with apprenticeship . 
  then there 's ahr . 
  a stands for `` general '' . 
  the rest stays . 
  it 's focused on academic work and allows you to study on any university you want to study on . 
  you can do that on a gymnasium as well ( same as sixth form in the uk ) . 
  you can also combine those with an apprenticeship . 
  the last thing is something weird . 
  it is a mixture out of both but you can only study your subject on a university . 
  so if you did a `` fachbedundenes abitur '' ( subject bound abitur ) in cs , you can study cs on a university . 
  if you notice that you like electronics more , you 're fucked . 
  there are literally 20 or more schools you can do either of those degrees on . 
  not it gets a bit easier . 
  universities : 2 of those . 
  if you did your college degree in 3 years , you 're 19 when you start . 
  one is the university and the other is the university of applied science . 
  the university is focused on academic . 
  you could get through the old cs degrees without programming one line of code . 
  mathematics is basically proofing stuff . 
  if you study cs , you have mathematics with mathematics students . 
  it 's theory only . 
  the university of applied science is focused on practical usage of those skills ( so basically working in a non-academic environment ) . 
  the mathematics is a bit easier and you do n't learn stuff you 'll never need . 
  my electronics teacher in college said that 80 % of the mathematics he learnt in uni was a waste of time . 
  the university of applied science prepares you good enough for a master on a university , though . 
  if you 've finished your bachelor , you know enough about mathematics that a master on a university will require some work but you 're not completely lost . 
  and there 's where the bullshit appears . 
  mathematics in schools is bad . 
  really bad . 
  most people fail in scientific subjects because they 've got no idea about mathematics . 
  professors are complaining the entire first semester about bad mathematics skills and blame the school and they 're right . 
  after the first semester , you see how much bullshit schools did . 
  but that 's not the topic . 
  bachelor and master take 10 semesters together . 
  most of the time , the bachelor is 6 and the master 4 . 
  that can shift , though . 
  after your master , you can do your phd . 
  you 'll be overqualified , though . 
  the phd is a research degree . 
  you do n't need it in a normal job . 
  it 's required for chemistry or something like that , though , but not for most other jobs . 
  i think the phd looks different in germany compared to other countries . 
  you take a subject , you write about it and if it 's something new and scientific relevant , you get your phd . 
  a little addition to the college degree . 
  if you do n't want to do that , you can do an apprenticeship . 
  you have to write exams and get a degree in your profession of choice . 
  you get paid and everything . 
  it 's not `` the worse way '' compared to uni just a different way and the german society also see it like that . 
  also , education is a matter for the state . 
  everything i 've said is only for ** north rhine westphalia ** . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : 6-24 if you do everything in one go so basically 18 years . 
  probably . 
  i 'm not sure if he had to go to school until he was 18 but schools were open as long as possible in ww2 so until the allies started to bomb germany , he probably went to school . 
  i know that my grandfather and my grandmother have both degrees . 
  yes , you do . 
  you 've got berufsschule if you do a ausbildung after school . 
  that still counts into the schulpflicht as well as the shit you do if you could n't find a ausbildung after school . 
  we had two people in school after the 10th grade who just quit and started to work as webdesigner and both got a call from my teacher to inform them about that . 
  i think they officially repeated the 11th grade but never came to school again . 
  i live in nrw , by the way so that might be different in other states . 
  it 's not just that . 
  there are also 100 million native germans and i think the french are close to 100 million as well . 
  it is actually worth the money to translate stuff into those languages which makes it impossibile to just hear english every day because everything on tv is german/french . 
  most people get out of school and never hear english ever again . 
  everybody could . 
  which is why the last one was stupid enough to buy into some bullshit the bild said which got him kicked out of office . 
  if you do n't have an irish farmer accent , you 're good with your irish accent in german .
