  she 's literally doing nothing good and if she does something , it 's either complete bullshit ( gay marriage ) or gets shut down by the federal court . 
  you 'd expect people to not take that bullshit forever ... 
  ca n't we just force juncker to do it ? 
  at least he 's slapping politicians that 's better than what we can get on our own . 
  secret service thought that they were just a way for the nsu to get money . 
  basically , the nsu are right wing terrorists . 
  you 're turkish . 
  if you have ever heard about turks getting murdered in germany or houses in district with a lot of immigrants on fire or something like that , that 's the nsu . 
  the thing is , in germany , if you get elected , you get money based on that result . 
  the npd usually get a few seats in the east . 
  our secret service thought that the npd is basically financing the nsu with that money . 
  so they put some government agents into the party and they did such a good job that they 're not leading the party . 
  they also fucked up meaning any evidence ca n't be used against the npd ... ** edit : ** seems like the nsu what not involved and i misremembered, 
  he probably tried to compensate for the subreddit we 're in . 
  and he still failed . 
  for most countries , the democrats would be centre right . 
  / u/savannajeff is probably the only one who will read the damn thing on this subreddit , though . 
  seriously , he might not be the educated man we deserve but he 's the educated man we need !, 
  pod survives ? 
  nailed it . 
  it 's `` anschluss '' . 
  it 's a noun so capital a and the u is short so ss instead of \u00df . 
  it was n't a single country . 
  it was the uk , france , and germany . 
  then the uk decided that it 's none of their business anymore and france lost a lot of power due to a weakened economy . 
  nobody i know wants us to tell anybody what to do in europe . 
  the average german does n't think of germany as europe 's leader . 
  they probably think that we 're only so heavily involved because we gave greece so much money but otherwise , we 're just a pretty big country in the eu . 
  ca n't we just push him off a cliff ? 
  we do n't have a roma problem in germany . 
  we have a problem with organised criminals from eastern europe that happen to be roma . 
  they basically overrun any kind of homeless charity , beg aggressively and use their children for begging and stealing . 
  again , they 're criminals first . 
  they just happen to be roma as well . 
  that 's pretty much the situation in germany at the moment and it 's in acknowledged problem by the central council of roma and sinti . 
  talking about sinti , they do n't like the `` roma '' either because the sinti kind of integrated ( they 've been in germany for 600 years so they should n't have to integrate . 
  what i mean with integrating is living a more socially acceptable life style ) and made being a gypsy something normal and even romanticised but then the `` roma '' came along and ruined it for them . 
  i ca n't speak for greece but in germany , the worst i 'd imagine happening to you is idiots bring surprised that you 're not `` like the others '' ( so racism but the ignorant kind not the aggressive one ) if somebody even notices . 
  for most , you 'll just be american . 
  that 's just a higher resolution . 
  it looks similar for germany https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/deutsche_dialekte.png you could split those up further though . 
  that has nothing to do with ghettos . 
  us : we want to break into that dude 's house so better get a gun because he might have one and shoot us !, 
  germany : we want to break into that dude 's house so better get your trainers and do some warming up before because the worst that this dude might have is a kitchen knife and should we get caught a gun will make the difference between probation or years in prison . 
  you 'd be a fucking stupid criminal to take a gun with you in germany . 
  or any weapon . 
  there 's just no reason for it . 
  since you already mentioned germany : if anybody intends to come to germany and might wander off to not-so-touristy places , bring cash and call your bank that you might withdraw money in germany !, 
  i know a few restaurants and shops that flat out refuse any card . 
  `` here '' as in `` romania '' or `` here '' as in `` this subreddit '' ? 
  whilst the greeks have ( had ) much more money in absolute values than romania , the ( non-sustainable ) living standard was also more expensive . 
  so now most are actually poor even though they might still have more money than romanians . 
  like , they just do n't get shit for it . 
  i do n't think that this is what he 's saying . 
  it reads more like he wants to say that the greek lived above what they could afford making it even worse with tax evasion and after all that , they 're still better off than romania . 
  still , op is comparing greece with post ww2 germany . 
  a country where most big and important cities where bombed to shit and 1 or 2 million refugees coming over from the east . 
  i certainly do n't agree with most things written in this thread or in any thread in this subreddit , for that matter . 
  but what i 've seen a lot over the last years is greek people acting like they 're literally one step below the congo in terms of living standards and , of course , that 's not their fault at all . 
  not even partially . 
  it 's easy for me to ignore such comments here in germany . 
  but i can understand that for somebody in a country with an even worse economy , those comment are infuriating . 
  they should n't have been part of the eu in the first place . 
  this could have been avoided a lot earlier . 
  do n't let greece in the eu , push them up to the standards the eu has had then and still does , and then get them in . 
  this is not all the greeks fault . 
  there was a bunch of shit going on before that . 
  most exciting thing that happens there now is new recruits shooting themselves accidentally according to a comment i read a few weeks ago . 
  it seems stable but stable is obviously not always enough for an ideal situation . 
  german tabloid known for sucking conservative cock . 
  if you want a real weather report you watch stuff like wdr ( west german broadcast ) and ndr ( north german broadcast ) or other regional stations . 
  those give you only the weather for your state . 
  my father is an undertaker here in germany . 
  before his business was running well enough ( it 's all about `` returning customers '' where the customer is the family not opa getting up again asking for a rerun . 
  so it takes some time even though there is n't really a lack of dying people or something ) , he could never go on holiday during summer . 
  too many people die during these days . 
  it 's like in a call centre , ca n't even have dinner without somebody calling . 
  a lot of older old people homes do n't have proper cooling and they call right when somebody dies so you have surprise early work because in these temperatures , you do n't want dead bodies in not properly cooled places . 
  also fun in nrw because there are so many cities next to each other with really full motor ways . 
  enjoy your stau . 
  thank whoever engineered it for air con !, 
  and why should anybody care what anybody ** thinks ** this is about ? 
  the information what this is actually about is available for everybody . 
  if they actually care , they read it . 
  he said dubious and not flat out shit . 
  dubious can also mean that certain other subreddits were not touched even though they should have been ,, 
  it 's not about that victoria lady . 
  read the post . 
  it 's about the lack of admin -  mod communication and outdated mod tools . 
  there are private conversations between admins that have been leaked . 
  but the current living standard is not sustainable . 
  i 'm already assuming that i 'll never get pension from the government even though i 'm still in university . 
  right now , somebody needs to do something . 
  our system was built on the assumption that there will always be new children . 
  then the pill came along . 
  then we integrated all the east germans into the system that never paid into the west german system which is fine but you need to adjust for that . 
  and we did n't . 
  if we continue like we do now we will hit a point where everything just goes down fast . 
  and then it 's too late . 
  and it 's not just that .
