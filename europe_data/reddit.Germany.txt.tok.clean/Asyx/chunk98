  you mean like the italians and greece who said right here on reddit that they see corruption in their country almost daily ? 
  those damn german press ... brainwashing people that do n't even get their news channels / probably do n't speak the language . 
  literally worse than hitler !, 
  as far as i know , greece and italy did n't even fulfil the initial requirements for joining the eu . 
  there 're just in the eu because they thought it 's a good idea to get them in for being `` the birth place of democracy '' which is bollocks of course . 
  i do n't know much about the state of the eu right in this moment but i doubt that anybody except the scandinavians actually fulfil the requirements for staying in the eu . 
  so why do n't we tidy up properly ? 
  oh yeah ... because then we 'd disband the eu ... 
  you can get very very far with an apprenticeship . 
  at least here in germany . 
  and in the end , a less paid job that is fun is worth more than any money , i believe . 
  maybe he wo n't get the same money a m.sc computer science would get and he probably would n't get far away from whatever he has done in his apprenticeship but is the trouble of mathematics and more and more exams really worth it if what you want to do is in reach a lot earlier , a lot less stressful and a lot more fun for you ? 
  if i look at my high school class , it is already a small miracle that he knows what he want 's to do . 
  i know a lot of people that just accepted the first job they could find . 
  and then switched between apprenticeships because they just did n't know what they want to do with their life . 
  i think to not support your brother would be a very bad thing to do . 
  apprenticeships are pretty normal . 
  parents are still proud when their children do an apprenticeship at big companies like siemens or bmw . 
  instead of viewing people with apprenticeship not clever enough it 's more like people with bachelor or master are just over average clever . 
  at least that 's how the middle class sees it . 
  studying is still something special and especially since there are other ways that do n't involve 5-8 more years of school to make a decent living , a lot of people do n't even consider it . 
  well the professional education ( i think apprenticeship is the other english word . 
  just in case i took the least used word from the dictionary ) is like a degree for one single profession . 
  if we take computer science , then you 'd have one `` profession '' as a network administrator , database administrator , programmer and so on . 
  that is basically what you 're doing on a university in a computer science degree but only that one aspect is done in your professional education . 
  of course with less mathematics but still with school and everything and at the end , you 've got a degree that involves the theory as well as the practical use in real life . 
  to be honest , the `` i need experience to get a job to get experience ... '' vicious cycle was pretty new to me when i discovered reddit a year ago . 
  but i do n't know if that actually solved that problem or if i just know lucky people but i know that even 20 years of experience do n't save you if you 've never done something that 's written on paper somewhere . 
   and that is fortunate for you , hooray for uni education !, 
  yep !, 
  i was really worried when i was in college and had to think about what i want to do afterwards . 
  i thought a professional education would restrict me too much and a university was n't in reach . 
  but then the socialists won the state election and the first thing they did was to make universities almost free !, 
  i was in paris last year . 
  it 's expensive but enjoyable . 
  i 've heard scotland is still very nice for students . 
  i hope the current system holds on in germany . 
  they changed it here in north rhine westphalia just a year ago . 
  before that , you had to pay a lot for university on your own and i could never pay that if they 'd change it back . 
  well if we assume that people do n't know that it 's basically a free std test then what happens if the donated are kind of forced to donate . 
  like a girl friend he 's cheated on and he thinks that his last one night stand probably were a much better deal with a condom . 
  of course it 's not pretty nice to cover that lie up but better like that then any other possible way which and a probably contaminated blood pack somebody has missed . 
  what they 've basically told me was `` if you think the girl last weekend was n't as clean as you thought in the first place or you 've got in contact with stranger 's blood and you did n't know that guy or you just want a free test for numerous viruses and diseases , put on the red sticker just to be sure . '', 
  i think it 's probably also a possibility to provide free tests for people that ca n't afford them . 
  what are you doing when you think you could have a std and you can afford a test ? 
  you pay for it without questioning the price . 
  what do you do if you 're a teenager trying to hide it from your parents and you ca n't afford a std test on your own ? 
  you tell mum that you want to donate blood and put on the red sticker . 
  i think it 's probably the first hit on google if you 'd search for `` free aids test '' in german that would lead you to a blood donation . 
  tl ; dr free aids test and do n't bring chronic cheaters into a position where they have to decide between their marriage or hoping for the red cross to not fuck up . 
  food and drinks and somebody that holds your hand while you vomit if it 's your first time and it makes you dizzy . 
  also , a free tests for stds . 
  if you donate blood , you have to put 2 different stickers on your formula and those sticker says `` yes , use my blood '' or `` no , do n't use my blood '' . 
  if you take the `` no '' sticker , they 'll still test the blood for any kind of virus or disease and send you a letter with the results . 
  we do n't get money in germany anymore since a lot of homeless people would donate blood just for the money and the blood was mostly useless and the bunch of smelly homeless people would scare away legit people . 
  well if i think about it ... trousers are n't that bad either . 
  the cheapest shoes i 've found where chucks . 
  70 $ per pair and you can wear them until they fall apart . 
  i 've also got some weird feet shenanigans going on ( i do n't know the english word . 
  it 's like a flatfoot but different ) which require me to wear insoles and they 're also the only shoes i can wear with and without insoles because the shoe is not as static as the other possibility ( basketball shoes which cost at least 100 $ ) and can handle the extra stuff inside my shoe from the fairly thick insoles without looking weird from above . 
  =o portugal is a very cheap place . 
  you 'd probably get a steak here in central d\u00fcsseldorf - germany for 20 $ but that 's it . 
  one bare fillet steak without anything . 
  ca n't talk about cloths ... 
  since i 'm 1.95 m and have shoe size 49/50 ( european of course ) , i ca n't buy cheap stuff because it just does n't exist in my size ( or not in the quality i 'd expect ) so i guess a way smaller person could get something for 20 $ i think 20 $ for internet and phone would work . 
  tv not so much since the only provider for everything here does n't go that low . 
  i get from the old town home for 25 $ which is 11.8 km . 
  20 $ is 4 packages of cigarettes as far as i remember . 
  you can get a cheap but drinkable bottle of whisky or vodka that does n't taste like glass cleaner ( i think skyy costs 25 $ / l or 0.7 ml ) you can get a cheap meal for 2 with pizza and coke or stuff like that . 
  italian restaurants can be cheap and fancy sometimes . 
  i 've forgotten how much you pay for a public transport ticket since i have had a pupil ticket for 9 years and now my student ticket which were paid by my mum in school and now with the semi-annual fee for university . 
  ~ 200-400 $ / semester in germany and that includes a public transport ticket for the whole state . 
  i think you can actually apply for the `` only pay back 50 % '' student credit as a foreigner . 
  yep . 
  mostly 10 $ / g in the west if you do n't know people . 
  well finland is always trying to kill sweden , denmark and norway in those comics . 
  also , he 's always drunk as fuck . 
  satw comics showed me that we ca n't trust you  :(, 
  i think somebody who jumps out of the nothing and calls me ignorant does n't give me enough space to judge if there is more than against or for me . 
  and i 've said multiple times now that this was n't listing facts . 
  i was listing my opinion why bavaria is n't as perfect as he thought but i 've said that i think that you can make those kind of stuff with every state as well . 
  if i 'd say that nrw is the best because of all the nice companies we 've got ( siemens , tysson krupp , henkel ) , one could counter that with the same stuff i 've said about bavarian cars . 
  no serious bavarian bashing intended . 
  or are we calling `` we are awesome ! '', 
  `` no you 're not that awesome because ... '' selling opinion as facts ? 
  because then you 'd be right but nothing more than a redditor who 's jumping on the band wagon that also drove all the way to `` we hate ea '' , `` steam is awesome '' and `` steam is bad '' . 
  the german word for `` derision '' is `` hohn '' or `` spott '' which is exactly what i did . 
  i do n't even know why am i talking to you but your quite pathetic . 
  i get a answer that is like `` fuck you cunt bavaria is the best because that that that and that fuck your mum and piss off '' ( i 'm distending because i 'm tired of people that do n't see the point ) and then i say that this does n't work perfect and this does n't work perfect and this does n't work perfect because that 's what the guy said !, 
  bavaria is better at everything !!!, 
  ** that 's what the fuck he said ** i have ** never ** said that i have the right facts and he is totally wrong . 
  i think we actually got to a point later on where we were kind of agreeing except that he 'd like to live in bavaria and i 'm not ( which i have n't said then to not give nutters like you that are butt clinching again more stuff to get a shit fit about ) . 
  stop seeing everything in black and white shades . 
  you know where is bullshirt argument `` you 're selling your opinion as fact '' comes from ? 
  because people like you just read what is written and than get a shit fit or not . 
  you have n't tried to see my point at all . 
  you were just butt clinching . 
  [ sarcasm ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sarcasm )  harsh or bitter derision check !, 
   a sharply ironical taunt check !, 
  ( and the taunt obviously worked better than expected ) it 's not my fault that you do n't get a sarcastic comment about a stereotype every comedian and their mother has used yet or is making a living of .
