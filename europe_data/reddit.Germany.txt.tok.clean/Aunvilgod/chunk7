  ah because next year we wont have taxes ? 
  do n't compare people who are far left to criminals . 
  thank you . 
  being `` too inviting '' to immigrants is something completely different than burning down stuff or trying to hurt immigrants . 
  there you go , now the racist shit shows his face . 
  about 5 million if we cut some stuff , maybe 1 million if we dont . 
  if we try to deal with our demographic problem and allow them to work maybe 20 million . 
  immigrants will give you a net gain , if you allow them to work . 
  just like it happened in america in the early 20th century . 
  we can easily take them . 
  for all poor people that come to germany . 
  refugees are not as expensive as people make them out to be . 
  and even if they were we could sacrifice a tiny bit of our luxury to help people in need . 
  but right now the ** unexpected ** tax surplus is enough to cover the costs . 
  communists ? 
  easily : the calculation of the expected tax profits this year was ( positively ) off by more than the refugees would cost . 
  we can handle those immigrants super easily . 
  and we should also give them jobs . 
  there is a certain correlation though . 
  i do n't know what you are trying to tell me . 
  i meant somewhere which is developed and not full of racist shits but i could n't think of any place . 
  i am not a racist , no . 
  mindboggling is n't it . 
  he implies that this sub becoming shittier due to influx of new people as its a default for new redditors . 
  this sub being representative of europe is the logical consequence . 
  ignoring the brigading and all that stuff of course . 
   the larger a community gets , the shittier most of the time . 
  that implies that the majority of the european ( young !!! ), 
  population is far right , maybe even extreme . 
  if so i better start planning moving to ... somewhere . 
  you do n't actually believe that , do you ? 
  great now you could just really quickly ad the - an at the end of the url to this sub and things would be normal again . 
  / r/europe - / r/almostracist, 
  i ca n't read that . 
  since when are non-english submissions allowed ? 
  oh look i spotted the nazi !, 
  would you from your current perspective like to live under hitler with a brainwashed mind ? 
  you would not i think . 
  remember that subjective feelings do not have to be taken into account . 
  objectively it was liberation . 
  that 90 % of the population was not objective at all does n't mean anything . 
  would ** you ** like to live under hitler ? 
  i assume not . 
  so while for them it might be defeat for me its definitely liberation . 
  profits of car production per 1000 people would look different . 
   so instead of contributing to the discussion you openly insult all those that agree with you ? 
  this does n't advance any kind of argument you might have . 
  so next time you come across a comment that disagrees with views you hold , please try to engage in a nice civil debate instead of outright name-calling ? 
  i am not sure about the sense of a discussion about ethics between people with completely different moral views . 
  or maybe i 'm already fed up with the selfcentered egoists in / r/de . 
  or maybe i do n't want to discuss with the people who were happy about two 14 year old kids dying for their mistakes . 
  who knows . 
   are you surprised or are you saying your first post was a joke ? 
  well lets just say that in a moment of rage about ~ ~ the worlds cruelty ~ ~ the cruelty of the selfish fuckers here i might have slipped and deleted it . 
   the problem is that people love to throw bad labels on people with dissenting views . 
  as soon as you suggest that maybe immigration should be limited you 're suddenly neo-nazi and you 're told to fuck off to / r/european . 
  exactly , i am one of these people . 
  rofl my first post got upvotes ? 
  if i was a mod here i would have deleted this racist shithole alltogether long ago . 
  overstatement maybe but close enough . 
  no , that was the journalists . 
  the army said they were great . 
  especially important that france and germany are both in favor ... even if the germans do n't seem ethusiastic i am very sure that there wo n't be much resistance against the idea either . 
  i have higher expectations than that . 
  she is too economy friendly , for my taste . 
  it is a centre-right party after all . 
  if her current agenda is the status quo it could still be improved . 
   ( which means that she rarely generates political friction ) no , it rather means that even people who follow politics very closely have only a veeery blurry idea of what here political views might be . 
  she does a ( relatively ) good job but nobody knows what she actually wants , what her goals are . 
  surprisingly sane comments on this one yet . 
  all those racist fuckers on this sub are part of the problem ... 
  sch\u00e4uble is an idiot, 
  if its engineered by german engineers its german as far as i 'm concerned . 
  they should n't be racist , they should n't be islamophobes , they should try to help people in need period . 
  they should be good humans . 
  nobody questions that people who are against refugee camps are fucking assholes ... 
   i ca n't help but think that the never ending self-flagellation of europe exists only so we can feel morally superior to others ( china , turkey , etc. ) . 
  we can also use it as an excuse to give money to help african countries because we can call ppl who are against it nazis . 
  i can not explain why this gets upvoted so much ? 
  did / r/europe suddenly turn leftist ? 
  or , more likely , are people just too retarded to understand it properly ? 
   good news and this is everything wrong with you fuckers . 
  in dubio pro reo , so do n't claim they are terrorists or whatever until you know they are !, 
  what happens at 140 % ? 
  i am german and this is still confusing . 
  today my friend was reading a bunch of pressures from a manometer and fuck it was confusing to type them hahaha . 
  i expected pictures of immigrants living in poverty to see what an immigration crisis looks like . 
  was disappointed . 
  you are equalizing religion with people , big mistake . 
  yay fearmongering, 
  absolutely . 
  just because northern europe goes through a golden age right now does n't mean shit for the future . 
  and no more d\u00f6ner -  no more sch\u00f6ner . 
  * get rid of, 
  give up hope, 
  also the least tolerated minorities on / r/europe it appears . 
  sad, 
  whats olive green ? 
   to avoid blanket bans of that category of chemicals , and instead to ban via evidence and impact-based assessments . 
  that sounds like an outrageous oversimplification though .
