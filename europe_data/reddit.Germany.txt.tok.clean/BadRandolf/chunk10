  that support is n't just being pissed into the wind no questions asked , as greece found out . 
  what they want is an eu that enters these negotiations looking out for * our * best interests . 
  and the uk will enter the negotiations looking out for * their * best interests . 
  and then negotiations happen and a compromise is reached . 
  it 's the standard process for any international agreement . 
  remember that one of the reasons for creating the eu was to increase europe 's negotiating power in the world to secure better trade deals . 
  united we stand and all that jazz . 
  it 's exactly why trump 's trade advances to individual countries were rebuffed . 
  the uk decided not to be a part of that anymore , and that 's fair enough . 
  i want the uk to be treated like any other non-eu country in the negotiations , that 's all . 
  we were able to reach a fta with countries like canada and iceland so i do n't see why a fta with the uk should be impossible . 
  what should be obvious to everyone is that such an agreement wo n't have the same benefits as membership does . 
  that 's not a punishment , it 's what 's called `` exiting the eu '' . 
  would n't be a need for carry-on if they gas everyone on the plane . 
  pump in sleeping gas before takeoff and wake up at your destination . 
  saves money on flight attendants and entertainment systems too !, 
  looked pretty easy when jeremy clarkson did it , i saw it on the telley . 
  you 're just trying to come up with replies to keep the argument going without actually thinking about what 's being discussed . 
  i 'm not interested in doing that . 
  i 'll leave you with one thought though : the number of true things is finite , the number of untrue things is infinite . 
  maybe you can deduce out of that what the logical default assumption should be when you 're presented with information that seems dubious . 
   and no , i should n't `` feel bad '' about not immediately dismissing evidence because of the website it was posted on . 
  yes , you should . 
  a healthy skepticism is good particularly in today 's climate . 
  if you see something scrawled onto the wall of a public toilet you should immediately assume it 's horseshit , not `` hey one or two things in public toilets actually turned out to be true , so i 'm going to give this the benefit of the doubt '' . 
  if * any * place on the internet is like the wall of a public toilet it 's 4chan , and reddit as a primary source is n't far behind . 
  if these were real the guy would have sent copies of the whole stack of documents to several reputable journals instead of posting a few photos on fucking 4chan . 
  until independent parties corroborate this it 's * literally * fake news that 's designed to stay in the public eye just long enough to survive the election . 
  you should honestly feel bad for not being more skeptical of it , regardless of your own political leanings or motivations . 
  i 'd say the same if this were documents about le pen supposedly being ` leaked ' on 4chan , or here for that matter . 
  there was a study done a while back on sugar free haribo , it 's not wise to eat more than 2kg of them in one sitting : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smjgaa5j_le, 
  it 's not always about helping the economy or maximizing profits , sometimes you force companies to operate in a certain way simply because it 's the right thing to do . 
  at the end of the day these are real people we 're talking about . 
  if you can ensure they 're treated fairly and given a healthy work-life balance at the cost of 10 % less profit or whatever then maybe it 's worth the tradeoff . 
  but no company would ever willingly make that trade because a company 's sole motive is to maximize profit . 
  they 'd just as soon outsource all those jobs to bangladesh if it improves their bottom line . 
  companies are n't evil but this singular motive of maximizing profit is n't always compatible with what 's good for workers , or good for the environment , or good for public safety . 
  that 's why they need to be given rules to work inside of . 
  even the us has rules for companies , tons of them . 
  germany just decided to have a lot more , in some areas even too many . 
  it 's not `` paying to trade '' , what are you talking about ? 
  the money each state contributes funds all kinds of infrastructure and development projects , mostly in less developed european countries but also in countries like the uk . 
  those budgets are decided in 7 year intervals . 
  the last one was decided in 2013 and lasts until 2020 . 
  the uk agreed to it along with all the other member states . 
  in return the projects that were planned for the uk will be completed as planned , even if they 're scheduled for 2020 . 
  so yeah , it 's exactly like signing a contract and being held to the terms . 
  the projects those funds were allocated to have already been planned and/or are being built right now , you ca n't just decide to walk away from them . 
  have * you * grasped this now ? 
  again , it depends how you look at it . 
  if i cancel my gym membership i save money , but the `` price for leaving '' is that i do n't get to use the machines at the gym anymore . 
  that 's not a punishment , it 's a natural consequence of not being a member of the gym . 
  why would anyone pay for membership if they could use the machines without it ? 
  just take a step back from these vague phrases and start talking about concrete issues , that 's all i 'm saying . 
  that goes for all of us , on both sides . 
  the `` demand '' for 100bn came from the financial times . 
  nobody from the eu uttered that number , it 's something the ft came up with based on `` their own formula '' . 
  it said so right there in the [ bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39789903 ) everyone has been linking today :  on wednesday , ** the financial times claimed ** the likely bill had risen sharply from 60bn to 100bn euros , ** basing its calculations on new data from across europe . 
  ** before the bbc changed it it was even more direct :  on wednesday , ** the financial times claimed ** the likely bill , ** on the basis of its formula ** , had risen sharply from 60bn to 100bn euros . 
  honestly , this is getting out of hand . 
  one news outlet prints a story with numbers they pulled out of their ass and people are at each other 's throats over it . 
  both sides need to take a deep breath and chill out . 
  i was n't asking about an example , i was asking about the deal as a whole . 
  access to the single market ? 
  membership in it ? 
  free movement ? 
  contributions to the eu ? 
  visa free travel ? 
  expats rights ? 
  financial passporting ? 
  how does all that fit into this mutually beneficial deal ? 
  or is this just a meaningless talking point being thrown around to inflame both sides ? 
   a mutually beneficial deal is the worst possible outcome for the eu and is therefore unattainable . 
  it 's really not . 
  canada and the eu have mutually beneficial deals on trade and visas and all kinds of things , as do many other countries . 
  the worst possible outcome for the eu is for the uk to end up with the same benefits it had as a member without any of the responsibilities , and it should be pretty clear why they ca n't let that happen . 
  people keep throwing around this phrase `` mutually beneficial '' without ever defining what they mean . 
  it 's gotten completely out of hand because everyone has different expectations of what 's `` mutually beneficial '' , so everyone feels like they 're in the right about it . 
  what would a mutually beneficial deal look like , in your opinion ? 
  the eu has been making the same statements for the past 6 months . 
  then may calls an election , the same statements continue but suddenly they 're evidence that the eu is trying to influence the election . 
  it 's an absurd story spun by her to ( rather ironically ) influence the election . 
  politics as usual . 
  few things from the article here :  on wednesday , ** the financial times claimed ** the likely bill , ** on the basis of its formula ** , had risen sharply from 60bn to 100bn euros . 
   `` this is a negotiation . 
  they lay down what they want and we lay down what we want . '', 
   various figures ranging from 50bn to 100bn euros had been knocking around , he said , ** but he had `` not seen '' any official numbers . 
  ** seems like this `` inflating fee '' is a bunch of rumours started by a news agency , but i guess you can blame it on eu hostility if it fits your world view . 
  / r/unitedkingdom is more of a circle sob . 
  one of the most depressing places on reddit . 
  alright friend , i 'll try to explain the difference . 
  you make it seem like the uk citizens are still insured under the nhs , and that the nhs continues to cover their bills even if they live outside the uk . 
  if it were that simple there 'd be no problem , presumably the nhs would just keep covering them after brexit . 
  in reality those people are not in the nhs anymore , nor are they covered by it . 
  they 're registered in the spanish health care system and are covered by spanish health care . 
  the fact that the uk reimburses those costs to the spanish government ** will go away ** after brexit , * unless * a new agreement is reached . 
  obviously that new agreement will have to be part of any agreement about citizen 's rights post-brexit . 
  is that clearer ? 
  the nhs is not covering the costs . 
  the retirees are using the spanish health care system , then later the uk reimburses those costs to the spanish government .
