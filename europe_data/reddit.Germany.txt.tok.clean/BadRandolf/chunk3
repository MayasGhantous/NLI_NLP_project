  it 's perfectly ok to disagree with these opinions and , in fact , disagreement should be encouraged in order to facilitate a good discussion ... 
  the warnings were `` you are ** approaching ** turkish airspace , turn south immediately '' . 
  what an asshole . 
  technically it was n't a russian military jet either . 
  both pilots were there on vacation , just sightseeing . 
  lessons on how to say `` no '' would probably help a lot more . 
  because once someone tells you `` no i do n't want to '' * at any point * it 's very clear what the deal is . 
  explicit consent is a lot more complicated . 
  is willingness consent ? 
  is consent to kiss also consent to fondle ? 
  is consent to fondle consent to take off a shirt ? 
  how does it fit into the idea of spontaneity that a lot of people say they like ? 
  * that 's * a minefield . 
  and we do n't need it . 
  all we need is a simple rule : if you 're uncomfortable at * any * point just say no . 
  that goes for both genders . 
   a consent lesson would have been soooo welcome as would a lesson for the girl on how to say `` no '' . 
  you 'll probably still get downvoted but do n't take it personal . 
  it 's just the usual reddit circlejerking that happens when enough people with the same outlook get together in a sub . 
  i think it 's good to see some positive stories posted here too . 
  i think you misunderstand . 
  nobody is saying all refugees are terrorists ( except maybe a handful of idiots , but that 's a given in any context ) . 
  it 's just that this sub is more focused on the problems involved that need to be worked out . 
  ignoring those problems with a pie in the sky attitude is just as dangerous as stereotyping . 
  it 's ignoring reality in favor of some utopia that does n't exist and * ca n't * exist . 
  just different outlooks on the same problem . 
  you need all kinds to come up with a workable solution . 
  i do n't think we can expect them to be able to support themselves for a year . 
  that would restrict migration to the top 1 % in these countries , and siphoning off all their most skilled people would probably make the situation there even worse . 
  hell most westerners would have trouble putting up the money to support themselves for a year . 
  to put things in perspective the average ** annual ** salary in gambia is 300 usd . 
  there 's no evidence that they 're using bitcoin for that either . 
  [ thread anthem ?

  charlie brooker 's gon na have his hands full for the wipe this year , that 's for sure . 
  canada has lost several though . 
  there 's even [ an ongoing case ] ( http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/topics-domaines/disp-diff/lone.aspx?lang=eng ) where a canadian subsidiary is suing the canadian government through an american parent company . 
  which , apparently , is perfectly fine under nafta 's isds . 
   or the eu needs to look at simpler agreements that are within the eus competencies . 
  exactly . 
  if this deal were limited to things like removing tariffs and equalizing qualifications it would n't even need a vote on the national level . 
  but instead of removing the clauses that forced this to become a mixed agreement everyone is choosing to whine about regions using their democratic right to veto it instead . 
  the eu concluded a massive ( in terms of scope ) trade deal with south korea just last year . 
  ceta got pulled into the fallout of garbage deals like acta and ttip . 
  many people ( probably wrongly ) see ceta as a proxy for the same interests that were involved in drafting ttip . 
  people are not ` against free trade ' they 've just lost trust in the process of negotiating these huge , comprehensive agreements . 
  a huge number of people are n't experts in international trade law . 
  they rely on layman 's breakdowns that are often biased to one side or the other and an element of trust in the process which has been drug through the dirt thanks to acta and ttip . 
  so it 's not about the merits of ceta anymore but a lack of trust in the process of negotiating these kinds of comprehensive deals . 
  if they want to push something like this through in today 's climate they 're going to have to split it into smaller chunks focused on one issue at a time . 
  and while we 're dreaming how about redirecting the church tax to infrastructure instead ? 
  call it bridges for jesus or something . 
  that 'll really get some wires crossed in bavaria . 
  even if we did get the reduction it would n't take long for it to disappear . 
  in 5-10 years the tax would be raised again for ` environmental reasons ' or some such and the toll would still be there . 
  a bank is a unique kind of business that should n't be treated like other businesses . 
  we make exceptions for them by providing these bailouts and in the same spirit there should be exceptions for liability too . 
  * personal * liability for the people in charge . 
  that 's the only way a bank can be held accountable without endangering everything else . 
  yes i 've lived this free market , deregulated , businessman 's paradise approach in america . 
  the downsides that inevitably come with this philosophy far outweigh the benefits imo . 
  unless , of course , you 're already rich , then it 's a real good time . 
  and this just days after international talk like a pirate day . 
  probably . 
  more than five even !, 
  could be 6 , could be 50 !, 
  the point is they 're all bastards , the telegraph understands . 
  i do n't think you read the article . 
  he 's basically saying america ` takes one for the team ' so the rest of us can enjoy all the innovation that comes out of being able to fleece 300 million people for massive profit . 
  is that an article with a direct link to the actual poll ? 
  am i dreaming ? 
  the relevant tables are on pages 414 and 434 in the pdf . 
  in europe almost half of the people surveyed do n't have an opinion either way , and the agree/disagree segments are practically equal . 
  in fact , when you average the results from europe it slightly favors a good deal for britain . 
  but it 's a wonderful headline because it 's technically true no matter what the result of the poll . 
  as long as at least 2 voters in the eu responded with `` tough deal '' you can rightfully declare `` say voters in the eu '' . 
  it should be illegal for news media to reference statistics or studies without including a link to the actual study . 
  lets encase it in cement and dump it [ right here ] ( https://www.google.ca/maps/place/30%c2%b006'01.0%22n+42%c2%b031'22.4%22w/@30.6067411,-42.4924647,264388m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d30.10028!4d-42.52288 ) . 
  only a few international treaties to rewrite . 
  fair enough , but i think that 's a pretty big ` if ' to gamble with . 
  and in the mean time it 'll still be a problem for uk industry . 
  problem is those companies are going to be competing against other eu companies who do have access to cheap labor . 
  the only real solution to that is import tariffs . 
  would you pack up and move to another country if you 're still getting unemployment benefits ? 
  nah i think there 's a legit reason for it . 
  i think they 're trying to create a system that has benefits * and * drawbacks for every country , with the goal being that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks for * all * countries . 
  some countries benefit from freedom of movement more than freedom of capital , others from freedom of service more than freedom of movement and so on . 
  what 's bad for you might be good for someone else and what 's bad for them might be good for you . 
  that kind of system only works if everyone plays by the same rules . 
  the minute one country gets to pick only the beneficial things the whole thing falls apart . 
   so because you disagree with some parts of the agreement we should scrap the entire thing ? 
  yes . 
  and that 's on the negotiators . 
  they knew from the start it would be an all-or-nothing deal once it reaches ratification and they 've known for quite some time now which provisions people have a problem with . 
  if they choose to leave those provisions in then the ratification will fail . 
  that 's why the ratification process exists in the first place . 
  it 's not my problem that they elected to write one behemoth deal instead of piecemealing it , knowing that they 'd have to sell the whole thing to the public . 
   it might not be the best deal but it is better than the status quo . 
  that 's entirely subjective and i do n't agree . 
  i 'd rather go on without the trade deal like we have been than risk corrupting our laws and institutions for a few percent extra gdp .
