  if the good parts really are good for both sides then take those out and draft them into a new agreement . 
  if they come with strings attached that risk torpedoing the deal then obviously the need for them is n't that great , is it ? 
   say the u.s. creates a law that states all products from country x in industry y will receive a tariff , but domestic producers will not , than of course the foreign company that is negatively affected by this should be able to remedy it . 
  how else would you enforce the agreement ? 
  through diplomacy , same as it 's always been done . 
  diplomat a meets with diplomat b and says `` hey , wtf do you think you 're doing ? '' . 
  then they have a little pow wow and come to a solution , or not . 
  if they reach an impasse then you 've got a disagreement on your hands that will have diplomatic repercussions for both sides . 
  that 's how it 's worked for hundreds of years , why do you feel the need to change it ? 
  right , and i personally do n't agree with some of the provisions in the proposal and the way it was negotiated . 
  since it 'll be an all-or-nothing deal by the time it reaches the ratification vote i 'm against the treaty as is . 
  so you see you * can * be for one form of influence and against another without being hypocritical . 
  it 's really quite easy . 
  edit : as for the arbitration courts , they will be responsible for * interpreting * the law as written in the treaty . 
  not simply enforcing it . 
  when the laws themselves were written with close input from the groups who themselves will be using the arbitration courts later , well that creates a bit of a problem . 
  especially when you 're talking about many hundreds of pages of legalese , one vaguely chosen word can have major ramifications down the line if some random arbitration court decides it does . 
  i do n't trust it , simple as that . 
  for one that foreign influence follows a democratic process while the influence in ttip can be applied by corporations through arbitration courts . 
  to be fair nothing has actually happened yet . 
  the real test starts when article 50 is invoked . 
  this whole thing feels like being in one of those money booths where you try to grab as much cash as you can . 
  except instead of cash flying around it 's knob heads . 
  what kind of morons would want to trigger their own referendum before seeing how this pans out for the uk over the next 2 years ? 
  apparently all you have to do is say `` that was a mistake , but it was n't my mistake ! '', 
  getting pretty desperate now ... 
  [ obligatory idiocracy clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs4mtbtsal4 ), 
  there could be , but i think at that point the only option on the table would be full membership . 
  i doubt the eu bigwigs will be keen to give any kind of special status back to the uk . 
  you know , the smart thing to do would be to wait at least a year and see what the impact of this is on both the uk and the eu . 
  what a golden opportunity for other countries to gauge the risks without having to put their own feet in the fire !, 
  who gets the honor of being hitler in this analogy ? 
  has anyone asked ja rule what he thinks about all this ? 
  the tragically hip , matthew good , metric ... at least they 're trying to make up for it . 
  we already pay a fuel tax and an annual vehicle tax . 
  is n't that money going to the roads ? 
   the confusion has arisen partly because the european union has so far failed to regulate the size of standard letters across the continent . 
  that 's some grade a irony right there . 
  what would that accomplish ? 
  the decisions by arbitration courts are by definition just because they 're the sole decider of justice in this system . 
  i could post my opinion of the individual cases , you 'd post your opinion , and in the end we 'd be no further along than we were before . 
  i 'll be there next week for ccp 's nerdfest . 
  looking forward to seeing iceland for the first time !, 
  not for fully autonomous vehicles . 
  the technology will be ready in a few years , but i think we 'll be relying on a driver at least being in the cab for a long time to come . 
  the main reason being liability . 
  reminds me of the infamous [ cdu cleavage ad ] ( https://karleduardskanal.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/merkel-lengsfeld.jpg%3fw%3d500%26h%3d347 ) from years ago . 
  tagline reads `` cdu : we have more to offer '', 
  the goal of the eu is to be seen as one body in the global economy . 
  you do n't trade with spain or germany or portugal , you trade with the eu . 
  you emigrate to the eu . 
  you work in the eu . 
  that 's the whole point of the single market and you seem to have missed it entirely . 
  the old ones were made of wooden slats held together with chain links . 
  i 'm not sure how old they are but my great-grandmother grew up with them , so i 'd say 100 years at least . 
  sure they were . 
  lots of houses here still have manual ones that you open and close with a strap that you pull on . 
  [ some random video showcasing them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcudappwoam&amp;t=1m18s ) i find them really handy and i always wondered why they were n't more common in canada back when i lived there . 
  merkel did n't do that , the interviewer did . 
  when the interviewer asked about possible sanctions she said she does n't think that would be a good idea , that the eu commission should continue talking with hungary and poland and that the member states would need to decide on what action to take . 
  so , pretty much the opposite . 
  we invited * refugees * , not hordes of economic migrants . 
  you seem to have trouble distinguishing the two so here are the definitions :  ** refugee **  a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster . 
   ** economic migrant ** a person who travels from one country or area to another in order to improve their standard of living . 
  i 'm not worried about that . 
  80,000 were deported last year and with the rising afd putting more pressure on the government before the election they 'll be stepping it up hard this year . 
  there 's already talk about waiving the safe country of origin rules on an eu level in times of mass migration like this . 
  you 're talking about economic migrants , we 're talking about refugees of a warzone . 
  two different things . 
  and fyi those economic migrants are n't getting asylum here . 
  do n't talk shit dude . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war look at that table and look at a map . 
  the only safe countries near syria took in millions of people over the course of 5 years and they stayed there . 
  they only started spilling over to the next safest place ( the eu ) after those countries were completely saturated . 
  the rest of the neighbors are either straight up hostile to refugees ( iran , israel ) or the same kind of terrorist shithole that they 're fleeing . 
  overall they were at 4.8 % in the last election and they 're fluctuating between 6 % -11 % right now . 
  but a lot can happen between now and september . 
  when greece joined the ez it gained access to loans that were far cheaper than their economy would allow them to get on their own . 
  that * should * have been a great kickstart to economic growth , instead it ended in economic disaster . 
  so yes , i think they would still have such problems and will continue to have such problems until they change their fiscal policies . 
  still too early to say . 
  realistically either schulz or merkel will win , and whoever it is will have to form a coalition again . 
  afd will end up with more seats than last election but have practically no chance of forming a government . 
  will be interesting to see how the fdp does since they used to be a big party but did n't even make the 5 % cutoff last time . 
  greece is a democracy . 
  that 's right . 
  so this time they 're being forced to rebuild the warehouse out of fireproof material , even if it 's more expensive and takes longer . 
  someone 's negligence causes a fire in a warehouse . 
  the fire department arrives and starts fighting the fire , but due to some mistakes they 're only able to save 1/4 of the warehouse instead of 1/2 of it . 
  there 's plenty of blame in this scenario but it 's clear who 's to blame for the fire . 
  foreign banks took a 50 % haircut on their loans to greece , that is n't a serious hit in your opinion ?? 
   tldr u can blame greece all u want up to 2010 but u cant put the blame in greece for most of what happened next . 
  what happened next was the consequences of the greek government 's failures , that 's all . 
  you ca n't just spend your way into a hole and then rely on foreign bailouts to rescue you without real consequences . 
  especially not when you 're shielded from most of the conventional consequences by being a member of the ez , * and * your actions have consequences for the rest of the ez . 
  you keep talking about ` saving greece ' , it 's not that simple . 
  maybe part of saving greece in the long term is forcing changes to make sure this does n't happen again . 
  maybe that makes things worse in the short term but leads to a more stable fiscal policy down the line . 
  if it was just about recovering the greek economy in the short term of course things would be done differently , but that 's not it at all . 
  another way of looking at it is that the greek government fudged their own books , then used cheap loans backed by the ez to keep funding their unsustainable fiscal policies .
