  everyone has a different opinion on what a ` good deal ' looks like so it 's pointless to talk about without getting down to details . 
  i 'm guessing it 'll be something like ceta . 
  no reason why not seeing as it 's a bog standard trade deal , no harm in that for the eu . 
  now you face rising unemployment because you 've just decimated an entire industry . 
  you have to create new jobs to replace them and retrain everyone . 
  people will need to move from rural areas to urban ones as you 've just destroyed the main source of rural jobs . 
  in the mean time you 've made your country dependent on another for its food . 
  if that relationship were ever to sour you 're left begging your neighbors for a replacement . 
  this puts you in a weak bargaining position resulting in worse deals for your country , and even when you secure a deal it can still be used as political leverage to put you in a compromising position . 
  of course you can do all that , but it 's not all roses . 
  it comes with downsides and those downsides are n't always worth a cheaper price . 
  personally i 'd rather eat the 30 % and keep my own industry intact , and if another country can compete with me * fairly * in the same market then that 's great . 
   it 's in everyones interests to have tarrif free trade that 's not always true . 
  simple example , one country subsidizes its agriculture industry allowing it to sell the same products 30 % cheaper . 
  in a free trade arrangement that could end up destroying the agriculture industry in the other country . 
  how do you compensate that ? 
  with a tariff . 
  see the current us/canada trade spat over softwood lumber for instance . 
  people have this oversimplified view of trade deals , in reality they 're hugely complicated and only work when both sides agree to a common set of rules . 
  those rules usually create most of the problems during negotiations . 
  it 's a major reason why being * in * the single market is not the same as having a trade deal . 
  inside the single market everyone plays by the same rules by definition , and that makes it piss easy to move goods and services around . 
  not to be confused with being pissed up , taking the piss , pissing off or pissing about . 
  there 's also the [ peter principle .

  chance, 
  foreign viruses stealing the jobs of hardworking british viruses . 
  no more i say !, 
  no as eu citizens they 're covered by spanish health care , the money is later reimbursed to spain by the uk gov. 
  it 's an important difference because that arrangement ends with brexit , so it 's just one of the hundreds of things that will have to be re-negotiated . 
  she was actually practicing the trump handshake when things ... got out of hand . 
  that sounds like a great solution honestly . 
  all we need to do is convince libya , lebanon and turkey to keep the problem in their countries . 
  why have n't we done this yet ? 
  so your position is we should have bottle the refugees up in greece and bulgaria and let them sort it out ? 
  no they do n't . 
  they have exactly 3 safe places to go before they reach europe : turkey , lebanon and jordan . 
  and they stopped there for years before those countries got so swamped with refugees that they started spilling over . 
  lebanon alone took in over 1 million refugees from syria , in a country with a population of 5 million . 
  turkey took in almost 3 million . 
  jordan took in over a million . 
  the very next safe country to go to is a european country . 
  no , the way the question is worded confuses two different topics . 
  one is people not liking jews , the other is people not agreeing with israel 's policies . 
  the only reason to mix those two positions together into a single question is to trick people into agreeing with one position so you can present it as if they 're agreeing with the other one too . 
  either it was worded this way deliberately to skew the result or whoever conducted the poll is incompetent . 
  either way it 's worthless . 
   from the polish perspective , germany broke its own rules by accepting refugees into its country then expected other states to clean up and share the burden of their miscalculation . 
  what was the alternative ? 
  to bottle them up in greece and bulgaria ? 
  germany `` invited '' them further into europe because those countries would n't have been able to cope with all the refugees on their own . 
  it was an extraordinary situation that the existing rules were n't designed to handle . 
  the mistake we made was not tackling the problem sooner . 
  turkey was taking in millions of people for years before it suddenly became our problem too . 
  we should have done more to prevent it from spilling over . 
  but that 's not just on us , the entire western world was happy to ignore it . 
  i would n't say that . 
  a lot of eu officials who were n't involved in the negotiations started complaining about transparency once the public got involved , but the official eu position was that it 's normal for trade deals to be conducted behind closed doors . 
  and they were right , it 's always been normal . 
  what i 'm saying is i hope this is a step toward more transparency in negotiations in the future , and not just an ass-covering move for the brexit talks to ensure may 's government ca n't play the `` eu is n't being fair '' card too easily . 
  which is what it seems like to me . 
  would be nice if they believed in transparency when it comes to things like ttip too , or is that somehow different ? 
  it may after the election , until then merkel wo n't touch it . 
  thing is this situation needs both austerity and debt relief . 
  either one or the other is n't enough . 
  you need debt relief to give the country any hope of recovering and you need austerity to force change in fiscal policy so this does n't happen again in 10 years time . 
  that means responsibilities on * both * sides , a simple ` haircut ' is n't a solution . 
  you assume the interest of the citizens of the eu is not linked to the eu itself . 
  a * lot * of people would disagree with that , especially in germany . 
  a loss of trade ? 
  we can deal with that . 
  the end of the eu ? 
  that 's a major upset that could have dire consequences for the whole continent . 
  and whether the uk succeeds outside the eu is not important . 
  what 's important to people like juncker is that the uk has a less beneficial relationship with the eu than before . 
  that does n't rule out a mutually beneficial deal at all and it certainly does n't hinge on the uk doing poorly outside the eu . 
  nah , but one of the realities of being a `` sovereign nation '' is being sat at a table across from a union of 27 `` almost sovereign '' nations who will want a deal that works * for the eu * . 
  and the uk will want a deal that works * for the uk * . 
  this is called a negotiation . 
  there 's nothing vindictive about it , it happens all the time . 
  a trade deal is not some magic thing that only brings benefits . 
  the 're huge and complicated and the result of years of hard ** negotiations ** . 
  i 'll give you this if you give me that , this stipulation hurts my industy 's competitiveness in this sector so you 'll have to compensate that with this other stipulation here and on and on and on . 
  to take just one really obvious example : the eu has strict regulations on gmos . 
  the uk , being outside the eu , can decide they 're not bothered with gmos and not regulate them so much . 
  well shit , now we need a stipulation in the trade treaty mandating oversight and trade regulations to make sure food imports from the uk do n't bypass eu laws . 
  is that part of a ` bad deal ' or a ` good deal ' ? 
  who knows . 
  it 's just one of thousands of things that did n't matter before ( since we were all part of a common market with a common set of rules ) that will have to be ** negotiated ** now . 
  the political factors * on both sides * only complicate things further . 
  anyone who thinks this is going to be a quick win-win deal is seriously deluded . 
  we may eventually get there but it 's going to be hard times ahead for the next 5 years minimum . 
  it 's like people are shocked that ripping up 30 years of agreements in just 2 years could have negative consequences for all involved . 
  that 's a pretty cynical way of looking at it . 
  by investing in those with less than the average you move the average up , because at the end of the day we 're all deeply connected through the eu . 
  when a country like romania does better economically we profit from that too . 
  by strengthening individual members you strengthen the whole bloc . 
  this spirit of partnership is what the eu is about . 
  it 's the reason we * all * have to put up with certain responsibilities and not just benefits . 
  even those `` less than average '' economies have responsibilities in exchange for the benefits they 're receiving .
