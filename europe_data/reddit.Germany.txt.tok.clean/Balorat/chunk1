we did master the art of bread especially [ laugengeb\u00e4ck ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysaqtdc-y2g ), 
  nope , we had adenauer for 14 years , kohl for 16 , merkel for nearly 11 years and counting, 
  since 1970 there is [ tatort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatort ) the longest-running german tv-drama and still going strong , especially if you have a tatort team in or near the town you 're living in and you know the places they visit ( ballauf/schenk ftw ! ) . 
  then there are a lot of great german documentaries , too many to name them all . 
  as to scifi , germany was one of the three countries , next to gb and canada where [ lexx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lexx ) was produced . 
  as to talkshows , imo the better ones to take a look at would be `` 3 nach 9 '' ( monthly ) , `` unter den linden ( every monday ) and the `` presseclub '' ( every sunday ) . 
  you mean the [ ** b ** raunschweigisches ** l ** andes ** m ** useum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/braunschweigisches_landesmuseum ) ? 
  you 're right it really is a gift , 
  go to cologne and visit all the breweries there, 
  yeah i mean we could simply use 1 april 1815 his birth , without him germany would probably look very different, 
  well you could also go with september , 9 ad : the battle of teutoburg forest , which left a whole lot of what is now germany free from roman rule . 
  or 2 february 962 , otto gets crowned . 
  or may and october 1648 , the signing of the peace of westphalia and let 's not forget : 21 march 1871 , after forming the german empire , otto von bismarck becomes its first ( and one of the greatest ) chancellor, 
  having been to enough aldi nord stores i have to say i 'm glad i live in the southern part of aldi, 
  oktoberfest in munich, 
  good riddance . 
  do you really have to ask ? 
  like napalm in the morning . 
  i agree with my neighbours and that british fellow , it 's the us . 
   do you feel any connection with americans with your ethnicity ? 
  yeah , assuming laughter is a connection . 
  simple rule of thumb , the more to the east you go the prettier the women become . 
   great education , healthcare , now i know you 're trolling, 
  that 's not a meme , that 's a fact, 
  when it comes to philosophy , whitehead was right when he said  the safest general characterization of the european philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to plato . 
  as to science , as we called it natural philosophy in the days of old , those footnotes are now the shoulders of giants . 
  as newton said :  if i have seen further , it is by standing on the shoulders of giants . 
   bavarians are n't even able to speak proper german at least their gibberish is more akin to your gibberish than anything else . 
  nope bavarians are northern austrians . 
  we too would like to pretend bavaria does n't exist , but sadly we 're not all prussians around here . 
  can a fact also be a stereotype ? 
  there is a mental institution not that far away from where i live , if they want they can start their saving there . 
  next to k\u00fcrten and of course the guy who is going to make sausages out of you , or the raf and nsu , there is always the [ hinterkaifeck murders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hinterkaifeck_murders ) . 
  in the middle of nowhere in bavaria , a family of five and their maid were murdered on their farm , the case is still unsolved going on 95 years now . 
  i do n't think we look upon friedrich ii as a conqueror . 
  i mean he did solve the whole crusade business diplomatically , there is a reason he is called stupor mundi and not the conqueror or something . 
  unless of course you 're talking about the other well known friedrich ii , whom we generally give the sobriquet * the great * to differentiate him from the hrr friedrich ii or [ all those other friedrich ii 's we 've had ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_ii . ) . 
  he led prussia to become a european power , which in turn helped his successor to finally unite germany , his idea about the king being the first servant of the state was n't a bad one in his time . 
  overall i would say we still ( or once again depending on who you ask ) feel good about him . 
  i on the other hand did n't know he was successful in france , i thought he was only somewhat known in the dach countries . 
  i 'm going with the rest in asking : who ? 
  and before anyone else googles him he 's a swiss singer , who became somewhat known in german speaking countries during the ndw days/craze as the singer of the band grauzone basically a one-hit-wonder around the song [ eisb\u00e4r ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhtxqvalipo ) . 
  but at least in germany , his only place in the charts was # 68 for his album carcassonne in 1993 . 
  he is still pretty successful in his home country though . 
  okay , as an outsider it just seems to me you treat it as a religion, 
  for you and me that 's correct but they are known as such in the states . 
  there is scientology . 
  but whether you can call them a religion is somewhat debatable . 
  who cares about one silly little civil war on nearly the other side of the world ? 
  around here we call that tuesday . 
  native singer at the moment ? 
  i fear it 's probably [ her ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haect-serhk ) and yes she sings mostly in german . 
   or swimming whatever you do , do not go swimming in the rhine . 
  you will most likely die , your family will be sad and in general there are better ways to not have to work anymore . 
   zensursurla it 's been a while since i heard [ that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4vbdusj7pk ) last, 
  in a way it 's german tradition since otto i named the archbishop of mainz archchancellor, 
  who ? 
  no idea but as to when , iirc she said she would retire after the coming legislative period , which would mean that kohl stays on top when it comes to the longest reign as chancellor but she would overtake adenauer . 
  [ amerika ist wunderbar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm ), 
  would n't it be easier to ask the americans which town names they have taken from us . 
  you 'll find a lot of german city names over there . 
  washington dc was burned by the brits in that little war of theirs , why is it still the capital ? 
  london burned ( at least once ) and it 's still the capital . 
  having your capital destroyed by something or the other does n't invalidate it as your capital , it just means that there are a new opportunities in the real estate market . 
  i 'd say have fun learning it and good luck once you get to our articles : [ der , die , das ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uphi5xn_q5c ), 
  the only reason i see to use a vpn would be to access the iplayer for instance and stuff like that , which of course i do n't do because that would be illegal . 
  the reasons one goes to war seldom have anything to do with the costs in human lives and human suffering as for those the reasons do n't matter but they have a lot to do with how the rest of the world reacts to that war . 
   privatization of oil in favour of american companies is what happened in iraq right after the invasion . 
  and i would never say that the reasons the us went to war ( and what they did once they were in country ) were any good but the reason russia went to war is a lot worse . 
  the us currently does n't wage war to expand their territory , they do n't want a piece of land in afghanistan or iraq . 
  russia on the other , last i checked , sees crimea as their own now, 
  i 've never seen all four of them with painted faces , back in ye olden days when i went myself ( i always carried the star so i had less to memorise ) we had one ( melchior ) whose face got painted black but that was it . 
  in the last decade ? 
  probably the g20 protests in hamburg a few weeks ago , i do n't really remember anything bigger than that . 
  though the protests around the g8 summit in heiligendamm 2007 were big as well . 
  for some probably like [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.taz.de/picture/2150232/948/bildschirmfoto_2017-07-21_um_092307.png ) [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pam72w-_lq0 ), 
  pah asia is just an european peninsula . 
  but we already had a blood sacrifice so we should be good by now , most call it world war 1 and 2 , some even the second thirty years ' war . 
  if that 's not a blood sacrifice i do n't know what else could be . 
  in that order : latin , english , ( ancient ) greek , ( biblical ) hebrew , french . 
  when you come to a gymnasium and start your secondary education you can choose which of the two english or latin you start with first , knowing in two years you 'll have the other one anyway.two years after that you can choose , in my case between greek , french . 
  two years after that you can choose again , though i 'm not sure which languages it was , iirc hebrew , french , spanish and something else . 
  i had the chance to start hebrew a year prior so i could choose two languages basically but i dropped french after just a year . 
  as to quality of teaching , my latin teacher was an ass hole but a good teacher , my english teachers were mostly just bad , in greek i had my old latin teacher at first but soon got a new one who was n't just a good teacher but also a nice human being . 
  in hebrew our teacher often corrected dutch exam papers ( she also taught dutch at the university ) during our exams which enabled us to swap our papers between each other to get good grades . 
  my french teacher was so bad i decided to drop the course after just a year . 
  he is one of the few people out there who knew how to sell shit in a way that people even these days still think it 's gold . 
  he was pretty bad at his job but by god he could sell it . 
   except the capital ? 
  but there is a reason berlin 's slogan for a long time under its mayor wowereit was : berlin , poor but sexy . 
  football , football and football and on the places following come those lesser sports like basketball , handball , swimming , cycling , hockey , skiing , hunting ( if you count it as a sport ) . 
   we only have written history from romans that used longer-lasting methods to write on . 
  and of those the most famous one ( and more or less recognised as german ) would be arminius who in 9 ad brought rome its greatest defeat in the battle of the teutoburg forest by erasing two legions from history whose numbers ( xvii and xix ) were never used again . 
  but the earliest would probably be the leaders of the migrating germanic tribes fighting rome in northern italy during the cimbrian war in 113 to 101 bc . 
  in the end the tribes lost completely . 
  in the same vein you could see brennus , who captured rome in 387 bc , as the earliest historical figure of the french , seeing as his tribe the senones came from a region that would centuries after brennus ' death become known as france . 
  but i hope that at least in catalonia they have a plan going in unlike a certain island we know that still does n't seem to have a plan, 
  if catalonia wants to secede from spain let them , i just hope their divorce works better than the british one from the eu . 
  yeah but outside of south germany you wo n't find it in your normal supermarket and of course [ amazon ] ( https://www.amazon.de/almdudler-28010-original-kr\u00e4uterlimonade-pet/dp/b01g8b3pla/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1501137363&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=almdudler ),
