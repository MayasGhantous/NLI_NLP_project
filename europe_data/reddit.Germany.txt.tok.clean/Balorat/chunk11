  to be fair before the last election our pirate party reached 15 % in polls too and where are they now ? 
  not only did n't they get into the bundestag in '13 but last i heard one of their head honchos was arrested for murder not so long ago . 
  there is a reason gibraltar is a british overseas territory, 
  which is good as 3 ( +1 ) of the top ten countries with the [ most diplomatic missions worldwide ] ( https://www.lowyinstitute.org/global-diplomacy-index/country_rank.html ) are in the eu . 
  france with 267 ( as # 2 ) , germany with 218 ( # 8 ) and spain with 212 ( # 10 ) and then there is of course the uk with 236 ( # 5 ) . 
  and before you ask the country with the most missions is of course the us with 270 . 
  do any of those guys actually have a chance to get anywhere near to political power ? 
  i mean could they actually change the course of their respective countries after the elections . 
  for instance petry wo n't be able to do it even if her party climbs over the 5 % hurdle . 
  you 're right . 
  i did not see that . 
   `` the party is polling at nearly 15 percent , ahead of some mainstream parties , they 're right in so far as the afd gets nearly [ 15 percent ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/ ) . 
  as to being 15 % ahead of some mainstream parties ... 
  if they see the party of bible-abiding christians that get around .1 % of the votes as mainstream they 're right as well . 
  did n't you guys have an advertisement about making new swedes a while ago or was it denmark ? 
   so unless one party gets a mayority of the votes ( did this ever happen ? ), 
  the highest percentage of votes for `` one '' party we 've ever had was the '57 election with 50,2 % for the cdu/csu under adenauer . 
  there really is a party that wants that but they only have 6k member while there a 12 million people living in bavaria . 
  and that party has next to no chance to get anywhere near a seat in the state parliament . 
  really they made a video about this nonsense, 
  russia is the one country that you do not attack except [ you 're the mongols ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vp5wf42.gif ), 
   ford fiesta yeah the car is in its sixth generation by now, 
   karl marx lived and worked for most of his life in england  ww1 we were n't exactly the only ones responsible for that shit  euro crisis last i checked the southern countries did a good job falling to pieces on their own and as for the rest the us banks and their collapse played a big role in starting that shit too  refugee crisis the refugees would have come either way, 
  and who would pay for the whole thing if we 're out of the picture ? 
  airbus or rather its parent company the airbus group ( the former eads ) is owned in equal parts by france and germany ( 11 % ) and various other european countries . 
  walls work as long as they 're not standing in the way of the true american hero and his [ long search ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkvx45wyeq ), 
   germany 's gabriel says eu break-up no longer unthinkable but sigi becoming chancellor still is, 
  but does n't he know that all is going to be awesome and that britain will totally and easily make new trade agreements so they do n't need the single market ... 
  is n't it rather a map of countries that need to get their act together and make haste for some polish real estate ? 
  they were transported to get chocolate, 
  so again a grand coalition ? 
  the fdp should really get their act together . 
  which is not a newspaper, 
  i would guess that it 's the latter on too, 
  there is a reason it needed a american newspaper to print that story , because no german newspaper takes the bayernpartei even serious and rightly so . 
  i mean ukip has 30k members , the bayernpartei only 6k . 
  i know of waffles , fries and a certain king and his own personal african backyard , and of course there is always the [ shortcut to france ] ( https://hugelolcdn.com/i/195126.png ), 
  czech republic is the official long form , czechia is the short form, 
  you do n't want us triggered , bad things happen when we 're [ triggered ] ( https://i.imgur.com/krffwmv.png ), 
  big sister ? 
  i think op has some explaining to do . 
   the german state raises `` catholic '' taxes ... 1 % of your earnings before taxes . 
  and does so for a number of other organisations for which the state gets a few percents of those taxes, 
  i hope swabian german is one of those 7 that are in trouble , the world can very much live without it . 
  the eu would think : good thing we did n't let them join ... 
  if by suspicious you mean neo-nazis then yeah , of course . 
  which is why back when dd and rwe still played together in the same league , games between the two were well `` interesting '' . 
  why only 18 ? 
  should be 88 just to be safe . 
  of course dd and rwe both played in the 3rd league while the guys from essen play in what now fifth league or something ? 
  when it comes to dynamo there is only one rwe that matters , even though they 're no longer in the same league . 
  even better/worse if he had done it while dynamo played against rwe , he would have found himself in the company of a lot of new friends fast who would have gladly bought him a round or five . 
  he should have done it while dynamo played and he probably would have gotten away with it unharmed . 
  and i 'm guessing the reason no german newspaper is talking about it is because there is a big conspiracy and the government forcing everyone to be silence about her . 
  that 's probably why she is talking to rt as well , i mean government bias is bad we really should talk to a russian international television network funded by the russian government about it . 
   germans avoid change . 
  [ no experiments !, 
  ] ( https://www.hdg.de/lemo/img_hd/bestand/objekte/biografien/adenauer-konrad_plakat_1993-04-085_cdu_paul-aigner_cc-by-sa-30-de.jpg ) it has been true in adenauer 's days and it 's still true today . 
  yeah that could be posted in / r/accidentalrenaissance, 
  apple is one of if not the biggest of them , there is a lot of money in there . 
  and if it works with/for apple , especially considering the army of lawyers they have at their beck and call , it works for them all . 
  did n't say it was , the post was just an fyi . 
  just so everyone is clear on this , the friedrich-ebert-foundation is associated with the spd , as friedrich ebert , who also was the first president of the weimar republic , lead the spd during the war and early republic days . 
  obivously you ca n't learn how we make fun of you , 
  tl ; dw : just an ad to go to uk.gov for any questions regarding your passport without having to pay for the answers . 
  oh , i did n't see a link to there on the german page when i looked, 
  no he means states as in : germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen states , though berlin , hamburg and bremen are `` only '' city states, 
  is n't ireland part of the british isles ? 
  do you see ard/zdf as government media agencies as well ? 
  for germany there is [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 ) as an news organisation that publishes in english . 
  apart from that [ spon international ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/ ) translates some of their articles into english . 
  but afaik both major german daily newspapers ( faz & sz ) do n't have an english section and neither does die zeit . 
  and to be honest i doubt it will look any better anywhere in europe outside the british isles . 
  the m\u00f6venpick group probably wants to open up a few hotels there ... 
  op is a bot, 
  compared to alt even gaffel is still beer, 
  talks about k\u00f6lsch and shows a picture of the gaffel brewery ... that 's like talking about cars and showing the lada factory, 
  they really should have ask how much the fish is first . 
  now they have to pay for it . 
  op has hair on his ass , he 's clearly man enough to ask for himself, 
  the price of freedom is a [ buck o'five ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe8bgqzykte ) , that 's 88 euro cents at the moment ... take it or leave it . 
  and only 24 minutes in ... nice work, 
  communism is the very definition of failure . 
  is there a reason they did n't simply translate it into english ( like the german version ) or at least as close as possible and instead went with a complete different lyrics ? 
  to be fair greece received marshall plan aid as well to the tune of 376 million dollar and last i checked they 're not doing so well, 
   post a link with personal information on a site with 1\u00a01/2 million subscribers . 
  you might not have done the research yourself but you did make it available to a broader audience and that is still doxxing . 
  so are we in the business of doxxing now ? 
  so basically g\u00fclen did it . 
  but let 's face it all the countries they fought through were pushovers anyway . 
  i mean with the exception of greece of course as you guys fell long before that after a long and valiant struggle . 
  imho you can forget the rest , they all pale in comparison to the iron chancellor . 
  can we do write-in candidates ? 
  because you missed otto eduard leopold , prince of bismarck , duke of lauenburg . 
  coming down they turned the tide, 
  it 's actually not illegal or at least not [ everywhere ] ( http://www.wsa-koeln.wsv.de/aktuelle_informationen/baden_im_rhein.html ) but yeah speaking from experience here , you really should n't do it . 
  to be fair though swimming in the isar is easy , swimming in the rhine or the danube though would really show ones dedication for ones job . 
  hm before we had balls but no coffee , now we have coffee but apparently no balls ... maybe those brits are really on to something with their tea . 
  iirc you guys tried that once and you did n't even make it past vienna , though at least you left your coffee there . 
  and that 's the way she likes and wants it .
