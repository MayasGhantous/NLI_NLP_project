  nope we take the lift to skip the easy treks so we can directly start the hardcore hikes higher up the mountain . 
   do they have bad politicians ? 
  in a way that 's it . 
  they have no one who can stand against merkel , though on the other hand the cdu/csu has no one who can really succeed her . 
  in january/february they got the gottkanzler boost , on reddit that became / r/the _ schulz which in turn led to things like [ das schulzzuglied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rrg3skt3po ) . 
  but schulz could n't deliver on the hopes and eventually the fuel for that boost ran out . 
  [ hello , vienna calling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtlsjrmx5ic ), 
  in a foreign field he lay lonely soldier , unknown grave on his dying words he prays tell the world of [ paschendale ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc_jxfyxmnc ), 
  the title is a bit misleading . 
  while it is one of if not the widest tunnels of its kind and probably the first to accommodate sea going vessels ( as in freighters and luxury liners and the like ) , it 's by no means the first boat tunnel , that would be the [ malpas tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malpas_tunnel ) in france built in 1679 . 
  you mean 15 years ago , as the year is 2017 not 2027 and the disaster happened in 2002 . 
  btw in a month and a day , 29 years ago , august 28 , 1988 the ramstein air show disaster happened which was , with 70 dead and around a thousand injured , the deadliest air show accident in history until sknyliv . 
   i do n't understand the point of it . 
  you do n't understand the point of satire/comedy ? 
  in that case i feel sorry for you . 
  iirc it did n't though funk.net for which the creators the bohemian browser ballett `` work '' for is funded by both ard and zdf ( the two big german public broadcaster ) but it 's not a tv channel instead a youtube/facebook/whatever internet thing, 
   created by merica in germany, 
  do n't tell me you do n't have brothels in sweden or maybe australia, 
   originated in nazi germany which is what counts , well not necessarily the nazi part, 
   fanta to quote the [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fanta )  the drink originated in nazi germany under a trade embargo for coca-cola ingredients in 1940 . 
  well , til orangina is actually french . 
  i always thought it was belgian or maybe dutch, 
  i think the newer ones have that now , though it could be different from state to state as police is a matter of each state and not controlled by the federal government . 
  do n't they do it now over twitter by giving random swedes control over the @sweden twitter account for a period of time ? 
   fastnacht found the heretic, 
  is he saying that or are there actual facts backing that up ? 
  wanting to be in the same club as those nazis in germany and the netherlands ... 
  does n't that make turkey a nazi sympathiser ? 
   why not have a monarch ? 
  because the last monarch led us into ww1 , no thank you . 
  and in other news , your question is better suited for / r/askeurope, 
  let 's be honest here i doubt there was ever any real push to make turkey a member . 
  damn those greens nearly as many pages as cdu/spd and fdp combined , do they really have to compensate so much ? 
  nope the anthem is based on ode to joy from the final movement of beethoven 's ninth symphony , but it does not have lyrics . 
  we 're only on # 23 ? 
  you 've posted the whole playlist and not just [ die wacht am rhein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cydp41vv0js ) . 
  and auferstanden aus ruinen is n't exactly a war song . 
  and die wacht am rhein is more a political statement/song than a war song, 
   he actually likes his kids he especially likes his [ eldest daughter ] ( https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-ivanka-trump-creepiest-most-unsettling-comments-a-roundup-a7353876.html ), 
  so trump having 5 children makes him a better politician ? 
  in what way does petry have more skin in the game than the current crop of german politicians ? 
  down with capitalism -- sent from my iphone, 
   not actually that alcoholic . 
  so it 's basically water ? 
  wait estonians actually drink fermented bread ? 
  that brings the idea of liquid bread to a whole other level , bavarians should cut a slice off of that . 
  interesting side note , at least iirc , in iceland they burned mostly ( if not only ) men instead of women, 
  do n't tell us what to do, 
   erdo\u011fan : [ ... ] many german newspapers , for example , have written that tayyip erdo\u011fan is a dictator . 
  well , to that , i would ask : how does this outlet define a dictator ? 
   zeit : are you asking why the german public sees you as a dictator ? 
  because in no other country in the world are there as many journalists behind bars as there are in turkey , more than 150 . 
  because german journalists like deniz y\u00fccel and me\u015fale tolu are in prison , and nobody knows why . 
  y\u00fccel is even in solitary confinement . 
  because tens of thousands of people lost their jobs because they are suspected of having participated in last summer 's attempted coup . 
  because your intelligence agency has spied on german parliamentarians . 
  those are a few of the reasons why you enjoy such a reputation . 
  yeah i 'm going with die zeit on this one ... 
  so instead of having to listen to mediocre music the crowd decides to sing good music instead . 
  good for them . 
  in us eyes we 're all on the left . 
  nope t_d is telling us we 're already fucked and living basically under shakira law, 
  yeah . 
  the gdr did n't really do the whole preservation of historical monuments thing especially when it came to churches . 
  basically the only thing they did was to declare it a monument and leave it as it is . 
  you see that luther statue there ? 
  that 's how the place looked like in [ 1958 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/bundesarchiv_bild_183-60015-0002%2c_dresden%2c_denkmal_martin_luther%2c_frauenkirche%2c_ruine.jpg ), 
   we 've lost thousands fighting for freedom in europe . 
  so did the rest of europe as well though ... 
  except of course the swiss . 
   what did continental countries do to help ? 
  fighting for their life against the german war machine or being allied to said war machine ? 
  except the swiss of course ... 
  they 're to blame . . 
  nah she voted against it out of her personal belief , which she has stated before the vote and to not anger her base . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are some fundamental preachers in the states that take the flood in berlin as a sign that god did n't want the vote on gay marriage to happen , because that makes way more sense than global warming, 
  it 's more like speech that is used to incite others to violence against others or something along those lines . 
  `` hate speech '' if you want to call it that was always against the law , that 's nothing new . 
  the only thing this new law does is to force facebook to remove posts that fall under that , but it does n't change anything regarding `` hate speech '', 
   do you have a copy/link of the law ? 
  yeah but only in [ german ] ( http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/130/1813013.pdf ), 
   so lets talk about germany 's newly passed law making it illegal to criticize religion such as islam ( hate speech according to the government ) as well as to criticize the refugee crisis . 
  they are criminalizing posts on facebook and other social media sites . 
  i 'm not sure which law you 're on about but the netzdg does n't do that , the point of that law is to force facebook and the like to remove posts with a clear criminal content within 24 hours after they 're reported , while less clear posts are to be removed within seven days . 
  should facebook and the like do n't comply they get fined . 
  i 'm not saying there are n't enough problems with this thing , but let 's criticise the actual law and not some fantasy version . 
   the people of germany did not vote for this . 
  yeah it 's not like the majority of germans wanted this or anything ... [ oh wait ] ( http://www.antidiskriminierungsstelle.de/shareddocs/aktuelles/de/2017/20170112_umfrage_lsb.html ) ... 
  she had already great chances of being reelected before that , the only thing that changed is with which party she is able to work together after the election, 
   this is exactly what this legislation does and it 's very disturbing . 
  that 's not important , if you link an article you either post the exact title or the correct translation of it . 
  your opinion belongs to the comment section , not the title . 
  next time translate the actual title ( bundestag/federal diet passes controversial facebook-law ) and do n't editorialise it, 
  sure , but now you can see who in the union voted for it, 
  if you want to know how each party voted , look [ here ] ( https://www.bundestag.de/parlament/plenum/abstimmung/abstimmung?id=486 ), 
   fight for a place at merkel 's table . 
  seeing the polls , i 'd say that 's what this election is all about anyway, 
  though was it really a topic before ? 
  the chancellor is a member of parliament too, 
   he can refuse to sign yes and doing that is generally called a veto , just because karlsruhe can overrule him does n't change that .
