   is this merely a formality or can the president refuse to sign the law ? 
  what happens then ? 
  is known when it 'll be presented to him for signing ? 
  he can veto it , though afaik there are only eight times when a president actually vetoed a law that was presented to him . 
  you see he wants ireland united as a state of germany , having the proper german name irland . 
   who owns the non-catholic cemetery ? 
   the non-catholic cemetery is private . 
  its management is the responsibility of an association formed by 15 embassies in rome which have nationals buried in the cemetery . 
  the embassies are : australia - canada - denmark - germany - finland - greece - ireland - netherlands - norway - russian federation - south africa - sweden - switzerland - united kingdom - united states of america . 
   how is the cemetery funded ? 
   the cemetery is entirely self-supporting through the fees charged for the concession of plots for burial , and from the annual maintenance payments that concession-holders pay . 
  it also relies on private and public contributions and grants to pay for essential conservation and maintenance work.on private and public contributions and grants to pay for essential conservation and maintenance work .

  why do you think hitler was the way he was ? 
  every country that is n't germany ... all those pesky speed limits everywhere ... 
  if you do that poland really ca n't into space ... 
   you do n't have a very good alternative to be fair , for the us that has never been a reason not to do it . 
  in germany we have a problem with road cracking open or `` blow up '' as it 's called due to heat on roads that were built in the 1980s . 
  there the concrete slabs that were used back then , expand due to the heat and once neighbouring slabs meet each other they crack open without any warning . 
  no idea why he wears stuff like [ this ] ( http://bilder.bild.de/fotos-skaliert/prinz-protz--wird-dieser-mann-wirklich-koenig-von-thailand--200050771-46951394/3,w=596,q=high,c=0.bild.jpg ) when visiting his girlfriend in bavaria , maybe because at home he has to follow the customs and wear '' [ normal ] ( http://bilder.bild.de/fotos-skaliert/maha-vajiralongkorn-200362520-51476066/2,w=649,q=high,c=0.bild.jpg ) '' stuff . 
  to be fair the guy dresses like an [ idiot ] ( http://bilder.bild.de/fotos/der-thai-koenig-mit-lady-goi-200362645-51477058/bild/2.bild.jpg ) whenever he comes to germany, 
  `` german women , german loyalty , german wine and german song '' does n't have the same pathos or whatever you want to call it as `` unity and justice and freedom for the german fatherland ! '', 
  the latter really shows what the federal republic really stands for . 
  imo the second stanza describes germans , the third describes germany . 
  as to heil dir im siegerkranz , the melody is the same as god save the queen but the lyrics are different of course , as was the case with a number of hymns and national anthems especially before the war . 
  lichtenstein 's national anthem [ oben am jungen rhein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjysj81omgs ) still uses the melody . 
  yeah but nrw was never a sovereign country ( more or less ) unlike the saarland, 
  german empire ( 1871-1918 ) - no official one , though you 'll often hear the emperor 's hymn and former prussian anthem : [ heil dir im siegerkranz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cfzfbtk9i8 ) weimar republic ( 1918 -- 1933 ) - [ deutschlandlied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzosnwkhsq ) german reich ( 1933-1945 ) - deutschlandlied and basically horst-wessels-lied germany ( 1945-1949 ) - none saarland ( 1947 -- 1956 ) - [ saarlandlied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-asbftt-saq ) german democratic republic ( 1949-1990 ) - [ auferstanden aus ruinen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2_okmz1vaa ) federal republic of germany ( 1949 -1990 ) - deutschlandlied ( only the third stanza is sung on official occasions ) federal republic of germany ( 1991 - ) - third stanza of the [ deutschlandlied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgdtm5qzkb4 ), 
  why does this link to your removed reddit post and not to the actual [ site ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/commission/brexit-negotiations/negotiating-documents-article-50-negotiations-united-kingdom_en ) ? 
  it worked for him and seeing as the cdu is at [ 36-39 % ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/ ) atm and way in front of the spd , it seems to work for mutti as well . 
  how often is this going to be reposted ? 
  do n't you know that all germans hate germany ? 
  really get with the program . 
  i 'm shaking in fear over here . 
  you could n't fit more buzzwords in there ? 
  sad !, 
  the usual t_d bullshit, 
  all i know of sweden is what die \u00c4rzte taught me , and being the best band in the world they are most assuredly completely right about it : [ jag \u00c4lskar sverige ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6_5qaawric ) why ca n't every country be like sweden ? 
  the swedish one is a problem in germany as well, 
  why the guys from the afd doing a great job dragging themselves in the mud on their own . 
  how can we know whether he is true slav when boris is n't squatting in his addidas tracksuit ? 
   i 'm from the uk , born in 1995 making me an eu citizen from birth . 
  the referendum vote was devastating because i 've always been proud of being a part of the eu , despite it being far from perfect . 
  you are and will still be a citizen of the uk until you decide to give that citizenship up in favour of another country . 
   the vote completely divided the country , old vs young , educated vs non-educated , urban vs rural and the majority who voted leave was small , 52 % . 
  leaving a very significant majority unhappy so ? 
  that 's something the uk has to deal with on their own , may decided to follow the majority and go forward with article 50 . 
  and for everyone outside the uk , that 's what counts . 
   the idea of stripping someone of their citizenship ( without them acquiring foreign citizenship or renouncing their own ) seems almost nazi to me . 
  small problem there , when the nazis took away someones german citizenship , they had no citizenship anymore . 
  the uk decided , freely , to leave which in theory should include giving up the eu citizenship , but you still have a citizenship , the uk one . 
  though what will happen regarding the eu citizenship of uk citizens is n't clear yet  if i was born an eu citizen , how can the decision of others take that away from me ? 
  because you and i live in a democracy , in your case the majority has decided to leave , so you 'll leave with all that entails , leaving behind your eu citizenship when you leave the eu should n't really come to a surprise now . 
  he 's new here , cut him some slack, 
  for everyone coming over from t_d , those are of course not the real numbers but the ones the man ( or in our case the woman ) wants us to know . 
  the numbers you 've come up with are without a doubt the right ones . 
  and you probably can provide me with sources for that right ? 
  i mean real ones and not infowars or breitbart . 
  good !, 
  that 's what i want to hear . 
  when t_d says we do , it means we do . 
  get with the fucking program !, 
  did this actually air in russia or is it only available online there ? 
  go to youtube and watch all the great gysi vs lammert videos , they 're awesome, 
  let 's wait and see what will happen shall we , but to be fair if i have to choose between an article of one of the biggest newspapers in nz or the word of some redditor , i 'm going with the kiwis . 
  quoting the article :  historians in australia and turkey told the guardian the `` refurbishment '' could be part of the erdo\u011fan administration 's moves to cast gallipoli as part of a clash between jihadi defenders and invading crusaders on the shores of islam . 
   professor of history at the university of new south wales canberra peter stanley said the erasure of the purported atat\u00fcrk words reflected a `` new theocratic interpretation '' of the conflict in turkey . 
   `` because the erdo\u011fan government is in power , islamists are now in the ascendant - as the new gaba tepe interpretative centre [ at gallipoli ] shows . 
   `` it depicts turkey 's 86,000 gallipoli dead as `` martyrs '' , dying in a fight against christian invaders . '', 
  i 'm not sure whether you can actually call it `` just '' restoration, 
  it seems that * those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives * are no longer * lying in the soil of a friendly country * . 
  no it 's only meant for eu countries . 
  no country is ( or rather was ) legally bound to that agreement . 
  how would you go about enforcing that ? 
  as to china , i 'm pretty sure they do n't count as a developing country anymore and would n't receive any funds anyway . 
  and afaik those funds are for specific project that are being built in those countries . 
  there is always a lighthouse . 
  [ statement from president clinton on the passing of helmut kohl ] ( https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/statement-president-clinton-passing-helmut-kohl ), 
  and that 's why germany is the leader of the free world, 
  kohl served his guests saumagen and in germany you 'll eat what 's on the table . 
  becoming a honorary eu member state ? 
  we should all eat a saumagen in the memory of this great german and great european . 
  yeah apparently the [ sz ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/eil-helmut-kohl-ist-tot-1.2504404 ) is saying the same based on their own information . 
  atm it 's only bild that 's running with it though, 
  do n't forget the symphony was completed in austria * european pride intensifies even more *, 
  best track of europe, 
  so suing someone who broke the law makes you north korea ? 
  because that 's what they did , it is illegal to enter the closed parts of the catacombs . 
  there is even a police force that patrols the known and ( therefore ) closed entries to those parts . 
  if anything the city could probably sue them for the cost of the search team, 
  to be fair the holy see has diplomatic relations with nearly all countries in the world , except for afghanistan , saudi arabia ( though they 've begun working on it since 2007 ) , comoros , the maldives , oman , the prc , north korea , bhutan , botswana and tuvalu . 
  probably though i doubt you can get your hand on any official one that easily but the tunnels themselves are n't safe even if you have a guide or a map . 
  yeah the afd is loosing because of trump ... 
  it 's not like they 've been showing everyone in the last few months that they 're really basically nazis or anything, 
  that 's right they grow right next to the [ spaghetti trees ] ( http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spaghettitreesfeature03312015-970x545.jpg ), 
  i for one can live with this judgement, 
  there is a reason most of the tunnels are n't open for the public, 
  from top to bottom/blue to white very good good moderate unsatisfactory bad not rated and white means : no rating of the ecological conditions necessary, 
  the pope is already on [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/pontifex ) so it would n't be that big of a step,
