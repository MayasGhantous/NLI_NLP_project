   vatican city has the highest rate of catholic citizens in the world - 100 % . 
  the vatican has a unique approach when it comes to citizenship , you 're only a citizen there as long as you work there . 
  the vatican is not a member of the eu but is able to print its own [ euro coins ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/va.en.html ) with the head of the current pope on the obverse side , though during the period of sede vacante after the death of pope st. john paul ii , they also had the [ emblem of the apostolic chamber and the coat of arms of the camerlengo of the holy roman church ] ( http://img02.euro-muenzen.tv/vatican-1-euro-coin-2005-sede-vacante-mmv-2800440-146419316388007.jpg ) . 
  nowadays that is n't possible anymore as the rules were changed so that it 's either the design the state choose or the head of state , the coins will not be changed for temporary vacancies anymore . 
  the vatican has one of the oldest still existing libraries in the world , established in 1475 , they recently begun to [ digitize ] ( http://digi.vatlib.it/?ling=en ) their collection . 
  the [ vatican museums ] ( http://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en.html ) are ( again ) one of the oldest , one of the largest and one of the most visited museums in the world . 
  they have their own [ radio ] ( http://www.radiovaticana.va ) , [ newspaper ] ( http://www.osservatoreromano.va/de ) , [ police ] ( http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/struttura-del-governatorato/corpo-della-gendarmeria.html ) and of course [ army ] ( http://www.swissguard.va/content/guardiasvizzera/it.html ) . 
  the vatican also has its own [ observatory ] ( http://www.vaticanobservatory.va/content/specolavaticana/en.html ) in its newest form first built in the vatican itself in 1891 , which moved in the 1930s to the summer papal palace in castel gandolfo due to light pollution , and again in 2008 into the papal gardens there , the [ telescope ] ( http://www.vovatt.org ) itself commissioned in 1993 is situated on mount graham in southeast arizona , usa . 
  both of their current parliamentary leaders ( bartsch and wagenknecht ) were members of the sed , same goes for their former leader and now party chairman of the european left gregor gysi . 
  why are you posting a three year old article ? 
  you could always burn a bible or the tanakh and see what happens, 
  as prime minister juncker was there for francis ' inauguration . 
  yeah but he was only there due to the g7 meeting, 
  afaik the vatican does n't invite state leaders just for a state visit , but they also wo n't uninvite you if you choose to come , which is why robert mugabe is there at every big event like francis ' inauguration . 
  lol as if the afd has any chance of getting anywhere near to a position of power . 
  at this point the only question is whether they jump over the 5 % hurdle in the first place , for anything more you 'll need very hard drugs . 
  apparently you 're [ right ] ( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-usa-trump-iduskbn1902yp ), 
  apart from saudi arabia and israel , which single country has trump actually visited yet upon invitation ? 
  sure he was in brussels but only because nato is there and he was in italy because italy chairs the g7 this year . 
  [ what does the clock say ? 
  ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/11018494_199057720471513_1273602098_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=mtixmte3mjyzode1odkzodc3ng%3d%3d.2 ), 
  iirc that 's the second time just for the new grand tours season . 
   suffered no serious injury . 
  good for him but honestly how often does the hamster crash ? 
  we 're talking about germany here . 
  he said [ internal security ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brdg8a0j4je ) though, 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/09/lord-buckethead-elmo-and-mr-fish-finger-a-very-british-election ) , yes he was . 
   is there really an austrian children 's book story where a misbehaving child knocks over a dinner table and in return gets his thumbs cut off it 's german , both stories [ die geschichte vom daumenlutscher ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/82/8e/de/828edef9c29c493ba06d48ce4578475a.jpg ) / [ the story of the thumb-sucker ] ( https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/page-15-and-16.jpg ) ] and [ die geschichte vom zappel-phillip ] ( http://www.frankfurter-hauptfriedhof.de/image-namen/fabricius-struwwelpeter-geschichte.jpg ) / [ the story of the fidgety ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/fg868k/ad-guinness-c1930-nthe-story-of-fidgety-philip-lithograph-c1930-fg868k.jpg ) [ philip ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/b0m652/english-struwwelpeter-20-the-story-of-fidgety-philip-c-b0m652.jpg ) are found in der struwwelpeter ( shockheaded peter ) , published in 1844 . 
  the book is now seen as an illustration of many mental disorders in children, 
  why are children books like this or the ( at least ) equally famous [ struwwelpeter ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/82/8e/de/828edef9c29c493ba06d48ce4578475a.jpg ) from the other side of the border written in rhyme ? 
  we do n't really have options for online education around here , at least not ones that are recognised . 
  if you want your diploma you 'll have to go to night school/folk high school to get it . 
  they may have some parts of their courses online , but you will have to go there . 
  we already do : /, 
  there is a big difference between ** your ** million dollars and ** my ** million dollars though, 
  i wrote ** d ** ein kampf not ** m ** ein kampf there is a big difference between the two , the former is the right translation , the latter is the name of the book . 
  yeah it 's not like `` fight '' can only be translated to `` kampf '' . 
  and even then dein kampf would have worked , it would probably be different if it were a game based in/around ww2 or so but other than that ... 
  so what else is new ? 
  yeah but i had only the mail as an international example, 
  nah they 're quite serious but they 're closer to bild , daily mail and the like than more reputable newspapers like faz , sz , spiegel , ny times etc. 
  it 's the berliner kurier , do n't expect them to be mature . 
   his actual name . 
  it has n't been his family name since the family changed it a while back ... as in after the thirty-years war, 
  i for one bid adieu to our american overlords and welcome our new chinese overlords . 
  i mean functionally you 'll hear on the uppermost floor if someone drops his bag on the ground floor , which is not exactly great for libraries where you want silence . 
  the university library in erfurt has a similar design with an open space from top to bottom and it 's really hard to concentrate due to the noise `` thanks '' to that design decision . 
  it might work for a public library and it certainly looks good , but for a library that design is n't great . 
  and we should care what the uk has to say about what the eu is doing exactly why ? 
  we were the ones exporting the trumps in the first place . 
  why would we want him back now ? 
  where do you think the photographer is sitting, 
  that 's right !, 
  mutti always at [ w\u00f6rk ] ( https://i.imgur.com/zev1a9e.png ), 
  good for her , that 's one thing we do n't need to import from the us . 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  the member states own them, 
  for those interested the spot in germany is the b\u00fcchel air base . 
  as far as it 's known there are twenty bombs stored there . 
  since the bombs stored in rammstein were apparently removed in 2007 it 's as you can see the only base that still has nuclear weapons . 
  though b\u00fcchel has been the target of protests against nuclear weapons and their use ever since it became known that they 're stored there . 
  the latest started in march this year coinciding with the negotiation for the un nuclear-weapon-ban treaty . 
  wacken is the biggest heavy metal festival after all, 
  have you seen the crowd during a mass or any other event ? 
  heaven for pickpockets and the like, 
  ten years ago the corps of gendarmerie had 130 members but the italian police also patrols parts of vatican city , it has one of the highest crime rates in the world after all, 
  yep : semel catholicus , semper catholicus - once catholic , always catholic . 
  catholics , orthodox and even some protestants , for instance the evangelical church in germany venerate her as a saint ( or whatever the protestants call it ) . 
  and for the catholics the 13th of december is an obligatory memorial so you have celebrations there . 
  as for germany , afaik only in some parts of bavaria you have some sort of public celebration . 
  to be more precise : a list that for some unexplained reason starts in 2004 , nothing more . 
  it 's not like there have n't been any terror attacks before that, 
  only two words ? 
  pah !, 
  come back when your language has four word combinations, 
  by the power of the trump it shall be !, 
  those are mostly cairns in a region that is still not that populated , over the centuries the entrance gets blocked by stones/mud/earth / whatever and you wo n't find them that easily anymore , instead you just have a hill . 
  is that going to be reposted every other day now ? 
  found the heretic . 
  why go there to be ruled by a puppet if the russian puppeteer is far closer ? 
  but for both of them to work they need another partner as it stands now, 
  is n't it the fdp that want to reintroduce that shit ? 
  and you probably have a lot of proof for that kind of statement . 
  and if you had any idea of german politics you would have known that the c in their name has n't been a centre point for their politics in a long time, 
  found the guy who has no idea what the cdu actually stands for . 
  a hint , it 's not christian fundamentalism ... 
  in the case of germany it 's easy , if you live in germany and speak the language , you 're german , if not ... well you 're not , regardless of whether you ancestors might have come from germany . 
  how about we do n't do that, 
  the open autobahn , unlimited fuel and to see all those worthless american `` cars '' far behind in their rear mirror, 
  i 'm not sure if you 've heard but the german political landscape is a lot different than the american one . 
  for instance we have two good candidates in merkel and schulz , the us had none . 
  yeah that happens from time to time , last time afaik was in 2013 in [ giessen , hesse ] ( https://www.op-online.de/hessen/bomben-explosion-giessen-sprengsatz-zweiten-weltkrieg-detoniert-3018602.html ) thankfully no one was hurt but that is n't always the case . 
  as the article itself says in [ june 2010 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/10212890 ) , three people died and six were injured while trying to defuse one of those bombs then again in [ january 2014 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25594000 ) one man died when his digger disturbed one bomb , eight others were injured . 
  once the french election is over , they will come for the german one thinking the afd has a chance to get to power . 
  did you forget to switch to a throwaway this time ? 
  wear whatever you would wear on the other side of the pond  that 's probably way too canadian / american we could n't care less, 
  the two better ones probably belong to one of the ruling houses over there and you do n't want to mess with them, 
  back then it was more than a year between both elections now it 's only 4 months, 
  it serves as an indicator for the general election later that year , which is very much interesting for europe, 
  same here .
