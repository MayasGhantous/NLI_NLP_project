  to deal with another problem the oh so mighty us has created ? 
  nope we have our hands full with the one you created in the middle east . 
  no section of your population can claim refugee status , as long as that does n't change there are enough ways for an american to enter the us and gain citizenship here already , there do n't need to be any more . 
  he is without a doubt one of the great in german football , but , sadly being dead , he is n't as much talked about these days , unlike the ones you mentioned who are mostly still active in the sport in some form or other , or at least have been until very recently . 
  yeah rudi v\u00f6ller is great but i 'm not sure whether i would put him on the same level as those three . 
  if we just look at football and not what they might have done since , i would say in germany it 's the kaiser , the bomber and uns uwe , in other words [ franz beckenbauer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_beckenbauer ) , [ gerd m\u00fcller ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerd_m\u00fcller ) and [ uwe seeler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uwe_seeler ) . 
  incidentally the first two were both in the team that won the '74 world cup . 
  i have a table fan when it gets really hot , i do n't need any more air conditioning . 
  and unless it 's a very hot night , i turn it off . 
  i do n't even listen to german rap in my country ( unless it 's fettes brot or fanta4 ) let alone french , though to be fair i do n't listen to american rap either . 
  it 's old german or old high german whatever you want to call it, 
  you ca n't compare the two . 
  the idea of a unified germany is centuries old , for instance that 's what the first line of the first stanza of the song of the germans is all about : germany above all . 
  bismarck only brought this idea into being ( and threw out the undesirables ) . 
  the idea of a european unification in the vein of the european union on the other is only a modern idea , before the war a unified europe would have involved the conquest of the rest of europe by one country or another , france and germany tried it and failed . 
  but the main thing that is missing here , is that there is no notion of `` europe above all '' , that regardless of which state you may come from , be it portugal or latvia you are an european . 
  and no there has never been anything like the eu , it 's completely unique . 
  sure the german war decided who was german and who was austrian , or rather that austria is n't part of germany . 
  before that it was n't that clear . 
   germany had n't formed yet that does n't matter , people on both sides saw themselves as germans . 
  and as to the involvement of other powers , the main battle lines were drawn in the territory of the hre and mostly present day germany, 
  the thirty years ' war was a civil war , with german states on both sides . 
  it led to eight million dead but also to the first secular peace and the begin of the idea of sovereign state . 
  or just `` jung '' if you 're from cologne or thereabouts, 
  [ a damn fine cup of coffee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxwcq1dapw8 ), 
  in the case of hpv the german standing vaccination committee released a vaccination recommendation a few years back . 
  as to herpes , the austrian has the right of it . 
  the ball is round , 22 men chase it for 90 minutes and in the end the germans win . 
  while you could also chase it for [ 120 minutes ] ( https://youtu.be/yfl7rfjubns?t=8 ) , everything else you do with a ball is n't worth talking about . 
  i 'm not sure whether a political party falls under world view association . 
  but i would guess the humanist union could use this law if you were to go there and insult them or if you were to go to a meeting of vegetarians and begin butchering a cow in front of them or something . 
  and just yelling heil satan once would probably only get you thrown out , it would need to be more drastic like filming a porn there for example as apparently happened in austria . 
   do you sometimes find yourself calling your friend number one ? 
  sadly none of my friends watched it in english . 
  though the first season of x-files was hard , back then they had some hard accents in there , thankfully it got better over time . 
  as to recommendations , you could basically do the same and just watch the dubbed versions , it might even help if you already know what 's going on , having seen it in english before . 
  that way you know approximately what they 're saying and hear how you 'd say it in german . 
  as to real german tv shows , there are n't really any i would recommend apart from telenovelas and police procedurals we 're mostly watching dubbed stuff . 
  helge is awesome but not weird enough, 
  generally we have [ scooter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deqnqn9hfxo ) but that 's in english . 
  in german , well we have the new german death art and you 'll find a lot of weird lyrics thereabouts . 
  like goethes erben : [ das schwarze wesen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqn-ruzoi04 ) about the thing from the time before the past that begun to eat the future . 
   in berlin , do n't forget the glorious airport there ... that disaster did cost us 6 billion ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 2015 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ finished, 
  very basics : school basics : captain picard and the crew of the enterprise-d as well as scully and mulder fluent : movies/tv , video games , internet, 
  yes : \u00a7 166 stgb  defamation of religious denominations , religious societies and world view associations ( 1 ) whoever publicly or by dissemination of writings ( \u00a7 11 par . 
  3 ) defames , in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace , the substance of the religious or world view conviction of others , shall be fined or imprisoned for up to three years . 
  ( 2 ) whoever publicly or by dissemination of writings ( \u00a7 11 par . 
  3 ) defames , in a manner suitable to disturb the public peace , a church established in germany or other religious society or world view association , or their institutions or customs , shall be punished likewise . 
  according to this [ statistic ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/265995/umfrage/anzahl-der-elektroautos-in-deutschland/ ) we have 34.000 registered electric cars in germany in 2017 up from 25.500 the year before, 
   someone correct me no need you 're correct . 
  skills are much more important , and language ( especially speaking the native tongue of the country ) counts as such, 
  they 're good if you plan to do some garden work but as a street wear please do n't, 
  because everyone knows it 's the truth , 
  to be fair it 's greece , if the government or its institutions were doing their job the country would n't be so fucked up, 
  cameron tried the brexit vote in the hopes of getting positive results , stability and power . 
  he failed . 
  may tried an election in the hopes of getting positive results , stability and power . 
  she failed . 
  i 'm sensing a trend here . 
  i 'm guessing there are youth wrestling clubs somewhere in germany but wrestling in general is n't really common around here . 
  the only time i remember losing electricity myself was when a fuse in the house blew ( or whatever you call it ) but a whole area losing electricity does n't really happen . 
  no , because it 's not a matter of believe . 
  i believe in god , because i ca n't simply go and use science to proof his existence or simply point at him , that does n't work with what i believe god is . 
  as for climate change on the other hand , i could go science the shit out of it , look at the data for the last decades/centuries and extrapolate what that means for those pacific islands and you know holland . 
  but i 'm not a scientist , therefore i do n't do that and instead listen to scientist who tell me of our impact on the climate and what we have to do from a scientific standpoint to save at least holland from drowning . 
  data does n't care about believe . 
  handball or maybe ice hockey but it 's really far behind of football . 
  if you had been nicer to bill maybe he would n't have gone to buy cigarettes five years ago . 
  there is only one , we even went to versailles for it . 
  did he deny the holocaust at any point ? 
  if so he could get problems , if not i would think he 'd only have problems if someone would actually file a complaint for defamation or some such . 
  son , be quiet your mother and i want to drink our tea in peace . 
  hi frank , i 'm diplomatic , 
  let me be diplomatic here , we 're dissapointed, 
  there is always [ das lied von der elbe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_adwntohp8 ) ( the song of the elbe ) . 
  though i would n't use it in any kind of marketing or tourism event unless it 's for floods . 
  i would guess the unification of germany . 
  we do have some of the same kind of christian fundamentalists that you have over there but unlike yours our idiots are mostly silent and our two main christian denominations , the roman catholic church and the protestants ( mostly bunched together in the evangelical church in germany ( ekd ) ) do n't allow those fools any kind of spotlight . 
  overall the rcc is more conservative in certain topics , for instance when it comes to birth control , while the ekd often follows the zeitgeist more if you will . 
  as to politics , the c in cdu/csu does n't stand for cool or classy or anything like that , but nowadays that does n't mean that if you 're an christian you automatically vote for mutti and her crew just because they have christian in their name, 
  around here we have the [ tagesschau ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de ) at 20h for 15 min and the tagesthemen 22.15 for 30 min . 
  during the day we have a shorter version of the tagesschau every hour or so . 
  as to content it 's mostly serious news , got third page news we have rtl ii news or shit like that , though of course if the town were important the news of a dog being elected mayor there would appear in the prime news . 
  who cares about treaties if gro\u00dfdeutschland is back ? 
  i would guess austria . 
  last time they did vote for us . 
  here is an explanation for [ atlantropa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tedsqmjlmks ) for anyone who has no idea what op means . 
  no legally ( as in on paper ) she 's called jacqueline , but here friends and family will call her schakkeline, 
  schakkeline ( jacqueline ) , schantall ( chantal ), 
   only for kids and students . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's what op meant . 
  as that 's the case in germany too . 
  [ apparently ] ( https://vebu.de/veggie-fakten/entwicklung-in-zahlen/anzahl-veganer-und-vegetarier-in-deutschland/ ) we have ~ 8 million vegetarians ( 10 % of germans ) and 1,3 m vegans ( 1,6 % ) . 
  mutti is alright . 
   so , a good chunk of jacquelines are pronouncing every letter in the word and with a heavy german accent . 
  in other words : schakkeline, 
  f1 is pretty popular thanks to michael schumacher and sebastian vettel and because you need something to do in the football off-season . 
  as to other motorsports , compared to f1 they do n't really matter outside their fan circles of course . 
  this , though i would say kissing on the cheek is really only common with older female family members as in mother , grandmothers , aunts and the like, 
  do n't forget the component : `` if africa is not fucked up , they do n't produce that many terrorists '',
