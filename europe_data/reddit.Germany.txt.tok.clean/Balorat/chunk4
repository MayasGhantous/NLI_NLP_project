  i would add carl von clausewitz ( military ) , the brothers grimm ( literature ) , werner von braun ( rocket science ) and johann sebastian bach ( music ), 
  wait until the g20 meeting in hamburg is over and we see how `` well '' trump does in a meeting outside of america with more than one state leader . 
  it 's useless you could do something better with your time like [ w\u00f6rk ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/c8hunv2xgaadfqk.jpg ), 
  that 's what i mean with  if you do n't have anything, 
  but are n't there already enough tomatoes on a pizza in one form or another, 
  who the fuck puts ketchup on a pizza ? 
  i mean i can understand putting it on spaghetti if you do n't have anything else , but pizza ? 
  lord of the weed but no [ sinnlos im weltraum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lauihbaxbxy ) ? 
  not from the orthodox . 
  roman catholic here, 
  there is a minority of danes in schleswig-holstein , ( schleswig is ours , now and always !, 
  1864 was a good year !, 
  ) , they even have their own political party with seats in the state diet . 
  but have you ever heard of the tragedy of [ pelagius ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/pelagius.jpg ) the wise ? 
  i thought not . 
  it 's not a story the monks would tell you . 
  he 's a heretical legend . 
  pelagius was an ascetic , so powerful in speech , wise and harsh in his practice . 
  he could even use his methods to rid anyone of their passions ... bringing about spiritual life . 
  he had such knowledge of the holy life , he even taught that all men naturally had the grace in them to keep themselves from spiritually ... dying ... 
  the dark side of church history is a pathway to many doctrines some consider to be unorthodox ... 
  he became so influential , that eventually he was condemned for lying about his true doctrines in order not to lose his power ... which , eventually of course , he did . 
  unfortunately , augustine knew everything he taught . 
  then condemned by the council of orange , his career was put to sleep . 
  ironic . 
  his assumptions are unknowingly hailed in some traditions ... but not he himself . 
  wales might get left out every once in a while but that the other three are distinct is general knowledge . 
  we have the [ bundesadler/federal eagle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/coat_of_arms_of_germany.svg/500px-coat_of_arms_of_germany.svg.png ) . 
  it comes from the roman eagle , which was then used by the holy roman empire as the coat of arms , though in it double headed version ( similar to the byzantine eagle ) . 
  and from the hre on every true german successor state as well as austria used the eagle as well . 
  he fights him in the rosengartenlied, 
  if we go with the once and future king angle you should also mention frederick ii of whom that was said until barbarossa took on the role of the sleeping emperor, 
  either siegfried/sigurd , whose story was immortalised especially for modern times through richard wagner 's operas . 
  or dietrich von bern , the legendary version of theoderic the great , who amongst other things , lived at etzel 's ( a.k.a. 
  attila ) court for a while and fought siegfried and won . 
  you could go with arminius who stopped the roman conquest of the germanic territories through the varian disaster . 
  or you could go with otto the great , the first holy roman emperor . 
  or you could go with the greatest chancellor germany 's ever had , otto eduard leopold , prince of bismarck , duke of lauenburg , who finally united germany , threw out those useless austrians , showed the french what 's what and made sure that there would be no great war in europe with him at the helm . 
  or , because wilhelm ii was an idiot and let bismarck go , you could go with konrad adenauer , our second greatest chancellor who was essential in building the current version of germany . 
  i 'm guessing you 're talking about our favourite ever eurovision performance apart from those [ finns ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gah9nrgnhuu ) ( obviously ) ? 
  there is of course the only good ralph siegel entry , [ nicole 's - ein bisschen frieden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjdxnwfqpia ) , no crazy performance just a young woman ( + band ) and a good song . 
  does bushido and co. fall under that ? 
  funerals are done in the way the family/friends/whoever wants it to be , but mostly within/at the end of the following week , but afaik there is n't really a deadline ( unless it 's the fee of the undertaker for storing the body ) . 
  it can be done like op said , though it 's not a pub but a restaurant with a good meal/buffet or via catering service somewhere . 
  or you can only have a small service with the close friends/family directly at the grave , columbarium or even ( where possible ) at the natural burial site and depending on the religious background with a small service in the cemetery chapel . 
  or something in between , it all depends on how fast the bereaved want the whole thing to be over , how much money they want to spend ( because when they say death only costs your life , that ai n't true ) and of course how well liked the dead person was/is . 
  when my grandfather died , he was cremated by the undertaker and we had a small service ( = the necessary catholic rites at the grave ) just his children and his wife with the priest at the grave with the urn , and a mass with the close family and very close friends in remembrance to him with a very short homily and basically in place of that a eulogy from one of his sons . 
  afterwards all were invited into the parish hall to a buffet , that was it . 
  when my father died we did the same . 
   also this is for the catholic religion . 
  btw it 's either christian religion or catholic denomination/church, 
  lucius quinctius cincinnatus of course . 
  getting absolute power twice and giving it up both times shows what kind of a man you are . 
  that 's not to say that he is the only roman dictator i admire there are a few of them who held absolute power numerous times and gave it back freely . 
  they get the same deal as every other membership candidate no more and no less . 
   here you go american friends : ... bill and jack tell you that it 's v miles ... what are victory miles ? 
  you 're right i changed it, 
  which does n't matter if every bill and jack tells you that it 's five miles from here to there , so you can by ten gallons of water . 
  as far as i can tell , they 're good the way they are overall . 
  according to wiki yes , though i 've never tried powidl, 
   ~ ~ pb + ~ ~ plum puree is awesome ~ ~ on dresy bread . ~ ~ ftfy, 
  we have nutella , plum puree ( either the good one from thuringia or the lesser one from aachen ) , apple butter and golden syrup . 
  why do we need peanut butter ? 
  you do realise you 're talking about two very different countries right that are not even neighbours or have any real historical connections to one another . 
  you 're right , i forgot it 's different in english . 
  i 've been to every state at least once , though , with the exception of north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and berlin that only means visiting one or two cities there, 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_fluoridation ) has this nifty [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/water-fluoridation-extent-world-equirectangular.svg ) in regards to fluoridation , the more red a country the more fluoridation there is ( white being < 1 % and grey being unknown ) . 
  mailand and london would be places to go then , berlin wants to be one , though i 'm not sure how good they 're succeeding with this . 
  with only two candidates counting is easy , there were no third parties this time . 
  the civil war is still the war with the most casualties, 
   let 's be real , america has never fought a real war without being carried . 
  they did pretty good when it came to killing themselves though, 
   here was some speculation that a few wolves moved over from germany a while ago even in germany wolves are rare , there are apparently about [ 130 adult wolves ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/woelfe-in-deutschland-leben-46-wolfsrudel-a-1113715.html ) around here . 
   they do feature in gossip magazines still , and when there are `` royal events '' abroad , our tv commentators are besides themselves with joy upon spotting them . 
  but even in gossip magazines it 's mostly foreign royals/aristocrats be it british , spanish or dutch etc. 
  and op asked about our aristocrats . 
  since we disposed of them in 1918 , we still have people running around who think a lot of their `` von '' in the middle of their names but in reality they have no special status or anything like that . 
  in germany it 's apparently electronics and stuff like that ( pc , mobile phones etc. 
  ) , pharmacy stuff and cars/car parts . 
  this [ link ] ( http://www.auwi-bayern.de/nordamerika/usa/export-import-statistik.html ) does n't get more detailed than that, 
  unlike in other countries where they changed/repealed even that bastard they call healthcare , in germany healthcare works . 
  in germany we burn up cars and/or go demonstrating , as you can see from the pictures used by [ bild ] ( http://www.bild.de/news/inland/brandstiftung/mehrere-braende-in-der-walpurgisnacht-51539308.bild.html ), 
  this terrorist instructor made a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-j2pylcvi ) about the german weapon laws a year ago and one about [ self-defense ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrsuhtuqjkw ) , they should still be valid, 
   wait , i thought you were from the vatican ?!?!, 
  :d yeah but deus vult and what he wanted was that i use the vatican flair , so ... ;d, 
  of course , but being german , and being able to at least understand middle high german it does n't exactly fit in op 's question . 
  though i like the [ corvus corax version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2bq5lyn5pe ) better than the one you linked . 
  i 'm not sure about most beautiful i know but one of them is certainly [ baba yetu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijihdmyhe1a ) and i do n't speak swahili . 
  we 're not all dead yet , so that 's a plus ... 
  i know one thing that apparently has n't failed ... your drugs and i want some of those . 
  iirc the one country with the most cctv and such is in the process of leaving . 
  well of course the country of belgium does n't exist . 
  it 's only a highway from germany to you guys . 
  this is much older than reddit , that goes way back to the usenet days of old, 
  there some conspiracy theorists out there who believe there is a city called bielefeld in germany ... 
  the lengths those crazies go to is astounding . 
  for germany you have to understand one thing : there is football and there is everything else . 
  and everything else does n't matter unless it 's a european or world championship or a similar big event . 
  afaik there is no european american-football championship . 
  there was this thing called world war one , when it ended so did the monarchy in germany .
