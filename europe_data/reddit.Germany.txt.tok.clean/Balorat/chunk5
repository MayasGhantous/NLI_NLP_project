  and having the last emperor of germany as one of the key players responsible for starting the war to end all wars does n't exactly paint a pretty picture on the whole monarchy thing . 
   you do n't have the `` chivalrous '' ira who 'd warn of the existence of bombs beforehand . 
  i could be wrong but i do n't remember either the raf or the nsu and/or their respective ilk warning anyone before killing people . 
  and in the case of the ira , let 's just say that there 's ~ ~ op ~ ~ * erm * ira and there 's ira . 
   that just does n't happen in europe or at least it did n't before the rise of isis ; we 've had terrorism long before those guys came around , isis is nothing special . 
   but still , people in france , germany and the uk who wave realistic guns at people only if it 's deemed absolutely necessary , which i would say our guys can do better thanks to their training . 
  did n't you guys invade them `` accidentally '' once or twice ? 
  i would think one of the bigger problem for the us police and the biggest difference to europe is the time allotted for training/schooling . 
  for example in germany it takes you at least 2\u00a01/2 years to become a cop ( the exact length of the training varies up to 3\u00a01/2 years ) , while in the us it 's iirc only 6 months to a year . 
  let me check . 
   dear fatherland , no fear be thine , firm and true stands the watch , the watch at the rhine !, 
  it 's fatherland for germany, 
  there can never be one like the cage , he is truly unique . 
   but what 's the background on it ? 
   how true is this information ? 
  it depends . 
  if you speak with younger people in cities , they will in all likelihood speak good ( or at least understandable ) english , with older people however and out in the country you might not be so lucky . 
   my second question is where would you people recommend as a country to attend college in ? 
  in the case of germany it depends on the field in which you want to get your degree . 
  there are some fields of studies where the whole thing is in english ( especially in private universities ) but most of them only have some courses in english . 
  so you might want to look into studying in the uk and ireland unless you plan on learning the language thoroughly . 
   so my final question is , is there a violent anti-american sentiment where you are ? 
  unless you go around telling people that the country your currently in is shit and the us is far better and shit like that , you 're good and even if you were to do that you 're only getting laughed at in most cases . 
  though be prepared to answer questions like : `` how the hell could you let that happen '' and things like that . 
  it depends on what you mean with germanic country , as you apparently do n't mean german speaking country with it . 
  there were a lot of germans and austrians who liked him, 
  to be fair the french were n't exactly fond of him either, 
  according to bild it 's the beheaded german sailor in the philippines , the car racers from berlin that got a life sentence in their murder case and of course g\u00f6tze 's medical problems . 
   steyr produce ** d ** also something else than funky-looking assault rifles the tractor and gun producers are separate companies now . 
  yes , though i mostly use it to make tea and coffee . 
  i second brie and add young gouda . 
  with both parties speaking the same language ( more or less ) i like bap ( germany but colognian dialect ) and hubert von goisern ( austria ) - [ rita , mir zwei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zusaoub75yw ) and [ songs sinn dr\u00e4ume ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_odleolcco ), 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.offiziellecharts.de ) or you could use the [ mtv site ] ( http://www.mtv.de/charts/5-hitlist-germany-top-100 ), 
  anything by [ fettes brot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fettes_brot ) and [ die fantastischen vier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_fantastischen_vier ) , e.g. 
  [ emanuela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rigxc8putts ) , [ bettina , zieh dir bitte etwas an ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndlc8k1soas ) , [ nordisch by nature ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfwyo2mqxnw ) or [ an tagen wie diesen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbchsusqio4 ) ( all by fettes brot ) and [ die da ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9lqelwqzr0 ) , [ sie ist weg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vp2t9ntztw ) , [ mfg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuv3kvnvt-w ) or [ troy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkvudob9xd4 ) ( all by die fantastischen vier ] . 
  what are you on about ? 
  which election ? 
  the presidential election ? 
  van der bellen won both run-off ballots . 
  this !, 
  and let 's not forget with the exception of belarus there is no death penalty in europe and i do n't think that even in belarus they 're using hemlock to do the deed . 
   you also should mention arte , phoenix , 3sat which all are great , which in one way or another belong to either the ard or the zdf family or rather both, 
  yes to die zeit but der spiegel is often a bit too on the left for my taste . 
  when it comes to television and radio i would guess our two main public broadcasters ard and zdf . 
  which is why we 're replacing her with our new main [ man ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/us/resource/static/images/meps/schultz-smile.jpg ) , that way she 's available once it gets colder . 
   sophie gr\u00e9goire is mighty fine . 
  you 're right which is why he wo n't give her up , it 's cold up north the more warm bodies you have with you at night the better, 
  here on reddit there is / r/ukrainianconflict, 
  yes else your prime minister comes to your house and your girl/wife falls in love with him . 
  have fun being single . 
  in germany you have a number of free channels that finance themselves through advertisement . 
  but the two main broadcasters are the german channels of the rtl group ( rtl , rtl 2 , super rtl , vox , n-tv ) and prosiebensat .1 media ( prosieben , kabel eins , sat .1 , sixx , n24 ) . 
  they show everything from sport events to dubbed hollywood movies and american/british/wherever tv shows and also produce their own tv-shows and movies . 
  but you also have the public service broadcasters ard and zdf as well as their members . 
  for those basically every german pays a licence fee to the gez ( or whatever they 're calling it these days ) . 
  those ~ 18 $ per month are basically mandatory for everyone regardless of whether you actually have a tv or not and getting an exemption from that is n't easy . 
  the only good thing on ard/zdf are the news and every other documentary they 're doing . 
  the rest consists of soap operas and dubbed hollywood movies , though they 're also spending millions to bid on the broadcasting rights for sport evens like the fifa world cup for instance ( against the free broadcasters and pay-tv channels like sky ) the third `` option '' are those pay-tv channels but i 've never used them , so i 'm not sure what they 're all about . 
   how do you enforce such reforms when there are so many centuries of entrenched practice and millions of people have learned the old rules ? 
  by not changing the rules too much and even then the implementation went very slowly . 
  i would guess the closest we have to that would be the kultusministerkonferenz , the conference of ministers of education . 
  they were responsible for the german orthography reform of 1996 for instance . 
  but as their name suggest their focus is n't solely on orthography but the whole education sector . 
  edit : there is something much closer to your academy , the [ institute of german language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ids_\u2013_institute_of_german_language ) as well as the [ association for the german language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gesellschaft_f\u00fcr_deutsche_sprache ) who were actually responsible for creating the reform that the kultusministerkonferenz voted on and made official . 
  no the names we have for other countries have historical reasons , even if we sometimes do n't exactly know what they are . 
  those names are etched into our mind and our books and what not . 
  if you mean the american kind you might be on to something, 
  as they ca n't play football it must be rugby, 
  same here, 
   how it originated . 
  in ye olden days the romans founded the proud city of colonia claudia ara agrippinensium which we know today as cologne . 
  about a millennia later the last remnants of the neanderthals flocked together , threw up some mud to build holes and called it a city . 
  nearly a millennia later the prussians came to our great river . 
  them being heretics they decided in their heretical ways to make that heretical turd of a city the capital of the newly formed rhineprovince instead of the far greater and better and still proud and catholic city of cologne . 
  some years after that the english came , once again heretics , and decided in their heretical ways ( you see the pattern here ) to make that now burnt turd of city the new capital of north rhine westphalia instead of the still greater and better ( in every way ) proud city of cologne . 
  i 'm pretty sure you have on your little island there some city or place that is so bad that you would rather kill yourself than having to go there ? 
  a place that looks and smells like one of those forgotten toilets at the motorway that have n't been cleaned in decades if ever ? 
  a place where , should you ever have the great misfortune of actually going there , you think of going to hell as a great destination during the holidays ? 
  well in germany we call that place d\u00fcsseldorf . 
   cologne you already have the best city to visit , just make sure you do n't go to d\u00fcsseldorf and you 're alright for germany . 
  apparently there are two version , one with [ chantr\u00e9 ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xupxx_adolf-hitler-ich-hock-in-meinem-bon_fun ) and the one i linked with ros\u00e9 . 
  yes we 're basically at war , which is why [ i live in my bunker with my dog and a bottle ros\u00e9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np2ymo0imfk ) . 
  but to be honest now , it is n't true , especially compared to the us for instance . 
  regarding wacken you should watch [ full metal village ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_metal_village ) a great documentary about the relationship between the village of wacken ( 1,800 residents ) and the annual festival ( 80,000 + attendees ) . 
  next to the already mentioned wacken open air , we have the [ hurricane festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hurricane_festival ) as well as [ rock am ring and rock im park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rock_am_ring_and_rock_im_park ) and we had the [ love parade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/love_parade ) but that was cancelled after 21 people died there in 2010 . 
  edit : and i forgot the [ wave-gotik-treffen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wave-gotik-treffen ) in leipzig one of the largest of its kind . 
  funny story , it actually [ is ] ( http://www.visitberlin.de/en/news-release/berlin-is-the-new-vegetarian-capital ) . 
  there are quite a number of [ vegetarian restaurants ] ( https://www.berlin.de/restaurants/vegetarisch/ ) in the city . 
  in germany we have 4 % vegetarians according to a recent [ study ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/ernaehrung/vegetarier-nur-vier-prozent-der-menschen-in-deutschland-leben-fleischlos-a-1128290.html ) ( german though ) . 
  broken up into genders we have 6,1 % of women and 2,5 % of men that are vegetarians . 
   is it seen as a virtue ? 
  i guess vegetarians themselves might look at it that way but everyone else does n't . 
  and to add to that in regards to amsterdam , if you had enough to drink and need to take a leak , follow this [ guide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prgwp9_j1uy ), 
  do n't be an ass , though that advise works every time not just while travelling in europe . 
  distance is an issue , because long distance relationships are n't easy . 
  other than that , the nationality is n't even a secondary issue . 
  i would n't even call it tertiary , it 's so far down the line it does n't really exist anymore and probably only makes an appearance when it comes to different traditions on holidays like christmas etc. . 
  you forgot the brothers grimm and other fairy tales from people like hans christian andersen . 
  or just a slightly annoyed `` wat ? '', 
  of course anybody could , to quote myself :  but with religious ( or even non-religious ) organisation that was never the question , it 's simply that the religious ones are doing it .
