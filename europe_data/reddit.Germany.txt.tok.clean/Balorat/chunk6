  which makes them useful . 
   they got their money from the state . 
   yeah it 's the same here . 
  but they 're doing the job the state would have to provide anyway . 
  but with religious ( or even non-religious ) organisation doing the job the only thing the state has to do is to pay the bill . 
  the state does n't need to worry about employees , the mission/direction of the institution , the building itself and what not . 
  especially on the health and child care as well as the `` social '' sector , be it hospitals , schools/kindergartens , nursing homes/hospices and providing help for those that are homeless , junkies or otherwise need help . 
  you 're right yugoslavia was non-aligned but we were talking about romania . 
  because it 's not easy for a region to secede from its mother country . 
  you think brexit is going to be easy , the process for scotland to become a sovereign country would be far worse . 
  we 're the birthplace of this [ guy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/martinluther-workshopcranachelder.jpg/1024px-martinluther-workshopcranachelder.jpg ) and 1/3 of our population belongs to the catholic church , the other 1/3 is protestant and the rest is everything else . 
  my view of organised religion is that it is useful as it can provide services that state either ca n't or simply wo n't . 
   are you happy with your country 's legal system ? 
  yes . 
   is this true ? 
  well we do n't have capital punishment ( afaik anywhere in the eu at least ) , other than that , in general they 're not lax at least in germany . 
   former soviet states does n't work if you include romania because we are n't former soviet just former communist . 
  you 're right . 
  i meant the former satellite states or ussr aligned states , that made up the eastern bloc along with the ussr itself . 
  you could make it about the governmental changes in the former soviet states since the fall of the ussr and compare the ones closer to the `` west '' ( = germany and westward ) to those closer to russia ( assuming there are differences ) . 
  that way you could ask how democratic those states really are and could even include recent events like what 's happening in romania , the whole ukraine mess and whatever else goes on there . 
  though of course that only covers eastern europe as the gdr is a special case . 
  to be honest op has to watch his/her money regardless as those four cities also have many pickpockets that specialise in robbing tourists, 
  no , we 're doing the thing * better * by also making fun of it , that 's my point . 
  nope , by showing america how it 's done right , because we 're building bridges not walls . 
  if you want to see who 's copying america go to / r/the _ petry, 
  have you seen / r/the _ schulz ? 
  we 're making europe great again . 
   cologne - if you want really `` liberal '' [ viva colonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yurjcvnxlu ), 
  to be fair with this post alone you 're showing us that you really do n't know how it is to be european because you do n't live here , as you 're trying to generalise a large number of different countries each with a history that reaches back in many cases for millennia which in turn shaped their culture in different ways . 
   it 's really good thx , i 'm going to check it out  oh , so that 's an artist ? 
  not only are they a band , they 're even named after a character in the witcher books , [ percival schuttenbach ] ( http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/percival_schuttenbach ), 
   friedrich schiller , who wrote the lyrics of the eu anthem the thing is though the eu anthem does n't use those lyrics . 
  in swedish that is [ garmarna - herr mannelig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy44ocuowhe ) . 
  in polish that would be [ lazare ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixnkxrvx3z4 ) , though percival has quite a number of good songs , as i learned thanks to cdpr and the witcher trilogy . 
  and since i do n't speak old high german [ ougenweide - pal\u00e4stinalied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsndt7pxx1k ), 
  tours and poitiers was more important for the rise and power of karl martell which in the end helped his grandson charlemagne do his thing . 
  but the force that was stopped there was more a raiding party than an actual invasion force . 
  prussian here and only very few schools in the rhineland have flags or even flagpoles . 
  i 'm guessing the money helps, 
  yeah [ astrotv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zme7qvzowza ), 
   jana pawla ii the vatican had him already on their [ coins ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/va.en.html ) back when he was pope ( and alive ) . 
  so i would guess they would claim him on their notes too unless they 're continuing the theme of always having the current popes on all coins ( and notes ) . 
  the same ones that were on the deutsche mark . 
  - [ bettina von arnim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bettina_von_arnim ) ( 5 $ ) - [ carl friedrich gau\u00df ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_friedrich_gauss ) ( 10 $ ) - [ annette von droste-h\u00fclshoff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annette_von_droste-h\u00fclshoff ) ( 20 $ ) - [ balthasar neumann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balthasar_neumann ) ( 50 $ ) - [ clara schumann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clara_schumann ) ( 100 $ ) - [ paul ehrlich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_ehrlich ) ( 200 $ ) - [ maria sibylla merian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_sibylla_merian ) or exchange her with [ wilhelm and jacob grimm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brothers_grimm ) who were on the 1000 dm note . 
  most schools around these parts do n't even have flags, 
  he also wrote most of his orient books before actually going to there, 
  yeah dschinghis khan the only good thing ralph siegel ever produced, 
  imo the only outcome of a successful conception is the creation of a new human being ( which of course can easily die in the process but that does n't exactly stop with the birth ) and therefore the embryo should already be considered human which includes `` access '' to human rights of which the right to live is paramount . 
  the works are still popular the german tv network rtl released a remake of the [ winnetou movies ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4893452/ ) after christmas last year though i have n't seen them yet . 
  as for myself i 've read all of his arabia novels with kara ben nemsi and hadschi halef omar ben hadschi abul abbas ibn hadschi dawuhd al gossarah as well as his america novels with old shatterhand . 
  and bread, 
  the only reason i could think of to support minorities in another country would be if those minorities had to flee the country and/or if there was a genocide happening targeting them . 
  if your starting in the netherlands your first german stop should be either aachen and then cologne or just cologne, 
  having to read shakespeare in some inferior translation after reading it in its klingon original, 
   we 'll pay $ 10/month for a european version of netflix does n't exist . 
  but you have things like the iplayer from the bbc or the mediathek from ard/zdf ( german ) and i would guess the french and others have something similar . 
  but i doubt that outside of the british none of that is even subtitled in english , if anything it 's subtitled in the native language for the hearing impaired . 
   i think you mean `` once upon a time ... life ; es war einmal das leben '' that was the cartoon inside the human body the whole once upon a time franchise was awesome, 
  apart from the usual gummi bears , ducktales and darkwing duck there is nils holgersson and [ the wonderful adventures of nils ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzknxmc3woi&amp;list=pllad-ccorbhjhbmemu6ozyqxxjcgnt8_y ), 
  charlemagne converted the saxons with fire and steel during the saxon wars in 772 -- 804 . 
  he is one of the best admirals out there, 
  are you sure he was actually a teacher ? 
  if the one god belafarinrod use it , it 's law . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pll6vpopjak ), 
  in germany every region ( more or less ) has its own anthem which stems from the time before the empire when those regions were still sovereign countries . 
  but outside of fraternities and their commercium songs you do n't really hear them that often . 
  because if the homo neanderthalensis were wise he would n't have lived near d\u00fcsseldorf, 
  we had ( or maybe still have ? ), 
  studivz and sch\u00fclervz for students and pupils respectively . 
  but with facebook and whatsapp/threema and the like they lost a lot of users . 
  do n't forget the duisburg inner harbour the largest inland port in the world, 
  i would n't discount the actions and words of their own people like h\u00f6cke that lead to them losing percents in the polls, 
  though the text itself is n't part of the anthem . 
  there is only one : ludwig van beethoven 's [ symphony no . 
  5 in c minor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nis40fxro64 ) as you probably have to look a long time to find someone who does n't at least know those first four notes . 
  apparently we did n't [ shed enough blood of the saxon men ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc0s60gp5rm ), 
  i would create one just for the journey and make myself look like the greatest us fanboy ever, 
   and i remember this one . 
  r/worldnews decided it was a terror attack . 
  to be fair / r/worldnews sees everything as a terror attack edit : hm i was downvoted , if i were / r/worldnews i 'd call it a terror attack ... those damn muslim downvoters, 
  seeing how big the tourism industry is in/for turkey , that 's a very good idea . 
  / u/rewboss made a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfsu1oxc1ag ) about eu 's centre a while back, 
   given the constant terrorist attacks you do n't seem to know a lot of history . 
  we 've been having terror attacks around these parts since ( at least ) the end of wwii . 
   lack of caring from the governments or the political left i 'm not sure if you know but europe is n't part of the us and therefore not ( mis ) ruled by trump and co. . our governments actually care about us ( though some could probably care more )  and the state of the eu just because the brits want to leave does n't mean the eu nears its end and europe would collapse with it, 
  not exactly it was a year after he was shot in vatican city . 
  in 1982 st. john paul ii was stabbed in fatima by a priest . 
  the convention on the prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction thought so back in 1993 and all but four un member states ( israel , egypt , north korea and south sudan ) agreed . 
  do n't touch ~ ~ our ~ ~ erm the nazi gold or we show you what [ time it is ] ( http://cdn-live.warthunder.com/uploads/95/66c46acaaf7aebb5f474fbad5ab39580af5b5e_mq/anschlusszeit.png ), 
  do we want to steep so low as to be on r/worldnews level ? 
  aldi s\u00fcd is best aldi . 
  aldi nord only sells shit . 
  you could have placed your flag near our own and join our great league of nation flags with the french , the belgians and our newer members . 
  and together we have withstood several attempts of the void and prospered . 
  but instead you chose to be in the centre ... alone . 
   now is not a time for nationalism . 
  have you listen to your government lately ? 
  are we forgetting [ lexx ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyoq6sovr8y ) ? 
  sure the canadians helped but it was made in germany with financial support from the british .
