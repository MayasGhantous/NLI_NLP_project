  and then there is [ raumpatrouille orion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raumpatrouille_\u2013_die_phantastischen_abenteuer_des_raumschiffes_orion ) . 
  is turkey really still a secular state anyway ? 
  i 'm under the impression that it gradually changed under erdogan . 
  though to be fair english is only on fifth place when it comes to numbers of speakers in europe . 
  german , russian , french and italian have more speakers . 
  once again the [ satw ] ( https://satwcomic.com/bye-bye-england-and-friends ) one is the best . 
  should n't it be `` just '' ireland in that case ? 
  well i do n't shed a tear for them, 
  i 'm guessing this means the uk will be the new members in erdogan 's nazi club . 
  except that there is no such invoice . 
  should n't the birthplace rather be the abbey of saint scholastica near subiaco or more precisely the cave ( s ) around there ? 
   i 'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit . 
  that question might be better asked over at / r/germany, 
  except of course that it 's not a german gas company, 
  that question might be better posted over at / r/askeurope, 
  who came up with the idea to make paris and madrid the sole hub for each country ? 
  seeing what schulz brought since the announcement of his candidacy , a surge in the polls and in new members , they did n't really had any reasons to do anything else . 
  well nazis are standing together, 
  with their economy ? 
  i doubt it , to truly be a superpower you need the economy to support it . 
  the us has that , so does china , russia is failing on that part . 
  neither the netherlands or germany would do that and that 's why they 're nazis . 
  been there , done that , bismarck is awesome . 
  if that were to happen i would guess erdowahn would call all nato members nazis, 
  i 'm sorry for you having to go through d\u00fcsseldorf is something i would n't wish for my nemesis . 
  nah we should be called they ` remany, 
  i guess it 's a good place to find young women for bunga bunga, 
  though op was n't exactly wrong , it should be plural as the afd spokesperson , co-founder and whatever else he is , gauland is now [ defending h\u00f6cke ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/alternative-fuer-deutschland-afd-vize-gauland-verteidigt-hoeckes-hitler-aussage/19487308.html ) and btw if anyone has access to the wsj [ here ] ( https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-politicians-comments-about-hitler-stoke-debate-1488912569 ) is the original interview in english ( or at least excerpts ), 
  or : the doctor in traditional formal scottish attire, 
  you 're right  the eu is several treaties between 28 member states and one of those treaties says that the eu negotiates for those 28 member states together in questions like this . 
  so again either the eu is part of the program or it is n't . 
  which does n't matter because in that case ( and other ) the eu acts as one entity . 
  so either the eu is part of the visa waiver program or it is n't . 
  the us had three years to solve that question , but the last administration chose not to . 
  but it was sometime last year was n't it ? 
  is n't twitter ~ ~ banned ~ ~ blocked in turkey thanks to erdogan ? 
  it has been unthinkable since that notion was discussed for the first time decades ago and i do n't think anything has changed since then . 
  in germany there are about 2 % orthodox , which makes them the third largest denomination after catholics and protestants . 
  that `` article '' is from august last year, 
   without even a mention for what they apologise . 
  apart from [ mentioning ] ( https://www.zdf.de/doku-wissen/richtigstellung-tendera-102.html ) it of course, 
  jamaica or as they called it saarmaika did work for a few years in the saarland, 
  is n't there always a shortcut directly at the store foyer ? 
  that 's why you let your wife/girlfriend do the walking while you sit your ass down in the restaurant and eat a serving or two of k\u00f6ttbullar . 
  that goes without saying, 
   your satire is n't very subtle ... because it is n't satire , between 2003 and 2012 the us military in germany cost the german taxpayer nearly [ 600 million euros ] ( http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/131/1713166.pdf#page=2 ), 
  please do you cost us way too much, 
  a while ago [ willy brandt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willy_brandt ) met with [ walter ulbricht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walter_ulbricht ) . 
  after the official talks are over they get into a conversation with each other . 
  walter asks willy : `` i would like to know what kind of hobby you have . '', 
  willy : `` i collect jokes people make about me . 
  but what about you ? '', 
  walter : `` i 've got a similar one . 
  i collect people , who make jokes about me . '', 
  or : [ erich honecker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erich_honecker ) is standing on the balcony at his home and watches the sun rise . 
  he says : `` good morning dear sun . '', 
  the sun responds : `` good morning dear erich . '', 
  the same thing happens at noon . 
  `` good day dear sun . '', 
  - `` good day dear erich . '', 
  and again in the evening : `` good evening dear sun '' . 
  whereupon the sun responds : `` screw you , i 'm now in the west ! '', 
  only if german bread gets the same honour . 
  someone should create a subreddit collecting maps that do n't show vatican city . 
   is it even in the dictionary that 's why i linked to duden . 
  nope it 's actually [ truthuhn ] ( http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/truthuhn ) , [ truthahn ] ( http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/truthahn ) is just the male bird . 
  though i had to look it up myself first too . 
  i 'm pretty sure this is the wrong subreddit for that, 
  this !, 
  ~ ~ sparta ! ~ ~ awwwesome !, 
  you guys wee need to look out for that guy with that strong european heritage or we 're going to get our arses kicked, 
  let 's not forget that the guy is the editor-at-large of inforwars , you know [ those guys ] ( http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/alex-jones-mis-infowars-7-bat-sht-conspiracy-theories-w467509 ), 
   well making more money as well but yeah it 's completely one sided . 
  making more money does n't really mean much if you have to pay much more for healthcare and spend more on oil and electricity and having more babies is n't exactly cheap either . 
  so apart from the having more babies there are only downsides , it 's a good thing i 'm not planning to move there then . 
  i ca n't say i 'm surprised about the result when it comes to the afd, 
  yeah games from european countries . 
  games like the anno series , or the gothic series , or the settlers, 
  i would really like to know what would happen if you were to release a show like that for the children of today, 
  i still know the words of the [ intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bd11f_zp9m ) and of course the great [ warum bin ich so fr\u00f6hlich ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opmhpg3vlda ), 
  aww i remember him well . 
  the story behind it is actually interesting . 
  it started as an idea in west german television , but just days before the first episode would have been released , the east german television released their own version having heard of the plans in the west . 
  and for the next thirty years german children grew up with their own little sandman , one for the east and one ( for a few years even two ) for the west . 
  after reunification the western one was scrapped in favour of the more popular eastern version , where the famous [ song ] ( / / www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxa1pn0kgao ) originates . 
  is n't that what you would call a normal thursday in paris ? 
  this !, 
  nils holgersson really belongs to / r/alwaysinmyheart, 
   he was the most powerful person in german television and left television basically on the height of his career . 
  that 's how you do it . 
  let 's not forget that great [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-zbnvldrbc ) stefan raab made for the 25th anniversary of the show . 
  i loved the stories as a kid . 
  since you decided to delete your last post and the one before that , let me get in on that reposting thing of yours :  like it or not breitbart is far more reliable than op . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are no degrees when it comes to being unreliable , you either are or you 're not and breitbart has already proven that it is unreliable . 
  making up a story about an attack on a church in dortmund , germany out of completely unconnected events , all the while using a german [ `` source '' ] ( http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/staedte/dortmund/44137-dortmund~/fragen-und-antworten-wie-medien-die-silvesternacht-fuer-hass-aufbau-nutzen;art930,3187550 ) that does n't affirm breitbart 's story in the least , does n't really scream reliability . 
  the whole once upon a time/es war einmal ... franchise is awesome, 
  yeah you 're right but i hoped that the european redditors would recognise sarcasm even without it ... 
   like it or not breitbart is far more reliable than op .
