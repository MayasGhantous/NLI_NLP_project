  the same question was [ posted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5us5fq/now_i_got_even_more_curious_who_else_had_him/ ) like one hour ago, 
   ( dont know the english name ) it 's tintin and snowy, 
  so i should listen to some random guy on the internet and not such a trusted news source like breitbart ? 
  gaston is and was awesome, 
  i grew up with them and tintin, 
  the cities have internet with reasonable speed though, 
   it should be worldwide , at least european-wide available . 
  it is n't , i even live near the german-french border and it 's not available . 
  connecting the countryside to the internet with reasonable speed would be a good start . 
  still the best capital germany ever had , no other city has the adenauer seal of approval . 
  you do n't know the story about the pied piper of hamelin ? 
  tl ; dr  tillerson , the former head of exxon mobil corp. , was at the sanitarium because bonn 's hotels were all booked by the time he confirmed his attendance at this week 's group of 20 meeting . 
   top affordable holiday destinati ... is not writing the last letters of a word a thing now ? 
  but was n't there also a story about a mistress a few days ago ? 
  i thought it was a english wife and german mistress but i could have it the other way around, 
  nah he has a german mistress iirc, 
  that 's easy the uk will have inspectors up there on their border who will tell the evil german winds that they 're no longer allowed in and that the uk is only for uk wind . 
  the only reason they could n't do that before is of course ( as always ) because of brussels . 
  nah the uk should build massive fans to drive the air back, 
  just because some people in the [ fes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_ebert_foundation ) are talking about giving immigrants from non-eu states who come to germany to live here , the right to vote ( in local elections ) before they 're naturalised ( as is already the case in 15 of 28 eu states ) does n't mean germany is planning that . 
   nope , but it 's a pretty safe bet that military leaders are n't stupid and would n't allocate budget that way . 
  and what happens when the military leaders say they do n't want tanks but the [ lawmakers ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/9/lawmakers-force-pentagon-to-buy-tanks-keep-ships-a/ ) say they do ? 
  increasing the budget to 2 % means nothing if all you do is to pay the barrack janitors more . 
  same goes for germany, 
  am german , can confirm , am right . 
  that the greek see themselves as the most trustworthy simply does n't stop to be funny regardless of how often i 've seen that study by now . 
  i would guess because all the young adults are leaving the smaller towns and villages for the bigger cities and dresden happens to be one of the biggest around , along with leipzig who held the title in 2015 . 
  which is also the reason east germany in general is so old , there is simply no future for the young . 
  does anyone actually watches euronews ? 
  just because it can theoretically reach 277 million households does it really mean they actually watch it ? 
  i would guess the scottish oil is also a big plus, 
  it 's also a question how many of those measuring stations you have around . 
  just compare la , one of the cities with the highest air pollution in the states with any of the bigger european cities be it london , paris or even the ruhr area and you find a lot more of those measuring stations in europe than in the us . 
  but it has a clear written constitution the codex iuris canonici or * code of canon law *, 
  thx , though if common law works with precedents the point on the map which i presume marks vatican city has the wrong colour as canon law does n't work with precedents . 
  can anyone eli5 what the difference between civil law and common law is ? 
  he would be the first politician coming back from the eu to take office in berlin , before it was always the other way around . 
  but he really has a chance , as he is the first actual viable candidate to serve as an alternative to merkel , unlike the previous spd candidates . 
   unity and justice and freedom works pretty good, 
  so we 've already reached our 2020 goal ? 
  or are the 20 % meant for each country and not the eu as a whole ? 
  because that would include either most if not all 27 eu countries and would probably fall under the whole brexit/article 50 negotiations . 
  but more importantly , it 's you who is in the process of going . 
   the uk offered to guarantee the rights of eu citizens in the uk if the eu did the same for the uk . 
  the eu said no . 
  this means the uk needs to be punished for some reason ... ? 
  the uk had what 8 months now ( ? ), 
  to trigger article 50 to begin the negotiations ( which includes a guarantee of those rights ) . 
  it was clear long beforehand that there are no negotiations about anything brexit related before triggering article 50 . 
  a unilateral decision on uk 's side would have been a good move towards an amicable agreement in the end . 
  the uk chose not to . 
  epic finnish dude is epic, 
  let 's face it itt : people who do n't understand how diplomacy works, 
   the song is the anthem . 
  no it ** is n't ** . 
  [ only the third stanza of the song is our anthem . 
  it 's not the wrong version of the anthem , it 's simply not the anthem , as our anthem is only the third stanza of the lied der deutschen . 
  you 're absolutely right and if anyone wants to read it or listen/watch it , here you go : www.bundestag.de/parlament/praesidium/reden/2017/003/492714 ( only in german though ), 
  it 's not the extended anthem , our anthem is only the third stanza . 
  today a spd president , in september a spd chancellor, 
   `` tina , was kosten die kondome ?! '', 
   a regional speciality which is the reason the city is no longer german ... ca n't have that shit inside our borders, 
  i 'm not sure i understand what this image is supposed to tell me, 
  carl von clausewitz , vom kriege ( seeing as that 's how our unification happened )  * `` war is merely the continuation of policy by other means . 
  are lodg 'd within my breast , '' * ( i 'm using bayard taylor 's translation here ), 
  neither of your links ( maybe apart from dailymail i have n't checked that shit ) is fake news . 
  they all make it clear that it 's not just the jews but instead all non-eu citizenship , but as she was asked directly about jews the papers have one clear example . 
  was it a loaded question to ask specifically about jews ? 
  sure , but let 's face it front national and anti-semitism is n't exactly far apart thanks to her father and his generation so it 's an easy road to go . 
  still it is n't fake news . 
  do n't forget to kiss your ~ ~ sister ~ ~ i mean wife goodbye before you go shootin ', 
  the only difference between you and texas is that you are actually seceding from the union, 
  spain is basically europe 's florida, 
  back in 2013 arte ( a french/german channel ) had a show that included a bit ( iirc ) about concentration camps . 
  they translated the announcement for that from french into german but now it did n't make it clear that they were german camps and not polish . 
  the zdf ( one of the owners of arte and the announcement in question was on their website ) saw their mistake , corrected it and apologised twice for it . 
  but still a former inmate sued the zdf , the zdf lost and was forced to issue a formal apology on their website , which they [ did ] ( https://www.zdf.de/doku-wissen/richtigstellung-tendera-102.html ) shortly after the verdict was rendered . 
  except of course the zdf is n't a newspaper and they already have apologised for their mistake three times . 
  according to the injunction yeah we are allowed to do that , though of course the law itself is going to be repealed soon afterwards things will look different . 
  from the dw article i assume the court uses the same passages from the injunction back in 2016 and using the translation from [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ebe9p/what_b\u00f6hmermann_said_english_translation/ ) by / u/humankapital291 : * sod-dumb , cowardly and hesitant / is erdogan the president / * his boner smells like d\u00f6ner / even a pig 's fart smells finer / * he 's the man who punches girls / while wearing a bloody rubber mask / * things he loves the most / is shagging goats / * and oppressing minorities kicking kurds , beating up christians / * while watching child porn / and in the evening instead of a nap / fellatio with a hundred sheep / erdogan is all things considered / a president with a tiny wang / every turk can be heard whispering : / this dumb pig has got shrivel-balls / from ankara to istanbul / everyone knows this man is gay / perverted and zoophil / recep fritzl priklopil / his head as empty as his balls / the star guest on every gang-bang party / until his tiny wang starts to burn while having a piss / that 's reccep erdogan everything that 's in italics can still be used, 
  it 's part of the wendlingen-ulm high-speed railway which in turn is part of the main line for europe . 
  they built the first bridges for it in 2011 but the actual railway construction only started in 2012 and it 's supposed to be used starting 2021, 
   and the disinformation does not have to about germany . 
  but that was what they were looking for , to quote the [ dw article ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-intelligence-finds-no-evidence-of-putin-disinformation-campaign/a-37448072 ) :  russian president vladimir putin is not deliberately trying to undermine chancellor angela merkel ahead of her impending re-election campaign - or at least , if he is , he is hiding his tracks well . 
  [ ... ] `` an open/direct control or financing through russian state authorities or russian intelligence agencies could not be proven in any cases , '' the report said . 
  nevertheless , such activities `` could be carried out by people and organizations outside the services . '', 
  to be fair that whole safe space nonsense ( and everything connected with it ) has n't swapped over the pond to these parts yet, 
  last i checked neither norway nor denmark nor the uk are part of germany ( even though we tried ) and the bnd only searched for a direct campaign of disinformation in germany and not for disinformation regarding other european countries from a russian tv channel . 
  while it may be interesting it 's not interesting enough to post it twice, 
  a lot of people ( at least ) in the eu ( [ parliament ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/02/european-union-trump-ambassador-ted-malloch-parliament ) ) think we would be better off with ted malloch outside the position of us ambassador to the eu ... so there is that . 
  to be fair / r/the _ hitler just redirects to the_donald , so it 's not exactly european, 
  you get one or two articles about who won or what happened during the half-time show if it mattered in the standard newspapers , it 's different with sport newspapers of course . 
  the same goes for tv and radio . 
  though i would guess you can watch the whole thing through pay-per-view channels . 
  but in general it does n't really matters . 
  or a sticky thread about the upcoming elections and election system in the various countries, 
  i would be interested in that as well , the same would go for our neighbours and geert wilders, 
  hm you have a government that does n't represent you ( or at least most of you ) but still taxes you ... yes ... what could you do about it ... if only there were historic precedents to learn what to do in such a situation ... 
  i hope they follow that request or whatever you call it, 
  why ?
