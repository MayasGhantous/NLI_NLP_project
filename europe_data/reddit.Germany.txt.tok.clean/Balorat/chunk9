  he was born in salzburg which was and still is in austria, 
   i find this strangely arousing you might want to ask falco 's countryman freud what that says about you, 
  the only time amadeus mozart may be connected with anything like electronic music is in the form of the one and only [ falco ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvikz8oe_xa ), 
  ** mods ** ban / u/owlpoofs for posting crimes against humanity !, 
  at least he had enough sense to make way for our godchancellor to build bridges, 
  though to be honest we also want to be [ f\u00f6rster ] ( https://i.imgur.com/8ue0get.jpg ), 
   they 've paid the equivalent of $ 12 a ticket , which is a lot of money in russia . 
  for a former superpower that 's kind of sad , though not really surprising, 
  do n't get him started , posting that is apparently a regular/daily thing now, 
  with railroads the question is how far in advance you can buy your tickets . 
  if i were to buy a ( db ) train ticket from vienna to berlin right now it would cost me about 120 to 200 euros . 
  if i book the same journey a month from now ( again a saturday ) the price would go down to 40 euros . 
   is there a pass you can buy that you can use to get just about anywhere ? 
  yes [ interrail ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interrail ) as to ryanair you might want to check out other low-cost airlines as ryanair does n't fly from austria to either berlin or paris afaik . 
  but again it would be a question of how far in advance you can buy your ticket and of course flying would probably go faster than going there buy train . 
   bild for people with abitur is n't that the focus ? 
  the latest/current [ new yorker ] ( http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/58941ea925000032080b6aba.jpeg?cache=ea6nlhbvyy ) cover does it better to be honest, 
  as long as the vote is legal and done properly i do n't think there would be any kind of problems . 
  it would be accepted as the will of the people it 's not like we do n't have a number of monarchs around already . 
  to quote myself from that very article : we 're in the process of getting it back . 
  the plan is to have 50 % of our gold in frankfurt by the end of 2020 . 
  when that started in 2013 we only had 31 % there ( of 3.391 tons of gold ) the rest in nyc ( 45 % ) , london ( 13 % ) and paris ( 11 % ) . 
  in 2020 it 's supposed to have changed to nyc ( 37 % ) and london ( 13 % ) with no gold in paris anymore . 
  [ german source ] ( https://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/de/downloads/presse/publikationen/2013_01_16_thiele_praesentation_pressegespraech_gold.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  i like that adenauer painting,

   it would be better if it took regional economic realities into account for pricing in any way , honestly . 
  gog.com does that afaik, 
   in december , a polish court ruled that german broadcaster zdf must apologise to an auschwitz survivor for referring to `` polish death camps '' in promotional material for a documentary . 
  there is an ongoing row over whether zdf adequately complied with the ruling . 
  this is btw the [ apology ] ( https://www.zdf.de/doku-wissen/richtigstellung-tendera-102.html ) due to the judgement . 
  they had already apologised before that which apparently was n't enough . 
  in many cases you can do that already you do n't even need to go to poland just buy a key on the internet ( just not on steam ) . 
  but i would guess that geoblocks that are there to prevent that are not subject of this investigation either . 
  games that are not sold in specific countries due to their youth protection laws or other kind of laws , like certain games that are set during wwii in germany are not subject of this investigation . 
  it 's `` simply '' an investigation whether it 's illegal that companies can prevent you from buying a game in poland ( or any other eu-country ) and activating it in germany . 
  for an explanation of the key points [ the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/02/brexit-white-paper-key-points-explained ) has your back, 
  [ what the us military would do in that situation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gh0ez5t.gif ) [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/combinedgifs/comments/5rgxp0/us_military_assists_lazy_sheep/ ), 
  could you provide a summary of what the two mep 's from romania are saying ( i 'm guessing ) in response to timmermans ? 
  are we doing houses now ? 
  did you read the article and see the quotes of economists that say that he 's wrong ? 
  apart from him being wrong of course ... 
   8 points apparently, 
  of course europe is better that was never the question, 
  you might want to check what he 's actually saying ( via either vatican.va directly or radio vatican ) instead of relying on what the news wants him to have said through little one sentence soundbites . 
  i 'm not saying he is conservative but calling him left goes a bit far . 
   its called tor and it sucks . 
  that 's why i said that i 'm still waiting . 
   there will never kotor 3 . 
  we once thought there would never be a new star wars movie ... then they ( eps 1-3 ) came along and mostly sucked but we still did n't give up hope and now we have new and better ones . 
  i 'm still here waiting for a sequel, 
   the left-wing wo n't like this . 
  it 's not like the church particularly cares about what the left thinks ... 
  if we deserve you we 're more fucked than the americans under trump, 
  is this your joke ? 
   one of the leaders of the far right movement in germany is alternative f\u00fcr deutschland ( alternative for germany ) or afd . 
  the party , which has called for tighter controls on immigration and has adopted an anti-islam policy , missed the five per cent mark needed to enter parliament in the last federal elections in 2013 , but made gains in regional elections last year and ** is set to be a big political force in september 's elections . 
  ** [ hightlight by me ] no they 're not, 
  that 's a castle not cattle ... get with the times, 
  as long as we do n't need to build an airport for them ... 
  do n't you know , we did that in the knowledge that trump would win of course . 
  he was obviously the only candidate fit for the office and to commemorate his awesomeness and his phenomenal victory we decided to increase the budget beforehand . 
  * according to the article hollande told trump about the negative political and economical consequences of protectionism and he also appealed for the compliance with democratic principles for instance the willingness to accept refugees . 
  * though to be honest whatever happens hollande is gone come april , so i do n't think it 's necessarily a sign of a backbone . 
  there is a great song by the german band [ santiano ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waugij7lhac ) based on the poem `` trutz , blanke hans '' by detlev von liliencron about rungholt , the major city on strand . 
  though the poem itself was also made into a song by [ achim reichel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i6txkrx9a8 ) . 
   no euratom members not being in the eu since when is switzerland in the eu ? 
  neither is euratom  the future of the euratom treaty unlike the ec treaty , no major changes have ever been made to the euratom treaty , which remains in force . 
  the european atomic energy community has not merged with the european union and therefore retains a separate legal personality , while sharing the same institutions . 
  [ ... ] [ euratom treaty ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:xy0024 ), 
   eu lawyers had long concluded that article 50 notification would apply to the euratom treaty but is n't euratom a separate entity from the eu . 
  it had its separate treaty not directly connected with the treaty of rome and it kept being a separate entity even after the merger treaty even though it shares now much of its structure with the eu . 
  whenever i read the word `` scheme '' the first thing i think is that it 's something bad like the ponzi scheme for instance i 'm not sure why . 
  but btt it 's a good idea that it 's actually getting tested outside the us for once . 
  the idea of a citizen 's dividend or a negative income tax ( as thought up by milton friedman ) has been around long enough . 
  and with the steady rise of automation where we can say [ robots took our jobs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tol1txrla1c ) we 're going to have have an open discussion about implementing ideas like this . 
  are they going to withdraw from cern and the other research projects too ? 
   coal and steel does not really contribute much in poland due to massive restrictions such as necessity of using certified equipment , filters etc. 
  that might be true today . 
  but back when the ruhr was still the industrial heart of germany built on steel and coal and heavy industry in general and gr\u00f6nemeyer wrote his great [ hymn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtd9bg9s85u ) things were different . 
  there were basically no restriction because people only began to realise then that it might not be a good idea to put all that shit either in the air or in the rivers without any filters . 
  that was the time when enviromentalism became the new thing and groups like greenpeace were founded . 
  though of course catastrophes like the sandoz chemical spill in 1986 when the rhine turned red did their part too . 
  i 'd love to see how that map would have looked like back when the ruhr area still had it 's old coal and steel industry . 
  today all is green with a few yellow sings , back then it must have been at least red if not whatever that colour is that they 're using for `` very unhealthy '' . 
  and for those who do n't know coburg in upper franconia , that 's the veste coburg one of the largest castles in germany, 
  is it our fault the us ca n't manipulate mexicans more efficiently ? 
  while not the first one but the one song that put hip hop and rap on the map in germany is probably [ die da ?!? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9lqelwqzr0 ) though that was in 1992 . 
  we have one , his name is [ david o'sullivan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_o'sullivan_ ( civil_servant \\ ) ), 
  no idea what you 're on about but i upvote you just for tintin and ( in english apparently ) snowy . 
  yeah i was n't sure myself to be honest, 
  but unlike the castle the car company does n't exist anymore . 
  though to be fair it is n't exactly a great loss having driven in one . 
  you should it 's an interesting place, 
  it 's a website that teaches you languages and includes a number of european languages .
