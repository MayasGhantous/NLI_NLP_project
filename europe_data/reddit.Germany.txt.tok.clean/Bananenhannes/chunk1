there is a difference between living in a country and being its citizen . 
  in germany to get the citizenship you have to - live at least 8 years in germany - speak german ( there is a test which several germans would fail ) - have an income ( no , welfare doesnt count ) and then they can vote . 
  besides that : let there be 50 % of those who get a citizenship voting for their own party . 
  in an election they wont get over 5 % . 
  wow , they didnt even put germany on the list . 
  :d we are one of the leading nations in terms of economy but are not able to build up fast internet connections . 
  i mean 50mbit by 2018 ... this is a joke and i think we might wo n't even reach this goal . 
   100/100 connection at home although 300/300 is also available  400/100 connection is also available what ?!, 
  here in germany the fastest connection is 100mbit/40mbit ( with vdsl ) or 150mbit/25mbit ( with cable ) to get a faster connection you need fiber to home ( ftth ) which is available for less than 1 % of the population ( and even with ftth the fastest connection available is 200mbit ) i am sitting here with a 16mbit connection which only delivers 11mbit . 
  yeah , but its not 800,000 a year , its 800.000 in this year . 
  just look at the early 90s . 
  there also came massive amounts of refugees caused by conflicts in yugoslavia . 
  this wave was stopped because the conflicts ended and there was a change in the asylum politics . 
  i dont think that the war in syria will last 25 years and we can start sending the refugees from the balkans back . 
  those two groups are about 80 % of the 800.000 that come to germany .

  you really call this fat thursday in poland ? 
  interesting , cause today is fettdonnerstag ( = fat thursday ) in aachen . 
  but the term is very regional , in most other cities in the rrhine area its called `` altweiber '' or `` weiberfastnacht '' .

   a patriot is someone who loves his fatherland , a nationalist is someone who despises the fatherlands of the others . 
  yep , but theres a problem , if you let your fatherland become a big part of your identity . 
  people always like to present themselves good in front of other people , and its a very easy way to show how good you are , if you just make others look worse . 
  with your nation being a big part of your identity this can lead to despising other countries , which is called nationalism . 
  this is not the case for every patriot , but the transition to a nationalist isnt that clear . 
   the use of such force is legal in germany should a person not comply to the border authorities by trying to escape the identification or search of their vehicle and luggage after verbal warning and a warning shot . 
  its not that clear . 
  the federal court of justice once stated that :  in der bundesrepublik deutschland der schu\u00dfwaffengebrauch gegen menschen angesichts seiner unkontrollierbaren gef\u00e4hrlichkeit ( vgl . 
  shortly translated to : you arent allowed to shoot at borders unless there is a danger to live for other people going out from this person . 
  [ here is the ( interesting ) article ] ( http://blogs.deutschlandfunk.de/berlinbruessel/2016/01/30/schusswaffengebrauch-an-der-grenze/ ) ( in german ) . 
  you are right with petry , she did n't explicitly call to shoot refugees , she called for the use of weapons , but shooting refugees is the consequence when you stop them with weapons . 
  btw . 
  `` people arriving from austria , have no right to asylum ( article 16 para . 
  you have to refuse their entry ( 18 para .

  one lonely sunday i read [ about nederlands grammar ] ( http://www.grammatiken.de/niederlaendische-grammatik-online-lernen/niederlaendisch-sprache-lernen-germanische-sprache-sprachfamilien-geschichte-ursprache-indogermanisch.php ) and this relly helped understanding how the language works .

  yep , there apparently exist a few [ `` fietssnelwegen '' ] ( http://www.fietssnelwegen.nl/index.php?m=2 ) and many more are planned .

  but you have read the questions that where asked , havent you ? 
  theres a chart especially for * refugees from war zones * , and a chart for all refugees from africa and middle-east . 
  in my opinion its pretty clear which type of refugees are meant with that . 
  but they dont know what the potential terrorists will do instead , after the stadium is evacuated . 
  somewhere else he said that you should avoid sticking together in huge groups of people on your way home from the stadium e.g. 
  the underground . 
  but nothing about suicidebombers, 
   i believe that the security of eu citizens is of utmost importance id say thats a rather bad principle . 
  if we would say security is the most important thing we want , we 'd be living in an authoritarian state and could just throw all our personal freedom aboard . 
  but our personal freedom is one thing that makes living in europe so great . 
  reinforcing border controls that are useful ( controlling every bigger road and not just controlling every tenth car or so ) in inner europe would mean giving up a big part of the freedom that europe stands for . 
  i do n't know where you are living , but i can get to 4 other countries in less then 1hour . 
  everybody living here does n't want to give this up .

  8 % is 8 % , it doesnt matter whether you consider it to be a lot or not . 
  properly estimating this would be saying its 8 % of the population . 
  saying 31 % are muslim is definitely not . 
  no , the time span differs . 
  its 2010-2015 for the injured and 2013-2015 in the graphic which shows the deaths . 
   you always have to take the good with the bad i.e. 
  the racism with the comparably cheap high quality education he was taking advantage of . 
  what ? 
  hes now living in the golden first world with our nice social system , so a little racism is ok ? 
  no , racism is never ok , we got laws like the grundgesetz in germany and the constitution in austria , its simply illegal . 
  what comes next ? 
  `` this immigrant takes advantage of our education , so its ok to break into his house and steal something '' ? 
   just look at 3rd generation turkish immigrants . 
  there grandparents came here 50 years ago and a big amount of them is n't assimilated the slightest . 
  and that after 50 years . 
  these people exist , it 's sad and sometimes infuriating , but how big is this group . 
  i mean those , whose behaviour has n't changed anywhere . 
  most of them integrate and change their culture . 
  that again does n't have to mean that they totally give up their old traditions . 
  for example : here in aachen there are currently 31 % people with an immigration background ( when you go back 2 generations ) , but it 's still just a normal german city . 
  the ib does n't openly say that ( instead of maybe hitler when he wrote mein kampf ) , `` muslims are bad guys '' . 
  but they talk about enemy 's in ones one country , and in the same moment they talk about mass-immigration . 
  they always suggest , that muslims are bad guys , and that we have to defend ourselves from them . 
  check their facebook page . 
  to the refugee crisis . 
  yes , demographics change , when so many people come here . 
  but the ib thinks , that for some reason , different cultures `` fight '' against , and that the `` german culture '' gets replaced . 
  i ca n't see that german traditions die , only because there is now also a bigger muslim group in germany . 
  yes , and they do so , cause because their ideology is racist . 
  they assign values to different cultures ( muslims are criminal and against women rights ) and people who are born in a culture ca n't change that . 
  they also want the people to take actions against the `` death of the german culture '' , which they think is happening . 
  they also have connections to neonazis which are already observed .
