well the perpetrators in those cases were propably not germans . 
  most likely also not people from france , netherlands , denmark , poland or czechia . 
  so i would n't describe that as `` youth in germany '' . 
  i would find other words for that ... 
  most likely legia warsaw ultras . 
  just look at the sticker on the 2nd picture . 
  and if you are not coming to us , we will come to you !, 
  be very afraid !, 
  ( of course we only come for holidays on beautiful beaches and to enjoy some wine and souvlaki . 
  but still . 
  be very afraid ! ), 
  if this was an online game , i would say greece is very , very salty xd, 
  the most ridiculous proposal is that he wanted to forbid `` sexist '' advertisment . 
  this is bullsh * t on so many levels . 
  first of all the substance of this proposal is very questionable . 
  second it would be almost impossible to make a law out of that . 
  where is the line between sexist and non sexist . 
  to make it seem like he is doing something . 
  http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-04/justiz-heiko-maas-tv-uebertragungen-gericht-verbot the murder proposal has also some serious flaws . 
  it may be right that the paragraph needs some reforms , but i absolutely disagree with maas proposal . 
  the reduction of the sentence to 5 years if someone was `` heavily insulted '' or in `` serious rage '' is imho a bad joke to me . 
  so there might be people that approve that proposal , which is fine to me . 
  i think it will be a minority of the votership that agrees with this proposal , but it is nevertheless a legitimate view . 
  i did n't even debate the other proposals because they are just ridiculous in my eyes . 
  so out of 3 proposals there were 2 silly proposals and 1 proposal where a lot of the voters fundamentally disagree . 
  not what i expect from a good minister of justice . 
  come on heiko maas is basically the archetype of an idiotic politician . 
  all his weird proposals are nothing more than smoke grenades to distract the general public from other problems . 
  like the refugee crisis and his role in it . 
  or the new years eve incidents in cologne . 
  he has such a negative image and the last time he got in the public news it was because of that actress chick he is now dating . 
  obviously in this time it is not the best thing for the image as a minister of justice to be seen as some kind of b prominent that only appears in tabloids because of the actress he is dating . 
  so imho all his proposals are his desperate try to make it seem like he is actually doing something as minister . 
  sadly for him all the proposals are quite stupid and badly thought out . 
  so most people realize that they are probably just for heiko maas ' image . 
  therefore -  idiotic politician . 
  we tried that some time ago . 
  but you guys did n't seem to like it . 
  lol , that is some creative approach to make it seem like there is no problem with criminal foreigners . 
  i can do that as well : nigeria has a higher gdp than qatar . 
  concluion : nigerians must be richer than people from qatar xd, 
  the current politics remind me more and more of my history classes . 
  swap the treaty of versailles with the mass migration and you are almost back in weimar . 
  historically speaking this was exactly one of the big factors that led to hitler 's rise ( beside some other aspects , like the treaty of versaille ) . 
  in germany there was a proportional representation in the parliament . 
  that led to many smaller parties in the parliament and there were no clear majorities . 
  this led to unstable coalitions and a political parties that blocked themselves . 
  from the left there were the communists that opposed democracy and from the right it was the nationalist parties and later the nsdap . 
  the democratic parties were n't able to form stable governments and win the people for the democratic parties . 
  this and the economic crisis started a downfall where the democratic parties constantly lost votes and the extremists ( communists and nsdap ) gained the votes . 
  if a country has a really , really unstable government and a slow political system that blocks itself , the people tend to turn away from the `` inefficient '' democracy . 
  instead they favoured a strong leader , with a stable government , that ca n't be blocked through `` inefficient '' democratic processes . 
  the success of hitler was in a big part also the failure of the democratic politicians . 
  feel free to draw conclusions from that . 
  that is a lame cartoon with an old overused joke . 
  i agree it 's not good and has a rather lame punchline . 
  but you do n't need to speak german to get the joke . 
  you do n't even need to know who hitler was . 
  this joke is so simple and understandable that even a child without knowledge about hitler would understand it . 
  it 's basically : `` guy holds a speech infront of many people . 
  he forgets his trousers . 
  he is naked . 
  he pees himself . 
  haha . '', 
  the [ core of this joke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_emperor's_new_clothes ) is several hundred years old . 
  thats a bad joke but it 's not nearly as wtf as op 's video and some of the links in this thread . 
  and yes i know ... germans and humor :d :d :d, 
  finland -  good guys -  germany -  allied with finland -  germany was on the side of the good guys -  hooray !, 
  yes i know the lapland war . 
  but all those photos were taken before that . 
  just let me have this beautiful illusion for a few moments , 
  wtf estonia xd edit : [ best scene ] ( https://youtu.be/gchpjnrrwk8?t=1m20s ), 
   we are at home . 
  we are the hosts . 
  our rights should have a priority . 
  i totally agree . 
  we can help people who are really persecuted . 
  but to do so , we do n't need to let them come to europe . 
  the eu can establish refugee camps at the eu borders . 
  so we can give those shelter and safety that really need it without flooding europe with foreigners . 
   especially since his organisation still ** acknowledges democracy ** and the german state , i would n't want a member of ** antifa ** or die linke be unable to become a prosecutor either !, 
  wait you would be ok with someone frome the antifa taking that job ? 
  accepting our democracy ( fdgo ) and antifa usually do n't fit together . 
  he will do his job , which is to deport criminals . 
  people with another party affiliation ( espacially the greens and the left ) would most likely do everything to prevent people from getting deported . 
  do you mean the patriotism/nationalism part or the hitler part ? 
  ( i dunno if you are serious or if thats just the typical polish reflex on that topic ), 
  he is a professor for economics . 
  so he might know a thing or two . 
  is n't that basically the same ? 
  one nation in two different states . 
   its just that one fuckup does n't mean you had a change of heart . 
  the problem with merkel is that she does not have clear ideals . 
  she follows the trend which she thinks will give her the most approval . 
  so this time she thought left-wing policies will bring her the most votes . 
  and now she is backtracking for the same reason . 
  there are many more examples for this behaviour ( nuclear energy e.g. ) . 
  so i do n't see any future for merkel . 
  her party ( cdu ) however will most likely find back to it 's conservative roots . 
  however they lost a lot of trust .
