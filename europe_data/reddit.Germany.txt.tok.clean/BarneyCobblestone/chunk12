  it 's all about the definition of german nation . 
  i know your history after wwii and it was official policy to reject the idea of a german nation that might be bigger than the state federal republic of germany . 
  that 's ok , it is your state and you can do with it whatever you want . 
  but the unknowingness regarding this topic is quite high . 
  a good example is the story with hofer and his verbindung . 
  a german nation does n't mean anschluss or whatever . 
  it 's just a historic fact that germans and austrians have a lot more in common than just the language . 
  fun fact : vienna has been longer the de facto capital of `` germany '' ( as the habsburger home town in the holy roman empire ) than berlin . 
  just think about it : with which country do you have the most in common : italy , france , czechia or maybe germany ? 
  well that 's the drawback when your native language is spoken everywhere . 
  you will get your grammar corrected by foreigners , 
  i do n't know how serious that statement is and how much or how little you know about bismarck and his policy . 
  bismarck should have never be fired by wilhelm ii and wilhelm ii should have never left the path of bismarck 's foreign policy . 
  i 'm pretty sure that there would n't have been a wwi in this extend , if wilhelm ii had followed bismarck 's foreign policy . 
  bismarck was a pragmatist through and through . 
  yes he also had an instinct for power but he was no one that would go on risky adventures . 
  he knew about the fragile balance of power in europe and also knew about the position germany had in europe . 
  with the power that germany had but also with the risks of an encirclement of germany . 
  it was exactly this kind of pragmatic politician that was missing in germany ( and probably also most other countries ) in the time prior to wwi . 
   things were going pretty well until hitler decided to invade countries ww2 also went well until italy started to decide to invade another country ( you know which country i talk about ) as well and failed horribly . 
  and also failed on every other front they were fighting . 
   hate the germans for the war ** and ** for taking the duce away from them . 
  well you have to pick one . 
  both at the same time is pretty much stupid . 
  and you definetly ca n't blame the third reich for taking the duce ** away ** . 
  yeah , history showed that the treaty of versailles and the enormous reparations were totally a good idea / s, 
   well , then stop acting as if we owe you anything . 
  i did n't do that . 
  i do n't know how widespread this `` reparation '' thing is in poland , but it 's simply leading nowhere in todays europe . 
  pretty much every european country has an open account with another european country . 
  so if you want to claim your outstanding balance , than the other country will claim their outstanding balance as well . 
  so either you keep opening your historic accounts , or you let it be bygones , and enjoy european integration , european cooperation , european peace and the other stuff . 
  i was a bit rude as well , so apologies for that . 
  but i 'm getting seriously mad if other countries come up with their bullsh * t war claims against germany , after decades of european integration and the eu . 
   your choice , adolf . 
  a bad mannered pole . 
  no surprise . 
  and you want to talk about people forced out ... 
  listen . 
  we live in a european union now . 
  so if you let bygones be bygones , i 'm fine with that . 
  but if you want to bring up stuff from the past , because you want reparations , then i start bringing up stuff from the past as well . 
  it 's easy as that . 
  like i said , it 's your choice . 
  that 's those regions where the language was german around 1900 . 
  so if you want to talk about reparations , thats fine . 
  but then we talk about this land . 
  your choice , pole .

  if you wan na start talking about reparations , we maybe should start talking about pommern and schlesien . 
  those refugees should n't stay permanently in greece . 
  you would need some time to establish eu-financed refugee camps outside europe . 
  if the eu would give that a high priority you could probably build those camps within 1 year . 
  until then you would have to keep the borders closed and detain all incoming refugees . 
  so the number in greece would depend on how many refugees can slip past the greek border controls . 
  i just assumed a bad case scenario of 1 million new arrivals or even more . 
  after the camps are set up , you could start deporting all the refugees to those eu-financed refugee camps . 
  until then every country has to keep the refugees that are already there . 
  unfortunately greece would need to shelter the incoming refugees for 1 year , until the eu-financed refugee camps are set up and then it could deport those refugees to the eu-financed refugee camps . 
  germany alone plans to spend [ 93 billion $ ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-costs-iduskcn0y50dy ) on refugees . 
  and thats just the amount that only germany plans to spend . 
  i think with less money thant that , you could probably : - house and shelter 1-2 million refugees in greece . 
  if european military would work together you could easily set up tent cities in rural areas in greece . 
  - pay greece a big a big rent for the land that is rented to build those detainment camps . 
  additionally there could and should be a payment as a compensation . 
  - pay north-african countries to rent land for the eu refugee camps - establish eu financed refugee camps in those countries - support greece 's , italy 's and spain 's border security and you probably would even have some money left . 
  and remember those 93 billion , are only what germany alone plans to spend . 
  i would prefer to send them to eu-financed refugee camps outside the eu to erase any incentive to come to europe . 
  if those refugees want shelter and safety , they do n't need to go to germany . 
  if they are n't happy with shelter and safety , then they are no refugees . 
  probably italy . 
  nice beaches and warm weather . 
  if you had enough of that you can go to the alps or enjoy culturally rich cities . 
  the only way to reduce the number of death in the mediterranean sea is to adapt australian refugee politics . 
  australia does not give refugee to anyone coming to australia . 
  instead their boats are escorted back to the countries they came from . 
  if thats not possible , those people are detained on an island next to australia . 
  additionally to that the australian government makes campaigns in the refugee countries , that the refugees are not welcome in australia . 
  with this policy australia managed to decrease the number of drowned refugees to almost 0 . 
  so europe should do the same . 
  make a campaign of anti-advertisment of immigration to europe . 
  detain all refugees . 
  finance eu-refugee camps outside the eu and send all refugees back to those camps . 
  erase any incentive for those people to come and provide basic refugee-camps outside europe for the real refugees . 
  i do n't know the name , but i allways liked wir sind kaiser . 
  the show was so good and the kaiser absolutely hilarious . 
   maybe she 's just too long been the chancellor i think that as well . 
  imho there should be a limitation to two terms of chancellorship , like in the usa . 
  power corrupts and there is a good reason to replace political leaders from time to time . 
  it 's amazing to see how some people love languages and have a talent to learn languages . 
  i know some people in uni that speak 4 languages fluently . 
  i learned english and latin at school . 
  i absolutely hated latin and only learned english because it is simply a necessity . 
  later in uni i tried to learn some spanish beside my main subject . 
  but i skipped this as well , because i suddenly remebered why i hate learning languages . 
  so i think it 's amazing if people know a lot languages . 
  but i 'm somehow glad that we have an international second language in which almost everybody can communicate ( even if it is n't german , just kidding xd ) . 
  so i 'm fine with speaking only english as a foreign language . 
  i know you meant that as a joke but i 'm so glad there is an alternative for germany ( the afd party , for anyone not getting it ) now . 
  prior to that , merkel did n't have to fear to lose the votes of conservative voters .
