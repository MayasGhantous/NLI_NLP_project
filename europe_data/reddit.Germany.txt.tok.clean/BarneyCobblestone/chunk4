  it 's hard to argumente against the general consensus , so it 's an easy argumentation to tell `` hey , its about free trade '' . 
  but imho it totally is n't . 
   you act like all decisions can be reduced to what the population wants . 
  not all decisions . 
  but a lot decisions can be and should be . 
  at least in a democracy . 
   can you force ethnical germans to get more children or other people in germany to get less ? 
  you can set incentives . 
  not according to ethnicity but according to citizenship . 
  you can offer tax exemptions , child money , childcare , free education and so on . 
  and you can connect that to german citizenship , or eu citizenship , or some kind of green card and so on . 
   can you deny people an asylum that our laws assure them ? 
  ** no one ** and i really mean ** no one ** that came through the balcan route had a legal claim for asylum in germany . 
  look up the drittstaatenregelung ( third-country clause ) . 
  beside that asylum about shelter and safety . 
  and refugees do n't necessary have to be in europe to find that . 
  the eu could set up refugee centers in north africa , where refugees find safety and shelter . 
  that would still be cheaper than having them here . 
   can you force people to stay in the countries they were born in ? 
  well you can prevent them from entering your country or the eu . 
  how ? 
  build a fence . 
  worked in macedonia . 
  or simply send back everyone that illegally comes to europe . 
  you see you actually can enforce all those policies . 
  it is just the political will that is lacking . 
  * internet discussion strategy 101 : when in doubt about anything , simply accuse the other person of not knowing the meaning of a certain word . 
  * just for you : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_group https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnicity_ ( disambiguation ), 
  what she says indicates that she actively supports the policy that will lead to those results . 
  and those results will not only affect her but everybody who is living in germany . 
  the only thing good about stefanie von berg is , that at least she is honest about her intentions . 
  i hypothesize that at no time since 1949 there was a majority in germany that wanted to allow foreign mass migration to germany . 
  yet there has been a constant migration of foreigners to germany . 
  how do you think the following hypothetical referendum would turn out : `` do you want a policy that will make germans no longer a majority in german cities ? '', 
  yes - - - no, 
  nah , it 's not that i dislike turkish people or other foreigners . 
  i just think that every society has a capacity on how many foreigners it can integrate . 
  and in germany we are way above that capacity . 
  if we could send two non-integratable turks back , for every good turk we let in i would personally welcome op ( given he is a good guy ) . 
  for now the boat is not only full , but way above it 's safe capacity . 
  i do n't think that is a good comparison . 
  brexit was a yes - no question , while a political party has a lot of opinions on politics . 
  and virtually no voter does 100 % agree with everything a party stands for . 
  for me it 's fine if i agree with lets say 70 % of the party program . 
  but a yes - no referendum is something different . 
  and if we had a yes - no referendum on muslim immigration i 'm quite sure how it would turn out . 
   what is this ? 
  like most europeans look like . 
  you speak german , so i assume you know how central europeans look like . 
  im not surprised , this is written by a german speaker . 
  most other nations in europe ( or probably in the world ) do n't consider their own ethnicity as something bad . 
  but well , some germans are so full of self-hate and self-loathing of their own existance they even voted for stefanie von berg . 
  just do n't come to germany . 
  there are already too many turkish foreigners here . 
  `` i think that in 20 or 30 years we wont have ethinc [ german ] majorities in our city . 
  [ ... ] that is a good thing ! '', 
  [ stefanie von berg , green mp in the city parliament of hamburg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-kafrbdxmi ), 
   we are n't being flooded with muslim immigrants ... you are ... that 's what i was implying with my 2nd paragraph . 
  a german politician should n't dare to attack trump for being `` dangerous to europe '' while germany gets flooded with muslims . 
  a big amount of the criticism trump gets here in germany is because his immigration policies . 
  and it is n't criticised that the way he wants to stop illegal immigration is inefficient ( i 'm not into the us situation so i wo n't argue if the wall is efficient or not ) . 
  the criticism is mainly aimed at the fact that he wants to prevent illegal immigration and is reluctant to muslim immigration . 
  considering the situation in germany/europe than german politicians are well advised to keep their mouth shut and do n't dare to criticise anyone on that topic . 
  we have a saying that goes : `` you should sweep infront of your own door first . '', 
  and apparently steinmeier is n't doing that at all . 
   `` yes , merkel is destroying our country but shame on you if you do n't see that as a necessary evil . '', 
  those people do n't consider destroying germany as a necessary evil . 
  those people consider that to be a good thing . 
  [ green party chairwoman claudia roth on a demonstration . ], 
  ( https://lupocattivoblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/deutschland-verrecke.jpg ) the banner says `` never again germany '' . 
  a slogan used by left-wing extremists that call for the `` death of germany '' and the `` abolishment of germany '' . 
  well you can vote on it . 
  you just have to vote for the right parties . 
  front national , afd , fp\u00d6 , swedendemocrats and so on . 
  those parties do n't even need to get the majority . 
  their presence alone is often enough to discipline the governement . 
   german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has warned that a donald trump presidency `` would be dangerous not only for the united states , but for europe and the rest of the world as well . ''  steinmeier said he was concerned about trump 's `` politics of fear and isolation '' in which way is it dangerous to prevent uncontrolled illegal immigration ? 
  in which way is it dangerous to reduce your military presence on another continent ? 
  apparently flooding a country with muslim immigrants makes it somehow miraculously safer . 
  or simply do n't let muslim refugees/migrants come to your country . 
  then you do n't face any of those problems in the first place . 
  it is not surprising that those muslim terrorist attacks take place in countries with a high muslim population . 
  how many muslim terrorist attacks have happened in poland , hungary or lithuania ? 
  well the main point is in the speach . 
  the eu is in denial . 
  it is in denial about it 's lack of legimation and it 's lack of democracy . 
  the eu has a parliament that is essentially powerless . 
  the commission is n't elected by the parliament or ( how absurd ) the voters . 
  when national governments sometimes have the problem that they are too far away from the population , then the eu has the problem multiplied by a thousand . 
  and if the people actually can vote on a treaty ( treaty of lissabon ) then their vote is simply ignored . 
  that does n't help to see the eu as a legitimate democratic institution . 
  those are all valid concerns . 
  but the heads of the eu do n't give a sh * t about that . 
  here is a nice quite by juncker :  `` we decide on something , leave it lying around and wait and see what happens . 
  if no one kicks up a fuss , because most people do n't understand what has been decided , we continue step by step until there is no turning back . '', 
   - jean-claude juncker this is basically the president of the european commission saying : we do n't care what the people want . 
  we just fool them so we can do what we want . 
  and that is exactly the attitude of the eu . 
  there are still people that wonder why the eu is disliked so much , despite all the advantages it brings . 
  well , this is the reason .
