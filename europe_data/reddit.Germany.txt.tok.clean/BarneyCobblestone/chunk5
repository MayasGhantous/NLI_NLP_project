  but it 's not up to me to shout for reforms for the eu . 
  that is the duty of all pro-eu-people . 
  if they do n't do it , then nobody will do it and more and more people will turn away from the eu . 
  and that will lead to more countries leaving the eu . 
  simple . 
  i would be fine with that as well . 
  you will get beer and pork no matter who joins who . 
  so everythings fine . 
  well a lot of things he said are true . 
  if established politics or pro-eu-people ignore that or take his statement as the `` stupid rambling of a political weirdo '' the eu might get into even deeper problems in the future . 
  the brexit ca n't be labeled as `` stupid people voting wrong '' . 
  there are rational reasons for the brexit and those come from serious flaws in the european union . 
  ignoring those problems will not make them go away . 
  it will just make them more severe . 
  it 's the pro-eu-people that need to adress the eu 's problems and flaws . 
  if those problems are n't corrected , then the anti-eu-people just need to lean back and wait for the whole thing to collapse . 
  rip, 
  why not chinese , urdu , bantu or another random non-european language ? 
  but yeah it 's probably just because of racism , we all know that everything is racist nowadays ... 
  haha , when i had latin in school i was always close to failing . 
  so i had to cheat a bit and used caesars [ de bello gallico ] ( http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/jcsr/dbg1.htm ) ( the gallic wars ) as inspiration . 
  i bet i made tons of grammatical errors . 
  translation for uncivilized barbarians : the holy roman empire of european nation as a whole , is divided in 27 parts , where the first is inhabited by belgians , second by germans , third french , fourth italian , ... , twentyseventh by spanish . 
  those all have different languages , customs and ~ ~ laws ~ ~ ( not if the hreoen harmonizes the laws ) . 
  the holy roman empire of european nation spreads from the river narva until the part of the ocean that borders to spain . 
  the whole holy roman empire of european nation speaks one langue . 
  the language of the holy roman empire of european nation is latin . 
  first official act : destroy carthage, 
  and the slogan will be s.p.q.e. 
  i 'd say esperanto or latin . 
  that is basically [ esperanto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esperanto ), 
  quite an interesting source , especially because you can see the historical bomb maps . 
  that would fit into r/mapporn . 
  are unexploded bombs still an issue in london ? 
  that 's just a money grab . 
  and from a pure business view that 's also a pretty clever money grab . 
  wow , those numbers definetly are insane . 
  especially the part about the canadian corps starting at 3:30 is pretty interesting . 
  another related fact : there are still tons of landmines left over from the yugoslavia war . 
  an estimated 120.000 landmines in bosnia and 13.000 in croatia . 
  a quick google search showed that three people of a bomb disposal unit died 2010 in g\u00f6ttingen , while they tried to dispose a 500kg bomb . 
  dunno if that 's the latest death , but that 's what google showed me . 
  slightly related to the topic : when there is construction-work in german cities , they regularly find bombs from ww2 . 
  there are still tons of unexploded bombs laying under densly populated german cities . 
  for most cities the strategy is that whenever there is construction work , they check the ground for bombs . 
  so part by part they are cleaning up the ground . 
  additionally they used to have bomb screenings where they used ww2 photographies that the bombers made to evaluate their hits . 
  well to be fair , merkel tries to push a european solution via the eu that would force countries to take in refugees . 
  the european distribution of refugees would mean that those countries had to take in refugees . 
  there have been plans that a country would have to pay a fine of 250.000 $ ( a quarter million $ !!! ), 
  per refugee if it does n't fulfill it 's refugee quota . 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/commission-wants-to-make-eu-countries-pay-for-not-accepting-refugees/ so the concern that the eu will foster forced refugee intake from muslim countries is definetly very real . 
  i think this is simply the backlash you have to expect when you extremly overdo something . 
  britain as well as a lot of european countries overdid enormously with legal and illegal immigration . 
  a lot of people were criticising the the problems of immigration since many years . 
  the complete retardedness with the uncontrolled illegal inflow of refugees was just the last drop that made it spill over . 
  there is nothing wrong with immigration per se or having a certain percantage of foreigners in your country . 
  but if politicians from all parties agree to take in more and more and more foreigners while ignoring the will of the voters , then you have to expect such kind of thoughts sooner or later . 
  former german chancellor helmut schmidt said 1981 ( !!!, 
  ) : * `` we ca n't digest more foreigners , that will lead to murder and killing . 
  '' * ( murder and killing is a saying and not meant literally ) and in 2004 he said : * `` with a democratic society , the concept of multiculturalism is difficult to reconcile . 
  maybe in a very long term . 
  but if you ask , where multicultural societies have so far worked , you can get very quickly to the conclusion that they only work there peacefully where there is a strong authoritarian state there . 
  so , it was a mistake that we picked up at the beginning of the 60 's guest workers from foreign cultures into the country . 
  well merkels invitation to refugees and the call for a european solution , did n't exactly help . 
  i said quite a while ago , that merkel will be the best campaigner for brexit . 
  if you associate the eu with uncontrolled refugee intake and forced distribution of unwanted refugees to eu countries , then you are way more likely to vote for brexit . 
  if you are not a citizen of the uk then you are simply a guest for time in the country . 
  the uk has no responsibility on foreign citizens . 
  no country in europe has any responsibility for foreign citizens as long as they are not eu citizens . 
  so there is no problem on sending those people back . 
  if they planned to live in the uk forever they should have applied for a citizenship . 
   if you really like shady backroom deals between the executive powers is that a big difference to the european council ? 
  i once read an interesting article that argumented that the demise of the roman empire is the collective childhood trauma of europe . 
  so there were a lot of unconscious attempts to restore the roman/european empire in it 's former glory . 
  that being said , i would totally be in for the holy roman empire of european nation . 
  not for use . 
  but if we would get the holy roman empire of european nation , i would be definetly in . 
  [ onward to glory fellow europeans . ], 
  the migrant crisis was a political problem . 
  however the eu did n't manage to solve it in any way . 
  it was action by v4 and austria , that stopped the migrant flow . 
  same with ukraine . 
  a political problem but the eu did n't really seem to care . 
   national governments meeting and coordinating themselves is basically what the eu is right now . 
  why does the eu need a budget then ? 
  if it 's just coordination for national governments all it would take was an office building in which the governments can meet from time to time . 
  each country pays for their own employees and there is no need to give the eu a budget . 
  so then it should n't be a problem to reduce the european union to a simple economic union . 
  there is no need for a political union then . 
  national governments can meet and coordinate themselves without a political union . 
   considering that eu institutions are powerless without cooperation of the national governments , the only thing the commission and parliament could do is sit and watch . 
  well , one might ask why we need the eu then ? 
  a trade agreement or an agreement like schengen does n't require a political union . 
  yep , exactly my thought . 
  `` brexit could be an opportunity for europe , ** if ** we know how to seize it '' that 's a very big ** if ** . 
  considering how `` good '' the eu is at seizing opportunities than it well let this opportunity pass . 
  the only `` opportunity '' the eu ( or better merkel ) seized , was flooding europe with foreigners . 
  i just do n't know if that was good for the native european population . 
  religion is imho heavily influencing culture and values .
