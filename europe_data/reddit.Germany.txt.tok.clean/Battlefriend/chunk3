  if your claim is less than legit , you are under the very real threat of prison or deportation from turkey , which is notoriously worse than the eu . 
  that is a big added hurdle on the way to europe . 
  europe , in turn , gets managable , predetermined groups of people that can be more easily registered at the airports . 
  how is that not a win for the eu ? 
  the systems within the union are n't perfect , but it 's a massive step up from the situation before . 
  it probably makes sense for him to not look like a complete pawn to the eu . 
  he does n't have any real power yet out of tripoli . 
  the unity government is of course willing to take our 100 million in aid , i assume . 
  could you expand how the number of migrants does n't decrease ? 
  the number of people heading to greece from turkey decreases , so the number of people being sent to europe decreases . 
  yes , for now , people still enter the eu . 
  but at 300 a day , the eu has 210 days to convey the message : `` if you illegally travel to greece you will pay for somebody else to enter europe , not you . '' . 
  once that is common knowledge among asylum seekers , the numbers should drop to zero . 
  in my opinion , the author seriously misreads the value the deal has to the eu and the threat the union has been under . 
  were the eu as close a union as the united states , for example , it would be more shameful to abandon basic principle . 
  but it is not . 
  this crisis had very real potential to kill the eu as a whole . 
  in that regard , the deal was like a chemo drug : fundamentally poisonous , but necessary to survive . 
  the eu has begun tackling this problem nine months ago , see here [ eu navfor med sophia ] ( https://wikileaks.org/eu-military-refugees/eeas/eeas-2016-126.pdf ) . 
  once you read the document and look into the results and future military commitments from the libyan peace conference in rome last winter , you get a clearer picture . 
  the recently deployed western-backed unity government in tripoli is n't some farce , it 's the first step in allowing us to tackle this problem head on with military force . 
  [ eu navfor med sophia ] ( https://wikileaks.org/eu-military-refugees/eeas/eeas-2016-126.pdf ) , in case anyone cares about the things the eu has already done and is planning to do in libya . 
  no , we 're actually starting our own , third government . 
  he does n't get his 6 billion unless there is significant reduction in the numbers . 
  the six billion are n't lump sum either , so he 'll have to continuously protect the border for money . 
  but if the mission progresses correctly , these sinking vessels will be picked up in libyas waters and returned to lybia . 
  in the document this refers to phase 2b . 
  maybe 12 million is n't enough , but considering the spending we 're currently doing for greece and turkey , i doubt there would be a lack of money . 
  this route is the next big problem we 'll all turn our attention to . 
  offer the recognized libyan government money and a `` training program '' which results in european navy vessels operating in libyan waters as coast guard . 
  then just turn the ships back and arrest the smugglers . 
  see [ eu navfor med sophia ] ( https://wikileaks.org/eu-military-refugees/eeas/eeas-2016-126.pdf ) . 
  our leaders have been preparing for this for a long time . 
  read the executive summary in this document : [ eu navfor med sophia ] ( https://wikileaks.org/eu-military-refugees/eeas/eeas-2016-126.pdf ) . 
  the mission in the aegean sea has the same blueprint . 
  the eu will do you one better . 
  check out the leaked report about [ eu navfor med sophia ] ( https://wikileaks.org/eu-military-refugees/eeas/eeas-2016-126.pdf ) . 
  if our diplomats are successful , nato ships will be allowed to patrol in libyan waters and send ships straight back to shore , without ever bringing them to europe . 
  well the nato mission at the turkish-greek border does exactly that . 
  its ' main purpose is to gather intelligence and arrest smugglers . 
  well , migrants from africa will be addressed by the separate eu navfor sophia , which i suspect will become a lot more important over the coming months , depending on the eu-libya diplomatic relations . 
  there are a number of factors that make violence less likely and less of a threat , imo :, 
  they do n't get to choose when they go back , the german government will decide that . 
  the refugees have no say in this . 
  so if assad stays but promises to maintain peace and not prosecute them , which he must to receive western funds for rebuilding syria , we will most likely begin sending everyone back . 
  [ this nyt ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/01/world/europe/how-the-paris-attackers-honed-their-assault-through-trial-and-error.html?ribbon-ad-idx=13&amp;rref=world/europe&amp;module=arrowsnav&amp;contentcollection=europe&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=fixedright&amp;pgtype=article ) article goes into great detail . 
  great , does n't change the underlying problem at all . 
  she does n't change tune . 
  as the article states , she 's calling for the enforcement of policy that was agreed upon on the last eu summit . 
  merkel always said that she is for a european solution . 
  how is asking people to do what the mutually agreed european solution says suddenly changing tune ? 
  the big difference between now and earlier seems to be that greece has agreed to this . 
  they also receive some aid money to relief their difficulties . 
  because if we did , the money could n't be used for breaches of non-refoulement , illegal imprisonment , bribes , subpar housing , education , jobs , etc. 
  we 're using turkey ( and morocco ) because we ca n't , or better , do n't want to do these things . 
  the only effective way to stop this flow is dirty . 
  europe does n't do dirty . 
  you 're right , italy used to block it , but [ not anymore ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35486655 ) . 
  [ this document ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information/docs/managing_the_refugee_crisis_-_eu-turkey_join_action_plan_implementation_report_20160210_en.pdf ) shows what actions were taken on both sides even before the transactions started . 
  at least some of the measures are concrete and observable , and the numbers in the document are promising . 
  finally , we will never be able to truly grasp what turkey does with the money , [ see here ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/business_unclear-how-turkey-will-use-3-bln-euro-fund-for-syrian-refugees_411458.html ) . 
  the shady idea behind that is to allow turkey to use the money for [ less humanitarian causes ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35135810 ) without requiring any form of eu investigation . 
  the funding for the 3 billion deal has been done and agreed upon for weeks now . 
  every eu member as well as the eu budget will contribute . 
  all eu nations agreed . 
  do you not see the problem with your statement ? 
  right now , spain and morocco have a deal that is very good to us . 
  spain does n't have to do most of the dirty work and should a migrant boat slip through it will be sent back immediately . 
  there are some thousand , maybe some ten thousand moroccans in europe . 
  after spanish guardia civil accidentally approached the king of morocco 's yacht on a drug patrol , the number of asylum seekers arriving via sea grew by 3.000 for a week . 
  a show of force against morocco means they let hundreds of thousands of migrants pass . 
  first of all , the negotiations with turkey are happening with eu-member consensus . 
  that is a terrible comparison . 
  what the people in these comments and the article itself are correctly saying is that the overall economic impact , however it may look like , is bigger in the uk . 
  maybe it 's a mostly positive impact , maybe it 's mostly negative . 
  if it 's mostly positive , no harm done , the eu can exist pretty ok without the uk . 
  if it 's mostly negative , uk is screwed , because it needs new eu deals to salvage the economy . 
  nobody will play nice in those negotiations . 
  but it is the only possible plan that will stop this crisis and the coming ones for good while also preserving the eu . 
  plus , we live in a globalized society and have a commitments to many other nations . 
  a national solution in this case simply makes no sense , because the disadvantages are overwhelming . 
  passports that originated from isis controlled areas . 
  huge difference . 
  but you have to be impressed with them . 
  nearly every eu-nation , even the ones without refugee problems , have pulled to the right , often for movements with cheap rhetoric and xenophobia . 
  the greeks stick with europe and their left-wing government . 
  she opposes specific numbers , especially if they are n't made in agreement with others . 
  she also said it worsens her position in the talks with erdogan . 
  she talked for a long time about solutions and the new german procedures , asylum laws and positions clearly prove that she wants to reduce the numbers of migrants and that the number is already lowered compared to previous months . 
  she has a plan , the deal with turkey , the nato mission and syria peace talks are her plan . 
  cooperation is central between france and germany , so why should they have the same priorities ? 
  true military cooperation should mean that not everyone does everything , but everyone specialises . 
  providing a complete plan , from refugees over the war to the rebuilding between two nations is great cooperation . 
  this article reads like this deadline is more about allowing other eu countries to continue their special schengen rules . 
  but regardless , turkey should be the one securing the border , greece the handling the asylum processes . 
  the right to asylum is still in national hands , is anything stopping greece from just restricting asylum to people who come with passport , language skills and stacks of letters from terrorists , government , police etc. 
  proving that they specifically are prosecuted ? 
  everybody else gets more or less dumped on an island . 
  even if the european court for human rights goes after them , just pay the fines and move on . 
  germany was , by the eu , required to store metadata some years ago .
