nasa support esa . 
  they are achieving great stuff as well . 
  coastline of italy : 7,600 kilometres, 
  iceland gdp : $ 17 billion russia gdp : $ 3.9 trillion about even , i would say . . 
   i ca n't imagine that someone stupid would be allowed to become the president of world 's 6th strongest country . 
  i do n't think politicians are as simple as common people . 
  great postmodernist architecture !, 
  i think this building is by ricardo bofill , who created the whole [ antigone quarter in montpellier . ],

  well , on that vulcanus you 're not going to live long and prosper ... 
  the area around neuschwanstein is perfect for half-day-hikes with 4-6 hours . 
  with both mountain - and valleytrails . 
  all the trails are well marked in maps and on the road . 
  i 'm not sure about guides , but near the castle and in f\u00fcssen , there are definetly big tourist-centers with information for international tourists . 
  [ there is also a website in german with alot of trails listed ] ( http://www.bergfex.de/sommer/fuessen-allgaeu/touren/wandern/ ), 
   terror , is from the french terreur , from latin terror meaning `` great fear '' , a noun derived from the latin verb terrere meaning `` to frighten '' , [ 1 ] is a policy of political repression and violence intended to subdue political opposition . 
  i was often there on vacation . 
  so beautiful !, 
  the water is just crystal-clear and cold as fuck ... but after a long hike , you 'll love it . 
  yesterday [ sam harris discussed with bill maher ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv7evvph69y&amp;ab_channel=realtimewithbillmaher ) this `` war of ideas '' on bills show ... and how political - and society mainstream is a cause to this problem . 
  2.20 min ... gawd !, 
  agree , there are plenty of better ones ^ ^ also : ^ ^ fickemamolgern ^ ^ die ^ ^ eintracht . 
  it was ugly as hell in the 60s/70s/80s ... but now it surely developed into a beautiful city ... and being from mainz , it gives me eternal agony admitting that . 
  til ... the fourth biggest export-goods from netherlands to ger is :  human or animal blood ... worth $ 5.59 b. 
  ok , what is going on here ? 
  you are right it 's hopeless ... [ this will never be a unified entity ] ( https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/b9e9677a-df16-4978-a6d3-83197f537459/817f3800482c145ec87639519926ff01.png ) . 
  * oh wait ... ... wrong map *, 
   an attack on one eu brigrade is an attack on all eu brigades , end of story . 
  combine that with the growing european-citizen identity , it even becomes : an attack on european soil , wherever , is an attack on me ... thats what the end product should be . 
  . . like a scene from hot shots, 
  well . . so no rendere l'europa di nuovo grande, 
  quick research : not enough time to do more ... 
  ancient japan : nanshoku-relationship , brotherhood contract - relationship ancient celts : society approved same sex relationships ( described by aristotle ) ancient greece : paiderastia - realtionship , sacred band of thebes, 
  ... if you look at the profiles of karesos , fornaxxs , gaussino , christianno11 . . all freshly made . 
  so they are either trolls , or vladis drink companions . 
  ok , after looking at your profile ... does the kremlin pay in euro or dollar ? 
  i think we mean two different things ... 
  i love the architecture not the engineering . 
   so how do you go about that without altering everything in a n m radius ? 
  by not doing it ? 
  as the elphi did ... instead use your enviroment . 
   choose a decent spot this is part of architecture . 
  drawing lines on paper is not everything . 
   they did n't build the river around that glass thingy either . 
  do you believe that this is its [ natural stream bed ? ], 
  ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/hamburger+hafen/@53.5330987,9.9662686,3545m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b184876a599be7:0x928d4aacd4e8f95e!8m2!3d53.5069321!4d9.9679781 ) it was altered long ago ... now you have to react to it . . and use the context . . 
  they can do that ... alot of times [ they do n't ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/17066106_303.jpg ) . 
  great architecture is not only about the structure but also about the context . 
  how a buidling does react with its enviroment ... like the water surface around the elbhi or the historic brick architecture of hamburg , but also the isolated standpoint and therefore amplified ambient light . 
  it means , that even in the rear seats you get the same experience , because the sonic waves spread out evenly from every single instrument to every single seat . 
  so there is no sound overlay and you get a direct sound with very few echos . 
  just saw on tv reaction-voices of the opening concert : musicians and audience were impressed by the acoustics , but its something both have to get used to ... since the acoustic is very direct and even . 
  nah , the melting-skyscraper philharmonie concept was already taken by the [ parisians ] ( http://www.musicalamerica.com/mablogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/philharmonie-de-paris-7.jpg ) , 
  the interaction with the [ ambient light ] ( http://seasidemagazin.de/wp-content/uploads/elbphilharmonie_hamburg_foto_maxim_schulz-2.jpg ) is what makes the building [ phenomenal . ], 
  ( http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/media/thumbs/d/dbba6ff9beacb55fddee04980cc1c528v1_max_755x425_b3535db83dc50e27c1bb1392364c95a2.jpg ), 
  the sydney opera house cost $ 102 million and was completed in 1973 . 
  the original plan was : a cost of $ 7 million and completion date of 26 january 1963 . 
  so the elbphilharmonie is in good tradition . 
  yes , but what about ** braveria ** ... is n't that the super brave bavaria ? 
  hey spain ... i 've heard that thailand has some ... ... ... ... has some ... gold ... 
  really ? 
  holy ... 
  something like : `` 10 eees '' `` ey ijust paidlike teneees '' `` whuat i thought like twenieees '', 
  ok , why did she do this ? 
  unless the guessed melody was from the [ god-king himself ] ( https://youtu.be/bfaquk5teke?t=40s ) ... than i fully understand . 
   article 80 : ( ... ) the president and vice president shall hold office during the term of four years and shall be elected by the voters in the member states by direct universal suffrage in a free and secret ballot . 
  every member state is apportioned a number of electoral votes according to its population . 
  ** representation of citizens shall be degressively proportional . 
  the president may not be elected to his office for more than two terms a lot of the constitution-articles really sound great !, 
  but i am not a big fan of the u.s. voting system ( no one is , except the orange guy ) . 
  i fear that a lot of people wo n't check the sources . 
  look at facebook , how many people are commenting on news-articles , without reading the actual article !, 
  it 's literaly one click away !, 
  crazy that siebenb\u00fcrgen / ardeal is so different , with a lot of green and blue . 
  does this come from different demographics or the economic situation ? 
  i know alot of people with blackredgold german flags on their balcony , that are totally sane and modest . 
  i would hope that our elected ** legislatures ** would have an answer for that , after they made the suggestion ... which is basically ... kind of their job . 
  because of that the csu party wants transit-zones on the borders , for prechecking identity and chances for asylum . 
  problem is ... the coalition spd party is against it . 
  if it was for me , i would place fat [ spd-siggy ] ( http://bilder.t-online.de/b/71/98/54/24/id_71985424/610/tid_da/spd-parteichef-sigmar-gabriel-hat-zoff-in-seiner-partei.jpg ) on the border ... quite like a human wall, 
  [ portugal ] ( http://www.threedeepmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/content-marketing-zoolander.png ), 
  my parents staid in a small hotel in greece , where part of the lobby-building had an incomplete wall . 
  my father asked the owner if they were renovating at the moment . 
  the man just laughed : `` ha ... noo no . . never finished ... so never taxes . '', 
  do n't know if thats true ... but ... it 's kinda smart . . and a little bit immoral, 
  the user i was responding to generalized : country , police and politicians . 
  i used that generalisation with an underlining sarcasm . 
  absolutely ... too much federalism and to few communication in crime investigation for example . 
  but you also have to consider the sheer number of people with multiple identities , lost papers , false age ... coming in in 2 years, 
  the city has gotten better , like [ phoenixsee ] ( http://www.arztzentrum-phoenixsee.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/slider-home-01.jpg ) or the renovated [ gr\u00fcnderzeit-houses in the north ] ( http://www.ruhrbarone.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nordstadth%c3%a4user_q_dsc07340.jpg ) , which have the [ most potential ] ( http://www.bento.de/upload/images/imager/upload/images/927774/nordstadt-08_de8b5ad080e4fb452f6b312cf546b418.jpg ) but i remember when i visited dortmund in 2000 ... ohboy, 
  plus it would not be safe to say , that he would give any valid information . 
  or that he would open his mouth anyway . 
  well most of the time it is considered [ positive ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=excitement&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjk0pio6odrahwgtxqkhy0xa_sq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662 ), 
  you get excitement from people being shot ? 
   earlier this year , a piece in the pro-government yeni akit said the two writers were `` not human '' . 
  they must have been confused by reading pamuks `` my name is red '' . 
   chapter one : i am a corpse thats what you get !!, 
   chapter two : i am a dog wait what ? 
  pastor : what do you want ? 
  wan na save christianity from middle eastern people !,
