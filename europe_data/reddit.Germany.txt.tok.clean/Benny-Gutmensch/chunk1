it is a saying , not a quote of an related article . 
  shaming is very effective , we all saw it during our own school time . 
  you ca n't even conter it , because `` wer sich verteidigt klagt sich an '' ( `` he who excuses , accuses himself '' ) . 
  the defense in this case would be , that germany and south africa made part of their own long time citizens 2nd class , not some newly arrived immigrants . 
  but as i said , does n't matter , it works . 
  in a parallel universe putin is a world class poker player . 
  my theory : isis did it to frame the kurds . 
  it makes sense . 
  it forces erdogan to go down on the kurds , one of isis worst enemies , harder than ever before . 
  there is even the benefit of him pissing off putin even more along this way . 
  edit : spelling, 
  the most important points * eu product regulations are primarily made to kill competition for the established big companies * national politicians use the eu as an excuse for anything are very valid . 
  especially the first point stifles innovation so badly , that the plusses , foremost the euro ( sue me :p ) , are outdone by the downsides . 
  all this of cause only considering the economic side , not war preventing long term political motivation . 
  i personally want the uk leave the eu so that we see i.e. 
  european entrpreneurs open business in the uk to avoid regulations that 'd kill them before getting started . 
  that could in turn be used to collect votes by eu politicians who promise to deregulate . 
  that 's right , the brexit might have an massive positive effect on the eu :d, 
  since being part of nato means to be not military neutral , this means : no you wo n't !, 
  as the death toll rises and details come in * inside the government district * military personal targetted * high death toll it becomes clear that this is huge . 
  it forces erdogan 's hand to do . . anything , really . 
  for those who wonder : you are still free to go where you want , but you have to endure passport checks at the borders . 
  he wants to be smug by leaving that info out as an exercise for the reader . 
  so much this . 
  [ harald kujat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harald_kujat ) , a former german chief of staff , said at a politcal talkshow that without russia 's engagement the peace talks would n't even be possible . 
  of cause he was ridiculed for that . 
  germany leading an military ** combat ** effort is close to unthinkable , right now . 
  the zeitgeist is that everything militaristic is inherently evil . 
  i dare say we rather watch millions of people die , watch tens of millions living in pooverty , just so we do n't have the blood of thousand on our hand . 
  ironically we do n't mind selling others our weapons to stain their hands in blood . 
  germany needs to grow up , i know , i think most people kind of know . 
  but it will take major events to change the current attitude . 
  i think these `` gender '' people are all about making it cool to * be racist * be oppressive * be hateful * make generalisations towards white men . 
  it makes totally sense , if you think about it . 
  there are is this hate in you that wants to get out , but it 's not cool anymore to hate on minorities . 
  genius . 
  this is obviously nuts . 
  by itself it does n't concern me , because there 's always nutjobs , all of you know them . 
  what is concerning is that these nutjobs get accepted into real jobs for doing their hate preaching by somebody . 
  how do you find out about these crimes if they do n't have papers on then and/or their home country does n't cooperate in trying to find out ? 
  once you 've set foot on german soil you can claim to be entitled to asylum , does n't matter if you 're making it up or not . 
  then you have legal rights to have your case vetted . 
  they ca n't just deport you the next day . 
  i do n't say that 's good or bad , just stating how it is , for now . 
  enough for russia to not snuff them out before a counter attack is possible ? 
  ca n't deny these numbers . 
  my gut feeling says the number would change if russia were to attack eastern nato partners . 
  but then i do n't understand my fellow citizens when it comes to the refugee crisis , letting hundreds of thousands of unregistered people cross our borders . 
  maybe you are right and i live in denial . 
  i do n't know . 
  confusing times . 
  if push comes to shove i 'd immigrate to a some place that is willing to fight . 
  would n't be easy though , i love gemany ; _ ;, 
  maybe , but that piece of germany would have the rest of germany on one side and poland on the other . 
  i would n't want to be in their shoes . 
  if that happens the nato falls apart . 
  we officially lose the us nuclear protection . 
  that changes everything . 
  france and germany would ** race ** together towards own modern nuclear weapons . 
  i 'm not ready to think about this , yet . 
  germany is n't ready to abondon hope on a peaceful russia . 
  not today , not in the next few years , but in 20 or 30 years . 
  i know that germany is part of nato , which is expanding towards russia . 
  but i still think that it 's merkel goal to buy time to give russia a chance to settle down . 
  totally possible that putin is aware of this and plays germany , just holding back enough to not change that policy of ours . 
  i also believe merkel is n't naive enough to not anticipate that . 
  that does n't change policy though , since there is the hope putin 's power crumbles eventually . 
  this policy is only possible because of the overwhelmingly powerful us military , we also know that . 
  the german policy could change if 1 . 
  the us military falls behind 2 . 
  something major happens edit : it 's, 
  i 'm 100 % sure that the germans would revolt if our government decided to join russia . 
  turkish men stealing russian women , so this is the real reason . 
  russia is a european nation that has expanded heavily eastwards . 
  yes , it is . 
  it sure looks civilian . 
  on the other hand it 's not too far fetched to assume there 've been forces down there , using the civilian area as cover . 
  then i hear putin wants to force the last residents of this city to add themself to the refugee stream to help collapse the eu . 
  that does sound drastic , but not more than forces hiding inside civilian areas . 
  i 'm at a total loss whom to believe nowadays . 
  as others have said , there is the csu , but thats an bavaria only party . 
  in essence you 're 100 % right . 
  `` for the economy as a whole '' beware . 
  this statistic does _ not _ mean what most people think it says : same jobs , different pay . 
  every saarl\u00e4nder i 've met would put france at # 1 . 
  germany in general is a lot more heterogeneous than outsiders think . 
  you can tell that the germans used to be just the clusterfuck that did n't belong to any big ethnic . 
  nuclear is unlikely , because it 's massively expensive . 
  thank you very much for the effort . 
  i see your point and agree now . 
  interesting . 
  so even the `` elite '' in sweden does n't want the euro . 
  ok , thank you . 
  it 's not just about the money . 
  if we had a referendum in germany back then , i can tell you , we would n't have it either . 
  it was very unpopular . 
  for that reason , and more importantly my gut feeling , i hereby claim : sweden very much is part of the core of the eu . 
  this group covers a very big spectrum of the european mentality , even while excluding east europe and the uk . 
  for a long time people called for a `` core eu '' that can get things done . 
  the great fear was having an polarising effect on europe , making new conflicts inevitable .
