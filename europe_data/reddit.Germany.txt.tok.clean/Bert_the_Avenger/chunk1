i was talking about two seperate things . 
  one is the burning of refugee housing and the other is the video of a mob scaring refugee families with children to tears . 
  both are examples of a behaviour that leads people to assume that you are indeed a nazi . 
  you can never be sure if the penguins behave the same way everywhere . 
  they might be plotting * something * and we have to know . 
  yes , still a public broadcaster . 
  normal zdf is still kind of meh . 
   opposing migration makes you literally a nazi no . 
  if you scroll down you can find a world map below the list . 
  the uk is shown in white as is brazil , most of central and western africa and south-east asia . 
  so one can only assume that there is simply no sufficient data for the uk to appear in said list . 
  some quick google-fu brought up some numbers . 
  according to [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_statistics#australia ) the uk has a 24.1 / 100,000 but the sources are weak . 
  according to [ this site ] ( http://rapecrisis.org.uk/statistics.php ) every year 97,000 people are raped in england and wales ( no data for scotland and northern ireland ) which would translate to approximately 150/100 ,000 . 
  this number looked extremely high to me so a look at their [ sources ] ( http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/214970/sexual-offending-overview-jan-2013.pdf ) showed that these are numbers based on surveys and do not represent the number of cases reported to the police which are shown in the list . 
  but the same source also lists the number of cases reported to the police . 
  there are roughly 16,000 cases of rape which translates to about 25/100 ,000 . 
  so that wikipedia number looks spot on . 
  yep . 
  football , bicycles and m\u00fcllabfuhr . 
  and how would you do that ? 
  after all we stole all your bicycles . 
  which is which ? 
  why would anybody care about some dead irish guys anways ? 
   peasant shooting is a common pursuit for the rich i took that silly little h out of there . 
  must have slipped in somehow . 
  we tried that once , did n't work out . 
  [ with good ol' werner , even penguins are depressing . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-krircts4rs&amp;t=53s ), 
  do n't mind us , we 're just passing through . 
  yeah , fuck those stupid long horses !, 
  sure , we 're shouting angrily at each other all the time while obeying the almighty ampelm\u00e4nnchen . 
  yet when we speak english we all soung like [ werner herzog ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf5xbtal3yi&amp;t=34s ) . 
  move along , there 's nothing to see here . 
  in my experience we 're only the nazis for north americans . 
  for south americans it 's the mannschaft and sometimes a `` your grandfather was a nazi ! '', 
  which can easily be muted by `` yours too , enrico jos\u00e9 santiago de compostella della costa blanca ** m\u00fcller ** ! '' . 
  for most europeans it 's `` your weird merkel woman '' and for the rest of the world we 're just making cars . 
  that was the really funny part to me . 
  the joke itself was meh . 
  not bad but not particularly good either . 
  i laughed so hard , i started crying !, 
  also works in german . 
  have you seen portugal ? 
  now that 's a foto realistic map . 
  the batman part ? 
  well , luxembourg does mean ` actual size ' translated into english . 
  meh , i feel like that 's pretty basic knowledge . 
  it is yellow but we call it gold . 
  a drunk football supporter from frankfurt to be precise . 
   & nbsp ; ^ ^ ^ anti-headache : ^ ^ ^ why ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ think ^ ^ ^ russians ^ ^ ^ drink ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ vodka ? 
  so it 's a bit like the german ` da ' . 
  i lived in that area for a while , but on the german side . 
  there really was no reason at all to go to the german ikea . 
  the one in heerlen was cheaper * and * closer . 
  it 's a kind of running gag within the world of tanks community that if you sacrifice enough dissidents the ghost of stalin will rise from hell to personally guide the shell from your horribly inaccurate gun to the target . 
  while the target is moving . 
  while you are moving . 
  and while your gun is damaged . 
  did n't work out very well , though . 
   [ hitler ] had r\u00f6hm murdered and used r\u00f6hm 's homosexuality as a justification to suppress outrage within the ranks of the sa . 
  after solidifying his power , hitler would include gay men among those sent to concentration camps during the holocaust . 
  [ we 're gay * and * fascist ? 
  well , i do n't have any children but if i did i would n't take them to finland either . 
  you do n't look after them for short moment and all of a sudden they are either drunk or in a death metal band . 
  or both . 
  or they do [ something like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhreqkrvone ) , whatever that is . 
  finland ? 
  hell no . 
  a fabulous crime but still a crime . 
  that gives this comic a whole new meaning . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  so what , piglet is working at glorious wargaming eu headquarters in paris . 
  and piglet need poster of stalin so dead hand of stalin can guide shell to hit fascist box tank !, 
  it 's a fetish thing , i suppose . 
  i 'm not gon na judge peoples ' fetishes but [ oh boy ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_current_sovereign_monarchs ), 
    eagles !, 
  i really liked the night/day / ... watch books and hardcore henry was fun . 
  where do i get my paycheck ? 
  ok guys , you had your fun . 
  now it 's back to the fields , that asparagus wo n't harvest itself . 
  it 's a turkish donkey . 
  it 's not like they have the money to send it to donkey college or something . 
  which one ? 
  i say it 's technically a draw . 
  good job malta !, 
  to be fair , a united ireland ruled by the french would be kind of awkward . 
  so we can have our wall back ? 
   and they forgot all the platinum medals ~ ~ they ~ ~ earnt ~ ~ due to ~ ~ by glorious leader ~ ~ s inpsirational speeches . ~ ~ you go to reeducation camp nao !, 
  praise be the dear leader , who is a perfect incarnation of the appearance that a leader should have !, 
  as long as something is purely cosmetic why do anything a s long as the child does n't care ? 
  i simply do n't support any surgical operation that is medically not necessary just because the parents think that it might be a great idea . 
   the non-democratic argument is just far more stupid . 
  exactly that . 
  i can kind of understand the anti-semitic argument , i mean it 's a silly argument , but i understand where he 's coming from . 
  but calling it undemocratic with a 90 % consesus is just rididulously stupid . 
  i do n't think babies care about a big nose so there are no psychological reasons . 
  john cena !, 
  yeah , but she 's a woman . 
  that 's not * real * journalism .
