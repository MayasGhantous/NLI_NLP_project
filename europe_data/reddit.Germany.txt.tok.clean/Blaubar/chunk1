ah ok , so what 's the connection between karsk and tr\u00f8ndelag ? 
  just a stereotype or is there a deeper connection ? 
  margrave of brandenburg was a * kurf\u00fcrst * since the 13th century , so long before the reformation . 
   sounds like a theme park for karsk enthusiasts i know what karsk is but , for non-norwegians , what is the connection between karsk and h\u00e5logaland ? 
  there are at least a lot in berlin . 
  maybe frankfurt or munich are n't so popular with the easyjet crowd . 
   partly because in germany , we did n't see the huge inequality issues in britain , we always just saw the upper class , intelligent , well manored , creative , wonderfolk . 
  you do n't live in a bigger city frequented by british stag dos , do you ? 
  ahh , thanks for the explanation !, 
   that means a judge can go against the specific wording of a law , if the intended purpose is different compared to the wording . 
  do you mind giving an example ? 
  i ca n't quite get my head around it . 
  that 's true although news could travel surprisingly fast in this age . 
  just to nitpick but us presidential candidates did n't personally campaign until the 20th century . 
  i know this one as : `` swimming through the odra/oder , running to berlin , coming back by car . '', 
  nobody uses that name though . 
  lafontaine was spd back then . 
  it starts at 4am . 
  most parties last longer normally , but it 's still alright . 
  yeah , good friday is considered a ` silent holiday ' because something sad is commemorated . 
  luckily not in berlin, 
  in berlin the * tanzverbot * goes only until 9pm . 
  [ in berlin ] ( http://www.the-berg.de/ ), 
  and m\u00f8ns klint and bornholm , you have lots of sea , that 's definitely a plus, 
  are you from szczecin by any chance ? 
   also new people who do n't make fun of lycra bicycle wear would be nice . 
  i do n't think you will find that anywhere, 
  * s\u00e4nk ju for tr\u00e4welling wiss deutsche bahn, 
  yeah , there is also * schnurrhaare * . 
  * brom * fiets - moped my favourite dutch word, 
  [ poster of the ( irrelevant ) german communist party ] ( http://www.dkp-berlin.info/images/stories/2014/wahlplakate/euwahl01ukraine.png ), 
  take some time , wikipedia , a cup of coffee and read !, 
  * snabel * means trunk in danish ?? 
  in proper germanic languages that 's the word for beak . 
  rollm\u00f6pse for everyone !, 
  most definitely, 
  the bnd is the * bundesnachrichtendienst * , germany 's foreign intelligence agency . 
  it is known they cooperate with the nsa , gchq and the swedish intelligence , but they were n't ( yet ) caught spying on all german citizens . 
  toskana-linke !, 
  i neither agree nor disagree with your point , but you 're horribly wrong about the way the nazis went to power . 
  were n't there some russian ( or japanese ) scientists who wanted to clone a mammoth ? 
  there are also some neanderthaler genes in modern europeans , so you even could be a neanderthaler . 
  your point ? 
   home of biggest mosque in europe only if you consider the caucasus as the border of europe . 
  in germany most consider the manych depression as the border . 
  europe is n't a really continent anyways . 
  true . 
  democracy should n't be a tyranny of the majority though . 
  i know . 
  / u/bezbojnicul the voice of reason, 
  j\u00e4germeister is not so bad , a bit sweet , but not so bad . 
  fascist reddit does n't support the umlaut . 
  til . 
  there 's always : * bier in ma\u00dfen genie\u00dfen . 
  there 's also * der innere schweinehund ( the inner pig-dog ) * . 
  `` geschoss '' is written and pronounced the same as `` geschoss '' . 
  go and piss off to switzerland or luxembourg , traitor !, 
   i 'm living the dream in cluj that was obvious . 
  i think he can choose . 
  ... sure you do n't want a new ceausescu ? 
  you seem to be the kind of person who would be a fan of putin if he were romanian . 
  good letter !, 
  i know that he is the holiest person in turkey , but atat\u00fcrk was n't exactly a perfect democrat too . 
  ` zwei birren ' is n't right at all ... 
  well , nobody wants to store nuclear waste under their backyard and as you may know germany is far more densely populated than finland or sweden . 
  muntenia + oltenia together are termed wallachia . 
  muntenia is greater wallachia , oltenia lesser wallachia . 
  maybe it 's because there are n't so many starbucks in berlin , but here no self-respecting hipster would o there . 
  there would go to some independent/alternative caf\u00e9 where they sit with their laptops , drink latte macchiato and discuss their newest projects . 
  starbucks is a place for teenage girls ( and boys ) to feel cosmopolitan and american ( like in the movies !!, 
  i never touched europa universalis ^ really !, 
  and i still know my geography , ha !, 
   bornholm : reserve swedes and germans . 
  is starbucks associated with hipsters in the netherlands ? 
  you really do n't differentiate enough . 
  as a berliner i do n't want to get grouped together with those filthy saxons . 
  ... and i guess some people would claim franconia as the land of beer and sausage, 
  bornholm is gorgeous , m\u00f8ns klint is very beautiful too . 
  fran\u021b-iosef m\u00e2ller fon raihen\u0219tain, 
   pigeons are dieing en mass because of a parasite . 
  good . 
  i do n't think so , religious elements where involved in the the revolution of 1989 in the gdr . 
  still east germany today is n't very religious . 
  also this : * it was not until the mid-19th century that ethnic estonians replaced the local baltic germans as the majority among the residents of tallinn . 
  * ( from wikipedia ), 
  yep , i have a friend whose ancestors ( volga germans ) were deported to kazakhstan under stalin . 
  i 'm glad you survived . 
  fact : the label ` made in germany ' was introduced by the british in the 19th century to discourage the people to buy cheap , `` low quality '' german products . 
  if the uk is separated in its constituent countries , i also want germany to be split into its federal states ( worst country : bavaria ) !, 
  i also use british english , not because i like britain but i hate the us more !, 
  in many languages ( german for example ) nationality means citizenship, 
  berliners are kings in complaining , but it never bothers them so much , that they do something against it . 
  why is this in german ? 
  the hate , is more a `` hate '' and i like to tease my friends from the south with talking shit about bavaria . 
  i do n't like that the people from the outside seem to think germany = bavaria + berlin and often totally forget about the rest of germany . 
  i also do n't like that `` german festivals '' ( esp but not only in the us ) tend to be `` bavarian festivals '' instead . 
  ... but maybe i 'm just ein griesgr\u00e4miger sauprei\u00df , 
  i do n't think it 's anything particular about reddit , it 's just that foreigners tend to reduce germany just to bayern ( lederhosen , oktoberfest ... ) . 
  also csu . 
  oktoberfest and bavaria are the worst things about germany !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
