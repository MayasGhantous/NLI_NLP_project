  m\u00fcsli is fucking delicious , i think it 's the most common cereal in germany,

  well my cousins father is from mecklenburg , his mother is belarusian and he was born in munich , so it 's definitely more widespread now ,

  hermann/hermine , august/augustine , wilhelm/wilhelmine , ernst/ernestine etc, 
  yeah , but 'til the 20s it was only used in northern germany , in the 20s it became more ` mainstream ' and widespread in the population, 
  should 've added , that * hauke * is a masculine name , while * elke * is a feminine name, 
  some additional infos : according to wikipedia the name was introduced in the 1920s in germany , as in the top20 for newborns since the 1970s, 
  some originally frisian names are actually kinda common in germany ( * hauke , elke * ), 
  i live in germany , and i actually know two people named mats, 
  * sonja * and * sandra * are really popular in germany too , * esther * ( a biblical name ) to a lesser extent, 
  i have the feeling , that finland has a lot of purely finnish names ( like mika , kimi , teemu ; maybe shared with estonian ) , as your language is n't indo-european and there does n't seem much influence from surrounding languages ( like in hungarian ), 
  gunnar , henning and bj\u00f6rn are kinda popular in germany , too, 
  in germany the name * jan * is also very common ( my cousin is named so ) , maybe jan was introduced in czechia by german people from northern germany ?

  while you 're right , that ostalgie is especially common among lower class people , i would n't say the core of the were involved with the regime . 
  the main reasons for ostalgie are the typical `` everything-was-better-in-the-past '' and the fact , that many people ( read people born in the 1950s or earlier ) lost their jobs after the reunification , because state-owned companies were privatized , many degrees were n't recognized in the bundesrepublik and many people had difficulties to deal with the way application processes worked after reunification .

  [ fantastic mr. fox ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fantastic_mr._fox_ ( film ) ) , really nice film , based on a roald dahl novel . 
  you can say that , but it is proven that , here in the country in east germany , many men tend to stay and work in their parents business , while most girls move to the big cities like berlin or to west germany, 
  i love norwegian girls , because ... ... they have beautiful pussies . 
  as / u/clit _ commander said , many women immigrate to more prosperous areas , while men are usually less mobile and stay at home .
