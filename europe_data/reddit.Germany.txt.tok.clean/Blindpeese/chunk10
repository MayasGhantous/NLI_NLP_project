  the way the moj decided to bypass everybody without notifying the public about some seriously drastic changes is crazy . 
  anyway , here 's the translation : ** hate-speech law : already extended before it enters into force ** the network enforcement act is no longer directed against hate speech and fake news , but also against pornographic content and many other offenses . 
  in addition , the new draft now contains the idea to give private persons the possibility to inquire the identity on other private individuals , which could lead to the end of anonymity on the internet . 
  the ministry of justice has submitted a new draft of the hate-speech law to the eu commission before the expiry of the deadline for the hearing of private interest groups . 
  the new draft now contains much more criminal offenses , as well as the fact that private persons now are supposed to have access to information about the identity of other private persons . 
  thus , the law is already extended before it has become law at all . 
  only the upload filters for the prevention of the upload of a once reported file are now removed . 
  however , the design also contains the possibility to establish content filters to delete already existing content . 
  ** significant restrictions on freedom of expression and communication ** we have already criticized the older draft as problematic for the freedom of expression and , among other things , the spongy definition of social networks . 
  other voices have also suggested that the establishment of a contact adress should be legally anchored and that the prosecution of authors of criminal hate speech should become more important . 
  the digitale gesellschaft ( name oft he organization ) criticizes the fact that the new draft makes social networks actually a content police of the internet and that it prepares the privatized enforcement of laws . 
  with the expansion of the criminal catalog and the inclusion of a the possibility to request information for private individuals , these risks would be further intensified . 
  the possibility to make inquiries about the names of private persons through other private persons in the new draft , involves the risk of enforcing the use of real names on the internet through a legal back door . 
  for the inquiry you need always two legal bases ( double door model ) - one for the right to information and one for the authority to grant access to the information . \u00a7 14 telemediengesetz ( tmg ) regulates the access , not the right to information . 
  the federal court is deducing the right to information in case of personal rights violations from the principle of good faith , which is n't part of \u00a7 14 tmg . 
  if , therefore , the new draft is introduced as law in \u00a7 14 tmg , the path for information inquiries is free for everybody . 
  if private persons can now under the pretext of violation of absolute personal rights and without the involvement of judges , make inquiries about the identity of users on the internet , the intimidation effect will lead to a considerable restriction of freedom of expression and communication and threatens whistleblowers . 
  in addition , such a power of information provides abuse potential for other forms of hate criminality . 
  users could , for example , require access to information about addresses of other persons in `` real life '' . 
  the problem is that no court or prosecutor 's office checks whether such an infringement on personal rights has been submitted . 
  the checking must be done by the online service itself , just as in the case of deleting comments . 
  ** suddenly also against pornography ** also new in the draft is the procedure against the spread of pornography . 
  in the old draft , it was still said , that pornography crimes were `` already effectively pursued '' . 
  the law now seeks to promote the extinction of ordinary nipples & co. by extending it by \u00a7 184 d . this is not just about spreading child pornography , which is already effectively prevented and tracked by all major networks . 
  the effects on group chats , for example whatsapp , which might also be affected by the law depending on the size , should be interesting . 
  here , part-public communication on legal content such as pornography would suddenly become the focus of deletions . 
  a number of other criminal offenses have now been added to the draft , which maas recently presented at the press conference : - \u00a7 89a preparation of a serious state-endangering crime - \u00a7 90b anti-constitutional denigration of constitutional bodies - \u00a7 91 instructions for the commission of a serious state-threatening act of violence + \u00a7 100a national treason + \u00a7 129a formation of terrorist groups + \u00a7 129b criminal and terrorist associations abroad + \u00a7 131 violence representation + \u00a7 184b dissemination , acquisition and possession of child pornography + \u00a7 184d access to pornographic content by radio or telemedia ; retrieval of child and adolescent pornography by means of telemedia ** who is affected by the law is not exactly clear ** the bill also contains the already-criticized definition of social networks , which in case of doubt could also include e-mail platforms and other services . 
  in the new draft , the user limit of two million now means that it is not `` registered users '' , but only users . 
  in this case it is unclear whether there are not much more platforms which would fall under the new regulation , if in addition ordinary users , who simply visit a site are taken as basis for definition . 
  the draft leaves room for interpretation , even if a spokesman for the ministry of justice spoke of `` registered users '' only , when asked by netzpolitik.org . 
  by means of such vague definitions , the law , in addition to the harmful implications for freedom of expression , could create great legal uncertainty among companies . 
  it is also unusual in the legislative process that the opinions of private organizations can not be incorporated into the law as usual , because the moj hastily notified the draft to the eu commission without waiting for the passing of the deadline . 
  eu member states must notify the commission in case of new legislation on products and services concerning information companies before passing the bills . 
  this is intended to ensure that laws are compatible with the european internal market and eu law . 
  this hasty process is criticised by digitale gesellschaft : `` this approach creates the impression that any objections on the part of private organizations will be ignored in the house of justice minister maas and the bill in the now notified form is already a decided thing . '', 
  mods must be busy with the article 50 posts . 
  this kind of question actually belongs to / r/askeurope . 
  just fyi . 
  here 's an answer to your question : http://www.giorgiocomai.eu/2015/09/25/journals-post-soviet-and-eastern-european-affairs/ the list should be a good start . 
  his twitter channel is a good source , too . 
  i am getting tired of this shit . 
  i could ask you the same retarded questions , too . 
  where is your problem with saying they did n't annex it ? 
  i made my points ... ( you know , a dozen times ) . 
  i described ( ... about a dozen times , according to you ) why i think that the notion of a polish annexation is `` stretching it '' . 
  i have no interest in reiterating my points ( for the 13th time now , i guess ?! ) . 
  thus me implying that i am annoyed by your circle-jerking . 
  i argued with a few people today and i managed to reach some kind of understanding with most of them . 
  i even agreed with the op i answered to on certain points and he seems to be satisfied with the result so far . 
  and noooooooooooooooooooooooooow you come along with some retarded left-right allusions and want me to discuss it all over again with you . 
  it is fuckin tiresome . 
  leave me alone . 
  go away . 
  fuck off and downvote me , i seriously could n't care less by now . 
  i had a few good debates here , i am ok with that , i do n't have any motivation to argue with you . 
  like really ... zero , nada , absolutely no motivation . 
  words can not describe any more clearly how much i do n't want to debate with you . 
   dude , approximately a dozen people replied to you and all you do is winding yourself around . 
  i am pretty consistent in my line of argument . 
  how am i winding myself around ? 
   you keep saying why the polish did it ( because they were forced by stalin ) reading comprehension is not your strong suit , right ? 
  i said it about a dozen times now ( you made sure to point it out ) , the polish did n't do shit . 
  people are overestimating the power of the polish government after wwii by quite a margin . 
  it 's getting tedious by now . 
  you hop in hours after the argument and start a retarded circle-jerk with me , pointing out things in my line of argument which do n't exist . 
  you are irritating as fuck . 
   because you assume that saying the polish annexed it makes you a right wing extremist , which is absolute rubbish . 
  i 'm facepalming myself real hard right now ? 
  how the friggin actual fuckin fuck did you get to this retarded , absolutely stupid , not even close to reality , conclusion ? 
  i seriously did n't think for a moment about any kind of `` left-right '' implications regarding this issue . 
  i merely pointed out in the beginning that the term `` polish annexation '' is pushing it really hard , because it oversimplifies a very complex matter . 
  i felt inclined to show an additional side of the issue . 
  i do n't care at all , like really absofuckinluuuuuteeeeeeeeeely about any right-wing bullshit regarding this issue . 
  what.the.hell.is.wrong.with.you ? 
   saying they annexed it does n't convey any value or reason why they did it . 
  yeah right . 
  especially nowadays with all that annexation bullshit around crimea , the term annexation conveys a looooooooooot of implied meaning . 
  you thinking , that it does not is your * opinion * . 
  considering that other people in this thread also have an other perception of the term * annexation * and the bullshit surrounding such events , shows that i 'm not completely alone . 
   did it occur to you that annexing a territory does n't mean you have to do it out of free will ? 
  nope , because that notion is quite dumb to be honest . 
  `` oh sorry , i actually do n't want to annex this territory , but that other guy is forcing me and i am too weak to do anything against it . 
  no hard feelings bro , but the other guy says that all your bases belong to us now , ok ? '', 
  yeah ... that qualifies as mental gymnastics , dude . 
  sorry , i obviously missed your * argument * . 
  please enlighten me , where you managed to hide it . 
  all i see is a quote by bismarck . 
  a real german hero - . - and now you 're complaining because i do n't reply with an argument to a quote . 
  am i supposed to read your thoughts ? 
  there is no obligation for me to retort in a more meaningful manner , than your * comment * . 
  try making a point , without * implying * shit and maybe i 'll be able to respond to your concerns regarding the topic . 
  also , thanks for the downvote ... real classy . 
  the poles did n't take anything . 
  even after wwii they would n't have had the power to simply take away german territory . 
  poland , nah let 's rephrase it ... the country that was just as germany equally fabricated out of thin air by stalin and the allies and at that point did n't have anything close to a government that would be able to advocate for annexation of german territories backed by real power , did n't do shit . 
  the fate of germany was not decided by `` poland '' . 
  that notion is ridiculous . 
  like i said , k\u00f6nigsberg , that 's clear cut annexation . 
  the redrawing of borders was some stupid shit made up on the go in the tradition of redrawing borders , as witnessed in the middle east for example . 
  during those times the idea to simply decide for defeated countries where their borders should lie in the future , was obviously accepted bhaviour .
