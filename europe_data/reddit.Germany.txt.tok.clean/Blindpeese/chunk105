  let me guess ... exception ...  you last one is trump criticizing obama , the current criticizing the past , which is the opposite . 
  yes i know . 
  that 's why i wrote `` president-elect '' . 
  i was only curious , whether your nice `` fairy-tale-agreement '' only is obligatory in one direction . 
  i guess so . 
  trump undermining the current president is ok , when he 's not an ex-president ... got it . 
   how about i do you one better . 
  i 'll take a quote from one of the articles you linked to : yes i know , contrary to your assumption , i know what i link to . 
  i want you to link to some kind of article/document saying , that there actually is a gentlemen 's agreement and obama was the first one to actually really break it . 
  so please , try it : show us all , that obama is the first one and that nobody else did it before . 
   we already see the resulting cultural clashes . 
  guess you 're a huntington fanboi ... what a surprise . 
   cultural relativism . 
  hey look ... you found your `` internet arguments 101 '' handbook . 
  why would i ? 
  i like living in a democratic country with rule of law and a nice health-care system . 
  just like my muslim neigbour . 
  whose wife does n't wear a scarf , veil , burka , whatever ...  a real schism exists . 
  yep , that 's true . 
  it exists between people like you and people like me . 
  the schism goes down the middle of many western countries . 
  people like trump , lepen , etc only help widening these schisms . 
  our problems are not the muslims ( well , they are posing challenges , too , but anyways ) . 
  our real problem is , that we are divided to the core about some real fundamental issues . 
  on a national level . 
  the refugee crisis only managed to show us , that after the fall of the su , without a common ideological enemy , we now decided to turn on ourselves and fight each other on a national level . 
  it showed , that all the `` democracy is going to win '' was actually just show . 
  now that democracy does n't have to win anymore ( the end of history already happened , right ? ), 
  i guess it 's time to follow the demagogues again . 
   walls , as always , provide an answer to the problem . 
  as always ... sure ... the berlin wall , was such a good solution . 
  because :  some things need to be separated . 
  right ? 
   why did israel want to erect walls ? 
  failed policies ? 
  there was actually a `` wall '' between france and germany . 
  the maginot line . 
  our countries were seriously incompatible . 
  the germans used the term [ `` erbfeind '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french%e2%80%93german_enmity ) to describe the french . 
  we managed to overcome it finally . 
  and do n't tell me something about that cultural bullshit . 
  the germans made it a point to emphasize that their `` culture '' was deeply rooted compared to the superficial civilizations surrounding them . 
  germans back then were convinced that they were culturally superior . 
  we know where it led to . 
  they did n't see themselves as culturally compatible with the french . 
  they would have loughed at you , when you would have tried to insinuate , that a german is in any way comparable to a french . 
  all this cultural the end is nigh bullshit is getting old ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_decline_of_the_west ) . 
  times changed , perceptions changed . 
  good policies changed our attitudes and fostered cooperation and trust . 
  we managed to tear down the walls in our heads ... you could say . 
  ok ... i guess you 're too lazy to click on the links yourself , well then : a selection of links : http://video.foxnews.com/v/4335516328001/?#sp=show-clips http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jimmy-carter-obama-isis http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/jimmy-carter-barack-obama-isil-111692 http://www.businessinsider.com/george-w-bush-just-sharply-criticized-obama-for-the-first-time-2015-4?ir=t https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ken-walshs-washington/2015/04/27/george-w-bush-criticizes-obama-policies http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-usa-clinton-idusn1932464420070719 http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/us/politics/04clintons.html https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/30/donald-trump-russia-obama-sanctions but let 's make this mor fun : can you please provide a bunch of links backing your claim that `` it 's convention in the us that past presidents do n't undermine the current president . '' ?!, 
  a convention ? 
  a gentlemen 's agreement ? 
  is it obligatory ? 
  how does it work ? 
  did you actually make it up ? 
  yeah , they 're also the reason for rrrrrrreeeaaaaaly good relations between neighbouring countries . 
  more walls -  more friends !, 
  and come on , if the romans did it , why should n't we do it today aswell ? 
  nothing spells 2000 years of progress , like building new walls in 2017 ... 
   it 's convention in the us that past presidents do n't undermine the current president . 
  bush jr. did n't do it to obama , clinton did n't do it to bus oh please stop your bullshit : https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=jimmy+carter+criticizes+president+obama https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=bush+criticizes+obama https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=clinton+criticizes+bush https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=johnson+criticizes+nixon and besides : https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=trump+undermines+obama and let 's not forget his tweets as the president-elect : https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=trump+russia+sanctions+tweets, 
   some stuff is worth blocking out . 
  yeah , just wait till you 're on the receiving end ... 
  this will trigger the usual suspect on both sides of the atlantic . 
  i 'll check back tomorrow for the memes . 
  the mod of r/russia confirmed it guys !, 
  it 's true then !, 
   lel , the_donald is loosing their shit damn , i guess they did n't leave reddit . 
  fuckin snowflakes ... voat was obviously too extreme for them . 
  `` mooooooooom , they are mean to me here ! '', 
   am i the only one who thinks merkel looks great yep ... perv . 
   funny how obama is worshiped in germany i 'm sure you have good numbers backing up this claim ...  and making sure that the eu has the worst relationship possible with russia . 
  nah mate , putin can manage to do that all by himself ... remember ukraine ? 
  i remember ... 
  do n't cut yourself on that edge , brah . 
   everything is simple when you 're young , because to be young is to be simple . 
  sure ... 
  i 'll assume then , that you 're very young , due to the very simplistic views you adhere to . 
   history repeats itself , even within decades , the same thing/situation gets a different name but the older folks see it for what it is and know how to vote to affect the outcome . 
  i guess it 's a matter of perception again . 
  from a german pov i can tell you the following : my mom worked in a nursing home ( for old people , i think they 're called nursing homes , i 'm not sure actually ) . 
  a lot of the men `` living '' there , were old nazis . 
  i mean , literally , nazis . 
  they have n't given up on their views . 
  quite the contrary , the older they got , the more disturbing it all became . 
  old women on the other side , were often completely anti-fascists . 
  they had a different experience regarding the war . 
  if you would ask those people , all being old , etc , you could get vastly different responses . 
  you could get quite a lot of responses , describing how `` this kind of shit would n't have been possible under adolf '' . 
  what i actually want to say is : people experience history in different ways . 
  many old people here in germany still have fond memories of those fascist times . 
  they did n't become wiser . 
  if they had the chance , they would prefer repeating those mistakes , because `` not everything was bad '' ... `` you know , without the war , it actually could be really good '' ... etc. 
  their experience is vastly different and can get you results you would n't want to have . 
  being old and experienced does n't exempt them from doing the same mistakes again . 
  at least in germany . 
  the historical experience for brittish people is different again . 
  nevertheless , i would bet that old people are as qualified as young people to fuck everything up beyond recognition , based on their individual perception and experience ... 
  orban is a genius .
