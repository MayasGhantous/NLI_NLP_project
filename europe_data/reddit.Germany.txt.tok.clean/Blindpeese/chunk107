  why do you have the urge to make it about my person ? 
  is that all you have left as line of argumentation ? 
  no real points then ? 
  good job , very convincing . 
  all of them could left the country by political asylum if they want . 
  bsing , that 's your speciality . 
  i said those who could , left the country . 
  meaning those who actually could , because they could afford it , they could take their families , or did n't feel moraly obliged to stay in their country to keep on reporting . 
  those who remained in russia are people with some kind of feeling of responsibility for their country . 
  it will cost them their lives , or their freedom in the long run ...  define often . 
  every time they report on an event that can affect putin and his posse . 
   and also millions of blogs and youtube channels . 
  yeah , and they have so much [ reach ] ( https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/market%20and%20political%20factors%20and%20the%20russian%20media%20-%20katja%20lehtisaari.pdf ) , right ?!, 
  `` the russian media model relies heavily on the central role of tv , as it has done since the collapse of the soviet union . 
  tv is the main medium for most russians . 
  ninety-nine per cent watch tv at least monthly , while computers are used by 72 % and mobile devices , such as tablet computers , by 45 % . 
  the main tv channels are state-controlled directly or through companies closely connected to the state . 
  these channels include , for example , pervyi kanal ( first channel ) , rossiia 1 ( russia 1 ) , ntv and tnt ( vartanova , 2015 , p. 139 ) . 
  they still get the majority of their funding from advertising and sponsorship . 
  among the top-10 channels are also privately owned channels , including sts and ren-tv . 
  when it comes to news supply , newspapers also still have an important albeit diminishing role . 
  even though social media have gained more significance in people 's lives in russia ( fossato & lloyd , 2008 ; lonkila , 2012 ; toepfl , 2014 ; zassoursky , 2009 ) , news is still mainly produced by tv and newspaper companies ( cf.kleis nielsen , 2012 ) . '', 
   yeah so tame you can hear opposition journalists almost every day . 
  still pretty tame . 
  also define opposition journalist . 
  cool ... i like this retarded define game . 
  i did n't even know , that there are * opposition * journalists . 
  must be some russian phenomenon . 
  i guess you implicitly admit , that you also have government journalists then . 
  could you name them please ? 
   this is false . 
  as i said , there 's no problem in getting alternative view in russia . 
  what is false with it ? 
  i did n't imply , that there is a * problem * with getting an alternative view . 
  the problem is in * providing * that view . 
  it 's quite interesting that the editors of meduza decided to leave the country in order to be able to provide an alternative view . 
   yeah most of this list a journalists killed in chechnya or by some local thugs . 
  but of course they all were killed by bloody kremlin , right ? 
  you are dense , but it 's no surprise . 
  the connection between thugs , the russian government and oligarchs is nothing new . 
  you wo n't be convincing anybody by pretending that those journalists were killed by local thugs for some minor reason . 
  so , to sum it up : i provided you with arguments , although i actually was n't in the mood for it , because your line of defense is the retarded `` define '' game . 
  please spare me your next comment , all i expect to happen is , that you 're start nitpicking single words . 
  that 's all you got left . 
  and i have no interest in arguing with you or convincing you . 
  i just needed the space here to show anybody else reading this , how wrong you are . 
  thanks for giving me the opportunity and actually making it even easier for me by providing such easy pseudo-points , like you did in your comment . 
  i hope you do n't get paid for this . 
  you surely are bad at this shit . 
  also , some further reading for shits and gigglez : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840134, 
   i 'd think most pro-nazi countries would be . 
  wow , and you actually tried to become a mod for r/europe . 
  you sure are mod material , but actually for r/russia . 
  none . 
  i 'm a scientist and your methods are clearly lacking . 
  you posited that your `` thesis '' has been `` sufficiently '' proven . 
  i stated , that i do n't think so . 
  so far all your points have been countered . 
  therefore your `` proof '' is not `` sufficient '' . 
  it 's really simple . 
  i actually know russian and tbh there are n't many left . 
  those who could left the country and the few remaining get threatened quite often . 
  the only outlets with some kind of reach ( actually very limited reach ) are \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0413\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430 and \u0414\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c . 
  lenta is a joke by now and \u042d\u0301\u0445\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b\u0301 is pretty tame . 
  you 're left with meduza and for people who speak german dekoder.org so that 's it , and here 's a list with killed journalists in russia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia, 
   no , you do n't understand . 
  ukraine is playing dirty while pretending they are modern pro-western progressive democracy . 
  so the guy you answered to is right : ** both ** sides are playing dirty . 
  you might aswell replace ukraine in your sentence with russia and it still would be correct . 
   every step ukraine takes it gets closer and closer to 1930s ussr . 
  you mean 2017 russia ? 
  hey , at least they did n't throw green stuff in her face ... or shot her ... 
   some russian opposition journalists . 
  shit , you still have them ? 
  i guess they wo n't be alive for long ... 
   my thesis `` the ribbon has been a major symbol of victory day prior to 2005 '' has been sufficiently proven . 
  no it has n't . 
   i do n't have to provide any additional arguments . 
  sure you have , if you want to actually * convince * anybody here , besides yourself ... 
  your points so far have been actually very weak ... 
   some countries you mean `` some people '' ... 
   stopping the wearing of these garments will make things more universal is all i am suggesting . 
  good job , this sentence has absolutely no content whatsoever . 
  you are * suggesting * that banning * these garments * will make * things more universal * ... ok then . 
  and all that without porn !, 
  that sure will be a hard life ... or not , haha ... ok , i 'll show myself out now ... 
   i 'm all for economic integration , with everybody , anything that stops short of a political union . 
  hey , you edited your comment . 
  uncool man . 
  visa free travel , sure , why not . 
  economic integration ? 
  without a political union ? 
  forget it . 
  i mean , if you 're talking about full integration , anything more , than a fta . 
  we already have this shit and we can see how it works . 
  everybody is fine with selling shit and making money , but nobody is fine with cooperating politically on a supranational level . 
  this has to change . 
  you can have a trade agreement . 
  that 's ok . 
   visa free travel is literally the only thing i care about .
