  i could live with that . 
  it would actually make sense . 
  maybe you can convince your people ... 
  nah , we 're still waiting for your country to make it clear , that it does n't want in . 
  that would actually be the best . 
  but , no kidding , i 've actually been to a discussion pannel a few weeks ago and the serb ambassador to germany was one of the participants and i got the impression , that there 's nothing more important to your government * and * to serbs , than finally getting in ... and that 's annoying . 
  trust me , * we * would gladly let you sit outside , but somehow all the `` let us in , we are cool '' crying makes us look like bad nazis , when we * officially * oppose your plans to become a member . 
  especially considering the fact , that croatia and slovenia got in already . 
  so * we * have to stick to the narrative . 
  therefore , it 's up to you to make it clear , that you do n't want in , so that * we * can say : `` neato '' . 
   the whole refugee shit show is one of the things that really makes me wish we never join the eu . 
  no worries , the whole serb-kosovo shitshow makes the feeling mutual ... 
   some comrades nearly cried yep , sounds like the germany navy ... 
  this time for real !, 
  promised ! ... 
  anyway , the article is quite intriguing because it claims that : `` the putin economy strategy , despite criticism , seems to be working for the country . 
  the forecasts are pointing to the end of the recession continuing from the year 2017 . 
  the inflation is gradually coming down , helping stabilize russian economic growth . 
  the putin economy strategy of diversification seems to be working for the time being . '', 
  but on the other hand [ these ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/28225129.html ) guys say : `` the world bank is predicting 1.5 percent growth in russia 's gross domestic product in 2017 and sees a gain of 1.7 percent in 2018 and 1.8 percent the following year , helped by increases in commodity prices . 
  the stabilization in oil prices and the authorities ' policy response -- exchange-rate adjustment , banking sector capital , and liquidity injections -- improved the short-term outlook , helped restore confidence , and stabilized the financial system . '', 
  so no diversification , just the usual recovery and continuing reliance on commodities ( meaning oil and gas ) ? 
   make commenters look bad or stupid . 
  oh no worries mate , you manage to do that all by yourself , no edits necessary , xaxaxaxa ... 
   well , it 's not hard to me to apologize to poland right here ...  but pro-tip from a german , try it without the `` but '' next time . 
  maybe people will start believing you ... just apologize and stop talking . 
  apologizing and then finding excuses , etc , is what you do in kindergarten . 
  you know : `` i am sorry , * but * he started it ! '', 
  adults simply apologize , if they are sincere about it . 
  it 's ok ... this time it will be different ... promised ... / s, 
  lmao , you still think , that it actually does matter which side you support . 
  it really does n't . 
  the best policy is to keep out of those regional clusterfucks . 
  but , seriously , it 's ok . russia will get burned , just like all the other states , that tried to mingle in those regions . 
   the thing with syria is that russia keeps their intervention pretty low key and are only there to support syrian army . 
  just like the us/eu in lybia ... hmmm ...  both the rebels and isis are losing , and losing heavily . 
  like lybia , iraq ... etc. ...  neither the assad 's controlled territory , nor sdf controlled territory can be said that they are failed regions . 
  they are not , they are pretty well functioning like lybia , iraq , etc. ...  and russia supports both assad and sdf ( syrian kurds even have an office in moscow ) so if the rebels and isis are gone , russia will be left with pretty well functioning allies lybia ... you know the drill by now , i guess ...  ( i am not going to discuss the assad vs sdf situation , nobody knows what will happen there ) i 'll give you a hint : it begins with failed and ends with state ... 
  hmm , no ... it begins with r and ends with stilzchen ... 
  yeah , funnily enough they think , that they actually have a choice , xaxaxa ... 
  oh , you mean rothschild and soros , etc. . . got you . 
  i 'll move along then , do n't mind me . 
  in my opinion these conflicts are very different . 
  the russian government ( + military ) has a lot of experience with conflicts in the direct neighborhood . 
  they will wind down the conflict in ukraine to a similar low intensity conflict with 10-100 dead per year and they will control the situation , because they can dictate the rules of engagement any way they want . 
  syria on the other hand and the me in a broader sense is a new level of fucked up territory . 
  there is no solution . 
  i guess russia and assad will somehow manage to handle the crisis for about 10 years . 
  but they do n't have a plan and the ressources for a long term solution . 
  syria is going to become a failed state and russia will be tied to the bullshit that is going to happen . 
  but i 'm pretty sure that putin wo n't be around , when it will happen and that it 's going to be a problem for the fool following him ... 
   these unelected eurocrats . 
  you obviously did n't read the article . 
  the people quoted are : [ juan fernando l\u00f3pez aguilar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juan_fernando_l%c3%b3pez_aguilar ) `` l\u00f3pez aguilar has been a member of the european parliament since the 2009 european ** elections ** . '', 
  and : [ dimitris avramopoulos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimitris_avramopoulos ) dimitris avramopoulos ( greek : \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ) is a greek politician of the conservative new democracy party . 
  on 27 july 2014 , prime minister antonis samaras nominated avramopoulos as greece 's next member of the european commission . 
  * unelected eurocrats * ... sure buddy , whatever you say . 
  xaxa , yes , they are winning a commitment for the next decades , that will cost them a lot and bring nothing but problems in return . 
  but it wo n't be putin 's problem , so he does n't really care . 
  the us has been fucking with crazy for half a century now and is nowhere near any feasible solution for the mena . 
  funny that putin thought that it would be wise to stick his dick into a wasp nest ( metaphorically ... ), 
  i 'm gon na copy an older comment of mine from a few days ago , because i 'm too lazy to type all this shit out again . 
  but i really feel the urge to somehow educate you on the matter , because this `` thought police '' bullshit is fucking annoying . 
  so here it goes : this was the initial comment i replied to :  ok , strike the words `` even hypothetically '' from my comment above ( and while you 're at it , strike `` in the media '' , since you can go to jail for doing it all by yourself on the street , too ) and try again . 
  so you claim ( after the edit ) that : `` you can literally go to jail in germany for promoting pro-nazi political views . '', 
  i realize , that you 're against `` technicalities '' , but you have to understand , that the matter depends on them . 
  the problem is , that the term you use , `` pro-nazi views '' , is very broad . 
  it can encompass a lot of things . 
  the part of the law , which is used in such cases ( and i guess it 's the law you 're referring to ) is \u00a7 130 of our * strafgesetzbuch * ( german criminal code ) . 
  it is used very selectively and actually very carefully . 
  as you can see [ here ] ( https://dejure.org/dienste/lex/stgb/130/1.html ) there have been 591 rulings based on this law . 
  that is not a very high number , regarding your alarmist tone . 
  especially , when you take into account that those 591 decisions are not convictions . 
  often the judges rule in favor of the persons , who are accused of promoting `` pro-nazi views '' . 
  this ruling for example is very interesting : http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/4/11/4-129-11.php i 'll translate the important parts : 1 . 
  in interpreting the objective meaning of the defendants ' statements , the court has complied with the requirements which arise from the case-law of the federal constitutional court under article 5 ( 1 ) , first sentence , of the basic law : this basic right gives everyone the right to freely express and disseminate their opinion in word , text and image . 
  everyone has the right to express criticism , especially in the political struggle , especially in the public debate , even in exaggerated and polemic form . 
  opinions enjoy the protection of freedom of expression , without regard to their merit , value or correctness . 
  they do not lose this protection even if they are pronounced sharply and overly . 
  ** in principle , this also protects the right-wing extremist opinions . 
  ** you can translate the rest yourself ... what you can take away from it is , that you can express your `` pro-nazi views '' freely . 
  you can expect people to react accordingly and to report you in order to get you in front of a court . 
  then you can expect the judges to take a good look at your case and to decide whether the law can be applied in your particular case , or not . 
  therfore , you * can * literally go to jail for insinuating that gasing the jews is a viable policy . 
  ( i fail to see , why this is supposed to be bad though , imo . 
  insinuating that such a policy is legitimate , should be illegal in every part of the world ) . 
  in the case i linked to , the people took offense ( inter alia ) to : `` above the lectern , a poster was shown by the organizer , showing three people who had pulled their hoods over their heads and were wearing sunglasses . 
  one of the persons pictured held a beating stick in his hand . 
  the image was overwritten with `` germans resist ! '', 
  the picture included `` against foreigners , islamization and criminal foreigners ! '', 
  at the bottom of the poster stood : `` ausl\u00e4nderstopp.nrw.de '' . 
  during the speech of the accused some participants showed banners with the inscriptions : `` against islamization , superalienation and criminal foreigners '' . '', 
  the court ruled , that the things reported ( speech , banners , etc. ), 
  all fall under freedom of expression . 
  nobody went to jail . 
  so what 's the bigger picture ? 
  things are n't black or white . 
  freedom of expression is a highly protected value in germany . 
  i know you read a lot of bs in * your * `` media '' , but the actual court rulings wo n't support * your * `` truth '' . 
  oh , so you just wan na pick a fight then ?
