  you wan na one on one me ? 
  yeah ? 
  bring it on !, 
  i 'm all out of bubblegum !, 
  * le * yawn ... this is some really bad bait . 
  you lack the talent for good trolling , friendo . 
  you should at least link to u/domesticatedelephant comment , who explains the situation a little bit more : `` i 'm not sure where are you translating this from because it is completely wrong ... 
  here 's the actual statement by the court . 
  ( edit : breakdown/translation by dutch law student )  according to research done by the police the man from poland was driving at 120 km/h in a 80 km/h zone . 
  according to the court this could not be proven . 
  research showed possible speeds ranging from 76 km/h to 124 km/h . 
  so speeding could n't be proven beyond reasonable doubt . 
   because of the high speed he had lost control of his car and drove his car up on the bike path and hit the 3 victims . 
  research showed that the turn could be taken at a speed of 130 km/h or 80 mph . 
  so claiming that it was the speed that caused the crash seems incorrect . 
   the polish man [ ... ] said he lost control of his car because of technical failure . 
  although police research proved that this was not the case at all and that he did drive too fast the judge said it could n't be proven . 
  the judge actually threw out the `` technical failure '' defense and convicted him , so this is completely wrong ... 
  the problem was that the speeding could n't be proven and since he was n't drunk or texting either the court could not hold him directly responsible for the deaths , which lead to a low sentence . 
  in the appeal the prosecutor focused on witnesses statements to prove the driver was speeding and being unsafe , which lead to a prison sentence . '', 
  ( quote ends here ) ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ the comment chain goes on and u/beingabummer points out , that : `` but it does n't stop there !, 
  he went to the uk before he was convicted and the uk police had to bring him back to the netherlands to sit out his sentence . 
  and last week it became public that after more than half his sentence ( less then 9 months ) he appealed to be allowed to see his pregnant girlfriend in poland . 
  this was approved . 
  but because he has been declared an unwanted alien , he is not allowed to come back into the country . 
  which basically means he 's done with his prison sentence . 
  so not only did he lie , he fled the country once and then was released by the courts after 9 months . 
  the real kicker is that there is a council of sentences ( i do n't know what else to call it ) that reviews what to do with appeals like his , and they argued that ` convict 's quality of life is more important than the suffering of the relatives of the victims , and more important than the disturbed justice system ' . 
   gps is technically a us military system that 's the joke !, 
  :-) i am implying , that the russians do n't have a good system ... 
  ... i know ... german humor ... 
  i guess the mods are sleeping ... such reliable source ... totally objective and stuff ... 
  ... maybe the guys driving it want to upgrade the audio system of this thing . 
  you know ... a subwoofer , better radio , etc. . . or they want to buy a new and reliable gps for it ... 
   here in berlin he 's not widely known . 
  bwahahahaha ... sure buddy . 
  i know him , people around me , who actually read newspapers , etc. 
  and did n't live under a rock for the last few months , know him ... what the actual fuck are you talking about ? 
  are you for real ? 
  they could call it dacia , but then it would be mistaken for a car by many ... 
  roma ... romania ... you know the drill ... ... interestingly enough rome does n't get associated with gipsies . 
  anyway , it 's stupid . 
  you need more people spending time in romania and maybe they start changing their opinions . 
  being part of the schengen area might help in the long run . 
  i mean the mountains are nice and the beaches , too . 
  and a roadtrip through romania could be fun ... when you people start driving like fuckin normal folks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  until then it 's pure mad max dystopia !, 
  here , we see a man contemplating whether he could use tanks against protesters , too ... of course it 's just a wild guess ... 
  he might aswell just think about the sunny weather , or maybe he 's just glad , that he finally is able to fart freely ... 
   it 's weird how we 've become so desentesized against this sort of savagery while at the same time throw the biggest tantrum if someone in our ` tribe ' refuses to bake a gay cake . 
  nope , not weird , actually pretty normal and [ expected ] ( https://academic.oup.com/esr/article-abstract/27/5/636/598011/media-attention-as-the-outcome-of-a-diffusion?redirectedfrom=fulltext ) : here 's the relevant parts : the next finding from the diffusion literature that we incorporate is that diffusion tends to follow a path from higher-status and more powerful groups and individuals to lower-status and less powerful groups and individuals , or ` from the superior to the inferior ' , as tarde put it ( [ 1890 ] 1921 , p. 
  there are several reasons behind this pattern of diffusion . 
  on the side of potential adopters , more attention will be paid to high-status , powerful groups and individuals because the latter are generally more valuable sources of information than less privileged groups and individuals . 
  information coming from higher-status individuals and groups is more likely to be useful to potential adopters because the practices , technologies , and beliefs of higher-status groups may contain cues as to how the models have acquired their positions of status in the first place . 
  all other things being equal , imitating high-status individuals and groups is a better bet than imitating those of lower status than oneself ( boyd and richerson , 1985 ) . 
  in addition , focusing attention on information from high-status sources is valuable because what these powerful actors do and what happens to them is more likely to have consequences for oneself than the behaviour and experiences of less powerful actors . 
  finally , in as far as the actors who act as sources actively seek to spread their message ( i.e. 
  they act as ` change agents ' in rogers ' terminology ) , powerful actors will be in a better position to do so than actors who control few resources and have little prestige . 
  in line with these ideas , we expect that news events occurring in populous and rich countries will , other things being equal , receive more extensive coverage than events taking place in small , poor countries . 
  this expectation is based both on differences in the demand for , and in the supply of news . 
  on the demand side , we expect in our case that american , british and dutch journalists ( and their readers ) will find events in economically powerful and populous countries more relevant to cover because of the larger probability that events in these countries will have wider repercussions on for instance global markets , international security , or migration flows . 
  this greater relevance that is attributed to powerful countries will also have effects on the supply of news . 
  news outlets and press agencies have a greater density of correspondents in large , economically powerful countries than in small , poor ones . 
  the supply of news from large and rich countries is further enhanced by the fact that these countries will be in a better position to actively mobilize worldwide attention . 
  science !, 
  how does it work ?!, 
  wonder where science will lead us to ? 
   i think that it would be foolish to not make identity a topic for the conservatives . 
  yeah of course . 
  i do n't doubt that . 
  i actually hope that they 're going to do it , but i hope that it will be merkel , as i think , that she is the only person , who would be able to `` moderate '' the course of the debate . 
  but hey , at least they did n't leave it to the csu ... that would have been a disaster . 
  seehofer starting a leitkultur debate would have been blown out of proprotion ... or that asshole s\u00f6der . 
  god , i hate that guy . 
   there are no proofs that something unusual is going on in chechnya . 
  meh , this shit again ... let 's be frank : there 's also no proof that everything is fine . 
  somehow gay people do n't seem to exist in that region ... i wonder why ? 
   you also get a civil debate going this way . 
  see it is already working . 
  we are already talking about the topic . 
  nah , we are talking about the guy , who started talking about ... something . 
  this will keep on until , my best guess is maybe sunday . 
  after that we will have the results of the french elections and we will move on . 
  the issue will plop up again , maybe at the end of august and is going to be used to influence a few `` undecided '' voters and after that it will disappear again . 
   honestly i do n't think leitkultur as a concept is something at least the cdu/csu is not behind . 
  i agree  and honestly i do think that a lot of people in the country do n't think it is insane either and the left attacking it by thrwoing around nazi accusations only will hurt them in my oppinion . 
  i also do n't think , that it 's insane or anything . 
  * buuuuuuuuuuuut * :-) ( i guess , the `` but '' is also part of a german leitkultur ... ) but i think , that it 's , again , the wrong time to do it ... and of course the wrong person . 
  i agree , that we need an open debate on the issue , i just do n't see , why it has to be now ? 
  ( i mean , i see it of course , but , why did n't we start the debate a year ago ? 
  or why not wait until after the election ? ), 
  the timing is retarded , because i do n't * feel * , that this is going to be an honest debate . 
  like you said yourself : the `` left '' will react in the usual way , the greens , too ... pretty much everybody is simply going to try to dominate the public agenda and all persons involved , who actually have the political power to influence the discussion , wo n't be talking * with * each other . 
  it 's going to be a `` symbolic '' debate , people will reiterate their `` positions '' on the issue and we wo n't get a single step further . 
  the debate will be burried again . 
  it 's a wasted opportunity to do it in a meaningful way . 
  i do n't believe , that we are going to have a * real * debate , which is going to help to assess the will of the german society regarding fundamental issues . 
  you should visit / r/slowtv . 
  they appreciate this kind of content over there . 
  although it 's a little short for their taste , i guess .
