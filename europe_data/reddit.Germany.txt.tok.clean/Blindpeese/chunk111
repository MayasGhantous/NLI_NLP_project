  against this background , and provided that the wearing of a burqa is perceived by the person concerned as binding , ** the wearing of a burqa falls within the scope of the freedom of religion from article 4 of the basic law . 
  to the extent that the burqa is worn due to other motives - for example , due to external compulsion in order to publicly demonstrate the inequality of men and women - it does not fall under the protection of religious freedom . 
  ** they keep on working on the question if one basic right is more important , than others ( human dignity , equality of men and women in our society , etc ) and how these basic rights collide . 
  then the report tries to find out if banning the burqa can be justified by weighing the basic rights against each other , from a constitutional law point of view . 
  ** their conclusion is : ** the wearing of a burqa is fundamentally covered by the protection area of freedom of religion from art . 
  4 basic law . 
  a ban on facial veil in the ** public sphere ** is an interference with the freedom of religion , which can not be justified by constitutional law , thus violating religious freedom . 
  a corresponding simple legislation would therefore not be compatible with article 4 of the basic law . 
  ** their alternative therefore is : ** for example , a ban on facial veil in public buildings , a ban on the facial veil while exercising a public office , and the ban on facial veil as a student can be considered . 
  that 's what the legislative is actually considering now . 
  so your `` choice '' argument is not completely right , the matter is way more complex , than you want it to be . 
  the world , once again , is not black and white ... 
   like , laws can include exceptions . 
  you mean like exceptions for religious reasons ? 
  so how do we decide which exceptions to allow and which not ? 
   i can not understand why ...  i do n't think i think i found a problem here ... 
   why on earth do i need to prove someone 's else conspiracy theory ? 
  more arguments i see ... oh wait , nope , still no arguments ... just the usual whining ...  what 's exactly your claim ? 
  that vcp partners and investors are orban stooges even though they lost millions to keep an anti-orban paper open for years ? 
  arguments ?! ... hmm ... noooo ... noooo ... 
  i did n't make any claim . 
  i am * simply * waiting for you to back up * your * claims with more than one sentence and without all the hyperbole and rhetorical ( often loaded ) questions . 
  are you capable of writing one comment sounding like an adult being ?! ... 
  ... to be honest , i get the feeling , that it 's going to be a long wait ... 
  i 'll go to bed now . 
  i 'll check tomorrow . 
  i am soooo excited !, 
   a conspiracy theory claiming one of the major global venture capital firms , who kept publishing a freaking newspaper haemorrhaging money for years , even after circulation dwindled to 20k , and even offered to basically give it away to anyone interested before shutting it down , is somehow in the pocket of orban because it eventually shut down the paper is n't providing `` arguments and insights '' . 
  ... hmm , yeah ... still no argument , just one long sentence . 
  * oh geez , i 'm sure op will provide a real good comment , backing up his claims , etc. . . i 'm sure ... i 'll just wait here , he will deliver , i know it , we can trust him , he sounds smart ... *, 
   edit : finally found a proper , if abridged , translation of a decent index article about the state of media at the end of 2016 . 
  it gets the picture accross . 
  you can link to the bti report if you want an unbrigaded view on the topic . 
  pages 7-9 provide an interesting picture of the hungarian media landscape . 
   good lord . 
  this is beyond surreal . 
  ...  bloody hell , this is absolutely surreal . 
  wow , you really have a point there , mate ... oh wait ... somehow , i missed the compelling arguments you made ... let 's see ...  i freaking know exactly why the paper closed !, 
  ... hmm , ok ... lookin ' further ...  when you get to the point where you ignore what the owner of the newspaper actually said ? 
  ! ... still no argument , but wait , there 's more !, 
   and ** we ** communicated it very well who 's we ?!, 
  are you actually getting paid by them ? 
  it almost seems that way , but anyways ... you managed to answer to a comment , that actually provided arguments and insights by lamenting around and calling for god and , i guess , the devil ... ?!, 
  very compelling :-), 
  til : orb\u00e1n has adversaries in hungary ... i mean real one , not the people protesting . 
   a magnate with positions in construction and agriculture who has recently expressed his preference for the radical nationalist jobbik party oh well , so the next election is going to be a battle between jobbik and fidesz . 
  i guess nobody expected that ... / s, 
   tell me a single eu country where the muslim community is not absolutely garbage . 
  you ca n't . 
  hmm ... the muslim community here in berlin , living predominantly in wedding and kreuzberg is quite ok . 
  i even like shopping there , because they have cheap and fresh fruits and vegetables . 
  so i told you something about a functioning muslim community , damn , i actually can tell you something , fuck me , what now ? 
  but i like this game , let 's play it . 
  obviously you base your judgement on news . 
  i doubt , that you base them on first hand experience with muslim communities , because , let 's see ... hungary does n't have any . 
  but ok ... 
  so let me do the same : judging on news articles i 've seen lately about hungary , the government is a dictatorship , the people can protest as much as they want , but nobody gives a shit and gipsies are getting killed by fascist . 
  holy shit !, 
  show me one democratic city in hungary !, 
  you ca n't !, 
  ( oh that 's fun , why did n't i come up with such a good way to make an argument ... it 's genious !!!!!!!! ), 
   if you have issue with the document they were referencing , tell them . 
  no , i do n't have to , because the guy also clearly mentioned lisbon and therefore obviously knows what he 's talking about ... you on the other hand ... 
   and it 's the treaty other 's have said is the relevant one . 
  which `` others '' ? 
  you should tell them to educate themselves . 
   we 're having a discussion , this does n't need to be about either you or me personally . 
  yeah , i agree , i was merely pointing out , that you 're not up to date on the topic . 
  i linked a relevant wiki article in an other comment . 
  you can read it and learn which treaties are the basis of the discussion , etc. . . have a nice day . 
   i 'm looking at the text of the maastricht treaty now . 
  yeah , that 's the wrong place ... you should look here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lisbon you do n't seem to be up to date on the topic ... 
   there 's a lot of talk about european values , but seeing as they are n't codified they get to mean whatever somebody wants them to . 
  here you go : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_2.1.2.html, 
  i 'll try to provide a better translation . 
  this version is really hard to read : before the changes , officials deciding the outcome of the application of the refugees for recognition of their status , had to listen to the applicants in person and asked the applicants to tell their stories . 
  this is how it should be nowadays , too , according to an internal order of the ministry of the interior , which is superordinate to the federal office for migration and refugees . 
  but in reality there is division of labor . 
  soffner ( name of the official ) has no applicant in front of him , only files . 
  he decides on applications from people he has never seen in person . 
  the separation of the officials listening to the applicants and the officials , who actually decide , whether the application gets approved or not , is part of the probably most radical work-acceleration programe prescirbed by a federal authority . 
  the official goal : officials of the ministry are supposed to process the mountain of application by the end of may . 
  the programe was designed by a consulting company . 
  it was supposed to prepare the officials for the high numbers of applications , to shorten the waiting period for aplicants and to make the government look good for the upcoming elections . 
  in fact , the programe helped the officials to process 700000 applications in 2016 . 
  at the same time the programe turned the ministry into a tough completion factory , where not only labor division but also time pressure and fear reign . 
  the pressure became so high , that it started to leak to the outside . 
  since the end of february , an anonymous letter from the staff has been circulated in the agency . 
  `` the employee as a human being , the asylum seeker anyway ... does not matter anymore . 
  the numbers fetishists are ruling - breaches of law are completely irrelevant . '', 
  short time before , staff representatives adressed their superiors in an internal letter : `` the targets are utopian ... and they promote faulty and superficial operations . 
  meaning : the federal office is working fast now , but not always correctly . 
  asylum attorneys and judges with whom the zeit has spoken complain about `` superficial hearings '' and `` shockingly bad translations '' . 
  they tell stories about refugees who should have never been permitted to remain in germany under current law , and those who should never have been rejected . 
  there you go . 
   you seem to be oblivious to the fact that everything was more or less allright , until adolphine and her lackeys aided by hordes of euphoric useful idiots decided it 's now time to change eu 's values . 
  haha , good one ... the values never changed . 
  you simply ca n't admit , that you did n't care for them , like ever ; and now , that people remind you of them , you like to pretend , that they never existed . 
  which is a joke . 
  therefore : read the contract , before signing it .
