  [ annexation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation ) in the realm of international law normally implies `` a certain measure of coercion , expansionism or unilateralism on the part of the stronger of the merging entities . '', 
  it is not * simple * `` political transition of land from the control of one entity to another . '', 
  you have to look at the historical context of the event . 
  the fact that k\u00fcstrin is polish now is based on the events of a world war . 
  it did n't just happen over night and your short summary of events in 2 sentences is ignoring all the shit that happened during 3 decades of history . 
  the new borders were drawn in the wake of the [ potsdam agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potsdam_agreement ) and the people deciding those borders were not polish . 
  a real annexation happened with the territory of k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  the way the rest of the german territories were divided , especially in the east , is from an international law point of view quite murky . 
  that 's why we needed the [ ostpolitik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostpolitik ) of brand to clear up the mess regarding the recognition of the new borders to the east by the frg . 
  drawing those lines on the map was n't that `` legal '' . 
  the status of the borders was disputable for years . 
  the [ treaty of warsaw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_warsaw_ ( 1970 ) was an important piece in order to establish normal relations to the east after wwii and it also helped germany to become a reliable partner for eastern states . 
  your comment pretty much ignores the stupid fuckery regarding [ polish borders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curzon_line ) and the resulting paranoia of our polish friends , when you ask them why they do n't want to rely on allies , when it comes to defending their borders . 
  k\u00fcstrin , like k\u00f6nigsberg , is a prime example how the soviets fabricated history . 
  in this context poland and germany were mere bystanders . 
   it 's an example that protests do n't do shit unless backed up by powerful interests . 
  yeah , romania would disagree . 
  protests do a lot and even the russian government is not immune of feeling the effects . 
  you could try to work as a teacher for english . 
  or look here for example : http://www.backinjob.de/aushilfen/minijobs/nebenjobs/nebenjob_english i googled for `` studentenjobs englisch '' . 
  it depends on your location , you can find quite a few international jobs in berlin . 
  it 's harder down south but worth a try . 
  if everything fails you can try our zeitarbeit firms . 
  they take anybody with a basic command of german . 
  but it is a form of modern slavery . 
  you should stick to the big companies like randstad or adecco . 
  they at least try to be professional . 
  the smaller firms are awful , do n't call them . 
  but it should be a last resort thing . 
  those companies are looking for workers . 
  it 's hard to combine studying with a part-time job with scheduled shifts . 
  here 's the actual [ `` reasoning '' ] ( http://www.stagn.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/stagn_publikationen/070829_text_er4_05_jordan.pdf?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=5 ) behind the map . 
  it 's in german , i 'll translate some of the key points but you 'll have to read the rest yourself . 
  so the map is based on a debate in the [ standing committe for geographic names ] ( http://www.stagn.de/de/home/home_node.html ) ( an institution established in order to somehow make recommendations on the naming of regions ) that has been initiated by an inquiry of the german foreign ministry . 
  the fm wanted the committee to comment on the possibility to name regions of europe according to political characteristics . 
  they obviously had a few conferences and then came up with a definiton of central europe . 
  saying , that there are 8 factors which help characterise the cultural space of central europe and which allow to draw borders accordingly . 
  kulturschichten ( die au\u00dferhalb mitteleuropas auch vorhanden sind ) historic influence of german and jewish culture ( as a specific feature ) additionally to slavic , roman and hungarian influences . 
  coexistence , or close succession of protestantism and catholicism , while orthodoxy and islam played a lesser role . 
  compared to east and seeurope early evolution of cities and of bourgeoisie , which became a balancing power to nobility , church , etc. 
  early existence of free peasantry . 
  tradition of local and regional selfgovernance caused by early political particularism . 
  cultural ( linguistic and religious ) and ethnic diversity within states . 
  ( 7 ) politisch und wirtschaftlich stets dem kontinent zugewandt ( und nicht nach \u00dcbersee orientiert ) politicaly and economicaly oriented towards the european continent and not towards overseas . 
  compared to western europe , late industrialisation , but compared to east and seeurope earlier industrialisation . 
  anyways . 
  it 's a lot of text . 
  the paper is mentioning that it is a cultural construct and can not be proven empirically 100 % but that it has merit to try to define spaces according to subjective criteria . 
  it is a recommendetion and should n't be seen as some kind of official statement of the government . 
  i 'll try the classic russian approach : where is the proof , that the `` anglo-saxon and american media '' has in any way performed a `` coup 'd ` etat in russia federation under the pretense of some quasi rights and freedoms '' . 
  i think this is a legitimate question , would n't you say so ? 
  do you have real proof ? 
  i somehow have my doubts , that putin is going to be overthrown by `` our media '' . 
  if there would be any chance for that , then the claim of the `` western world '' , that russian media outlets try to influence elections and politics in europe would be just as viable . 
  which is crazy , right ? 
  i 'm not sure what you 're talking about , but as a foreigner op would n't be eligible for any kind of help from `` the state '' anyway . 
  german authorities can be quite the pain in the ass regarding these things . 
  as a non-eu citizen her options in germany are limited to `` get help yourself , or get back to your country of origin '' . 
  ... and yeah , i do n't think that she could apply for refugee status . 
  yeah , the mods will delete this thread soon . 
  it 's not the correct subreddit for these kind of things . 
  i 'd also would say , that you should hop over to / r/germany . 
  as for your actual problem : try to get your papers sorted asap . 
  i guess you will need some kind of job to be able to live around here . 
  depending on the city you live in , it can get quite complicated to find a place to live , that you could also afford . 
  you should try around here http://www.wg-gesucht.de/ for starters . 
  and yeah , the asta at your uni can help . 
  they at least can listen and quite often have some kind of network in place for students in rather dire situations . 
  also , your bf is an ass , wtf is a short term couple ? 
  people these days , sheesh . 
  but to sum it up . 
  take care of your papers . 
  keep them up to date and try to keep your working permit . 
  find a job , contact asta , find a few friends ( we germans are n't that hostile , come on :-) ) and look for a wg . 
  how 's your german actually ? 
  depending on your experience you could also try to work as a studentische hilfskraft at your faculty . 
  it could help you survive the next few weeks until you get your life sorted . 
  and yeah , go to r/germany . 
  i think that anonymity is an important part of the internet , especially regarding political debates . 
  there are enough countries where political comments would get you into jail , therefore anonymity is a big factor in being able to voice your opinion . 
  besides , creating a fake identity on the internet is quite easy . 
  i think , that it would be more important to get the people to behave again . 
  we need to see the internet as an open forum , where we can debate and argue , loudly , with each other . 
  but we need to stick to some basic forms of human interaction . 
  we need to learn , that the internet is not some wild west where you can call for the death of jews and blacks and declare it as freedom of speech . 
  i mean you can do that , but then you also need to live with the consequences . 
  i sometimes get the impression that people think , that the laws are non-existent as soon as they are `` online '' . 
  yeah , i know , but i still do it now and then . 
  you somehow get a feeling for the discussion `` meta '' regarding certain topics . 
  also `` echo chambers '' . 
  even the most extreme opinions now and then gets you to read up on certain issues and to educate yourself . 
  but yeah , i 'm only talking about the usual online comment sections of news outlets . 
  reading youtube comments is a 100 % guarantee for permanent brain damage :-), 
  someone asked a question [ whether internet comment sections are a cesspool in every language ? ], 
  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61oj3e/are_comment_sections_cesspools_in_every_language/?st=j0rotb5z&amp;sh=8be13add ) it reminded me of an article i read online a while ago . 
  here 's the translation . 
  at least in sweden and germany there seems to be some people who try to do something . 
  ** fighters against hate on the internet : `` in comment sections the discussion is running out of control '' ** with #ichbinhier ( iamhere ) , 25,000 people stand up against hatred in facebook comments . 
  in an interview with the founder hannes ley we talk about the fight against hatred on the internet and where the fight is the hardest . 
  with a bill , presented by justice minister heiko maas on tuesday , things started to get moving in the fight against hate commentaries on the internet .
