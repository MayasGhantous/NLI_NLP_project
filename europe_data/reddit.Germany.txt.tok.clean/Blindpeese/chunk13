  the problem has long been known , but companies are shying away from addressing the issue , such as the social media company facebook , which has signed a self-commitment , but still deletes only 39 percent of the criminal content reported by users . 
  while the ministry of justice was working on the bill , one person took the matter into his own hands : hannes ley founded a facebook group , which opposes hatred in commentary columns . 
  under the hashtag #ichbinhier , there are people who respond to hate commentaries . 
  meanwhile , there are 25,000 people , and the trend is rising . 
  faz.net has spoken with the founder of the group * you founded the facebook group #ichbinhier in december , a counterspeech initiative . 
  you try fight the hate on the net with something more positive , how does it work ? 
  * if we see articles from the big media outlets , which have particularly many hate commentaries , we link them to our group and call for constructive comments . 
  we `` like '' each others comments and push them up in the comment sections . 
  with the hashtag #ichbinhier we mark our comments . 
  the idea comes from sweden , where the corresponding facebook group already has 66,000 members . 
  * and how exactly do you react to hate comments ? 
  * we have two different approaches . 
  if it is about criminally relevant comments , such as `` kill all blacks '' , then we report that . 
  comments like that do n't get discussed ; the responsible person is getting reported to the police . 
  in other comments , we try to show that a comment is generalizing too much and try to present a more differentiated view . 
  * is there a guide for this ? 
  with 25,000 members , there are a lot of different approaches . 
  * not all 25,000 members are taking part in the discussions , many support the action passively , several thousand `` like '' the comments and about 500 write really actively against the hatred . 
  but we do not have mandated opinions , we also see ourselves as a non-partisan . 
  the only rules are : no racism , no sexism , nothing extreme , and do not depreciate people . 
  and no agitation , of course . 
  but everything else is allowed , everyone can post their opinions . 
  * how are the reactions to #ichbinhier ? 
  * we get a lot of positive feedback from the media and the social media editors , who are glad that we can intervene and regulate discussions . 
  the haters of course hate us . 
  before , they were pretty much undisturbed , but now we are sometimes the majority in a discussion , which generates a bit of aggression . 
  extremists are accusing us of acting like a kind of `` opinion police '' . 
  they are trying to discredit us . 
  * you have a lot of experience with hate on facebook , where are the worst corners ? 
  * clearly at focus online , bild and n24 . 
  this is because the comment sections are not moderated . 
  polarizing headlines are released , which are seen as an open invitation to agitate and then nobody is moderating the comments . 
  it gets out of control regularly . 
  * what do you think about the bill by heiko maas , who wants to force facebook by law , to remove hate commentaries quickly ? 
  * it 's about time . 
  but i still do not believe that our group would be obsolete . 
  the debate culture on the internet does not change so quickly . 
  short answer : they have any kind of ethic in the usa ? 
  second answer : frome the rules of this subreddit : general community guidelines 4 . 
  text posts : we only allow text posts that are informative , well-researched , and stimulate healthy discussion . 
  please use / r/askeurope for simple questions . 
   if those people do n't want to be labeled like that , than not calling them that , is n't really that much of an issue imo . 
  yeah sure why not . 
  i just liked the way how he was `` not sure '' about romania ... 
  i have enough eastern european friends and it is never an issue . 
  it 's an issue for a very special breed and i like yanking their chain , that 's all . 
  it 's obvious that he thinks that the term ee has a bad connotation . 
  he 's trying to hide it behind some kind of geographical reasoning . 
  it 's dishonest . 
  he simply should admit , that he thinks that ee in his eyes is used by the `` west '' to look down on a certain region , or whatever , your argument is just as fine . 
  but instead he is dishonest , presenting alternative definitions and is `` not so sure about romania '' . 
  you simply are not able to accept that there are more ways to define a region than one . 
  that 's your problem . 
  regarding your `` geographical approach '' : the centre of europe is a point , i suppose . 
  it 's not in hungary afaik . 
  so please entertain me a little : how far is this `` central '' region then supposed to be ? 
  what is the best way to define what should be seen as central ? 
  are we going to draw circles around this point and arbitrarily say , that everything within 500km shall be `` central '' ... 1000km ... 1500km ? 
  or the countries around this geographic centre ? 
  their whole area ? 
  i mean why not , right ? 
  so suddenly hungary and poland , 2 countries with vastly different areas , become `` central '' europe . 
  although the farthest point of poland from the centre is significantly further away , than hungary 's . 
  but yeah ... details ... as long as `` we 're not eastern all is fine '' . 
  you know , the funny thing is how desperately you are trying not to be eastern europe . 
  like the term eastern europe is something bad . 
  tell me , what is wrong with sticking to the cardinal directions when defining regions . 
  what 's specifically wrong with north , south , west , east ? 
  why do we suddenly need centre ? 
  `` hey can you point me to hungary ? ... yeah sure , go towards centre , you sure will find it . '', 
   no it 's not . 
  it has nothing to do with the cultural and economical circumstances in the region . 
  but hey look , suddenly we realise that your geographical approach , i guess , has something to do with cultural and economical circumstances . 
  i somehow forgot that central european countries have a cultural and economical common core and history . 
  of course , if i would follow the line of hungarians dreaming of some `` greater hungary '' and giving out passports to anybody around completely unasked , then of course this cultural fairy tale suddenly makes sense . 
  the fact still remains . 
  as much as you want to construe some kind of cultural and economical region out of thin air , as much there will be other people , who will see it , as a strange fever dream of delusional minds . 
  you are eastern europe , ca n't `` alternative facts '' your way out of this . 
  i guess i hurt your feelings or something , must be a real sore point . 
  the more you try to talk your way out of this the funnier it gets for me . 
  i actually labeled your username as `` eeuropean '' with res , so i know how to call you the next time . 
  man this is fun !, 
   and that 's why this relativist narrative you 're explaining ... hmmm ... ok ... `` relativist '' ... for me you 're [ eastern european ] ( http://eurovoc.europa.eu/drupal/?q=request&amp;uri=http://eurovoc.europa.eu/100277 ) . 
  you can try your relativist approach as much as you want ... idgaf . 
  this definition is as good as your geographic approach . 
  often used by people who simply do n't want to be * eastern european * . 
  ca n't deny what you are , maaaaaan . 
   i do n't think so , this sub is full of people that are very pro eu but very far right wing on everything else , especially the eastern europeans here . 
  that 's funny , i just read an article exactly on that topic . 
  it 's in german , but you can google translate it if you want : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/europaeische-union-junge-osteuropaeer-wollen-freizuegigkeit-aber-keine-fluechtlinge-a-1139656.html it says that young eeuropeans like free movement but do n't want refugees . 
  the data is based on this poll , also in german : https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/bst/publikationen/grauepublikationen/ez_flashlight_europe_2017_02_dt.pdf, 
   i do , however , know of plenty of central european ones . 
  yeah , i 've heard about `` central europe '' . 
  but the truth actually is that `` everything which is east of me is eastern europe '' . 
  ask germans , whether poland qualifies as eastern europe , you would get many `` yes '' answers . 
  eastern europe is a wide concept . 
  the last expansion of the eu is called eu-osterweiterung in german . 
  i 'm pretty sure , that hungarians think that romania qualifies as ee , but they themselves do n't see them as ee . 
  but ask austrians whether they think if hungary is ee or not . 
  the joke in my circles therefore is , that the ee border is magically shifting to the east all the time depending on who you ask what ee is .
