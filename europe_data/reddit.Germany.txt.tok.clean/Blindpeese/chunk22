  oh yeah , wait , we do n't . 
  you 're simply here to propagate false information to the people not actively participating in this debate . 
  you want to somehow create the image , that this debate is about censorship , fascism and whatever else . 
  people will show you that you 're wrong , but it does n't matter , you will throw around the usual bullshit , like `` ministry of truth '' and `` germans should know how this is going to end '' ... to answer your question : our laws . 
   you 'd think they 'd know pretty well what kind of path this leads down . 
  you mean the last 60 years of peaceful coexistence ? 
  oh no , please , who would want anything remotely close to that ? 
  who ? 
  you mean prosecuted and [ acquitted ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/in-der-strafsache-jan-boehmermann-der-freispruch/13470870.html ) ? 
  yeah , stupid rule of law . 
  why should we adhere to them ? 
  we need strong leader , telling us what we need to do and ignore the rest . 
       let people say what they want and let the others confront them . 
  yeah , because it worked out so well the last time , right ? 
  a few millions killed in gas chambers ... that freedom of speech really helped them a lot . 
  oh , you mean our authorities shutting them down ? 
  like here for example ? 
  http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/salafisten-verein-verboten-de-maiziere-mit-religionsfreiheit-nicht-vereinbar/14843162.html how about reading something else than breitbart ? 
  i think you refer to this [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strafgesetzbuch_section_86a ) . 
  they do n't concern the holocaust , the holocaust and the nazi regime are the cause for that kind of legislation . 
  saying that you hate jews , is n't illegal per default . 
  you can say that , if you really want to . 
  many muslims here in berlin openly admit to hating jews . 
  wait , if you do n't like that , would you maybe like watching a [ livestream ] ( http://slowtv.playtvak.cz/prave-ted-mazaci-tramvaj-jede-prahou-d73-/mazaci-tramvaj.aspx?c=a150908_111659_mazaci-tramvaj_plap ) of a tram driving through prague ? 
   i 'm not sure where you 're drawing the line between a presidential system and a `` full '' presidential system i 'm not drawing the lines anywhere . 
  the definitions are quite clear for people knowing what they talk about : [ presidential system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_system ) [ semi-presidential system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semi-presidential_system ) like i said , there are significant differences , at least , again , for people writing studies , essays and books about these kind of topics . 
  often found in the field of comparative politics . 
  they even have a nice [ journal ] ( http://jcp.gc.cuny.edu/ )  but india has a president as head of state and commander-in-chief , and independent legislative and executive branches , like us . 
  [ india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_india ) is a federal parliamentary constitutional republic . 
  let me quote some of the wiki text here : `` however , the role of the president of india is highly ceremonial . 
  all the powers of the president mentioned above are exercised on recommendation of the union cabinet , and the president does not have much discretion in any of these matters . 
  the president also does not have discretion in the exercise of his executive powers , as the real executive authority lies in the cabinet . 
  the current president is pranab mukherjee '' what does the same wiki page say about the prime minister and his union council ? 
  : `` the union council of ministers , headed by the prime minister , is the body with which the real executive power resides . 
  the prime minister is the recognized head of the government . '', 
  so ... india is just like `` us '' ( i guess you 're comparing it to the us ) . 
  could you please kindly point me to your prime minister , you know , the guy who has the power to govern your country ? 
  how many eos did he sign lately ? 
  wan na try again ? 
  also :  but most of europe has been democratic for less than one lifetime . 
  first : what the fuck ? 
  how 's that an argument in your `` hemisphere '' . 
  second : without those european democratic legacies the us would n't have any kind of system . 
  are you actually trying to troll me , or are you simply talking out of your ass , without any knowledge about the whole topic of political systems ? 
  what 's your point actually ? 
  how is your comment a reply to the things i wrote ? 
   practically every country in the western hemisphere is a republic and has a president as head of state . 
  you realise that this is actually not the point i was talking about ?!, 
  but anyways , what 's the `` western hemisphere '' ? 
  the countries in europe have actually predominantly a parliamentary system . 
  fun fact : india and taiwan are parliamentary republics . 
  full presidential systems are actually very common in north and south america . 
  i assume , that is the reason why your perception is a little skewed . 
  the rest of the world opted for semi-presidential and parliamentary systems . 
  but yeah , stating , that many countries have a presidential system is not wrong . 
  but it is not a clear majority , if you 'd like to imply that . 
  also the differences between all those countries are quite significant . 
   i study history myself and consider an intellectual analytical approach critical . 
  there is nothing about your statement that can be considered an intellectual analytical approach . 
  or are you studying at an alternative university ? 
  you stated , that you simply disagree . 
  you did n't provide a conclusive hypothesis yourself . 
  you just stated , that you do n't like his opinion and , that you have your own opinion . 
  you did n't provide anything that could be a basis for comparability . 
  you could have taken certain statements made by that professor and provide your own view on them based on [ theories ] ( http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/levitsky/files/mainwaring_shugart.pdf ) you deem more suitable . 
  the last paragraph was more or less a simple nod [ to the people arguing ] ( https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=presidentialism+vs+parliamentarism+pdf&amp;hl=de&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewimjyj64dxsahwob8akhqlkcduqgqmihzaa ) whether presidentialism is better or worse than parliamentarism . 
  and he is right , that so far people arguing for the benefits of presidential systems could always point to the us case . 
  the hypothesis , `` that presidentialism is less likely than parliamentarism to sustain stable democratic regimes '' ( linz , 1985 ) , could so far not be validated , because we have a few cases ( the us being the most prominent one ) showing that the hypothesis is n't completely true . 
  the us case is one of the most important ones , due to the history of the us ( hey look history , yay ) . 
  if the us should lose the independence of certain institutions and thereby become [ comparatively ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_politics ) less democratic , than other states , then the debate among scholars would shift again . 
  so please tell me , what is your input as a historian on this issue , besides `` i disagree '' . 
   i 'm not a professor at constitutional law , but i 'm still allowed to share my opinion about the article . 
      comparing european politics to what has happened after the election in the us has just become way to common in my opinion . 
  `` anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life , nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ` my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge . 
   it 's actually information we can look at and not predictions . 
  wait , since when does information matter ? 
  oh wait , i get it , this information matters objectively more , than other information . 
  some might call that `` bias '' , i also read something about cognitive dissonance , or mental gymnastics . 
  i do n't give a fuck , i merely enjoy throwing all that shit back now , for the lulz . 
  then you should absolutely go over to / r/slowtv . 
  you will waste hours !, 
   but we do n't need experts that 's exactly my point . 
  we obviously did n't need any experts for brexit , why should we need any now ? 
  the economic arguments were n't important at all during brexit , why should they now ? 
  let scotland take back control !, 
  nope , also read it as pizza ... must be a sign . 
  from today on it shall be known as pizza tretorri !, 
   but i personally have never met anyone that 's ok . 
  sadly you also did n't met your political leaders personally . 
  they do n't seem to be that happy about the whole referendum thingy . 
  and eventually , they will be the ones deciding . 
  not you . 
  which is sad , really , because i 'd rather have the brits decide about it , than your politicians , to be honest . 
  and who actually gives a fuck at all ? 
  there were enough reasons for the uk to stay in the eu and nobody cared , or at least 51 % did n't . 
  this whole thing is complex as fuck again , but people will , again , decide based on their gut feeling . 
  i 'll tell ya something , the most telling tale there ever was on reddit : i do n't care !, 
  it 's your fuckin ' shit !, 
  but there is an element of hipocrisy in this whole issue , which makes it ridiculous . 
  the uk fucked scotland royally .
