  yeah sorry scottland , nothing you say is important and you need to stay anyway . 
  no choice for you , thanks for staying . '', 
  lmao . 
   well , no one expects it to hack kremlin computers , but at very least they should be able to keep internal checks on far-right and extremist movements in slovakia . 
  police has to do that job and they are not stellar at it either . 
  hmm , that 's interesting . 
  in germany we have the [ verfassungsschutz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_office_for_the_protection_of_the_constitution ) and the [ bundeskriminalamt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_criminal_police_office_ ( germany ) . 
  they are not classical secret service agencies . 
  they are both the main agencies taking care of extremism from all sides . 
  the [ bnd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_intelligence_service_ ( germany ) is the state secret service agency . 
  the army has an own agency [ mad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milit%c3%a4rischer_abschirmdienst ) . 
  so we have a few agencies but the ones that primarily deal with extremism are the verfassungsschutz and the bundeskriminalamt . 
  maybe you need dedicated services , too , somewhen . 
  a classic secret service agency should take care of external threats . 
  forcing it to deal with internal threats , too , is maybe a little inefficient . 
  in my opinion political extremism is an issue for internal agencies and the judiciary . 
  fuck the remain voters in the uk then ? 
  hmm , i do n't know anything about it but i assume that the budget for any kind of secret service activities must be rather small in slovakia . 
  therefore i also assume , that it can not do a lot against the things the russian fsb and gru plan on doing . 
  the asymmetry regarding the range of capabilities between russia and slovakia must be quite big . 
  i think , that their only chance is to cooperate with bigger agencies , but you know how well secret services cooperate ... 
  pure assumptions on my side , so you can correct me on any of them . 
  what 's the history of the sis ? 
  does it have any kind of expertise ? 
  a secret service for such a small country is presumably focussing on single issues . 
  i think that they took more care of industrial espionage and need to adapt to information warfare now . 
   but sis , as always , does jack shit about it . 
  what 's sis ? 
  that 's what the [ eastern orthodox catholic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_orthodox_church#name_and_characteristics ) church came up with . 
  i simply call them orthodox . 
  although most of the time i refer to the regional branches and call them by their autocephalous names , like russian orthodox , serbian orthodox , etc. , depending on the church . 
  which again shows how different all these christian churches actually are . 
  eastern orthodoxy is not very close to the western catholic church led by the pope . 
  it is part of the federal budget . 
  the 21 billions are part of the total sum and not extra . 
  you can check the 2017 budget online if you want and if you understand german . 
  some parts can be found under `` interior ministry '' : https://www.bundeshaushalt-info.de/#/2017/soll/ausgaben/einzelplan/06.html they plan to spend 8,9 millions . 
  3,2 millions for the police , 896k for integration , etc of refugees . 
  you can read the rest yourself . 
  but anyways , all the money is part of the annual budget and it is spread across different sectors . 
  it also contains exotics stuff like `` zuschuss des bundes an die `` stiftung f\u00fcr das sorbische volk '' ( grant of the state for the `` foundation for the [ sorbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbs ) '' ), 
  i 'm going to answer myself , because the follow up comment alluding to the issue of security has been removed . 
  it is one of the main topics regarding immigration so we should n't `` sweep it under the rug '' , right ? 
  here we go : my original reply to a comment , that got removed , while i was typing : first of all , this topic is about money and the economic impact . 
  therefore i posted the facts on that particular issue . 
  now you want to make it about the `` perception of women '' regarding the issue of security . 
  well then , ok . let 's do this : here 's a nice read from australia for starters : http://www.crc.law.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/49993/aussa_indermaur&amp;roberts.pdf `` beliefs and opinions about crime are shaped by widespread consumption of news and entertainment about crimes , police , courts and prisons . 
  attitudes about crime and justice reflect judgments about social threats and harms , and perceptions of personal safety as well as beliefs about criminal offenders . 
  over the last 20 years , advanced democracies have become preoccupied with crime and embraced greater levels of control . 
  this movement has been described as a ` culture of control ' by david garland ( 2001 ) , one of the foremost commentators in the field . 
  garland draws on contemporary research on attitudes to crime and justice , which reveal two competing emotional responses : anger and fear . 
  as roberts et al. 
  ( 2003 ) point out , both media and politicians have a role to play in this culture , exploiting fear and misunderstandings about crime for votes and ratings . '', 
  and here 's one for europe : [ `` immigration and crime : new empirical evidence from european victimization data '' ] ( http://ftp.iza.org/dp8632.pdf ) `` our findings seem to suggest a misconception of the link between immigration and crime among european natives that is reflected in crime perception being strongly associated with a negative attitude toward immigrants . 
  the public perception of the effect of immigration on crime may be partly misled by the casual empirical evidence available to the public . 
  natives may observe that areas where immigrants are more prevalent are also generally those characterized by higher crime rates , failing to impute such correlation to unobserved third factors and to distinguish correlation from causation . 
  however , the cross-sectional correlation between immigration and crime is small , suggesting that other factors previously investigated by the literature may generate such a bias against immigration , including the media 's misrepresentation of the immigration phenomenon and political opportunism . 
  our empirical findings call for a better public assessment of the immigration phenomenon in western europe , especially as regards its implications in terms of criminality , and for a more transparent approach to the discussion about the costs and benefits of immigration in host countries . '', 
   fill your streets with organized crime i can find you data showing that organized crime has been a problem for a few decades now . 
  we have the italian mafia clans operating throughout europe , we have the russian mafia , we even had romanian mafiosi for a while . 
  here in berlin we had for years now problems with biker gangs . 
  hell 's angels vs bandidos . 
  so , what 's your point exactly ? 
  syrian refugees selling drugs , actually i 'm pretty sure that the majority is of north african origin , are people , who integrate into the existing organized crime structures . 
  we would have them with or without new refugees . 
  interestingly enough [ human trafficking ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/trafficking-in-human-beings_en ) of refugees is a big income factor for organized crime . 
  you 're actually blaming the victims , which is pretty much indicative of your understanding of the issue . 
   drug dealers that stab each other constantly ? 
  feel free to define `` constantly '' . 
  also feel free to provide your own facts . 
  i guess mine wo n't be as black and white as you like it . 
  this fucking world , it 's so complicated , who would have thought that the world would be complicated ? 
  sad !, 
  what 's your point ? 
  you want facts , here are some : the state spent 21,7 billions . 
  this sum consists of 7,1 billions for the fight against the reasons for migrations ( local programes , etc. 
  ) , 1,4 billions for administrative things and housing , 2,1 billions for integration programes and 9,3 billions for the financial support of the federal states . 
  21,7 billions did n't just got paid to the refugees . 
  a big lump of that sum simply went into local industry . 
  housing had to be built , etc. 
  of ocurse you could invest that money in bridges and schools . 
  but that happens aswell . 
  so it 's not a net loss . 
  furthermore about the impact of the influx on germany : https://www.iom.int/sites/default/files/country/docs/germany/germany-data-briefing-1jan2016.pdf `` according to the european commission , the arrival of asylum-seekers has had a positive economic impact on the gdp of eu member states , with an anticipated average contribution of 0.2-0 .3 % by 2017 . 
  this is especially meaningful in high refugee-receiving countries such as germany . 
  despite increased spending on accommodation and infrastructure for refugees , germany 's budget is expected to remain in ` sizeable surplus ' '' . 
  https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1602.pdf page 12 `` the expected initial effects on aggregate eu gdp are positive but small , with a more significant impact on the countries where the refugee inflows are concentrated . 
  relative to the baseline , the level of gdp is lifted by about 0.05 , 0.09 , and 0.13 percent for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , respectively ( solid line in the chart below , representing the response of eu gdp as a whole ) . 
  for the first year , the output impact is entirely due to the aggregate demand impact of the additional fiscal spending . 
  labor supply is increasing as well , but the effect on potential gdp takes time to unfold . 
  the impact is quite different across countries , reflecting the asymmetric distribution of the asylum seekers relative to countries ' own population . 
  by 2017 , the largest impact is in austria , with gdp rising by 0.5 percent , followed by sweden ( 0.4 percent ) and germany ( 0.3 percent ) . '', 
  `` the medium-term impact can be larger and depends crucially on labor market integration . '', 
  and one last piece of information : [ burden or blessing ? 
  the impact of refugees on germany 's labor market ] ( http://www.aicgs.org/publication/burden-or-blessing-the-impact-of-refugees-on-germanys-labor-market/ ) well , there you go . 
  facts . 
  they are not as black and white , as you might prefer . 
  i guess you wo n't like them . 
  they do n't have enough hyperbole . 
  i know , that sucks .
