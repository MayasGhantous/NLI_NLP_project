  so you do n't have to prolong the other one after a certain period . 
  yep , therefore it 's not local news anymore . 
  buuuuuut : the 19 year old german boy who killed a 9 year old boy , because he wanted to kill somebody and because `` his life was shit '' , who then went on terrorizing the area for 3 days , because he decided to hide and killed another 22 years old man during that ... yeah , that would count as local boring news again , or it would n't be as `` controversial '' , or something ... 
  okay , i guess it could work . 
  are we calling it berwaw or wawber ... or bearwaw ... ... oooooooooor werebear oo !!, 
  i guess the confusion is prompted by the german expression of `` asylberechtigter '' . 
  the asylum law in germany is granting either the status of `` asylberechtigter '' , which literally means `` being entitled to asylum '' or `` fl\u00fcchtling '' which translates to refugee . 
  so if the request for asylum by the seeker is granted he gets one of the titles mentioned above . 
  the status of refugee or `` asylberechtigter '' grants you residence permit which allows you to stay here . 
  ~ ~ after 5 years you get the chance to apply for a working permit aswell . ~ ~ edit : was talking outa my ass . 
  the asylum laws are way too complicated for this time of the day . 
  there are a few legal prerequisites but refugees who get accepted are able to work legally . 
  they get an additional remark in their papers . 
  basicly every refugee is technically able to request the permission to work , which is not an extra working permit , but an additional remark in their legal documents . 
  but we need to decide on which warsaw to keep , yours or ours ? 
  teeth are ok , but it fell a little too often and has now quite the head injuries ... it is a little weird , tbh . 
  do n't bully it though . 
  come on ... it 's still better than warsaw ... ok , that 's not that hard admittedly . 
  but wts lower-saxony and thuringia . 
  maybe saxony aswell . 
  depends on offer . 
  we sadly need the rest , it has access to important resources ... hipster for example :-), 
   gon na have to take a train i 'd wish everybody luck who would have to take a train anywhere in germany , regardless of destination , etc :-) i wish you luck , that the goddamn thing is on time and you do n't miss any connections . 
  wtb certain parts of pl , wts certain parts of de . 
  willing to discuss matters of naming new entities . 
  if strong enough also willing to discuss `` reunification '' with k\u00f6nigsberg oblast :-), 
  a few rich americans is not `` america '' . 
  but gud try buddy pal . 
  reeeeeeeeee, 
  i guess you 're not up to date on the new strategic approach regarding the eu . 
  do you remember the [ domino theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domino_theory ) . 
  you get the same annoying approach for the eu now . 
  ukip and brexit was the first step . 
  the next elections will be the election in the netherlands , followed by france and then followed by germany . 
  all within this year . 
  so brexit is a done deal , now `` they '' insinuate , that they only have to push the anti-eu parties in the other countries and you have the core of the eu more or less destroyed . 
  it 's of course a 60d long con strategy game . 
  but the plan is to destabilize the core countries of the eu by pushing the parties that would want to dismantle the eu as far as possible . 
  according to trump he would prefer bilateral treaties and he ca n't stand the eu . 
  as far as i can see , in `` their '' perception , the eu has become too powerful and ( maybe ) independent . 
  it 's on its way to become a new power pole in our multipolar world . 
  i assume , that the trump administration would prefer to deal with single states in the future and not with a powerful eu . 
  former administrations viewed a powerful eu as a stabilizing force . 
  the trump administration seems to disagree . 
  i assume that you can read german stuff therefore i 'd recommend you the following site : http://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/ it will provide you with the basic information regarding the political parties , their histories and their ideas . 
  i think it 's pretty much all you need to get a very objective basic sense about the political landscape here . 
  it will help you understand where schulz/merkel come from . 
  i think that you could get a sense of the differences when you approach them from their parties . 
  there 's also the wahlomat . 
  http://www.bpb.de/politik/wahlen/wahl-o-mat/ any time there 's some kind of election , there is also an iteration of the wahlomat for it . 
  it basicly translates the political programme of the parties into simple statments you either agree , or disagree with and presents you at the end a ranking of the parties based on your answers . 
  you also get a summary of the corresponding part of the political programme of the party related to the statements so you can read up on their ideas . 
  so you get a nice list telling you something like : based on your answers you agree most ( 80 % ) with the cdu followed by the spd ( 75 % ) and so on . 
  : media : as for tv i 'd recommend watching zdf heute at 1900 followed by the news on arte at 1915 . 
  this way you get a german view followed by an european view :-) it 's almost like r/europe on tv . 
  [ berlin direkt ] ( https://www.zdf.de/politik/berlin-direkt ) is also pretty nice for a more in depth view with longer interviews of political party leaders . 
  [ bericht aus berlin ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/bab/ ) is the ard version . 
  it 's a little different but i guess it boils down to a matter of personal preference . 
  i like the zdf version more . 
  just test them . 
  that should help you to get the information you need ... 
  yep , we also have the \u00d6 ... but it 's always kinda annoying in the english speaking/writing world to be honest , because you never know if it gets diplayed correctly on the other side . 
  so i often stick to the `` normal '' letters . 
  the more you know : in germany you are sometimes forced to write the \u00c4 as ae nad \u00d6 as oe , when filling out forms for example . 
  or in crosswords :-) but , when a german sees an ae he knows it 's supposed to be an \u00c4 . 
  anyway , i know the correct version of his name , but i adapt it often to the english speaking `` audience '' in order to not overcomplicate things . 
  if this would be r/formula1 i would use the correct version . 
  but it was just a comment intended as a stupid joke ( although , of the 3 i like kimi the most :-) ) therefore i did take the shortcut using the english alphabet . 
  bwaaaaaaah , sometimes i 'm lazy ... 
  haha , it 's you again . 
  i just saw you in the thread about the guy wielding an axe in d\u00fcsseldorf . 
  are you keeping your fingers crossed , that this time the suspects are brown and/or muslim and/or somehow refugees and/or at least immigrants ? 
  in b4 italian muslim immigrants :-), 
   if this sub did n't consistently downplay the issue . 
  waiting for verified information ... * downplaying the issue * hmmmmm, 
  yep , me too , i was like : huh , wait what , huh ... oh now i get it . 
  also : prime example of a mini echo chamber : i do n't know anybody , me neither , ok then it 's settled , good . 
  :-) ... while the positive guy gets all the upvotes :-), 
  bwaaah , it 's raikkonen all the way . 
  the others do n't even lift !, 
  funnily enough it seems that it 's the same in english ( oder ) at least if we can believe wikipedia . 
  so i was technically correct ... without realising it . 
  it 's the german way :-) yeah , i actually did n't check and i simply assumed that polish people would know what i 'm talking about . 
  my bad , but here in germany the term [ oder-nei\u00dfe-grenze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oder%e2%80%93neisse_line ) is a part of our `` we are sorry for ww2 '' heritage :-), 
  here you go guys , it 's from 2003 but still actually quite the useful info source on the issue of language quotas in the media of osce member countries . 
  http://www.osce.org/hcnm/78058?download=true this is nice : `` there are states in which the broadcasting sector generally -- public and private - is under an obligation to use and promote the official/state language . 
  these include : albania , andorra ( where the provision applies equally to programming and advertising ) , armenia , azerbaijan , bulgaria , croatia ( in the standard croatian language ) , cyprus , denmark , estonia , france , georgia , greece , iceland ( promote ) , latvia , lithuania , the netherlands , portugal ( promote ) , russia ( where the programmes of national television and radio must be broadcast in the russian language , but in the regional mass media , the state languages of the republics , as well as other languages of the peoples living on their territories may also be used ; advertising must , however , take place in russian ) , slovenia , slovakia , spain , sweden , tajikistan , turkey , turkmenistan ( `` development and active use '' ) and ukraine ( where the national broadcasting council adopted a decision in june 2002 obliging television and radio companies to ensure that their own programmes are totally in ukrainian within one year ) . '', 
  there is also a lot of information on the system of language quotas . 
  and you can read up on the laws of all the countries regarding langauage policies for the media . 
  tl ; do n't want to read : ukraine is hardly the first to do so . 
  literally every country in europe has by now some kind of provision . 
  do n't panic . 
  this is not ukrainian fascism . 
  welcome 3 days old user ... nice to have you here . 
  let 's see what you 've been up to lately :  european antifas ( german especially ) are even more nuts than the americans . 
   the good thing is that an average antifa member is a 55kg junkie who runs out of breath by the time he walks out from the bus that was paid for by the ngos ( or goverment ) to get him to the demonstration so these people are n't really threating unless they jump you with an advantage in numbers . 
   one thing to remember about antifas is that those pussies never go for a fair fight because they ca n't ever win it . 
  ok , now i understand the sentiment . 
  at least you do n't waste time with pleasantries and go straight for the jugular , xaxaxa . 
  thanks for the up to date news from the other side of the oder :-),
