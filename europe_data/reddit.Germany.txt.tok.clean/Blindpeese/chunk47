  sort by new and you 're in for a fun ride . 
  you can pinpoint the time , when america started waking up :-), 
  although , to be honest , the info `` migration background '' has some meaning here in berlin at least . 
  it triggers a bunch of programs etc. 
  by the jugendamt concerning children and young people . 
  for example , if a kid in the kindergarten has migration background he/she is elligible for extra german lessons , when there 's a need for it . 
  also he/she gets extra councelling by people in order to help along with integration . 
  so , i 'm not completely against the use of that metric . 
  it has its meaning in a certain context . 
  but overall it is useless when talking about `` we are getting overrun by everybody , hurrdurr '' , because , like you said , people from switzerland , sweden , etc also have a migration background . 
  and i picked the religion statistic only because the guy i replied to seemed to have the illusion that we are getting replaced by `` barbaric , uncivilized muslims '' . 
  which is obviously not happening ... 
  thanks for the heads-up , shit 's hillaaaaaaariiooooous . 
  this thread is pure gold . 
  someone needs to archive it bwahaha, 
  bwahaha ... oh mah sides ... wait ... bwahahahaha ... let me cite a few of your comments from your comment history :  reddit is like a clubhouse for extremely stupid people who think they 're smarter than everyone else . 
   wow . 
  you 're just straight up retarded . 
   i do n't know why i 've wasted this much time arguing with you . 
  you are fake news . 
   people sure are gullible . 
  and so on , yadayada ... lmao . 
  this thread is seriously too funny when you sort by new . 
  such butthurt . 
  btw : you came to the wrong neigbourhood friend , xaxaxaxaxaxa ... 
  ok , let 's do [ this ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesellschaftstaat/bevoelkerung/bevoelkerung.html ) 82,2 mill people . 
  8,7 mill are foreign . 
  17,1 have a `` migration background '' , which means that they are german citizens but at least one of their parents were foreign somewhen . 
  also , they are not all turkish but from parts of the world you would rather accept , the fuck do i know , who you like or not . 
  or let 's make it about [ religion ] ( https://fowid.de/meldung/religionszugehoerigkeiten-deutschland-2015 ) because of your comments ( uncivilized , turkish ) . 
  4,4 % are muslims . 
  to sum it up :  being replaced with uncivilized people nope , not really . 
   make scale dioramas uuuh , nice , gib pictures !, 
  no , seriously , i like dioramas . 
   i write fantasy nope , not gon na want to see that . 
  5,3 million refugees since 1953 . 
  about 80 million people living in germany . 
   being replaced with uncivilized people ... yeah , 5,3 vs. 80 ... hmmm ... 
  bwahaha , comparing r/europe to the donald . 
  the sub is pro-eu in a sense that it would like the eu to continue existing . 
  but please do n't try to ask in this sub in which way the eu should continue to exist . 
  you will get a lot of opinions on that one . 
  and come on , r/europe is not left-wing per default . 
  it depends on the issue . 
  therefore : safe-space ? 
  really ? 
  i guess i 'll be more specific the next time . 
  i simply did n't agree with the first guy who tried to depict the numbers as inflated or something . 
  i still think , that the reports ( they come quarterly obviously ) do n't have a `` leftist '' bias or something . 
  quite the contrary . 
  the department of the interior as a cdu department would rather like to depict the refugee story in a `` nicer '' way . 
  showing clearly that there is quite the vocal and sometimes violent opposition from the people is not backing up the stories of `` willkommenskultur '' etc. 
  they show that germany also has quite some problems when dealing with the refugee issue . 
  therefore , i agree with your comment . 
  nevertheless nitpicking on the nature of the offenses is not going to change the fact , that we have quite a serious problem here . 
   which is ironic no it 's not ...  when the comedian jan b\u00f6hmermann is under trial in germany for insulting erdogan no he is n't . 
  guess you missed the latest news on him . 
  does n't surprise me a lot . 
  they do n't echo so well ... 
   i just think it 's low-effort ... * looks at the pictures , sees a lot of well done parade wagons , nice colors , seems like a lot of work * so what have you done today ? 
  i do n't get your point . 
  now we start nitpicking and discussing every last detail of `` sachbesch\u00e4digung '' ? 
  the inquiry was about attacks on shelters and refugees ( and protests ) done by people from the extreme right ( which is not surprising , because the inquiry is initiated by die linke ) . 
  therefore i am going to assume that `` graffiti '' , which can be part of the offense `` sachbesch\u00e4digung '' , will encompass such nice things as swastikas and different slogans hinting at the underlying xenophobe attitudes of the perpetrators . 
  but yeah , ok , let 's exclude that from the list and we 're down from 10 attacks per day to 5-6 . 
  well , alllrightyyy then . 
  i guess this makes everything better . 
  i simply do n't see what we are arguing about . 
  which detail is going to make the whole issue more appealing ? 
  `` graffitis '' on refugee shelters , throwing in windows , destroying doors , etc. . . what about all that makes everything being ok again ? 
  are we now obsessing about definitions again ? 
  where do you want this debate to go ? 
  i 'm simply intrigued . 
  and yeah , i scrolled through the whole list . 
  i am not going to sum up all the entries because it 's 90 pages worth of entries . 
  but looking at january alone is a very nice sneak-peek of the things the report has to provide you . 
  18 incidents on 7th january . 
  12 on 8h . 
  among them a lot of `` volksverhetzung '' also a few `` k\u00f6rperverletzung '' , etc. 
  the list is pretty straight forward . 
  i am simply amazed how we can actually argue about this shit here and now . 
  there are a lot of attacks per day in germany from the far-right and their `` friends '' on refugee shelters and against refugees . 
  the numbers reported are not hyperbole . 
  there is no bias , it 's a simple observation . 
  but yeah , of course , we can now argue whether `` sachbesch\u00e4digung '' can be seen as an attack or not . 
  and btw . 
  the guy i answered still did n't provide any source . 
  because yeah , i would be very interested in seeing how this issue can be seen as `` peaceful protest '' . 
  pictures 4 and 5 say : `` blond ist das neue braun '' meaning blond is the new brown . 
  brown is associated with righ-wing extremism , because the nazis wore brown uniforms . 
  so if you 're politically brown , you 're a fascist/totalitarian , etc. 
  picture 7 : erdowahn is a composite word made of erdogan and wahn . 
  wahn means delusion . 
  picture 8 : hate on muslims ; our useful idiots . 
  picture 9 : mammutti . 
  it 's a play on words . 
  merkel is often called `` mutti merkel '' ( mommy merkel ) . 
  so it 's a composite word again : a mammut ( mammoth ) + mutti . 
  picture 10 : `` bei zu viel wut im bauch ist die demokratie im arsch '' meaning : if there 's too much anger in you , democracy is fucked . 
  the stickers say : volksverr\u00e4ter , l\u00fcgenpresse ( traitors of the nation , lying press ) .
