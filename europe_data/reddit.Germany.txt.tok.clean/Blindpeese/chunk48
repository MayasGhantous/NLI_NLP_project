  two words often used by the right to describe the political class and the press . 
  it 's not about refugees raping women in sweden . 
  it 's about refugees being attacked . 
  the `` loud ones '' do n't tend to brigade these threads as much . 
  the only narrative they are regurgitating here is that the data includes violence among refugees . 
  which it does n't . 
  where did you look it up ? 
  because my [ source ] ( http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/102/1810213.pdf ) does n't back your `` claim '' . 
  it does not . 
  what is it with all you guys claiming that `` the data '' is including fights between refugees . 
  the data is based on reports by the government which were initiated by parliamentary inquiries by die linke . 
  the inquiries specifically ask about attacks executed by people belonging to the extreme right . 
  specifically !, 
  the data does not include fights among refugees . 
  you can also check my comment from yesterday on a similar thread . 
  i 'm not gon na repeat myself in every thread . 
  this is becoming tedious . 
  no it does n't , i commented on the other thread yesterday already . 
  the numbers are based on parliamentary inquiries initiated by die linke ( our leftist-socialist party ) and those inquiries specifically ask for crimes and attacks perpetrated by suspects belonging to the extreme right . 
  the numbers do n't contain any fights between the refugees themselves . 
  so stop claiming things which are not right . 
  if you want the sources you can check my older comments from yesterday . 
  yep yep ... very gud points , especially :  i do n't remember  i have not seen  i have not heard ... wait , let me sum it up for you again :  i you are very compelling . 
  i wo n't try to argue with you , because you are obviously way too well informed for me . 
   still there is no specific data about perpetrators . 
  i do n't know what kind of data you have in mind regarding the issue . 
  there is a lot of data in the documents but i am too lazy to be honest to compile all of it in some kind of handy spreadsheet . 
  one extract regarding the perpetrators for example can be found in 2016/3 page 4 : the question is about the number of perpetrators : the government is listing for the whole 2016 at that moment ( 2016/3 ) the following : a total of 1213 offenses caused by 1566 perpetrators . 
  in detail : 166 offenses against refugee shelters with 348 perpetrators 1022 offenses against refugees with 1189 perpetrators 25 offenses against organisations or volunteers helping refugees with 29 perpetrators . 
  a full list of the nature of the offenses can be found in the annex of 2016/3 pp . 
  7-96 ( have fun , it 's a lot of stuff ) . 
  the short translation is that the judiciary has n't any kind of reporting system , which would report back how many of the perpetrators have actually been punished or fined , etc. 
  so there 's no number on that in the report itself . 
  as for the rest . 
  if you 're really interested in the details you will have to go through the reports yourself . 
  i wo n't be able to translate everything . 
  it 's just too much work . 
  but like i said before , the reporting done by the press seems so far to be more or less accurate . 
  i 'm not going to compile all the data in order to fact-check , because it seems rather futile . 
  after reading through the reports for the last few hours the articles seem to be more or less trustworthy . 
  and i 'm gon na mention it again : the inquiry asked specifically about ofenses done by right extremists . 
  as is tradition for die linke ... 
  i really do n't know how to present you the data in a concise manner within the limits of `` reddit '' , but i 'll try . 
  i will point you to the resources but they are all in german . 
  first i have to tell you , that all the numbers ( as far as i am aware now ) have been generated through the collection of answers given by the german government to so called `` parlamentarische anfragen '' ( parliamentary inquiry . 
  all the documents can be found online . 
  the search engine is of course in german : http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21.web/welcome.do?resetnav=y ) the party asking all the related questions in a systematic order is die linke . 
  they began in 2014 and are asking every 4 months again for new and updated numbers . 
  here you have the question for 2016/1 : http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/081/1808197.pdf it is titled : proteste gegen und \u00dcbergriffe auf fl\u00fcchtlingsunterk\u00fcnfte im ersten quartal 2016 ( protests and attacks on refugee `` housings/camps '' in the first quarter of 2016 ) . 
  within the inquiry there are a bunch of detailed questions . 
  the interesting question in this case is 5 a + b , which has been expanded to 5 a-d in the [ 3rd quarter ] ( http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/100/1810071.pdf ) . 
  the question asks about the number of attacks on housings and in the 4th quarter additionaly about the number of attacks on refugees . 
  the important part in this context is that the inquiry explicitly asks about attacks from persons belonging to the extreme right . 
  therefore it does not include fights among refugees themselves . 
  here are the answers by the government : [ 2016/1 ] ( http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/083/1808379.pdf ) [ 2016/2 ] ( http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/093/1809324.pdf ) [ 2016/3 ] ( http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/102/1810213.pdf ) 2016/4 is not online yet . 
  the numbers from the 3 publicly available documents are : 319 +173 +129 = 621 attacks on housings in the 2016/1 +2 +3 . 
  they registered 374 attacks on refugees in the 3rd quarter . 
  now to the debate about sources and numbers . 
  providing all the sources would be quite tedious in written form within an article . 
  as you can see , the numbers have to be compiled by using the answers of the german government . 
  if you take the time and actually read the parliamentary inquiries you will realise that there are a lot of questions within those inquiries and that the answers in turn provide a lot of info , which can be useful for some and useless for others . 
  like i pointed out the `` report '' for 2016/4 is not available online yet . 
  to sum up my feelings about this topic : the number of 3500 seems high when compared to the data given by the government . 
  especially if you consider that the questions 5 c + d have been added for 2016/3 the first time . 
  those questions ask about attacks on refugees . 
  before that die linke only asked about attacks on housings . 
  nevertheless , when i try to add up the numbers provided i ca n't get to 3500 . 
  not with the available information . 
  but : the articles are all mentioning that they use numbers from a newly released answer for an inquiry initiated by die linke . 
  therefore i am inclined to give them a benefit of a doubt regarding the debate here . 
  die linke is specifically asking about violence from the extreme right and not about violence between refugees . 
  so , when combining the info available so far and a possible new and updated report for the whole year 2016 i am rather sure that the data presented here is not `` fake news '' or whatever . 
  the documentation system of the bundestag is reasonably fast but it will take some time till the newest numbers will be publicised online . 
  then everybody can sift through the pages themselves . 
  till then you will have to trust the news outlets to a certain degree . 
  and to stress it one more time : the numbers are pretty sure referring to attacks from the extreme right . 
  yeah , stupid bundesl\u00e4nder and their different training systems :-) at least i can laugh about the green uniforms of the guys in by , when i 'm there . 
  but i heard that they decided to change to blue , too , like the rest of germany . 
  took them long enough . 
  last time i was there i saw a green bmw driving around and i was like : what the hell , this must be a really old squad car ... hmm , wait ... it 's actually the latest bmw 3er series ... why is it green ? ... oh , it 's bayern ... i forgot ... they just need a little more time , than the rest of us :-), 
  hehe , you 're funny . 
  but it 's actually what i would expect from our police forces here . 
  they are trained professionals . 
  their training takes at least two years and it can take up to three years depending on the position they applied for . 
   if that 's what you call a shitty alliance that you do n't mind seeing fractured you are way too melodramatic . 
  the alliance has been shitty for a few years now . 
  it 's time to change the status quo because it is no longer sustainable . 
  pretending that the us are some kind of savior is also naive . 
  `` lol '' all the points you made were not rooted in some kind of altruistic motives on the `` other '' side . 
  the issues were and are more complex than pretending that the us are helping us because they feel some kind of `` special '' bond to europe and the `` values '' uniting us . 
  we need their help as much as we need the trade with china . 
  the interdependences between all actors ca n't be summed up under `` they '' are good and china is `` bad '' . 
  so yeah , the us and china are both heavily flawed world powers . 
  and the eu needs to find a way to deal with both of them within its own possibilities . 
  we can not pretend that we can rely on the us for the forseeable future . 
   than maybe europe deserves trump with his fuck-ass america first bullshit . 
  nah , europe deserves a stable future and it deserves to be treated as an equal within todays multipolar world . 
  so , again , please stop being so melodramatic . 
  things change . 
   i realise trade with china is inevitable , but i have no desire to validate their human rights violations by opting for closer ties over those with the usa .
