  in which world is this kind of argumentation acceptable ? 
  i 'm wasting time here again , i hate that . 
  anyway , this shit here is a waste of my time . 
  there is no way in hell that we are going to reach any kind of understanding . 
  i do n't even know what the fuck compelled you to comment on my statement . 
  to be honest , i actually do n't care . 
  spare me your `` truth '' i am not interested . 
  i 'm not going to `` discuss '' this shit with you . 
  there is a 100 % chance that it 's a waste of time ... and i reaaaaaaaaally hate that . 
  i still do n't get it . 
  your question is then :  yet germany is completely okay with america doing one is citizens and head of states ? 
  with what is `` germany '' completely okay ? 
  please read your question and rephrase it . 
  i am seriously trying to find a sense in it but i fail somehow . 
  heat of states , one ? 
  i ca n't decipher what you want to say at all . 
  i guess it is supposed to be a rhetorical question anyway . 
  so you do n't really want an answer . 
  what the fuck does it matter what i `` believe '' ?!, 
  all that matters is what the leaders of the military think . 
  it is normal risk assesment . 
  they wo n't be risking handing out too much info to the turkish army . 
  come on , that is normal procedure . 
  it can be german eyes only , us eyes only etc. . . blabla . 
  every member decides for itself how much intelligence it shares with other parties . 
  the us never shared all their intel with the germans in afghanistan ... for example . 
  it is nothing new and it is standard operating procedure . 
  intel was always like the shiny ring in lotr . 
  no state likes sharing it . 
  also , just take into account how close turkey and russia are at the moment . 
  each nato member will think twice about sharing any kind of intel with turkey right now . 
  it 's common sense , ffs . 
  it 's part of [ `` nato 's forward presence in estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland '' ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_136388.htm ) here 's a nice map : http://www.nato.int//multi/2016/pdf/20161027-enhanced-forward-presence.pdf and a nice video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ulj3tks0zq [ the lithuanian mod says that ] ( http://kam.lt/en/news_1098/current_issues/lithuania_is_prepared_to_host_natos_enhanced_forward_presence_battalion.html?pbck=0 ) : `` the battalion deploying to lithuania will be led and mainly composed by germany 's military personnel with the 122nd mechanised battalion stationed in bavaria . 
  according to g. a\u017eubalis , the nato battalion to be deployed in lithuania is going to comprise tank and ifv maneuver units , heavy artillery , reconnaissance , engineer , and other support units . 
  during different intervals of time tens of tanks and armoured tactical vehicles and several hundreds of wheeled tactical vehicles will be deployed in lithuania : leopard 2 tanks , cv90 armoured personnel carriers , boxer , fennek , etc. '', 
  the troops will `` rotate '' every six months . 
  this way the provisions agreed upon in the [ founding act on mutual relations , cooperation and security between nato and the russian federation signed in paris , france ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_25468.htm?selectedlocale=en ) wo n't be violated . 
  sneaky bastards :-), 
  i actually was pretty sure that the most probable scenario is a guy on a really high ladder . 
  my paint skills are too bad to provide a picture . 
  but i think that it 's plausible . 
   judging by camera angles , the video was shot from a balcony of an apartment building . 
  yeah , no shit sherlock !, 
  stellar reporting right there . 
  bwahaha , i ca n't believe that this shit is actually working . 
  just look at this thread !, 
  people are arguing about how germany is benefitting too much from the euro . 
  then there are those who try to prove that the euro therefore is a bad idea and we do n't need it . 
  and at the bottom people are arguing whether netherlands is worse than germany . 
  lmao . 
  one article in the ft and we start blaming each other , the eu and the euro . 
  good job guys !, 
  mega my ass . 
   glad someone with influence finally put it in the open . 
  oh yeah , thank god . 
  all these years it was hidden behind a cloud of words used by many people and depicitng that the issue is very complex . 
  but now finally a savior arrives using simple words and oversimplifying this complex issue by shifiting all the blame on one country . 
  i am actually impressed that it was n't done through twitter . 
  `` germany big bully of the world !, 
  bad !, 
  we will fight them again !, 
  it is going to be great ! '', 
  it is of course not obvious at all that the divide and conquer strategy is in full swing here . 
  that these idiots start establishing the narative that the eu is just a vehicle for propagating german interests . 
  thank god they finally tell all the `` truth '' we desperately need to hear on this side of the ocean . 
  ha , that 's so nice , i really apreciate your effort here . 
  i find it always very odd how this issue seems to be so extremely fuckin important , as long you can blame refugees , migrants , etc. . . 
  but let 's face it , as soon as the average attention span of the normal reader/user is used up , the issues of domestic violence / sexual harassment ( at work for example ) , so basically all the things that have been problematic for decades and need to be adressed more often , just become `` uninteresting '' again . 
   mystery death xaxaxa , yeah sure , `` mystery '' . 
  i was also a little confused by the `` qualifier '' ancient :-) i looked at the picture and thought : `` is n't this prague ? 
  ancient ? 
  hmmm ... '' but yeah , does n't change the fact that prague is indeed a very nice city . 
  and thanks for clarifying the term `` ancient '', 
  . . ism ? 
  i think the other guy misunderstood your `` question '', 
   uhm , yeah it is . 
  quit being an arsehole . 
  says the douchebag judging people for fun . 
  i am the asshole , sure . 
  i do n't give a shit anymore , you wan na be edgy and cynical , go ahead , look at all the fucks i give . 
  we really have to discuss all the details nao ? 
   television shows , reddit , youtube channels and entire websites are filled with photographs and videos shaming people for stupid , disrespectful , criminal and asocial activity . 
  welcome to germany : we have laws . 
   all they have to do is ask the guy . 
  he said he would take the pics down . 
  he needs the consent of the depicted ** before ** editing the pictures ( which he clearly does ) . 
  the possibility to voice your opinion ** after ** all is done is not sufficient . 
   berliners wag their fingers at each other all day . 
  if you told me to fuck off , i 'd just find a police officer . 
  good luck with that . 
  the police will surely be interested in helping you admonishing a person who told you to fuck off and nothing else . 
  they seriously have better things to do . 
   what does he mean by `` the field '' ? 
  look at the picture you linked before . 
  do you happen to somehow see a `` field '' of steles ?!, 
  coincidentally ? 
   it does n't matter what he thinks . 
  but somehow it matters what you think ? 
  are you that important that your thaughts have to matter more ? 
   the ocean is a place to play , but if someone takes a selfie with an injured dolphin .
