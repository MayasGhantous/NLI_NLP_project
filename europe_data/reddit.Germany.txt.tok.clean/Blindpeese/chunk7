   and that our culture is superior and more ethical in every way . 
  yeah sure , comparing cultures ... it was always such a gud idea , to boil down complex issues to cultural differences . 
  it made finding a solution that much easier ... pathetic . 
   the vast majority of europeans , of the world even hmm ... sure , `` the majority '' , you obviously have good data to back it up ...  in fact most will recognize in `` fact '' ... `` most '' ... you really must know something ...  catholicism in 2017 in general is superior and more humane than islam in `` general '' ... more superior than ...  islam , the most backward and barbaric religion on earth , in every possible way . 
  according to your perception , which is the perception of the `` vast majority '' of the world , right ? 
  i 'd like to see those numbers ...  and i am no fan of catholicism at all . 
  this of course makes you an expert on comparing religions . 
   you can deny this and curse those who admit this plain truth there we go again ... the alt-right mantra of the `` plain truth '' ...  you 're compelled to do so by the politically correct straight-jacket you chose to burden yourself with . 
  but like i said i 'm unburdened and un-bothered . 
  ... and there 's the second part of the mantra : `` i 'm speaking about things which are not pc !, 
  hurdurr , i am a brave citizen who dares speak the only `` truth '' , hurrdurr ! . 
  pathetic . 
   and yes i do admit that those who kill abortion doctors are a million times more ethical and moral than those who massacre civilians indiscriminately . 
  alternative facts ( kellyanne conway ) humane terrorism ( angie )  sorry you find that so offensive . 
  you 're not sorry . 
  quite the contrary . 
  and i am not offended . 
  i am simply showing `` the world '' , that your * opinion * is unhinged , subjective and not based on any kind of factual evidence . 
  people like you are trying to change definitions in order to push their divisive agenda . 
  you simply try to create the classic us vs them narrative . 
  in order to do so , you even start to hypothesize that there is some kind of `` humane terrorism '' . 
  you try to appeal to some kind of logic by insinuating that there is merit in comparing the way people get killed . 
  you try to insinuate that people are more brutal killers , because of their religion . 
  there is absolutely no factual evidence backing up this retarded claim . 
  the mexican drug cartels are at least as creative as isis when it 's about killing people . 
  but it does n't matter at all angie . 
  i am not here to convince you . 
  i am here to show the people reading that you 're a fraud . 
  that there is no `` truth '' in the `` facts '' you 're spreading . 
  that * in fact * you 're lying and trying to be as divisive as possible . 
  you simply use this thread to spread your anti-muslim bullshit , like you always do . 
  the funny fact is , that people using this thread to remind europe that there is still a war ongoing in ukraine are getting torn apart . 
  they get told , that this is not the time and place for such kind of remarks . 
  but people like you , who are using this event to push their islam narrative get all the praise . 
  it shows that there is a lot of work for people like me , who simply will not stand by idly and watch you spreading lies and `` simple truths '' . 
  you are a fraud , your * opinion * is not based on factual evidence , there in no `` humane terrorism '' , the way people get killed is not depending on the religious background of the killer . 
  all you told was bullshit . 
  that 's the one consistency in your line of `` argumentation '' . 
   you provide a lot of whining and complaints about people making insufficient points for somebody who brings zero arguments to the table . 
  i do n't need to . 
  assuming that there is an argument to be made regarding which form of terrorism is more humane , than the other , is pure bullshit . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the brittish victims of ira terrorism are very thankful for their humane bombings ... mental gymnastics ... 
  it 's quite simple : have you ever wrote an essay , or let 's say a proposal at a university ? 
  you start by outlining the topic . 
  you present your question which is in the best case scenario a `` why '' question . 
  this way you invite people to debate an issue . 
  you present your case . 
  you try to make a hypothesis which , in this case , would sound like `` the presence of high ranking officials in a city , increases the chance of terrorist attacks '' . 
  you would research past attacks and show , that there is a case for positing that there is at least correlation between the two events . 
  you would present that data and tell people , that as far as you 're concerned the data seems to validate your assumption . 
  therefore you would like to ask `` europeans '' why this seems to be the case ? 
  i do n't know why you actually need to ask europeans specifically in this case , but , you could use your well-researched proposal for debate to outline , why this is a particularly interesting topic for europeans . 
  you could use more than 3-4 sentences , which automatically would make the case for `` informative '' and almost make the case for `` well-researched '' . 
  and a why question could potentially stimulate a `` healthy discussion '' . 
  you see ? 
  not hard at all . 
  put some effort in it . 
  your `` question '' is actually not a question inviting people to debate . 
  you ask whether it was a coincidence or not ? 
  how the fuck should i know ? 
  i was n't planning on bombing people . 
  your question qualifies for `` simple question '' . 
  those belong to r/askeurope . 
  that 's what r/askeurope is for . 
  asking europe . 
  read the goddamn rules ffs . 
  text posts : we only allow text posts that are informative , well-researched , and stimulate healthy discussion . 
  please use / r/askeurope for simple questions . '', 
   you can be as obtuse as you want . 
  wow such projection much wow ...  that this does n't jive with your bs politically correct worldview does n't interest me in the least . 
  yeah , things not jiving with bs worldviews ... hmm ... such projection much wow ...  idiot leftist like to talk about abortion doctors when people mention isis . 
  that is your prerogative , but it convinces nobody except yourselves . 
  gud projection , jaja . 
  anyway , you somehow , again , did n't manage to make a point without using labels like `` idiot '' and `` leftist '' . 
  good job !, 
  and you 're actually talking about `` convincing '' people . 
  you are a running gag . 
  your point was plain dumb . 
  implying that `` western terrorism '' or `` catholic terrorism '' is more `` humane '' is just pure bullshit . 
  distilled [ bullshit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/on_bullshit ) in its purest form . 
  you even can watch one driving around prague live . 
  i mean most of the day . 
  it does n't drive around that much during the night . 
   and the little they do suffer is often far more humane and less indiscriminate . 
  bwahaha , oh god , mental gymnastics should be an olympic discipline . 
  you would get a 10/10 any time of the day . 
  oh hey guys , look !, 
  there is the not so bad kind of terrorism !, 
  it does n't really matter what i believe . 
  i am inclined to give you the benefit of a doubt , because i do n't know you and it 's not my place to judge . 
  for what it 's worth you might aswell be the nicest guy ever . 
  i do n't know . 
  all i said is , that i * assume * ... i can be gigantically wrong , that 's a very real possibility . 
  i certainly am not envious of your situation and you have my sympathy for being in a bad situation right now . 
  but in my experience these kind of family matters are very complex and in the end pretty devastating for everybody involved . 
  for that you have my sympathy . 
  i hope you and your ex-wife get it all sorted out eventually . 
  nah , it 's an issue for you obviously , at least when i read your other comments . 
  i also would n't call it a mess . 
  and yeah , if the kids are born in germany , they stay in germany .
