  besides the things that are already done or on their way to be done . 
  here in germany i see it everyday by now . 
  we get stricter laws or they get interpreted in a stricter way . 
  there is a live and open debate in society and in the media . 
  the first persons who actually talked about the problems were women who tried to help the refugees and said that there is obviously a big problem regarding the integration of those people . 
  we have been dicussing this shit ad nausea for more than a year now , and this subreddit has n't made any kind of progress . 
  on the contrary , every time again and again we reiterate the same shit by now and marvel in our stupid fame points . 
  there is no discussion anymore . 
  because it is n't the answer he expected . 
  please try to make a point against refugees . 
  enjoy the upvotes afterwards . 
  we needed 5000 police officers to secure the visit of the us president in berlin . 
  that shit actually never changes . 
  it only got worse year after year . 
  i am pretty sure that donald will require even more than that . 
  anyways , the thing with the immigration etc. 
  can actually be handled and the numbers will get better again . 
  us presidents just keep on fuckin up again and again . 
  but we got used to that ... hence the 5000 officers last time ... 
   just be happy they 're willing to listen to reality for once instead of saying `` that 's racist ! '', 
  there is already a discussion about the use of the term `` nafri '' used by the authorities . 
  so we still have the `` that 's racist '' discussion . 
  which is ok , because that 's how open debates work in our societies . 
  for the rest : holy shit !, 
  you mean that `` they '' actually do their job whoever `` they '' are supposed to be . 
  you mean that politicians , authorities , etc are actually working for their money and that we can actually see results ? 
  this is so unexpected , wait , not really . 
  it 's a normal process . 
  events and new information actually change the view of people who decide what to do . 
  it takes time but it happens quite often actually . 
  media people are somehow too freakin lazy or stupid to get their facts strait . 
  here are the numbers i managed to gather from our news outlets : i do n't know why ( could n't get any info on how they managed to get that number ) but the local authorities were talking about a group of almost 2000 people . 
  these persons were on their way to cologne ... to obviously have a party or whatever . 
  they were travelling in smaller groups . 
  i 'm stating this shit only because the formulations in the german media are kinda murky . 
  i guess the authorities were keeping track of travellers to cologne and estimated that about 2000 of them could mean trouble . 
  so , of the almost 2000 : 650 were screened ( id checks , passports , documents , etc. ), 
  because according to the police they were expressing an aggresive attitude ( whatever that means ) . 
  98 % of the 650 were of north african origins . 
  190 persons got a so called `` platzverweis '' . 
  this means that the police told them to get lost and that they are n't allowed to be there ( on the place in front of the k\u00f6lner dom ) . 
  however this means that they could legally go and party anywhere else in cologne . 
  92 persons were actually detained . 
  27 persons were arrested . 
  ( note : there is a legal difference betweed detained and arrested . 
  an arrest will have legal consequences . 
  detained persons are able to fuck off after the dangerous situation which had to be avoided through detaining them has been averted ) . 
  10 sexual offenses have been registered . 
  no raping . 
  so this article prompted the expected response in the comments . 
  the blaming of bbc , pakistanis and even muslims started and nobody wants to contribute any further information . 
  so i 'll have to do it myself i guess , here we go : tackling child sexual exploitation , hm government , march 2015 : https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408604/2903652_rotherhamresponse_acc2.pdf page 6 : `` people who abuse children must be stopped . 
  their race , age or gender is irrelevant . 
  in rotherham , the majority of the known perpetrators were of pakistani heritage -- but misplaced concerns about political correctness stopped any proper action being taken . 
  this is not acceptable . 
  we can not allow professionals to avoid tackling the sexual abuse of children by members of ethnic minority communities for fear of being seen as racist . 
  child sexual exploitation is not exclusive to any single community , race or religion . 
  there is no culture in which sexual abuse is not a serious crime . '', 
  so obviously the pakistany sentiment is not completely unfounded . 
  are asians disproportionately represented in prosecutions for sex offences ? 
  https://fullfact.org/news/are-asians-disproportionately-represented-prosecutions-sex-offences/#anchor it 's an older article but it has some further information regarding the topic . 
  here is a part of the conclusion as a tl ; dr : `` while both the hm prison service and ceop datasets have problems associated with them , there is nevertheless some evidence to suggest that sex offenders are ` overwhelmingly white ' in terms of the raw numbers . 
  however while just under 82 per cent of inmates incarcerated for sex offences in 2007 were classified as white , this was actually lower than the overall proportion of the population that were similarly classed , which stands at 87.5 per cent ( for england ) . 
  at six per cent , the proportion of sex offenders in custody that were classed as asian almost exactly matches the proportion of the population classed similarly . 
  looking at grooming offences collected by the ceop , while the white ethnic group makes up the largest proprotion of all offenders , it is far below the proportion of white people in the general population . 
  meanwhile , those of asian origin are indeed disproportionately represented here . '', 
  about `` asians '' : the fact that many articles and reports use the term asians is caused by the definition used by the ons itself . 
  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/480250/bulletin.pdf page 97 : `` mapping of different ethnicity categorisations '' they use `` white , black , asian , mixed , chinese or other and not stated '' . 
  asian includes bangladeshi , indian , pakistani , other . 
  therefore official reports and documents often just use asian . 
  most statistics i checked adhere to these definitions . 
  so there is no `` language policy '' it 's statistics . 
  about child sexual exploitation : interesting read regarding the problems of gathering meningful data and compiling statistics about cse : https://www.coe.int/t/dg3/children/1in5/source/publicationsexualviolence/lalor-mcelvaney.pdf also an interesting read about cse in europe : http://www.ecpat.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/regional%20csec%20overview_europe.pdf page 12-13 : `` in some european countries , child domestic trafficking for sexual purposes has been reported to be growing and to have become increasingly complex . 
  in the uk , for example , a recent report by the children 's charity barnardo 's warned that the trafficking of british children around uk cities for sexual exploitation is rising , with the average age of victims falling from 15 to about 13 over five years . 
  grooming methods have also become more sophisticated as abusers now use a range of technology -- mobile phones , including texts and picture message ; ... the `` inappropriate relationship '' usually involves an older abuser with control over a child . 
  known also as the `` lover-boy '' phenomenon , this method was first identified in the netherlands and is now being detected and reported in other european countries , including austria and ireland . 
  in the netherlands , changes in how `` lover - boys '' operate have been noted recently , with an increasing use of blackmail and violence against the girls and some victims being used to recruit new girls ( these girls are called `` lover-girls '' ) . '', 
  you can read the rest yourself . 
  it 's quite interesting . 
  so boys and girls , here you have some information which maybe will actually help you to get an informed opinion . 
  edit : some minor editing stuff and spelling . 
   an `` artform '' ... `` knowyourmeme '' i see what you did there ^ ^, 
  nah , bild is fortunately not as freakin crazy as the uk tabloids . 
  that 's why i `` recommended '' it . 
  it is obviously not `` quality journalism '' in a sense that it features mostly very short articles with many pictures , but it is nevertheless a quite significant part of the german media landscape . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say ... you `` sound '' kinda incoherent but i guess not leaving your basement for days and growing a beard on your neck gets you that result . 
  ... hey , just like russia !, 
  i guess the times did n't change that much , heh ? 
  i 'm gon na jump on this one to hijack the german part a little :-) www.spiegel.de ( derspiegel ) has experienced a decline in quality but is still nice if you want to get a quick overview of the hot topics of the day . 
  www.zeit.de ( diezeit ) is like he said kinda self absorbed but i would still call it a good paper . 
  also they have a nice bar on the right showing the top 3 viewed/commented/shared articles . 
  reading the comments can be fun , you can get a nice glimpse of the german way to circlejerk a topic to death . 
  i also would recommend www.sz.de ( s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung ) ( it forces you to deactivate your adblocker btw ) . 
  it is pretty good . 
  www.welt.de ( diewelt ) is like faz rather right leaning . 
  but do n't get spooked , right and left leaning does n't mean that much in germany . 
  there is a certain mainstream . 
  and of course if you want to catch a glimpse of the tabloid sphere : www.bild.de ( bild ) . 
  they are fuckin cancer but i have to admit that they get stories fast and also manage to influence the public perception . 
  therefore i would n't ignore them .
