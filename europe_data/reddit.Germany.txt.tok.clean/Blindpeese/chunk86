  people around here react in a certain way towards patriotism , because it hurt the country quite a lot . 
  it led to some outcomes , which are still visible today . 
  just take a walk through berlin and you realize what patriotism followed by nationalism brought this country . 
  it 's been only 26 years since the reunification . 
  people still know very well , that this country was divided . 
  that it was occupied by foreign forces . 
  it is the experience of a few decades worth of history under foreign `` paternalism '' , which makes us wary of people crying for more patriotism . 
  it 's actually quite the contrary to the common belief , that gets described here a lot . 
  we germans are very proud of this country and of the fact that we managed to get along with the rest of the world for quite a while now . 
  the german passport gets you everywhere now . 
  but yeah , many people , me included , react very deprecating towards people calling for some kind of naive unreflected patriotism . 
  we simply learned that there are better ways to achieve progress . 
  through cooperation for example . 
  patriotism has n't brought us anything but a world of pain . 
  i am proud of this country , but unreflected flag waving patriotism is not the way to go . 
   always a fun time when germans come here to lecture people about how right-wing and conservative the cdu & merkel supposedly are i mean , come on , we 're living in the same country after all ... i think it gives us germans a certain level of insight . 
   while the latter are practicing quasi open `` quasi open '' implies that even you do n't really believe what you 're writing and actually are n't sure whether they 're practicing open border policies or not . 
   as everyone knows aaah , the best argument ever , reddit 's favorite : * everybody knows * ...  regarding some policies germany is so far left on the spectrum nowadays compared to which country ? 
  great , you made me actually look up the statistics to see what 's up . 
  and now you made me compile a fuckin table myself in order to provide a more complete picture . 
  so [ here 's ] ( https://www.bka.de/de/aktuelleinformationen/statistikenlagebilder/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/pks2016/standardtabellen/standardtabellentatverdaechtige.html;jsessionid=acc163153fabbb8421bff10694c39de3.live0602?nn=65720 ) the source : it 's actually mentioned in the pic ... 
  tables 61 +62 ( scroll down the page , it 's the last two tables ) . 
  from those tables : table 61 is listing the non-german suspects . 
  from there `` straftaten gegen die sexuelle selbstbestimmung '' ( this is sexual harassment ) where the suspects are male . 
  it 's line 61 in the excel spreadsheet : the columns following the legaly in germany are a breakdown of the legaly in germany column . 
  sexual harassment | suspects total | non-germans | illegaly in germany | legaly in germany | members of armed forces | tourists | students/pupils | employees | trader | asylum-seeker | `` rest '' | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- numbers | 31.522 | 8.221 | 117 | 8.104 | 34 | 103 | 335 | 960 | 72 | 2.804 | 3.796 | so this is one stat out of a few regarding sexual harrasment and rape . 
  you can scroll through the rest yourself . 
  there are two points to take away here . 
  germans are still kinda bad ( who would 've thought ) . 
  and yes , asylum seekers and the `` rest '' ( rest actually means sonstiger erlaubter aufenthalt , meaning different kind of residency permit ... to be honest , i 'm not sure what it really is , i guess `` subsidiary '' refugees can be counted here , too ) make up the majority of * suspects * in the group of non-german suspects . 
  from table 62 : sexual harassment | suspects total | non-germans | germans | algeria | gambia | afg | somalia | lebanon | iran | tunisia | marocco | nigeria | albania | romania | turkey | bosnia | bulgaria | greece | croatia | poland | hungary | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- | : -- numbers | 33.533 | 8.698 | 24.835 | 148 | 64 | 838 | 90 | 107 | 236 | 78 | 171 | 108 | 108 | 449 | 1066 | 101 | 309 | 140 | 93 | 316 | 85 | there you go . 
  i do n't know how the guy who made the graph in the first place actually compiled all the numbers into one neat number . 
  the differences between the two totals come from the fact that the total number in the first table is the number of male suspects only . 
  ~ ~ to be honest , the graph is fishy as fuck . 
  it 's suspect per 100k population ... 
  i do n't know how he got to those numbers . 
  it obviously must be some kind of relations , but i do n't have a clue which numbers that guy has put into relation to which numbers . 
  turks are leading this list quite significantly with 1066 , but in the original list they 're pretty low ... ~ ~ ~ ~ i guess the explanation would be , that there are more turks , than people from gambia ( for example ) but i do n't know from where op took his base numbers . ~ ~ anyway , if you actually want to look up the unfiltered numbers , follow the links and have fun with the excel spreadsheets . 
  ** well edit : ** some people linked to the stats here https://www.destatis.de/de/publikationen/thematisch/bevoelkerung/migrationintegration/auslaendbevoelkerung2010200167004.pdf?__blob=publicationfile i crosschecked a few of those numbers and calculated the ratios and so far the numbers for the single states check out . 
  you can disagree on using ratios , etc , i do n't have an opinion regarding that particular issue right now . 
  but the numbers presented in the graph are at least calculated correctly . 
  so yeah , these stats will need to be taken into account in the future discussion and obviously there 's a lot of work to be done . 
  the numbers are pretty ugly ... 
  sure , as long as it 's not about gas from russia ... then it 's everybody for himself :-), 
  ... hmmm ... and this is bad how ? 
  you still have my vote :-), 
  you should become a mod . 
  i 'd vote for you . 
  no , seriously !, 
  i mean it . 
  that 's cool . 
  anyways ... your username is kinda `` interesting '' . 
  are those 2 ii ? 
  or il ?!, 
  is it a joke ?!, 
  you know like 2nd heaven but with a `` th '' ? 
  or what 's an ilth ? 
  or iith ? 
  fuck me , this username doe !, 
   everybody * le * sigh ... welcome to reddit , the place where * everybody * knows what * everybody * does and thinks , always . 
  thanks for your input . 
  i appreciate it / s to be completely frank here , this discussion has reached its end about 2 hours ago for me . 
  i had a fun and interesting conversation with another dude here and i enjoyed it . 
  these last few comments , especially your freudian analysis ( i guess you studied psychology , or something ... creative ?! ), 
  are like background noise . 
  they always plop up hours after all has been said and i really dgaf at this point . 
  i moved on to watching streams on twitch ... 
  i do that quite often during the evening after i put my kid to bed . 
  i 'm too tired to play myself , so i watch this bearded guy shooting tanks . 
  it 's actually fun . 
  and then the mail thingy ( i use res ) plops up and i 'm like : `` hmmm , a new comment ?!, 
  really ?!, 
  now ?!, 
  ok let 's read it ... 
  i can toy around with it for a little while '' let 's do something creative with it . 
  let 's simply change the topic . 
  so how was your day ? 
  do you sometimes ask yourself , why the fuck did you actually not ignore a shitty comment in the first place ?!, 
  i do . 
  i actually ignore a lot of shitty comments , but sometimes they reach a level of bullshittery , which triggers me . 
  you 're right about that . 
  it makes me sound passive-aggressive ( although i 'm not sure why , because i am actually pretty openly agressive and calling people out for their bullshittery , so i do n't get what 's passive about it ) , because i 'm so annoyed reading comments which are pure [ bullshit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/on_bullshit ) : `` frankfurt determines that bullshit is speech intended to persuade ( a.k.a. 
  rhetoric ) , without regard for truth . '', 
  you know , i actually care about things and sometimes those things get me riled up . 
  when people state things , which simply are n't true , but they clearly imply that they are factually right about those things , it simply grinds my gears . 
  i care about this sub and when i see the amount of bullshit that gets peddled here , it triggers me . 
  we cry about fake news , dishonest politicians , the technocrats in the eu but we let all the bullshit in the comments slide by and do n't bat an eye ... it gets upvoted . 
  people come here to defend a person , who was clearly bullshitting around . 
  it 's disappointing . 
  but yeah anyways ... how was your day ? 
  mine was mediocre . 
  although , the weather is finally fine around here . 
  i 'll enjoy the rest of my evening nao and watch this bearded dude shoot tanks . 
  have a pleasant week , stranger on the internet . 
  edit :  everybody who studies medicine or is a doctor will tell you how `` creative '' that job is ( spoiler : it is n't ) . 
  i guess you have n't read my other comments :-), 
  sure , because all the engineers are creating new machines every day . 
  i can live with that . 
  i actually endorse this view full-heartedly and therefore expect you to judge the initial comment by the same standard . 
  i agree with you .
