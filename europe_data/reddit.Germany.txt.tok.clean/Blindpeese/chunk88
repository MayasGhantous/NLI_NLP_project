  it would n't help the situation right now . 
  most of us are waiting for merkel to persuade the n. africa states to cooperate . 
  it simply takes time . 
  also , the situation in turkey is showing quite well , what to expect , when dealing with those kinds of states . 
  every new treaty , or partnership programme , is quite fragile . 
  it 's about refugees and merkel . 
  wait till t_d wakes up and starts upvoting this thread . 
  it will be such fun / s. ... 
   they also do n't provide stats about the newborn https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesellschaftstaat/bevoelkerung/geburten/tabellen/lebendgeborenestaatsangehoerigkeitlaender.html you can sum it up yourself . 
   and yeah its from 2015 of course it is . 
  the 2016 data has n't been published yet . 
  it takes time to compile all the numbers . 
  here you go : source is the statistics bureau of berlin and brandenburg : https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/ they have an online database : https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/webapi/jsf/tableview/tableview.xhtml you can fill and empty the rows any way you want ... 
  the 2016 census has n't been published yet . 
  year | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | : - | : - | : - | : - | : - | : - | : - | : - | : - | : - | : - | : - german kids | 26.923 | 27.561 | 28.342 | 28.833 | 28.660 | 29.781 | 29.483 | 31.343 | 31.183 | 33.253 | 33.197 | foreign kids | 2.053 | 2.066 | 2.832 | 3.103 | 3.444 | 3.612 | 3.592 | 3.335 | 3.855 | 4.115 | 4.833 | percentage | 7,6 % | 7,4 % | 9,9 % | 10,7 % | 12 % | 12,1 % | 12,1 % | 10,6 % | 12,3 % | 12,3 % | 14,5 % | so yeah , there 's an obvious increase in kids without german citizenship . 
  the migration background of the kids is n't published . 
  if you 're interested in the background of the people you get the newest data in english here : https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/produkte/kleinestatistik/ap_kleinestatistik_en_2016_be.pdf it 's on pages 11 +12 . 
  spolier alert : the majority of foreigners is from the europe + turkey . 
  and here 's the latest update , in german : https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/pms/2017/17-07-12.pdf saying , that there are significantly more foreigners in berlin now , compared to last year , there is an increase of 9,6 % . 
  in total there are 628000 . 
  110000 are persons looking for asylum . 
  20 % of them are from syria , 11 % are of `` unknown origin '' ( i.e. 
  no docs ) and 10 % are from afghanistan . 
  those are the 3 biggest groups . 
  the origin of the rest is n't mentioned . 
  i hope that satisfies your couriosity . 
   we have amazing heritage of architecture and art in europe to enjoy today precisely because of rich people who lived in the cities and invested in it as part of a culture which valued it . 
  not really , we have all those centres , because institutionalized and organized states became the norm and , because societies decided to keep some of the buildings as part of a national heritage . 
  we , the tax payers are paying for the upkeep of many of those buildings . 
  i 'm totally ok with that , many of our museums and our oldest university are located in buildings , which actually were palaces , etc. 
  the german historical museum in berlin is in the old armory of the prussian king . 
  i simply want to point out , that maybe `` rich '' people ( most of the time , they were n't rich , they just simply took a lot of debt to build all those things ) were responsible for the building process , but modern societies are now responsible for the upkeep . 
  and yes , that 's why many `` old '' buildings in the east are run down , because the socialist/communist parties did n't want to pay for the upkeep of the old houses belonging to the nobility . 
  we can see it here in east-berlin aswell . 
  the royal palace is being rebuilt right now , because the original was torn down by the gdr socialist party . 
  you have a very romantic view of those times to be frank . 
  the word associated with these `` beautiful '' buildings in berlin during those specific times is `` mietskaserne '' ( rental barracks ) . 
  people lived under seriously shitty conditions . 
  the modern style , also found in the bauhaus style developed during those times was partly influenced by the wish to provide homes for the people , where they actually would have liked to live . 
  the houses in these pictures and movies did n't have any real amenities . 
  showers , toilets , etc. 
  families of 4 to 5 persons lived in one single room . 
   when western civilization was still alive and vibrant , non-ashamed to value itself , cities were built to be beautiful and stand the test of time . 
  and sorry dude , but this statement is such bullshit . 
  the `` beautiful '' parts of berlin were built by rich people . 
  the wilhelmstra\u00dfe for example , was a planned street and the king of prussia made it clear , that only the honorous and rich officers and people of the nobility were supposed to build their palaces there . 
  it was not a common goal of the `` people '' to build a beautiful city . 
  rich guys simply spent a shitload of money on their houses , while the normal people lived in shitty tenements . 
  and it was intended to show off the supremacy of the prussian style . 
  there was no `` western civilization '' . 
  especially the germans made it a point to distance themselves from the barbaric french people . 
  again , you have a very skewed and romantic view of those times . 
  i am glad , that i do n't have to live in those houses . 
   it looks sensibly ok , it 's settled then ...  what we know ... who is we ? 
   we ca n't count the number of victims by simple generalization who did that ? 
   you are just being petty absolutely wanting that nice badge of the worst single crime since ww2 come on , he does n't really come over that way to me . 
  i do n't know , why you have to sound as hostile as you do here . 
   you 're just doing unhistoric virtue signaling ... not white knights . 
  seriously , this kind of bashing is totally uncalled for , at this stage of the discussion . 
  ah come on , he made me lough out loud :-) i 'm actually still smiling while trying to picture our political class as a bunch of altruists ... hmm ... sure , they are so fuckin altruistic it really hurts ... the greek for example . 
  i want to be precise . 
  you 're spreading fake news obviously . 
  telling people , that the eu actually sanctioned poland . 
  the eu opened an infringement case , to be precise : the commission . 
  the list i provided shows that it is common practice and that opening infringement cases is a mechanism used to enforce rules of the eu . 
  what the list also shows is , that many countries rather chose to take the case to the european court and to fight it out there . 
  it therefore shows , that the commission is pretty much hoping , that the case will go the way it wants it to go . 
  but there is no guarantee . 
  the court might as well decide in favor of poland , hungary , etc. 
  it is a court after all and not a political organ . 
  i simply feel the need to inform you about procedures within the eu framework , because you obviously lack the needed knowledge . 
  an infringement procedure is not a sanction . 
  the media likes to name it that way , because it sells well . 
  but it 's not the first time , that the eu opened an infringement procedure against poland and it 's not going to be the last time . 
  and the ee countries , just like germany and france , use the european court decisions to influence the policies of the eu . 
  it 's a standard bargaining process between the commission and the member states . 
  infringement procedures are a part of the game . 
  yes , i actually did . 
  so when did poland got sanctioned ? 
  are there any sanctions against poland in place right now ? 
  to cite from your `` well written '' article : `` brussels will sanction czech republic , poland and hungary for refusing to take part in a controversial scheme to share out refugees across the bloc ... ... as a result , the european commission ** launched infringement proceedings ** -- a long-winded process of sanction that could ultimately lead to fines '' let 's see : https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/infringements/general-information_en infringement procedure where it detects a failure to comply with community law , the commission may initiate the procedure for failure to fulfil an obligation provided for in article 258 of the tfeu ( see page 210 ) . 
  in the first stage of the procedure , the commission sends the member state a letter of formal notice inviting it to submit its observations within two months . 
  this exchange of views is not normally publicised . 
  where the observations submitted by the member state fail to persuade the commission to change its point of view or where the member state fails to respond to the request , the commission may issue a reasoned opinion , allowing the member state an additional two-month period within which to comply . 
  at this stage the commission issues a press release informing the eu 's citizens of the purpose of the procedure . 
  if the member state fails to conform with community law , the commission can take the case to the court of justice , whose judgment is binding . 
  if the member state fails to comply with court 's judgment , the commission may , after sending a further letter of formal notice and reasoned opinion , bring the matter before the court of justice a second time , seeking the imposition of a penalty payment under article 260 of the tfeu ( see page 211 ) . 
  so , i 'll ask once again for clarification : when did poland got sanctioned ? 
  are the sanctions against poland in place right now ? 
  because following this list : http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/law/press_en.htm , the eu has obviously `` sanctioned '' pretty much every eu country by now , even germany , italy , etc. . . 
  when did poland got sanctioned ? 
  sure , sure ... you also seem to have all the good arguments on your side / s :-), 
  such a gud answer ... / s your girlfriend must be proud :-), 
  so whose alt-account are you ? 
  i guess i managed to hurt your feelings in an other thread . 
  you obviously skimmed through my comments looking for something , because why the hell would you actually bring up this obscure and old thread ? 
  i am actually flattered . 
  you 're funny m8 ... you know , like a clown :-), 
  aaaaaaw , so you 're not a part of a `` silent majority '' ?!, 
  ... that sucks / s,
