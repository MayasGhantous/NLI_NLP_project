   so why are n't they included in this graph ? 
  op stated several times in this thread , that he did n't want to overcomplicate the issue . 
  as far as i get it , this thread is a reaction to the comments in the g20 riots threads we had yesterday , where most people were getting the impression that left-wing `` terrorism '' and crimes are at an absolute high , or something and of course way worse , than right-wing offenses . 
  so the topic was intended to present statistics about left vs. right crimes . 
  the thread was not inteded to discuss crimes influenced by foreign ideologies . 
  but it 's r/europe after all and i guess it would n't be a good thread without the usual islamist terrorism is going to destroy the world innuendo . 
   however , i doubt that a dutch person drawing a swastika would get counted as ` foreign ' rather than ` right-wing ' . 
  11 % of germans are not ethnically from current eu member states , and 7.8 % are not ethnically european . 
  pmak is not defined by the origin of the perpetrator , but by the ideology . 
  therefore even germans can fall under pmak . 
  a german citizen who decided to join the is and to blow up things in the name of the is would be counted as pmak ... the blowing up to be precise . 
  http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/019/1701928.pdf it 's on page 5 ... it 's in german . 
  aaaaaaaw , i 'm touched . 
   it seems that political violence from neither the left or the right receive too much international attention . 
  because it does n't sell papers and it 's not cool enough for breaking news . 
   i 'm curious what exactly those crimes were . 
  here 's the [ summary ] ( https://www.bka.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/publikationen/jahresberichteundlagebilder/kriminalitaetimkontextvonzuwanderung/kriminalitaetimkontextvonzuwanderung_2016.pdf?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=3 ) , it 's in german . 
  page 42 has the info for you . 
  you 'll need to translate it yourself , i 'm too lazy . 
  spoiler alert : it 's about kurdish pkk stuff and is terrorism of course . 
   a right winger never set fire to my car and never killed my favorite politician so that might be why i 'm a bit biased . 
  yeah , they just set refugee shelters on fire and homeless people . 
  i get why you 're biased ... 
  no , you did n't . 
  it 's coded as pmak ( ( politisch-motivierte-ausl\u00e4nder-kriminalit\u00e4t - politically motivated foreigner crime ) . 
  it is its own category ... bummer . 
  are you disappointed now , did i get it right ? 
   no word to support those man who risks their lives to keep leftties asses safe you seem quite angry . 
  anyway . 
  you really ca n't manage to say how i implied that blinding pilots is ok . also you seem not able to answer how i implied that violence against the police is ok . 
  the fact that i would feel uneasy with so many police forces around me , does n't mean , that i am against the police and , that i do n't support them . 
  you simply assume things . 
  and yeah , the g20 summit is a retarded shitshow . 
  it costs tons of money , downtown hamburg is on lock-down , people ca n't live their lives the way they want and we get a ton of people from the rest of the world , who simply come here to stirr up some shit . 
  hence my proposal to do the summit in somalia the next time . 
  so yeah , please spare me your assumptions . 
  and yeah , please excuse the fact , that i do n't like it , when 20000 police officers occupy the downtown area of a single city . 
  yeah , that shit is dystopian . 
  still did n't answer my question ... you know , the one about blinding pilots . 
  just try it . 
  answer my question . 
  it should be simple actually . 
  why ca n't you answer it ? 
  still did n't answer my question . 
   it does n't make me uneasy though . 
  yeah well , it makes me uneasy though , m8 . 
  so what now ? 
  how does this work , all this * opinions * stuff ... i guess my opinion does n't count then . 
  20k police officers in full gear with mps and shit make me feel slightly uneasy . 
  as a private citizen i would keep away from those places . 
  and the fact , that we actually need 20k police plus helicopters , drones and state of the art surveillance to `` protect '' our `` world leaders '' ... now that makes me think . 
  i really do n't get this shit anymore . 
  the next summit should take place in somalia , sudan , egypt , etc. 
  or beijing , i do n't care . 
  like i said , i 'm glad that berlin dodged this particular bullet . 
  o boy , you answer me first : how did you come to the conclusion that i am ok with people blinding pilots ? 
  i wrote something about 20k police in hamburg and you came up with blinding pilots . 
  that 's why i 'm laughing my ass off . 
  because you do n't make sense . 
  logic , do you have it ? 
   and what is standard for you ? 
  blinding copter 's pilot with laser ? 
  i you aware from where this particular practice came ? 
  how did you come to this particular conclusion ? 
  logic , do you have it ? 
   more than 20,000 police , many heavily armed , are patrolling the streets , backed up by drones and the latest surveillance technology . 
  helicopters are permanently `` parked '' in the clouds yep , to be honest ... that sounds like a nightmare . 
  i am really glad that berlin dodged this retarded shitshow this time . 
  the presence of police is fine ... the presence of 20k police officers , heavily armed with drones ... nope , please no , that 's the stuff that makes me feel kinda uneasy . 
  maybe it 's standard for the us . 
  but not for us . 
  this is going to leave the `` fuck germany those stupid ns2 traitors '' crowd kinda confused i guess . 
  how to deal with this ? 
  someone tell me !, 
  i mean it 's the v4 ... they 're all strong allies ... hungary , wtf ? 
  y u do dis ? 
  it 's a rather loose concept , at least one can argue whether it makes sense or not , but anyhow here 's your answer : `` q. 
  how does the weo categorize advanced versus emerging market and developing economies ? 
  the main criteria used by the weo to classify the world into advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies are ( 1 ) per capita income level , ( 2 ) export diversification -- so oil exporters that have high per capita gdp would not make the advanced classification because around 70 % of its exports are oil , and ( 3 ) degree of integration into the global financial system . 
  in the first criteria , we look at an average over a number of years given that volatility ( due to say oil production ) can have a marked year-to-year effect . 
  for the first criterion , the data source is the weo database ; for the second criterion , it is the un comtrade database ; and for the last criterion , it is the imf 's balance of payments statistics database . 
  note , however , that these are not the only factors considered in deciding the classification of countries . 
  as it says in the weo statistical appendix , `` this classification is not based on strict criteria , economic or otherwise , and it has evolved over time . 
  the objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful method of organizing data . '', 
  reclassification only happens when something marked changes or the case for change in terms of the three criteria above becomes overwhelming . 
  for example , lithuania joining the euro area was a significant change in circumstances that warranted a reclassification from an emerging market and developing economy to an advanced economy . 
  most reclassifications in recent years were related to countries joining the euro area . '',

  the 30 advanced economies are : australia , austria , belgium , canada , cyprus , denmark , finland , france , germany , greece , hong kong sar , iceland , ireland , israel , italy , japan , korea , luxembourg , malta , netherlands new zealand , norway , portugal , singapore , slovenia , spain , sweden , switzerland , the united kingdom , and the united states .

  just google it yourself ... hahahahahahaha, 
  it was teamviewer and i do n't really know what happened and i actually did n't keep up with the news at all . 
  but like i said to the other guy , for me the time saving is still worth `` it '' . 
  i do n't know what `` it '' is in this case . 
  i mean , if they 're spying on me helping my mom with her pc problems , then , well , whatever , i guess :-) besides that , i run the usual programms to keep my computer as free as possible of malware etc. 
  but if the cia , gru , fsb etc really want to hack this piece of shit , then i would n't be able to do anything against it anyway . 
  brave new world ... 
  yeah i know , i still use it . 
  even the company i work for still uses it . 
  like i said , there 's no need to install anything so i simply run the programme for 3-5 minutes .
