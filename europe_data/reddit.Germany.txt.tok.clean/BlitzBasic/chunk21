  literally no medical authority considers homosexuality a mental illness . 
  the person how allegedly said `` then let them eat cake '' was french , not german . 
  you already got two of them two hours ago . 
  did you read them ? 
  you could just go through the links in the [ wikipedia-article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporal_punishment_in_the_home#effects_on_behaviour_and_development ) , for example . 
  which side do you refer to ? 
  you 're a pretty shitty role model in that case . 
  i 'll gift you a full set : \u00f6\u00e4\u00fc\u00d6\u00c4\u00dc do n't use them all at once , who knows when you 'll get more . 
  those poor peasants ca n't afford our glorious german letter . 
  i do n't think there is a crime called `` hate speech '' in germany . 
  the most similar would probably be `` volksverhetzung '' , which is more like `` inflammatory speech '' . 
  becoming a part of germany is always a step forward !, 
   economy did n't declide since 1992  `` last couple of years '' does n't checks out . 
  oh , you 're one of those `` all germans are nazis '' - guys ? 
  i should n't have wasted my time responding to you . 
  it 's called sarcasm , dear friend . 
  it 's from the same song , the `` lied der deutschen '' . 
  the anthem itself is only the third stanza of this song . 
  so , people that dislike erdogan exist ? 
  also in breaking news : water is wet !, 
  hey , i wanted to make that joke !, 
  not fair !, 
   oh look , another country got a new president without a year long campaign , a first round , a revoked second round , a failed attempt , finally a second round , and without costs of millions of euros . 
  insert a funny `` germans are efficient '' joke here . 
  i prefer ops picture , thank you very much . 
  that 's unfortunatly ( or fortunatly ? 
  i do n't know ) true . 
  that was quite some time ago . 
  we changed . 
  that 's a thing that happens , you know ? 
  just because you once did something bad does n't means you stay bad for the rest of your existance . 
  care to explain ? 
  / r/europe is not representative of europeans in general . 
  gay people are n't , but equal rights for gay people are . 
  i mean , it 's technically correct ... 
  thank you !, 
  what does `` stvxw '' and `` sahm '' mean ? 
  well , there is still a big difference between `` we want gay marriage '' and `` we hate trump '' . 
  those two things do n't require each other . 
  well , there is always a chance to die a stupid and unpredictable death ... 
  yeah , but the `` marvelous system '' sucks . 
  with every non-stupid election system clinton would have won the election . 
  yeah , and the consitution is stupid . 
  if you take votes away form one canidate the other canidate wins the election ? 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  god , tag that shit nsfl . 
  what `` legitimate arguments '' are there agains allowing gay couples to adopt children ? 
  you do n't have a fucking say in anything . 
  directly or indirectly elected politicians make the decisions , thats how a representative democracy works . 
  that 's how both your country and the eu work . 
  which country would that be ? 
  everybody says so, 
  i 'm aware . 
  but that 's not the reason that practice was allowed in germany a few years ago . 
  most german protestants do n't do this . 
  the main reason that convinced our politicians to allow male circumcision was muslim and jewish groups pushing for it . 
  even the pixelated face is clearly not white . 
  it 's still brown , even if not as dark as his face actually is . 
  and no , it does n't makes it easier to draw conclusions . 
  if they bring the face of every criminal to the same tone , it 's impossible to tell from the picture what he color he actually has . 
   social engineering , in this case through manipulation of data and news . 
  well , that 's just baseless accuations . 
  i do n't want to say that it 's the fault of the jews , but ... it 's totally the fault of the jews . 
  i do n't see the problem with the pixelation . 
  you literally pixelate faces to make it impossible to draw conclusions about the identity of the person who 's face got pixelated . 
  making it harder to see the skin color fits that exact purpose . 
  [ sigmar gabriel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigmar_gabriel ) , former leader of the spd , current minister for foreign affairs and vice chancellor . 
  i stopped questioning the way language works a long time ago . 
  it just does . 
  that 's all i need to know . 
  that sounds a bit strange with the `` man '' - syllable two times directly successively . 
   we can not detain them indefinitely . 
  says who ? 
  i like you . 
  well , but you speak out a lot against germany . 
  just because your complaints are justifed does n't mean that you did n't made a deliberate decision to criticise germany instead of one of the other countries that do questionable stuff . 
  or `` go to war , we need to bomb some guys on the other side of the world '', 
  so you honestly want to tell us that there was no intermarriage between natives and white americans ? 
  i 'm afraid that 's not how the rechtsstaat works . 
  can ? 
  surely . 
  is it probable ? 
  but it 's at least possible . 
  it 's in the article , not in the video . 
  germany , europe , world ... a few years from now there wo n't be a difference between those words anyways kappa . 
  there are like two fully anti-immigration partys in germany , the npd ( basically nazis ) and the afd ( also basically nazis ) . 
  which means translated `` i fear i 'll loose my conservative voters '', 
  well , the germans were bad . 
  just because somebody killed more people does n't excuses the nazis . 
  the central council of the jews is angry !, 
  execpt germany would in a war still be worth more than greece and poland . 
  well , they did n't really fight in ww2 . 
  it 's not forbidden to remove the foreskin of the human penis , but it 's forbidden to remove parts of the external female genitalia . 
  technically speaking , those both of those laws apply to both men and women . 
  it 's just that male and female genitals are different , so * in reality * , women have more rights in this regard . 
  that 's why i say it 's iffy . 
  yes , the same laws apply for men and women . 
  but no , men do n't have the right to genital integrity . 
  that 's kinda iffy , cause male and female genitals are different . 
  there currently is no conscription in germany .
