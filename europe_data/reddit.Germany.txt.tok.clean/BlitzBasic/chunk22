  that 's not a legal right . 
  men are ** unable ** to habe an abortion , that 's correct , because they are ** unable ** to get pregnant . 
  but they are n't ** forbidden ** to do so , at least not by any authority that humans could influence . 
  there is nothing forbidding men to have an abortion . 
  that 's no right , that cultural bias . 
  / u/dermac specifically talked about legal rights . 
  what legal rights do women have in germany that men do n't ? 
  because the question is if it 's `` very important '' . 
  if i think it 's important , but imo clean water , human dignity and personal freedom is more important , i might say it 's not `` very important '' and because of that not appear in this map . 
  except there are no kings any more . 
  the government is democratically legitimized , every war such a country gets into is either supported by the population or a defensive war . 
  explain that please . 
  some members of the police ! = the system . 
  one instance of covering up sexual harassment does n't has to mean that it 's systemic . 
  that 's ... actually pretty smart . 
  woosh . 
  germans face in the last panel is so fitting . 
  as long as it works it 's fine with me . 
  the un can allow wars . 
  not really , no . 
  that map seems legit , let 's do that . 
  we 'll call it ~ ~ viertes reich ~ ~ european federation . 
  what has `` my little pony '' to do with crimea ? 
  there is nothing undemocratic about electing the same government for 12 years straight . 
  because a nation that is not internationally recognized is about as good as no nation at all ? 
  you mean revolutionary burgundy ? 
  yeag , but he is a polite thief that shows respect for you . 
  just say what you think . 
  this is reddit , nobody will care . 
  chill , okay ? 
  sleep a bit , eat a banana , then come back and read again what bullshit you said . 
  says who ? 
  you do n't speak ill of the dead . 
  i 've been there , really great country , nice people . 
   alright you are completely insane , got it okay , so you insult me instead of adressing what i said ? 
   gay people ca n't do it with their gay partners and managed reproduction yeah , gay people ca n't have children with their partner . 
  but they can have children with people of the other gender , just like straight people . 
   you 're factually wrong . 
  no , you 're factually wrong . 
  see how easy it is to say that ? 
   you just keep twisting what i say in order for it to fit your agenda . 
  maybe you just suck at telling me your position . 
   if they can , then they stop performing gayness first of all , `` gayness '' is no actual word . 
  second , gay is something you are , not something you do . 
  third , you 're wrong . 
  just because a gay person has sex with a person of the other gender does n't makes them less gay . 
   its not as simple as `` do n't want to '' its the same as saying straight man simply `` does n't want to '' fuck another man , ridiculous why is that ridiculous ? 
  they do n't want to do it . 
  it 's totally irrelevant why . 
   yes , but are you aware that is done for fun and that they are capable of performing basic human mechanic whenever they want ? 
  so , exactly like gay people ? 
  gay people also do it for fun and can have vaginal sex whenever they want . 
   because it does n't suit your pc views damn son , you called my opinion pc . 
  that really convinces me that i 'm wrong . 
  because * clearly * nothing pc can ever be right . 
   im talking about basic human mechanic which led us all to this point if humanity was gay it would n't exist anymore well , good fucking thing that all humans are different from each other then . 
   so yea , gays ca n't reproduce unless they stop performing gayness they totally can . 
  they might dislike it , they might find it disgusting , but they can do it . 
   are you a second amendment supporter then ? 
  either they are both obsolete , or neither are . 
  what a stupid argument is that ? 
  the second amendment and nato are totally differnt things . 
  one of them can be obsolete without the other one being too . 
   sex organ going into other sex organ in order to reproduce is normal yeah , and gay people totally * can * do that . 
  they just do n't * want * to . 
   sex organ going into a hole that is designed to take out extra shit body does n't need is not normal you 're aware that there are also straight people that have anal sex ? 
  so they totally * can * reproduce , they just do n't want to . 
  last time i checked , there way no obligation for everybody to reproduce . 
   gays are unable to fulfill basic human mechanic except you 're wrong and gays can reproduce . 
  what have you edited then ? 
  well , that was fast , ukraine . 
  well , but most people do accept them , they are just unhappy with it . 
  saying that a decision sucked is totally acceptable in a democracy . 
  almost nobody has recognizeable landmarks in their pictures , just send the photo . 
  devolution ? 
   implying women are actual persons, 
  except your comparison sucks and citizenship is nothing like being member of a group of friends ? 
  they ** look ** badass , not they ** are ** badass . 
  big difference . 
  you can still see it because of the star , but tbh nobody pays attention to that . 
  it 's not really the fault of the media that they do n't report things you want to hear about . 
  the media will always report about the things that generate the most attention . 
  maybe you personally do n't care about israel , but many others do , so it get 's reported . 
  yes , they do n't have to care , you 're correct . 
  `` freiheit '' is german for `` liberty '' . 
  why do you ask ? 
  because they have greater ties with israel than with any of those countries ? 
  but it looks way cooler !, 
  but it still was part of spain , right ? 
  it just had more freedom . 
  heresy !, 
  bohemia always was german !, 
  bavaria actually was an independent state twohundred years ago , unlike catalonia . 
  damn , this comment section is a mess . 
  having * strategically * no other choice does n't makes their actions * legal * or * moral * . 
  it 's a tradition at this point . 
  it 's pretty cool , but it relies on arbitrarily claiming that certain branches are illegitimate . 
  i could take the same picture and simply move the `` illegitimate '' - signs around and i 'd have an argument why germany is the actual successor of the roman empire . 
  to be fair , those books are probably actually good . 
  if you look at how shitty the writing of `` mein kampf '' is the author can be happy he even made 85k sales .
