  it 's there on the paper , but until you actually piss off europe enoguh you ca n't be sure if they will really use it . 
  the position of the us is just plain unfair . 
  easy to defend , no dangerous countries nearby , no refugees reaching you , plenty of natural resources . 
  not enough range . 
  politicians do n't lead armys . 
  i do n't understand your argument . 
  what about germany and italy ? 
  for what reason ? 
  it 's easy to say `` we need a strong military '' , but there is currently no real reason to build one . 
  big interventions are unlikey with the current foreign politics of our countries , and russia is n't the giant threat it thinks it is . 
  a bigger army would eat more money and do bring almost no benefits . 
  that 's always the problem with armys . 
  in times of peace they eat money and give you exactly nothing in return while in times of war they are almost the single most important thing in your country . 
  makes it hard to find a balance . 
  does n't matters in the end . 
  their economy would n't hold long enough in during a war and the usa has an incredible headstart in available planes/tanks in addition to better technology . 
  the only advantage china has is the higher amount of manpower , but that ceases to be relevant when you ca n't produce enough equipment for all of them because all of your factories get ripped apart by airstrikes . 
  that 's the usa alone against china , if you add russia to becomes a serious stomp . 
  manpower just is n't really that deciding any more . 
  seems like a smart decision to me . 
   what 's germany doing ? 
  not a fucking thing . 
  we actually do something , we send planes to do recon . 
  a nice gesture so we can later say that we helped , but still small enough to avoid making us a prefered target . 
   the main point of an eu army would be to double our defences while keeping costs at the same level how does this work ? 
  why do the defences increase if you create an eu army ? 
  how do you see that chances that a conventional war of europe against russia actually stays a conventional war and does n't excalates into an nuclear exchange ? 
  that 's ... pretty hardcore . 
  what has russia done to you ? 
  that argument . 
  `` if things would go perfect there would be no risk '' . 
  no shit sherlock , but i could say the same thing about literally anything . 
  can you point me out any gun-related death not caused by : - human error - bad intention no ? 
  that means guns are perfectly safe if people would n't be too incompetent/stupid/lazy / evil , amirite ? 
  missed your / s ? 
  that 58 % of the people want him gone does n't means he is gone after the next election . 
  he can still get elected by 42 % if there are multiple other canidates that share the anti-erdogan votes . 
  i think it 's just the internet that makes people say this . 
  i doubt the general opinion in every country is that the death penalty should be reinstated . 
  do you just generally do n't believe in representative surveys or is the method/number in this one your problem ? 
  yeah , but it 's kind of funny because even in discussions that have nothing to do with hitler he will get mentioned and compared to whatever the person who mentions him argues again , because we all know that hitler was ** pure evil ** and if i find something you have in common with him you too have to be ** pure evil ** . 
  it 's making fun of this bullshit argument . 
  if the comparison is justified , the ` making fun of ' part falls away and the rule looses its reason of existing . 
  itt : the same comments as in all threads about turkey in the last weeks . 
  thanks . 
  sadly , that is n't the opinion of most people in this thread . 
  what would you predict happens next ? 
  wtf, 
  you mean , like with isreal and india ? 
  where it did n't work out at all ? 
  well , there was ( is ? ), 
  a catholic state , and in the middle ages rules often used god to legetimize themselves . 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  did you create that yourself ? 
  i 'd argue against it . 
  while the republic was flawed , the empire promoted slavery , torture and genocide , persecuted people for religious reasons and commited war crimes all the time . 
  the worst you can say about the senate is that it is useless as fuck . 
  why do n't you directly fly to austria/germany if you can fly to serbia ? 
  what happens when you need to prove your identity to the police ? 
  so if islamic countries do something good islam has nothing to do with it , but if they fuck up it 's totally the fault of islam ? 
  what ? 
  is n't every religion kind of an `` ideology '' ' ? 
  what makes islam special ? 
  asylum processes usually take longer than 15 days . 
  greece has to make sure that they are n't in danger if they get sent back to turkey . 
  assuming the birthrate stays the same . 
  oops . 
  i missed that . 
  sorry , just ignore me . 
  there were no 50000 arrests so far , just 50000 suspensions . 
  what ? 
  he never mentions england . 
  so , it 's no paranoia if they are really out to get you ? 
  it 's a standard phrase you always say when you take rights from the people . 
  it just is n't this funny in france because we believe that hollande will actually do what he says . 
  what do the labels say ? 
  you 're right . 
  migrants and people with a migration background . 
  reddit is no media at all . 
  reddit is an place for sharing informations and having discussions . 
  it 's not compareable to a newspaper or tv show because it does n't has a unified opinion . 
  if some people on reddit think it 's a staged coup that does n't proves anything beyond that fact that there are people in this world who actually believe that it 's a staged coup . 
  well , but it totally * should * . 
  it makes no sense otherwise . 
  i never said that anybody would be happy . 
  i was just replying to the `` it 's going to be hard to get used to it '' . 
  i could say the same about allowing guns . 
  sure , you create a chance that i shoot him , but you also create a chance that the other guy shoots me first . 
  that 's literally the same argumentation you use . 
  fair point . 
  okay , now the construction of scenarios to prove me wrong starts getting rediculus . 
   godwin 's law itself can be abused as a distraction , diversion or even as censorship , fallaciously miscasting an opponent 's argument as hyperbole when the comparisons made by the argument are actually appropriate . 
  claiming that the argument is a case of godwins law is bullshit if the comparison is actually appropriate . 
  i guess we 're both right . 
  what would he gain from blaming greece ? 
  the german flag is black at the top , not blue . 
  like mine . 
  what did he expect , the bundeswehr trying to force them to stay in the eu ? 
   if turkey attacked the united states you 'd see what an actual manufactured coup looks like and i was expecting some `` freedom and democracy '' . 
  ah , okay , makes sense .
