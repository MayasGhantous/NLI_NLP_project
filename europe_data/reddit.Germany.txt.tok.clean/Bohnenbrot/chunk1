except germany !, 
  on first glance i did n't see the number next to denmark and assumed they just made it a part of germany . 
  i am relieved now though , as they do not know our plans yet . 
  and turkey of course, 
  everything will be called `` outer european union '' by 2020 . 
  yeah , this should be obvious . 
  to make everything perfect we should just ban critizism or information of said treaties so they can be negotiated without outside interests having any influence !, 
  now that i think about it , all those conflicts of interests really harm most of our govermental functions , it would probably be for the best to make laws in secret as well , after all , all those silly voters need to stop bogging down our legislature !, 
  you clearly are biased . 
  gro\u00dfdeutsches reich obviously sounds much better !, 
  it seems highly unlikely to me that giving companies the ability to sue goverments should their profits be endangered is a measure to protect said the country should said goverment have a populist goverment or something along those lines . 
  i do n't want cases like [ this one ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/vattenfall-vs-germany-nuclear-phase-out-faces-billion-euro-lawsuit-a-795466.html ) happening more frequently . 
  in terms of food standards , in general standards are higher in europe ( for example hormone meat ) . 
  ttip will align many standards , because of that , it seems quite likely that instead of making the most consumer friendly regulation the standard , it will instead be the most profitable one . 
  as said before , in general i do not oppose fta 's , however an agreement that is made both in secret and without any real democratic institution severly involved is unacceptable in my opinion . 
  it seems to me that they are highly likely to be decided though , and when they are , it will be too late for me to complain . 
  i do not care about this one simply because it is more polticized , i care about all the friendly ceta 's , tisa 's etc. 
  out there . 
  the fact that all international negotiations are done in secret is a horrible argument , something being done often does not make it good . 
  i will insist on my point , if it is good for us , tell us what it actually is . 
  so please , explain to me why i should be happy about investment protection and lowering of food standards . 
  i am not . 
  if the thing is as fantastic for us as we are being told there should n't be any issues with us knowing the contents . 
  i have no issues with it being a free trade agreement , however , i will not accept laws that are made without any democratic influence whatsoever . 
  moreover , the ep does not have the rights to stop it even if they do vote to do so in the final draft . 
  if the commission wants , they can easily push it through . 
  we have no fucking idea what exactly it is , we have no way to decide whether we want it and the few things that we do know are quite shitty for us . 
  sadly most of us are busy reading boulevard press and believing that southern and eastern europe is stealing our money ... sorry for that, 
  that 's not entirely corrrect . 
  it was actually the european side which said that `` one country can not at the same time be a member of a customs union and be in a deep common free-trade area with the european union '' ( quote by michael barroso , who was eu-commision president back then . ), 
  this lead to yanukovich not signing the association agreement , which was one of the major causes for the maidan protests . 
  not trying to imply that there was no pressure from russia , however european involvement should n't be ignored, 
  just out of interest , are you doing it mostly because of their criticism of immigration or because of their eurosceptic position ? 
  or maybe something entirely different ? 
  i know that it sounds strange if germans cry about their social systems as they are still quite good when compared to many other countries , but here are some examples of what the conservatives ( cdu ) , social democrats ( spd ) and greens have done in the last 15 years before the spd & greens changed it , pensions in germany were quite okay for everyone , however , as germany has an aging population they deemed reforms necessary and reduced pensions for everybody but introduced the `` riester rente '' to compansate for it . 
  the riester rente is controlled by private companies and is structured in a way that for anyone that does not have a huge income and therefore does not have to worry about his or her pension , it is absolutely useless as there is really no way they 'd even break even in the end , which means that those who did buy into this have simply been scummed for their money . 
  overall , current govermental statistics list that 40 % of the german working population will live in poverty during their pension in general the spd & greens did a lot of this shit ( which is why the spd still has n't even come close to their 20th century election results ) . 
  the most prominent thing is the `` agenda 2010 '' which featured fun stuff such as less investment in social benifets and a significantly enlarged low-wage sector . 
  overall , we also suck at education , and are one of the worst developed countries when it comes to giving everyone equal oppertunities in terms of education . 
  ( if you want i could probably find a statistic for this ) what also really bothers me is that our industry just seems to have such a large say in our media , we just recently introduced a ( pretty low ) minimum wage and tv and news papers were completely full of our economical elites crying about how this minimum wage would ruin our economy , without mentioning its economical benifits a single damn time . 
  i 'd write some stuff about about surveillance and ttip , but i 'll just some those up as the goverment doing a ton of stuff that we should all be mad about but are n't because most of this country seems to fucking love angela merkel even though she has n't really accomplished anything, 
  but muh austerity :(, 
  in germany our social democratic party has joined the conservatives in fucking over workers & the general population in as many ways as possible . 
  its been this way for 15 years now and those 2 parties still control roughly 75 % of our parliament , opposition does n't really do much as our green party was pretty content about fucking over the population with the social democrats when they were part of the goverment . 
  all in all , things have become worse and will keep getting worse, 
  is bashing russia your hobby or something ? 
  i am definetely not the biggest fan of them either but you seem to post antirussian comments in every 2nd thread that i open ... 
  especially as youth unemployment is 2nd highest in the eu right after greece . 
  but atleast your budget is balanced , that will surely feed people , horray austerity ... 
  exactly !, 
  they 'd obviously pick poland , duh !, 
  aww cmon , secretly you wish we had taken a bit more in 1864 do n't you ? 
  i can understand that turkey would be a bit wary , but its been 40 years now and stopping the occupation would make talks with the eu a lot easier , i guess its just very hard due to political reasons, 
  i know exactly what happened , and i have no problems with the turkish goverment stepping in to protect their people , there is however no need to keep it occupied to this date , as cyprus is now a democracy and a member of the european union, 
  we really like them !, 
  would love to get more close with them , 
  do n't worry old friend !, 
  just spreading deutschla - uhh , de - uhh , de - democracy !, 
  yes yes , just spreading some democracy !, 
  ^ ^ what ^ ^ was ^ ^ that ^ ^ other ^ ^ stuff ^ ^ the ^ ^ colonies ^ ^ liked , hmmmm , ahh yes , freedom as well , i am spreading lots of freedom, 
  yes yes !, 
  we should rename out though so the russians do n't find it !, 
  i nominate prussia as a name ~ ~ for these new provinces ~ ~ this new neighbor of the german ~ ~ empire ~ ~ nation, 
  damn , precisely did n't use ukraine as an example because of this but putin simply is too glorious :'(, 
  its mind boggling that they are even allowed to control a part of it . 
  a turkish claim on cyprus is about as strong as a russian claim on poland ... 
  you know , that one where they metaphorically grill sausages in trains , it really is obvious !, 
   i for one have reasoned that once we have a good enough economy , population will follow . 
  do n't hold your breath , if you 're anything like us everyone will have less kids rather than more \\ ^ ^, 
  you guys really need to watch your aggressive expansion !, 
  do n't get too sad over it , you 're not comparing yourself to some normal country here but to motherfucking eesti . 
  just look at her , she is so pretty !, 
  happy freedom from the soviet union day latvia !, 
   you realize that not all newly strengthened european parties are the same when it comes to economical and social policy , right ? 
  which is why i picked out an example and talked about that as i do not know every single european far right party . 
  we had no spare brooms sadly :(, 
  i guess we are on the same page then ? 
  do you not believe that parties that seek to impose the values of a certain religion upon the population are problematic ? 
  yes, 
  [ they stand no chance against our mighty airforce ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fdjooit.png ), 
  yes , i do not believe religions should play a role in politics . 
  i 'll just quote one of my other comments about this topic :  the afd wants to significantly reduce the insurence provided by employers in the event of an accident at work , cut taxes on the rich and on inheritance ( which mainly helps the rich ) and cut the aid given to low-wage employees and the jobless ( they have the brilliant idea of privatising our unemployment subsidies , so that our unemployed can just pay for the self with money they get from , uhh , somewhere you know )  overall , their cuts in taxes on the rich would cost us several tens of billions of euros each year , which they would regain by cutting the aid given to those struggling financially . 
  overall they do not give a shit about the poor but simply seek to exploit them for votes . 
  [ source ( sadly in german , i 'll edit if i find a good english article on the topic . 
  ) ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article153335239/alternative-fuer-reiche-wo-die-afd-sparen-will.html ) theres a lot more to it , but these are a few examples that are quite clear in my opinion . 
  the german afd is definetely strongly christian . 
  atleast in germany this is not true at all . 
  the afd wants to significantly reduce the insurence provided by employers in the event of an accident at work , cut taxes on the rich and on inheritance ( which mainly helps the rich ) and cut the aid given to low-wage employees and the jobless ( they have the brilliant idea of privatising our unemployment subsidies , so that our unemployed can just pay for the self with money they get from , uhh , somewhere you know ) overall , their cuts in taxes on the rich would cost us several tens of billions of euros each year , which they would regain by cutting the aid given to those struggling financially . 
  overall they do not give a shit about the poor but simply seek to exploit them for votes . 
  yeah , the right really simply believes that the left is simply misguided , thats why / r/the _ donald is famous for its objective criticism of left wing politics ... 
  you really believe that the far right will further yours ? 
  the afds party program for example is strongly anti-worker , featuring reductions of their rights in many areas . 
  uhhhmm , i have no idea what you are talking about !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ ^ thing : ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ time ^ ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ ^ italy . 
  true !, 
  thank god all that warmongering is now in the past though !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ austria ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ czechia , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ balkans , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ k ? 
  i do n't even now , it does n't make much sense considering we were only bombed to the ground once , and that was ~ 75 years ago - must be some meme, 
  finally someone that does n't talk about us being warmongerers !, 
  i guess they were n't too happy about that whole austerity thing after all,
