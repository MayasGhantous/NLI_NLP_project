  all that was said is that the uk wont get any special treatment in negotiations . 
   i 'm willing to bet this federal sub is full of germans with a smattering of other wealthy nations of western europe thrown in . 
  it 's great to be idealistic when you live in the `` best '' performing countries . 
  you vastly underestimate support for a united europe in the central/eastern europe . 
  [ there is quite a lot of it already ] ( https://imgur.com/wg6mwyb ) . 
   that 's the problem , you believe , yet this is not a religion we 're talking about . 
  and you believe you share a lot with other dutch people  europe does not share many values . 
  democratic governance , human rights , culture heavily influenced by christianity , respect for human dignity etc. 
  ring any bells ? 
   they do n't need to be if you believe in the diversity of humanity , the co-existence of communities and mutual respect and consideration . 
  thats a very rosy picture but its basis in reality is limited . 
  we 've got a war in our neighborhood right now and the eu has had many problems with formulating a united response to it . 
  unless you have a nation just for yourself , you always share sovereignty and are n't entirely free and independent . 
  we band together in nations because we feel like `` one people '' , and federalists want support that idea on a european level . 
   my local community has no sovereignty , that could not be argued , that 's a fact , we 're in a social contract with a lot more local communities together forming 17,5 million people who are together sovereign . 
  and we want to build this on a european level . 
   at the time all these local communities that formed our country had a lot of important things is common . 
  we do not have that with the eu . 
  many of us believe we do !, 
  europe shares many values and has moved a lot closer together in the past decades . 
  as single nations wont be able to be very influential in the future , we believe that we would all benefit from working together . 
   i feel close to some europeans , not at all to others , but none of them as close as to my compatriots . 
  and thats a valid opinion , but some of us feel connected to this `` larger '' group , just as e.g. 
  italians or germans did in the 19th century , which is why we want to build it . 
  it depends on how you see it really . 
  you could argue that your local community has no sovereignty because it does n't matter much when compared to your whole country . 
  its all about how close people feel to each other and how willing they are to share a political system . 
  if you feel very close to dutch people and not close to other europeans at all you 'll obviously be opposed to federalisation , but many europeans including me feel very connected and believe that we would be stronger together . 
  no one wants to make ireland unfree however !, 
  its about * sharing * sovereignty , not giving it up , and it will only ever happen if the irish people want it . 
  leaving is really only a headache because you lose out on the benefits you previously had . 
  if they had never joined they would n't have had the benefits of the common market at all . 
  i do n't think about you at all, 
  your opinion is of course valid , but federalism would be nothing like british rule , no one would force ireland to join and if it wanted to leave it would be able to do so whenever it wanted . 
  it would also be an equal member , not a conquered territory !, 
  and good bridges make good friends !, 
  [ you_irl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r42mfx3_ss ), 
  man , you did all those things and yet ca n't pass a healthcare bill !, 
  sad !, 
  even sweden alone beat you , you stand no chance against the might of yuropean memery, 
   germany is quite the opposite . 
  the idea of germany is pretty new , 150 years they were still a bunch of blondes dudes with mustachs and weird pants doing barbaric stuff here and there . 
  even tho they were all blondes dudes in tights , it took them a very long time to realize they might be cousins or something . 
  when they realized it , the first thing they did was to invite themself in france . 
  modern german history in a nutshell, 
  why are you sad ? 
  bratislava is right there !, 
  not yet !, 
  i love you too , darling, 
  `` how dare these people not be miserable ! '', 
  especially you , 
  [ join us ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europeanfederalists/ ) in talking about how to make it the same country ( kinda ) !, 
  world war 2 do n't real, 
  woops , will correct . 
  violent crime has also dropped , take a look at the [ homicide rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate_by_decade#1990s ) . 
  in general crime has dropped significantly . 
  eastern europe has seen a significant decrease in crime after the problems that the fall of communism caused began to become less widespread . 
   fatal accidents are just that , horrible misfortunes - tragedies of the worst kind . 
  violent crimes tend to be reduced by better economic conditions and increased education levels . 
  and we , as a society , are working hard to improve both on accidents and on the need and use of unwarranted violence . 
  if you look at the link that i posted you 'll see that homicides have also dropped i am not saying that radical islam is not a problem however , it obviously is and we need to find a way to deal with it . 
  so islamic extremism is the only relevant factor ? 
  crime has consistently dropped in almost every country in the last two decades , especially in eastern europe ( as it was very high in communist/post communist times ) . 
  while terrorism is more of recent phenomenon , homicide rates have actually [ decreased . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate_by_decade#1990s ) while there are fluctuations , europe has generally become a lot safer over time . 
  not only in terms of homocides but also other crimes , road accidents etc. 
  its just that media coverage has sharply increased and that terrorism , which gets far more coverage in general , has also risen . 
  of course this does not diminish the suffering that such attacks inflict upon us , we just need to keep in mind that we live in some of safest countries in one of the safest times . 
   europe is safter than ever do you think this statement is wrong ? 
   france is religious  russia is not religious lol, 
  this one is simply adorable . 
  look at that cute little eu !, 
   we 're probably the only country on earth where women vote for the right side of politics more than men . 
  that one is sort of weird to me . 
  i 've read about afd voters mostly being men [ quite a lot ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-01/afd-pediga-warum-wenig-frauen-miitmachen ) . 
  do our women just vote a lot less in general ? 
  genuinely confused by this . 
  i do n't worry , you 'll be there too - you just do n't know it yet < 3, 
  we 'll just not invite the english and proclaim the second frankish empire, 
   greatest extent triggered, 
  pls let us stay :(, 
  man , no wonder things went south when we imported one of your guys to be our leader, 
   i think they know very well they should apply for asylum earlier well , they actually [ are n't required to do so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation#partial_suspension_during_2015_european_migrant_crisis ) . 
  i also sort of fail to see as to how it would 've solved the problem , as the people would still be there . 
  the identification problem is obviously very real however . 
  i do n't even ... 
  i do n't really think it is that much of a taboo to be honest ? 
  i think most europeans are very aware that there really is n't a better region to live in , we just do n't feel the need to rub it into everyones face , 
  i agree that the legal basis is certainly not optimal and that it was n't handled very well , but i would n't say that that is the fault of those on their way to germany , as we can hardly expect them to know the details of european asylum law . 
  i do n't really understand that argument to be honest . 
  if they know that they 're more likely to get asylum in germany why would they apply in hungary or serbia ? 
  regardless of what you think of current migration , i do n't think calling the russians that came during soviet times `` immigrants '' us accurate . 
  was n't it pretty much a colonisation + russification program ? 
  i think complaining about your country has become a central european value at this point, 
  schulz = dear leader confirmed, 
  yeah , like every german i am an evil hun wanting to rule the world . 
  you sure got me there . 
  i 'm saying that the could have , not that they should have . 
  `` germany leads the eu because they did x '' is n't a convincing argument when many others could do the exact same thing . 
  ( and in the case of italy , have dealt with the issue almost alone for a long time ) .
