  great news , putins actions in eastern ukraine are simply disgusting .

  the un refers to the hdi as `` potential human development '' , take a look at the [ ihdi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi ) if you want the `` actual development '', 
  tfw we do n't have a european army to liberate the ~ ~ colonies ~ ~ overseas territories yet :(, 
  i 'd be interested in seeing how spending has changed as % of all government spending . 
  my guess is that spending as % of gdp has dropped since we 've lowered taxes etc , which would create a smaller disparity between 90s spending on todays spending . 
  france is one of the most developed countries in the world with a living standard higher than the japan , the u.s. and many others . 
  times are a bit difficult currently , but thats no reason to elect someone that wants to destroy the things the french of worked on for decades . 
  i know how you feel , its even more funny when people claim that the afd will win everything , considering that they are slowly fading into irrelevancy again . 
  best of luck with your election !, 
  hopefully things will be more calm in france when the next ones roll around . 
  tbh i do n't get the hype around them . 
  we had [ cool uniforms ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/59/90/e6/5990e63fc30f61239389f4b86f628b3c.jpg ) once , but everything after world war 1 is pretty much universally boring . 
  have there ever been elections in france with neither the ps nor the republicans making it to the second round ? 
  seems like a first, 
   eu is not going to became united states of europe any time soon . 
  feels bad man :(, 
  do n't forget [ identify ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4elcamdqoy ) heinrich is my spirit animal, 
  the second one is me irl, 
  i think it made rounds on twitter and i saw it somewhere on reddit , not sure how accurate it is . 
  i thought this was n't the case - is [ this ] ( https://i.reddituploads.com/eb245b31aa0745569f054bb1831db688?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=7d1798a85709bc4a89d045652d296d97 ) chart innacurate ? 
  and i would have gotten away with it too , if it was n't for you meddling holl\u00e4nders !, 
   morally i can not abide by your `` trade '' ... 
  the state does n't decide on opinions in this case . 
  it makes sure that those who seek to destroy democracy are not tolerated by it . 
   what do you make of the fact that norway ... you 're comparing apples to oranges here . 
  germany had an irrelevant far right movement , with the afd only gaining votes due to our involvement in the migrant crisis , the extent of which is n't remotely comparable to norwegian involvement . 
  norway also has pretty much the highest standard of living in the world and comparetively few issues with migrants . 
   could you entertain the possibility that censoring the beliefs of neo nazis is not only morally wrong ... its not morally wrong . 
  giving them a platform is . 
  their ideology is disgusting and we must never even begin to tolerate them . 
  the risk is simply too high to let them have their way . 
  my country has been in that situation , and we have to do everything to make sure it never is again . 
   finally , fascists will not gain any significant ... its not that simply . 
  without strong measures against them they will creep back everytime a country is in bad shape . 
  checks and balances are one thing to avoid this , but doing everything we can not to normalize their views is another . 
  we ca n't afford to tolerate the intolerant . 
  hate speech laws would n't be necessary in a perfect world , but sadly they are . 
  the government * needs * to stand against hate speech and incitement of violence . 
  not because the people are too stupid to decide which opinions are valid or not , but because even the slightest risk of these ideas becoming popular again is extremely dangerous . 
  we 've seen what they inevitably lead to and if a few neo nazis being unable to speak their mind is all it takes to make sure it does n't happen again i am happy to take that trade . 
  the opinion is not criminalized , spreading it is . 
  heres a german link , could n't find anything good in english : https://m.heute.de/detail/46613910, 
  schulz has said that he 'd do it if he won, 
  thats just how it always is sadly , people also go to pizza hut and think they had pizza , 
  that is pretty fucking cool, 
  oh , i personally do n't mind us taking a more active role in the world . 
  as long as our interventions abroad are similar to e.g. 
  the french mission in mali ( meaning that we work together with local governments , respect international law and use our influence to combat radicalism ) i am fine with it . 
  just do n't tell the scandinavians, 
  i do n't think we are afraid of having a large military per se , its just that we are quite pacifistic and thus very worried that `` wrong '' things might be done with it . 
  support for european defence integration is very high , but many are worried that us increasing spending is the first step to us starting our own iraq war . 
  there also quite simply a lot of distrust of the military , and many just do n't see a point to increasing spending because of this . 
  i do n't think anyone actually minds us assisting our allies . 
  us helping the french in mali , sending troops to the baltics etc. 
  does n't really seem too controversial except for some on the far left/right . 
  personally i am fine with us increasing spending even though i do n't really think it is necessary . 
  i do however believe that further eu defence integration should be our number one priority . 
  brb raising military spending to 120 % of gdp, 
  feels like the nation most scared of a large german military is germany . 
  oh how things have changed , heh . 
  or even more so , 
  72 days `` did she win ? '', 
   greatest state cries in rheinl\u00e4ndisch, 
  did you miss us ? 
  do n't forget that we 're always just one austria away from going full reich again !, 
  my man, 
  yes , we should all panic about migrants voting in communal elections now . 
  being worried about the leadership of the most powerful country in the world would be silly anyways , its not like it could ever affect us . 
  ... in communal elections . 
  i ^ was ^ ^ trying ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  so you 're saying people want to be called hitler ? 
  well , both sides have but since concrete proposals are n't too numerous we can mostly debate ideas i guess, 
   as of right now it is also as you said hard to argue against him simply because his positions are so slippery because there is no official program yet , but he is already campaigning . 
  i assure you that problem goes both ways , ca n't really argur in favor of something unless you know what it is , 
   i can also see that we have to find a middle ground , but that does not sound like it is what schulz is proclaiming in this speech . 
  it looks like he wants to turn back time and abolish the progress made by the agenda 2010 . 
  he wants to [ `` correct '' ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2017-02/spd-martin-schulz-korrekturen-agenda-2010-arbeitslosengeld ) it though , not abolish it . 
  supporting those who lost their jobs more strongly and protecting workers rights is in my opinion a large portion of what went wrong with the agenda . 
  in general i like his idea of keeping the strong backbone that the reform gave our economy while adressing the issues that came with it , but in many ways it is too early for me to accurately judge it right now . 
  things will get interesting once the party program is released and we can accurately judge the ways in which he wants to adjust the agenda 2010 . 
  someone x-post to / r/yurop, 
  unless you have some facts to back that assumption up i do n't see why this would ever be the consequence . 
  the exact same argument was repeated again and again when we introduced minimum wage , and the economic fallout that many predicted did not follow in the slightest . 
  the agenda 2010 was helpful in many areas and did a lot to get us through the crisis , but it has also contributed to constantly rising inequality . 
  we need to find a middle ground that preserves our economic strength while actually letting those at the bottom recieve the fruits of their work , otherwise we 'll look like the u.s. in a few decades . 
  our economic growth is n't actually that high currently , we are however doing very well in terms of unemployment when compared to many other european economies . 
  while most of the new jobs are indeed full-time positions ( which is to be expected in in the aftermath of a crisis ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/navigation/statistik/statistik-nach-themen/beschaeftigung/beschaeftigung-nav.html ) does n't seem to support your notion of a `` giant drop '' at all . 
  he 's not trying to destroy them , he 's trying to combat the sharp rise in inequality that they have lead to . 
  the better life index again does not take inequalities into account , which are the entire reason as to why the u.s. is ranked so much lower . 
  it also includes metrics such as voter turnout which are n't really related to human development but highly influenced by local culture . 
  quite strange that you do n't have any relevant indicators that support your idea that the u.s. is richer then , right ? 
  its also very interesting that you , as a totally european person , would refer to other europeans as [ `` you europeans '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shiteuropeanssay/comments/5rw0jb/its_even_more_racist_to_call_black_americans/ddl89b3/ ) . 
  but whatever the case , i do n't really see how you being european would be relevant . 
  first off , use ppp to atleast get a somewhat better idea of which gdp per capita is higher . 
  secondly , if you believe that gdp = development you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about and this discussion is pointless . 
  be so kind and take your mindless trash talking of european countries somewhere else . 
  does n't really change the point of what i said , does it ? 
  the connection is obvious .
