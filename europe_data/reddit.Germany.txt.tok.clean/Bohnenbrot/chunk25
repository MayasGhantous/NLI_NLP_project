  obviously it would n't be right to force it through at any time . 
  i think that a common defence policy and perhaps even common armed forces have or a fiscal union would be good next steps . 
  the european parliament should also be strengthened . 
  i 'd argue that the biggest issue with the euro was that integration in other areas such as common fiscal policy did n't come first . 
  i believe that a federal , or atleast more strongly integrated europe is essential to ensure europes safety and prosperity in the coming decades . 
  there is no mention of any concrete implemention there , but appareantly you have your mind made up so i really see no point in talking this out with you, 
  its funny how you construct this huge strawman out of me saying that i like the idea of a fiscal union, 
  the eu has changed a lot in recent years , and has constantly ( with e.g. 
  the lisbon treaty ) moved towards a union that is less controlled by the european nations and more controlled by the european people . 
  a fiscal union would have to be implemented together with further political integration and democratization . 
  thats good !, 
  ... i think, 
  its very interesting that you appereantly know more about my worldview than i do, 
  i like the idea of europeans collectively deciding what to do with their money, 
  i 'd like it even more, 
  far more than any other kind of terrorism in fact . 
  all countries on earth should just agree to devaluate their currency at the same time , it would solve all our problems !, 
  holy shit moldova, 
  `` some people '' is very ambigious , who exactly are you talking about ? 
  betreten, 
  we very very rarely have sole ruling parties in germany . 
  currently the cdu is ruling in a coalition with the social democrats , and before that they coalitioned with the liberals . 
  whatever the case , we 're a very anti-military country and raising defence spending is generally not viewed very favorable . 
  public opinion is however in favor of further european defence cooperation , but there simple is n't a whole lot of public support for interventionism - and most believe our current capabilities to be sufficient for defence . 
  look pal , just because your favourite `` politician '' loves making stupid requests and then raging on twitter about them does n't mean everyone else has to, 
  no , 4 is n't enough . 
  snowy bucharest is life . 
  no puppet . 
  you 're the puppet !, 
  [ `` dumpster fire '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi#/media/file:inequality-adjusted_human_development_index_2014.svg ), 
  sadly they are, 
  it does n't have to be for their to be some aspects that show a monotonic development . 
  worldwide population & economic growth for example have shown this patter in modern history ( with a few exceptions ) , and in many western countries the same can be said about e.g. 
  minority rights, 
  i do n't think anyone is seriously butthurt over it , its just kind of a silly meme considering how strong france has been for the last 500 + years, 
  yeah , i 'm sure that the country with the 2nd highest migrant population in the world ca n't handle `` mixed ethnic heritages '' . 
  i was merely poking at the fact that many americans are proud of their european heritage and consider themselves partially irish , german , french or whatever while knowing absolutely nothing about those countries, 
  til eastern europe is 146 % nazi, 
  you 're like a walking meme lol, 
  you and me both, 
  1/64th italian ? 
  i 'm not italian , but god , i 'm so fucking triggered right now, 
  poland !, 
  actually trade with europe is relatively balanced , most of the surplus comes from trade with the rest of the world iirc, 
  well , if we 're including non-tricolors there [ is only one answer for me ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/flag_of_europe.svg/800px-flag_of_europe.svg.png ), 
  i love the estonian flag , the color combination is just downright glorious , almost as sexy as the [ 2nd spanish republic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/flag_of_spain_%281931_-_1939%29.svg/1000px-flag_of_spain_%281931_-_1939%29.svg.png ), 
   too bad france and germany still hate freedom . 
  liberal economic policy does not equal freedom .

  you are worried because our government wants to legalize sex ? 
   the feeling of public safety is not necessarily the same as a crime statistic . 
  you said they feel unsafer because they are unsafer , he brought up statistics that prove they are in fact not unsafer . 
  so in your opinion their safety is not related to ... their actual safety ? 
  by this time i am convinced that whenever the roman empire is brought up someone will state `` the roman empire fell because of this specific thing which i dislike and which i believe we are doing again '', 
  makes sense for an american to say that , heh , 
  i 'd love to vote for the spd as they were about 20 years ago , back then they seemed to actually still care about the s in their name . 
  i want to like die linke because they 're the only ones to not completely embrace neoliberalism and privatization , but their foreign policy alone is enough to make me extremely sceptical . 
  cdu lacks any long term solutions to the problems facing our countries , fdp seem to not give 2 shits about personal liberties and afd is out of the question for me . 
  greens do many things that i consider idiotic but ultimately i 'll probably end up voting for them . 
  realistically , i just hope that union/green / ( + maybe fdp ) form a coalition . 
  red-red-green seems impossible with how different the three parties are . 
  worst case for me is another grand coalition , because its toxic for both our conservatives and our social democrats imo . 
  yeah , the issue for many people including me is that seemingly we have the choice between status quo , irresponsible populism and a party that we do n't want to vote for because of other reasons ( fdp ), 
  sweden ? 
  i would n't blame this solely on the local authorieties , they failed miserably in this case , but our government was n't prepared on any level really . 
  we could have been prepared a lot better had our government not chosen to ignore the problems that the mediteranian countries have had for many years , which is why i would put a lot of blame on cdu/csu as well . 
  they 've been in government for more than a decade and clearly did n't do enough to prepare . 
  now we just have to go through all the exes until we reach charlemagne lol, 
  i thought about including central & eastern europe but central europe funding central europe just sounded pretty weird to me , maybe new members or sth . 
  would have been better haha, 
  atleast call us ex-allied occupation zones , 
  ahh , now i get !, 
  i do n't know enough about economics to predict whether the 2008 economic crisis would have hit you harder with or without , but in general more trade does make them easier to handle ( e.g. 
  protectionism was one of the reasons for the crash in the 30s ), 
   you terk our moneyz for free so stfu ignorant type of comments i see quite often . 
  yeah , those are pretty stupid while eastern europe has profited a lot from european cooperation , it has n't been at the expense of central/western europe ( quite the opposite actually ) so theres really no sense in being smug about it, 
  i believe i do n't really understand , you can hardly blame a worldwide economic crash on a few eastern european countries can you ? 
  to be fair , austria and every other western country profits from workers and trade with eastern europe and will profit even more in the future as a prosperous romania will trade even more - thats the beauty of european economic cooperation , we all get something out it, 
  found the scot !, 
  the bavarians secretly loved them all those years and now keep their memory alive, 
  too lazy to check because i 'm on mobile but i always thought republic just meant that rule was n't inherited - but i am not sure about that, 
  why not ? 
  it was the union of soviet socialist republics after all , making them republics ( not democratic republics of course ), 
  i do n't think `` republic '' is there right term there lol, 
  do n't worry buddy , its still legal in your country so just ask your daddy for a little beating every now and then to avoid becoming `` decadent '' , 
  you 're france , everyone pretends to think of you as snobs while secretly loving you , 
  love you too , little guy < 3, 
  the eu has done most of what it has the authority to do , its just that it can only do as much as the member states allow and there are many that seem to simply not care ( sadly including many of my countrymen ), 
  he probably disagrees with the fact that you consider not breaking international law and not annexing territory of neighbooring states `` stupid '', 
  so you 're angry because i am asking why you 're so angry ? 
   britain walking away from the echr could well constitute unilateral withdrawal from the gfa i know nothing about the legality of the gfa but if there is even a chance that this would happen this is an absolutely horrible idea, 
  why do you have such strong feelings about what other people eat ? 
  yeah but you see its the truth in our case :(, 
  oh do n't mind me i 'm just doing what we germans do best ( complaining ), 
  why in the world would someone decide to make this a gif, 
  so is our bread , if you move against it your baguettes will burn !, 
  if you try and take our bread or beer we will revolt !, 
   only if you help us ~ ~ reconquer ~ ~ liberate what is rightfully ours .

  maybe we should let bygones be bygones and focus on the future !,
