   it 's so depressing , everyone is still thinking they are only helping good people , and there are no rotten apples . 
  maybe we believe that there are rotten apples anywhere ( including within germany , as has been demonstrated perfectly ) and the decent refugees deserve a shot as well ? 
  really , who is saying that there are no rotten apples ? 
  of course there are . 
  among a million refugees , there ** have to be ** murderers and rapists and a shitton of thieves . 
  ( as there are among a million germans . ), 
  i 'll even grant you that the number will be somewhat higher than among germans ( being displaced and coming from an ongoing civil war ) . 
  but the majority of refugees are still simply people coming from a shitty place who try to do best for them and their families . 
  all these dashcam videos have taught me that there is an axe or baseball bat stashed away in every car . 
  you should be able to agree on the sauna part . 
  working out gay stuff is next-level issue . 
  are you really scared about terrorists and passports ? 
  suicide causes more than 40000 deaths each year in the u.s. , influenza even more ( more than a thousand of those for people under 35 alone , it is n't just an old lady thing ) . 
  35000 or so die on the road in ( just ) motor vehicle accidents . 
  a few thousand drown . 
  alcohol-induced deaths are close to 30000 . 
  people lack perspective . 
  osha saves more people 's lives each year than the department of homeland security ever will . 
  mandatory rubberized ladder steps would probably be far more effective in saving lives than changing visa rules could ever be . 
  filthy oil grabbing norwegians ... ( i assume ) . 
  on that topic , a lot depends on how they factored that in . 
  edit : climate & energy is your lowest scored category , so that may indeed be a major cause . 
  sampling size means we never will know . 
  we simply do not have enough data to make a case either way . 
  i think the world overall needs tighter labour regulations , but it probably is n't too helpful to be the leader of the pack unless you already have full employment . 
  agreed . 
  immigrants that attend university are usually a boon for a country ; even those that leave quite often . 
  actually it does n't usually . 
  most leftists are usually very annoyed when the racical anarchists or the `` schwarzer block '' crash their demonstrations and go violent & crazy . 
  first it is wrong and second it negatively reflects on the broader left ( which champions peaceful protests ) . 
  this one is actually not a conspiracy ( not as in `` crazy '' , but it also is n't a secretly hidden cabal ) . 
  russia has been financing some right-wing parties in europe of late . 
  it has n't exactly been advertised , but it also has n't been too secretive . 
  supression is bad . 
  convincing people not to vote for them is good . 
  how is that not obvious ? 
  they have the freedom to spout their nonsense , we have the freedom to disagree . 
  we are happy when our message resonates and their voting share comes in below expectation . 
  there is no particular supression going on here ( as in a rigged electoral or media system ) , so they lost fair and square . 
  they do not have a majority of people behind them , only a plurality . 
  which is why they get some votes in parliaments but ca n't actually excercise power . 
  which is as it should be in such a situation , in a democracy . 
  i know some of their supporters have convinced themselves that they are the `` silent majority '' but that is simply not true . 
  their views are not representative of most people , so they have to deal with that . 
  they do n't tend to fly up/down that much . 
  for most situations , you can eyeball & math it on a two-dimensional map . 
   of the most powerful nation on earth at least make it * one of * . 
  he was implying that the rebels might have captured ukrainian army stock and used them , not that the ukrainian army had any use of those missiles in this conflict . 
  just because you do n't need them now does n't meant they are n't stored ( and captured ) . 
  and in fact it is acknowledged that both russia and ukraine operate this identical kind of system . 
  i doubt they truly expected the russian jet to bomb a target within turkey . 
  this is just a combination of repeated incidents , prior warnings and turkey & russia having very different goals/allies in syria . 
  interesting , sure . 
  but not as apocalyptic as r/worldnews / already seems to think . 
  could also be syrian , which would n't change the diplomatic situation in the region much . 
  why have they been duds ? 
  by antagonizing more muslims . 
  plenty already live here ( and it is very difficult to stop refugees from arriving or to limit illegal immigration ) . 
  if you follow their extremists down the road of hostile relations , you make their recruitment more easy . 
  most muslims living in europe only care about their lives in the ordinary way . 
  a pay-raise , a new ipad , a flat screen tv and hopefully grandpa does n't take ill . 
  there will always be a small part/percentage of disgruntled , disillusioned or untethered muslims who are amenable to recruitment . 
  you can do a lot to increase that number from 0.05 % to 0.1 % . 
  ( so from 3-5 million in france , depending on how you count , you might raise the number of potential * active * extremists from 2.000 to 4.000 . ), 
  we are always taking about the most dedicated , loose , crazy part of that population . 
  they are also the hardest to keep out , as they are ( if they want to attack ) well funded and reasonably well organized . 
  you are just going to get rid of most of those that do no harm and they can then recruit them from wherever you sent them back to after they are now open to recruitment ( when they are suddenly in a differnt place , without job , and bitter ) . 
   none of that will deter them . 
  that is true . 
  but they do thrive on the attention generated , including the negative attention . 
  they wo n't do any less damage ( rather : more ) if our politics start to be centered around anti-terrorism . 
  quite likely that i would n't . 
  it still remains true . 
  what do you think * their * intention is ? 
  they * want * to instill fear . 
  they want to provoke a reaction . 
  people choose the way of least resistance . 
  does n't mean it would suffice if that would be the best way in . 
  plenty of migration . 
  i did n't say defensive structures could n't help against * armies * . 
  does n't work , never worked historically . 
  people can easily cut fences and climb walls . 
  look at the us southern border . 
  or look at how much effort ( mines & automated gun emplacements , etc. ), 
  east germany had to use to secure a very , very short part of the iron curtain . 
  which is the main purpose of ** terror ** ism , to inspire terror . 
  try not to let it get to you . 
  keep in mind that living in a big city like paris or new york or warsaw , you are still more likely to die in a car accident than in such a terrorist attack ( even if they happened much more frequently ) . 
  such attacks inspire terror beyond the actual risk to any single citizen . 
  you really have to get unlucky . 
  do n't live a fearful live ; the boring ordinary risks ( heart disease , cars , skiing , etc. ), 
  are still much more likely to kill you . 
  if he was n't part of the organisation itself , he will know very little of value . 
  as a first language before english ? 
  oil price . 
  not sure why you are being downvoted , it 's true . 
  that said , the imbalance is so great that those effects wo n't save them if oil prices remain lowish . 
  how ? 
  no , you do n't . 
  but that is where a substantial part of the vocal opposition on this issue stems from ( again it does n't have to , but does to some degree ) .
