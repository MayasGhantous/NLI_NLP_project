  the strange thing is that so many people complain that the refugees are n't actual refugees but econmic migrants . 
  ( as in , sure , we 'd accept proper refugees , but no ... ) but when the wind turns it is all ... `` sure we are economic migrants , but we are skilled '' . 
  nobody said anything about * unskilled * abour . 
  ( at least the comic does n't ) . 
  that was just a jibe about economic migration . 
  sigh . 
  you can most certainly disagree with the current handling of the refugee crisis , but equating every refugee with a terrorist wo n't make anybody look at your point kindly . 
  most muslims even in countries with strong streaks of radical islamism mostly want to improve their own lives . 
  this is even more applicable to syrians ( who had a more secular streak than most ) and especially those going into the west . 
  will there be radicals among them ? 
  sure . 
  will it be many ? 
  how many ? 
  nobody knows , but it 'll be less than you have ordinary murderers in your own population ( if you run the numbers that is kind of obvious as the incoming is n't that large a percentage of the european population ) . 
  anywho ... less hatred , more constructive criticism ? 
  actual policy suggestions ? 
  the big problem with that is that they ca n't really say ` fuck you ' . 
  they 'd have to pay fines then , for being non-compliant with eu laws . 
  you can do that for a while , but in the long run the refugees would be the cheaper option . 
  meh , there have been plenty of stupid decisions before . 
  try not to be too apocalypic . 
  germany itself has absorbed millions of polish immigrants ( late 19th century ) , or hugenots ( before ) and is currently doing the same with turkish immigrants . 
  it takes a few decades , but by now few people even remember why there so many * wskis in the ruhr area of germany . 
  this is not the end of the world ( far from it ) . 
  as far as the actual cost to eu citizens ... the financial crisis is still the bigger issue ( and will remain so ) . 
  how often does it has to be said that germany does n't want an open-door immigration policy ? 
  but those opposed have to make actual suggestions what to do with asylum seekers that have arrived inside eu borders . 
  you ca n't just ignore them or dump the problem solely on greece . 
  what about being pro-not-being-anti-immgrant ? 
  ( i guess in poland just as in germany there are many people who do n't exactly like immigration but also do n't want to just abolish asylum , etc. ), 
  their best course of action is not to , because it is quite obvious that they would lose . 
  not doing anything means that it takes longer for the inevitable fines to be levied ( and as they are n't retroactive , but only start from the day that they are issued until the country complies with eu laws , the later the better ) . 
  so making a move is not exactly smart . 
  waiting is cheaper . 
  actually , you are wrong . 
  this applies to all countries ( eg . 
  a ruling by the constitutional court in germany on how the german constitution was to be interpreted got overruled by european courts ) . 
  from the perspective of european law ( and the european court system ) , eu law trumps even constitutional laws of member states . 
  whether the member states agree matters only insofar as they might be forced to leave if they want to keep their constitutional sovereignty ( or i guess they could keep paying fines for eternity while the european courts hold them in contempt ; the laws are n't enforced by anything than fines after all ) . 
  they kind of have to . 
  sure , they can travel to germany , but unless they fake an entirely new identity , they will not be given any kind of help here & be sent back . 
  it is not a new system ; that is how asylum seekers have been treated in the past when they were officially registered in a different country . 
  this crisis has kind of put a dent in the whole ( dublin ) system , but not because it isnt workable but only because the countries involved stopped wanting to apply it . 
  the actual people do n't get a vote . 
  if the countries involved agree upon the issue ( that is a big if , currently , obviously ) the individual person wo n't get a choice ( or only an illegal one ) . 
  obvious answer : a long term solution is not put in place ** because there is no agreement on one . 
  ** that does n't mean there are n't already tons of policy changes ( that have been done in the last few weeks/months ) where there was agreement ; you just do n't hear much about them because they are not controversial . 
  everybody agrees on a few basics ( like syrian refugees in lebanon need at least enough food not to starve ; more budget for border control ; trying to improve the situation in camps in the middle east ; etc. ), 
  where there has n't been much agreement ( and therefore no solution ) is with the critical issue of ... what to do with those refugees that manage to get here ? 
  italy/greece certainly do n't want to keep all of them . 
  countries that are n't immediate border countries ( and are also not destination counrties ) want them to either go back to where they originally arrived ( e.g. 
  greece ) or simply fly to germany , etc. . . 
  i think the major reason for their not being any progress is that too many people still hope that those refugees will stop coming ( which obviously is quite a weirdly delusional hope ) . 
  or if they come , that any solution might just involve everybody ** but ** them . 
  then there are those who just want to keep them out and think fences/walls will stop refugees ( in spite of all evidence to the contrary ) but you ** can not physically lock down a few thousand kilometers of border ** . 
  walls can be climbed , fences can be cut . 
  even east germany needed mines , patrols with machine guns , automated gun emplacements , etc. 
  and that was for a fairly small/short border . 
  the us/mexican border also wo n't ever stop immigration , people who are putting their money on steel/concret are just kidding themselves . 
  not on this issue , imho . 
  but i suppose we do n't agree . 
  children and spouses . 
  not distant cousins or nehpews . 
  i suspect that catalans - if the referendum were binding - would be more hesitant . 
  kind of like the scots shied away at the last minute when the general sentiment got in conflict with the nitty-gritty of coming to face with the actual reality of ` do we actually want to leave ' ? 
  ( i acknowledge that the last sentence is a shitty mess of a sentence . 
  i 'll leave it as it is to warn about improper use of a foreign language . ), 
  russia/ukraine is a european crisis , i guess , though with somewhat wider geopolitical implications ... but it is ** not ** a european union crisis . 
  it has shit all to do with the eu . 
  ( it does n't directly involve any eu member , nor is their much internal disagreement on the issue . 
  at the most , the eastern european eu members are feeling that the other members , while on the right side , do n't emphasize the issue enough . 
  basically , the disagreement - as much as there is one - is on the amount of shits given , not on the issues involved . ), 
  yeah , because that actually happened . 
  stating that asylum seekers will be treated according to our laws ( based on our western values ) ... 
  we wo n't mind keeping the biggest share , no ( even adjusted for population , except sweden probably ) . 
  we do kind of mind being treated as imbeciles for trying to hold up basic western values like not treating/calling out asylum seekers & refugees as scum . 
  we do kind of mind people lying constantly to shift the narrative ( like claming that the majority of incoming people are economic migrants , which is demonstrably untrue ) . 
  we kind of mind people twisting their proposed solutions one way or the other depending on where they are from ( border countries : help us , we can not bear the burden alone ; eastern european countries : send them back to the first countries they arrived at , etc ) ; then balking when you are trying to find a solution that at least kind of works for everybody . 
  we do kind of mind people freaking out as if doomsday is on the horizon , while this is mostly about unfounded cultural fears and money ( that will have to be spent ) . 
  some people use the phrase as ` world is ending ' while others use it as ` things are n't as they are supposed to be/orderly ' . 
  i can agree with the ` spiraling out of control ' or disagree , depending on how this wildly inaccurate phrase is meant to be understood . 
  there certainly is a certain amount of disorder in the current managment of refugees ( mostly on the inter-european level ; but also some in individual countries , incl . 
  germany ) , but the situation will not `` end the eu '' or `` collapse european societies '' or `` blow up in more violance than europe has seen in decades '' ( and similiar doomsday predictions ) . 
  you are either delusional or just spouting off . 
  you know that your chance to go anywhere but your tent city in turkey is about 0.01 % . 
  and those refugee camps in lebanon & neighbouring countries ( except turkey , atm ) are having serious trouble getting enough food and medicine . 
   the only thing they could decide on at this point is completely sealing the outer borders that does n't work though . 
  ask the us ( or just look at all those european borders ) . 
  you can not physically lock down a few thousands kilometrs of border . 
  walls can be climbed , fences can be cut . 
  even east germany needed mines , patrols with machine guns , automated gun emplacements , etc. 
  and that was for a fairly small/short border . 
  meh , germany is less effected by that than most other western countries . 
  even china can not really undercut the german exporting industries , as they usually tend to not compete on price ( buy have niches where they are the only one competing at that level of quality , etc. ) . 
  or , put otherwise , most countries * want * or * need * to buy these products and can not really bar entry totally . 
  cars may be the exception , but while well known , the other export products tend to be in less competetive markets ( specialized machinery , industrial process tech & similiar ) . 
  mind you , i am not advocating such a `` piss off '' - stance , just pointing out that the cards you are suggesting to be played might not be as strong as you think . 
  why are people overdramatizing these event ? 
  for the czech republic , this means a few thousand asylum seekers . 
  ( or one syrian ( +20 % sth else ) for three or four thousand czech . ),
