  unless you specifically work in the field , you wo n't even notice . 
  that is true . 
  quite . 
  but people usually only want those political structures that benefit them ( or where they expect a benefit ) . 
  principals go down very fast when faced with `` not in my backyard '' - issues . 
   here foreigner means danger that sounds like you have a problem ... with your rather generalized prejuidice . 
  the csu is part of the ruling coalition . 
  big financial center plus misguided austerity policies . 
  unless i get republican tradition or a stab gain out of it , no deal . 
  it should be said that i have recently seen a good number of sockpuppet accounts ( or sth ) that have only a few comments in only one thread on / r/worldnews and / r/europe . 
  not sure if there is a connection , but those two subreddits seem to be targeted by propagandists ( of actually varying stripes ) . 
  it seems the ratio of much more readers on reddit than commenters/voters makes it attractive for sockpuppetry and astroturfing . 
  very little effort and you get hunrdes of thousands of eyballs reading your propaganda . 
  the irony of the selfish future migrant complaining about migration ... * i think it is lost on him * . 
  what industry / field do you work in ? 
  ( cause that should n't be the norm , unless there are safety reasons . 
  i have seen plenty of efficient but unsafe procedures abroad . ), 
  where are you from ? 
  if you are a eu citizen ... skip the arabic and just move here . 
  learn german instead . 
  welcome . 
  maybe they have enough of people taking up arms and making new countries ? 
  * they got plenty of that were they came from ; that 's why they are on the road in the first place . 
  * maybe they are just looking for the best place for themselves to settle down ? 
  * as people have done throughout history . 
  is she supposed not to state the facts clearly ? . 
  * people around here seem to want her to scare away refugees . 
  * cause my pleasant europe , got to share now . 
  estonia itself has plenty russian spies imprisoned . 
  so a swap does n't seem to unlikely . 
  [ educational ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsxme8h6iyc ), 
  import greeks before germany gets them all . 
  well ... except for the people in the middle east & africa , lying dead in their graves . 
  siberia is huge . 
  it covers a broad range of climates . 
  so the question is ... where in siberia are we talking about exactly ? 
  ( besides , even ` typical ' siberia is pretty warm in the summer - continental climate ) . 
  got to love it . 
  you are wrong . 
  of course imports also rise in price , but as any business usually operates by adding value ... i 'll let you work out the logic . 
  yes . 
  they are quite important for keeping their economy supplied with foreign currency as well . 
  i am not sure i 'll take a guy citing r&r ( who have a bone in this bigger than they should and with [ some credibility lost ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-excel-depression.html?ref=paulkrugman&amp;_r=1 ) ) over the imf and other economists . 
  the big difference , btw , to all these other countries he mentions is that they had their own currency . 
  you can deal with high debt loads if you can inflate away some of those debt . 
  but greece ca n't . 
  it is a very different situation if you are hard-pegged to another currency that is n't inflating at all ( or not much ) . 
  so your solution is a delayed grexit ( worse for everybody ) ? 
  are you hoping for a miracle ? 
  greek ** can not ** pay back its debts . 
  i 'll leave out the question of how we got there ( guilt ) ... but just sticking your head in the sand wo n't make the problem go away . 
  no debt relief does n't mean the debt will be payed back , how difficult is it to understand that ? 
  i do n't even really care what your politics about this are , but the first step is always accepting reality and not denying it . 
  then you can work within reality to achieve whatever goal you desire . 
  and your solution would be ? 
  pray for a miracle ? 
  true . 
   1 ) not really . 
  argentina is still paying it . 
  that was a choice because argentine wanted to preserve better access to future loans . 
  so they negotiated a haircut with ( most ) creditors . 
  a country * can * default on its entire debt , if it is willing to bear the consequences ( possible seizure of assets in foreign countries ... usually not a big issue & difficulty in convincing future creditors to loan you money ... a bigger issue ) . 
   leaving the ez pretty much guarantees leaving the eu on the long run . 
  the only countries within the eu with no plan to get to ez are those with strong economies . 
  so - yeah - a grexit implies an exit from eu as well ( on the shorter or longer run ) ... 
  i do n't see that . 
  there are economically weaker countries in the eu that havent yet joined the ez ( though they want to and likely will in the future ) ; i do n't see why there could n't be an economically weaker economy that is n't part of the ez nor wants to ( or is wanted to be ... ) . 
  do you think greece would be expelled from the eu ? 
  if not , why do you think they would want to leave ? 
  the advantage of a grexis it twofault . 
  1 ) they get rid of the debt . 
  ( by defaulting ) no longer paying for interest ( though they do n't pay * much * for interest atm ) ; this is a rather long-term thing . 
  at the moment not getting further credit would be worse than not paying interest is good . 
  2 ) the biggie : they can devalue their new currency . 
  right now they are trying to cut prices & wages , which is very difficult to do ( downward price/wage rigidity ) . 
  by being able to set their own monetary policy again they could devalue their currency to boost tourism & exports , while discouraging imports . 
  also , i am not saying leave the european union , grexit means leaving the euro/eurozone/eurogroup . 
  nobody means exit from the european union on top of that . 
  honestly , grexit & default would be better for greece in the long run . 
  it is just the first 6months that would be seriously shitty . 
  he has a much better track record than most . 
  remember all these economists claiming that quantative easing , etc. 
  would lead to high/runaway inflation ? 
  have you checked the current interest levels recently ? 
  his knowledeg of european politics has always been shoddy ( though it seemed to improve recently ) . 
  his economic predictions are much better than most , though . 
  as much as i dislike sch\u00e4uble and his policies ... that is actually true . 
  it would be pretty much the same to simply state the trust is part of the german government . 
  whether you think that improves the optics of the situation ... but it is n't a personal money-grab ; just germany saying ` we trust ourselves to keep your stuff more than we trust you ' ( which obviously raises questions about sovereignty as well as whether this is a europe/greece issue or germany/greece ( europe ? ) ) . 
  the kfw is basically just a bank run by the german government ; sch\u00e4uble does n't personally benefit ; but this is indeed the german government taking over assets of the no longer sovereign nation of greece . 
  i am not seeing this . 
  this show is backed into a corner so hard that even with best intentions its now pretty difficult to avoid a grexit . 
  if merkel & sch\u00e4uble honestly didnt want a grexit ( and there are plenty indications , and statements by multiple people indicating otherwise ) then they 'd have to change course months ago . 
  at least the rest of europe is n't too far off , we are all taking a bath in the styx . 
  ( though obviously you 'd be hit much harder . ), 
  honestly , i have no idea what sch\u00e4ubles actual plan is . 
  i do n't think he sees a workable solution ; or has in years . 
  maybe .

  this is different than argentine , pegged to the dollar .
