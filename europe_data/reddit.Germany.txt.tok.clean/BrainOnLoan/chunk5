  besides , they could n't `` demand '' higher interest rates . 
  you either take them as they are , or do n't . 
  and enough people took them for greek not to have to offer bonds at higher rates . 
  not sure if sarcasm or not . 
   the greek economy was actually growing before syriza came to power . 
  all sides expected that the growth would increase to 3.7 percent until 2016 and that greece was entering of growth an relief . 
  the reality probably would n't have been quite that bright , but all indicators pointed in that general direction . 
  how often were there predictions like that ? 
  in no way would that have been the result , especially as there were demands for further cuts . 
  apparently you do think that greece would have been able to pay back its debts . 
  if that is the case we are n't actually arguing policy . 
  the root of our disagreement would then be economics . 
  you think it would have actually been possible for greece to service its debts ; i think that is a fantasy . 
   but do n't sell it as an achievement on behalf of syriza because it is n't . 
  if they really wanted a grexit , they could have forced it months ago when greece was in a better position than they are now . 
  if they would have been serious about a grexit , they would have negotiated a proposal months ago , let their people decide on it and - in case of a vote against the proposal - quit the negotiations and prepare the grexit . 
  i am not sellling it as an achievement of syriza ; just as a necessity that should have happened long ago and really should n't have been deferred any longer . 
  there is btw the problem that you can not officially prepare for grexit ; it automatically leads to a bank run ( or very tight , but probably failing , capital controls ) . 
  sure , you can try to plan it secretly , but as soon as the cat is out of the bag , you 'd better do it immediately . 
  this not something you can negotiate over . 
  grexit automatically means default and euros still virtually inside the greek economy will be exchanged into new drachme ( which nobody wants , therefore bank runs ) . 
  i actually agree with the gambling part ; and refer to what i already wrote : ' * i have no idea whether their chosen negotiating and exit - strategy was a smart idea . 
  i suspect it was not . 
  they may have actually thought the creditors would yield to some extent and accept a small primary surplus ( that greece has achieved ) & cutting enough debt that it would be workable . 
  if so , i think they miscalculated politically . 
  it seems apparent to me that such a thing was never on the table . 
  * ' knowing that and going back in time , i would probably have negotiated a bit more tactfully - with the same sort of demands , though ( which i suspect the `` troika '' would not have accepted however much tact employed ) while secretly doing my best to prepare for grexit . 
  i still would have gone the way of referendum ; declare your intentions , declare a bank holiday , ask the greek people whether they want grexit/default or the cuts demanded by the creditors ( while stating that i do n't believe that path would actually be succesful ) . 
  if the referendum goes grexit , you implement your secretly planned exit-strategy ( hopefully you got a huge bundle of printed notes stashed away ; though i doubt that could be done in secret , actually ) . 
  if the referendum goes contra-grexit , you resign and the opposition ( first minority government , then new elections ) would have to implement the same old stuff , hoping it works this time . 
  as far as the timing of the referendum goes ... 
  i do n't think it matters , frankly , aside from diplomatic curtesy . 
  the differences were too big ; what would a compromise have looked like ? 
  the offer on the table looked like another `` we 'll meet again in two years ; with more debt and the same problem '' . 
  but that may be my perspective ; do you actually think there could have been a workable middle-ground ? 
  quitting the eurogroup and going bankrupt are pretty much connected . 
  they might have just defaulted or they might have said `` our euro debts are now new-drachme debts '' ( and defaulted via devaluing their currency ) but ... they would have had to go bankrupt . 
  the primary surplus comes automatically then . 
   because in that scenario , without anybody giving you loans , you can only pay out in new drachme what you can take in in taxes . 
  -- most of the reforms they did was straight cutting of expenses combined with loosening their labor laws so wages could be cut . 
  the second one would be solved with devaluing your new drachme . 
  there wouldnt be as much need to loosen labour laws . 
  the cuts you 'd still have to do . 
  essentially you have to balance your budget from one day to the next ( because for some time you wo n't be borrowing much money ) . 
  so the initial slump ( via drastic austerity ) would have been quite real . 
  but i still maintain that the years thereafter would have been better . 
  it would just frontload most of the austerity they had to do anyway ; out of necessity instead of being forced to by their creditors . 
  but at least they 'd be in a better situation to deal with it ( by lowering wages/prices with monetary policy instead of trying to actually lower nominal wages/prices , which is damn difficult ) . 
  not really . 
  all those years they could n't run a different monetary policy ( which they desperately needed ) . 
  devaluing your own currency raises your competitveness ( international trade ) , while cutting prices/wages across the board ( theoretically the same thing ) is basically impossible ( downward nominal wage rigidity ) . 
  the initial shock would have been greater , but they would have already had five years to recover ; under a fairly normal loose-monetary policy ( normal for their situation ) . 
  only recently . 
  six years ago , they had huge deficits . 
  i have said over and over again that greece is at fault for getting themselves into the mess . 
  but the delusion that `` have to fix their own mess '' was an even remote possibility is what caused more harm and what i was talking about . 
  six years ago it was already obvious that it was a problem of a magnituted that greece could n't dig themselves out of it however much they tried . 
  they should been forced to grexit ( and default ) then . 
  but everbody tried to save the day . 
  that was the mistake . 
  it was n't solvable anymore . 
  the only options were bailout or default . 
  for some weird reason we chose mini-bailout that was n't even close to enough to solve the issue plus waiting around for six years so that the inevitable default becomes even worse . 
  that is the lunacy i was writing about . 
  i do not disagree with your notion that most of the fault for greece getting into trouble is theirs in the first place . 
  they did n't see the money coming back . 
  greek could fund its expenses with its revenue , but it would never have been able to pay back those debts , or even to pay fair ( market based ) interest rates . 
  it was obvious from the getgo that the ` substantial ' haircut was insufficient . 
  as i said , greece will not , could not pay back its debts . 
  plants along those lines were fantasty . 
  which is why i say they should have gone the route of default/grexit six or seven years ago . 
  ( the only alternative would be a more substantial bailout of greece , which probably was politically non-viable ) . 
  greece had barely managed a primary surplus and meagre gdp growth ... but that was deemed insufficient by the creditor nations . 
  that is the whole point . 
  they demanded more ( severe ) cuts . 
  they wanted a primary surplus of more than 4 or 5 % of gdp , which imho is unreachable with more cuts ( as you 'd drop back into another recession ) . 
  sorry , but the amount of debt accrued by greece and their potential economy is simply too large . 
  which somehow nobody wants to admit . 
  but even if you reformed all the kinks out of the greek system ... it wo n't work . 
  default/grexit it is and should have been six years ago . 
  and every time they had unworkable assumptions about how much the asked for cuts would depress the greek economy . 
  and after every round of such cuts , the greek budget again fell short . 
  not because they hadnt cut the asked for amount , but because they had entered another deep recession . 
  nobody ever admitted that the gap between the debt accrued by greece ( their fault ) and their potential economy to pay it back was way to big . 
  but nobody ever admitted that ; the creditors still pay hommage to the mirage that somehow greece can pay back the current amount of debts ( after some small haircuts ) if they just cut their expenses another time . 
  their economic models are simply out of whack with reality . 
  i 've written in more detail [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bb4e3/afp_says_greeces_request_for_an_extension_has/csknsl7 ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bb4e3/afp_says_greeces_request_for_an_extension_has/cskr30g ), 
  oh , i am absolutely aware that their last proposals were bullshitting for all they were worth . 
  the problem is that they were asked for something they could not deliver . 
  creditors were demanding plans on grounds that were ... obviously untenable . 
  greece could not pay back their debts on the grounds that were demanded/offered . 
  it as bit like asking your doctor to finally give you a detailed proposal for curing your cancer , and demanding that it exclude chemotherapy and surgery , but should include dietary changes , homeopathy and a star chart . 
  you should n't be surprised if the plan you get back is full of bs , you were essentially asking for it . 
  sure , greece could have come back with 5 % of gdp cuts for real . 
  the creditors would have been delighted ; ` now everything will work out fine ( we 've been down that road a few times ) . ', 
  then in one or two years they would have been surprised that greece 's economy tanked again , so that you got maybe another 0.5 % gdp primary surplus more in effect . 
  then the whole thing would have started over again . 
  essentially , if the creditors were not interested in bailing out greece ( ** which is understandable ** , imho ) , ** they should have pushed for a grexit ( & default ) six years ago ** . 
  they did n't . 
  they promised everybody that greece would stay in the eurozone ; they 'd make it work somehow .
