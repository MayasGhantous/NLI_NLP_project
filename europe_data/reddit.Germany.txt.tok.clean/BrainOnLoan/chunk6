  it is the ** how ** they never got around to . 
  their initial ideas failed ( see next paragraph ) and after that they never came up with a plan that was supposed to do anything more than kick the ball down the road another year or two . 
  initially they demanded austerity ( a certain amount of budget cuts ) and actually promised that would spur growth because it would restore confidence - aka the [ confidence fairy ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/the-greek-stand-by-arrangement/ ) . 
  or so some said . 
  others disagreed . 
  then it was actually tried . 
  the sceptics won . 
  they results were n't even close to the original plan even though the greek governments of yesteryear actually did as asked . 
  the imf at least has by now admitted that their initial plans were doomed to fail . 
  the eu by and large hasnt . 
  ( neither have they provided an explanation for why it failed , even though greece did as asked/forced to ) . 
  that game was actually repeated a few times with the same result every time . 
  `` oh , you need to cut your spending * this much * , this time it 'll work . '', 
  cue another round of deeply negative gdp growth ( and therefore tanking revenue ) , ... oh , it does n't seem to have worked . 
  * * facepalm * * by now the total amount of budget cuts way exceeded what was initially supposed to be enough . 
  greece actually * has * cut expenses significantly ; but it didnt work . 
  ** it could n't work ** ; because the gulf between the debt greece had accrued ( their fault ) and their potential economy to pay it back was way to big . 
  but nobody ever admitted that ; the creditors still pay hommage to the mirage that somehow greece can pay back the current amount of debts ( after some small haircuts ) if they just cut their expenses another time . 
  the amount of cuts currently demanded would certainly depress the greek economy so deeply ( again ) that they still would n't be able to pay back the debt . 
  ( or pay full interests ) . 
  by now , creditors demands ca n't be taken seriously as they obviously cant long-term solve the problem . 
  it is kind of difficult to work with such demands in any realistic fashion . 
  nobody seems to be interest anymore in a solution beyond avoiding the current crisis and having peace for a few months . 
  what is the greek government supposed to do ? 
  go into another round of this old-same-old-scheme ? 
  the only way they have , imho , is default/grexit . 
  how to exactly go into this ... difficult . 
  i have no idea whether their chosen negotiating and exit - strategy was a smart idea . 
  i suspect it was not . 
  they may have actually thought the creditors would yield to some extend and accept a small primary surplus ( that greece has achieved ) & cutting enough debt that it would be workable . 
  if so , i think they miscalculated politically . 
  it seems apparent to me that such a thing was never on the table . 
  the creditors were either aiming for a grexit themselves or had delluded themselves into the idea they could somehow turn this around ( private creditors mind you had n't ; they had seen the writing on the wall way back when , but almost no private creditors hold greek debt anymore ; only european governments/ecb ) . 
  but what options did the greek government have now ? 
  another round of cuts ; then back again in 18 months with a slightly higher debt ? 
  sure , greece is responsible for getting themselves into this mess . 
  but greece ** is not responsible ** for this whole mess tearing itself apart now the way it is instead of six years ago ( which would have been better for all parties involved ) . 
  the creditors could have been merciful ( again , probably undeserved if you take the long view back ) , and they promised they would be but never made good on that promise . 
  in that case , again , they should have gone down the road of ** `` better end early in misery , rather than a misery without end '' ** . 
  i have had a simliar feeling . 
  though , honestly , if that is all what they had in mind ; that was basically accomplished after two years or so . 
  they still dragged it out way beyond that point even . 
  they did n't need six years for that . 
  i could see 6 months to silently prepare for a more or less ordered default/grexit . 
  but they surely didnt go for that . 
  again , greece got itself into an untenable situation and are themselves at fault for that . 
  that is true . 
  but i have no idea what plan the creditors had in mind for the last six years ... because it was impossible for greece to get a large enough primary surplus to pay back their debts . 
  if they did n't want to bail out greece , then it would have been much cheaper for everybody to just go for a default & grexit six or sevens years ago instead of dragging it all out . 
  what was the point of the last six years ? 
  they never provided a solution that could work . 
  it was only always about pushing out the inevitable another two years . 
  which is stupid . 
  it is objectively worse now , though . 
  it would have been cheaper back then . 
  maybe it was n't politically viable , because it needed to sink into people 's minds ... but i dislike arguments from human irrationality . 
  * ` oh sure , this would be better policy , but if we wait a few years it 'll be worse but it 'll be easier to make it happen then . 
   but if you mean in a way of a debt cut there is no way that would have happened and gambling on that would happen otherwise is quite questionnable . 
  but then the whole six years were obviously wasted . 
  everybody knew greece couldnt service all that debt . 
  if that was the creditor 's intent ... again , justifiable in the first place ... they really should have called it quits years ago . 
  they just made it worse . 
  without a debt cut , there was no credible path to avoid greece defaulting ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't see it . 
  i have n't seen an actual willingness to compromise by the creditors for years . 
  i would have called it quits years ago ( and silently prepared default/grexit ) . 
  but it would have been just worse in two years . 
  if creditors were n't willing to bail out greece ( understandable , as greece got itself into that mess ) they should have pushed for default & grexit years ago . 
  but they promised to keep greece inside of the eurozone . 
  but creditors never opened up a viable path . 
  i do n't see how greek politicians were supposed to avoid either defaulting or worsening their situation year , after year , with no end in sight but an even worse default/grexit . 
  sure , greek politicians of the nineties and 2000s are at fault for getting greece into that mess ( debt so high they could never service it ) . 
  but in the last six to seven years ... no . 
  the situation was unsolvable . 
  it required either a ) a bailout b ) default & grexit . 
  if creditors were n't willing to seriously work on the second solution ( which is justifiable , moral hazard , etc ) , then they should have said so and pushed for an as well as can be ordered default & grexit . 
  they didnt do that . 
  they promised that they 'd keep greece inside the eurozone . 
  but they never open a viable path for that . 
  never . 
  i do n't see what greek politicians of the last six years could have done to avoid default , honestly . 
  their negotiation tactics where shit , i give you that . 
  but creditors were demanding plans on grounds that were ... obviously insufficient . 
  it as bit like asking your doctor to finally give you a detailed proposal for curing your cancer , and demanding that it did n't exclude chemotherapy and surgery , but should include dietary changes , homeopathy and a star chart . 
  creditors demands could n't be taken seriously as they obviously could n't long-term solve the problem . 
  it is kind of difficult to work with such demands in a realistic fashion . 
  oh sure , they did have short - and mid-term plans . 
  they never put forward a solution that would n't lead to the next deadline-based crisis , though . 
  i think this was part of the plan . 
  to get european banks off the hook ( and put european taxpayers on it ) . 
  that even back then everybody who knew what they were talking about called out as too small . 
  either decide you do n't want to bail them out ( moral hazard ) ... then they should have cut the line six/seven years ago . 
  or put forward workable solutions ( which they did n't ) . 
  essentially creditors were luring greece with promises into an even more messy present . 
  sure , greece was at fault for getting into the mess . 
  but for the past six years ... the creditors have made much more bullshit moves then greek politicians . 
  barely . 
  ( as you can see i knew that when you look at the paragraph starting '' * after greece had reached a primary surplus ... * '' ) . 
  i do n't know how they should have gotten another five percent gdp surplus .
