  ( 5 % gdp cuts ... no . 
  as you 'd lose revenue by tanking the economy further . 
  they 'd have to reach levels of ufunding their government that nobody ever tried to reach . ), 
  he is n't actually at fault , you know ? 
  blame the greek politicians of the nineties and 2000s . 
  the current situation was unworkable for anybody . 
  the creditors `` solution '' would have just pushed the problem down the road for another two years ... and it would have been worse then . 
  i ca n't really fault the greek government for saying ... `` okay , we are now in this mess ; offer us a solution that works ( none ever put forward , as it required debt relief/haircut ) or we 'll just have to call it quits '' . 
  sure greece as a whole is at fault for getting into that high amount of debt , but currently ... they made more sense than the creditors . 
  the truth is that it was n't just greece/syriza that led to the disaster . 
  sure , greece was the party ( mostly ) at fault for actually running up the debt so high in the first place . 
  ** i am all for blaming the greek politicians of the nineties and 2000s ** . 
  and maybe blame all people involved in setting up a common currency ... when all of the eurozone was not an optimal currency area . 
  but in the last few years ... 
  i ca n't really fault greek politicians . 
  what were they supposed to do ? 
  their debt was too high to be paid back . 
  everbody knew that . 
  huge cuts led to a huge slump in gdp , which meant that it did n't lead to the budgetary outcome promised by the eu/imf . 
  ( which at least the imf is now admitting . ) . 
  basically , the last few years have been wasted . 
  because the solutions people offically were working on were untenable . 
  they could n't have been effective ( except for delaying the inevitable ) . 
  but every delay just made the problem worse . 
  after greece had reached a primary surplus ... they could have gone for a haircut / debt relief . 
  that would have lessened the pain ( for everybody ) somewhat . 
  but they wanted even more of a primary surplus ... how ? 
  it is absolutely unheard of to reach a primary surplus of more than 4 or 5 % of gdp in a such dismal state of an economy . 
  how was that supposed to work ? 
  ** the current demands by the creditor side essentially meant just a few more years delay . 
  ** with the same problem reappearing down the road , ** just worse ** . 
  with an even more depressed greek economy . 
  with debt that was even higher ( nominally , as the primary surplus was n't sufficient to pay all interest , as low as it was ) . 
  so what exactly was the creditors ( merkels ? ), 
  end-game ? 
  wait until some other politician was in charge , probably . 
  if their goal was default + grexit they could have had that years ago ... with somewhat less unpleasant results . 
  so what where they actually trying to accomplish those last few years ? 
  it does n't look to me as if they were actually trying to put forward a workable solution , because i sure never heard one being put forward . 
  if somebody wants krugman 's perspective : [ breaking greece ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/breaking-greece/ ) mind you , i 've heard few economists saying otherwise ( outside of the german finance ministry and bundesbank ) . 
  their offered solution was n't a serious one either . 
  if creditors decided ( justifiably , i guess , moral hazard and so on ) not to accept debt relief ; that they did n't want to `` reward '' greece for it 's spending of the ninenties and 2000s ... then they should have made that clear six years ago . 
  greek default and grexit back then would have been prefarable . 
  but they promised that they 'd keep greece in the eurozone ... but apparently never wanted to do what was required . 
  again ... then they should n't have gone down that road . 
  the truth is that it was n't just greece that led to the disaster . 
  sure , greece was the party ( mostly ) at fault for actually running up the debt so high in the first place .

  we all knew greece would n't pay back the full debt they owed . 
  that was basically impossible ( requiring essentially a primary surplus of six percent or more ) . 
  what was required -- years ago -- was either a substantial ` haircut ' ( more like writing of half of their debt or a bit more ) or a default ( probably including grexit ) . 
  and it would have been better for anybody involved if it had happened years ago . 
  now its probably going to be default + grexit . 
  which we could have had years ago with less drama and less pain for all sides . 
  what was actually needed was either a substantial haircut on the debt or a default ( probably with grexit ) . 
  there simply was no way greece was going to pay back its current debt . 
  they would have had to reach sth . 
  like six percent primary surplus which is unheard of . 
  that article is mostly correct . 
  greece paying back all that it ows is a fantasy and clinging to it will just worsen the outcome . 
  nature got nice looking stones/gravel for you . 
  and rightly so . 
  ( being german ), 
  not * equally * corrupt , just * also * corrupt . 
  huh . 
  til, 
  true . 
  i do n't see a problem . 
  what has n't worked ? 
  i do n't want adjustments to increase the birth rate ; i meant adjustments to a shrinking population . 
  it can go on a long time like that before humanity will die out . 
  so far , i am not seeing a big problem , just a trend that requires some adjustments ( that are quite possible ) . 
  no , and i do n't really see why it is supposed to be a problem either .
