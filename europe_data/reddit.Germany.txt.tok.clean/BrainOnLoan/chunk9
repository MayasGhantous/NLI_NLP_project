  sure , arrivals in australia dropped . 
  but they are now shepherded elsewhere that is n't australia proper ... under very poor conditions . 
  they 've just moved the problem where people ca n't see . 
  out of sight , out of mind . 
  maybe ? 
  i get the creeps reading / r/europe / whenever it gets somewhat political . 
  very much this . 
  and we do a good deal to contribute to that ; mostly trade rules and agricultural subsidies . 
  unless you mean those staying illegally . 
  but for asylum it does n't work like that . 
  if you are first processed in italy , back to italy you go . 
  i prefer higher inflation . 
  ( 3-5 % ) but that is still essentially a transfer from creditors to debtors . 
   not all eu countries are part of the ` euro experiment ' . 
  neither are all schengen zone countries members of the eu . 
      as such i fail to see what bearing either of these two factors have to do with anything . 
  i am aware of that . 
  i thought your question `` for argument 's sake , ... '' was getting to the heart of the matter of `` why at all ? 
  and maybe why this way ? '', 
  ... a question about political priorities and morals . 
  your portrayal of my position is ... taking it too far . 
  reread my comment , please . 
  migration ( and schengen ) was a side-issue . 
  i am actually more interested in the economic reasoning ( which mostly applies to the euro-zone ) and the political reasons ( which are much more open to opinion and discussion of values and not perfectly rational ) . 
  the economic issues can be analyzed rationally though . 
  and in this matter i was n't talking about ` blackmail ' or some other game-theory reasoning ( though those can be interesting ) , but simply stating that some fiscal transfers can be economically beneficial ( net-positive financially ) even for those countries * who pay * . 
  germany reaping huge benefits from the common currency as an export oriented economy ... so it has great interests in keeping it -  which might mean taking haircuts on southern european sovereign debts , etc. 
  the same goes for the uk which is reaping huge dividends from its position as the financial centre of the european union and is bound to lose quite a bit if being forced out of the european union ( in whatever fashion ) . 
  there is a reason the city is strongly opposed to such a move . 
  ** it pays for the uk to be in the european union ** , however much a naive weights and scales approach will show otherwise ( mostly due to the fact that this is n't a zero-sum game ; econ policy does n't just move stuff around , at times it grows the whole pie ) . 
  pre or post euro ? 
  the euro-zone needs some amount of fiscal transfers or it would n't even be close to an [ optimum currency area ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) , which atm it obviously is n't ( but the greater the disparency , the greater the drawbacks of a common currency ; to the point where the disadvantages outweigh the advantages -- it can actually be ecnomoically beneficial for the stronger economy to transfer wealth so as to keep a common currency going , which lends benefits ... arguably a position germany is in right now ) . 
  without a common currency , the argument is mainly political . 
  are you willing to give up some of your wealth for the greater ( common ) good ? 
  also to lessen migration pressures within the schengen area . 
  by your logic , there are plenty of other nations that should get rebates . 
  or rather , there should n't be any netcontributors ( therefore no net-recipients ) . 
  so , what remains ? 
  you want the european union to have no budget ? 
  you want it to get revenues from the citizens directly and not the member states ? 
  ** no ** ... you probably just want to keep your rebates and argue with net-recipients , all the while trying to ignore the other net-contributors who do not have ( nor demand ) rebates . 
  this is a shared endevour - and you do n't want to leave entirely - but you want your cake and only pay half the price because other people ( who have less than you ) get food-stamps . 
  which you do n't need . 
  so you make a grandstanding argument , while those in line behind you who might have even better arguments just want you to get your act together so they can pay for their cake full-prize because that is the right thing to do if they want to shop in that particular co-op . 
  yeah , that ai n't my experience . 
  but pakistan ( at least some regions ) is one of the worst places you could draw your immigrants from . 
  blackwater place in history , essentially hundreds of years in the past ( as saudi arabia would be without oil money ; still is in some ways ; just rich ) quite different from iran/persia for example ; persian exiles around the world are usually a boon ; cultured and educated . 
  north africa ai n't too bad either , certainly better than the arabian peninsula ( again , money/oil does help some ) southeast asia and indonesia ? 
  totally different culturally . 
  turkey ? 
  mixed bag . 
  uncultured farmers in the backwater regions , but quite cultured western/urban population with strong secular & modern traditions ( internally contested ) . 
  ** tl/dr : ** different countries / cultures of origin matter . 
  they usually are much more predictive than just * ` muslim ' * . 
  lebanese christians/muslims are more similar to each other than their christians to western europeans or their muslims to muslims in malacca ( majority muslim ) . 
  hmm , i know gay muslims who still got friends and family . 
  that said , this is in germany and that article said specifically that they found british muslims to be worse than their french and german counterparts . 
  probably more due to the countries they came from ( e.g. 
  pakistan vs. algeria vs. turkey/bosnia ; those are very different origins , even though muslim all of them ), 
  well , most of these 10 % will be neither vocal nor radical . 
  ( even though some of them will . ), 
  his kingship dig actually sounds quite interesting . 
  i suspect wife and children have more to do with keeping him put . 
  ( gabriele also sounds like it could be the name of a german woman , so maybe she does n't want to move ) . 
  is n't that better than piling on the damage ? 
  should n't we all be in favor of controlling and mitigating damage , trying to make the best out of the ( and every ) situation ? 
  nor were they in the fifties or seventies , then ( well , family policy , yes ; but not on refugee issues ) . 
  the current afd party manifesto is way to the right of german conservative party policies fifty years ago . 
  merkel definitely has populist streaks ( as have many successful politicians ) . 
  depends on the country , obviously . 
  they 'd be main-stream conservative in hungary or the southern united states . 
  they are n't even close to typical german conservatives , though . 
  if you boild down the debate in germany to immigration , then the polls are pretty clear . 
  there is a strong minority that is opposed to the current policies ( significant overlap with afd voters ) , but a majority is in favour ( but obviously split between traditional parties , as in cdu/spd/greens ) . 
  afd/pegida etc do represent a significant slice of the population , but they are not a `` silent majority '' . 
  if they put their policies up for an up/down vote , they 'd lose ( and it wouldnt be that close ) . 
  most people voting for them are n't that well off ( and would probably hate their economic policies if implemented ) . 
  most afd voters would disagree strongly with much of that platform , especially the economic parts ( and the female voters with a lot of the social stuff , i guess ) ... if they knew about it . 
  it was mostly an anti-establishment vote by those who feel ( or actually have been ) left behind ( poor , unemplyoed , underpriviliged , etc. ), 
  they were pretty decent on that front in the distant past ( so before the early eighties ) . 
  the afd would never agree . 
  ( nor would it be offered . ), 
  there is no common policy ground they could agree on . 
  usually , the next such election will see the afd losing seats . 
  as they get much more seats quickly than usual , a lot of the backbenchers are weirdos that just got lucky with a parliament seat . 
  those kind of groupings have a tendancy to splinter and fight amongst themselves ( at least it has happened often in the past ) . 
  i 'll give you that . 
  have you seen the conditions in turkey/lebanon ? 
  or are you referring to greece & the balkan states ? 
  ( who must have seemed very welcoming ) i am actually in favor of a more sensible distribution within the eu ( though only with consent , obviously , i do n't want to stoke the anti-refugee anger any more than it already has been ) . 
  also , have you tried putting yourself in their position ? 
  what would you do ? 
  spend the next few years in underfunded tent cities in turkey in , frankly , very poor conditions ? 
  ( and yes , i agree that the unhcr needs more funds to house refugees in lebanon/turkey , and yes , it would be very nice if israel and the arab states would also do the right thing and contribute ... which they wont most likely ), 
  refugees and asylum rules are not about immigration or skilled labour . 
  first and foremost , they are about a safe haven for people in need . 
  the next steps years thereafter ( if they could go back , do they have to ? ), 
  is when those kind of questions become relevant . 
  because we tried for years . 
  and even billions of dollars , walls , fences , mines and ships can not truly stop refugees .
