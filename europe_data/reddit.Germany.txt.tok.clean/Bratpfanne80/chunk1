so russia has finally adopted western foreign policy tactics . 
  i ca n't blame them . 
  muslim immigration in western europe is n't exactly a success story so why would they want to make the same mistakes ? 
  he 's wrong . 
  europa is * a subcontinent * a moon orbiting jupiter * zeus ' mistress he should not confuse europe with the european union . 
   why does the government not listen its citizens because democracy does not mean that the government has to follow public opinion at all times . 
  most germans agree with you on this . 
  we do n't want our soldiers in turkey . 
  another good one is [ wer fr\u00fcher stirbt , ist l\u00e4nger tot ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780180/ ) ( the sooner you die , the longer you 're dead ) . 
  it is a comedy movie about a boy who blames himself for his mother 's death and who is convinced that after his own death he will be suffering eternal punishmet in hell so he tries to become immortal . 
  i do n't know what you mean by completlely unbalanced . 
  the share of immigrants in britain is lower than in some other eu countries . 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_non-nationals_in_the_resident_population,_1_january_2015_ ( % 25 ) _ yb16.png . 
  also britain has a significant number of immigrants from non eu countries where the government has control over but chose not to exercise this control . 
  britain could easily lower its immigration figures without leaving the eu . 
   ... you sometimes pine for the olden days when your country was a great empire . 
  be careful what you wish for . 
  this is how austria does it . 
  the eu of course for not giving them unrestricted access to the common market . 
  should n't this be called ' a swedish summer ' ? 
  let 's call it 10 emus . 
  emu ist the offical acronym for the european economic and monetary union , also [ emus ] ( http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17qtp0agra45ajpg/original.jpg ) are quite nice ( not to be confused with [ emo ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/ae/19/11/ae1911148533f8986d4b0ace25912f82.jpg ) ) . 
  alternatively we could use a nice german compound word like eurowirtschaftsgemeinschaftszahlungsmittel or something similar . 
  there is a political movement by die partei to [ make ulm great again ] ( https://twitter.com/diepartei_ulm/status/801070978621206528/photo/1 ) . 
  the syrian refugee however was arrested in biberach and that 's not even um ulm . 
  my favourate is still ( max und moritz ) [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/max_and_moritz] . 
  two boys play all sorts of pranks on adults until they get caught by the miller who literally puts them through the mill and feeds their remains to his chickens . 
  a red , white and blue brexit . 
  east germans are not a race . 
  i did n't say anything about terrorists but violent neo-nazis are very common in east germany . 
  as a west german i would like our gyms to ban eastern germans - out of fear of neo-nazi attacks . 
  [ the best ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7i4530tm5k ) finnish metal band . 
  there are some on youtube , they are not as good as the aryan reservation though and there are no english subtitles . 
  [ what our news would be like if we had sharia law ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cxy0kndgbe ) [ a dating app for the modern jihadist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-p1lvzpqmc ) [ is fighters go on strike ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oz_kzrbtsk ) because their wages have been cut due to low oil prices . 
  all clips were produced by our state propaganda channel . 
  the residents are called fucker , rhymes with hooker . 
  it 's because mocking extremists is always kind of funny , no matter if they are nazis , islamists , violent lefties or radical feminists . 
  i do n't mind foreigners if they integrate well and it is true that european countries are making many mistakes in this regard . 
  but that 's not at all what the video is about . 
  never heard of them . 
  these groups are unknown in germany so making fun of them would n't work . 
  by the way islamists for example also get their fair share of mockery on tv because they are a group we can relate to . 
   on the other hand , people making videos of any race that is keept by any other race in reservations and treat them as animals ... 
  i mean it is funny and provocative , but not a very good taste . 
  aryans are neither a race nor an ethnicity . 
  the term was used by the nazis to describe that people with certain physical features ( blond , tall , blue eyed ) are racially superior to others . 
  these days the term is only used by neo-nazis and that 's the group this video is making fun of . 
  do n't worry , white culture wo n't die . 
  it will be kept alive in reservations and zoos . 
  the video was made by germans for a german audience on topic they can relate to . 
  there are plenty of white supremacists in our country but i ca n't think of a single black supremacist so why sould they make a video about them ? 
   i do n't understand the point of it . 
  it makes fun of racists who belive in all the white genocide through migration bullshit . 
   german institute for humor this is probably the most german thing i 've heard . 
  nobody suggested we should change the rules and regulation regarding our press . 
  you 're pulling a strawman . 
  freedom of press does not mean they ca n't be critisized . 
  if journalists do a shitty job they should be called out . 
  now i 'm confused . 
  he said  `` we are already beginning with zero tariffs , and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence , as it is called . 
  in other words , our rules and our laws are exactly the same . '' is n't the whole point of brexit to get rid of these nasty eu rules and regulations and take back control ? 
  you are misinterpreting the statistics . 
  the first one is about exports to britain from all eu countries and the second one is about imports to the uk , it doese n't say anything about germanys exports to other countries . 
  in fact the usa is our [ single biggest export market ] ( http://imgur.com/a/8jbyw ) followed by france and the uk . 
  edit : fixed link to statistics, 
  these numbers are mainly made up by the media , the eu has not brought up a hard figure so far . 
  the issue is that britain does not want to negotiate a divorce bill at all . 
  a quote from the article :  another eu diplomat said : `` it is reasonable to expect the brits to say something other than ` we will not pay a penny . ' if that 's not the case , what is there to talk about ? '', 
  more like wtf, 
  a majority of east german `` refugees '' were not persecuted by their government , they fled because the standard of living was higher in the west . 
  look at [ the mess ] ( http://www.kraftfuttermischwerk.de/blogg/wp-content/uploads2/2015/08/pragerbotschaft.jpg ) they made . 
  he opened the gates for thousands of economic migrants . 
  i do n't think anyone is trying to convince britain to reverse their decision . 
  the america first cover was a bit too extreme in my opinion . 
  of all the trump and miss liberty caricatures [ this one ] ( https://twitter.com/cosmo__ard/status/796254478387343360 ) is my favourate . 
  same here . 
  i have [ this jar ] ( http://imgur.com/a/twqzo ) full of copper coins . 
  ca n't wait to get it to the bank . 
  yeah , appeasing us has always worked great in the past . 
  i do n't know about other european countries but this is certainly true for germany . 
  we are generally very risk-averse and so are investors over here . 
  for example a startup like twitter could never have happened in germany . 
  basically their plan was to grow like crazy and then figure out how to make money and their investors were fine with that . 
  in germany startups need a solid business plan in order to attract investors . 
  / r/de is quite active but full of low quality content and many people use a strange kind of germanized 4chan lingo . 
  / r/germany is quite ok though , mostly expats and tourists asking for advice . 
  in order to pick up a rifle he would have to take off his hand of that pint glass . 
  can he manage that ? 
  i ca n't tell if this is satire or not . 
  * ehrenwimpel * is only for those kids who pass with excellent results , all others only get a * siegerwimpel * . 
  we do the same in germany ( at least in some states ) . 
  everyone who passes gets these [ cool pennants and stickers ] ( http://www.anderst.bayern/wp-content/uploads/ehrenwimpel_mia_2014.jpg ) for their bike . 
  a typical piece of jpost `` journalism '' . 
  according to them there are only two kinds of people in this world - jews and anti-semits . 
  it 's a bit confusing for americans because both countries are in central europe and share a border with australia . 
   and they would not pay for this movies when cant get them for free ... they would just not watch it if the movies they download from piracy sites are not good enough to pay for , why are they so upset when their favourate piracy site is shut down ? 
  that 's the problem . 
  freeloaders want to see movies , they just do n't want to pay for it . 
  geez it was just a bad joke . 
  brits really do n't have a sense of humour these days .
