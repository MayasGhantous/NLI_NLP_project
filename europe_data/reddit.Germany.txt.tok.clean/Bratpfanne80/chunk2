  he is used to dealing with difficult british prime ministers . 
  they come and go but juncker is still here . 
  i love the telegraph 's wording . 
   the eu has been plotting for weeks to thwart theresa may 's plans to secure a deal for ** british expats ** in europe and ** migrants ** in the uk, 
  anyone who served in the bundeswehr knows how much of joke they are . 
  by the way [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/1._flarakgrp_22.jpg ) was my squadron 's coat of arms . 
  we used to call ourselves the combat bunnies . 
  yes but even without a deal we will continue to trade with each other . 
  maybe the uk will just become our second or third largest trading partner . 
   i could be wrong , but is n't the uk the eus single largest export market ? 
  yes but even so it 's just 16 % of exports that go to the uk . 
  oh i remeber that one . 
  when i was 16 i went to a summer camp in tuscani with our church community and they would play it every night at the camping site 's disco . 
  this is the first time i 'm listening to this song without my head being full of cheap lambrusco . 
  it 's easy to fix . 
  create better producs that other countries want to buy . 
  i do n't know any venzuelans personally but from my uninformed sterotypes they generally friendly and outgoing people like a lot of latin americans and i feel sorry for their situation . 
  fall of the berlin wall, 
  we used to have a similar paper until 1945 . 
  also justin , dustin , jason , jayden, 
  as a bavarian i agree with you . 
  there is a massive housing shortage in munich but a couple of years ago people decided in a referendum that new condos must not be higher than the marienkirche ( about 100m ) . 
  so the citizens of munich deserve high rents . 
  i find it boring but i respect it more than soccer these days . 
  todays soccer players are such a bunch of cry babies and drama queens it 's embarrassing .

  thank you . 
  it always makes me cringe to see tourists eating sauerkraut with saussage because they think it 's authentic german cuisine . 
  i think european countries are too different and a federal europe wo n't work . 
  agree with that . 
  most germans probably heard about tesla but do n't know who musk is . 
  i would like to see a bit more of the american optimism and this we-can-do-this attitude in germany . 
  our mentality is quite the oppisite , we are very risk-averse and need an insurance against everything that can go wrong . 
  [ we lost against austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bso-rtgpnm ) during the 1978 football world cup in argentina . 
  the game is known as * the disgrace of cordoba * in germany and * the miracle of cordoba * in austria and it helped shaping their national identity . 
  and superior in being arrogant, 
   if you willing to pump money into us like you did in eastern germany i do n't mind . 
  ok , czechia it is then . 
  a lot of germans graduate from school when they are 16 or 17 and start an apprenticeship which is paid . 
  there are limitations about the hours they are allowed to work . 
  for example during summer holidays i used to work at a cinema and when i was still 17 i was only allowed to work until 10pm . 
  of course they can be officially employed when younger than 18 but they need their parents permission . 
  what about protectorate of bohemia and moravia ? 
  switzerland because it is the only country we have n't invaded in the last 100 years . 
  same,

   i 've never witnessed an austrian rant [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4kroa2chzk ), 
  yeah i saw one as well . 
  i loved his dead pan delivery . 
  you can apply for one by filling out permit a38 . 
  yes . 
  yeah we like to keep things in order . 
  on / r/de there is a designated humor flag so people immediately know when something is supposed to be funny . 
  we 're funnier than islamists .

  i learned that * the czech republic is now called czechia and moved from eastern to central europe * slovenia and slovakia have the euro * the french have this awesome christmas cake called b\u00fbche de no\u00ebl which i 'm gon na try this year my view of romania is also more positive thanks to their protests and how they kept us up to date on / r/europe . 
  a popular conspiracy theory amongst radical left wingers is that [ red army faction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) terrorists andreas baader , gudrun enslin , and jan-carl raspe did not commit suicide but were killed by the german secret service . 
  off the top of my head i remeber * smashing a beer bottle only to cut myself with broken glass a few minutes later * when camping first getting drunk and then pitch the tent instead of the other way round * throwing a can of antiperspirant spray into a bonfire just to see what happens * discovering that playgrounds are more dangerous than one might think luckily darwin was kind to me . 
   so ... you just go whatever you speed you feel like ? 
  what ? 
  there is no * general * speed limit for autobahns . 
  about a third of the sections are limited , some with electronic signs that change according to traffic or weather conditions . 
  for the unlimited sections there is only a * recommended * driving speed of 130kmh ( 80mph ) . 
  on these you can go as fast as you like ( or as fast as traffic permits ) . 
  the debate which has been going on for decades is about wether or not to make the recommended speed a mandatory limit . 
  you ca n't just leave the eu without our permission . 
  also the hofbr\u00e4uhaus in munich . 
  shitty food , shitty beer and totally cramped . 
  introducing a general speed limit on the autobahn . 
  it 's basically our equivalent of the american gun control debate and the arguments are quite similar . 
  those in favor of imposing a general speed limit want to take away the freedom and our god given right to drive our cars as fast as we want . 
  there is also a strong lobby organization [ ( adac ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adac ) advocating against speed limits . 
  simplyfy our tax system . 
  our income tax system is horribly complicated because it tries to accommodate every possible combination of life circumstances so there are thousands of things which are deductable and thousands of exceptions for specific groups of people . 
  the bureaucratic overhead is enormous . 
  everyone agrees that it should be simplyfied but nobody wants to give up their little benefits . 
  there were some politicians who seriously tried and their careers ended pretty quickly . 
  `` you guys are so socialist you do n't even have a french word for entrepreneur . '', 
  arya stark because she is just badass . 
  i have a colleague from barcelona and when i want to tease him it often goes like this me : have you heard the news ? 
  your king has ... 
  him : he is not my king !!!!, 
  sometimes kids need a pad on the back . 
   anyone not crazy about her being in power for 12 years ? 
  not really . 
  i guess it 's because she is not on twitter . 
  when driving on the autbahn always stick to to left lane . 
  in cologne : ask if they serve alt in d\u00fcsseldorf : ask if they serve k\u00f6lsch in bavaria : ask if they serve miller when visiting neuschwanstein castle tell everyone how it looks like disney world . 
  yes , i listen to latin american music . 
  sometimes i google for translations of the lyrics so i have at least some clue what the songs are about . 
   additionally to that many germans know so indelibly incredibly little about austria ... 
  i know and this is so embarrassing . 
  like many people think your capital city is sydney but it 's actually canberra . 
  one of the bigger re-enactments in germany is the [ landshut wedding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landshut_wedding ) which commemorates the wedding between george of bavaria and hedwig jagiellon , daughter of king casimir of poland . 
  it is celebrated every four years with more than 2000 people taking part in parades , dance performances , tournaments and other festivities .

  good to hear . 
  what is your expert opinion on breaded schnitzel with ketchup ? 
  my schnitzel policy is this : no sauce if it 's breaded , otherwise sauce is acceptable .
