  what `` simple fact '' would that be ? 
  & nbsp ;  you are ok with animals suffering because somebody wants to please their imaginary friend , i am not . 
  that 's as simple as it gets . 
  nah , you 're just an intolerant jerk who gets a boner from inconveniencing jews and muslims alike because some dumb-ass animals might feel ten seconds of pain before dying anyway . 
  ** that 's ** as simple as it gets . 
  & nbsp ; i bet you 'd like to ban circumcision , too , am i right ? 
  why not expel all jews right away and skip all the middle-steps ? 
  & nbsp ;  because these cases are a part of reality and are therefore part of the price you are willing to pay to be `` tolerant '' . 
  sure . 
  show me that this exception to the rule is super common and i will concede that point . 
  if not , your objection is mood because , again , stunning an animal can go wrong , too . 
  no , you 're just realizing that you are losing this argument and thus want to bail on it . 
  again , there is nothing `` extremely cruel '' about this . 
  and yes , ** if ** all goes well . 
  why would i give numbers for the case where things go wrong ? 
  if i did that i might as well say the same about failed instances of stunning animals . 
   you do realize that the blood does n't run out at full speed the whole time huh ? 
  what ? 
  blood pressure only drops once you have little to none left and by that time you are long since unconscious . 
  so yeah , during the time that matters it rushes , nay , gushes out at full speed . 
  have you never watched a beheading video ? 
  check out an isis twitter account and see for yourself . 
  & nbsp ;  and that you have enough time to realize what 's happening and to enjoy the pain of having your throat sliced ? 
  eh , i 'm not sure that is true . 
  after all , you lose consciousness within seconds and i 'm sure the shock about having your throat slit and gallons of blood leaving your body takes precedence over the pain . 
  what suffering there is will be secondary . 
  & nbsp ;  any source on seconds ? 
  there is a plethora of them out there so if this one is not to your liking , pick any of a dozen other ones . 
  no idea , i do n't own a car . 
  i mean i get your point but even in your scenario you would n't really be screwed . 
  which part ? 
   and the blood slowly running out of you . 
  you ... you think that a cut jugular has blood running out of it * slowly * ? 
  & nbsp ;  that means it 's much more painful to do it without than with . 
  yeah , no shit . 
  but if you 're gon na be dead ( or at least unconscious ) within ** seconds ** anyway , is it really that much of a big deal ? 
   why wo n't they just move to countries with lower taxes ? 
  because set-up costs are immense . 
  or how do you think they would relocate their entire production from one country to another ? 
  which countries would that even be ? 
  for a lot of modern industries you need considerable local infrastructure and a highly trained workforce . 
  i bet taxes and labor are cheaper in sudan . 
  yet you do n't see vw evacuating germany to shift their production to there . 
  besides , to whom would they sell their wares then ? 
  their countries of origin ? 
  to combat this tariffs on foreign products could be increased which would negate any benefit that the relocation would have had . 
  the political will to oppose these corporations is `` all '' that is needed . 
  similar idea with investments . 
  you ca n't just shift that money elsewhere , there 's simply not enough comparable opportunities . 
  if somalia allowed any company to invest tax-free in their country , do you suppose that the deutsche bank would all of the sudden pull its money out of the german economy and shower somalis with loans ? 
  as an aside , taxation is n't even the most important factor for investments according to the [ oecd ] ( http://oecdinsights.org/2015/11/18/do-lower-taxes-encourage-investment/ ) . 
  well , your examples of emergencies so far have not convinced me of that . 
  if you had , to use your example , 2000 $ a month then i think you wo n't find it hard to get your car fixed or move places . 
  especially if you were insured ( which can be , and in certain cases already is , governmentally required ) . 
  like what ? 
  and you honestly think that this is being threatened ? 
  or why bring it up ? 
  sure . 
  but i 'd rather we do that by having us all consuming more consciously rather than by having a lot of us consuming far less due to poverty while a few keep consuming as perversely as before . 
  and the latter is what would happen if mass unemployment struck . 
  besides , consumption need not be natural-resource intensive . 
  watching a movie or getting a massage is consumption in an economic sense , too . 
  you ... you do remember that we are talking about a world where work is no longer required to survive because of ubi , right ? 
  not having a car and not getting to your job would mean you had less money , not that you had none . 
  and again , these kind of situations can be avoided with insurance . 
  no need for a piggy bank where money is taken out of the economy and left to rot . 
  fairer taxation . 
  i mean you are aware that taxation of the rich has been steadily declining over the past couple of decades in most every western country , right ? 
  so let us bring it back to the level of the days of yore , i say . 
  enough with their hijacking of the political process and their self-serving policies . 
  and more often than that we see the population doing what their political/societal leaders suggest they do . 
  if your fears were grounded in reality , would n't we have ubi by now already ? 
  after all , everyone wants free money , right ? 
  in reality people think not just about themselves but their communities as well . 
  as this article shows a lot of people mistrusts ubi because they think the state ( which you fear they will happily run into the ground ) could not shoulder the costs . 
  that same concern would keep them from voting for unrealistic ubi increases , i say . 
  & nbsp ;  even with ubi you would still need emergency money , what happens if your car suffers a severe breakdown and you have to get it repaired or even buy a new one?house flooded in a storm?you catch my drift not really , no . 
  car breaks down ? 
  well , save up to get it fixed/buy a new one . 
  it 's not like you have to have a car . 
  house flooded in a storm ? 
  well , move out and rent a place rather than own one . 
  note that both your examples could be covered by insurance which i mentioned  the only way these situations would be bad is if you were heavily in debt . 
  but with ubi there is no need to be heavily in debt so these people would really only have themselves to blame . 
  no problem , comrade . 
   all these things are true except money ought to be moving instead of sitting in a piggy bank , i hope for your sake you are not one of these people with no emergency money . 
  i am not arguing against having reserves in the current system , i am arguing against having money stagnating in principle . 
  would you not agree that it would be better for that money to be in the economy , doing stuff , rather than outside of it ? 
  in a world with ubi and such you need n't set aside emergency money . 
  maybe get insurance , at best , but even that money is flowing back into the economy . 
  & nbsp ;  anyway , what do you think is going to happen to the economy if the people are going to repeatedly vote themselves money ? 2000 on the first year and then each year a populist party runs on increasing the ubi money , eventually you are going to destroy the economy and have runaway inflation from money printing . 
  i think you underestimate people 's intelligence and overestimate people 's greed . 
  if experts across the board tell people that `` x amount is sustainable , x+y is not '' then the majority will go along with that , it seems to me . 
  this run-away effect that you fear does not seem like a realistic outcome , i think . 
  for starters , people will feel more secure . 
  stress-related illnesses will decreases drastically , thereby increasing the country 's productivity and , as a result , the country 's wealth generation . 
  secondly , it will allow people to take greater risks with new business ventures ( because they always have the ubi to fall back on ) , hence leading to an increase in innovation . 
  thirdly , consumer demand will grow , benefiting the economy even more . 
  if you know that your basic needs are taken care of you are less likely to be tight with your money and counting every penny . 
  money ought to be moving , not rot in some emergency piggy bank .
