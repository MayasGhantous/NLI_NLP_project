  furthermore , individually people will feel free to work fewer hours , leading to yet again less stress , healthier employees and an increase in productivity . 
  anything else you wanted me to mention ? 
   the establishment are in the process of creating a permanent underclass right now and you are all `` but muh studies '' forgetting that these studies were designed from the outset to cast mass immigration in a positive light . 
  ah , yes , those sneaky scientists and their hidden agendas !, 
  will you provide us with actual proof for your allegations of conspiracy or just rant and rave on ? 
  & nbsp ;  in the uk , eu migrants are more likely to claim child benefits and in work tax credits than natives . 
  the uk taxpayer is effectively subsidising cheap labour from eastern europe . 
  we also pay out child benefits to large numbers of children still living in eastern europe . 
  sooo ... the parts of these studies that show the costs associated with immigrants are valid but the ones highlighting the benefits are ** evil globalist propaganda ** ? 
  or why are you apparently focusing on the former and ignoring the latter ? 
  & nbsp ;  i do not understand how people can not see that having a massive pool of labour in the lower end will result in a race to the bottom . 
  you seem to forget what is being discussed here , namely the inevitable automation of even `` high end '' jobs such as your doctors . 
  with a shrinking need for labor in general it seems obvious that you need to drive consumer demand somehow ( unemployed people tend to spend less than employed people ... or so i 've heard ) and giving people free cash is one way of doing that . 
  this would be financed by more heavily taxing the beneficiaries of that automation , namely the corporations that `` employ '' them . 
  robots do n't buy shit , mang . 
   i do n't . 
  that is good to hear . 
  so why the fear ? 
  since they 're no less productive than the local population , where is the issue ? 
  its the populace that creates the wealth to be shared via ubi . 
  i do n't see how increasing the populace ( and thus the wealth that is being created ) would create a problem . 
  unless , as i suspected at first , you think there are large differences in productivity among migrants and locals . 
  & nbsp ;  source ? 
  oh , i do n't know , maybe the [ oecd ] ( https://www.oecd.org/migration/oecd%20migration%20policy%20debates%20numero%202.pdf ) for instance ? 
  where is the study that showed that non-eea immigrants specifically did ** not ** provide a net benefit ? 
  you are not one of those equally poor sods who think all immigrants are the same , are you ? 
  an open-borders libertardian ? 
  no , where did you even get these impressions ? 
  huh , i somehow completely forgot about that case for a second . 
  you are correct . 
  i guess in those instances there is nothing being omitted . 
  well , i mean this is not a simple spelling mistake but a grammatical one which are hard to correct because you need a pretty advanced algorithm to recognize the context in which the word is used . 
  same with things like `` their/there '' . 
  both are correctly spelled words , but despite being homonyms they have different meanings and so one can not use them interchangeably . 
  a simple spell-checker can not help us in these instances :-(, 
   the crux is suffering . 
  getting your throat sliced hurts more when not under anesthesia then when you are . 
  that 's why i am against slaughtering without anesthesia ( or some non-medical equivalent ) . 
  yeah but my argument is that the suffering involved is small enough ( compared to anesthetized slaughter ) that it is still tenable . 
  & nbsp ;  milk , for example , is only produced by pregnant animals or animals that have recently been pregnant . 
  that 's constant wear and tear on the body for the benefit of somebody else and since i would n't want that done on myself i can understand why some people opt-out of that . 
  yeah but that 's an argument for a specific situation , namely industrial milk production , not against milk consumption in general . 
  i specifically maligned veganism that rejects animal products in principle , no matter the animal , no matter the circumstances . 
  surely we can agree that at least that variant is loony ? 
  so you are saying that `` implying that merkel is europe at it is worst '' sounds like proper english to you ? 
  or what ? 
  did you miss that he edited his post ? 
  i know but is n't it indicating an omission even in those cases ? 
  you know , specifically the omission of the possessive `` s '' after , say , a plural `` s '' as in , i do n't know , `` the dogs ' collars '' . 
  urgh , again with that dumb meme of demons ruling hell . 
  stupid heathens bringing along their notion of a `` lord of the underworld '' . 
  nah , was n't there stuff that could qualify among pompeii 's graffiti ? 
   maybe i 've listened to sam harris too much so ... you 've listened to sam harris , period :p ? 
   here are some examples of previous fields that we 've eliminated : yeah , fantastic , and people suffered as a result . 
  no one 's arguing that there wo n't be some equilibrium again sooner or later , just that there will be massive suffering in the meantime ( think the great depression but worse ) . 
  heck , even the flipping [ bank of england ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/robots-threaten-low-paid-jobs-says-bank-of-england-chief-economist ) says as much . 
  the u.n. 's human rights charter disagrees with you . 
  also , what if those efforts become increasingly futile ? 
  i mean your argument starts to no longer make sense when we 're talking about a world where fewer and fewer individuals hoard more and more of the world 's resources . 
  the reasonable person questions the legitimacy of these perverse hoardings , the unreasonable person tells people to squabble for the leavings . 
  how so ? 
  this is only a problem if you think of immigrants as leeches rather than the boon that they actually are . 
  economic studies show again and again , from country to country , that immigrants provide a net benefit financially over the long run . 
  you are not one of those poor sods who hold the paradoxical stereotype of the lazy-yet-job-stealing migrant , are you ? 
  `` typical x '' . 
  dude , come on , why the stereotyping ? 
  this is n't helping anyone . 
  there there . 
  it 's `` its '' , mang . 
  in english the apostrophe indicates omission ( e.g. 
  it 's = it is ) . 
  not trying to be condescending , just offering advice . 
   i really do n't think i said that , can you tell me where i said that ? 
  is that not the crux of your argument ? 
  i mean if the death is quick then how is it cruel ? 
  is this a language issue ? 
  should we switch to german ? 
  & nbsp ;  i actually would not say that . 
  i can see the appeal in not relying on other animals for my own survivial . 
  care to elaborate on that ? 
  i do n't see it . 
  & nbsp ;  and you are entitled to your opinion . 
  thanks . 
  that 's very gracious of you . 
   do i need to demonstrate that an operation without anesthesia is unnecessarily cruel or can we agree on that without me proving it ?? 
  i thought the question was whether or not it was cruel , not whether or not it was cruel ** er ** . 
  you can argue that antarctica is hotter than the arctic . 
  but from that it does not follow that antarctica is hot . 
  i do n't know why you seem to think that cutting an animal 's throat leads to a slow death . 
  aside from directly destroying the brain there is no faster way . 
  even a neck shot is slower because that merely paralyzes your heart and lungs . 
  misplaced concern there , dermac . 
  & nbsp ;  so glad i am not a vegan then . 
  also so glad that you know how to construct valid arguments . 
  would you argue that veganism as in `` avoid any and all animal products '' is not bordering on insanity ? 
  that caring about , say , insect `` suffering '' is n't loony ? 
  i mean i get vegetarianism but veganism is more about irrational , emotion-based ideology than reasonable , prudent policy , the way i see it . 
  yup , i had n't logged in in three months so i just replied to the newest replies i saw in my inbox . 
  problem ? 
   there is a reason that this type of killing is generally banned , because it is unncessarily cruel .
