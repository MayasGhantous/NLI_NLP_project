  that pact was voluntary , remember ? 
  & nbsp ;  it 's atrocious , it 's sexist , it 's full of hate against various groups of people , it belittles and glorifies violence against other humans , etc. 
  no , it 's not , silly . 
  stop it with the rabid psycho babble for a second and actually respond to me . 
  how is god any of these things ? 
  the only way one would arrive at that conclusion is by ignoring any and all context of god 's actions in the bible and denying his divinity and the implications this has for the ethicality of his actions . 
  the moral relationship between a creator and his creation is not the same as that between one creation and another . 
  & nbsp ;  the abrahamic super-ego actually destroys this natural empathy , for instance against women who have unsanctioned sexual intercourse or for homosexuals . 
  again with the selective reading , yeesh . 
  are n't you getting tired of cherrypicking ? 
  first off all , god does no such thing . 
  his followers are called upon to love ** everyone ** , adulterers and homosexuals included . 
  if anything our god transcends what you call `` natural empathy '' as we are even told to love our enemies , something you hardly find anywhere outside of christianity . 
  but you 're just going to gloss over this and continue your tirade regardless , are n't you ? 
  the truth sure is inconvenient when you have an agenda . 
  & nbsp ;  all forms of life are of divine origin . 
  and every atom is of divine origin . 
  if a lifeform tries to harm you , e.g. 
  a mosquito , it is not immoral to kill it . 
  wait , what ? 
  now you are going to argue that a mosquito taking less than a drop of blood from you constitutes harm and is punishable by death ? 
  so if you bump into me in the street i am justified in slaying you ? 
  do you have any idea how insane this sounds ? 
  & nbsp ;  if it wants something , then it gets it . 
  so i imagine the divine wants cancer , genocide and child rape then , right ? 
  i mean just look at the world , all these things exist . 
  must be because the divine wants those things to happen . 
  man , your theology is preposterous . 
  also , you contradicted yourself there . 
  you said `` i did n't say `` the divine wants this and that '' '' but now you did anyway . 
  what a hilarious lack of self-awareness you display !, 
  & nbsp ;  because these really complex things are actually rather easy to understand , when one understands what he is looking for . 
  right . 
  because quantum mechanism are easy to understand . 
  or gravity . 
  or chemical bondage . 
  or electromagnetism . 
  look , you obviously are not a scientist yourself . 
  way back in the day after newton 's discoveries science gave up trying to understand the world . 
  all it contented itself with thereafter was constructing and understanding theories ** about ** the world , not the thing itself . 
  do you understand the difference between theory and reality or should i explain that ? 
  & nbsp ;  my characterization of god is immature ? 
  lol !, 
  this characterization is far superior to any picture of this man-made god you ever had in your mind . 
  oy vey , no , it 's not . 
  your characterization is already inferior alone due to the fact that it is ill-informed and misrepresentative . 
  go read the bible with an open mind some time while , you know , looking at the context . 
  your exegesis is embarrassingly shallow and uninformed . 
  & nbsp ;  it acted like that because the primitive bronze age people who made up this god were fucking assholes and liars . 
  ooookay , i 've had about enough of this . 
  if you 're unwilling to even entertain the notion that you might be wrong then i guess this debate is pointless , is n't it ? 
  for all that talk about harmony you sure act in a vile and aggressive manner . 
  so much for that . 
  oh , by the way , you ** still ** avoid engaging my mention of apologetics . 
  i guess you are utterly unaware of their existence after all . 
   that 's a lie . 
  no , it 's not . 
  look , i already told you to stop being so melodramatic . 
  calling me a liar implies that i do not believe what i said and i ensure you that i do . 
  so , again , please cool your tits and use less assumptive language . 
  say `` that is wrong '' if you must . 
   it is bodily harm and removes millions of nerve endings from the penis . 
  it causes problems with sex later in life . 
  i never said that it is not bodily harm , just that it is not a huge deal . 
  as for it causing problems with sex later in life , that 's a pretty big claim . 
  care to provide me with evidence of that ? 
   yes , you answered it . 
  and obviously that `` god '' is a fake , as a real hyperintelligent entity which can create a universe would not prescribe such ridiculous bullshit . 
  why not ? 
  you have failed to address the reason that i gave for the prescription of this ritual . 
  what is your counter-argument to that ? 
   no one has to pay anything to god . 
  all is working on the laws of cause and effect . 
  there is no judgement day when you die . 
  the divine is not a judge , because it is not a person . 
  judgement day is every day . 
  you create a cause , there will be an effect . 
  oh , silly , now you 're all of the sudden assuming a priori that god does not exist . 
  look , either deny his existence and subsequently stop saying such nonsense like `` [ he ] should be sued for crimes against humanity '' or assume his existence ( at least for the sake of argument ) and address the moral obligations that this has for us . 
   i 'm not an anti-theist . 
  i 'm anti-religion . 
  my belief system/philosophy is close to pantheism or pandeism . 
  similar to those of einstein , spinoza , giordano bruno , chryssipus of soli , etc. 
  the ethical implications of this are that every atom , every lifeform , is a piece of the divine . 
  if you cut off a piece of the penis of a child , you are damaging a part of the divine for stupid reasons . 
  you are basically a criminal against the divine . 
  the divine evolved into being individuals who have foreskin . 
  and you damage what it evolved into . 
  you 're playing god by saying `` hurr durr my god wants this and that '' , at the same time you act against the divine and create problems for its sexuality . 
  what a weird notion . 
  pray tell , on what basis do you believe this ? 
  and if your deity is basically everything , where do your moral imperatives come from ? 
  why is everything good just because it evolved that way ? 
  and if circumcision is bad because it is `` damaging a part of the divine '' , what about hewing down a tree for building materials ? 
  or swatting a mosquito ? 
  are n't these acts of immoral monsters as a result ? 
  by the way , what you are doing is exactly what you accuse me of : going `` hurr durr , the divine wants this and that '' . 
  are you blind to your own hypocrisy ? 
   what ? 
  the jewish god is almost the same as the god of christianity , the god i grew up with .
