   will denmark prosecute imams that are preaching death sentence for apostates and gays ? 
  that depends on their laws concerning free speech and whether such inciting language is protected or not . 
  here in germany for example it is n't . 
  maybe in denmark ( like in the usa ) it is , not sure . 
   because this is the core of the problem , islam is not compatible with `` freedom of religion '' constitutional claim . 
  certain interpretations of islam are n't , sure . 
  but the same could be said of certain interpretations of judaism and pretty much any religion ( including buddhism ) . 
   religious fanaticism has led to 30 year war in europe . 
  everyone hoped that we are over it . 
  what ? 
  no , it has n't . 
  have you ever actually looked into the thirty years ' war in detail ? 
  i 'm asking because i 've studied history and one of the seminars that i attended during those studies had the thirty years ' war as its topic . 
  and religious fanaticism certainly had nothing to do with its underlying causes once you look beneath the surface . 
  maybe keep in mind for starters that it was machiavellian monarchs and feudal lords that started this war , not the pious peasantry . 
  you do n't honestly think that if a muslim kills another muslim in denmark because he changed his religion that he will not be prosecuted by the danish police , do you ? 
  i think you might wan na look up the definition of `` troll '' . 
  so then what was even the point of making that comment in the first place ? 
  one that i do n't get but i suppose that is bound to happen from time to time :p, 
  that 's fine only as long as `` yours '' includes all your compatriots . 
  and no , certainly not everyone does . 
  man , in a bright room like mine with some screen glare your flair looks pretty similar to germany . 
  yeah , no , i do n't think they really give a shit ... 
  how about you just reread your comments before posting them instead ? 
  sheesh , talk about relaxing ... maybe slow down your heated posting spree before you trip over yourself ? 
  again , reaaal slow : 1 ) `` safe state '' is an official legal term in the german constitution related to the evaluation of refugees ' asylum applications . 
  2 ) `` safe to travel to '' is not a legal term and the german foreign office theoretically can declare any country they want to as `` unsafe to travel to '' , there is no law about that in the german constitution . 
  in other words , one has nothing to do with the other . 
  you can have travel warnings being issued ( e.g. 
  because terrorists attack tourist spots ) about a country which ** is ** considered a safe state ( since it has rule of law and so on ) but you can also have the opposite case . 
  once more : travel warnings have nothing to do with the legal term `` safe state '' . 
  that is why i asked you to explain to me your reason for bringing up these unrelated terms in the first place . 
  if a country executes muslims who convert to another faith for instance then that would not be a `` safe state '' but it could still be a country for which it is not particularly dangerous for german tourists to travel to . 
  huh ? 
  `` reporting this way '' ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  normal ? 
  i 'm not sure , are there studies on that ? 
  it 's pretty deplorable in either case . 
  coincidentally , it is also what caused this whole mess : the monetary powers that be refusing to chip in and only caring for their own benefit . 
   no citation needed : you 're stating that . 
  that 's not how the burden of proof works , mate . 
  also , where did i state that said new migrants would lower the level of germany as a whole ? 
  that 's your claim . 
  and in what sense would they * raise * the level ? 
  was that not clear ? 
  they would raise the level compared to previous migrants who were even less skilled than they ( all hypothetically of course since we do not know who would actually come ) but who already benefited the state at the very least economically more than they burdened it . 
  as such it seems logical to assume that better educated , better qualified migrants would benefit the state even more . 
  so how did they `` move closer to the eu without joining it '' over the past couple of decades ... other than that non-finalized visa deal ? 
  is that all you had in mind when you wrote that ? 
  hear hear . 
   i did n't vote for the scum that does n't work for our benefit . 
  you are but one voter so you still have plenty of other people to blame even if you yourself are n't part of the problem . 
  also , kinda weird that you 'd judge the effectiveness of policy based solely on your own , personal benefit from it . 
  not very caring of you . 
  again , how the fuck is that relevant to questioning whether an entire ** country ** has freedom of religion ? 
  that question obviously concerned the state 's legal framework , not any group 's private actions . 
  if there was some pastafarian sect in slovakia that killed any of its members who tried to leave , would you say that in the entire country of slovakia there is no ** right ** to practice any religion you want ? 
  would an affirmation of that question on such a basis make sense to you ? 
  according to that definition ( `` criticism of islam = islamophobia '' ) nothing is wrong with it . 
  but i hope you realize that the actual definition of it that is used by the public is not that . 
  yes , it is just a video game but also , our reactions are just comments on the internet , not an armed lynch mob with murder on their mind . 
  your demand for us to `` chill '' is just out of line . 
  what kind of dumb question is this ? 
  you are conflating two unrelated concepts here , namely the concept of `` safe to travel to '' with the legal term `` safe state '' . 
  yes , most islamic countries are not safe states via the definition in the german constitution . 
  no , that does not mean that all of them have a travel ban associated with them , often because that political persecution for instance is not a danger to tourists and as such are not necessarily unsafe for germans to travel to . 
  did you really had to have this difference explained to you ? 
  who said it was ? 
  again , i refer you to your own question that started all this :  and islamophobia is a bad thing becauuuuse ... ? 
  you did not ask if the term islamophobia is beneficial to a conversation or anything , you asked why the thing itself , islamophobia , is bad . 
  and let me repeat my own question : how do you define islamophobia ? 
  i mean christians who actively practice their faith . 
  to declare ** all ** members of the state church as agnostics seems unwarranted . 
  hahaha , an appropriate punishment i suppose . 
  man , this sub sure takes its time to catch up with recent events ... 
  well , what do you expect ? 
  these science journalists are often failed scientists who did n't make the cut but were ( seemingly ) good enough to at least communicate scientific results to the layman . 
   this sub seems to be pro-brexit to me . 
  even among the non-british . 
  people with a conscience . 
  conversely , people in support of this are intellectually dishonest cunts who somehow manage to tell themselves that these countries are `` states in which neither political persecution nor inhumane or humiliating punishment and treatment take place '' ( the legal definition of * safe states * in the grundgesetz , the german constitution ) . 
  not for persecuted minorities . 
  are you for real ? 
  do you even know the fucking definition of a safe state ? 
  you probably do n't so here you go :  [ s ] tates in which neither political persecution nor inhumane or humiliating punishment and treatment take place this is the legal definition found in the grundgesetz . 
  now tell me again with a straight face that those states fit this definition . 
  so blame the fucktards who keep voting for the same scum that does not work for their benefit . 
  well , experience shows that money that is not your own ( but , for example , comes from grants ) tends to be spent frivolously so i am not sure if this would be the be-all end-all ... 
  christians living in denmark ? 
  given that i neither know nor even considered your ethnicity i 'm ma simply deny that . 
  said `` something '' were your own words . 
  i like volker pisper 's bit about the german voter in that regard . 
  you know , his * `` walking around the block , stepping into shit and once they come around again they knowingly step into it again because at least that way there can be no nasty surprises '' * bit . 
  protest ? 
  well , i 'm not gon na march on their headquarter or anything , it 's too far away from me . 
  but i will fume on the internet about it :p as for boycotting , i have n't bought an ea product in years . 
  the last time was battlefield 3 via a humble bundle and even that was not directly . 
   only the level of the turks , but consequently also lower the level of germany as whole .
