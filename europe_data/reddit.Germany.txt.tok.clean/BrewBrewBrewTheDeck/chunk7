   ussr was totalitarian police state , any opposition was crushed without mercy . 
  i know that today 's russia is less merciless but is n't it still kind of a police state to some extent ? 
  the press and protestors are not exactly free either . 
  exactly . 
  it was n't prepared to bend over and continue letting the uk buttfuck it with its demands for special , preferential treatment , you mean . 
   make that for more than a century now . 
  colonialism , wars , bloody coups , destabilizing already fragile countries . 
  you name it . 
  sure but i do n't think those really contributed in a major way to the current wave of terrorism though . 
  again , it depends on your definition of normal and the context in which you are speaking . 
  yes , compared to the past or certain other countries it is abnormal . 
  within this timeframe and geographical location , however , it ** has ** become `` normal '' if defined as a certain frequency . 
  and that was the question asked . 
   perhaps they should n't keep stealing from people ... see , these are the kind of generalizations that lead to discrimination in the first place . 
  also , `` well , if they did n't want to be mass murdered they should n't have stolen stuff '' ? 
  really ? 
  you 're fucking scum if this is what you actually meant . 
  oh and cool slippery slope there . 
  i meant funky in a positive way though :p there was one with coffee that i miss to this day , i can not find it anywhere here . 
  that , too . 
  so you do n't have a point of comparison , gotcha . 
  you know what would have helped your french and english more ? 
  french . 
  \u2019cause , you know , french and english interbred a lot more than latin and english did . 
  and , well , french obviously helps your french more than latin does ; , 
  what practical skills ? 
  you still learn grammar in french classes for instance , you know ? 
  depends on the degree ; in some , yes . 
  was ? 
  no , it would n't , as outlined in the other response to you . 
  this is why the `` war on terror '' is so fucking retarded even on a merely conceptual level alone . 
  terrorists do n't become so through genetics or viruses , they become ones through ideas . 
  and you ca n't remove ideas unless you live in a hitherto impossible to implement hyper dystopian surveillance state . 
   that is literally not possible if you actually expelled all the muslims . 
  you do realize that there are not only domestic terrorists , right ? 
  yes if you somehow magically managed to expel all muslims then there would be no more ** domestic ** muslim terrorists . 
  oh wait , no , that would n't actually work because then there 's still the threat posed by converts . 
  but even if that would magically not matter , you would still face danger by travelers ( whom you ca n't screen effectively in the eu ) . 
  so my point stands , the net effect would merely be a justified increase in anger among muslims , probably resulting in ** more ** attacks , not fewer . 
  nope , only heard of it . 
  what is its relevance here ? 
  who said anything about isis ? 
  i am talking about eliminating reasons that drive people to terrorism in the first place . 
  how many recruits do you think would be lining up to sign up for blowing themselves up if their homelands had n't been raped by western forces over the past couple of decades ? 
  why do you think islamist terrorism is such a relatively recent phenomenon in our countries ? 
  yeah , sure , that may have been the intention but what it also does is punish people with unpopular opinions from speaking up , thus kind of censoring dissenting voices . 
   i 'm sure this idea is worthless , because otherwise it would have been implemented a long time ago . 
  germany has some such laws and they are worth jackshit in the age of the internet . 
  not that they were particular effective even before that , i imagine . 
  nice reply . 
  i can see you put a lot of effort into that response . 
  learn some tact , you swine . 
  if you honestly think that the eu would invade its member states with an eu army then delusional and paranoid are among the nicer adjectives one can assign to you . 
  not only is it highly unlikely for political and societal reasons , it does not even make sense internally . 
  why , for instance , would the contingents of soldiers from whatever country is about to be invaded follow orders of brussel over those from home ? 
  go hawk your fear mongering somewhere else , crackpot . 
  yeah but it is not like the access to information in previous centuries was free and uncensored . 
  but i get your point . 
  precisely . 
  not that you should n't try to prevent it . 
  just do n't sacrifice essential freedoms to do so or spend inane , disproportionate amounts of money . 
  so why bring it up ? 
  do you not think that european colonization killed more than intertribal warfare ? 
  like , this should be obvious from a technological standpoint alone ( firearms vs. melee weapons ) . 
  oh , do go on about those things that can be done about it . 
  if it 's expulsions of muslims you have in mind then i am afraid that i 'll have to disappoint your belief in the effectiveness of that policy :'( in fact , something as heavy-handed as that would more likely result in the opposite and serve only to recruit more terrorists . 
   odd because i 'm pretty sure japan does n't deal with terrorist attacks every few weeks . 
  huh , i wonder why that is . 
  maybe because they have n't bombed the fuck out of muslims recently and thus drawn the ire of extremists ? 
  inb4 * b-but muh racial purity * & nbsp ;  but what would i know , apparently children being blown up is just a natural and unpreventable process and we should do nothing . 
  way to take my comment the wrong way . 
  all i am saying is that if a determined individual wants to cause death and destruction they will be able to do so . 
  hence one should focus on removing the reasons for those individuals ' actions rather than preventing the act , which is nigh impossible and leaves you with piece of shit politicians using it as an excuse to extend governmental powers and chipping away at freedoms . 
  depends on what you mean by normal . 
  if by normal you mean `` frequent '' then yes , it is normal . 
  but that does not mean that one should not try to curb it . 
  just to remember that any such efforts will have only minimal effects if the core roots are not addressed and that as such these measures ought not end up costing us more ( e.g. 
  in terms of freedoms ) than they benefit us ... which is little and less . 
  exactly . 
  how is it like being that delusional and paranoid ? 
  have an upvote for that at least . 
   i doubt the us is going to want europe getting involved in libya regardless . 
  fuck what the u.s. wants , mate . 
   there is a clear majority in europe who want less integration is there , ol\u2019 pal ? 
  & nbsp ;  the eurocrats ahhh , there we have it . 
  words of truth . 
  * b-but muh u.s. hegemony * . 
  `` now '' ? 
  this has been the way to do it for centuries but especially after the 50s . 
  may trump stump may or may may stump trump ? 
   because in 90s russia efficiently did not have a government which against to revolt . 
  i also mentioned `` during the ussr '' though , what about then :3 ? 
  not really . 
  do you honestly think terrorism would vanish if the government did not give a shit about political correctness ? 
  please tell me again how well the indian government ( probably one of the the furthest from political correctness ) is at curbing terrorism in its nation . 
  fair enough . 
  but even i mentioned slaughter and kept the focus on that . 
  the holocaust comparison was meant to show the idiocy of the argument against it qualifying as a slaughter because there were survivors . 
  not sure what you mean . 
  is it a problem for whom to ignore whom ?
