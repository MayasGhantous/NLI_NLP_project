  & nbsp ;  did n't know that . 
  i guess you do n't get downvoted a lot then :p, 
  exactly . 
  well , i mean better late than never , i guess ... 
  who ever said anything about genocide , cabron ? 
  i thought we were discussing the use of the word `` slaughter '' , remember ? 
  if you are referring to your comment regarding trump 's reason for kneeling , what is there for me to address ? 
  and if it is not that , what else even is there to reply to in your comment ? 
  as i said , the trump picture was posted as a tongue-in-cheek reply to your merkel picture . 
  if you are dumb enough to miss that and take it as serious that is on you . 
  but that is the point . 
  there apparently are not effective measures which is what that these scared pussies need to accept . 
   why ? 
  do people really need that kind of validation from strangers ? 
  nah , because getting a lot of downvotes on reddit is a fucking pain in the ass since it will lead to you only being able to comment once every 10 minutes which makes replying a chore . 
  well , good luck with that , i suppose . 
  how is that an answer to my question ? 
  do you honestly think that `` more cooperation '' would have lead to considerably better performances in these investigations ? 
  i mean this is easier said than done . 
  there is n't a magic `` more cooperation '' strategy that you can employ and suddenly prevent any and every crime . 
  in certain instances , sure . 
  but not with all , for example , romani individuals . 
  it 's not like every romani looks like a stereotypical `` romani '' . 
  is this something generals get to decide ? 
  i figured politicians would make those choices . 
   because latin and ancient greek are the main roots of west-european languages , and that when you learn either of those , you become more knowledgeable and fluent in our modern languages . 
  to be fair , the same can be said about other languages , such as romanic ones like french . 
  i think the studying reason is the more relevant one . 
  because it is a requirement for some university degrees ( e.g. 
  theology , history , medicine , ... ) , i think . 
   latin teaches you how languages fundamentally work , and is therefore a great language if you want to learn more languages in the future . 
  the same is true of romanic languages like french though . 
  i know your argument and i am tired of it . 
  we got told the same shit in school but it made as little sense then as it does now . 
  eh , i mean there ** might ** be more ( or better ) that could be done . 
  i 'm just saying that one should not delude oneself about the ultimate effectiveness of these measures . 
  good on you . 
  the established media in most places is fucking garbage ( and not in the `` they do n't support muh narrative '' sense ) . 
  they are institutionally self - * censored * as par for the course . 
  power does not like being spoken up against . 
  no reason to just straight-up trust any of them . 
  that depends . 
  it is not derailing a discussion to question the moral authority of a person by pointing to their own immorality when they are lecturing you on your ethics . 
  like , yeah , the russians invading crimea is not made right by the usa 's own wrongdoings but i will sure as fuck bring up their ongoing invasions ( e.g. 
  cuba ) when a u.s. politician opens his big fat mouth to act holier-than-thou . 
  eh , those are n't entirely guilt-free either , considering that pence renounced those practices . 
  kinda beating the dead horse on that one . 
  my bad then . 
  i thought that you assumed `` nothing serious '' would happen to them based on their ethnicity , not based on the way the justice system is set to work in general . 
  still , i 'm not sure you are correct although , admittedly , i have not looked into this either . 
  it seems to me from personal experience though that the justice system does n't really care about treating anyone particularly carefully . 
   name calling makes you seem petty , go ahead , keep digging your grave . 
  not namecalling , mate , keen observations is what they are . 
  & nbsp ;  what argument ??? 
  that you are a hypocrite for chastising me for my support of sch\u00e4chten whereas you yourself seem to have no trouble supporting industrial meat production . 
  & nbsp ;  straw man . 
  and the worst one this week ( so far ) . 
  how so ? 
  you might want to look up what a strawman argument actually is . 
  this is n't one . 
  you are butthurt about an arguably small degree of suffering , why not assume that you would be just as butthurt about another , even smaller one ? 
  & nbsp ;  and you are an expert on that because you have experienced it i guess ? 
  nah but other people have and told us about it . 
  also , science . 
  but sure , go ahead and keep pretending that shock does n't exist and that adrenaline and dopamine do n't dull pain . 
  & nbsp ;  which is like saying that operations without anesthesia do n't considerably hurt more than operations without . 
  nah , it 's like saying that death by firing squad without anesthesia does not hurt considerably hurt more than death by firing squad without it . 
  which , i hope , is something that you will admit for once . 
  & nbsp ;  you did n't call me out [ ... ] i did : `` sooo ... not gon na respond to the accusations then ? 
  sure they do , schlechtmensch , 
  your point being ? 
  oh , so this is more of a cost-thing than an ideological/political thing , you think ? 
  not sure if serious ... 
  what rest of your statement did you want me to address ? 
   do you not have the ability to identify different ethnicity by sight ? 
  within a margin of error of course . 
  of some people , yes . 
  but that is not the argument being made here . 
  it 's not that you can not tell that person a is ethnicity b. it 's that you can not tell that everyone of ethnicity b looks like person a. 
  in other words , while there are ** some ** common features among ** some ** people of any given ethnicity , there is far too much variation to make such bold claims as `` i can tell any [ person of ethnicity ] on sight '' . 
  see what i 'm getting ? 
  my point was that there is a history of not only institutional but governmentally mandated discrimination against the romani people and that this shit does not go away over night :3 heck , in some places ( e.g. 
  france ) it actually continues to this day . 
  if so i pity him for all those downvotes . 
  i thought that it was a bit funny if that 's any consolation . 
  language exploded into being ** surprisingly ** recently , in fact . 
  same biological basis for millennia upon millennia then suddenly , *** boom *** , sentience , baby !, 
  not only disease , mate . 
  neither of that excuses the brutal colonization that went on regardless though . 
  why feel the need to defend jingoistic rapists and murderers ? 
   the `` spanish side '' did not slaughter tribes . 
  in fact , mexica and mayan and quechua and guarani and hundreds more indigenous groups still live in their originals . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  is your argument really `` there are still some alive today so you ca n't call it slaughter '' ? 
  guess the nazis did n't slaughter any jews either then . 
  also , what have the plagues to do with anything ? 
  the conquistadors still brutally killed thousands upon thousands in the invasion and subsequent colonization of the americas . 
  huh ? 
  how is it racist ? 
  i mean i frequently see it used by racists , sure , but that does not make it inherently racist .
