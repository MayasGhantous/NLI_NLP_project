  here is how it goes : the more children you have , the more people will work to feed you once you get old . 
  because thats how it works in 3rd world nations without any relevant welfare . 
  in fact , this specific child died because his parents took a substantial risk when they tried to get themselves smuggled into europe . 
  turns out risks can backfire . 
  its a shame this family had to die , but it was the result of their decision to leave turkey . 
  in north-western europe as it seems . 
  they do this because we allow it . 
  its perfectly understandable for them to try it , just as its reasonable for us to prevent this kind of migration . 
  in theory , we would simply force them to live in europe at our terms because we can . 
  but we dont , at least not yet . 
  they get to play us for fools and we allow it . 
  if they actually refuse to integrate , we get a perfectly fine reason to kick them out . 
  as i said we need a proper procedure to deal with both the integration and all results it can produce . 
  but we have no choice in this . 
  unless we refuse asylum applications on principle , we need to at least integrate those people . 
  i am not saying we should take everybody , hell i dont like mass immigration at all . 
  but those people that we do take should get whatever support they possibly need to become self sustained . 
  there is no point to force them to sit on their asses . 
  teach them the language and get them working . 
  a semi integrated immigrant working a mediocre job is better than an unemployed one taking 800 euro a month of wellfare . 
  that bullshit works right now , its not going to work forever . 
  the issue with the little girl is really not important at all . 
  most people in germany though merkel did ok . 
  there was no big scandal about it here , nobody really cared that much . 
  but yes merkel will dial back the hippie bullshit if public opinion changes . 
  it make take a few months or years though . 
  an airbase in turkey is worth more than the opinion of a bunch of kurds , evidently . 
  except for the fact that russia isnt rolling over anybody in syria just yet . 
  its not about integrating all of them . 
  and it doesnt even matter if you like imigration . 
  but its simply in our very best interest to integrate every immigrant that gets asylum . 
  it doesnt matter if its easy or not . 
  i would like a proper procedure for integration and what to do if it doesnt work tho . 
  welcome to integration . 
  lets see if bayern actually maintains this programme or just slowly phases it out once the pr isnt worth it anymore . 
  or he has no delusion about what kind of world we live in . 
  being naive doesnt make you a good person . 
  which the best semi realistic solution we have right now . 
  syria was one of the more moderate dictatorships before the rebellion . 
  and the west has no business in syria either way . 
  muslims dont integrate as well in europe because a ) we 're not very good at it for the most part and b ) we cant handpick the muslims we take in . 
  because you know , we dont have the luxury of a nice , deep ocean between us and the next few countries with large muslim populations . 
  and this `` entire issue '' is basically that we cant integrate muslims properly . 
  yes they might be harder to integrate , but its still possible . 
  well yes . 
  its good if you want to help , but being naive about it doesnt do anything for you and the people you try to help . 
  it shouldnt be hard to find a local org that helps the refugees , if you have money or time to spare work with them . 
  at the end of the day every human is an asshole , being hungry , afraid and lost tends to make it worse . 
  you really are special . 
  in case you dont read news : you guys are building the wall , the uk is using the dogs . 
  either option is pretty damn useless without eventually taking care of the reasons for this migration . 
  but if further integration is done based on the ez rather than the eu , the eu will have to be dialed back by a lot . 
  thats means goodbye to the parliament , ttip wont matter because it touches too many sensitive issues for a dialed back eu , etc. 
  the eu will basically be a free trade agreement . 
  we certainly wont need 2 fedderal parliaments . 
  but no eu nation is willing to give up core parts of their sovereignity . 
  so its not going to happen . 
  hell we already struggle to keep the eu together with the current level of integration . 
  thats because there is no actual discussion on the migration topic right now . 
  all we have is right wing morons like cameron and orban that want to build big ass walls and hunt migrants with dogs on one side . 
  and ( ironically ) merkel roleplaying a deluded communist hippy and denouncing everybody that is critical of migration as nazi on the other side . 
  neither side has any ideas that are both practical and respect basic human rights . 
  too bad , if the uk stays a closer political integration will be impossible . 
  which in turn means the eu is done for and all further integration will be based on the ez . 
  alrights lets get some facts . 
  1 . these buildings were build as emergency apartments for homeless people 50 years ago 2 . 
  its said that this family pays 400 euro rent for their home . 
  however , even if literally all of them live of social wellfare they can get around 630 euro ( probably more ) per month for rent alone . 
  which means they can infact afford a better home . 
  source : http://harald-thome.de/media/files/kdu,-ae,-but-rilis/kdu-vorderpfalz-ludwigshafen---01.01.2014.pdf 3 . 
  these buildings were supposed to be demolished long ago . 
  these people should have been aware of this fact . 
  why didnt they look for an alternative ? 
  especially since they can afford to rent a more expensive house ? 
   following the 2003 ** invasion of iraq ** , the jordanian salafi jihadist abu musab al-zarqawi and his militant group jama'at al-tawhid wal-jihad , founded in 1999 , achieved notoriety in the early stages of the ** iraqi insurgency ** for the suicide attacks on shia islamic mosques , civilians , iraqi government institutions and italian soldiers partaking in the us-led ` multi-national force ' . 
  al-zarqawi 's group officially pledged allegiance to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network in october 2004 , changing its name to tanzim qaidat al-jihad fi bilad al-rafidayn ( \u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0641\u062f\u064a\u0646 , `` organisation of jihad 's base in mesopotamia '' ) , also known as ** al-qaeda in iraq ( aqi ) ** [ ... ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#foundation.2c_1999.e2.80.932006 come again ? 
  the point is : she didnt want to act and she decided as little as she could without actually making a call . 
  and the opinions on bailouts turned around a few days before an agreement was reached . 
  alright , what did she do for greece ? 
  because what i saw was her agreeing to a deal that will buy time at massive cost , but wont fix anything . 
  she didnt want to be the chancellor that breaks the union and she didnt want to commit to anything that would actually fix the problem . 
  so she decided not to decide anything and wasted 86 billion euro just to move the problem away for now . 
  you cant get much more indecisive than that . 
  and you need to get 99 % votes in favor of something in order to get it done . 
  good luck with that . 
  merkel always was a populist . 
  she literally does nothing unless she knows its 100 % going to be received well by the general public . 
  she is the most pathetic kind of politician , she is so afraid of making mistakes or failing at things that she doesnt even try . 
  you could put her into a burning house and she 'd wait for polls whether or not putting out the fire is considered a good idea before doing anything . 
  merkel only stepped up and spoke in favor of immigration and refugees after the public oppinion was already heavily in favor of them . 
  its picture perfect merkel style politics , always agree with the largest group you can find . 
  merkel would not have found clear words like she did if public opinion was different . 
  isis was created by a bunch of people that met in an iraqi prison . 
  and even the current iraqi goverment is still trying to throw out the shitty system of goverment that was enforced upon them by the us . 
  he doesnt say its only the us at fault , but they are obviously at fault still . 
  only lybia was a european project , everything else was us lead . 
  populism . 
  or maybe , just maybe he took a look how the last few military intervenitions worked out and came to the conclusion that they killed a shitton of people and in the end only made the situation worse for everybody . 
  if he 'd be escaping war , he would be in italy and he would want to go back once the war is over . 
  is isnt in italy and he doesnt want to go back .
