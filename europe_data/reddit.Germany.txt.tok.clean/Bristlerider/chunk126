  payment plans are rippoffs because they dont explicitly say how much you pay for the phone and how much you pay for the service . 
  the issue isnt people buying a phone on a loan , the issue is people taking a loan with conditions they arent aware off . 
  if they would split the monthly rate and say ; x % is for the service , y % is for the phone , z % are interests rate for the phone loan , it would be fair . 
  but they sell you a package and hope you are too dumb to use a calculator to check what you buy . 
   in eu/us you get a free smarphone of your choice with a payment plan . 
  ahh , another marketing victim . 
  a payment plan is essentially a loan for a smartphone . 
  most of the cost of the plan covers the phone you got `` for free '' . 
  and in my experience , its financially illiterate showoffs that buy `` free '' phones and then pay 35-50 bucks a month for 2 years . 
  thats 840-1200 euro in case you were wondering . 
  most people that have the slightest clue of how shit works buy the phone they want and get a contract for 5-10 bucks a month . 
  honestly , putin isnt as crazy as trump or erdogan . 
  he doesnt seem like he is a thin skinned moron . 
  hell he didnt go on a mad tirade on how evil europe is whenever somebody hurt his feelings . 
  he just send his troll factory thugs to mess with europe behind the scenes . 
  that doesnt make him a nice person , if anything it means he is a bigger threat . 
  but it also means he is more pragmatic and less likely to go full nero and burn everything down for shits and giggles . 
  as long as there is business to be had , putin will probably prefer business over ego . 
  i mean he will still try to fuck europe at every possible opportunity behind the scenes . 
  but he wont be a raving madman that sacrifices economic interests to compensate for that fact that daddy never loved him . 
  but that just cements the status quo . 
  which might have been good this time , but can backfire just as hard on other occasions . 
  there is no replacement for a healthy debate culture and education . 
  if a countries political climate is poisened by populism and partisan politics , the country is fucked anyway . 
  doctoring poll and referendum results wont change that . 
   on another note , david cameron is arguably the worst prime minister in history for opening this pandora 's box so casually !, 
  no he isnt . 
  cameron didnt lead the uk out of the eu . 
  he gave the people a choice . 
  his failure isnt allowing the vote . 
  his failure is that he blamed the eu for random shit to play political games . 
  the referendum wasnt exactly the best idea , but it wasnt bad either . 
  the propaganda and decades of selfish politicians taking credit for everything good while deflecting credit for everything bad to the eu were the problem . 
  the insane incompetence of the remain campaign also didnt help . 
  definitions change . 
  modern democracies obviously work very differently than democracies in the past . 
  the very existance of mass media means democratic systems need to be very different from ancient greece . 
  so yes its perfectly logical to say that ancient greece was a democracy , while demanding higher standards from nations that want to be called a democracy in our time . 
  people are jerking off to buzzwords ? 
  i guess since autocrats like to paint their regimes as democracies and it would be too much work to argue with every single one of them , people just say `` liberal democracy '' to contrast against those regimes . 
  in reality , those regimes arent democracies to begin with and i personally dont see any point in buying their propaganda that : people voting = democracy . 
  the question is : why do you buy the propaganda of dictators and autocrats ? 
  no its not . 
  democracy must contain certain measures to prevent it from killing itself by the next election . 
  democracy as a system cant exist without it . 
  this includes : special consideration for minorities , free press , freedom to assemble/demonstrate , etc. 
  democracy doesnt end with a piece of paper in a ballot box . 
  there is no non liberal democracy . 
  she decided to be erdogans pawn and allowed herself to be used for propaganda . 
  she deserves no pitty . 
  if anything its quite likely she supports erdogan and his referendum . 
   because akp needs more yes votes in the referendum . 
  akp 's propaganda methods may not be as obvious to europeans but we got used to this . 
  so why should we care ? 
  if turkey wants the sultan , they can have it . 
  you cant expect the eu to bow down and suck up everything this morons throws our way just to make sure we 're not being mean and hurt some random turks feelings . 
  turkey got and will get what they deserve . 
  if anything its quite nice that erdogan holds this referendum . 
  just like the trump election , it will make it perfectly clear what the country wants . 
  its his only leverage against the eu . 
  if he blows it , it might hurt europe . 
  but it also means all bets are off . 
  you have to keep in mind that the eu is very slow because it always has to consider the interest of 27 members . 
  right now erdogan can play eu members against eachother as some would be hit harder by refugee waves than others . 
  there is also no true consensus on how to deal with the refugee issue yet . 
  once he gives that up and screws over europe intentionally and clearly visible for everybody , the eu would be much more united against turkey and there would be significant political and public pressure to drown turkey in its own idiocy . 
  turkey cant afford to alienate the eu completely . 
  even erdogan should know that . 
  what you say might be true . 
  but wikipedia has to say this on venture capital :  venture capital firms or funds invest in these ** early-stage companies ** in exchange for equity -- an ownership stake -- in the companies they invest in . 
  venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky ** start-ups ** in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful . 
  so i am not sure how this works in the uk . 
  but shouldnt a uk party leader try to keep the uk together , rather than encourage splitting it ? 
  and opening the gates would be the best thing he can do for europe . 
  we have taken less than 2 million so far and already introduced a lot of new policies to stop the flow . 
  if erdogan unleashes 3 million syrians the eu would be froced into much more drastic measures , most likely solving the refugee issue permanently . 
  the eu might be a slow , bureaucratic mess , but a kick in the face like this would certainly speed things up . 
  especially in a year with elections in france and germany . 
  not enough to prevent the current state of affairs . 
  but its not that simple . 
  being in debt to somebody gives them influence on you . 
  its a bit of a slippery slope . 
  you dont want to gamble an election on which politician can drum up more foreign support . 
  you always want to shut out outside influences of any kind as much as possible during elections . 
  even if its just a loan . 
  there are banks and other companies in europe with a balance sheet that exceeds the national budget of certain member states . 
  its just too much leverage to give them the option to push their agenda by financing campaigns . 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/campaign-finance/ trump spend close to a billion usd as well . 
  the us system cant be compared . 
  since the supreme court killed the donation limit , politicians are practically forced to rake in billions to have any chance in hell to get elected . 
  european politicians dont need this , so their supporters dont pressure as hard for donations . 
   also funny that it 's not the russians , like with le pen . 
  doesnt really make a difference . 
  politicians shouldnt be allowed to take any donations or even loans from foreign benefactors . 
  which would weaken the v4 group and would greatly weaken polands position in europe . 
  it wont be long before the general population in africa grows to the point of where we dont need a war to get a refugee crisis . 
  the eu , if not all of europe needs a permanent solution for refugees . 
  either reduce the pull factors or simply get rid of subsidiary protection completely . 
   are you saying these terror suspects should be able to stay ? 
  well : yes .
