  france could build amphibious assault ships and not sell them to despots for once, 
  3 of these 5 types are german leopard tanks . 
  yes they are not identical , but its not like they have use 5 completely different tanks from 5 different manufacturers . 
  the article also says that the old us tanks are to be replaced with leopards . 
  so even greece will be down to using only versions of the leopard in the near future . 
  the only thing that will acomplish is making sure they never come back . 
  this goes beyond the extend of what you think happened in the us . 
  it would be very surprising if an us billionaire that supports trump randomnly used this tech in the uk , but not for his posterboy at home . 
  length and width of a ship cost a lot of money and make it slower or less agile . 
  going up should be cheaper . 
  also gives you a great view . 
  germany will never have an actual , full sized aircraft carrier . 
  it makes 0 sense to have one . 
  egypt also only has amphibious assault ships . 
  algeria has something similar , but their ships are so tiny that they are barely larger than a german f125 frigate . 
  its also the us that do not want a military pressence in ee no matter what . 
  poland has afaik asked for bases many times already . 
  the us could easily move one of their useless bases in germany further east . 
  but they dont , because they dont care . 
  honestly , this line is pure propaganda . 
  gabriel knows , or should know , that absolutely nobody in europe would mind . 
  most of europe has been begging us for years to do this . 
  this line is just intended to give the impression that they thought of all the implications and got it all figured out . 
  i can assure you they have not . 
  its kinda not our problem though . 
  `` the west '' cant save the world . 
  even if we wanted to . 
  a weird decision . 
  the eu already has a massively larger military budget than russia . 
  if anything , the only problem is a lack of coordination . 
  so rather than work on that , we increase the budget even though it wont do shit . 
  i mean there are really only 2 options : budget is everything , in which case we already `` won '' . 
  or budget isnt everything , in which case its largely pointless to drop another 15b for minimal gain . 
  he has a point though . 
  whats the difference between randomly killing people with drones whereever you please and domestic executions ? 
  at the end of the day its murder of people that ( probably ) commited crimes . 
  china at least gives their executions a ( token ) due process . 
  the us arent as bad as china in total , but they are mess and we should not depend on them at all . 
  if nothing else we need the option to trade with china so we can play them against one another and get the best deal for ourself . 
  actually , china is very reliable . 
  thats about the only thing they can offer us and the reason we trade with them . 
  they certainly arent out friends and dont give a shit about us outside of the fact that they want our technology and need a market for their products . 
  but they are reliable . 
  a well oiled dictatorship that is much more stable than most . 
  its not like we have much choice in our trading partners . 
  every relevant tradingpartner out there has done monstrous things they do not regrett at all . 
  its just a matter of picking our pioson . 
  they could always insist on the use of organic meat , or actually come up with regulations to make meat production less of a mess . 
  but that would be work , so lets stick with symbolic acts that are completely useless . 
  bread is arguably much more important than the wurst , certainly more important than the currywurst . 
  the point is that sweden will in fact struggle to deal with the migrants . 
  few people would really argue this point . 
  which makes it so easy to spin into some apocalyptic story about marauding gangs of brown people raping women in the streets , or whatever the current delusion trumps gang is spreading . 
  and yet , the us and china , both of which are markets of comparable or smaller size than the eu/efta , manage to enforce much more drastic regulations on companies . 
  hell companies go out of their way to hand their technology over to their direct competition in china just to get access to its market . 
  and the chinese market is still not as developed as efta . 
  `` do this or you dont get to run your business in france '' . 
  just like google has to enforce us regulations globally . 
  if done properly , the law would also work the other way and essentially force any company that wants to do business in france to respect human rights everywhere in the world . 
  hell we could use regulations like this eu wide . 
  i mean i get their point . 
  but at the end of the day , this means that labels are more important to them than rights . 
  at this point , its not really a civil rights issue anymore . 
  strongman politicians make much more sense if you dont have to live under the boots of their thugs . 
  germany also got the uneducated turks in the 70 . 
  we needed them to do the most basic work after all . 
  the educated and more secular ones went to other places like the us that had much stricter migration rules . 
  and since there was never any attemp to integrate the turks in germany , well we screwed ourselves pretty badly . 
  germans dont want to be bothered with politics . 
  most want `` stability '' in the sense of nothing bad or even important on the news . 
  same sex marriage is something important and some people oppose it . 
  that means it would be effort to argue about it and whatnot . 
  people dont care about it , they want to be left alone and make money . 
  merkel is in office for 10 years because has no drive of her own . 
  she doesnt touch any political subject until its been discussed to death or cant be kept out of the news anymore . 
  at the end of the day , this particular issue doesnt really matter . 
  i 'm 100 % sure same sex couples consider themselves married in germany , regardless of what the fine print says . 
  i personally would just refer to a womens same sex partner as her wive and a guys same sex partner as his husband too . 
  trivial crap like this really doesnt need to be here . 
  300 jobs are nothing . 
   initial costs high , afterwards its so much better than anything else , except for coal yeah , lets talk about the cost of nuclear power : insurance :  the worst case nuclear accident costs are so large that it would be difficult for the private insurance industry to carry the size of the risk , and the premium cost of full insurance ** would make nuclear energy uneconomic ** . 
   it is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economics_of_nuclear_power_plants#capital_costs especially this : what the plant operator must pay for a large scale incident :  the vienna convention was adapted in 2004 to increase the operator liability to $ 700 million per incident , but this modification is not yet ratified . 
  [ 94 ] what a large scale incident actually costs :  the cost of the fukushima disaster cleanup is not yet known , but has been estimated to cost around $ 100 billion . 
  oh and this is also kind of amusing :  kristin shrader-frechette analysed 30 papers on the economics of nuclear power for possible conflicts of interest . 
  she found of the 30 , 18 had been funded either by the nuclear industry or pro-nuclear governments and were pro-nuclear , 11 were funded by universities or non-profit non-government organisations and were anti-nuclear , the remaining 1 had unknown sponsors and took the pro-nuclear stance . 
  the pro-nuclear studies were accused of using cost-trimming methods such as ignoring government subsides and using industry projections above empirical evidence where ever possible . 
  basically : out of 30 papers , 18 were bought by the industry . 
  out of the 12 neutral papers 11 ended up with an anti nuclear power stance . 
  its pretty funny when people with no clue try to shit on this . 
  nuclear power simply does not make sense in germany . 
  we do not have deposits for long term storage . 
  in fact the last attempt of building one will now cost us 10b , to get the radioactive material out again . 
  the mine isnt stable . 
  with no long term perspective for dealing with the waste and the generally very high cost , it makes sense to phase out nuclear power . 
  you havent read my post at all . 
  i explicitly said that his goals and projects dont matter at all . 
  his methods are the problem . 
  his `` everybody that isnt with me is a traitor '' rethoric is the problem . 
  he has the classic dictator mindset that he ** is ** the state , rather than the guy elected to run it for a while .
