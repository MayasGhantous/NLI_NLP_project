  and yes this counts for every person and every nation . 
  debts are not just a numbers game , treating them as such is foolish . 
  greece pays the price for taking risks with its national debts , and now somebody has to pay up . 
  i say let greece pay . 
  would you feel better if i gave you the hypocritical , backstabbing press release style version that essentially says the same but talks a lot about saving greece ? 
  a grexit is the best solution for both sides right now , especially if the imf walks out of the negotiations without debt cuts . 
  just like you paid the price for the tens of thousands of innocents that were killed in the name of american freedom ? 
  i can live with this kind of penance . 
  i want a grexit . 
  i do not care how its done . 
  i would prefer a nice grexit based on a agreement between greece and the ez . 
  but if greece refuses i dont mind humiliating them until they cant take it anymore and leave . 
  i mean the greeks could gain a lot if they were willing to put a grexit on the table and squeeze whatever possible out of the ez for doing so . 
  they are protesters , they are mostly against something . 
  its quite likely that most of them have no clue and just think that austerity is very , very mean . 
  the good , old `` hitler ate sugar '' argument . 
  lets just ignore public opinion whenever it doesnt fit into our way of thinking ? 
  the point is that he prefers a default/grexit over bailouts . 
  since the official position of germany says bailouts , he does his job and negotiates them anyway . 
  well for once : a haircut would get the imf on board for negotiations again . 
  after all they mostly care about the raw debt to gpd ratio which would indeed improve even by cutting low interest long term loans . 
  so by cutting long term loans , greece could ( re ) gain access to short term bridging loans from the imf . 
  that should actually help . 
  i dont see sch\u00e4uble go back on his word , especially not in a case like this . 
  and ultimately , we can write up a nice big contract/treaty to make sure both sides know what they are expected to do and what they can expect to get out of it . 
  the point is that merkel said she wants to get rid of the differences and discrimination towards civil partnerships . 
  so assuming she wasnt lying about that ... 
  actually , he should talk about it a lot more . 
  if greece can be talked into a grexit by offering them something for it , we can save us the hypocritical bullshit of a bailout we 're forcing onto them . 
  that would be a substantial improvement of how these negotiations are run . 
  thats what i 've been saying for a while now . 
  debt cuts if greece leaves the euro . 
  the ez would get rid of the greek problem and greece could get the debt relief they need . 
  its basically a nicer version of a default . 
  taxes for being in jail i guess . 
  i dont think so . 
  her outfits fit her backround as a gdr politician/academic . 
  well they used to , she did eventually get some help or figured out something herself . 
  it probably was a pr stunt , but merkel isnt nearly as detached and shielded from the world as most other leaders of powerful nations/economies . 
   incentives on paying taxes how about pay up or go to jail ? 
  thats how everybody else does it btw . 
  you make it sound like forcing people to pay their taxes is some sort of crime . 
  the fact that simple things like this are even a matter of discussion is very weird and a big part of the greek problem . 
  and yes i agree with you that this current bailout wont be enough to actually bring greece back on track . 
  but then again you can start to issue ious anytime . 
  no , because there will be no legal difference , no discrimination . 
  there will simply be 2 different legal terms that wont matter at all because everybody will most likely use the term marriage anyway . 
  go troll somebody else . 
  but is it really discrimination if marriage and civil partnerships are equal before the law and merely come with a different name ? 
  because thats what merkel wants to do as it seems . 
  tell me , do you actually believe that this deal will help getting greece back on track ? 
  do you really think that draining liquidity from a contracting economy to pay the goverments debts will actually do anything for greece ? 
  you realize that merkel will rather have the ez burned down than to give in to any such demands precisely because she knows spain will be the next to make demands ? 
  if anything a leftist goverment in spain will kill any pro eu and euro sentiment in the north eastern ez nations and fracture europe even more . 
  i 'm curious , is the situation in slovenia actually as positive as the article says ? 
  how did the reforms affect the daily life ? 
  if all corrupt and incompetent politicians would have to shut up , we wouldnt even get a monologue in most parliament sessions . 
  its not about personal preferences , its about legal implications . 
  as far as i am concerned , all relationships should be equal before the law . 
  the only difference is obviously having children . 
  i would actually prefer if most legal benefits of marriage and civil partnerships are simply cut or moved to couples with children ( regardless of source ) . 
  this way nobody would give a damn about who other people fuck . 
  and in this case , both are right . 
  greece will not get the support it would need to get back into shape . 
  they cant change that either , its just how it is . 
  the only logical choice is a grexit to rebuild on their own terms . 
  if they refuse to accept this they will not only have a few really bad years , they will basically become dependant on the whims of foreign politicians . 
  it ultimately depends on how imports and exports work . 
  if imports come mostly from other euro nations while exports go to non ez nations a weak euro would still be beneficial . 
  the opposite could happen ofc . 
  they simply get more euros for every dollar of profits they make . 
  ( for example ) if the euro would suddenly lose 50 % of its value , the export industry would make twice as much because they get double the euros when trading their dollar/yuan/whatever profits to euro . 
  so effectively , greece celebrated a moral victory over corrupt elites . 
  while at the same time burning the bridges that might have lead to an actually beneficial agreement . 
   `` exhibiting or feeling great or offensive ** satisfaction ** with oneself or with one 's situation ; ** self-righteously complacent ** '' you achieved nothing actually beneficial , but celebrated that vividly . 
  tell me , what did greece get out of the no vote ? 
  the problem is that syriza promised the impossible feat of keeping the euro while evading austerity . 
  that was never an option and created illusions that were eventually shattered and caused this feeling of defeat . 
  sure syriza managed to get the `` old , corrupt elites '' out of the goverment . 
  but ultimately the promises made to do that destroyed the bridges between greece and the ez . 
  if you thought saying no to this proposal would get you a better deal , you were wrong . 
  you never did understand your own position . 
  sure you might drag the ez as a whole down with you , that could happen i guess . 
  but i am not sure how much being smug is worth once your economy collapses and your nation turns into a 3rd world mess . 
  operation : grexit i guess, 
  i will gladly take responsibility for the actions of my goverment once they kicked greece hard enough to force a grexit . 
  and the loans we gave greece are gone , we will never get them back regardless of what happens now . 
  the greek economy will go nowhere with the current bailout agreement . 
  the imf mostly wants a positive long term development before they invest further money . 
  meanwhile the ez/eu either wants to burn down greece or force them out of the euro , not so sure about whats the plan right now . 
  i mean its not nice i guess . 
  but damn if it gets you jobs , shouldnt you be fine with that ? 
  not immediately . 
  on the other hand : do you really think the deal greece got will have any positive effects whatsoever for the greek economy and has even the slightest chance to help greece back on track ? 
  i 'm confused but i guess the downvotes mean this guy isnt actually being sarcastic ?!, 
  which , contrary to what one would think when following cdu politics , doesnt stand for confused btw . 
  well german allows you to chain nouns endlessly so we might get some hilarious bureaucratic creation out of this mess . 
  its usually about religious arguments and `` true families '' . 
  not sure why merkel even cares , she has a religious backround in her family but is usually pragmatic . 
  maybe she wants to appease the hardliners and traditionalists in her party .
