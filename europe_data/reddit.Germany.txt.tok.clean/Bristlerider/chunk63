  i just expect them to offer some more `` traditional '' meals with pork/beef or whatever is traditional in the area . 
  its a bit ironic that the evil righties have to speak up for diversity . 
  it really doesnt matter how strict their asylum policy is on paper . 
  they still didnt bother to make sure we can deport people properly until the nye events drew public attention to this issue . 
  they still dont bother to do anything to stop the migrant waves we are currently facing . 
  laws my ass , the results speak a very different language that is far away from `` we have just got the strictest asylum laws germany had '' . 
  merkel had plenty of time to make sure we actually have a very strict migration policy in practice . 
  but she didnt do shit until her popularity crashed . 
  their current migration policy certainly is . 
  i mean it doesnt really matter what the cdu wants anyway . 
  more than any political program they want power , merkel can ensure they will lead the goverment so the party follows her no matter what . 
  they whine about it , sure . 
  and now that merkels popularity is crashing they whine a little more than usual . 
  but talk is cheap . 
  thats to be expected though . 
  i know a lot of people like the public broadcasters in germany for ridiculous reasons like that they try to buy football licenses and whatnot . 
  but those public broadcasts are basically state tv , its just the organisation that is a little different because our constitution afaik doesnt allow state media . 
  i mean not only is the board of those broadcaster picked by politicians that will always place members of their own party in positions of power , by now this whole organisation is also basically tax founded . 
  always assume any public broadcaster in germany has a massive pro goverment bias . 
  it could be used as a base for other cases and allow other people to take their own goverment to court over surveillance matters . 
  damn i am just glad it isnt a case against poland , that would have been oil into the fire . 
  good to see the ehrc still values privacy though . 
  the whole point of schools is to ensure a baseline education for everybody , even those that dont care to inquire on their own . 
  sure if you are a genius child you might learn math on your own . 
  but we still teach it in school because most kids arent like that . 
  there is no need to suspend debt . 
  leave the ez , issue a new currency and inflate your way out of the shit you are in currently . 
   the eurozone does n't want that , because it would fuck the eurozone . 
  wrong . 
  the ez was pretty close to dropping greece . 
  a lot of ez members supported the german hard line position . 
  ultimately , it was the greek goverment that prevented varoufakis from distributing a new currency . 
  tge greek goverment didnt have the balls to leave the euro . 
  if only there was an option to fix this , like getting a local currency again . 
  the police is also aware that african gangs of about 2200 people have been robbing people in cologne for years . 
  they can give you a rather exact number , but they cant do shit about it . 
  since the attackers from nye seem to be part of these gangs , its not really shocking that the police doesnt get anywhere with its investigations . 
   so genocides are fine so long as the way it was carried out was strong and cunning ? 
  too bad germany went for the efficient genocide rather than the strong and cunning genocide . 
  have to remember that in case we elect some austrian nutbob again . 
  no point in having a merry genocide if you dont get good press for it huh ? 
  its a shame really , because the holocaust seems quite efficient . 
  uhh , whops . 
  how can belarus have a better rating than russia ? 
  that seems weird . 
   technically , would n't it be somewhat really counter-productive genetically ( and logistically ) speaking if a large population of inbred humans were intentionally kept alive to inbreed some more ? 
  technically , yes that might be counter productive . 
  practically , no doctor will ever dare to refuse helping a patient because this patient should be purged from the gene pool for the greater good . 
  not sure if this is biased or not , but it certainly makes leaving rather unappealing . 
  it takes a while until this happens . 
  also : modern medicine can keep people alive and well for quite some time . 
  if somebody with health issues caused by inbreeding lives long enough to have children , it doesnt really matter if they die as far as inbreeding goes . 
  its actually quite shocking that this can happen to such a degree in modern europe though . 
  are you saying that bad salaries equal slavery ? 
  about insurance :  the worst case nuclear accident costs are so large that it would be difficult for the private insurance industry to carry the size of the risk , and the premium cost of full insurance ** would make nuclear energy uneconomic ** . 
   it is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economics_of_nuclear_power_plants#capital_costs especially this : what the plant operator must pay for a large scale incident :  the vienna convention was adapted in 2004 to increase the operator liability to $ 700 million per incident , but this modification is not yet ratified . 
  [ 94 ] what a large scale incident actually costs :  the cost of the fukushima disaster cleanup is not yet known , but has been estimated to cost around $ 100 billion . 
  oh and this is also kind of amusing :  kristin shrader-frechette analysed ** 30 papers ** on the economics of nuclear power for possible conflicts of interest . 
  she found of the 30 , 18 had been funded either by the nuclear industry or pro-nuclear governments and were pro-nuclear , 11 were funded by universities or non-profit non-government organisations and were anti-nuclear , the remaining 1 had unknown sponsors and took the pro-nuclear stance . 
  the pro-nuclear studies were accused of using cost-trimming methods such as ignoring government subsides and using industry projections above empirical evidence where ever possible . 
  basically : out of 30 papers , 18 were bought by the industry . 
  out of the 12 neutral papers 11 ended up with an anti nuclear power stance . 
  but ig metal members dont make the news because employees took their boss hostage or attacked a corporate executive after he announced a layoff . 
   sweden has a complete , permanent final deposit solution , 100 % funded , just waiting to be built . 
  one city has already accepted to host it . 
  but thats the issue isnt it ? 
  germany doesnt have a deposit . 
  its easy to talk about how great nuclear power is if your country has a solid plan of how to deal with the waste . 
  but as i said , the problem in germany is that no state wants a deposit . 
  some states simply decide that they dont have the geography to host one , even though scientists say otherwise . 
  that is why its smart to get rid of nuclear power . 
  because * we * cant make it work . 
  good for you if * you * can . 
   if someone had good idea , so why he ca n't earn money ? 
  because billionares earning money at the expense of social security for a lot of people is very bad for society . 
  no nuclear powerplant was ever profitable without direct or indirect subsidies . 
  this is mostly done by having the state pay for the waste disposal and allowing absurdly small security deposits for incidents . 
  either way , we only have nuclear power because its massively subsidized . 
   germany is getting rid of it . 
  real smart decision , there . 
  actually , it is smart . 
  we still cant find a permanent deposit for nuclear waste because no state wants it in their territory . 
  and in my opinion , if you dont have a 100 % solution for the waste , you shouldnt run plants that produce it . 
  so lets hope this fusion technology is ready to take of in a few decades . 
  to be fair , at least from an outsiders perspective it seems like he would be hanged by a mob if he 'd try to do something that the unions dont like . 
  french unions are scary . 
   is n't germany looking to deport asylum seekers who attack women anyway , rather than granting them refugee status ? 
  in theory , maybe . 
  but i sort of doubt that this will be done properly . 
  doing so would probably mean a massively increased budget for local police units . 
  on the plus side , the `` tolerated '' status this trash has shouldnt allow naturalization as far as i know . 
  the plan is to cut their development aid if they dont cooperate . 
   whatever you may think of the calais camp or the current immigration crisis as a whole , it 's crucial to remember that ultimately we are dealing with desperate people , not animals ... we 're dealing with greedy people . 
  desperate people dont voluntarily chose to live into a shitty camp when they could simply register in france and get better accomodations . 
  every single person in this camp is an entitled opportunist that doesnt give a fuck about safety . 
  they want to leech their way into some fat welfare . 
  this is also where the district 9 analogy falls short . 
  afaik the aliens in the movie were actually stranded . 
  they didnt burn their ship so they could leech money on earth , then rioted when they didnt get enough money .
