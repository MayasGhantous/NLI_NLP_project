  funny that you call people extremists , you are one yourself . 
  yes it is actually possible to have an issue with the way a lot of muslim interpret islam , without being a racist . 
  you generalise just as much as those extremists . 
   not for that concentration camp remark though which implies he managed to top that by saying something worse . 
  it also means that a lot of people didnt just leave when the concentration camp stuff came up . 
  i dont get how you can stick around at a demonstration after he drops a bomb like that . 
  you cant support shit like this , even if you really hate merkel . 
   in the same way , just because a lot of the more extreme right turn up to these demonstrations , does n't mean everyone who has a problem with islam is the same . 
  its quite simple : the moment this guy starts to speak about concentration camps , you get to make a choice . 
  if your choice is to stay , you basically support him . 
  no amount of booing will fix that . 
  i agree that merkel fucked up big time and is an incompetent moron in general . 
  but you cant support this nazi filth , no matter what . 
  just for the records : pegida had a guy holding a speech that actually said : `` the concentration camps are unfortunately currently inoperative '' if you attend a demonstration with this kind of speakers , you really shouldnt cry about being labled anything . 
  dont worry , he made a good attempt , but was forced to confess in the end . 
   tom scott 6 hours ago the effects shot ( s ) in this one were quite difficult to pull off convincingly , and that 's all i 'm saying . 
  so the big questions is : who would have an interest in killing her ? 
  there is a difference between teaching and indoctrination . 
  you are right that bringing a young child to a gay pride parade is wrong , no child should be brought to a political demonstration of any kind . 
  just like its in my opinion wrong to introduce children to any kind of religion before they can decide if its what they want . 
  but its quite possible to socialise and teach kids while allowing them to develop their own personality . 
  which is their own fault . 
  if you dont want the eu , you can leave whenever you want . 
  but if you want to be in the eu , do your goddamn duty and vote . 
  i could have named martin schulz . 
  and its hardly the problem of the eu parliament if nobody cares . 
  the eu parliament is important , its the most important eu level authority . 
  as always , you decide whether or not you use your democratic rights of voting . 
  because its germany and nobody with a serious interest in political change will riot . 
  hell if you do , you are automatically called an extremist . 
  which i guess isnt entirely undeserved if you do riot in the streets . 
   which they eventually always do . 
  that 's the fucking problem . 
  if every single protest eventually devolves into that , then maybe the basic idea is flawed in the first place . 
  not really . 
  neonazis just like to hijack political startups . 
  they typically try this with every new party and every civil movement . 
  some of those movements are temped by having more people and fail to tell the actual nazis to fuck off . 
  in some other cases neonazi activity is just used to squash upcoming political competition . 
  you cant blame companies for trying to maximise their profits . 
  thats their entire purpose . 
  just accept that they will screw everbody and everything for profit and make sure to prevent them from screwing you with laws and regulations . 
  obama supports it still . 
  you cant blame others for something if you stand behind it as well . 
  if anything the problem in germany is that its hard to vote for a party that is not supporting merkel . 
  she faces next to no opposition in the parliament at the moment . 
  well you have the chance to vote for parties that will ultimately make merkel chancellor . 
  you can also vote for a party that refuses any kind of coalition while being a small party . 
  or vote for parties that wont make it into the parliament anyway . 
  mind you i took the later option , but its not like it does anything . 
  most germans arent actually interested in politics . 
  they prefer merkels stagnation , because making decisions is hard and you can be wrong and whatnot . 
  turkey said they have spend a total of ** 6,5 b ** ( news from september 2015 ) http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/15/us-mideast-crisis-migrants-turkey-analys-iduskcn0rf1px20150915 germany spends ** ~ 10b ** this year alone http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kosten-fuer-fluechtlinge-auf-zehn-milliarden-euro-geschaetzt-a-1051600.html cost per migrant per month in a certain city in germany ( around 1000 euro ) : http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/453565/umfrage/kosten-pro-fluechtling-und-monat-in-deutschland/ as it turns out , my ass still writes better posts than you do . 
  well our very own president deemed it necessary to divide germany into good and bad , basically good people and nazis . 
  thats about as close as it gets to germany saying something . 
   their economy is also much poorer than that of germany . 
  yet they have 2.5 million refugees and growing . 
  they dont spend any relevant money though . 
  even while hosting this much refugees , turkey has spend less money overall then germany spend this year alone on a much smaller number . 
  mind you i dont blame them , but you have to get your facts straight . 
   they think that anything is possible if you believe in it , no matter how irealistic it is thats one part , the other part is a population of morons that want to be politically correct and feel moraly superior . 
  people wanted the politicians to do this . 
  too many germans give too many fucks about being nice and feeling superior too those evil racists from the balkans . 
  it was 100 % obvious that this shit would backfire , there was no chance at all that it would work . 
  the isps have also already admitted that they dont just store metadata . 
  metadata is bad enough , but they also store the full text of sms for `` technical reasons '' for at least a week . 
  you might have noticed that the 2 major problems for europe this year were problems that must be solved on an eu level . 
  the refugee crisis cant be solved by every nation on their own , neither can the still lingering financial crisis be solved by any one nation . 
  sure , you dont care because the uk noped out of everything as always . 
  but for the rest of us , an eu based solution for these issues would be great . 
  since the uk is one of the main reasons why we cant get eu based solution for these problems , a brexit would actually help fixing an immediate problem . 
  mind you i can also live with the opposite : dial back the eu to a free trade zone and move forward politically with the ez . 
  but ultimately we need to move forward and centralise certain things . 
  at the very least fiscal politics and foreign politics . 
  the uk is politically irrelevant for the eu because they are against basically everything that smells like it could lead to centralisation . 
  they simply arent nearly as invested and interested in the project as germany and france . 
  its not something negative either , its simply their choice . 
  the uk were never really invested into the eu . 
  if anything , getting rid of the uk will allow us to do what it takes to fix europe . 
  yes it would be a loss for the eu . 
  but i 'd rather cut my losses now and move on than stagnate until europe actually breaks apart because we cant move forward . 
  the other option would be to give up or dial back the eu by a huge margin and move forward with the ez . 
  which is actually not a bad option i 'd say . 
  ez members are already more invested anyway . 
  well he should ask the us too . 
  there was a news a few days ago that after the russians started bombing rebell groups , some of them miraculously got their hands on american missile or rocket systems . 
  good , old us arming ~ ~ terrorists ~ ~ ehh freedom fighters again . 
  no surprise they are still best friends with saudi arabia , they are in the same business . 
  how does that take away from my point that you cant vote against the current goverment without voting for extremists ? 
  so you do that , and find out that short of having a very , very fast carreer to the top of the party ( or at the very least to the top of the party in your state ) , your voice means next to nothing . 
  and then what ? 
  to be honest , it is . 
  the npd is really bad at hiding their neonazi ideology and the afd just had a split where the founder and most liberals left . 
  nobody knows just where they stand right now , its quite possible they are close to the npd too . 
   the core of the issue is that people confuse parliamentary representation with having a personal puppet in the parliament , or preferably government . 
  the problem is that you can not vote against migration and you can not vote against merkel at the moment . 
  so what are people supposed to do ? 
  create their own party just so that there is any alternative to the ridiculous mainstream ? 
  this attack cant be justified , but german politics are extremely fucked up at the moment . 
  well it is a correct assessment .
