   muslims bear no responsibility for 9-11 , london , madrid , beslan , bali ( i & ii ) , mumbai , and all the other recent incidences of islamic terrorism ? 
  they are completely innocent of these crimes ? 
  osama is the result of billions of saudi dollars . 
  i described to you above , why the terrorism and extremist muslim problem is the result of strong western support of midieval regimes that would be long gone , had it not been for us . 
   your professors must be proud of you . 
  you are the perfect finished product of the modern humanities narrative ... a self-hating westerner who blames all the worlds ills on the west . 
  may god help you . 
  what does that have to do with education ? 
  are you against education and knowledge ? 
  against science ? 
  that would fit your political views . 
  i did study business , btw . 
  and why should i be self-hating ? 
  osama is a bad guy . 
  he could only become so big by outside help . 
  without us , he would still be bad , though not as big . 
  but i do n't see that as evil . 
  it is an unintended consequence . 
  also i do n't think the west is evil as such . 
  it 's just not good . 
  western countries do whatever benefits them . 
  if a couple millions here or there perish , if billions more live under brutal regimes , so be it . 
  and as i said : the resurgance of extreme islam was never planned . 
  it was just a result of a convenient was to get oil . 
  why is that self hating ? 
  sooo , not only do you want to make a muslim in europe responsible for some stuff another person ( who also happens to be muslim ) is doing in nigeria right now , but you also want to make them responsible for every single thing any muslim ever did in history ? 
  yes , i am german . 
  but i am not personal responsible for what hitler did . 
  or the inquisition . 
  or whatever . 
  not my business . 
  it does n't have anything remotely to do with who i am now . 
  you keep wanting to nail muslims to the cross , because of some nutcases that want to wear the burqa . 
  and the worst part is : those nutcases are supported by our governments . 
  they would n't have anything , would n't it be for our financial and military support . 
  and those nutcases create huge problems for muslims in their countries by blowing up stuff and enforcing their nutcase ideology . 
  all thanks to us . 
  if you take a single second to look beyond your own labels , you would realize , that those nutcases are our guys more than they are their guys . 
  a muslim in europe has as much to do with a muslim in nigeria as you have with kony and brevik . 
  or hitler for that matter . 
  that is my whole point . 
  if you keep lumping that together , other people will do so as well . 
  with other groups . 
  some of which will apply to you . 
   what in the world does this have to do with `` black people '' ? 
  we are talking about a religion/culture . 
  i would suspect that most sub-saharan , african immigrants to europe make wonderful contributions to european culture . 
  on the one hand , you deny it , but on the other hand you keep doing it . 
  you keep putting all muslims in one group . 
  like all blacks . 
  which is the example i was trying to make . 
  islam is a religion/culture as much as it simply is a place of origin . 
  if you come from a certain country , chances are you are muslim . 
  if you come from a certain country , chances are you are black . 
   i 'm merely pointing out the linkage between islamic theology/tradition and the actions of muslims . 
  you try and interpret islam the way some extremist nutcase would do . 
  that is is all violence and fascism . 
  just like anyone could interpret christianity . 
  i just tried to point out the errors in it . 
  is it in the scriptures ? 
  christians also have crazy scriptures . 
  is it in the culture ? 
  our christian or even enlightened culture brought forth hitler . 
  is it today ? 
  there is kony . 
  trying to pin the problem of terrorism on all muslims is racist . 
  and wrong . 
  just like trying to pin brevik to all europeans . 
  there is no `` secret linkage '' . 
  this is conspiracy crap . 
  there is no 9-11 conspiracy either for that matter . 
   as for your absurd linkage to hitler , his ideology was entirely antithetical to western/christian values . 
  the western/christian world played an essential role in destroying his vile regime . 
  your average european muslim would say the same about osama . 
   in our political and academic discourse in the west , we are constantly exposing and revisiting our own historical sins ... imperialism , colonialism , the native american genocide , the atlantic slave-trade , etc. ... and rightly so . 
  these historical sins should be exposed , discussed , deconstructed . 
   but why can there be no commensurate exposition of the historical sins of islam ? 
  why ca n't we rationally discuss the hindu and armenian genocides , the muslim slave-trade , islamic imperialism , etc ? 
  why is this particular historical investigation off-limits ? 
  why is it `` hate '' to engage in critical scrutiny of islamic theology/culture ? 
  nothing is off limits . 
  if it stays in history . 
  but this is not a discussion of history , but of today . 
  you were the one that started the discussion with some racist shit . 
  all western women would need or want to wear scarfs in all muslim countries . 
  and my favourite so far :  why ca n't they take the same accommodating attitude about our culture ? 
  this sentence is very racist in almost every context . 
  for example : why ca n't black people behave themselves in our country ? 
  we behave in their country . 
  muslims ** are ** part of europe . 
  they ** are ** part of ** us ** . 
  ** our ** culture . 
  besides , as i already pointed out . 
  extreme religious views were driven out of most muslim countries in the 50s and 60s by nationalistic views in the aftermath of the decolonization struggle and is now making a resurgance . 
  why ? 
  but i partly blame oil money . 
  saudi arabia , for example , is a close ally of western countries that spends a lot of money spreading ** very ** extreme religious stuff . 
  they do this under our protection . 
  we shielded them from nationalistic saddam hussein in 1990 , when saddam took over kuweit and threatened the saudi kingdom . 
  most muslim terrorists hit muslims themselves ( upwards of 90 % casulties are muslims or something like that ? ) .
