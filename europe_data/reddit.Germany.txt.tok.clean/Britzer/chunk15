  and they are ideologically motivated by our allies in arabia . 
  probabely also financed by them . 
  so these terrorists that you try to pin on muslism ? 
  our guys actually . 
  killing mostly muslims . 
  and you are trying to blame them for that . 
  and because of these reasons , most of the more educated muslims actually have a lot of righteous hate for the west . 
  thank god they ca n't do jack . 
  so it 's a numbers game ? 
  if a thousand more christians would support kony , it would be bad ? 
  if more extreme christians would bomb abortian clinics , christianity would be on equal footing ? 
  how about six million jews ? 
  is that a number we can live with ? 
  how many jihadists do you need to outweigh the atrocities a christian , yet enlightened germany committed in the 1940s ? 
  you do n't want to play the numbers game . 
  you loose . 
  buddhists ? 
  japanese ? 
  the ones that raped shanghai ? 
  but muslims are the bad ones , right ? 
   i 'm not saying that muslims living in germany are responsible for the actions of muslims in egypt but you are ranting and raving against all muslism . 
  including the ones here in germany . 
  you little wannabe breivik . 
  reddit is somewhat representative . 
  i would even say of the more cosmopolitan side . 
  people that speak english and traverse the internet . 
   you refereed to the whole continent of europe as racist go through this subreddit . 
  read it . 
  count the up - and downvotes . 
  and then come back . 
   as for kony , he was african . 
  what in the world have i to do with him ? 
  you keep lumping people from all over the world together , because they are muslim . 
  so i put you on the spot for kony . 
  he is christian . 
  if any or all muslims are responsible for what is happening in egypt ( except for the very people that do it ) , if any arbitrary group is responsible , i can take any different example . 
  you know what : if you ever bought a smartphone , you are indirectly responsible for the genocide in the drc . 
  how about that ? 
  you belong to the smartphone owning/buying/selling / producing group . 
  i have to correct myself . 
  this sentence is xenophobic in almost any context . 
   tolerance in europe compared to that in the islamic realm . 
  this is an examination of culture . 
  you are certainly showing a lot of tolerance ... and painfully reading part of your comment :  how many muslims have been killed in inter-communal violence there over the last two decades ? 
  any at all ? 
  4 or 5 maybe ? 
  you are a fucking idiot . 
  and you are totally responsible for kony 2012 . 
  ok , let 's try to explain . 
  i know i am not making it any better , but i feel like i am talking to a three year old . 
  this sentence , regardless context , ist racist :  why ca n't they take the same accommodating attitude about our culture ? 
  why ca n't / can/don ' t they yadda , yadda , yadda our something . 
  why ca n't they respect our values . 
  why ca n't they work for their income and consume our income ? 
  or , to put it more directly , why do you take german money ? 
  why do you piigs take our money ? 
  ca n't you work for yourself ? 
  give me back my money and get out of eu !, 
  that is racist , xenophobic , whatever , regardless of context . 
  because what do you individual have to do with someone from greece ? 
  are you responsible for all actions of your government ? 
  or a group in your country ? 
   state your arguements against it instead . 
  this is not 1st grade . 
  ouch !, 
  why do you wear pants ? 
  i just substituted islamophobia with racism . 
  basically it 's the same shit . 
  `` brown people are bad because of their culture . '', 
  it was never about skin color . 
  always about their `` inferior culture '' . 
  this sentence , without any context :  why ca n't they take the same accommodating attitude about our culture ? 
   what were the racist undertones ? 
  i would n't even know where to start . 
  let 's start with the identity . 
  while germany is currently shitting itself over privacy concerns in the prism scandal , this guy wants to identify each and every person that walks in public . 
  so ban motorcycle helmets ? 
  surgical masks ? 
  britain already has cameras in almost all public spaces . 
  with facial recognition , big brother always knows where you are . 
  yet the burqa is suddenly a problem because of the identity ? 
  really ?? 
   furthermore , i wonder why it 's never discussed why non-muslim women feel compelled to wear headscarves in muslim-majority countries . 
  we always just give the situation a pass by saying , `` well , that 's their culture ; when in rome '' ... . why ca n't they take the same accommodating attitude about our culture ? 
  if you do n't find the openly racist shit in this one , i ca n't help you . 
  well , maybe i can give you a hint : [ you see all the headscarves on the beach in \u00c9gypt ? ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=egypt+summer+vacation&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:unofficial&amp;client=iceweasel-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=de&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=rmsyusprasaqtaajnodgaw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=738&amp;sei=sgsyury3eslqtaazyycgcg#fp=5e3e58997ec3e5f7&amp;hl=de&amp;q=egypt+beach+vacation&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de%3aunofficial&amp;tbm=isch&amp;um=1 ) ? 
  that is because the whole idea that ** all ** western women wear headscarves in egypt is utter bullcrap . 
  just like the idea that all egyptian women would to that . 
  that applies to almost all muslim countries . 
  also the headscarve is a trend that came back . 
  you would not have found a single women in kairo wearing one 40 years ago . 
  and part of the reason why extreme religion surged in the past 20 years is because of saudi arabia , which was shielded from a secular saddam hussein by operation desert storm . 
  yes , our influence is mostly responsible why islam is such a strong force now in a lot of countries . 
  but this goes a little far . 
  i think this sentence already does it :  why ca n't they take the same accommodating attitude about our culture ? 
  what exactly is our 's ? 
  this guy speaks for himself and his racist friends . 
  islam is now a part of europe and has been for more than 30 years thanks to a lot of immigrants . 
  our coulture includes muslims ignoring that is racist . 
  and who are `` they '' ?
