  why do n't the christians do something about [ kony ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%27s_resistance_army ) i could ask by the very same token . 
  how do you force someone to be free ? 
  being free means you can choose . 
  if you force someone to do something they are not free to choose . 
  compared to the us , for example . 
  or australia . 
  yes , europe has come a long way , but as soon as the crisis hit , racism reared it 's ugly head . 
  in a big way . 
  / r/europe is just a small mirror . 
  imagine all the old people that do n't have internet . 
   anybody who dare deviates from standard left-wing mantras and sacred cows is `` racist '' nope . 
  actually i believe in europe we have a solid racist majority . 
  the standard is racist . 
  anyone being racist always defends themselves as some kind of minority , though . 
  maybe because they attack a minority ? 
  but the usual line goes something like this : `` it has to be said , even though it goes against political correctness . '', 
  or `` no one is saying it , but everyone is thinking it '' . 
  guess what : everyone is saying it . 
   mosques have proliferated all over the far-flung corners of `` racist '' europe , but churches are burned in egypt , pakistan , bangladesh , indonesia , nigeria , etc. 
  muslims openly and freely proselytize among non-muslims in `` racist '' europe , but christians are prohibited from doing the same in the islamic realm . 
  muslims demonstrate and even riot in `` racist '' europe in order to expand their cultural space , while christians are regularly murdered in egypt , nigeria , pakistan and indonesia . 
  that is open racism . 
  you point to shit that is in no way connected . 
  you make individuals over here responsible for some mob in god-knows-where . 
  by the same token i could point to any number of racist incidents in europe that resulted in the death of muslims and say that european christians are all muslim killers . 
  are we ? 
  no we are n't . 
  we are just a little racist . 
  that is all . 
  btw . 
  most countries you list here are even more racist than us . 
  does that make us better ? 
  a little , yes . 
  does that make your racism good ? 
  i find the racist undertones of your comment as well as all the upvotes pretty scary . 
  then again , i just checked the subreddit . 
  yea , we are in europe . 
  still a racist continent . 
  while i find burqas and niqabs abhorrent , and i personally dislike headscarfs , i find a ban like the one in france questionable . 
  i also dislike tatoos . 
  should we ban them now ? 
  personal freedom ist important . 
  [ here is a particular funny video about the niqab ban . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zamx5yomjxg ) so france , you now want to ban asians freaked out about the flu ? 
  your move . 
   jos\u00e9 manuel garc\u00eda-margallo believes gibraltar should be spanish jos\u00e9 manuel garc\u00eda-margallo believes that a petty territorial dispute is a great distraction from the criminal behaviour of the current ruling party of spain over the last 20 odd years or so that the spanish public just stumbled over . 
  though i am sure that , given some time , cameron will have his own scandal he would love to distract from with some gibraltar tensions . 
  back in 1982 the argentinians gave thatcher her bigges boost in popularity ever . 
  there must be a reason why not . 
  germany has been very good in paying back debt and debt bonds dating back to the 30s and 40s . 
  therefore there must be more to the story . 
  either there is some kind of diplomatic or other agreement on the books from god knows when or romania has some other outstanding issues from around the same time they chose not to honor and therefore does n't want to press now . 
  maybe even territorial or so . 
  it gets ugly really fast when you try to turn the wheel of history backwards . 
  so finland is honest about questions regarding sexuality . 
  not funny, 
  if you take a good look at the current situation , you will see that the settlements , as they stand , prohibit the formation of a palestinian state in the west bank . 
  i raised this issue in / r/israel recently . 
  because i wanted to get a feel for the current situation of the `` peace talks '' . 
  the vibe i am getting is that we will most likely not see an independant palestinian state in the west bank within the next 100 years or so . 
  [ here is a link to it . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/israel/comments/10dy10/i_have_a_couple_questions_regarding_the_west_bank/ ) syria is becoming the next 80s libanon and egypt went back to a military dictatorship . 
  imho the situation in the middle east went through a reset to the 1980s , when saddam was still an ally of the us ( which iraq is arguably again , now ) . 
  turkey is also going back to the 1980s politcally . 
  finally !, 
  they postpones the trial for months on end and waited for a word from the russians on an exchange before the trial . 
  but they kept denying the spies existed . 
  i have no idea why they waited this long . 
   she totally meant that a christian should disobey the law mostly in a `` totalitarian state '' is n't that exactly what muslim terrorists are doing ? 
  disobeying and fighting the state ? 
   that said , i do believe on the national level ireland and the netherlands want this . 
  it brings a lot of business to their countries . 
  the companies actually selling the product are based in both of these countries so it creates jobs , but in doing so it robs them of the corporate income from said companies . 
  you can see how much it benefits them . 
  the irish economy is doing great . 
  just like cyprus . 
  not like the german economy , which is not based on tax evasion and is slumping right now . 
  the irish made the right choice in becoming a tax haven . 
  latvia is right in following their example . 
  i would not excuse the irish here . 
  did i do that ? 
  also not our tax laws . 
  after all , we seem to want it , do n't we ? 
  otherwise we would outlaw the double irish . 
  or clean up uk overseas territories . 
  or anything for that matter . 
  did you ever hear of the caymen islands ? 
  [ no direct taxation is imposed on residents and cayman islands companies . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cayman_islands#taxation ) no taxes . 
  so becoming a tax haven in addition to a money laundering place is a worthy goal ? 
  if you look at switzerland , i guess it is . 
  and it 's not like eu countries are against it . 
  the uk maintains overseas territories that are the most notrious drug/terror money laundering places of all . 
  and no taxes . 
  so please go on . 
  latvia , cyprus and the like . 
  we do n't care for a stable euro or transparent money flows or taxes . 
  we really do n't . 
  otherwise we would do something about it . 
  which we clearly are not .
