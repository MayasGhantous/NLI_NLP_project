  and for this reason tons of people get their panties in a bunch and feel `` threatened '' by those bad immigrants . 
  while wearing jeans as pants . 
  or sneakers . 
  or whatever . 
  it 's basically a joke . 
  tons of idiots . 
  but the idiocy does n't stop there . 
  in the name of `` european values '' they start to become racist ( or islamophobe ) , which is pretty ironic , because those `` european values '' they claim to defend actually exclude any type of such xenophobia . 
  so by claiming to `` defend '' from this perceived ( though pretty much non existent ) threat , they become , ideology wise , very close to the islamists , that also have a lot of obvious contradictions in their life style vs their teachings . 
  it was deleted . 
   because youre stupid ? 
  as i thought yep , you are clearly the person that writes stuff that deserves a lot of upvotes ( currently 12 for parent ) in this comment thread . 
   is this a provocative statement ? 
  sure as hell it is and i hope to provoke at least one person to think a little bit deeper about it . 
  so we are talking about nazis and bringing them back . 
  like golden dawn in greece , for example . 
  i was wondering , so i had to ask . 
    referring to all muslims as islamists and calling them `` savages '' is racist . 
   nobody did this . 
  people do this all the time here on / r/europe . 
  i guess you do n't read this much . 
   doing so would be retarded , but still not racist ( see above ) . 
  i think it does simplify the issue a lot . 
  trying to diversify between different xenophobic sentiments like racism and islamophobia does n't really lead to anything , imho , because they are , in effect , every similar . 
  so i tend to summarize them under `` racism '' . 
  i do n't want to accuse you of anything , but most of the time i find that people that drone on and on about the perceived differences in these xenophobic sentiments are racists as well , most of the time . 
  though this might not apply to you . 
  but i am pretty weary at this point . 
  i cleary have been in / r/europe for too long . 
   nationalistic socialism was that a slip up ? 
  because i think we tried that a couple decades ago and it did n't work out so well . 
  are you seriously suggesting this ? 
  racists rarely refer to race these days , because they know it is frowned upon . 
  so instead of calling them `` brown '' , `` colored '' or `` black '' , they call them muslim immigrants . 
  their attitude towards them is the same , though . 
  calling them `` barbaric '' or `` savage '' is certainly implying that they are in some way inferior . 
  for some reason i did not see your post . 
  but i wonder why people are always so confused with me throwing islamophobia and racism in the same group . 
  because it is mostly the same . 
  the comment i linked to was putting `` muslim '' and `` islamist '' in the same context . 
  and calling it barbaric . 
  islamism , just like extremist christians or buddhists are certainly a problem . 
  referring to all muslims as islamists and calling them `` savages '' is racist . 
  oh , i did n't know you were active in this way . 
  thank you . 
  this is the reason i am subscribed to / r/europe again . 
  i unsubscribed because of all the racism . 
  europe has a little different attitude towards `` free speech '' . 
  we are culturally set up a little different . 
  in the us free speech is a holy cow . 
  except for claims of defamation or copyright . 
  you muzzle people with lawyers in a courtroom just as well in the us than you can in europe . 
  but , legal realities aside , still we have a different attitude towards free speech in europe in that hate speech tends to also get censored by law , next to copyright infringement , certain types of pornography and personal defamation that are censored both in the us and in europe . 
  we are not so different , when it comes to censorship . 
  but we do censor more . 
  actually i was n't really writing about censorship , but rather about racism in general . 
  also in this thread , in my comment you commented on , i was simply pointing out that rabbitlion did n't seem to find racism in these words ( that i linked to ) `` primitive culture and barbaric religion '' and `` these savages '' ( refering to muslims in general ) . 
  rabbitlion dismissed those words as not being racist and me ( as well as others on / r/europe ) having a pathologic fear of perceived racism . 
    sure , but calling them `` savages '' , barbaric and whatnot . 
   dude they are . 
  and here you go again . 
  `` they '' . 
  please be more specific in calling out individuals that are shitty people . 
  criminals , looters and whatnot . 
  otherwise you appear racist . 
  you remember ? 
    nope . 
  i do n't think it is ok to riot . 
   i was n't meaning the rioters see ? 
  much , much better . 
  you just called * them * -- ** rioters ** . 
  because that is what they are . 
  rioters . 
  they might also be muslim . 
  or christian . 
  or whatever . 
  but when you call people out for being shitty , like the guy that went on the island to kill 50 youths , you do n't call him the christian guy that goes around murdering people . 
  you call him a murderous faggot . 
   i was meaning the people who express anger in threads like this one . 
  you have to allow for the fact that people are native swedes are going to be angry seeing a bunch of immigrants trying to attack their police forces and burning down neighbourhoods . 
  i do n't give much about the `` natives '' vs `` non-natives '' thingy . 
  too complicated . 
  because in ideology , the islamists , rioters and racists are actually closer to each other than to most of the people i would call friends that have `` european values '' . 
  just call them idiots . 
  either way you have to concede that most people here on reddit that spout racists shit are just armchair fascists . 
  they are not `` native swedes '' that are sad or angry about `` their country '' . 
  they are from portugal , bulgaria or england for that matter . 
  and they have nothing to do with that particular incident . 
  even if they are swedish chances are low they live in these parts . 
  so it 's not really `` their '' town anyways . 
   not all statements criticising those who are different than you are racist . 
  sure , but calling them `` savages '' , barbaric and whatnot . 
  or alluding those statements is racist . 
  and this does happen tons of times in this subreddit . 
  / r/europe is full of racists . 
  just like europe is . 
   in general , i think there are a lot of very serious social , cultural , religious , and racial beliefs in europe at play , some of them acceptable , some of them unpalatable but fair , and some of them unacceptable you mean like racism , or islamism ? 
  i do n't think it is easy to get the dickheads to understand anything . 
  labels or no labels . 
  and as i said in another comment .
