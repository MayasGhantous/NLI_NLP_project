  and the german media was very , very careful on kosovo . 
  it 's not `` widespread '' per se . 
  especially among the leftists that harbor strong anti american sentiment you will often find the `` i love american people but i hate american politics '' attitude , which is very common among the world , because american voters do n't travel . 
  the americans you see abroad are usually a completely different bunch . 
  it is a mix of all . 
  be assured , it is absolutely save for americans in germany . 
  though it depends if you are black or asian . 
  then i would caution you a little about casual racism . 
  you might get checked by police more often , when traveling in germany while being black . 
   the growing anti-us sentiment in germany is understandable . 
  while critizism of certain us policies ( like guantanamo bay , iraq war , etc ) is completely and utterly understandable , i was aiming for something else : xenophobia . 
  anti-us , which works like racism or anti-semitism or even islamphobia . 
  these sentiments are not based on anything the perceived target may or may not have done . 
  it is simple dislike `` just 'cause '' . 
  and since the us is such a large nation , you will find examples to justify your dislike . 
  just like you will find blacks to justify racism or muslims to justify islamphobia ( the 9/11 attackers would be a good start ) . 
  lots of germans are pro putin . 
  the media is not ( understandbly , since putin killed a couple journalists and reigned in the media after a fairly free media in the 90s ) pro putin . 
  leading to lots of negative comments in the online sections for newspapers , tv stations , radio stations and such under each article that dares to present putin in a negative light . 
  why they are pro putin i am not sure . 
  i think it has something to do with anti semitism . 
  a political sience major once explained to me that when anti semitism became unfashionable during the 60s and 70s ( when younger germans found out about the holocaust and what lead up to it ) , it did n't cease to exist . 
  it just changed targets . 
  remember : xenophobia is not about the target , but the source . 
  the target does n't really matter . 
  so when they stopped hating jews , we needed to hate someone else . 
  and since vietnam came along , the us was a perfect target . 
  from then on we had a strong anti-us sentiment . 
  putin is one of the few guys that `` stand up '' to the us . 
  so he is the hero . 
  i think this is a deeply emotional issue . 
  [ edit ] : the `` anti semitism = anti us = pro putin '' ist just another wild theory of mine . 
  the media in germany is completely flabbergasted by all of this pro putin sentiment and they formed their own wild ( and often easily disproveable ) theories why that is . 
  please feel free to disregard this theory . 
  i actually have no idea why people are pro putin . 
  while i am not really pro us and certainly not anti russia , i think putin is just another bloody dictator with dangerous ambitions that uses wars to further his own politcal control and distract from the shortcomings of his government . 
  this is what i tried to say in a way . 
  we do n't know if/how putin is crazy in the head . 
  assuming the worst may not always the best strategy imho . 
  because for now , he seems to act very , very smart . 
  he keeps on raising the trouble and therefore the price for calming it . 
  maybe is currently simply shooting for acceptance of his krim conquest as well as a credible guarentees that ukraine wo n't become a nato member , he may be on to something . 
  europe is already very tired with his shit . 
  they might be ready to just sign on the dotted line of whatever putin comes up with , just to get rid of him stinking up eastern ukraine . 
  i think the article can be condensed into this paragraph :  despite article 5 , many nato countries would be reluctant to respond lest they trigger a nuclear war . 
  `` putin knows that they know that if they come to the assistance of estonia , then putin can respond with a very limited nuclear strike and destroy for example two european capitals . 
  not london and not paris , of course . '' basically the article is saying that putin is thinking about an '' ! open war ! '', 
  with nato ( wtf !! ), 
  and that nato would have conventional superiority in a limited war . 
  so he would `` drop nukes on european capitals '' , killing millions !!, 
  and the war would stop and he would `` win '' . 
  i really do n't know what to say . 
  this sound completely nuts . 
  and a very , very dangerous calculation as well . 
  what is keeping nato from a game of `` tit for tat '' and killing a couple million russians as well as targeting all their nuclear arsenal as best as possible ? 
  or something else ? 
  this could very easily escalate into wwiii . 
  for europe , it would already be wwiii if they actually killed millions with nuclear bombs . 
  it used to be the opposite , the warsow pact used to be vastly surperior in conventional forces during the cold war and the only way to stop them was nuclear weapons , so the french , for example , had their medium range nuclear devices trained on the rhein area . 
  thx france . 
  if a regular russian soldier was in ukraine , that would mean direct military involvement , instead of ` just ' supplying equipment to seperatists . 
  i do n't know why , but we seem to have complete opposite interpretations of the same facts . 
  i would go as far as saying that military and corruption go hand in hand everywhere . 
  maybe not to such a degree as spain . 
  but , otoh , maybe even more so , but in different ways . 
  over here in germany we have huge military projects that frequently run way over budget . 
  our corruption might not be as evident ( 270 generals !!, 
  ) , but may involve more $ $ $ than spain , simply because we have a much bigger military budget than spain has . 
  and those mentioned projects . 
  this brings to mind the stereotypical situation of the bully taking their victims hand and beating them with it : `` why do you beat yourself ? '' . 
  if i wage war on another country and supply my proxy troops with weapons , the other country is certainly to blame for the havoc caused by those weapons . 
  [ there is a room in the german `` white house '' ( bundeskanzleramt / chancellor 's house ) , where all the cabinet meetings take place . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=kabinettssitzung&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=aq9lu7jhf8intabugocodq&amp;ved=0cdeqsaq&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=730 ) when you stand in front of the building , it is situated at the top left corner of the building . 
  from the inside of that room you can see [ that grand soviet memorial ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=sowjetisches+ehrenmal+tiergarten&amp;client=iceweasel-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:unofficial&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=wbblu9yeb8axtabt34gqda&amp;ved=0cc0qsaq&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=730 ) rather close up . 
  it is one of the more prominent views from that room . 
  and it certainly makes an impression . 
  even if you are looking at it from the back side . 
  the bundestag ( parliament building ) is much further off . 
  the russians do n't want nato on their doorstep . 
  period . 
  if finland were to actually consider nato membership seriously , it ** would ** make them angry . 
  trust me . 
  how far would they go ? 
  difficult to say . 
  but why try them ? 
  relax , i am not going to deny the holocaust or the massive loss of life resulting in the german attack on the soviet union in the 40s . 
  and i do n't have a problem with anyone . 
  i very much suspect that the overwhelming majority of ethnic russians in ukraine feel the same way . 
  it might have been a little different in crimea , but i feel that the referendum there would have been much , much closer if it had n't been rigged . 
   a rather ridiculous fear for russia russia just invaded another country , because of the remote possibility that it could join the eu and associate with nato . 
  finland fought a rather bloody war with russia not so long ago in which russia was the aggressor . 
  for which they never appoligized in any way , because the whole period became their `` holy mother of all wars we are glorious in defeating fascism and saving the world '' celebration thingy that they keep digging up at every possible ( or improper ) moment like the jews dig up the holocaust . 
  russia has a military that would n't even need to move much stuff around from other places to crush finland 's defense . 
  they also have nuclear bombs that would deter anyone with more military from coming to finland 's aid . 
  i would ** not ** call finnish fears of russia ridiculous in any way . 
  i think the neutrality stance is pretty smart . 
  i would n't want to piss of russia either , if i had such a long border with them . 
  they are ( as they have proven in the last couple years ) still very much the imperialistic empire that they have been throughout the last couple centuries . 
   that sounds as if you 're saying germans have a secret need for a f\u00fchrer . 
  nope .
