  b ) the financial sector bancrupted europe . 
  with those billions upon billions of euros we could all enjoy a much higher gdp and greece would n't suffer . 
  yet it does n't even count as a crime , even though a ** lot ** of fraud was obviously involved . 
  those are just two examples . 
  these three points are just obvious errors in data collection off the top of my head . 
  in statistics you say : `` garbage in - garbage out '' if your data collection is biased , you wo n't get anything meaningful . 
  the problem with statistics in general is that it is the only way we can observe social realities in a objective manner . 
  personal observation is meaningless . 
  everything except statistics is subjective . 
  therefore we put a lot of trust in statistics , even though they are often flawed ( see above ) , when everything else about them seems to look fine . 
  but another big problem lies in the everything else . 
  statistics is a complicated field . 
  lot of errors are made during the calculation . 
  for example by applying the wrong methods . 
  because you have to look at context . 
  example : if you only look at average income levels and you have a lot of inequality , you might be watching a small percentage of the populance getting rich , while everyone else gets poorer . 
  publishing the median income alongside would help alleviate the problem . 
  in the end statistics get interpreted . 
  often by journalists . 
  and suddenly we subjectivity introduced again . 
  journalists have opinions . 
  even if you publish the statistics themselves , you will often have to summarize things . 
  and even if you do n't summarize , the very own bias of the person reading the statistics will subjectivy the results . 
  scientists recently complained that journalists will try to make clickbait out of scientific results , trying to find something sensational and blowing that up , even if the actual scientific findings do n't justify or even ** contradict ** what the journalist thinks they found . 
  which is almost intentional misunderstanding of science . 
  not counting unintentional errors in science reporting . 
   a part of it can not be accounted for even by those confounding variables currently , given the problems described above , there is no evidence for this . 
  in the end though , sorry for the long wait , this does n't even matter . 
  let 's pretend for a second that , * yes * , there is more crime from certain nationalities if you correct for other variables . 
  what should we do about it ? 
  is there an ethical way to deal with this ? 
  in the end , it is just an arbitrary feature . 
  if we group crime by month of birth and find a slightly higher number of your month , would it be fair if you paid a higher tax rate to balance the cost of crime that people from your birth month cause ? 
  any disadvantage an individual must endure because he or she is put in a group and suffers consequences for actions other members of that group cause is not just . 
  therefore it is illegal in lawful countries . 
  any constitution of a modern society strictly prohibits prejudices you describe . 
   that is the kind of thing i want to have debates this debate would be meaningless , as i have shown above . 
  if not unconstitutional . 
  furthermore , those `` debates '' only attract certain people . 
  either people who do n't have a clue , or right wing extremists , who want to abolish the constitution . 
   excusing many immigrant groups ' high crime rates over here in europe , we take great pride in our values that judge an individual on their own merits , instead of collectively punishing them after putting them in groups for arbitrary features , such as `` muslims '' , no matter where they come from . 
  or nationality , no matter who they are . 
   crippled people ... 
   even if it 's totally immoral  how to appease anti-immigration people [ this must be intentional . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeasement ) but it is so good , that i only caught it on the second read . 
  i like it . 
  actually we are all prejudiced . 
  it is part of being human . 
  as long as we are aware of these things ( and try not to let it influence our words and actions too much ) , we can live with this , i suppose . 
  what choice do we have ? 
  i was mostly making fun of the bbc headline . 
  and of / r/europe 's persistant islamophobia . 
  it 's not terrorism , if it ain ' muslims . 
  thank you / u/blackjacksandhookers for using the sub headline without the offending word . 
  at least the bbc had the decency to put ` terror ' in quotation marks . 
  only real muslims get the * real * terrorism label without quotation marks . 
  who are we ? 
  are we suddenly unprejudiced ? 
  we are / r/europe !, 
   neurosurgeons are rarely idiots . 
  especially when compared to random christians trying to enshrine religion from criticism on a forum . 
  [ nobel prize winners are also rarely idiots . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566699/james-watson-suspended-over-racism-claims.html ) but what do you want to say anyways ? 
  a neurosurgeon ca n't be wrong ? 
  a neurosurgeon ca n't be racist ? 
  why do i need to compare ? 
  in what ? 
  this does n't make sense at all . 
  lots of people are wrong all the time . 
  no matter what their job is . 
  did you read the rationalwiki page on him ? 
  they qualified him as an idiot . 
  not me . 
  and you are really defending [ this ? 
  ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/sam_harris#let.27s_play_.22harris_or_malkin.3f.22 ) * `` we should profile muslims , or anyone who looks like he or she could conceivably be muslim , and we should be honest about it . 
  '' *  seriously , you 're a racist , because i `` conflate race and religion '' ? 
  that is not racist , remember ? 
  maybe you are confused . 
  i am not sam harris . 
   a moron oh , the insults again ? 
  because you are not angry ? 
  not provoked ? 
  we ** just ** had this . 
   likely homophobic you are basing this on what ? 
  oh , i forgot . 
  you are basing your statemtent on nothing . 
  you are just thowing asinine statements out there . 
  for no reason whatsoever . 
   and as dishonest as you can be yea , because i lie about being enraged all the time throwing insults at you . 
  that is totally dishonest . 
  you are right . 
   you judged ayaan hirsi ali to be a muslim ?? 
  i wrote she was born a muslim . 
  she obviously left the religion . 
  after she came to europe . 
  a chance islamophobes would n't like to give people like her . 
  remember ? 
   once again , i do n't insult you , i merely use appropriate qualifiers . 
  `` moron '' is quite appropriate . 
  moron is n't an insult ?
