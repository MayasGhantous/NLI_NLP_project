  it is an `` appropriate qualifier '' ? 
  and you are calling ** me ** out on my supposedly bad english ? 
  you should really look words up in a dictionary , before you use them . 
   ( as fundies tend to ) let 's look at `` fundies '' for a moment . 
  what makes them `` fundies '' ? 
  mostly their * closed * view of reality . 
  they see things in black and white . 
  good and evil . 
  they share this with islamophobes . 
  [ here is an explanation of the difference between critizism of islam and islamophobia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamophobia#contrasting_views_on_islam ) . 
  i have to point out though , that islamophobia means more than `` closed '' racist `` critizism '' of islam . 
  [ it has more than one single meaning . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqok9gj ) as i explained a lot of times before , it is often used to describe prejudice against muslims , as demonstrated by sam harris above . 
  in this dicussion i used that meaning almost exclusively . 
  it clearly says so in the wikipedia article , but since you do n't seem to read much , even if linked repeadetly by me or even yourself , i thought i would point that out again . 
  in that sense , islamophobes and fundamentalist muslims ( or christians or whatever , `` fundies '' as you call them ) are similar in how they view the world . 
  and different from non racist people . 
   the well-poisoning is new what is that supposed to mean ? 
  you mentioned sam harris and bill maher many times as people who , in your opinion , are `` right about islam '' and i am supposedly wrong ( well , i checked up on them and they are idiots , according to rationalwiki ) and [ told me to use rationalwiki instead of wikipedia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq4msub ) . 
  well , i used rationalwiki . 
  what score did you [ achieve playing `` harris or malkin ? 
  '' ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/sam_harris#let.27s_play_.22harris_or_malkin.3f.22 ) either you do n't read your own sources , which is highly likely , because you did n't like it , when i quoted both of them ( the ali video and the wikipedia article ) , or you seem to forget things that do n't fit your racism right after you read them . 
  which is why i tried in vain to get you to reread this discussion thread so many times . 
  because you never respond to anything that disputes your racism . 
   maher can be horribly wrong on one subject ( vaccines ) and absolutely right on another ( religion ) , or he can be an idiot on both accounts . 
   same for anyone else you want to dismiss . 
  remember ? 
  you are the one [ dismissing wikipedia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq4msub ) and your sources if they do n't say what you like ( `` people are born into islam '' religion as an `` accident of birth '' as you called it ) . 
   i did not get angry , either . 
  if you did n't try [ to insult me so many times ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqxcbuo ) because you were angry , why did you do it then ? 
  maybe because you [ get off insulting whoever you are debating ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpjrtlc ) ? 
  why would you think i want to provoke you ? 
  what is it that i wrote that makes you think that ? 
  did i call you a [ fucking idiot ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp7dnnt ) ? 
  or a [ theocrat-wannabe ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpa63ln ) , whatever that is supposed to mean ? 
  i did n't try to insult you by calling you a [ bigot ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cphmiq4 ) . 
  or a [ complete simpleton ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpivuj9 ) . 
  if i wanted to provoke you , i would write that [ you 're way dumber than i suspected . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpn4b4x ) ( btw . 
  if i deny the existence of homophobia , and try to put hate on lgbt ` agenda ' in any way possible , do i advocate for mistreating anyone ? 
  would that be an [ argument in good faith ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq47xui ) ) i would probabely call [ you a massive idiot who thinks her misconceptions are wisdom ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq4lohg ) , if i wanted to enrage you , though maybe [ only in my head ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqolei0 ) . 
  and then you would be so enraged , you would probabely stop arguing and start trying to insult me by calling me a [ simpleton ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq5d4h9 ) and [ obtuse . 
  that i spread nonsense ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq5h32o ) . 
  and you would [ repeat ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq5rb31 ) that [ over ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq5jywa ) and [ over ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq5u9ps ) , because you would be blind with rage . 
  you would also call me a [ fantastic imbecile , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq8xm62 ) adding that i have [ low cognitive ability ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq9oecr ) . 
  but luckily , you [ do n't get angry ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqhfsx6 ) and would not call me [ an idiot ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqhoj3p ) . 
  or ask me if i [ can read ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqnp0rj ) . 
  and you would never dare call me [ holocaust denier ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqo67wd ) , just because you were trying to provoke me are felt provoked yourself . 
  or call me a [ moron ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqoha5w ) . 
  or [ an idiot ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqok9gj ) . 
  good to know this all [ never happened ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqp8r3x ) . 
  you were always [ very nice and never argued in bad faith . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqradjq ) . 
  you are right . 
  you are not easily provoked . 
  which is why you would never call me racist , just because you think i [ conflate race and religion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpmbr7r ) , which is n't anywhere near the definition of racism . 
  as we have clearly seen , you are not provoked when someone calls you a [ racist , because of your persistent islamophobic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamophobia#racism ) stance . 
  and it does n't get to you at all , when you are called an anti-semite , because you do n't want to aknowledge any of it 's [ manifestations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism#manifestations ) except for one . 
  you are very relaxed . 
  getting back to your favourite [ quote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cq57eds ) , which most of this discussion was about , i read up rationalwiki about the listed supporters and i think i found a lot of background to it . 
  did you ever play [ `` harris or malkin ? 
  '' ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/sam_harris#let.27s_play_.22harris_or_malkin.3f.22 ) or acutally looked up who [ bill maher ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/bill_maher ) is , at least according to rationalwiki ? 
  reading those entries i gained a lot of insight into what i guess must be your ideology . 
  and i drew back in disgust . 
  [ edit  i am also very sad that you did not even understand a single thing about racism . 
  that racism is about the racist . 
  not about the target . 
  you kept pointing at the target of racism and that it needs to have something ( genetic or hereditary , i think ? ), 
  for the racism to exist . 
  in that way you are following the racist point of view . 
  their reasoning . 
  but racism would n't exist without the racist . 
  you need to look at them if you want to explain racism . 
  so it does n't matter if someone is racist about a culture or anything else . 
  yet you could n't even make that conclusion . 
  even if it had nothing to do with islam at all . 
   i 'm not * that * easily provoked [ provocation is the other thing this discussion was about in the beginning . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp7cgbe ) i already [ shared my views ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpxog4l ) on that issue a couple times . 
  and i [ discussed why provocation might not be the best way to educate someone , because they wont listen to you . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cplgt1s ) as was proven in this very discussion , in which you did n't even want to understand that racism is about the racist , not the subject . 
  which is a basic point that has nothing to do with islam at all . 
   you 're not even trying anymore , are you ? 
  you are the one that did n't even want to answer a single simple question . 
  you were reluctant to call even merah an anti-semite . 
  because you did n't even want to say the word . 
  and then you deflect from that again by feigning outrage at a quote from your source . 
  imagine for a second you are argueing about someone that went into an lgbt help center and committed a massacre . 
  and the person you are discussion this with does not even want to call the perpetrator homophobic . 
  and is deflecting all the time . 
  i would say this person has a problem with their own homophobia . 
   either you 're projecting or you 're the worst troll i 've ever encountered . 
  you are doing something ( intellectual dishonesty , lying , trolling ) and then , one or two posts later , you accuse me of the same . 
  i guess this is intentional and you are the one trolling . 
   petty criminal ??? 
  i quoted from the article you linked to . 
  you know that . 
  this is intentional by you . 
  you are playing dumb . 
  you are intentionally not answering a single question . 
  again .
