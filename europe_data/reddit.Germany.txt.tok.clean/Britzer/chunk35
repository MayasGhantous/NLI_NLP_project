  not everyone has or wants that . 
  you also need certain industries that can clearly benefit from this . 
  i guess many smaller nations may lack a solid combination of both . 
  and countries with `` nationalized '' industry would have an easier time on both ends . 
  maybe the defense industry would be a good candidate , because they already have an intimate relationship with the state and they need to be able to keep secrets . 
  which would make the unsc p5 prime suspects ( the unsc permanent five are the first five countries that had the bomb and are the largest arms exporters ) . 
  which includes france and the uk . 
  that being said , i always need to include my ( somewhat ot ) rant about the intelligence community : this is n't the scandal . 
  none of that is . 
  ok , it is a little strange to have a national spy agency do industrial espionage against their national companies , but whatever . 
  industrial secrets are known targets for espionage . 
  always have been . 
  just as politicians . 
  the real revelation of snowden is the spying on everyone . 
  making everyone a target . 
  which is new in human history . 
  we could n't do that before , because we lacked the technological means . 
  that is n't just a few billion dollars worth of industrial secrets lost . 
  this is new and very scary . 
  they will have dirt on politicians on any level . 
  before anyone has even risen up . 
  they can spread dirt on people posting in public forums with opinions they do n't like . 
  maybe they have already prepared bots ? 
  bottom line : everyone is a target . 
  that is the real scandal . 
  and the media and everyone else still get this wrong . 
  every time . 
  which is why i rant . 
    is this trolling or are you really not aware of this ? 
   if you 're going to troll , troll better . 
  preschool again ? 
  * `` you did '' * - * `` no , you did '' * i guess we completed another cycle . 
   i 'm actually pre-answering your rants , now . 
  that 's how dull you 've become . 
  you know what it means , when i write `` please read the comments again '' , right ? 
  which i have been doing for more than three weeks now , have n't i ? 
  is this trolling or are you really not aware of this ? 
  i think the main reason you are so mad is because you know i am right and you feel caught . 
  you have to understand that deals on military hardware with the gulf monarchies ( kuwait , qatar , bahrain , saudi arabia , uae ) are not about the hardware itself , but rather `` security assurances '' . 
  we ( eu , usa ) maintain an undeclared defense alliance with them . 
  basically , we insure their mideval ( isis / taliban like ) kingdoms will withstand the tide of history and in turn they buy billion dollars worth of equipment , which they can hardly make proper use of . 
  which does n't matter . 
  one rather unexpected consequence is their export of radical islam and support of the resulting terrorist groups . 
  which started somewhere in the 80s . 
  but we have a good answer to that : islamophobia . 
  basically it goes like this : we put/keep corrupt puppets in power , they give us oil and buy shit from us , they finance other shitloards and export brainwashing and we blame our muslims for that . 
  i would say this works rather well . 
  have you checked the gas price lately ? 
  pretty low . 
  edit : maybe it is qatar 's way of saying `` sorry for charlie hebdo '' ? 
  i do n't trust the us propaganda any more than i trust kiew or moscow . 
  that being said , the special forces were on camera , without identification , while taking over crimea . 
  in a clear violation not only of international law , but also of the budapest memorandum on security assurances . 
  officially moscow maintained that those were not russian troops . 
  lying about an invasion . 
  which is why everyone that can count to two will strongly suspect that moscow is behind the `` uprising '' in eastern ukraine . 
  is it really much of a difference if moscow is only financing and supplying `` seperatists '' with arms , lend soldiers , or do command and control ? 
  the change of terms is meaningless . 
  much more worrisome , and much easier to verify is troop movement . 
  if moscow is concentrating troops at the border between ukraine and russia without official announcements , it looks fishy . 
  true to propaganda , they should have at least announced it to be a `` defensive '' move against suspected nato involvement in the conflict . 
  or did they announce anything ? 
   everything i 'd read that points out just how irrelevant race is to iq can you source that ? 
  afaik , that is quite a complicated issue . 
  so i would love to read your sources on that . 
  about your other points i had a very tiring discussion very recently . 
  i would love to hear your opinion on that . 
  [ my original post . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp7cgbe ) [ discussion starts here and branches off a couple times . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp7dnnt ) it goes on forever . 
  you have to click on `` continue this thread '' for at least five times . 
  * i would really like to read your opinion on this thread . 
  * btw . 
  my original point in that thread is that you should try not offending people if you want to have a discussion . 
  no matter how wrong you think they are or they facutally are . 
  facts like evolution are not up for debate . 
  but that does n't mean everyone agrees . 
  in this day and age sometimes people tend to forget that there are certainly many facts that many people simply get wrong . 
  not every opinion is valid . 
  but that does n't mean that you will get far discussing asinine opinions by insulting the person holding these opinions . 
  by being somewhat offensive both to you and / u/arvinadystopia i was discussing this with , i obviously was n't very smart , if i wanted to change either of your opinions and convince you that you are wrong . 
  truth and facts may be on my side . 
  but those obviously are of no help whatsoever . 
  see my point above about everyone being irrational at some point about something . 
   those points certainly describe my belief with the exception of 6 & 8 those points are to identify a `` closed view '' of islam . 
  in accordance with islamophobia . 
  in order to differentiate critizism from hate . 
  by `` agreeing '' with the points , you identify yourself as islamophobic . 
  just replace `` islam '' with anything you like . 
  it is arbritrary . 
  the hate stays the same . 
  be it judaism , black skin , romani , ...  why would i want to let in a religion so presently tied to violence it 's not . 
  not even close : http://necrometrics.com/ you are making a connection that is n't there : http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html  why should i respect someones irrational belief ? 
  many people are irrational . 
  probabely all are in some way . 
  the amount of freaks you get in internet forums that believe all kinds of shit ( 9/11 conspiracy , libertarians , communists , nationalists , ... ) is unsettleling . 
  i do n't respect any of their views . 
  but i would n't dream of hating them as people , or trying to limit their freedom of movement . 
   it 's also frustrating when someone gives up on a debate & just cries racist -_- i have debated enough racists this year . 
  the core of racism is the hate .
