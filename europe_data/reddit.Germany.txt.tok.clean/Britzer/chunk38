  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp8kuwn ) also :  how loud right-wingers shout nonsense like `` islamophobia '' belgium seems strange . 
  in germany all right-wingers are islamophobes and , like you , deny it . 
  you know , the same kind of people that hate lgbt hate muslims . 
  usually . 
  at least over here . 
  another good one :  [ islamophobia is a meaningless word . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp95h7d ) another good one :  [ antisemitism is n't about religion , idiot . 
  an atheist jew would be a target of it , whereas a non-ethnically-jewish jew would n't . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpa65qw ) all ( and there is so much more ) easily refutable bullshit . 
  which applies to everything you wrote . 
  so much for a `` skewed '' view of reality . 
  but instead of racism against muslims , you wanted to talk about `` critizism of religion '' . 
  which is n't the same thing as wanting muslims to stay out of europe . 
  but i also explained that . 
  at lenght . 
  another gem of yours :  [ so , even if someone hated all muslims , that person would n't be analoguous to a racist ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpci3sw ) obviously total bullshit . 
  can only come from a racist . 
  just choose another arbitrary feature . 
  how about practising lgbt ? 
  as long as someone is gay and is n't having a relationship with the same sex , they are fine . 
  going by your logic , obviously hating everyone that `` acts lgbt '' , for example by wearing the clothes of the opposite sex , that would n't be analoguoues to a racist . 
  because you would hate people for their acts , not for their genetics . 
  ** that ** is your reality . 
  obviously you do n't hate lgbt . 
  you only hate muslims . 
  such an obvious flaw in logic and your denial ( to yourself and to others ) are features of this . 
  like you said yourself : many people that are racist do n't think of themselves in such a way . 
  another staple of almost all your comments . 
  the baseless accusations , that , ironically , are aptly reactions to your very own comments . 
   what you think happened and what happened are very different things . 
  it 's all there . 
  you can read if you like . 
  you know , finally actually read what i wrote for a change ? 
  again , these are distinct issues you are mixing up . 
  the one i was addressing is islamophobia as the discrimination of muslims . 
  another aspect of islamophobia , which you seem to be mixing this up with , is the critizism of islam . 
  there is certainly valid critizism of islam , just as there is valid critizism of israel and jews . 
  though most of it is anti-semitism and islamophobia . 
  as described in the [ wikipedia article on islamophobia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamophobia#contrasting_views_on_islam ) , which explains how to identify islamophobia trying to disguise itself as critizism of islam . 
  i think you hit at least three of these during this discussion . 
  but this is n't a new argument in this discussion , since i have linked to this wikipedia article before . 
  i also discussed the issue of critizism of islam at length before . 
  even different aspects and implementations of these . 
  after all , this was my first point in this thread , before you even joined the discussion . 
  more than once i explained these points to you at length and in detail . 
  but instead of putting forth arguments , you simply ignored everything i wrote and repeated your points that i had already confuted . 
  like the existence of anti-semitism against jews as a religious group or the existence of antiziganism as a xenophobia against a culture . 
  or the nature of religion as a collection of scriptures ** as well as ** a clergy , rituals , places of worship and a number of followers , which are all part of said religion . 
  simply ignoring the arguments and almost everything i wrote and presented and repeating your already disproven points is very immature . 
  an issue which i also discussed at length more than once . 
  i addressed all your points , brought all the arguments , which you ignored and even linked back to them a couple times to no avail . 
  all the while you accuse me of all the things you represent . 
  as in being stubborn , intellectually dishonest and daft . 
   it is n't worth going to school as they 'll get discriminated against , and this exchange proved the opposite ? 
   you 're not the first idiot to want religion to be free from criticism it is quite annoying that i have to do this sooooooo many times : read my comments . 
  i critizised religion amply during our discussion . 
  many times . 
  if i wanted religion to be free from criticism , why would i critizise it myself ? 
  these kind of arguments only make sense to someone who is in deep denial about their own position . 
  do i need to write it down again ? 
    it does n't matter if you want to kill all muslims , or merely do n't want them as neighbors or do n't want them to immigrate to europe . 
   and , i never argued any of that . 
  so you do n't discriminate , [ but merely deny that discrimination exists and mock people that mention it , right ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp8kuwn ) big fucking difference . 
  what were you droning on about `` intellectual dishonesty '' a while back ? 
   perhaps because gypsy kids spend more time begging for money and pickpocketing on the streets than at school ? 
  that is the clarification i was looking for . 
   they are probably so used to dealing with romanian gypsies that dispatched the same interpreters to normal romanians who normally do n't need interpreters because they attended school and speak at least some english . 
  so you are saying that romani do n't go to school as opposed to romanians who do ? 
  why do you think that is the case ? 
  the article says that they needed romanian interpreters to talk to the romanians . 
  so why do you think romanians speak better english than romani ? 
   you do n't even fucking read . 
  well , at least i took the time to read the [ nazi 's definition of a jew . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/who_is_a_jew%3f#nazism ) if your grandparents were jews , you were . 
  and they thought this constituted race . 
  but the grandparents could have converted . 
  in fact , you are born a jew , if your mother is a jew . 
  who could convert to judaism . 
  but why is the nazi 's definition of judaism relevant today ? 
  when i wrote about the horros of nazism and communism in the last century , the latter being declared atheists and committing atrocities against religious groups , you were n't interested . 
  anti-semitims and islamophobia as i described it in today 's world are about features people recognize . 
  like the turban for muslims , even though it is n't ( charlie hebdo , anyone ? ) . 
  or the kippah for jews . 
  or the origin of people . 
  if you are from islamic countries , europeans object to your immigration , as opposed to asian countries , even though indonesia is the most populous islamic nation . 
  btw . 
  there is a muslim matriarchal society in indonesia . 
  islam adepts and takes on local customs and culture . 
  just like christianity . 
  fgm , for example , existed before islam and generally is n't practiced outside specific communities . 
  same with anti-semitism . 
  or racism , as i explained often enough , though you obviously never read it . 
  people like you hate groups and their members for arbitrary reasons choosing arbitrary features to devise a group to hate . 
  it does n't matter if it is a cultural , religious or ethnic feature . 
  if you are born with it or aquire it later . 
  or because your mother converted to some religion . 
  it does n't matter if you want to kill all muslims , or merely do n't want them as neighbors or do n't want them to immigrate to europe . 
  it is discrimination . 
  and while you can discriminate against any group of people , discrimination against deprived minorities that suffer institutional racism , is especially vile .
