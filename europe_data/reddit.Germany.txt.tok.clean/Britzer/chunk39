  that is a problem we generally describe as racism . 
  and if many people subscribe to the same hate , we make a word for it . 
  like anti-semitism . 
  or islamophobia . 
  you calling it a `` made up word '' , when it is simply a description of a widespread phenomenon , which you also deny , makes you , clearly , a racist . 
  a hater . 
  is that sooooo difficult to understand . 
  is your denial soooo strong ? 
  nazis again ? 
  really ? 
  that is how this discussion ends ? 
  you can be racist and define anti-semitism yourself different from the dictionary all because ... `` nazis '' ? 
  if you would take a look at the dictionary , you would find that the jewish identity today is mostly defined by cultural heritage . 
  culture . 
  not race . 
  but since reality does n't fit your racist narrative , you do n't accept it . 
   are they ashkenazi , sephardic , ... ? 
  how would you recognize those on the steet ? 
  what are their characteristics ? 
  remember : we were talking about anti-semitism . 
  like arson attacks on synogogues . 
  or attacks on people wearing a kippa . 
  or people being upset about alleged jewish media dominance . 
  or what do you think are manifastations of anti-semitism ? 
  you wanted to define jews as victims of anti-semitism . 
  and your point is that anti-semitism is about jewish ethnicity . 
  i always thought in order to discriminate against people , you have to be able to identify them . 
   you 're basically an holocaust denier really ? 
   there are jews ( ethnicity ) how do you define a jewish ethnicity ? 
  how do they look like ? 
  how do their looks differ from other ethnicities ( african american , asian , caucasian , indian , etc. 
  [ you defined anti-semitsm as racism . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpa65qw ) you made the jewish religion into a race . 
  oh look : [ here you even used the crocked nose stereotype to describe racism . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpbuj4t ) did you ever see a charlie hebdo cartoon of a muslims * without * a crocked nose ? 
  but if they do it , it is n't racism , right ? 
   you are deeply ignorant of the magazine you criticise . 
  do they have cartoons of muslims * without * a turban ? 
  just wondering . 
  btw . 
  if crocked nose jews is racist , because jews are a race and not a religion , crocked nose muslims ( in charlie hebdo ) is what ? 
  i am confused . 
  every single point here is asinine again . 
  unfortunately . 
  but since i have learned that you do n't accept even basic facts and sources such as dictionaries , i am not going to even start trying to refute all your bullshit . 
  except this gem :  i do not appreciate a moron trying to portray everyone who does n't share his racial view of religions as racists i explained at length ( we had this before , did n't we ) what is behind hate and racism and the similarities . 
  i never wrote anything about a `` racial view of religions '' . 
  i pointed out that racists frequently consider all people wearing a turban as muslim ( charlie hebdo , for example ) and , similarily depict mulims as having brown skin . 
  the brown skin is interchangeable with islam to them . 
  not to me . 
  i made this perfectly clear . 
  to modern racism , islam is code for brown people . 
  the whole point is : you made several posts in which ** you shared your racial view of religion ** . 
  when i tried to point out that anti-semitism is about religion , you tried to make it about something people are born with . 
  a form of racism . 
  as if there was a jewish race . 
  did n't you also try to make anti-semitism about semites ? 
  i do n't clearly remember . 
  that would be very racist in itself , but i disgress . 
  needless to say , this kind of `` projecting '' happened numerous times throughout this discussion . 
  you , again , clearly win this discussion . 
  there is not a single fact in the world you could n't ignore or bent to your will to win this . 
  i do n't stand a chance . 
   yes , you do n't understand something you are doing it again . 
  `` something '' the ominous word . 
  i am doing `` something '' or i am not doing `` something '' , i do n't understand `` something '' . 
  but for almost all of your posts , you never explain what `` something '' is . 
  what is really sad about all of this : you did this throughout the whole discussion . 
  i explained how and why what you wrote is asinine . 
  but just one or two posts late , you come up with the same thing . 
  which is why i wrote so many comments trying to get you to start reading/comprehending the discussion . 
  and this time , you have outdone youself . 
  even though i just told you that this is exactly the problem . 
  there is no discussion . 
  i explained something to you , and you made some asinine points . 
  which i immediatly and soundly rebuked , repeadetly and including sources . 
  other than that . 
  nothing from you . 
  you are either very oblivious , very stupid , or very dishonest . 
  the last one would be pretty bad , because you kept accusing me of the very same thing . 
   but do n't start projecting dishonsty ? 
   your racism my racism ? 
  i told you , that this is n't kindergarten . 
  it 's not `` you are '' - `` no you are '' . 
  you provided ample proof of your racism . 
  there is nothing racist in anything i wrote . 
  and you never even attempted to ( see above ) provide any substance to that claim . 
  well , you hardly provided any substance at all . 
  just baseless accusations . 
  which explains your islamophobia . 
  baseless racism against muslims . 
  you do n't reason . 
  you do n't think . 
  you simply state shit . 
  also , why do you always come up with these crazy one liners :  history is n't a science no explanation . 
  nothing . 
  just some stupid shit you picked up from a clickbait article on the net that probabely went through your facebook timeline , because you are following other idiots . 
  yes there is a discussion about what is science and what is n't . 
  if you truely follow it , nothing , except maybe philosophy and possibly mathematics will remain . 
  but trying that rebuke , when you just tried to argue that you know more about ancient history than established historical science on the subject is - ... is - well , i give up .
