  you win . 
  you truely do . 
  you really do n't get it , do you ? 
  well , let me humor you one last time . 
  science is usually what we use to know things . 
  we know about history from historical scientists . 
  all we know about the ancient greeks and the ancient romans comes from scientists . 
  unless you use other sources . 
  a lot of people in the us claim that evolution did not happen , because the bible is a more authoritative source . 
  and according to * their * interpretation of the bible ( interpretations of the bible are always debatable , german theological science holds a radically different view compared to evangelist laymen from the us , for example ) evolution is contrary to what is in the bible and therefore did n't happen . 
  this is exemplary for our discussion , because everytime i come with facts and sources , you attack the sources . 
  for example wikipedia . 
  or even science , in this case . 
  the one time you linked to a source , it directly contradicted what you said and supported my points . 
  ali said she was born into islam . 
  and when you stated a reason for your racist opinions , i simply pointed to facts that contradict these . 
  so you stopped writing reasons alltogether . 
  first you wrote that i am wrong , because this and that . 
  and when i showed that this and that is hogwash , you stopped that and simply wrote that i was wrong . 
  not why . 
  not even where i was wrong . 
  and that i was dishonest . 
  you probabely did n't even realized what you are doing . 
  racists are pretty good at self denial . 
  just like the user i linked to . 
  tried to redefine anti semitism to be about semites . 
  a year ago i has someone write that jews need to die . 
  i called him an anti-semite . 
  his answer was the same : anti-semitism is about semites . 
  so he ca n't be an anti-semite if he hates jews . 
  redefining anti-semitism as being about semites is a pretty clear sign someone is racist . 
  but in order to justify hate like islamophobia and racism , you need to cut some corners . 
  it does n't work , if you stay neutral and apply logic . 
  yea . 
  i am totally wrong . 
  anti-semitism is about semites . 
  just like xenophobia is all about xenon lights . 
  why ? 
  because a xenophobia ** must ** be about genetics and race . 
  therefore anti-semitism ca n't be about religion . 
  you two are a perfect fit . 
  it was just getting entertaining . 
  do n't you want to go to the races again ? 
  you know ? 
  because you are a racist ? 
  with xenon light ? 
  because you are a xenophobe ? 
  because it is greek , as you cared to explain ? 
  i was wondering why you did n't provide a wikipedia link to screaming , after i mentioned yellow . 
  after all , you really wanted to talk about semites , after i mentioned anti-semitism . 
  hahahaha also : did you know that romani are not discriminated again , once they settle down and are not traveling anymore ? 
  traveling is a trait people are born with . 
  just like i explained in my other thread . 
  and you can not become a jew , because judaism is only inhereted through genes . 
  because hate is only xenophobic , if someone is born with the travel-gene or the jew-gene . 
  amiright ? 
  i am sure you have totally good retorts to those arguments . 
  i wan na be entertained . 
  dance , little monkey , dance !, 
  all racists are unbelievably stupid . 
  are they born stupid ? 
  do you have the racist gene ? 
  do you have the dumb gene ? 
  [ loop that shit again , for extra idiot mode . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/330da4/argentina_has_begun_legal_proceedings_against/cqhh4ki ) dude , there is a reason why i linked to `` yellow '' . 
  if i was making a comment about yellow , you would ask me not to scream ( `` yell '' `` ow '' ) ow at you . 
  now if someone would be that daft , would you feel the need to include a link to wikipedia ? 
  it is a fucking color . 
  i explained it to you . 
  and now you say i have no argument . 
  even though i had ** and ** i linked to it later on . 
  i am anxious . 
  how much stupider can this get ? 
  what is next ? 
  because you are proving dumber beyond my imagination . 
  you have got me on the edge of my seat . 
  come on . 
  say something stupid . 
  :-) this has become rather more entertaining than i thought . 
  you are making up the meaning of words . 
  not me . 
  [ why would i need to link to the definitions of simple words ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yellow ) discussing anything on this level simply does n't make sense . 
  for over three posts ( too lazy to count ) , you did n't even grasp what we were talking about . 
  even though i wrote it right at the beginning . 
  you do n't know the meaning of words . 
  i tell you that much . 
  you do n't understand what 2 means . 
  in order to have any kind of discussion , i would need at least three posts to have you understand basic words about what we talk about . 
  your comprehension level seems to be below 12 year old kids . 
  again : wtf ? 
  i am still stunned . 
  dude !, 
  stop !, 
  if you do n't even know the basic definition of anti-semitism and refuse to look it up , and discussion with you is pointless . 
  anything we could discuss , like your racism , your islamophobia , xenophobia , etc. 
  are words that have meanings that obviously go beyond your comprehension . 
  because you do n't even want to know something . 
  you live in your own world . 
  you are utterly insane .
