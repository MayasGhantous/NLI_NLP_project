  you have no idea what ad hominem or the dunning-kruger effect even mean . 
  you simply reiterate dumb talking points you picked up somewhere in your stormfront forums you frequent . 
  this is totally pointless . 
  yes you are a fucking idiot . 
  anti-semitism , as a word used today , has nothing to do with semites . 
  the fact that you obviously have n't , as of yet , not even read a single encyclopedic article on the definition of anti-semitsm , for example in wikipedia , shows that you are not only a fucking idiot for not knowing simple words , but also a stubborn trollish idiot for not looking something up when told to do . 
  you must be a troll . 
  otherwise this does n't make sense . 
  at all . 
  stupid is one thing . 
  stupid as you try to make yourself look like is a whole different level of stupid . 
  insanely stupid . 
  if you insist upon trying to draw meaning from the sound of the word , instead of the commonly used defintion , [ you are n't much better than this troll ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/330da4/argentina_has_begun_legal_proceedings_against/cqhh4ki ) . 
  anti-semitism is about semites as much as xenophobia is about xenon light . 
  is this even real ? 
  no one can possibly be that dumb . 
  oh , you want to solve this thing , do you ? 
  it sounds simply , but it ai n't . 
  the only solution is the one you are hinting at . 
  though i have to disagree a bit . 
  horrible conditions is something else . 
  but the conditions are not nice either . 
  it is mainly a problem of bad governance in many countries and stagnant economies . 
  if people do n't see opportunity at home , they will seek it elsewhere . 
  so in order to ` solve ' the refugee problem , you have to change the political and economic situation at home . 
  but there is n't any strategy to do that . 
  [ in fact , we are doing the opposite in many ways . 
  ] ( http://web.mit.edu/mitir/2007/spring/fisheries.html ), 
  [ loop this shit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/330da4/argentina_has_begun_legal_proceedings_against/cqhh4ki ), 
  what is a correct definition ? 
  something you make up to fit your agenda , or the defintion that is in the encyclopedia ? 
  you are trolling are n't you ? 
  nobody can be ** that ** stupid . 
       pre-abrahamic societies were a lot less homophobic     i guess you are referring to the greeks , since those are the ones we have a lot of records about . 
     and the norse . 
  and the romans . 
  and the egyptians . 
  and the carthaginians ...   science does n't know how homosexuals were treated in ancient egypt , for example  science does n't address those kinda of questions . 
  again , i have no words . 
  but yes , finally i do : i think this post sums up our discussion pretty nicely . 
  unfortunately , there are [ many racists just like you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/330da4/argentina_has_begun_legal_proceedings_against/cqghzbh ) , using the same arguments . 
  i think op is not even talking about limiting the number of immigrants in any way . 
  his idea is about solely not accepting boat people to migitate the risk of drowning . 
  yes , people would simply choose other routes . 
  there are numerous ways to enter europe . 
  but immigrants inside of europe is a different issue . 
  we are currently horrified at people attempting to immigrate and dying in the thousands . 
  hijacking this , since this is very far up : while the idea sounds great on the surface , it has been tried in a way and , unfortunately does n't work . 
  here is why : those people exist . 
  what do we do with them . 
  send them `` back '' ? 
  where ? 
  we drew up plans to create giant detention centers in libya . 
  with the local government a couple years ago . 
  then something happened . 
  i do n't remember . 
  maybe we should ask some of the refugees coming here ? 
  jokes aside , those people often times `` lose '' their passports and refuse to say where they are coming from . 
  in order to send them somewhere , we would have to know where . 
  and in order to send people to senegal or nigeria , we have to use some sort of transportation , like ocean going ships or planes . 
  and since we are a not a tyranny , but a lawful society ( democracy , enlightenmend , rule of law and all that crap that all those xenophobes think they are defending , when they are actually attacking it ) , we have to have due process . 
  which means letting people in and processing them individually . 
  there used to be a european rule that countries that receive immigrants need to keep them and process them themselves . 
  afaik italy likes to give them train tickets and sends them northbound . 
  what we would need to do is make some kind of agreement with a northern african country like tunesia or algeria that they would `` receive '' all the asylum seekers . 
  though i am not sure that there is a lawful way to do that . 
  also i am not sure any country that is not government by gaddafi would be up for such a deal . 
  [ you are the one making an ass of himself by purposefully trying to misappropriate a commonly used word . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/330da4/argentina_has_begun_legal_proceedings_against/cqhjv5l ) what is next ? 
  racism must be about horses , because it has the word `` race '' in it ? 
  like in horse races ? 
  so you ca n't be racist , because you are not a horse ? 
  true . 
  because an [ ass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donkey ) is not a horse . 
  did you know that words we use in common language have definitions ? 
  those that are widely used . 
  anti-semitism is one of them . 
  you can either look up the words , before you use them , either in wikipedia or in any other encyclopedia , or you can read through the comments of the link i provided . 
   although the government has now made a policy of not reporting boat interceptions given the track record of the current australian government so far it is not unbelievable that any change in the number of boat people is just caused by forging the statistics to make their policy look good . 
  after all , that is what politics is about . 
  looking good . 
  that is why i posted the link . 
  i went through the exact same thing more than twice during the discussion . 
  shot answer : there is no difference between anti-semitism and islamophobia , btw . 
  except for the target religion . 
  for the long answer : read !, 
  you are doing it again . 
  when and how am i not honest ? 
  what exactly am i lying about ? 
  this is exactly what i am talking about . 
  you keep accusing me of outlandish stuff , but never back it up in any way . 
  i am supposed to be lying ( about what ) reframing `` the '' issue ( you keep refusing to say which one and how ) ... and every time i try to [ nail you down on one of your ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cqcd4gt ) asinine statements , you wiggle out of it by accusing me of something . 
  in this whole discussion you have hardly made a single correct statement . 
  i have long given up on correcting you on so many things ( science does n't know how homosexuals were treated in ancient egypt , for example ) , because you would only get angry and it would sidetrack the whole discussion on your blatant racism . 
  the only thing you were correct on was that this whole ordeal is completely and utterly pointless . 
  i have great patience . 
  but you act like a 12 year old brat . 
  which is probabely your real age . 
   i do n't get angry . 
  this is another really bad lie .
