  you just throw out those statements . 
  why are you not downvoted into oblivion ?? 
  everyone of my posts is , when i dare suggest opinions similar to the ones stated here . 
  what am i missing ? 
  btw . 
  kosovo , sadly was a nato war . 
  the rebuilding of kosovo is eu and nato responsibility . 
  that is our activity in the refugee problem area . 
   the usual suspects mhm  and somehow we 're the racist ones ca n't both be true ? 
  you are racist and those murderers on the boat are racist as well ? 
  where did i put my pitchfork ? 
  looks similar to a lot of places in the former gdr during the 90s . 
  and that would be a much more productive discussion . 
  what is there to `` discuss '' anyways . 
  murder is tabloid material . 
  there is n't much to discuss there , except a little racist circlejerk . 
  so what ? 
  we kill their babies , because they killed ours ? 
  it 's ok to kill babies , as long as it is a * response * ? 
   christians killing muslims do happen as well , and in numbers . 
  and even if that would n't happen if there would n't be a single instance where christianity was currently used for mass murder , there would still be no excuse for islamophobia . 
  shitty people are racist . 
  even shittier people kill others for racist or religious reasons . 
  haters gon na hate . 
  i have no idea what you are talking about . 
  you keep speaking in mystery . 
  you are correct . 
  you are god . 
   go fuck yourself . 
  speaks to your intellectual capacity . 
  in accordance with your political views . 
  that is all you got out of reading the whole thing ? 
  holy crap . 
  am i really that bad at communication ? 
  many europeans are racist . 
  i would wager the vast majority are . 
  i frequently catch myself having prejudiced thoughts myself . 
  it is so predomenent in culture and everyday things , you can hardly keep yourself from it . 
  the problem is not about racist and prejudiced thoughts , but about racist and prejudiced words , texts and actions . 
  especially if people do n't realize they are racist or even deny it . 
  classic example : `` i am not racist , but ... '' [ edit  i wrote that many europeans are racist . 
  this is a lie covered by a truth . 
  the point is that most people are racist , regardless of nationality , race or religion . 
  i could have written `` the vast majority of muslims are racist '' and it would have been equally correct . 
  my bad . 
  it sometimes is tiring to address racist shitlords again and again . 
  maybe they currently do n't have the time ? 
   in this case the victims and the perpetrators have the same race so it 's not racism if you hate blacks for shooting themselves . 
  only racism if you hate them for shooting whites ? 
  facepalm . 
  please refrain from further comments about racism until having at least reached a basic understanding of it . 
  cue tip : islamophobia is very , very closely related to racism . 
  [ i had this discussion before . 
  it took a month . 
  unfortunately .

   without reason try again . 
  even if you do n't agree with his reasons or even if his reasons are completely asinine , i am sure he has his reasons . 
  yea but , they are foreigners . 
  that is the reason we hate them . 
  shit the quran says just comes in handy as a good excuse . 
  well , excuse me . 
  i am still left confused as to how and why you were n't even able to grasp simple concepts like `` religion '' or `` racism '' , even after i spent considerable effort to explain them to you . 
  this leaves me sad . 
  not only because you have been left in the dark , but because i still do n't know where and how i failed you , preventing me from realizing a similar mistake in the future . 
  [ this is all besides the point anyways . 
  please answer here .

  uhm , the eu is not about military . 
  nato is . 
  there are good reasons to keep them seperate . 
  ukraine for example could have become part of eu while staying out of nato . 
  one important reason putin intervened was most likely the democratization of ukraine . 
  a modern , prosperous and democratic ukraine would soon spark unrest in russia itself . 
  another good reason was demonstrated in the 90s , when romania ( among others ) wanted to join nato asap , but were n't ready ( some argue they still are n't ) to join the eu . 
  you are right about no eu unity , when it comes to foreign policy . 
  this has always been the case . 
  nations have diverging interests . 
  there are numerous examples . 
  here is just one : spain has yet to recognize kosovo . 
  we do n't even agree on basic stuff . 
  nato is less about foreign policy and more about defense . 
  the us also divided the eu on iraq in 2002/2003 . 
  [ edit  also the us is still the only countries that can `` project '' any decent amount of force . 
  eu countries could n't * protect * other countries militarily , even if they wanted to , simply because they could n't rally enough troops in a short time and do n't have the logistics to move them or maintain them abroad . 
  is there a pre-abrahamic and a post-abrahamic in time ? 
  is there one region by region ? 
  is there one culturally/regionally ? 
  you know what abrahamic means , right ? 
  you know jewish history ? 
  you know christian history ? 
  i was wondering if you have more explanations , or sources . 
  [ edit  this is just a side point , actually , we really do n't need to discuss this . 
  simply post a link to your sources . 
  i would be interested to read them . 
   there is a clear `` pre-abrahamic '' and `` post-abrahamic '' , actually . 
  cronologically ? 
  locally ? 
  culturally ? 
  do you have source ?
