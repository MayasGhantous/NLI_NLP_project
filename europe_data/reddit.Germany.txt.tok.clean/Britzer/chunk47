  which is rampant in europe . 
  and if you were to read rationalwiki , instead of writing about it , you might also change a couple other points . 
  [ the article on anti-semitism ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/anti-semitism ) for example focuses on the cultural aspects . 
  not on the racial aspects of anti-semitism . 
  contradicting your earlier arguments on the matter . 
  again . 
  please read and comprehend . 
  and do n't rage and write oneliners . 
  i invite you , again , to read our discussion from the beginning and post any further questions you might have . 
  though i believe i did address all of your issues at large . 
   everyone else [ everyone else that wrote the article on anti-semitism in the encyclop\u00e6dia britannica ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpnumij ) everyone else that wrote the wikipedia article on racism including the cultural racism section ? 
  everyone else that makes youtube videos showing islamophobia when people wear a hijab ( are you still mad , btw . 
  because i asked you to wear one yourself to witness islamophobia ) ? 
  everyone else that wrote the wikipedia article on islamophobia ? 
  i am not spreading wisdom here . 
  i am merely reiterating widely known facts . 
  because i like you . 
  otherwise why would i waste my time explaining the same shit again and again that you can read anywhere on the internet ? 
  relax . 
  again : sorry if i was a little harsh back there . 
  you were being so obstreperous and it got to me . 
  how old are you ? 
  this is not a game where people go `` you stink '' -- `` no you '' . 
  racism is n't kiddy shit . 
  again : sorry if i caused you any grief . 
  as i explained at least twice in this thread ( hopefully you remember ) i do n't think prejudcies are so horrible . 
  everyone has them . 
  you just need to be aware of them and reflect upon them . 
  and not write racist shit like `` islamophobia does n't exist '' all over the internet . 
  if there was less of a stigma attached to prejudices , maybe more people would come to terms with theirs and we would have less bad effects of racism . 
  because you are . 
  no matter how hard you try to deny it . 
   you 've misrepresented from day one . 
  misrepresented what ? 
   who 's covering racism , but you ? 
  yes . 
  i explained to you , in great and exhausting detail , how racism and islamophobia are basically the same thing for the most part . 
  while you keep insisting that there is no such thing . 
  because people can `` leave '' islam . 
  guess what . 
  homophobia is still a thing , even though some people that are homosexual choose not to have relations with the same sex . 
  it really does n't matter what arbitrary feature you choose to hate people . 
  be it their brown eyes , their sexual orientation or their heritage . 
  at the end of the day , no matter how much you scream and shout : you are still a hater . 
  i already extensively addressed the difference between critisism and hate/racism/xenophobia . 
  i explained those things in detail . 
  mainly pointing out that for a racist the `` argument '' comes after the hate . 
  it is an excuse rather than a cause . 
  same applies to islamophobia . 
  i also criticised extremist islam , such as in saudi arabia , myself . 
  i condemned it . 
  i also condemned the violence . 
  also explaining how the west ( our countries ) is actually the driving force behind this kind of islam . 
  but i made that specific criticism . 
  such as `` i think the government of zimbabwe and personally robert mugabe is genocidal . '', 
  instead of such blanket racist statements as `` blacks are incapable of government '' . 
  do you see the difference ? 
  i also explained the difficult balance between free speech and censorship that we have in europe , for example regarding holocaust denial and other hate speech . 
  yet even though you claim to have read what i wrote , you still write that i equate criticism ( and free speech ) to racism . 
  which is bullshit . 
  what i did write ( can you remember this comment , i bet not ) is that racism is often covered by free speech and that while i do n't support the racism , i support the free speech . 
  you hide your racism by saying it is about `` criticism of religion '' . 
  and i point out your racism . 
  take the mugabe example again . 
  if someone was to say `` black people are incapable of government themselves '' and i was to point out their racism , they would answer ( in your spirit ) that i equate all criticism of black people to racism . 
  i do not . 
  all i do is that i equate islamophobia to racism . 
  and as i have wrote again and again and as you have claimed to read again and again i carefully explained why islamophobia is not criticism . 
  i wish i could deflect arguments . 
  but there are none . 
  again i must urge you to finally read my comments . 
  maybe the discussion from the beginning would be a good idea . 
  again : ** are you even reading these comments . ? 
  ** in most of them i touched upon the difference between critcism and hate . 
  maybe not directly , but at least indirectly . 
  i also touched upon the vast nature of islam . 
  as in numbers of people involved in different roles and also the diversity of the word itself . 
  you defend your racism by saying you only want to critcise , for example , certain people from front national , yet you defend those that scream that they hate france and actively discriminate against french people . 
  fn is certainly part of france . 
  but france is a little more than a single political party . 
  [ here i explained in detail , why `` critcism of islam '' may currently be a bad idea for different reasons . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpjsnpz ) though [ most of the time `` critcism of islam '' will only attract racists that take part in circlejerks . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geert_wilders ) which is why most of these `` discussions '' are completely fruitless endeavors anyways . 
  i touched upon other issues in [ my comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpx1twl ) as well . 
  but be my guest . 
  [ get started and finally read my comments . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpx1twl ) let 's finally have a discussion . 
  i never wrote that religion is above criticism . 
  why would i write that . 
  and again , as in almost any post , you do not answer to a single point . 
  you have n't given a single example where charlie hebdo fought sexism . 
  you did n't respond to hook noses in ch , you are not even writing what you think makes a comic homophobic and what not . 
  and what your arguments are against the arguments that charlie hebdo is homophobic . 
  there is no discussion going on . 
  i doubt that you even read , much less comprehend my answers . 
  which is pretty sad , btw . 
  fixed, 
  you seem to know a lot about charlie hebdo that i do n't . 
  that said , what makes a cartoon racist or homophobic in your opinion ?
