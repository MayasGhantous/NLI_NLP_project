  i always thought it was about reinforcing stereotypes . 
  like drawing lesbians always as butch , ugly and man hating . 
  or putting a lot of emphasis on racist features . 
  like huge lips for blacks . 
  and , of course , appealing to negative racial stereotypes . 
  for example showing black people as lazy and laying around . 
  like in my [ beloved lucky luke comics ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/it/book/lucky-luke-tome-16-en-remontant/id510689363?l=en&amp;mt=11 ) , where the black ship workers are always shown sitting with their eyes closed , when they are n't forced to load or unload a ship . 
  one example for anti semitic satire was always the hook nose . 
  a feature charlie hebdo uses all the time to depict muslims . 
  or the turban , that i mentioned , that charlie hebdo uses , even though muslims do n't even wear a turban . 
  though this is a very old stereotype , some people still get confused , as in the shooting of sikh people we already talked about . 
  but i disgress . 
  what is your opinion ? 
  when and how does charlie hebdo does not use racist stereotypes ? 
  when do they fight homophobia ? 
  and again : why do you think islamophobia is n't a huge problem in europe , when ** half of the danish population reportedly wants muslims out of denmark . 
  ** as i already stated . 
  i can understand why you would deny your own racism . 
  but i just ca n't get my head around the denial about islamophobia . 
  like standing in a wood and denying the existence of trees . 
  in what way are the articles racist ? 
  and what would be changing ? 
  and what does n't change ? 
  and you , again , did not respond to any of my points , btw . 
  why do you complain about the topic of the discussion ...   [ then you need to re-read the title . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpx3epb ) ... if you do n't discuss any of the arguments presented ? 
  charlie hebdo made racist , homophobic and sexist cartoons . 
  they should n't have been killed over them . 
  while i will defend their ( and your ) right to spread racism , this is free speech , after all , i will not defend their ( and your ) racism . 
  i will , in fact , critizise it . 
  i will fight it . 
  though neither with censorship , nor with violence . 
  putting racist , sexist and homophobic cartoons in a schoolbook might be a bad idea , depending on context . 
  what do you think ? 
  well , i already stated at length why it might be a bad idea to put the cartoons in the textbook [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cplgt1s ) . 
  you did not discuss these points at all . 
  we are not discussing these points because you chose not to . 
  i also made a [ lengthy post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpjsnpz ) explaining why any `` critic '' of islam , justified or not , may be a bad idea in the current islamophobic climate in europe , because this discussion causes more harm than it may help . 
  which is why many people loath these `` discussions '' , even if they hate religion . 
  they hate the people and opinions that join these `` discussions '' even more . 
  but again , you chose not to debate those points . 
  you wrote that [ islam is not a culture ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp8kqma ) and [ deny that islamophobia even exists ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp8kuwn ) . 
  i am mainly trying to get you to explain those points . 
  i brought plenty of evidence to this discussion that refutes those points ( easy , since they are nonsensical ) , but unfortunately i have the feeling you did n't even read what i wrote , because you were angry that i called you out on them . 
  if you do n't want to go back to read what i wrote for whatever reason , here are also two very good articles dicussing the cartoons and why they are bad : http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2015/01/in-the-wake-of-charlie-hebdo-free-speech-does-not-mean-freedom-from-criticism/#sthash.5pjqvtxj https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/01/charlie-hebdo-islamophobia/, 
   but when have i ever supported any of that ? 
  you are islamophobic , deny that islamophobia is relevant and thus play down the problems we face with hate against muslims in europe . 
  you support those people . 
  and their causes . 
  one of the chief ones being the `` limit to muslim immigration '' . 
  censorship is a whole different topic . 
  i pointed this out before . 
  there are many , many limits to our freedom of press . 
  and if you really take a look , not even the most extreme islamists have a problem with critizising muslims . 
  they have a problem when their prophet is depicted . 
  which is n't really necessary . 
  everything you want to make a cartoon about ( especially concerning islam and muslim countries ) can easily be achieved without depicting mohammed . 
  this is not to say it should be illegal . 
  i am not in favour of censorship . 
  but you do n't have to be an asshole and shit on other people 's believes . 
  there are plenty of ways to still critizise them . 
  you can make cartoons about the role of women in muslim society , or lgbt or whatever . 
  why would the prophet need to be included in the depiction ? 
  this is not to say that it is ok to harm people that do make a cartoon about mohammed . 
  we have freedom of speech . 
  which includes the assholes . 
  you know , like the ones that spread hate speech ? 
  actually no . 
  that is illegal . 
  but i do n't hear you defend hate speech against lgbt . 
  making that legal , for example . 
  no harm should come to assholes , nonetheless . 
  but this is n't the point . 
  islamophobia has nothing to do with cartoons and censorship . 
  remember ? 
  the racist does n't care about what the target of his racism does . 
  do they bomb cartoonists ? 
  or shoot them ? 
  those are excuses for racism . 
  not causes . 
   this is about cartoons and censorship no as i explained more than once before in this thread . 
  this is not about cartoons and censorship . 
  as i wrote , i am sorry if this caused you any discomfort . 
  as i already stated , i am pretty baffled by your denial of the existence of islamophobia , despite the link to the story about the survey , where roughly half of respondents in denmark wanted to `` limit muslims immigration '' . 
  that is discrimination in immigration from muslim countries . 
  you even wrote that you once were close to a person from morocco . 
  that person would n't be in europe , if islamophobia had been here earlier and more successful . 
  no matter what she believes . 
  in pracitce , people lie on immigration applications . 
  so the only possible way to limit `` muslim immigration '' ( and i suppose that is how the respondents would want to enforce this anyways ) is to simply ban immigration from muslim countries . 
  no matter what people say they believe in . 
  ayaan hirsi ali would have never been allowed in europe . 
  she even says that she once believed in a very conservative interpretation of islam herself . 
  that is what islamophobia is . 
  and if the survey is representative in any way , the results would be roughly similar in other european countries . 
  europe has a large proportion ( 20 , 30 , 50 , 60 % ? ), 
  of islamophbobes . 
  why exactly would you deny the mere existence of islamophobia ? 
  i also did a little research on your statement ( 10 seconds google search ) and found out that more than half of the countries with a death penalty for gays are not in africa : http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/24/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death/ but , that is just facts . 
  nothing that will get 140 upvotes on reddit .
