  there is more than one country in the continent of africa . 
  your comment :  they 'll oppress anyone not part of their own group . 
  they meaning muslims , yes/no ? 
  my `` interpretation '' :  muslims in europe oppress everyone else in your opinion ? 
  where , exactly , is the difference ? 
  muslims in europe oppress everyone else in your opinion ? 
  that is beyond stupid . 
  you are blaming the victim . 
  but that is part of racism , i suppose . 
  fear is a root cause . 
  let 's leave your islamophobia behind for a moment . 
  people generally do n't believe they are or do evil . 
  you said it yourself a couple posts ago . 
  one thing that totally baffles me is why you think there is no islamophobia in europe . 
  in face of all the most obvious evidence . 
  let 's even pretend for a moment , that people are not born into islam , even though ali stated the opposite in a video you linked to . 
  let 's pretend islam is n't one of the world 's largest and most diverse religions , but some obscure cult . 
  if everyone from that cult is discriminated against , for which there is plenty of evidence , why would you still claim this is not the case ? 
   i 'm not stupid enough not to see that christian theocrats and muslim theocrats are the exact same thing . 
  which is why one group has a lot of influence in europe and uses it to surpress the other . 
  and the other way around in other places in the world . 
  and in your opinion , that oppression does n't exist , because * muslims , something , something bad * ? 
  so you think the muslims are a powerful entitiy in europe that can take people away ? 
  [ or are they more a small and powerless minority ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_minaret_referendum,_2009 ) i would say they have a ** lot ** less influence than , for example , gay males in germany . 
  so far we had two openly gay minister-presidents ( hamburg and berlin ) and one openly gay foreign minister . 
  [ muslims ? 
  nowhere to be seen .

  first they came for the socialists , and i did not speak out -- because i was not a socialist . 
  then they came for the trade unionists , and i did not speak out -- because i was not a trade unionist . 
  then they came for the jews , and i did not speak out -- because i was not a jew . 
  then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak for me . 
  - [ pastor martin niem\u00f6ller ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_they_came_ ... ), 
  `` i am not worried about a couple hundred islamists . 
  what i am worried about is thousands marching in demonstrations for right wing populism . '', 
  -- a homosexual friend of mine about [ islamophobic demonstrations in dresden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pegida ) pegida is allied with the [ afd , one of the few successful right wing populist parties in germany . 
  who do you think is going to be next on their list of targets , once they are done with muslims ?

  comeone . 
  would n't you try to debate someone that thinks homophobia is n't an issue in europe ? 
  i am sorry if i have caused you distress . 
  apart from the `` racist '' thing i do not believe i wrote anything that could be upsetting to you . 
  maybe the `` numbers '' comment . 
  sorry about that as well . 
   i 'm not arguing on your little piece of logic , but on the bigger picture on what means to not stand by or not accept to be associated with gypsies . 
  you clearly either do n't get my point or have a somewhat twisted xenophbobic-mind-twist-idea . 
   than you will see how it is for romanians when your fellows find out they 're romanians and then think gypsy cause they heard it from clarkson and all the hate and despise comes to their eyes . 
  so it 's ok , if romani 's are despised . 
  but not ok if romanians are mistaken for romani and then despised ? 
  either the hate is bad or not bad , imho . 
  no matter who is hated . 
  you seem to somehow think hating romanians is worse than hating romani . 
  why ? 
  what do maps have to do with trying to cling to power using people as cannon fodder ? 
   so if there 's plenty of dislike of gypsies across europe , which means it 's commonplace , then why the fuck you pretend that someone should not defend himself against being called a gypsy . 
  you are really asking that question ? 
  i am at a loss how to answer that . 
  ok : preschool setting . 
  one kid : mike . 
  poor . 
  bullied all the time . 
  gets beaten up all the time by the other kids . 
  second kid : sid . 
  rich . 
  likes to bully other kids . 
  especially mike . 
  beats him up every day . 
  likes to see mike bleeding . 
  third kid : anthony . 
  poor . 
  also a bully , but not as strong as sid . 
  so he beats up mike , because mike is an easy target . 
  one day a teacher sees sid screaming at anthony : you are such a looser . 
  you are an idiot . 
  you are weak and lazy . 
  you are a total mike . 
  and anthony goes : ** i am not mike !, 
  ** now mike is roma and sinti . 
  sid is clarkson and anthony is romania . 
  while it is wrong to call anthony mike , because anthony is clearly not mike , most of us europeans think that anthony should n't take being called mike as an insult . 
  the much bigger problem here is the rampant bullying . 
  both against anthony , but especially against mike . 
  by defending himself against the apparent insult being called `` mike '' , anthony reinforces the stereotype that mike is an idiot and deserves the bullying . 
  sid is clearly wrong . 
  and an idiot bully . 
  but anthony is n't better than sid . 
  if he would be better , he would n't get upset at being called `` mike '' . 
  actually , during that exchange ( `` you are `` mike '' - `` no , i am not stinky , poor , idiot mike '' ) both are bullying mike instead of each other . 
  in your opinion , anthony should have a right to bully mike , because everyone else does ? 
  or should have the right to openly be offended at being called `` mike '' and thus bully mike that way ? 
  how do you feel when someone would be mistaken for you and clearly be disgusted ? 
  `` omg , i am not that stinky idiot . 
  i am someone else ! '', 
   they have do n't much political representation . 
  who would have thought ? 
   i think the government 's stance is that gypsies are ` europe 's problem ' and not a romanian problem . 
  why are `` gypsies '' a * problem * ? 
  maybe i did read biased reports on the falkland war , but as far as i understand , some military dictatorship ran into internal problems and decided to turn people into cannon fodder in order to deflect from those . 
  should n't the people be mad at the generals instead of jeremy clarkson ?
