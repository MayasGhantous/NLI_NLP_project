  romanians seem to have taken issue with me pointing at the apparently rampant antiziganism in romania . 
  well , there is plenty of evidence for tons of antiziganism everywhere in europe . 
  and on / r/europe . 
  talk about gypsies and the knives come out . 
  best example , imho , was that story about the supposed `` stolen '' ( blond ) young girl , that lived with some family in greece . 
  there is an age old ( probabely hundreds of year ) stereotype that gypsies steal babies . 
  and almost every single european tv station and publication ran that juicy bit about the gypsies having stolen a blond baby and raising it as their own . 
  if that does n't tell us a story about antiziganism , what will ? 
   they complain about being stigmatised as gypsies , but in that same sentence stigmatise gypsies themselves . 
  they ? 
  clarkson seems to have both insulted roma and also thrown roma and romanians into the same pot . 
  but instead of being outraged at the insult to one of their ethnic minorities , the romanians seemed to have taken issue with the latter part , thus reinforcing the former . 
  why do i repeat myself ? 
  also as far as i read , there was nothing from the sinti and roma community themselves about this one . 
  i guess they are used to it ? 
  relax dude . 
  i am sorry if i offended you . 
  the ambassador was probabely not quoted right . 
  what he probabely said was this : * while the sinti and roma only make up a small percentage of the romanian population , we are nonetheless proud of their heritage and the contributions they made to our country . 
  we are therefore irritated at some pejorativ comments that were made on the show top gear . 
  please cut them from future airings . 
  * and he most likely did n't write : * hello top gear . 
  look , those gypsies only make up 2,5 % of the romanian population . 
  so please refrain from calling us gypsies . 
  * and yes , most of europe is overwhelmingly infested with antiziganism . 
  that is some deep seated stuff going back hundreds of years , when racism was n't even a thing here , due to the lack of other races . 
  it is similar to anti-semitism in that way , i suppose . 
  i get it , you are making a dickish comment and are supposed to reveal something . 
  hahaha . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/top_gear_controversies i skimmed through the stuff . 
  clarkson seems to have a long history blurting out homophobic and racist stuff . 
  but in the end , someone at bbc could have reviewed it and cut out the shit before airing . 
  so i feel the guilt is on both ends . 
  clarkson said it , but the bbc aired it . 
  funny sidenote : in the part about the romania incident , the romanians were all pissed that they were called `` gypsies '' . 
  even the ambassador . 
  no one seemed to take issue with the word `` gypsy '' or the pejorative depiction of roma people . 
  in fact , the [ antiziganism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiziganism ) was reinforced , because they mainly objected to being thrown in with * those gypsies * . 
  way to go romania , i must note . 
  sometimes it takes some racist dick comments to reveal a lot of shit .

  what exactly did you want to convince me of ? 
  you said xenophobias are only `` real '' if they are about genetics . 
  islam would n't count , because it is not genetic . 
  you also said that islam is n't culture . 
  both of which are easily disprovable . 
  so what is it ? 
  what makes islamophobia less `` real '' than homophobia ? 
  yea , but the reaction is so totally overblown , that i have trouble finding the causes burried below all that reaction . 
  as soon as charlie hebdo got hit , it became huge . 
  [ those islamist bastards seem to have the greatest public relations machine in history . 
  ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html ) they probabely killed less people in syria than how many would have been killed if assad people controlled the same area . 
  i think the war is now at well over 200.000 body count . 
  but all we see on tv are some single executions . 
  hell if i wanted to watch some single guy get executed , i would try to get tv access for us prison executions . 
  though i have to admit that isis puts on great shows . 
  `` it might seem like a silly issue but i 've seen this happened before when i am invited to speak . 
  these conditions are imposed to conflate the notice that muslims and islamists and one and the same . '', 
  you see , you get things so fundamentally wrong , that we are not talking about opinions here . 
  wether you convince me or i convince you of an opinion . 
  this is more about trying to talk some sense into you . 
  for example this one :  [ antisemitism is n't about religion , idiot . 
  an atheist jew would be a target of it , whereas a non-ethnically-jewish jew would n't . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpa65qw ) a target for anti semitic actions is n't a target , because they are atheist or religious or ethnical . 
  a target is a target , because the anti semitist decides the target is a target . 
  and because people wearing cloth associated with judaism are the most easily identifiable , they will get the `` street hate '' . 
  people with jewish names would be the target in administrative circumstances , where someone sees the name . 
  i repeadetly tried to explain that to you by example of the sikh shooting . 
  but you stubbornly try to ignore the most basic and logical facts . 
  why ? 
   you 'll never be convinced you want to convince me that ~ ~ homophobia ~ ~ islamophobia does n't exist . 
  because you hate ~ ~ gays ~ ~ mulims . 
  wait no . 
  you want to convince me that xenophobias are justified , when you hate people that have features that are n't genetic . 
  like disabled people that got disabled by accidents , instead of their genes . 
  or jews that converted . 
  anti semitism is only justified , if you hate their religion , not if you hate their genetics . 
  did i get that right ? 
  as i have tried and tried again to explain : racism is ultimately not about race , but about the racist . 
  it does n't matter if human races exist or not . 
  same with islamophobia . 
  ultimately islamophobia is not about islam , but the islamophobe . 
  the racist will give you tons of reasons why that race is bad , or why racism is justified . 
  the islamophobe will give you tons of reasons why islam is bad . 
  and they pin their hate on arbitrary features with which they think they can identify the object of their hate . 
  [ as i explained before in a comment on homophobia . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpj9wmz ) you do accept that antisemitism exists , right ? 
  yes/no you do accept that antisemitism is the reason why hitler killed 6 million jews , right ? 
  to experience antisemitism , you only need to wear a kippah and walk the steets . 
  like the videos on youtube i linked to . 
  you do n't need to be born into judaism . 
  you do n't even need to be a jew to experience antisemitism . 
  because antisemitism is n't about jews .
