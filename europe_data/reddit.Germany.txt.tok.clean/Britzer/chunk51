  it is about anti semites . 
  it does n't matter what jews do or not do . 
  though anti semites will have the greatest explanations why jews are evil . 
  most of those revolve around israel these days . 
  so islamophobes have the best explanations why islam is evil . 
  and thus they hate muslims . 
  but each islamophobe is different . 
  so the dumb guy in the us killed a bunch of sikhs . 
  because it really does n't matter for racism what religion someone belongs to . 
  the racist matters . 
  and what they thing . 
  so whatever the saudi government decides to do with badawi . 
  or with anyone else does n't matter . 
  the islamophobe wo n't make a difference between the saudi government and some poor guy from indonesia . 
  which is why you brought him into this conversation . 
  which is why you probabely also would have mentioned isis . 
  or other stuff other evil people do that happen to be muslim . 
  one more point : i wasted a lot of time `` defending '' islam . 
  because let 's face it : islam is harmless compared to so much other shit in the world . 
  in the ethnic strive in and around the drc they use rape as a weapon of war . 
  mass rape . 
  millions of victims . 
  and because of the prevalence of hiv/aids in this region , this can be considered biological warfare on top . 
  that 's just one of many contemporary examples . 
  we already went through history and how deadly post religious , enlightened , societies can be when we took a look at the 20th century at communism and fascism . 
  but again . 
  defending islam is dumb in this context , even if it is harmless . 
  because islamophobia , as demonstrated above , is ultimately not about islam in the end . 
  just like racism . 
  but now i am anxious . 
  after i have demonstrated that antisemites use religion as an excuse for their hate , will you also deny that antisemitism exists ? 
  [ encyclopedia britannica : anti-semitism , hostility toward or discrimination against jews as a religious ** or ** racial group . 
  ] ( http://www.britannica.com/ebchecked/topic/27646/anti-semitism ) i think the only reason why you refuse to wear the hijab and experience islamophobia for yourself is because you know damn well that islamophobia is rampant where you live and you are simply afraid of the islamophobia of your neighbors . 
  yet you refuse to aknowledge it even exists . 
  is n't that disgusting ? 
   you ca n't seem to differentiate race and religion i repeadetly explained that there is more to that equation . 
  again , i must implore you to reread that conversation . 
  you never commented on my arguments , but simply repeated your statements . 
  also scientists have more or less confirmed that there are no races that divide humans . 
  only superficial differences . 
  does that make racism non existent ? 
  for the purpose of racism , `` race '' is just an arbitrary label like `` muslim '' . 
  an islamophobe will see someone with a turban and hate them . 
  or a woman with a hijab . 
  [ just like an anti semite will hate a person with a kippah . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kippah+walk ), 
   would n't that be sikhophobia ? 
  they 're very different religions , you know . 
  [ again , i must urge you to reread our conversation . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpczuv9 ) why do you keep insisting that badawi is an atheist . 
  his blog is most likely not even about religion as a whole . 
  there are so many things wrong and corrupt in saudi arabia ( as i pointed out , people disappear and are executed for trumped up charges that have no relation to why they disappeared ) that you do n't need to question islam in any way . 
  even if you discuss their braindead `` version '' of islam from a more moderate viewpoint they will throw you into prison or worse . 
  badawi is most likely a muslim . 
  for people in saudi arabia or similar places it is not about believing in a book . 
  it is part of the culture . 
  part of who they are . 
  they do n't discuss religion like we do . 
  islam is part of their identity . 
  [ you should at least read the biography part of the wikipedia article on ali . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ayaan_hirsi_ali#early_life_and_education ) she even subscribed to the extreme saudi version of islam when she came to europe . 
   but no , to you they 're not even atheists . 
  apparently , you consider religion to be some sort of immutable element inherent to a person and necessary to his/her survival . 
   my ex came from a muslim ( moroccan ) background . 
  you should ask her how deeply entwined culture and religion are in morocco . 
   she 'd have punched your teeth out for insinuating she was a muslim . 
  so much for hate and advocating violence . 
  :-( (  if `` not censoring cartoons nor defending the murderers of cartoonists '' is wrong murdering people is horribly wrong . 
  censorship is wrong ( at least in my opinion , though i respect people that want to censor hate speech , for example hate speech against lgbt ) . 
  unfortunately there are evil people on this planet . 
  people that advocate for violence . 
  people that commit violence . 
  terrorists . 
  making all muslims responsible for the actions of a view is a classic for islamophobia . 
  or for any xenophobia . 
  you simply point to some horrible act , take his race , nationality or some other trait and then make everyone who shares that trait responsible for the actions of that individual , even though they have nothing to do with it . 
  for example hans van themsche . 
  are all belgians racist killers , because themsche is ? 
  though this style of debate you are using and having used before on saudi arabia , holding muslims the world over responsible for the actions of the saudi government , shows your racist attitude towards muslims . 
   why is something suddenly a problem , while no one was batting an eye 10 years ago ... that change in reaction from none to this there you have your answer . 
  10 years ago us culture was n't nearly as prevalent in europe . 
   is the whole world going sjw or am i missing something ? 
  is everything racist today , except telling white people their culture is wrong ? 
  that is ** loaded ** . 
  as i explained . 
  but hey . 
  everyone except me agrees with you . 
  so why bother ? 
   when the fuck did i advocate mistreating anyone ? 
  you reiterate that islamophobia does n't exist . 
  in the face of all the evidence to the contrary that i presented . 
  islamophobia results in plenty of violence against muslims . 
  like the sikh shooting . 
  in trying to deflect from the issue ( islamophobia ) and denying the reason for the violence ( islamophobia ) . 
  while you are not directly advocating violence , you contribute to the climate in which violence thrives . 
  you also seem to support the notion of limiting muslim immigration to europe , if i understood you correctly . 
  which is discrimination . 
  you also seem to really hate muslims , even though you wo n't admit to it . 
  the hate seems to almost drip from every line . 
  still posting to reddit ?
