  i made four basic , easy to comprehend points and backed them up with arguments and links to basic definitions : 1 . 
  a religion is more than a basic ideology . 
  you keep coming back to that . 
  [ a religion is an organized collection of beliefs , cultural systems , and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion ) it is the first sentence , for cryin out loud . 
  i patiently explained why it does n't really matter the hate is directed at an ideology or a religion or something else . 
  a xenophobia that is directed towards something that encompasses millions of people , inlcuding countries and children , even spanning continents is closely related to racism . 
  it does n't matter what the target of racism does or is . 
  the feature the racist is targeting is arbitrary . 
  racism is about the racist . 
  antisemitism is about religion . 
  it is in the definition on the wikipedia page . 
  antiziganism is about a culture . 
  those are widely recognized xenophobic sentiments . 
  religion encompasses culture . 
  see above . 
  i made and explained those points more than once . 
  this and the confusion regarding the comparison between nazism and islam as well as the `` being born into islam '' bring be back to my original point in this thread . 
  [ if you offend people , you wo n't any have a fruitful discussion . 
  no matter how right or wrong you are . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp7cgbe ) [ mutangw got 400 upvotes for argueing that muslims should be confronted with the muhammad carricatures in order to `` understand '' how they are `` wrong '' . 
  he writes that offending people will help them comprehend things . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp7951q ) i received 9 downvotes for ridiculing such an outrageous statement . 
  you raged so hard for such a long time , insulted me almost every single comment , barely read my comments , much less comprehend them , just because i correctly pointed out your racism . 
  even though i assured you that racism is common and half of europe shares your sentiment . 
  imagine how muslims must feel if you start of the discussion by ridiculing the core of their believes by displaying the muhammed carricatures . 
  the number of upvotes for such an asinine idea is more evidence how prevelant islamophobia is . 
  even on reddit . 
  note : i do n't even debate the offensiveness or the right to publish the caricatures in this argument . 
  i just point out how stupid it is no matter what religion , ideology or idea is debated . 
  and our discussion , again , proves my point . 
   still comparing ideas to accidents of births . 
  fuck it , you 're too thick . 
  i 've been more than patient . 
  ok , i 'll be even more patient and try one last time : if i criticise libertarianism , am i randianophobic ? 
  if i criticise communism , am i communistophobic ? 
  religions belong to the same grouping as political ideologies , not accidents of birth . 
  you are wrong about all of these . 
  and i explained to you in detail why . 
  and i gave you lots of references . 
  and not some obscure stuff . 
  you only need to read the first couple sentences from the wikipedia articles on `` religion '' , for example . 
  or antisemitism . 
  just the definition . 
  which you define differently from the rest of the world . 
  i did n't link to hour long videos . 
  you probabely did n't even watch the video , did you ? 
  one of the first couple sentences is this : `` when i was born into islam . '', 
  do you know what that means ? 
  then she goes on to speak about concepts that are the same in christianity and islam . 
  and then i stopped watching , because i do n't have hours of time . 
  well , if you make up your own world and language and refuse to include islamophobia , than that is your problem . 
  most of the rest of us lives in reality . 
   i 'm not comparing islam to nazism , you moron , i 'm saying , and pay attention , for it 's only the fucking 15th time you did n't get it : compare ideology with ideology !, 
  actually you are . 
   secondly : damn , i knew you would misunderstand that . 
  well , if i write that i hate muslims . 
  but in my mind i actually love muslims , would i be to blame if someone was to think i hate muslims after i write so ? 
  i did n't misunderstood what you wrote . 
  i may have misunderstood what you think . 
  so if you knew that your sentences would be interpreted not the way you meant them , why did you write them in the first place ? 
  do n't you think this is getting a little silly ? 
  probabely half of europe is islamophobic . 
  including yourself . 
  and you still deny it even exists . 
  do n't you think that this is even more silly ? 
  ask a casual homophobic ( * i am not against gays , i just do n't want them near my family * ) person if they are homophobic . 
  and they will go to great length to explain that they are not . 
  as the casual racist ( * i am not racist , but those dumb niggers should know their place * ) if they are racist . 
  and they will deny it . 
  during our discussion we did establish that a lot of your presumptions were erroneous :  religions are just ideas i explained to you that a religion encompasses organizations , people in different roles , a history , a culture , ... [ read it yourself ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion )   there are a lot of xenophobias . 
  some get a name and special treatment ( anti-semitism , , antiziganism , racism , islamophobia ) . 
   one of those is n't like the others . 
  i 'll let you guess which . 
  hint : it 's the one pertaining to an ideology rather than an ethnicity . 
  antiziganism goes against a culture . 
  so your believe that all xenophobias are related to genetic issues is wrong . 
  as i already explained . 
   antisemitism is n't about religion , idiot . 
  [ actually antisemitism can be about ethnicity and / ** or ** race . 
  so in many cases it is about religion . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism ) also i tried to explain to you that being racist seems to be part of being human . 
  we classify people from the moment we see them . 
  the only thing we can do is try to mute our racist comments written and verbal and act without prejudices towards other people , no matter what label our brains have attached to them . 
  many people do n't realize this , because racism is a taboo subject . 
  we * may not be racist * . 
  because that is evil . 
  we still are . 
  but we deny it . 
  at least in many cases . 
  this results in these studies where half of denmark wants to `` limit muslim immigration '' . 
  as in * we do n't like those stinky camel herders here in our nice little country * . 
  now about `` critizising islam '' i go even one step further . 
  there is a need for discussion on the more conservative ideas and dogmas . 
  but who are you talking to and who are you having this discussion with ? 
  what effect does this discussion have ? 
  there are major issues in black culture in the us . 
  but who discusses those issues ? 
  and with which intent ? 
  and what are the intended consequences of these discussions ?
