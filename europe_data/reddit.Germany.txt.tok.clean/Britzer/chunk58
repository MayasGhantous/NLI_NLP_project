  people like you and islamists oppose this . 
   i do n't care about the numbers ' game , anyway . 
  unfortunately there is a lot of evil in the world . 
  and in order to do it justice , you have to weigh it . 
  dictator a that kills a million people is worse than dictator b that kills a thousand people . 
  in your opinion both are the same ? 
  you think hitler is as bad as pinochet ? 
  stalin is not worse than assad ? 
   for the tenth time : hatred of a religion is n't bigotry and hating a religion is n't hating its adherents . 
  [ and again : most islamophobes do n't differentiate between the religion and it 's believers . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2uvd2z/half_of_danes_want_to_limit_muslims_in_denmark/ ) . 
  they are not against islam . 
  they hate muslims . 
  what is so difficult to understand about that ? 
  or do you believe it is justified to hate muslims , because some people interpret islam in an oppressive way ? 
  would it be ok to hate russians , because a majority of them support putin ? 
  what abou the russians that live here in europe ? 
  a couple points : a ) i guess you describe the time between 800 and 2000 ad . 
  1200 years . 
  that is a long time . 
  also history is n't very accurate throughout it all . 
  i guess the most accurate sources on islam from the beginning all throughout the middle ages would be islamic sources themselves . 
  and they would like to paint themselves in the best light . 
  that being said , any `` great '' nation conquered and killed . 
  be it venice , rome , mongolians , chinese , portugese , spanish , dutch , english , ... islam conquest , be it with the sword or anything else , is nothing special . 
  take spain as an example . 
  the reconquista was n't `` unbloody '' . 
  they did kill a lot of people to take over spain from the muslims that lived there for a couple hundred years or so . 
  before that the muslims invaded spain . 
  they most definately killed a lot of people as well . 
  b ) do n't inflate numbers . 
  a life is a life . 
  and , unfortunately , they were n't worth much back then . 
  if you wanted to be remembered by history , you had to win wars . 
  and make war . 
  and let a lot of people die . 
  c ) why would i use shady websites for research . 
  there is history books . 
  and those also have estimates for population and population loss through war . 
  that is science , you know . 
  one of those advances that we got when we left the dark ages . 
  post religious if you so will . 
  believing shit on the internet is the same as believing shit in holy books . 
  history is a science . 
  d ) there is a lot of hate speech on the internet . 
  you can find shit on anything . 
  9/11 conspiracy is very popular as well . 
  or the elders of zion . 
  fun stuff . 
  not accurate . 
  if you want to find bad stuff about islam in science , it is easy . 
  and well sources : http://necrometrics.com/pre1700b.htm#islave bad muslim slave traders . 
  but put into perspective , they are n't better or worse than people and religions around them at the same time . 
  give or take a million here or there : http://necrometrics.com/pre1700a.htm and as i stated before . 
  when we europeans got rid of our religion and the 20th century rolled around ( which is much more relevant for us today than much older stuff ) , we really got into killing . 
  the muslim slave trade mentioned above ? 
  the muslims took over 1200 years to amass about 19 million black people dead from slave trade . 
  it took us europeans only 4 years in wwi to kill 15 million people . 
  how is that for perspective ? 
  [ islamophobia is a term for prejudice against , hatred towards , or fear of the religion of islam , muslims , or of ethnic groups perceived to be muslim . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamophobia ) . 
  so you would say there is no hatred for islam in europe ? 
  no islamophobia ? 
  there is no prejudice against muslims ? 
  no islamophobia ? 
  [ and there is no one that wrongly perceives people as muslims that are n't and is racist against them ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wisconsin_sikh_temple_shooting )   islamophobia : a word invented by fascists and used by cowards to manipulate morons . 
  mhm . 
  whatever you think about islam . 
  people hate and/or fear muslims . 
  and that sentiment is widespread and has a name : islamophobia . 
  think about islam what you will . 
  even if you think it is bad or evil , even you ca n't deny the fact that during the last century few mass casulties can be directly attributed to islam . 
  i would even discount obvious culprits like the war in afghanistan between the mujahideen and the sowjets . 
  because it was essentially a cold war conflict as well as a regional conflict in which pakistan and the sowjet union wrestled for influence in afghanistan . 
  with the us , saudi arabia and pakistan on the one side and the sowjet union on the other . 
  saudi arabia being the only participant with a religious motive . 
  and they would n't have participated without explicit us approval . 
  a clear guilty party are the conflicts between india and pakistan and the massacres on both sides all throughout the 20th century . 
  considering the tension between the two nuclear armed states ( one of them being our ally in the war against terror , guess which one ) , that one could add to the body count . 
  a lot . 
  it would be very interesting to read , though , how exactly you want to pin the tensions between hindu and muslims on the indian subcontinent on `` islam ideology '' . 
  you brought in the term [ theocracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theocracy ) into the discussion . 
  i wanted to shed some light on the fact that we ( nato countries ) are mainly responsible for the remaining theocracies in the mideast that export their medieval version of islam and sponsor terrorism . 
  those countries that serve as the religious model for the taliban and isis , provided initial funding and may still support them . 
  there is no doubt that the governments ( royal families ) of those countries do despicable things and are not worthy of any support . 
  without intervention they would have been swept away during the arab nationalisation in the 60s and 70s . 
  but instead we even tried to keep the monarchy in power in iran as well . 
  [ i tried to address your other grievances in my answer here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cpcq9fk ) it is a side, 
  on the topic of theocracies . 
  the five theocracies of the middle east are kuwait , uae , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . 
  none of them would exist today without strong military support from western countries . 
  they do n't exist because muslims support them . 
  they exists , because they give us oil and oppress the locals . 
  so they are mainly a product of our hunger for oil and our lack of qualms on the source . 
  the current excuse for supporting these bloodthirsty monarchies is `` stability '' . 
  we even went to war in a massive effort in 1991 to bring kuwait back to their theocracy and protect the one in saudi arabia . 
  this whole thing started , because you objected to the term `` islamophobia '' . 
   you still ca n't tell the difference between a creed and its adherents ? 
  criticising islam does n't mean hating muslims . 
  you are 100 % positive , that all these islamophobes around here are only worked up about the creed and not about it 's adherents ?
