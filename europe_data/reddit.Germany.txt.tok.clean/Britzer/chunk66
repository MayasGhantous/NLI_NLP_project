  [ i am referring you to a lengthy discussion i had with / u/arvinadystopia on the topic of islamophobia . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y8mav/denmark_calls_for_muhammad_cartoons_in_school/cp8kqma ), 
  you will probably never even understand this . 
  a lot of old people do n't understand what is wrong with hating jews or black people . 
  or talking down on them . 
  the third paragraph in the wikipedia article on racism talks about this . 
  a better word is islamophobia . 
  just like antisemitism . 
  but racism is so easy to understand and fits just as well . 
  the underlying motives are the same . 
  apart from this point , islam is not an ideology , but a major religion that includes scriptures , philosophy , a unique history , art , including architecture , a clergy and many followers and interpretations and so much more . 
  for some people islam may also have an ideology . 
  race and religion are surely different . 
  no doubt about that . 
  but the hate of a race and a religion are n't . 
  the similarities of islamophobia and racism are striking , the differences are minuscule . 
  as i made clear in a post before , it does n't matter to a racist if race even exists or not . 
  when you research racism and antisemitism and their motives , you should n't be fooled by what they say . 
  a lot of antisemitists today are pointing their finger at israel , for example , and say they are angry at the settlements and how the jews support israel and the illegal land grabbing . 
  but that is not the reason or motivation behind the antisemitism , but rather the excuse . 
  there is no such thing as a jewish race . 
  this was made up to persecute certain people . 
  the antisemitism in europe is pretty old and complex anyways . 
  islamophobia is quite new . 
  so there is obviously a lot of difference in the culture of these to xenophobic sentiments , but since both a xenophobic sentiments , they obviously have the same underlying causes and motives behind the excuses . 
  i think the jews in the concentration camps did n't really give a damn about the particular excuse for them being put there . 
  if it was them being compared to rats or someone having a problem with their culture or religion . 
  the end result was the same . 
   how muslims have a pattern of doing the things those two people i mentioned do that is racism from your article : * racism and discrimination are wrong as a matter of principle , not of science . 
  that said , it is hard to see anything in the new understanding of race that gives ammunition to racists . 
  the reverse is the case . 
  exploration of the genome has shown that all humans , whatever their race , share the same set of genes . 
  * so if you link to pages that say that racism is wrong , why are you writing racist things ? 
  haters be haters . 
  what is your point ? 
  you take two individuals and say they are cunts . 
  you know who the biggest cunt , currently , is , imho ? 
  are all north koreans cunts , because he is ? 
  all koreans maybe ? 
   pirin\u00e7ci dude , seriously ? 
  that guy ? 
  he is all of the above and more : antisemitist , racist , islamophobe , homophobe , antiziganist , xenophobe when is is n't ragging on muslims , he goes on about gays , women , you name it , he hates them . 
  the guy is a complete idiot . 
  when he spoke yesterday at the pegida event you mentioned , he said that it is unfortunate that the nazi concentration camps are currently not operative . 
  so yea . 
  that guy . 
  you really share his views ? 
  there is no such thing as a ` jewish race ' . 
  nor are there human races anyways . 
  [ race is a social construct . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_%28human_categorization%29 ), 
  anything on why calling anyone anything is a danger to free speech ? 
  for example if i was to call you an idiot , would that be a danger to free speech ? 
   criticism of a religion has nothing to do with race . 
  it is n't a matter of intepretation , it is a matter of fact . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism third paragraph from the top . 
  so what if i was wrong ? 
  who gets to decide that ? 
  calling people names should n't be allowed , because it puts free speech in danger ? 
   calling people racist when they are n't is a tool used widely by some extreme people to discredit others . 
  i do n't know . 
  but that has nothing to do with me . 
  i am neither extreme , nor did i discredit anyone . 
  i simply called something racist that is racist . 
  period . 
  so you think i am wrong . 
  and because i am saying wrong things , that is dangerous to free speech ? 
  please explain . 
  free speech should be limited to things that are ` right ' ? 
  and you decide ? 
  this is going to be ** great ** . 
   see zimbabwe , south-africa ? 
  there 's lots of persecution going around there but i do n't see you raging about that . 
  not to mention zimbabwe practically collapsed after they drove white people away , and even today their agriculture is in very bad shape . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  why do you keep bringing in random stuff ? 
  i do n't see you raging against what russia is doing in ukraine . 
  but how does that even matter in this discussion ? 
   how exactly has europe contributed to far-east situation ? 
  they are doing the fighting among themselves , if they ca n't behave with different shade of islam how can we expect them behave with other religions and cultures ? 
  ok , we are going to stop now . 
  because i have no f-ing clue what you are talking about . 
  indonesia ? 
  india ? 
  where are they fighting ? 
  and what does that have to do with ** anything ** ? 
   no , no it is n't . 
  calling anyone who dares to criticise a religion racist leads to dangerous things where free speech is at danger because of false labels . 
  free speech is a danger to free speech . 
  i love it !, 
   bad things are bad and should be allowed to criticized which is why i called out the racism , when i saw it . 
  yet you seem to disagree and that i should n't call it out , because when i do , bad things happen . 
  is n't that a little hypocritical ? 
  wait for it ... oh yes :  you are hypocrisy incarnate . 
  lulz  and the first thing you do is call them nazis who do criticize them . 
  did i call anyone a nazi ? 
  please refresh my memory . 
  where did i do that ? 
   edit : if you disagree with me you should n't try spamming alts to down vote and instead refute me why i 'm wrong . 
  no way i 'm dropping from +20 up votes to 2 and not a single response .
