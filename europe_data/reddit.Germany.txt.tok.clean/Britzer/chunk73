  we also have luxembourg , where amazon europe is incorporated ( guess why ) and monaco . 
  and other places . 
  as for the british , they govern over some of the really notorious international tax havens like the isle of man or the virgin islands , which they could easily shut down , if they were really interested in closing tax havens instead of simply blowing smoke . 
  though i strongly suspect that most of westminster is inhabited by people that personally own companies in those places , the uk still being very much a class society and governed by old elites . 
  but as shown above , it does n't look like other eu countries are much better . 
  ever heard of the `` double irish arrangement '' ? 
  because currently the irish have a reputation for being the worst offenders . 
  just because i have n't mentioned them yet . 
  i was wrong . 
  i did n't know enough about the tax code . 
  i think i was right about the other thing , though . 
  it 's not about the law , it 's about non-compliance . 
  easy : if you are the only one offering something , you dictate prices ** and ** conditions . 
  the russians are in the business of buying up all of europes gas sources to sell them to europe . 
  they really want to build a pipeline to azerbaijan , for example and buy their gas , instead of the europeans building nabucco . 
  actually they could do a lot , though the question would be , what the effect was . 
  currently they are under pressure from their poor population as well as the european union . 
  though they have not budged to the pressure at all . 
  tax compliance has been absymal at best . 
  they argue that if they start to tax businesses and people , those would leave the country . 
  or make other excuses for them . 
  they have a very richt upper class and a rich upper middle class , who pay almost no taxes . 
  so they could try to raise income . 
  but just like the us has shown , this is very difficult . 
  even if you are in a severe budget crises . 
  but the problem is a little different . 
  in the us , it 's the tax code . 
  in greece the tax code is mostly ok , the problem is comliance with the tax code . 
  and a huge number of people that are on the payroll of the state that make up a bureaucracy that mostly deals in keeping their jobs and making the live of people trying to do private business more difficult . 
  if i apply for a business licence , for example , and have to fill out fifteen forms , people will have to check those forms and file them . 
  and then keep the files . 
  if i only need to fill out one form , i only need very little bureaucracy . 
  so it 's still a war between greek havenots and greek powerful state employees and rich non compliant tax payers . 
  and so far , the havenots have lost every single fight . 
   where did i say this ? 
  high percentage does n't mean overwhelming majority you intellectually dishonest cuntrag . 
  i 'm done with you . 
  accusing a `` high percentage '' ( whatever that means ) is still a very , very sinister move , if you really consider it . 
  not much different than `` majority '' , because it is such a heinous accusation ( supporting homosexual genocide ) . 
  also it is as baseless as any accusation leveled against homosexuals in the past , which makes is so curious that you are doing that . 
  i guess it takes one to know one ? 
   i 'm not in any camp may i remind you ? 
     what if they actually are after me ? 
  muslims , even european ones , are some of the most anti-gay people on earth and an insane percentage of them believe that homosexuality ( and apostasy ) should be punished by death . 
    when a huge percentage of a group , even in developed countries , believes that you should be killed i 'd say that qualifies as being `` out to get me '' you just posted huge amounts of islamophobic racist bullshit . 
  that automatically puts you in a camp . 
  you are islamophobic . 
  you are in that camp . 
  the camp that supports deportation of people . 
  the hate camp . 
  and as soon as they grow tired of hating muslims , who do you think they will hate nex ? 
  and you called me a moron . 
  dude , just give up . 
  you are digging and digging and digging yourself deeper into the racist bullshit hole . 
  you basically said that the overwhelming majority of muslims support genocide against homosexuals . 
  which is about as outrageous as claiming that the pope supports genocide against homosexuals . 
  how about if you go to fraco 's grave and ask the guards those questions . 
  i suppose they have some answers for you . 
  i guess that puts you in the same camp as `` dem muslims '' . 
  or what did franco had to say about homos ? 
  over here in germany they were put in death camps along with the jews . 
  but people did n't talk about it and still do n't , because you know what ? 
  homos are still not fully accepted . 
  i am not sure what you are getting at , but the islamophobic crowd would be the last place i would put a homosexual looking for support . 
  then again , modern times makes for strange bedfellas and it would n't be the first huge stretch that fringe politics has seen . 
  and it certainly would n't be the last . 
  really ? 
  i am the moron here ? 
  well , better be a moron that a freightened little chicken that votes nazis into office , because `` dem muslim is out to get me '' . 
  reddit outage , i noticed . 
  i was wondering about the crazy deletion . 
  technical problems make much more sense , especially considering the amazon problems . 
  that 's what i am telling you . 
  hide yo wife , hide yo kides , dem muslims are going around the neighbourhood killing everyone that is not muslim . 
  ** and you are next ** maybe we should kill them first , before they kill us . 
  or simply deport them all . 
  would n't that be just so humane ? 
  so european of us , to deport them even though they want to kill us ? 
  yea , i know , you will call me soft , but we do have our values , do n't we ? 
  my stuff was deleted as well . 
  and i was strongly argueing against islamophobia . 
  and when one idiot answered that they ( dem muslims want to hurt , yadda , yadda ) were out to get him , i even mocked the guy , because i could n't figure out an honest answer to the racist mofo . 
  and now all of my comments form that thread are deleted . 
   should i not be afraid of islam ? 
  what is there to be happy about in it ? 
   why would i want to tolerate those who do not tolerate my way of life ? 
  dude , you should really be more careful , because they are after you . 
  they will read this message , come to your house and rape you . 
  i am serious . 
  get your guns ready !, 
  they could already be at your gate . 
   at what point does tolerance of intolerance i think that is the current mantra of islamophobia : tolerance of intolerance leads to intolerance . 
  which , in theory , makes sense . 
  and i am way too apathic towards this subreddit at this point to explain for another time why this is bullshit in reality . 
  sounds great , though . 
  i will give 'em that . 
  [ edit  which reminds me to unsubscribe . 
  haters gon na hate . 
  and if you really want to hate on this subreddit , i stopped giving a shit . 
  please someone remove the europe flag on the way out , because it stands for values .
