  then you simply kill all the ones with a score set above a certain threshhold . 
  though killing them would be inefficient . 
  maybe torture them first and ask them to finger other muslim fanatics ? 
   try to send one of your female relatives to a muslim country in a miniskirt . 
  try to send one of your female relatives to hungary topless ? 
   what about public nudity ? 
  it can not be legal . 
  why ? 
  / r/europe is giving muslism so much crap about their standards of clothing , is n't it hypocrital to then turn around and make such a fuss about people disregarding european standards of clothing ? 
  either you respect different attitudes towards morality and apparel , or you do n't . 
  saying one ( ours ) is surperior to the other ( theirs , be it public nudity or public niqab ) is dishonest , do n't you think ? 
  while this may have effects on the us-uk relationship , i interpret this as a reaction to what blair did in 2003 , which is still a huge deal in the uk . 
   but the islamic realm has never outlawed polygamy ... because it is written into the theology . 
  this is one of the many profound religious/cultural difference between the christian west and islam ... differences you keep insisting do n't exist , all evidence to the contrary . 
  ok : people are different . 
  cultures are different . 
  the us and europe have very different coultures , even though they look similar on the outside . 
  through cultural imperialism / globalization by hollywood and the us music industry as well as gaming and now smartphone industry the us culture and the values behind it , for better or for worse , invade and conquor the world . 
  i do n't think it is possible to underestimate the profund influence that american icons like coca cola , hollywood , google , facebook , twitter , microsoft , american music ( hip hop , for example ) have upon the world . 
  and i am going to be very clear here : personally i feel our values are surperior . 
  from voltaire to thomas jefferson , personal freedom rules , imho . 
  the needs of the few , the needs of the individual actually outweigh the needs of the many . 
  but there is a catch : respect for personal freedom also means that you need to respect someones right to wear a burqa or a niqab . 
  you ca n't force someone to be free . 
  if you give them the right to choose , you have to respect their choice . 
  our values dictate that we must let those that want to be repressed continue to do so . 
  we can only offer them support . 
  if we want to stay true to our values , we must respect them . 
  which is why the us is wrong in using torture . 
  you are wrong in using drones . 
  no punishment without due process . 
  what values do we try to defend , if we do n't respect them ourselves ? 
  that is my creed . 
  a lot of those that ostracize islam have a similar mindset to the very things ( intolerance , oppression ) they pretend to fight . 
  the similarities in closed mindness of religious fundamentalist , be it christian or muslim and islamophobic people are profound . 
  they have more in common with each other than with more open and tolerant people . 
  be it muslim , christian , atheist or whatever . 
  i see similarities and differences elsewhere . 
  and i have talked to religious people . 
  not many really know a lot about theology . 
  they observe the rituals and like being part of a community . 
  in that they are very similar , no matter what the name of said religion is . 
  people are different . 
  a japanese person will be very different from a european as well as a somali nomad will be very different from a modern citizen of islamabad . 
   no , mormonism is at fault . 
  polygamy is a theological particular of mormonism , just as it is islam . 
  fortunately , 1 ) the mormon church officially banned polygamy , though some break-away sects still practice it ... and 2 ) in the usa , polygamy is illegal . 
   but the islamic realm has never outlawed polygamy ... because it is written into the theology . 
  this is one of the many profound religious/cultural difference between the christian west and islam ... differences you keep insisting do n't exist , all evidence to the contrary . 
  times change . 
  you wo n't find much polygamy in modern islamic areas like the capitals of most islamic nations . 
  except for the `` breakaway-sects '' or whatever you want to call it . 
  polygamy is also written into christian theology , btw . 
  but in both cases , islam as well as christianity , modern interpretations outlaw it with some little tricks . 
  and again , we are talking about some singular issue . 
  if i discredit it , you will just come up with another and another . 
  as i said , i can do the same for blacks or mexicans . 
  it does n't lead this discussion anywhere . 
  why do you keep doing it then ? 
  you have not put one single argument forward why islam is bad itself . 
  what the difference is between muhammed and david growing up in detroit and going to high school and sunday/friday school . 
   only a vapid , lazy intellect would insist that there are no differences between peoples and cultures . 
  i did write a little about different cultures up above . 
  and i do think our values are better than the chinese system of putting the welfare of the community ahead of the welfare of the individual . 
  but i do respect people when they have a different opinion on that . 
  after all , that is part of the value system i believe in . 
  everyone has a right to their own opinion . 
   you , on the other hand , are in total denial about the social pathologies among muslim immigrants in your country . 
  ok , now we are talking . 
  yes , i am publicly in denial about that . 
  mainly because when we talk about social pathologies among immigrants , the racists come and talk . 
  [ check out this thread from today . ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1lbc9e/since_romania_and_bulgaria_joined_the_eu_in_2007/ ) . 
  if you had that ** every ** ** single ** ** time ** when you talked about immigrants , would n't you also get tired and resentful ? 
  i told you that europe is far more racist than the us . 
  if you check out the comment section of / r/europe , you will find racist shit upvoted to the max in every single thread concerning immigration . 
  yes , there are problems associated with immigration . 
  like in any country . 
  though it is very limited compared to the scale of immigration itself . 
  most immigrants do n't make much of a problem . 
  but xenophobia is rampant . 
  especially now that europe has economic problems . 
  just look at greece and the success of the fascist party . 
  yes i am very loath to discuss the problems of immigration in germany . 
  you ca n't talk about it without some dipshit xenophobic joining in . 
  and even though i am on the american side , when it comes to censorship , i am sometimes glad we live in europe , where censorship is much more common . 
  they cut out a lot of the crap . 
  yes , i think it is bad overall , but it does sometimes have advantages . 
  people here are also not used to having no censorship at all . 
   but my friend , branding your interlocutor as a racist is a form of censorship ... in america and europe , stigmatizing one 's opponent as a racist is a time-tested mechanism to destroy their reputation and in the process , ostracize them from society at-large which , in effect , silences their voice ... ( i realize this does n't apply to reddit , but it would certainly apply to a conversation you might have with one of your countrymen who might agree with me on the issues ) . 
  ahh , do n't be such a chicken . 
  i called you out on your xenophobia concerning muslims . 
  and i still think i am right . 
  you do have a problem with your islamophobia . 
  you can justify it all you want . 
  and we will probabely still be discussing this ten years from now . 
  edit , cause i forgot :  non-muslims are required to observe islamic dress and customs when they reside in or visit the muslim realm . 
  is there anything wrong with the expectation of reciprocity , that muslims do the same in the non-muslim world ? 
  this is partly wrong , as a guest you do n't have to observe every islamic custom and dress , when you visit a muslim realm and partly a different morality standard . 
  you have to cover up , when you want to go to the vatican as well . 
  long trousers , long shirts .
