  nothing more , yet nothing less . 
  medical procedures bear risks . 
  but parents have the custody . 
  they have tradition and billions of cases and thousands of years of experience of this being a perfectly save and harmless thing to do on their side . 
  i personally think it 's wrong . 
  but i am not even sure it should be regulated by law . 
  because i do n't like the consequences . 
  i do n't like alcohol . 
  it kills many more kids ( violent adults , pregnant mothers , duis , ... ) than circumcision by far . 
  yet i do n't advocate for prohibition . 
  we all know why . 
  horrible crime or whatever . 
  please do n't compare it with fgm . 
  any murder is wrong . 
  you still would n't compare it to the holocaust . 
  billions of men live fine with circumcised penises . 
  the same ca n't be said for victims of fgm . 
  it 's not a stretch , they simply do n't play in the same ballpark . 
  muslims and jews lie . 
  that 's what they do . 
  hitler yea !!!!, 
  omg we must protect christina europe frim da bad muslims !!!, 
  ! 1111oneoneone you people make me sick, 
  please consider that the clitoris is ** the ** stimulation nerve center , where everything comes together . 
  like the whole penis for the male . 
  so cutting a part of the clitoris is akin to cutting a part of the penis itself . 
  ** not ** the foreskin . 
  so many people keep comparing fgm with male circumcision in their hysteria about the latter , when they are still ** not ** the same by any standard . 
  no matter what `` type '' is involved . 
  even scraping the clitoris would be akin to scraping the whole penis . 
  the clitoris is much smaller , after all . 
  but i would not make all those comparisons in the first place , since they are just horribly wrong . 
  fighting against an unneeded medical procedure is one thing . 
  but by comparing said procedure to a horrible crime against women only takes away from the cause by making you sound like a lunatic . 
  you do n't need to defend something that never happened ( left side ) . 
  also what do these isolated cases have in common ? 
  nothing !, 
  only some breivik wannabe called [ fodtp ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/fodtp ) glued them together to incite racial hatred . 
  wow , what a racist thing to post . 
  anyone that disputes that this is a post designed to incite racial hatred is either a total idiot or can go fuck themselves . 
  downvote me all you want . 
  wtf is up in / r/europe anyways ? 
  i was just called hitler for implying that romania and bulgaria were admitted to the eu too early . 
  now we get this racist mofo bullshit . 
  that 's what you get for letting bulgaria and romania into the union . 
  bulgarians and romanians tell me that , btw . 
  they have big problems with their respective economies and democracies and we should have let them have enough time to sort them out . 
  similar to greece being let into the euro zone . 
  [ edit  maybe some of the downvotes come , because people think i am against romanians , bulgarians or berry pickers . 
  i am not . 
  they can come and pick berries wherever they like . 
  all i am saying is that we should have waited a bit before letting them join the european union . 
  their corrupt government elite should have been replaced before . 
  most of you probabely know , but the maastricht level has no other reason behind it than that they took a look at the uk , france and germany and added a couple percentage points for safety at the time those criteria were written . 
  it 's pretty arbitrary . 
  there is a real reason behind this . 
  and that is that they do n't want countries to generate too much debt . 
  great social mobility is how it ought to be . 
  because the american way is the self reliant , self determined , master of you luck way . 
  currently things are a bit different . 
  two things though : a lot of americans want to change that , they are just fighting about the how ( mandatory health care is a good example ) and also social mobility is still a lot better in the us compared to 100 years ago . 
  because the supreme court ( and anyone educated enough ) knows that everything is subject to change . 
  it 's not 1790 or 1890 anymore . 
  so the constitution has to be adapted . 
  what you are describing sounds like a very reasonable concept . 
  after all , that is how democracy is supposed to work . 
  our lawbooks are , at least in a big part , an expression of how the overwhelming majority wants them to be . 
  whatever the answer may be , americans strongly believe in self determination . 
  and that any government should allow for a maximum self determined lifestyle . 
  so there is a correlation between strict gun laws and killing sprees ? 
  it 's not told to them , but at the core of their believe system . 
  that 's how they view the world . 
  i do n't think it 's a matter of right or wrong . 
  the more choices you have , the unhappier you can become . 
  can , not must . 
  i do n't know about eloquency . 
  it 's just something i kinda picked up on while i spent a year in california in high school during the 90s . 
  i was looking for the reasons why my peers were viewing things different from the way i was . 
  i never fully understood it until at least a year later . 
  thx !, 
  well , as far as i see the americans , i think the self reliance/responsibility thing is at the core of their believe system . 
  that is how they see themselves . 
  and how a country `` should be '' . 
  and afaik , they also have a problem with the lack of social mobility and try and change it . 
  mainly through improving their public school system , which is always a huge factor during elections . 
  but so far they discovered there is no easy way to enhance education . 
  even the gates foundation had to admit that their preferred solution led nowhere and made a complete u-turn a couple years ago . 
  that 200 year old piece of paper is their constitution . 
  that thing is like the bible to americans . 
  they fought against the british to have it . 
  other countries do n't value their constitution as much . 
  then they have other hangups respective to their history . 
  ask french people about the principles of the french revolution and if they are just 200 year old hogwash and they will tell you something . 
  it has two sides to it . 
  less organized social strife can be one . 
  but do n't forget , the us had strong unions , too in the last century . 
  so it 's not all the easy to dismiss . 
  except that humans have free will and all , do n't they ? 
  look , i am not advocating for one or the other . 
  i just do n't think there is a right answer for this question .
