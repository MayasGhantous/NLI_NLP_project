  arms coverd , legs covered . 
  same if you were to visit the amish people . 
  imagine coming from a place where it is ok to be naked . 
  what would americans say if you let out your shlong in the middle of new york ? 
  so muslims have a different feeling towards morality . 
  why is that so strange to you , as an american . 
  americans are known to be more uptight than europeans . 
  less uptight , of course , than saudis , but somewhere in the middle . 
  no boobs on tv in the us , for example . 
   the actions of latin immigrants participating in gangs is a social pathology ... and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the dictates of their religion . 
  the actions of muslim immigrants , insofar as honor crimes , fgm , child-marriage , polygamy and even their motivations for terrorism , is related to the dictates of their religion . 
  your unwillingness to accept this does n't change the fact . 
  why do you think so ? 
  why are you sure that latino gangs are n't led astray by their religion , yet muslims are n't ? 
  you were so quick to say that german immigrants must have problems , because of their religion . 
  but americans immigrants have other reasons . 
   yes , but the problem persists only in muslim-majority countries and again again again . 
  i am the idiot for even engaging this discussion . 
  polygamy exists in utah for cryin out loud . 
  but islam is at fault , right ? 
  every ** single ** thing . 
  i have to refute every singe issue . 
  problem kids ? 
  must be islam . 
  with mexican gangs ( way worse problems , btw . ), 
  it must be something else . 
  must be islam . 
  utah does n't count . 
  that is , what i tried to explain to you . 
  when you see someone doing something bad and that person is a muslim , islam must be the reason . 
  if you see someone doing something bad and they are not muslim , something else must be the reason . 
  so islam is responsible for everything bad a muslim does . 
  and when you see any muslim , you automatically assume the worst about that person . 
  while it is not racism per se , it is a very similar attitude . 
   and apparently , you do n't feel that this `` blending '' has been any factor in the perpetuation of this phenomenon . 
  i beg to differ . 
  i suspect without the religious component , it would be much less prevalent than it is . 
  old customs often die out in the face of modernity , particularly barbaric ones . 
  why does fgm linger on so stubbornly ? 
  quite obviously because of the religious component . 
  modernity ? 
  we were talking about somali nomads . 
  you are making arguments against yourself . 
   any context ? 
  had i distinguished `` us '' from `` them '' in a manner that was favorable to `` them '' , you would have had absolutely no problem with it . 
  it is problematic only in the context of a society so racially over-sensitive that the atmospherics have taken on pathological proportions . 
  legitimate inquiry and scrutiny into islamic teachings and culture is routinely branded in hysterical tones as `` racist '' ... as has been so evident in this discourse of ours . 
  it is the basic xenophobic sentiment . 
  * they * are different . 
  * they * do n't conform to your ideas of how people should behave or dress . 
  you also make a distinction between two groups . 
  * us * and * them * . 
  and they are something you possibly fear . 
  if you read up racism and xenophobia , you will find that this is actually the basic sentiment for all the xenophobias . 
  be it anti semitism , racism , islamophobia , and so on and so forth . 
   many do . 
  many do n't . 
  if you are arguing that there are no problems regarding muslim integration into europe , you are oblivious to reality . 
  are we now talking about percentages ? 
  how many blacks are bad fathers ? 
  how many blacks live on welfare ? 
  how many latinos are illegal ? 
  are we going to blame their color of skin ? 
  are we going to blame mexicans in general ? 
    `` i disapprove of what you say , but i will defend to the death your right to say it ''  on the contrary , you would demonize me as a `` racist '' . 
  i very much disapprove of what you say , yet i would never call to censor you . 
  quite the contrary . 
  i even engage in a discussion with you , ecouraging you to talk more . 
  that is the opposite of censoring you . 
  same with clothing . 
  i very much disapprove of the niqab or , even worse , the burqa . 
  but i do n't think a legal ban is much help . 
  which is why i posted this funny video with the surgical mask . 
   latino gangs do exist in america ... and here , we acknowledge their existence as a major social pathology . 
  and the reason is because they are christian ? 
  or muslim ? 
   the specificity of islamic theology and how it influences the behavior of muslims is a reality . 
  i hope someday you can come to terms . 
  how exactly does the specificity of christian theology ( love thy enemy , do n't cheat , rich people do n't get into heaven , etc. ), 
  influence the behavior of christians , expecially in the us ? 
  yes , theology can be an influence . 
  among other stuff . 
  but i would count it as minor . 
  on the topic of fgm : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation#reasons_for_the_practice http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religious_views_on_female_genital_mutilation it ** predates ** islam . 
  just as i thought ( i was n't sure ) . 
  it is a cultural thing that was integrated into islam when it came into the region . 
  and , if you read the article carefully , the islamic scholars are divided over it . 
  but it does n't matter what islam says . 
  people would do it anyways . 
  so islam integrates it in order to blend into local culture . 
  both christianity and islam have done this over the centuries . 
  so now we have fgm done . 
  you are going to come with a different issue , are n't you ? 
  about the racist thing . 
  coming in to this discussion you stated this one :  why ca n't they take the same accommodating attitude about our culture ? 
  in almost any context , this is regarded as a very racist thing . 
  why ca n't ** they ** ( evil outsiders ) behave themselves ? 
  first of all , who are ** they ** ? 
  because , when it comes to muslims ( or blacks , or mexicans ) , many already live integrated . 
  but you apply that to the whole group .
