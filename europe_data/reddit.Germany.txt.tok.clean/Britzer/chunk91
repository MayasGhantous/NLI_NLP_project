  because that is part of being german . 
  seeing people of a different race as foreign . 
  i know a columbian woman who was adopted as a toddler by a german family and never saw columbia again . 
  not even she considers herself 100 % german . 
  because she looks in the mirror and , being german , sees a foreigner . 
  that is how deeply ingrained non-integration is into our culture . 
  but back to your statement about people needing generations instead of a couple years to integrate : do you have any evidence of this ? 
  granted , i only have circumstancial evidence , but a lot of it . 
  and being german myself it never ceases to amaze me , because it does n't follow conventional wisdom . 
  just for kicks i started reading the comments below the article . 
  there are four comments atm . 
  two very racist comments and two comments written by one person that are anti-racist . 
  all seemingly coming from norwegians . 
  that would currently be a two thirds majority of norwegians proudly proclaiming their racism in english for all the world to see . 
  ok , now are we talking about the individual who committed arson , possibly for political reasosn ? 
  because most of the people in this thread very much seem to talk about the millions of muslims that live in europe . 
  also leaving a country would not occur to people who would go to those extremes to further their agenda . 
  someone who is committing arson does n't think along the lines of `` oh , gosh , i do n't like the freedom of the society i live in . 
  '' , but rather along the lines of `` someone did something i do n't like , i will destroy them no matter where they live . '', 
  this is not tied to geography . 
  an arsonist belongs in prison . 
  i just tried to put things in perspective , because people in this thread were collectively shitting their pants that europe was under attack . 
  it 's not . 
  i am sorry i got you wrong . 
  [ nobeastsofierce just pointed out that by ` them ' you specifically meant the individuum that carried out the arson and the individuum that defaced said webpage instead of any larger group such as muslims ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lxfzl/french_satirical_magazine_charlie_hebdo_have_been/c2wm1dh ) . 
  that is an important distinction . 
  but i am certainly not the only one that got this wrong by a couple million people . 
  just have a look a [ daevas 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lxfzl/french_satirical_magazine_charlie_hebdo_have_been/c2wjru5 ) last comment . 
  this is just one example in a very , very racist thread . 
  and that 's what i was commenting on early on . 
  and that is the reason i call [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lxfzl/french_satirical_magazine_charlie_hebdo_have_been/c2wjfw6 ) by you racist as well * persons who find european freedoms such as ; freedom of speech , sex equality and freedom of religion somehow wrong , should seriously ask themselves why they live there * , because it implies that you mean a larger group of people . 
  like all muslims , but are simply not saying it . 
  for pc reasons . 
  that 's the thin veil i was talking about . 
  and again , i am certainly not the only one who gets things like this wrong . 
  that 's why you should n't make such statements in a racist thread like this one . 
  it is all about context . 
  ( same with the ` white agenda ' comment that was all about context ), 
   he was talking about the people who carried out bombings . 
  you somehow extended this to all muslims . 
  if lewisbell was only talking about the handful people that carried out the bombings i guess i really misunderstood him . 
  but i am not sure this is the case . 
  and i am certainly not the only one in this thread that thinks like i do . 
  just have a look at [ daevas 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lxfzl/french_satirical_magazine_charlie_hebdo_have_been/c2wjru5 ) in this thread . 
  without skipping a beat he means ** all ** muslims . 
  and that 's what i was getting at . 
  and that 's why i said early on that arsonists belong in prison . 
  my first comment was , however , [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lxfzl/french_satirical_magazine_charlie_hebdo_have_been/c2wfls9 ) about taming down the racism in this whole thread . 
  that is spot on . 
   racist : `` arabs are not european , and are backwards ignorant people they should be kicked out '' not racist : `` persons who find european freedoms such as ; freedom of speech , sex equality and freedom of religion somehow wrong , should seriously ask themselves why they live there '' that 's called ` thinly veiled racism ' . 
  i could explain . 
  but i seriously doubt that you would want to understand that . 
  you also do n't get the concept of freedom of speech . 
  if i ca n't say something is wrong ( whatever it is ) , than i do n't have freedom of speech . 
  just because i decide that what is wrong is said freedom , i do n't suddenly lose said freedom . 
  otherwise i never had it . 
  what do we tell people that protest the military ? 
  after all they defend our freedom of speech . 
  ca n't those people protest ? 
  what about the government ? 
  it was democratically elected . 
  i could go on , but again , i doubt that you would want to understand any of this . 
  relevant in us politics , regarding herman cain especially . 
  read up on the topic and come back in 24 hours . 
  in some countries racist violence is so commonplace , that it is n't even reported anymore . 
  in germany we have about 1000 violent acts by right wing extremists every year . 
  that 's about three per day . 
  if we extrapolate that to the eu ( german population 90 million , eu population 500 million ) we get about 15 violent acts committed by right wing extremists for political reasons within the eu per day . 
  but i would wager that countries that have a [ big problem with gypsys ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,788868,00.html ) have higher numbers and much more brutal instances than the german average . 
  and those are christians . 
  now are all christian europeans violent thugs that beat up immigrants ? 
  if we follow your logic , yes they are !, 
   you really do n't understand racism do you ? 
  you tell me . 
  absolutetly no racist vibe [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/lxfzl/french_satirical_magazine_charlie_hebdo_have_been/ ) ? 
   i hope they do go to prison , but before the arsonists decided to do it maybe they could have asked themselves , `` maybe a free society just is n't for me '' well , replace arsonitst with racists and free society with reddit and you got me . 
  well , unlike the multiple racist beatings all over europe every week . 
  but for some reason nobody calls all christians terrorists because of that . 
   again with putting words in my mouth . 
  totally . 
  you are such a muslim lover . 
   i said that ` people ' that can not peacefully coexist with pluralist society should find a place that is more suited to their ideology , i did not say ` go home ' at all . 
  what does that have to do with arson ? 
  people that commit arson need to go to prison . 
   so yeah , fuck you a healthy * fuck you * back to you , you motherfucking racist !!, 
   do n't accuse people of racism until you can back it up btw . 
  i did n't directly accuse you of being a racist in my last comment , did n't i ? 
  so much for putting words into people 's mouths . 
  but you read my comment right . 
  you are a racist . 
  because i read your comment right . 
  and found out . 
  that 's how it works . 
  you can sense someone is racist by reading their shit , even if they do n't outright say they are racist . 
  just like you picked up on what i meant . 
  all muslims are therefore terrorists . 
  or what ? 
  that is why i asked you to tame done the motherf * cking racism . 
  get it ? 
  i responded to your comment , because it was the most upvoted one in the threat , but almost all the comments are racist such as your .
