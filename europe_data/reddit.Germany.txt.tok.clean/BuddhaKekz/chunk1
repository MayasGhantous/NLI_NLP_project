well not in my case . 
  i study ancient history , so i actually get to use my latin sometimes . 
  though i usually take one of the readily available translations . 
  it just saves a lot of time and work , atleast when the exact wording is not important for the argument . 
  6\u00a01/2 years here you filthy casuals . 
  mostly because my homestate only has half a school year for the 13th grade .

  [ are you discriminating german opas ?

  [ but every country is founded as that . 
  also you are saying germany was not founded as country of germans ? 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/993/875/084.png ), 
  you know that `` stan '' is just persian for `` country '' or `` home of '' . 
  `` germanistan '' just means country or home of the germans . 
  so pretty much what the country has been since it was founded . 
  if they are born here they are n't migrants ... 
  unless blowing up is a new euphemism for getting shitfaced , no . 
  [ palatine german . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palatine_german_language ) in my case the vorderpf\u00e4lzisch variation . 
  my dialect 's equivalent would be `` alla '' . 
  you can use it in pretty much every situation the guy acted out too . 
  at this point that can only be an improvement . 
  germany would have to lose against turkey first , so it might take a while until we can annex this bit . 
   sky is also rather grey . 
  all the leaves are brown and the sky is grey ... 
  wow the merkel imitiation was really good , sounded almost exactly like her . 
  i 'm sure you can always ask your bros to help you out in a situation of dire need . 
   ( definitely on international steak and bj day ) dude ... it 's schniblo-tag !, 
  ( schnitzel and bj day ) that 's today btw . 
   hand it off to the tender embrace of the germans , to wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , who is the leading advocate of austerity in the eu , the greeks could tell some nice stories about him . 
  i do n't see how sch\u00e4uble factors at all into this . 
  the referendum will not be held until 2018 , while there is a good chance that merkel loses the elections to schulz . 
  if schulz wins , he will not pick sch\u00e4uble as his minister of finance , even when the cdu would be their coalition partner . 
  there views on austerity are pretty much the opposite . 
  but let 's say merkel gets another term and sch\u00e4uble stays in office . 
  before scottland can adapt they euro they first have to leave the uk and then fulfill the economic prerequisites for it . 
  until they are ready for that years can pass . 
  during that time they either have to keep using the pound or get their own currency ( which i think is unlikely ) . 
  considering sch\u00e4uble 's advanced age , he should n't even be an issue anymore when scotland is ready for the euro . 
  they only open variable is his successor who may just continue his policy . 
  but again , that will only happen if merkel wins the next election ( or even the next one after that , depending on how long it takes scotland to get ready . ), 
  kind of , the alemanni were a confederation , not a single tribe . 
  so the name refers to that . 
  basically all the tribes banned together so they are `` all the men '' . 
  in truth it was n't all the tribes of course , but do n't let facts get in the way of a cool name !, 
  `` germani '' actually makes sense as an old germanic word meaning `` spear people '' . 
  but i do n't think it 's the origin of the word , it 's probably just coincidence , since the germanic tribes never gave themselves a name as a whole . 
  because it only got that name in the 12th century , about 150 years after the date of this map . 
  calling `` roman empire '' would have been more accurate than just `` the empire '' though . 
  i guess they renamed it to avoid confusion with the ancient roman empire . 
  same reason the eastern part is called `` byzantine empire '' . 
  they were never called as such during their existance , that 's a modern name .

  the truth hurts sometimes .

  he claimed in an interview he wants to lead both wings of the spd , that means he will try to implement ideas from both sides . 
  on top of that , everything he said so far in public appearance has been notably more left from previous statements of the spd leadership . 
  not left wing , but still more to the left . 
  nixon was a republican and a rather right wing one too , yet he was the first american president that went to china . 
  mao 's china , so a communist regime , that was arguably even more left than the ussr at the time . 
  however , since nixon was known as `` anti-communist '' , he could go to china without being branded as a `` commie-lover '' .

  oregon , the pacific north-west , huh ? 
  i can live with that . 
  portland seems like a nice place to visit . 
   there is a large number of german-style buildings in qingdao city centre , remarkable considering the german colonial period only lasted 16 years ( 1898 -- 1914 ) . 
  the unique combination of german and chinese architecture in the city centre , combined with german demographic roots and a large korean expatriate population , gives qingdao a distinct atmosphere .

  he already ate it , of course . 
  i think they deserve it . 
  well then it is time to learn geography now !, 
  saying attila was hungarian is a bit of a stretch . 
  the center of the hunnic empire was modern day hungary , but that is about as much as they have to do with the magyars . 
  the hunns ruled the area in the 5th century , magyars conquered it in the 9th .
