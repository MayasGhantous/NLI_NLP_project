  do n't worry we know you are just jealous . 
  i do n't think they are more different , they are just the only ones with political representation , thus their culture ist more easily broadcast . 
  i would say all of germany . 
  there is no place in germany you can point to and say `` this is germany '' . 
  instead germany is a combination of regions with very distinct cultures . 
  i 'm sure italians can relate . 
  the elwetritsch !, 
  currently in brazil , they do it and i absolutely hate it . 
  atleast its just the women , the men accept my handshakes . 
  though this often results in the squeeze hug-handshake . 
  still less awkward than the cheek kissing . 
  i do n't understand why beer ( or alcohol in general ) is so popular , it tastes horrible . 
  coffee too , yuck . 
  different people , different tastes i guess . 
  i 'm on vacation in brazil and have to use my phone to surf the internet . 
  i wish i had my pc with me . 
  we had clubs in elemantary but after that only sport activities in highschool . 
  we did n't have a school paper . 
  maybe they were just flirting . 
  maybe they thought they get something out of it . 
  it 's really hard to say not knowing the two . 
  as a pf\u00e4lzer i can honestly say i hate all my neighbouring regions . 
  especially you saarland . 
  yeah muslims are the new enemy of the alt-right . 
  since poland is also against muslim migration they are allies now . 
  i knew the estonia thing from `` scandinavia and the world '' , a pretty good webcomic . 
  it also introduced me to a lot of other nordic injokes . 
  run around in my pyjamas all day and not close the door while taking a leak [ like homer .

  username checks out . 
  we have a lot of turkish slang , like babo ( originally from bosnian * father * but used as * boss * ) , ha siktir ( means * shit * or * fuck * , popularized by a german gag dub of lord of the rings ) and lan ( means * buddy * or * dude * ) . 
  the golden age of dank memes . 
  also known as the dankest timeline . 
  maybe , i 'm from one of the shum towns and i 've been jokingly called out on `` jewing around '' when i was being stingy again . 
  it was in the privacy of my friends home though , would n't do that around strangers . 
  does having a degree in history count as a scientist ? 
  [ you 'd be surprised . 
  ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l5s8kdwyq81qc03fuo1_500.jpg ), 
  well as i said in similar threads in the past , our history lessons in school really focus on europe , germany and to a lesser degree france in particular . 
  india was mentioned on the topic of colonialism , but it was really just a footnote . 
  i see others talking about alexander reaching india , we did not even talk about that in my school , much to my personal annoyance as ancient history is my favorite era . 
  antiquity in my school was athenic democracy and how the roman aristocracy worked . 
  then rome fell and that was it . 
  man , i hate how rushed and limited our history classes were just so we can focus an entire year on the nazis . 
  tell everyone the story how your great-great-great-grand-aunt once petted an alsatian and how you are so connected with your german roots because you like beer and wear lederhosen . 
  also call women you meet `` leibchen '' and `` fraulein '' . 
  and last but not least , tell all your new german friends that you forgive them for screwing up in the 30 's and 40 's and that they should n't be so hard on themselves . 
  `` just let it go . '', 
  any wine from the palatinate is the best you can get from germany ( do n't believe badeners ' lies ) . 
  riesling , silvaner , wei\u00df burgunder for white wine and dornfelder , blauer portugieser , sp\u00e4tburgunder for red wine . 
  ca n't give any personal recommencation , i do n't drink alcohol and am actually allergic to wine . 
  [ a what ? 
  j. . o. . . k. . . e. . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbaijg5betw ), 
  he is from serbia in case you ca n't tell by the flair . 
  vu\u010di\u0107 ( their president and former pm ) has similar ambitions than the sultan , he 's just less noisy about it . 
  probably also because unlike erdolf , he has n't given up on eu-membership yet . 
  yeah same here , my father cooks most of the time , because he is retired and has the time to do it . 
  much to his annoyance , he really dislikes cooking . 
  though so does everyone else in the family , even my mother hated it , despite being so good at it . 
  i can get why people might like it , but to me it 's just a chore . 
  on the other hand , i 'd rather deal with it than go out or eat fast food all the time . 
  especially since our home cooking is so good . 
  then i 'm going to be in the same area . 
  did n't call them but went to their station to report that my bike was stolen . 
  they said they will look for it , but bike theft was such a common crime here , that i should n't get my hopes up they find it . 
  well i actually found the bike myself the next day , only the front wheel was missing . 
  turns out the thief actually wanted my neighbors bike but could n't get through the lock , so removed the front wheel from that bike and replaced it with mine . 
  he did n't need the rest of my bike , so he left it on the street . 
  that actually led the police to him . 
  he was n't very bright . 
  the next year he returned for revenge . 
  i think he forgot where he stole the bike so he just went and cut the tires of all cars in the shared underground garage . 
  all tires ? 
  not ours in fact , since my father installed a security camera after the bike theft . 
  the thief/tire slasher noticed the cam and booked it . 
  you can see him contemplating his life choices for 2 seconds on the footage before he ran . 
  unfortunately we are the second to last parking space in the row , so he already went through 8 cars by that point . 
  anyway the footage led to him again . 
  sweet justice was served . 
  oh and the reputation of german police in general is good , atleast in my region and hometown . 
  they are just seen as a little uneffective some times , though mostly to being understaffed ( thanks sch\u00e4uble ... ) . 
  almost everyday . 
  my father , brother and i alternate in the duty , since my mother passed away . 
  before that it was exclusively her doing all the cooking and she was damn good at it . 
  atleast we have most of her recipes , so every meal is like a little token of memory . 
  that was post was more sentimental than you would have expected , right ? 
  we read an excerpt of a walther von der vogelweide poem , i do n't remember which one though . 
  so something from the end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century . 
  which area/city are your relatives from , if i may ask ? 
  i have been in africa ( egypt , tunesia , algeria ) and south america ( brazil & paraguay ) quite a few times . 
  in fact later this week i will travel to brazil again to visit my relatives . 
  [ hellenistic art . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenistic_art ) it continues the great tradition from the classical period , while adding elements from asian and african cultures and was the template for roman and renaissance art . 
  [ i ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_synchron ) [ disagree . 
  ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/brandtfilm ) there are quite a few movies and tv shows that are straight up better in the german dub . 
   just please stop beating us at football ca n't make promises we ca n't keep . 
  i had a lecture in my first semester studying archeology ( changed it to history later ) about the diplomatic ties between the bronze age kingdoms . 
  my favorite part was about a letter send by a king in modern day israel to the pharaoh `` we thank you for your gift , but when melting it down we noticed it was n't pure gold , but 2/3s silver instead . 
  please send pure gold next time , oh wise pharaoh ! '', 
  i loved that he was demanding and subjecting himself at the same time .
