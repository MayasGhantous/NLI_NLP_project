  the videos about germany are usually people saying `` yes it is exactly like this hahahahaha !, 
  i 'm from germany btw !, 
  make a video about [ insert german place/object/tradition ] '', 
  we germans really care about what other countries think of us . 
  i have to admit , one of the first things i did when i had internet on my pc was go on youtube and search for videos of foreigners discribing their stay in germany . 
  and judging by the view count and the number of these video i 'm far from the only one who does that . 
  i think after americans , we are the most prone to open a thread to ask what other countries think of us . 
  what hospital ? 
  you mean that building with that big red target cross on it ? 
  yes . 
  well the actual text is only on alsace , but it could mean both . 
  ( poor lorraine , only ever mentioned alongside alsace ), 
  i have to admit , your slogan is the best . 
  our is `` wir machen 's einfach '' ( `` we just do it '' ) . 
  it 's like they threw a 1 $ coin into the generic slogan generator . 
  still better than saxony-anhalt though . 
  well it kinda is . 
  [ how does a saxon order a christmas tree ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/pzd6wl2tt84?t=125 ), 
  [ when you live in a society without money , in which the only motivation is the strife for constant improvement and your biggest worry is if your earl grey is hot enough . 
  ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/7/76/picard_und_earl_grey.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131012114900&amp;path-prefix=de ), 
  the people of westphalia are more saxon than the saxons . 
  what a sad story of identity theft . 
  a user from luxembourg made [ this map ] ( https://i.redd.it/t9ywor81n39y.png ) about germany . 
  i think it 's pretty accurate . 
  i 've met my delegate to the bundestag once . 
  it was when i was back in school , we did a week trip to berlin . 
  that guy , was ( and is ) an serious embarrassment . 
  instead of telling us what his actual job is , he ranted about how shitty the traffic in berlin is and how is driver had a car accident recently and now his staff car is in the repair shop . 
  you can tell that story at a dinner party , but why on earth would you think a school class cares ? 
  did n't surprise me when i read later that the guy takes money from lobbyists like crazy . 
  and he is still in the bundestag , almost 10 years after this trip . 
  sure hope his car is fixed by now !, 
  well i think it 's okay for them to answer if they live here ( preferably a view years ) . 
  an american flag in the flair does n't mean the person lives in the us , it just means they identify as an american or are us-citizen ( regardless if they have a second , european nationality ) . 
  [ much better ] ( https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcr6_op_gt_gbqyz6wgzrn2o7u5mrpl16qakocihgynqqxut4t4avw ), 
  well to be exact there are variations of yiddish . 
  i mean the western ( or central western ) variation . 
  your grandmothers probably spoke an eastern variation . 
  german history classes are focused on europe , germany and france in particular . 
  in lower grades we talked about the american revolution and the us in the world wars , but not in great detail . 
  for the last 3 years you could choose 3 topics to focus on . 
  i took history , biology and german . 
  in those history classes we got a little deeper into us history , but it still was not that much more than we did before . 
  the entire american revolution for example was just a presenation a class mate and i did . 
  we also did the great depression and the cold war on top of the world wars . 
  overall history classes in school suck . 
  the only topic we ever got in detail were the french revolution , the formation of the german empire , the world wars and the german partition . 
  history at university level is a thousand times more interesting , since you can choose topics to focus on . 
  i even did a lecture on the american west . 
  we read michener 's centennial and looked at the history from the perspective of the people that already lived there , instead of the people arriving . 
  it really changes how view certain events and developments . 
  i do n't know why people keep associating pennsylvania german with low german , it 's not that at all . 
  it 's closest relative is palatinate german , which is a rhenish franconian dialect . 
  it also has strong alemannic influences from swiss german and swabian . 
  but palatiante german is so close that i can understand pa without problem and they can somewhat understand me if i speak dialect . 
  this is also why yiddish works well with them , yiddish has also very strong palatinate influences , as one of the largest ashkenazi jewish communities came from the palatinate . 
  rhenish franconian actually . 
  stay . 
  = 3 i solved it !, 
  it 's the wurst of both worlds !, 
  so germany is europe 's bosom ? 
  sweeeeet . 
  as a member of the [ lazy generation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjouncap-yc ) , yes please . 
  more days off . 
  celebrating europe is a bonus . 
  well i think native american history and folklore is pretty interesting . 
  personally i 'm more into the meso-american cultures though , so aztecs and maya ( among others ) for me . 
  my grandma always watched that and denver clan . 
  oh , i completely forgot that exists !, 
  also speaking of [ dragon ball ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epvjr5wwczm ) . 
  we were truly blessed with great intros . 
  for me it 's [ this show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5wvwugblma ) . 
  nobody i know remembers it . 
  [ kickers !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snrnvuozbws ), 
  the irish power rangers !, 
  i really liked that show as a child . 
  a lot of those disney shows had great opening themes , but i did n't like the actual shows all that much . 
  darkwing duck is the exception . 
  great intro , great show . 
  i still quote it to this day . 
  i 'd also like to add that all of the [ trek-shows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc_0ii3slp0 ) had [ great themes . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvxaugasm0 ) well except [ enterprise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djh2deemxj0 ) maybe , but even that was okay i guess . 
  [ johto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-tgypsllau ) is actually my favorite pok\u00e9mon theme . 
  also the last season i watched . 
  loved the games , but the show was too repetitive for me . 
  and by the time naruto hit tv i pretty much had stopped watching the channel with that stuff anyway . 
  i was gaming on my pc or one of my consoles instead . 
  so i never got into the show . 
  the intro was just the final nail in the coffin of my interest . 
  i think the last anime i watched on tv was [ one piece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzk9nn-u9sm ) . 
  the [ second season intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99t_hlpfag ) of that show was really good . 
  you guys should have bought the german music and added some filters to make it sound vaguely dutch . 
  problem solved . 
  :d maybe it is the nostalgia goggle , but i think late 90 's and early 2000 's kid show dubs where really good in germany . 
  especially with songs . 
  they either used the japanese as basis or made something on their own , which was usually not bad either . 
  but later they just bought the english themes which gave us this ... [ abomination ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8xotbzrzko ) . 
  ( that 's the australian theme afaik ) * shudder *,
