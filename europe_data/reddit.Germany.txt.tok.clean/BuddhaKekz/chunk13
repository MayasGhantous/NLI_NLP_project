  that 's unfortunate , i think the awesome intro and battle music is what got me into the show ( i stayed for the characters ) . 
  series 2 continued with the [ amazing theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnbgn6em2y8 ) , but the show itself was n't at good . 
  i probably would have turned off , but i had nothing better to do and the [ songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ygow365j_y ) in the show were really [ good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oima_e84o1y ) too . 
  do you like it ? 
  it does n't sound very poweful to me , it would n't get me hyped for an episode like our version did ( which i think used the same melody as the japanese original ) . 
  follow up question : what music played when the digimon where digivolving ? 
  something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5u0roukuug ) ? 
  the french version sounds more chill , while the english and german version are slighty more energetic i think . 
   i guess that 's the same in italian though , otherwise that place that sold me `` pizza funghi '' recently has some explaining to do . 
  :d not sure if complaining will do you much good , they always make such a fuzz when i try return my couch pizza . 
  i ordered salami and months later it is funghi . 
  i think that is fraud !!, 
  it might have been just the sound quality difference . 
  but yeah i remember that episode !, 
  but i also had watched watership down at that point , so i already had ptsd before . 
  guys , show me your [ digimon themes !,

  when i was in school , one day in p.e. 
  my class started singing the german theme of the [ gummibears ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo1gbsuztwu ) . 
  i do n't know why we did it , but we did . 
  our teacher did n't mind , he was super chill . 
  that car was dope . 
   the animals of farthing wood yes , it was [ `` als die tiere den wald verliesen '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bddd0nfbclo ) ( when the animals left the woods ) in germany . 
  is it just me or is the german opening a little more intense ? 
  bananas you say ? 
  i have to try that . 
  [ your mom . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zxdo4dl7su )    also i once had a pizza with chicken , apple and curry . 
  it was pure heaven in pizza form . 
   t&t has one of the highest murder rates in the world . 
  ay , did n't know that . 
  scratch that then . 
  costa rica seems quite nice , though maybe it just looks so good in comparison with it 's neighbors . 
  some of the caribbean nations like trinidad and tobago and barbados . 
  also many of the pacific island nations . 
  those are pretty peaceful . 
  i 'm so glad i downloaded them all when it was still possible . 
  since then cbs send the bloodhounds to prevent that . 
  atleast on youtube they only got bits and pieces of it and i never found another site that offers a download . 
  and yes lord of the weed is really good too . 
  i actually saw it first , so it kinda introduced me to siw . 
   hoch auf dem gelben wagen - sung by our former president [ my favorite version was sung by the ~ ~ tng ~ ~ siw crew . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj7v26kzg6o ), 
  my grandparents too . 
  i always thought dialing with them was oddly satisfying . 
  i 'm not sure if that was ever a thing in germany . 
  we never really had arcades , if i remember correctly because they were seen as the same gambling under our law . 
  so you basically could only place arcade machines were you could gamble . 
  it changed later , but by the time the great time of arcades was already over , most gamers had a home console or a pc ( or both ) . 
  i know ddr for consoles was sold here , but i do n't think it did that well . 
  adriano celentano movies were actually pretty big in germany . 
  he was almost as beloved as bud spencer and terrance hill . 
  so yeah i guess a lot of the german 25 + redditors will know it . 
  the story behind the song is that celentano never learned to speak english , despite him being enamored with american pop-culture ( especially 50 's rock and elvis ) . 
  so he made up a word that sounded english and made a song out of it . 
  atleast that 's what i read , correct me if i 'm wrong italian fans . 
  yep , zone 1 . 
  the era of colonization was way too short for germany , there never was any real connection . 
  interestingly , the most of the former colonies are now countries that are quite well off , when compared to other former colonies . 
  cameroon , togo , ghana , burundi , kenya and namibia are all relatively stable . 
  and the pacific islands , are well , pacific islands . 
  stability through tranquility . 
  qingdao in china is also one of the countries richer cities and they still brew their beer according to german purity law . 
  still no basis for a union , it 's pretty much a historical footnote . 
  also the first 3 otto movies . 
  i 'm not sure if i felt one . 
  5 or 6 years ago the ground started shaking for a second . 
  not much happened , it was just a quick vibration . 
  might have been some construction work too , but i do n't remember that there was a construction site at the time anywhere near my house . 
  so i guess it was a small quake ? 
  either way , i think it would like this , only going on for longer and shaking a lot more . 
  i was baptized and had the first communion when i was 10 . 
  that was also the last time i ever entered a church during service . 
  i never believed any of the stuff , even as a small child . 
  i was an atheist before i could even spell the word . 
  ( does that make me sound like a damn hipster ? ), 
  it helped that my entire family is rather agnostic and also a wild mix of different confessions . 
  my father is a protestant , my mother was supposed to be serbian orthodox , but when she was born there were no churches near her , so her father decided she would be catholic like her mother . 
  also had a jewish great-grandmother , but she died before i was born . 
  let 's take a break in ~ ~ istanbul ~ ~ constantinople on the way . 
  so often that [ this guy ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/4/4b/vegetaitsover9000-02.png/revision/latest?cb=20100724145819 ) crashed his scouter . 
  hey guys its me ur pope . 
  i like it , but it wont stop us from destroying the french flag !, 
  i do n't know anyone who is into it personally . 
  i love ancient mythologies myself and spent quite some time reading about it , so i 've come across neo-pagans online . 
  and honestly , i think a lot of them are dreadfully ill-informed about ancient religions . 
  i can understand not wanting to go through the old rituals , as a few of them require you to sacrifce animals . 
  no , what irks me , is the application of modern values to ancient gods . 
  i do n't agree with much of the stuff that happens in ancient myths either ( like scylla getting cursed for being raped ) , but i do n't want to worship those guys . 
  but if you do , accept the gods for what they are and do n't make up some modern day bs about demeter being a feminist or anubis being some kind of furry . 
  european : portugal and norway . 
  non-europan : angola , trinidad and tobago , east timor, 
  ah en schlabbefligger also . 
  about 30km to the east of neustadt . 
  are you from the pirmasens/zweibr \u00fccken area ? 
  mods are pretty lenient though . 
  for example yesterday had an english post on the frontpage . 
  as long as it 's only every then and now , nobody bats and eye . 
  whipped or vanilla cream . 
  either way , they are delicious .
