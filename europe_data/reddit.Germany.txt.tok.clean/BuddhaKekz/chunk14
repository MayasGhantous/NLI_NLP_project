  it 's not a national day , but here in the palatinate we are very proud of [ hambach festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hambach_festival ) . 
  to this day we have some celebrations at the end of may and politicians give speeches at the historical sites . 
  since 1984 we also have the rheinland-pfalz-tag . 
  every year one city is chosen to host it . 
  it was invented by our then minister president bernhard vogel , to create a sense of unity . 
  the fact is , the state was formed after ww2 by the french out of parts of the country that historically never have been together ( aside from overall the hre/german empire ) . 
  even 40 years after the war , the regions of rhineland-palatinate were , what we call `` fremdeln '' in german . 
  basically not really working together , because we did n't know each other that well . 
  the celebration still has the air of phoneyness to it , but on the other hand it 's an excuse to drink and to party and here in rlp , we never backdown from getting shit-faced . 
  * * ^ ^ ^ ^ except ^ ^ ^ ^ me , ^ ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ drink . 
  personally i 'm a fan of [ windbeutel ] ( http://www.duden.de/_media_/full/w/windbeutel-201020596498.jpg ) . 
  do n't you fear , [ kabs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_mosquito_control_association ) is here !, 
  the upper rhine used to be a malaria zone . 
  thanks to their tireless work you can actually dare to open a window on a summer evening , atleast for a few minutes and not get contracted with potentially deadly diseases . 
  while it is n't the center geographially , it is the end of our main street and the place where our most famous monument stands . 
  the aptly named [ cathedral square ] ( http://s3.germany.travel/media/content/staedte___kultur_1/unesco_welterben_2013/speyererdom_2/domplatz_karlhoffmann_ret.jpg ) ( domplatz ) . 
  right in the middle you can see a bowl . 
  that is the so called `` domnapf '' . 
  when we get a new bishop it is filled to the brim with wine and every passerby can take a cup and get as much as they want . 
  * brain explodes *, 
  i knew you knew i was being sarcastic and just added another layer of sarcasm , hence i responded by explaining the joke to keep the joke rolling ... this comment chain got way too meta . 
  so readers know to take it as a joke . 
  after all i 'm talking about real people . 
  some may consider it bad taste to suggest their execution . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ did ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ruin ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ joke ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ humor ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ new ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ me . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ help . 
  they are all transported to france , they still have guillotines there . 
   ufos ca n't land in ch\u00e2teauneuf du pape i hope that , when extraterrestrial ever come to earth , they land exactly there and then get fined . 
   kissing on the cheek as a greeting is acceptable with your close male friends .

  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 look at a [ map ] ( http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wggerman/images/dkarte.gif ) of the german states and ask yourself , which one is the only state which saarland borders . 
  more than 100 years of bavarian occupation is enough , i do n't need to be mistaken for one in today 's world . 
   i stay at home and play computer games . 
  feelsgoodman ** ftfy **, 
  judging by his other posts in this subreddit , he is spanish . 
  so not exactly a prussian . 
  it may sound weird to non-germans , but i think the being mistaken for a bavarian thing is worse for me than the nazi stuff . 
  with the latter i alteast no that it is supposed to be a joke or immature insult in most cases , the majority of people know that todays germans are n't nazis . 
  but the bavarian thing is genuine , a lot of foreigners ( mostly non-eu ) really think that we are all lederhosen wearing yodeling mountain climbers . 
  and even though you guys are my natural enemies , i can honestly say , i would rather be mistaken for a saarlander than a bavarian . 
  that 's correct . 
  we do have beer here too , but it 's just the number 2 beverage behind wine . 
  i 'd say pretty much everyone in germany has a local accent . 
  with some people it is of course much less pronounced , but if you listen closely you can often tell where someone is from . 
  naturally people with almost no local accent also exist , especially among people working with their voices ( news anchors , radio hosts , those people who record voices for announcements ) . 
  well we have american restaurants in my hometown . 
  both are owned by the same person , so they are pretty much the same . 
  considering it was worth it to build the same restaurant twice in a town of 50.000 , they must be earning good money . 
  anyway , they offer a lot of burgers , steaks , mac & cheese , nachos and all kinds of sugary beverages . 
  everything stereotypcally associated with the us . 
  they do however not offer any of the special services , so no free refills , not tons of ice in every drink , no ac keeping the temperature below freezing point and no touchy waitresses that ask `` if everything is alright '' every 2 seconds . 
  i remember back in the early 2000 's there was a debate whether a law should enforce that 35 % of the radio music would be german , but in the end they made the station decide if they want to do that or not . 
  so i guess the average is below that . 
  we have a bunch of emperors in the tomb of our cathedral . 
  there is a legend attached to them , that they once awoke from their eternal slumber to safe germany during the napoleonic wars , the battle of leipzig . 
  [ here is a statue that depicts the ghostly kings and emperors .

   countries are n't like trading cards . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  i will start my turn by playing pot of greece which allows me to draw two more debts . 
  the question should be , do they even want a state ? 
  there are two kinds of roma , those perfectly well integrated in their respective home countries and the traveling folk . 
  the former surely do n't want to leave their lives , just to build a completly new state from the ground up and the latter are nomads , they do n't really care for a state . 
  so in other words , if they do n't want it , why would i ? 
  i plan to do it . 
  i want to watch all classic eddie murphy films , so it 's on the list ( and also one of the few still missing ) . 
  i guess the jamie lee curtis thing was intentional . 
  while i never watched the movie , the fact that she wears lederhosen ( as pointed out by that priest ) , is a sign that , her not even knowing what swedish people are like , is part of the joke . 
  the benny hill one , yeah he was even speaking german phrases ( `` guck mal '' ) . 
  unless our languages are closer than i thought , it 's probably more of a `` they wont be able to tell the difference anyway '' - situation . 
  yep , pretty much in the middle between the two , closer to heidelberg , but on the rhine 's western bank . 
  there is a bridge close to where i live with quite a few of them . 
  never used on myself though . 
  [ ^ ^ ^ stupid ^ ^ ^ locks ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ hate ^ ^ ^ them ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pc2howq.png ), 
  you are right . 
  i was in a hurry , when i posted my reply to the first guy and only skimmed through wikipedia . 
  i missread jim crow-laws as the name of the guy who came up with them . 
  i was more focused on the segeration part and unfortunately had the preconcived notion that it was a person , due to the wording in the guys post . 
  being told it was a person by another redditor did n't make me go back and fact check either . 
  i do n't like refering to people with the word `` race '' in general . 
  it 's common in english , but taboo in german . 
  i do n't think i have to explain why . 
  that 's why i try to avoid the word even in english . 
  it also does n't matter anyway . 
  a black man born and raised in germany , is just as german as his white neighbor . 
  yeah looked it up by now . 
  great a douchebag . 
  i honestly feel insulted by the comparison . 
  but i guess that was the point . 
  edit : jim crow is not actually a person . 
  sorry for the slip up . 
  i wont delete it , as a testament to my lacking reading comprehension . 
  well okay then , as i said , i 'm willing to call anyone what they like to be called . 
  from personal experience though , most people i know with a black and a white parent , prefer black . 
  i did n't mean to imply everybody does though . 
  i do n't know who jim crow is or what his agenda is , but barack obama had a white mother and still was considered to be america 's first black president . 
  so were all the people who said that racist ? 
  as far as i know he self identified more as balck than white , so is obama a racist ? 
  besides people with one black parent usually look more black than not .
