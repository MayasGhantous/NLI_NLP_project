  [ i wish ] ( https://www.autoextrem.de/artikel-attachments/151531d1382969079-stau-autobild.jpg ) in reality with breaks and traffic it was 9 - 10 hours . 
  though one quarter of the distance was spent in denmark , which does have a speed limit , but also less clogged roads . 
  [ what i had to do first ] ( http://imgur.com/a/xskrz ) yeah seems like quite the distance , however nothing too bad . 
  i would n't drive it for work , but for a day trip it 's possible . 
  depending on the traffic . 
  the longest actual car trip i ever went on was 980 km or about 600 miles . 
  any further distance is better traveled by plane . 
  huh , i did n't know that and neither do any of the restaurants in my vicinity as it turns out . 
  i admit i went mostly for the joke anyway , i prefer wiener-art . 
  by the way , most restaurants here also have schnitzel ( coated ) with bolognese . 
  pretty sure they are just trolling at this point . 
  someone is jealous of j\u00e4gerschnitzel . 
  of course kahn tried to imitate his rival in an attempt to understand his awesome goalkeeping power . 
  but only the [ true tarzan ] ( http://www.noz.de/media/2013/09/03/kampfhund-kein-dackel-lauterns-torwart-gerald-eh_full.jpg ) ever mastered the might of the jungle . 
   i 'm sorry this is such a long answer no it 's cool , thanks for the indepth explanation !, 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ that . 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ i 've ^ ^ ^ made ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ personal ^ ^ ^ experience ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ dutch ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ dislike ^ ^ ^ hearing ^ ^ ^ it , ^ ^ ^ especially ^ ^ ^ coming ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ germans . 
  it really depends on who you ask . 
  most comedians like to do bavarian , swabian , saxonian , colognian and berlinerish . 
  but really most dialects can be funny , if they are alien enough to what you are used to ( which pretty much happens all the time , because they differ so much ) . 
  well then , you should join the rest of the germanic languages and make it happen in english too , it 's really useful . 
   aqua - and agriculture . 
  sorry off-topic , but my english teachers always told me that you ca n't do that . 
  replacing the last part of a compound word with an '' - '' , if the next compound words ends the same way , that is . 
  we actually do that in german and i would guess norwegian does it too . 
  so it always annoyed me that i was told that i ca n't do it in english . 
  can any native speaker confirm or deny , whether my teachers taught me bs or not ? 
  how far to the right are they ? 
  closer to center-right or right wing populists ? 
  but why would you field kahn when you can field [ tarzan ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3596/1214/1600/ehrmann.jpg ) ? 
  explanation : this is gerry ehrmann ( nickname `` tarzan '' ) . 
  in the 90 's he was the gk of kaiserslautern , one of the biggest rivals of karlsruhe ( kahn 's club at the time ) . 
  since they had a similar personality , they were often compared . 
  true fans of football of course know that ehrmann was the superior keeper . 
  sure , there is nothing wrong with using it , if it 's appropriate like in literature studies , philosophy or even theology . 
  it 's just annoying to see so many , mostly english-speaking , self-proclaimed scholars teaching people about `` feelings '' that only exist in the german language . 
  the thing is that most languages can express the same thoughts , some need several words , others have one term for it too . 
  so nothing special about german in that regard . 
  probably nothing , but that does n't stop people from writing [ blogposts ] ( https://eebelz.com/2015/09/04/ruinenlust-taking-pleasure-in-ruins/ ) about it . 
  not to my knowledge . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_placeholder_names_by_language#german ) does n't have it either . 
  max mustermann is the name you find on a lot of sample forms ( like this is what your driver license would look like ) . 
  his `` wife '' is erika mustermann . 
  the name mustermann is a pun in that case , as it means `` sample man '' . 
  another one which is used by market research is `` otto normalverbraucher '' ( otto average consumer or average joe ) . 
  the female variant would be lieschen m\u00fcller . 
  the latter actually came from movie , about a secretary and somehow became synonymous with `` average jane '' . 
  do n't be sad , i always speak dutch when i have a throat infection . 
  man , have n't you heard , only german is that weird wacky language that has a word for everything . 
  yes those are real words we use all the time and not just some rare philosophical terms that get picked up by bloggers for their click-bait articles . 
  i 'm not handsome enough to make a gottkanzler face . 
  no , in fact i only dated women that had a different nationality than me so far . 
  it was n't even on purpose , i just seem to have an easier time to start a conversation with someone from a different country , than with german women . 
  however one of the women also held german citizenship . 
  that 's the closest i 've got to dating a german . 
  stupid napoleon , took away half of our region and gifted it to the gelbf\u00fc\u00dfler of all people !, 
  we maybe parted by state lines , but the kurpfalz is still part of us . 
  whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better we belong , we belong we belong together, 
  ca n't have enough . 
   at least the ones in the region where i live ( kurpfalz ) there is a reason we are called `` krischer '' ( screamers or screechers ) . 
  i 'm lucky my late mother was very precise in her hand written recipes . 
  that way her excellent cooking can be appreciate by future generations . 
  exact instructions !, 
  [ i love you !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vow9czgqbqe ), 
  yes , i would . 
  you have never seen me in the kitchen . 
  i need exact instructions , any kind of leeway will only lead to terrible results . 
  like everything , i measure in metric . 
  i also hate it when the recipe says `` a pinch of salt '' . 
  what 's a pinch ? 
  i can get different amounts between my fingers !, 
  and yes , i know in that case it 's up to the cook how much he wants , but i 'm really bad at improvisation in the kitchen . 
  i need exact recipes to avoid disasters . 
  atleast when it comes to cooking , i 'm for reasons unknown pretty good at baking , even without instructions . 
  [ my face when we federalize ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hvhg1cq.gif ), 
  i would actually say it depends on where in germany you are . 
  the more to the south you go , the more dialect you will hear , to the point where people will struggle to speak accent-free standard german . 
  however speaking dialect at work , atleast in `` higher '' fields is often seen as unprofessional . 
  if staff has to interact with people from all over germany , only speaking dialect would be a hindrance . 
  smaller companies , like bakeries or repair shops allow it though , as they usally deal with regional customers . 
  in fact i would say it 's seen as positive there , as it helps to preserve the regional identity . 
   do n't trust the rabbit did a nice video on 12 of the big dialects in germany . 
  she tries her best  oh boy . 
  i mean yeah she tried , but it 's probably better to look up videos with actual dialect speakers . 
  her palatinatian for example sounded like a weird mix between hessian and standard german , but not remotely like my dialect . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xavmy1bdnmm ) is serves the purpose better . 
  it was made for german speakers though , so i 'd say skip through the parts and listen to the dialects . 
  they cover a lot . 
  he was a racist , but his stories were dope !, 
  as far as i know all members of esa have their own space agency , though in most countries it 's the same thing as their aeronautical authority . 
  from his years as a priest he learned a certain way to speak . 
  so yes his speeches often sounded like sermons , but it is the content which is important . 
  so i ask you , can you provide as speech in which he actively promoted his believes ? 
  and what about that proposed affiliation of the cdu with the catholic church ? 
  any hard facts for that ? 
  i mentioned zentrum because they were a party which had a direct and open affiliation with the catholic church . 
  i mentioned other religions to show that the `` christian '' in cdu does n't mean the party is for christians only . 
  and at last : you brought up the supposed hypocrisy when you said : `` but we preach secularity non-stop to other countries . 
  something something wine and water '' if that is not calling out hypocrisy , i do n't know what is .
