  do n't worry , we were not talking about invading poland and creating lebensraum at all . 
  why would we do that ? 
  that would be silly .

  it 's always nice when you can come to an agreement on the internet . 
  it got better , but one of the most beautiful cities in germany is still a stretch in my eyes . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ also : ^ ^ ^ ^ m\u00e4\u00e4nz ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ \u00e4 ^ ^ ^ ^ dreckloch . 
   frankfurt is one of the most beautiful cities in germany . 
  [ did i just read that wrong or did you really call frankfurt one of the most beautiful cities in germany ?

  ** humorless german mode activate ** that would actually be a detour since the french border is just 50km to the south for me . 
  ** humorless german mode de-activate **, 
   palatium is also the word that `` paladin '' that 's correct . 
  though if we go that far down the rabbit hole we might as well call it `` rheinland benedict cumberbatch '' . 
  if the internet taught me anything , then that cumberbatch 's name is related to every possible combination of words . 
  na , that 's too long of a drive . 
  france however is pretty close . 
  that 's actually a rather literal translation . 
  rheinland to rhineland should be clear and a * pfalz * is a stronghold . 
  the word comes from latin * palatium * . 
  later the word was also used to describe the land around the stronghold . 
  a similar thing happened in england , after the norman conquest , when nobles founded * county palatines * which were also called * palatinates * . 
  so the closest thing to the german pfalz is the english palatinate . 
  they screwed up my homestate 's name the worst . 
  seriously ? 
  i have to fight somebody now to get that anger out of my system !, 
  it does n't have to be the north . 
  here in the southwest we had two days of snow , though hardly 1cm and mostly in patches not covering everything . 
  and that is still more than we had the entire last year . 
  i think it 's atleast about 10 years ago since i last saw decent ( by that i mean like 5cm ) snow around my place . 
   i was more shocked with futanari in russia . 
  google it ( nsfw/nsfl ) . 
  [ but ... 
  why ? 
  almost : `` state achievement pin '' would be the literal translation . 
  landes = state ( short for bundesland i assume ) errungeschaft = achievement anstecknadel = pin, 
  while traditionally the foreign minister goes to the ( biggest ) coalition partner , if think that usually the case because that minister is also the vice-chancellor . 
  maybe schulz could be foreign minister , but not vice-chancellor . 
  like steinmeier currently . 
  aside from that minister of the interior , economic and labour seem to be the best choices . 
  they also would be a waste of his talent . 
  anything but chancellor or atleast foreign minister would be , i think . 
  good point . 
  still ca n't see him win though . 
  not only because of merkel , but also because he was absent from german interior politics for so long . 
  i think roughly half a year of being a foreign secretary will not be enough to make the average voter familiar with him . 
  so it 's a 50/50 for a second try . 
  still i think gabriel will probably try to position himself as the candidate after merkel 's 4th term . 
  unless he is out of the picture by that point . 
  but there are others too like kraft , scholz and dreyer ( if her health allows it ) . 
  i hope he just becomes foreign minister and not the spd chancellor candidate . 
  not that i think he would n't make a good chancellor , in fact i would probably vote for him . 
  but he would have to run against merkel , which means he would lose . 
  you could send santa clause to run against her and he would lose . 
  everybody would . 
  now the problem is , we have that weird unspoken rule in germany that says you only get one chance . 
  when you do n't make it , your party wont consider to name you as a candidate again . 
  i 'm sure there are exceptions to that , but even so , after losing once , it seems unlikely that he would win the next time . 
  that 's why i want gabriel to be this election 's spd candidate . 
  make him lose badly , so he finally leaves politics forever and then , after merkel decided 4 terms is enough , make schulz run against von der leyen or de maizi\u00e8re . 
  that i could see him win . 
  duh , it 's police wench of course !, 
  now you listen here !, 
  she is not the prime minister , she is a very naughty girl !, 
  like old times ? 
  i have a better idea , you go back to really old times and resurrect the roman empire . 
  what could go wrong if roman legions and german auxiliaries march side by side ? 
  i mean , maybe we sack rome a couple of times , but aside from that i think the idea is pretty solid .

  but do n't they have polar opposite political goals ? 
  why would they work together if one party wants brexit , a hard one if necessary , while the other wants no brexit at all ? 
  tell me if anyone of those is doing anything for you . 
  you can also use the word `` fickpr\u00fcgel '' for a dick . 
  he does n't have much political power , but he can desolve the parliament and he can veto laws if he thinks they are unconstitutional . 
  he is also allowed to have his own opinion , but he does represent the german people as a whole , so a controversial opinion can cost him his post as has happend with horst k\u00f6hler . 
  this statement by steinmeier is n't really controversial though . 
  obligaroty : why is north africa so more maps at jakubmarian.com ? 
  young, 
  alexander the grape *, 
  in some parts of south-western germany too . 
  though you could argue that we pronounce the `` p '' so soft , that it almost sounds like a `` b '' . 
  strategos is of course an exaggerated example . 
  though theoretically even a fisherman could be a good strategos , you need a certain degree of education . 
  but there were other , less education dependend offices that were still closed of to low and medium incomes . 
  to be honest , it 's been a while since i read about the athenian democracy and since i 'm currently traveling i ca n't really do the research . 
  i do n't want to spread false information based in faulty memory either , so i call it quits here . 
  debating a controversal topic like the athenian democracy in mobile is a bit difficult anyway . 
  how can kids these days write so much on phones , it drives me insane . 
  citizens were split in income groups , some offices could only be optained by the highest income group . 
  either by law or because they did n't get payed for the work , so you needed to be wealthy to do the job . 
  a simple fisher for example could not be strategos , because he needed to catch fish for a living and had no time to plan wars . 
  if the office was payed the fisher could have done it ( lacking education aside ) . 
  athenian citizens were by no means equal . 
  and i 'm only talking about citizens here , so free adult men that were born in athens . 
  everyone else was n't even considered a citizen . 
  always prefered kibler anyway . 
  smartmer ? 
  are those really intelligent elves ?
