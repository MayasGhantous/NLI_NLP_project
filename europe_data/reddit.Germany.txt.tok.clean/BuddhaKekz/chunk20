  in germany for example it 's almost exclusively crime shows , some historical dramas , the run of the mill romantic comedy ( with matthias schweigh\u00f6fer and/or till schweiger ) or some game shows . 
  you would never see something like game of thrones , the walking dead , avengers , star wars and so on from germany . 
  it 's not like it is a budget thing . 
  we could do it . 
  we would also have to make sure it sells internationally to make a profit , but that is n't impossible , especially if you co-produce with other countries . 
  we sometimes do that and have done it quite a lot in the past . 
  that also gave us the know-how . 
  the neverending story for example was an epic fantasy movie produced in germany . 
  and as last point , the bbc is doing much better with shows and movies than any german production company on a tighter budget . 
  so there is really no reason for us not to produce some fantasy or sci-fi stuff . 
  but we do n't , because the 103rd crime show still sells well enough to make a profit and we have enough nazi-uniforms lying around to make wwii movies for another 1000 years . 
  all i want is some good escapist fiction dammit !, 
  i already know them , but thank you . 
  that 's actually why yi came first to my mind when i posted . 
  the dude was quite the badass . 
  half of europe tbh \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  a good naval commander , though i think he unjustly overshadows other great ones like [ yi sun-sin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yi_sun-sin ) , [ michiel de ruyter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michiel_de_ruyter ) and [ hayreddin barbarossa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hayreddin_barbarossa ) . 
  for the palatinate we have [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3jcps-q1dq ) . 
  not an anthem but you also hear it pretty often : [ palzlied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilkklzzndqk ), 
  there are differences , but they are n't very big . 
  atleast not much bigger than the differences between the different regions within germany . 
  linguistically austrians belong to the austro-bavarian group , that means most dialects spoken in austria are related to bavarian . 
  and people who can understand each other , usually also get along pretty well . 
  culturally there are some differences , most of them come from the differing historical and political paths both nations took . 
  some are the result of geography . 
  i also think it 's important to note that christoph waltz speaks from the viennese perspective . 
  big cities like that always differ in culture from the surrounding land . 
  just like the people of berlin are very different from the rest of germany , vienna is very different from the rest of austria . 
  currently no drawback because of all the high energy !, 
  memes aside , i come from an old social democrat family . 
  both my parents ' sides had spd members and i am naturally drawn to their policies . 
  i even supported agend 2010 to some degree , i think it was necessary at the time . 
  problem was , that the spd kept weakening their own left wing ( or what was * left * of it ) in favour of the right wing . 
  and honestly , if i wanted neo-liberal enconomics with social freedoms , i 'd vote fdp or cdu . 
  so i stopped voting for them , on the federal level atleast . 
  in my state they are actually still competent , despite some scandals around a certain airport ( no not ber , i 'm talking about hahn ) . 
  anyway i voted the pirates for a bit , but they just imploded . 
  so i went to the greens , but they are nowadays the m\u00fcsli version of the cdu . 
  the left is too anti-eu for my taste . 
  if gysi was still at the helm maybe , but not with wagenknecht at the top . 
  so i was basically out of options for the 2017 bundestag-election . 
  luckily the spd listened to my conversation that i had since 2014 , in which i expressed my wish for schulz as the next candidate for the spd . 
  now i 'm back on the train !, 
  no brakes and bridges everywhere !, 
  it does n't matter who gets it , someone is still dying a slow inevitable death and someone else is losing a loved one . 
  are you serious ? 
  i 'd pay for half a dozen of children if it ment i never had to lose anymore family members to cancer . 
  if you had ever lost someone to that you 'd realize how stupid this questions is . 
  while i 'm personally not really a fan , my rather small hometown of 45.000 people produces an incredible amount of basketball talent . 
  one of my classmates even made it too the german national team . 
  that and weight lifting and wrestling for some reason ( we even send some athletes to the olympics ) , are the sports my town is really good at . 
  that will never stop blowing my mind . 
   even when we entered the eu it was sang in german at the celebration . 
  huh ... maybe the eu is the 4th reich after all . 
  yes you can say that , but boreal and austral are very rare . 
  especially austral is practically only used in location names ( like the austral islands ) , i would say . 
  the orient is pretty much the muslim world plus israel and india to me . 
  it seems [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orient ) agrees with me :  in german , orient is usually used synonymously with the area between the near east and india , including israel , the arab world , and greater persia . 
  just to be clear , i 'm not accusing you of being a sympathizer of the dailystormer . 
  i just want you to think about who posts such memes and why . 
  also , yes smart enlightened people have supported wars in the past , especially wwi was supported by many people in a lot of countries , because the previous wars during that time were rather small scale and did n't cost that many lives . 
  on top of that the public believed the propaganda that russia and/or france were planning to attack anyway . 
  however cherrypicking scholars that supported the war does n't mean anything . 
  there were also a lot that demonstrated against the war for example many of the members of the spd . 
  those members would later split to form the uspd under karl liebknecht and rosa luxemburg . 
  are the male members of that party any less manly because they did not support the war ? 
  what did supporting the war even proof ? 
  that war caused nothing but misery for the entire continent and left it in ruins for half a century . 
  i 'm sorry i do not see a correlation between manlyness and wanting to go to war , or even fighting in general . 
  standing up for what you believe , respecting others , being true to yourself , those i would say are manly , but honestly women can do that just the same , so i rather call it being a good person . 
  that is what we should strife to be , not what those right wing nutjobs think is `` manly '' . 
  in nazi germany there was a propaganda paper called `` st\u00fcrmer '' or `` stormer '' in english . 
  dailystormer is clear reference to that . 
  if that is not enough to make their worldview clear you check wikipedia . 
  [ `` the daily stormer is an american neo-nazi and white supremacist news and commentary website . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_daily_stormer ) and to your question , i have to ask a counterquestion . 
  does supporting war make you a man ? 
  why ? 
  i have to hide my beard under thick layers of beard so the government does n't notice . 
  but pssssst !, 
  dailystormer.com ? 
  i do n't think i will click that link , the name already gives enough context . 
  besides the `` pussification '' of europe is a right wing meme . 
  if an enlightened society is a `` pussy '' society , i gladly call myself a `` pussy '' . 
  in fact those can take a pounding , unlike nuts which are super sensitive and easy to hurt . 
  well there is for example stephen benko 's * virgin goddess : studies in the pagan and christian roots of mariology * ( 1993 ) . 
  he is not the one who came up with a theory but i think his explanation is very rational . 
  the same i have given , but of course backed with evidence . 
  rowena loverance 's * christian art * ( 2007 ) came to the same conclusion . 
  [ here is a google books link . 
  ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=fgq2thigxzec&amp;pg=pa117&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) also to make this clear once again : i 'm not claiming jesus or any of his mythology is based on horus , just the imagery of infant jesus on mary 's lap is most likely based on infant horus sitting on isis ' lap . 
  i think you misunderstood me there . 
  after looking at it seems people took the connection too far and claim jesus is based on horus . 
  that is however not what i 'm saying , i 'm merely pointing out that the imagery of maria holding baby jesus might be based on isis and horus , for the simple reason that it was so common in the roman empire . 
  so if you had no depiction of actual jesus you could take a little isis and horus figurine and `` pretend '' it 's maria with jesus . 
  he wanted to help rebuild the country after the war . 
  he was a social democrat , thus member of a movement that had been surpressed through most of its history . 
  the spd tried their best to make germany democratic after wwi but we all know that did n't go well in the long run . 
  my grandfather saw the end of wwii as a new chance to help create a more stable democracy in germany . 
  unfortunately his brazilian wife and children did not want to go .
