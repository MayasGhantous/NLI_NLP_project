  germany was a cold distand land , they had no connection with . 
  their life was in brazil . 
  so they got divorced and my grandfather moved on . 
  he married a german woman and my father was born . 
  the great thing is that we still have contact to the brazilian family . 
  nothing like a family gathering in brazil , they serve you beef without end . 
  where did he come from ? 
  for example people from the south west ( swabia , alsace , palatinate and so on ) left germany very early due to famines and war . 
  in this case the reason for him leaving could simply be to join family members or close friends who already made in the new world . 
  some historians speculate that this kind of word to mouth was actually one of the biggest draws for settlers . 
  however him going to south america throws a bit of a wrench in that theory , as north america , the balkans and russia/livonia were the typical destinations of early settlers . 
  though maybe the same thing happened to your ancestor that happened to my grandfather , who wanted to migrate to the us after wwi , only to end up on a boat going to brazil . 
  but he stuck with error and just settled there , before returning to germany in the early 50 's . 
  not what you had in mind , but isis ( as in the goddess , not the terrorists ) and horus . 
  isis worhsip was common in the roman empire and she was often depicted with her infant son horus on her lap or in her arms . 
  when christiany was young the worshippers often imitated pagan imagery , because they had not much of their own , since christianity was based on judaism , which is n't a very iconographic religion . 
  most early christians came from pagan backgrounds however and were used to having sculptures and images to worship , so they re-used some stuff that was easily available , like said depictions of isis with horus . 
  * nervously hides photo of serbian grandpa * i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  i admit that it fills me with a certain pride that this is n't the first time i got this kind of comment . 
  americans voted for a donald and did n't expect to get ducked ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ see ^ ^ ^ ^ myself ^ ^ ^ ^ out in all seriousness though , president trump will be a problem for the stability of the western world , if not the whole world . 
  i just hope he does something so unconstitutional that an impeachment against him can be started . 
  against pence too , so we do n't replace one evil with another . 
  is it cheating when i choose [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coikb482aoe ) ? 
  [ amazing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gistf2ldkww ), 
  i can enjoy almost any setting as long as it is deep enough . 
  that means besides the main story there are also things going on that have nothing to do with it . 
  the elder scrolls is very good example of this . 
  nirn is a complex world with lots of unrelated events and even competing histories of what 's going on in the world . 
  i love that they almost never tell you what happened , just giving you different accounts by different people with different agendas . 
  what i dislike however , no matter how complex , are fantasy settings which are connected to our world . 
  narnia and the potterverse are examples of that . 
  i want fantasy to be completey independent from our reality . 
  the same is not true for sci-fi though , in fact there i prefer it if it 's connected to real world . 
  star trek would be the prime example , i really love that universe . 
  mass effect is another good one . 
  another thing i can say about fantasy : i really enjoy non-traditional settings , that means no middle-earth knock-off , but something for example set in a middle eastern/persian/egyptian or east asian world . 
  or something like the roman empire , which the aforementioned elder scrolls series kind-off does . 
  regarding steampunk/clockpunk : i would n't call myself a fan , but i can enjoy it . 
  my favorite steampunk setting is the thief game series ( the dark project and the metal age specifically ) . 
  in general though , i prefer a fantasy setting with steampunk elements , not steampunk itself . 
  cyberpunk : not really a fan , i ca n't think of a setting which i liked there . 
  i would be in the rhineland according to that map . 
  i think it 's important to point out that this map splits europe into areas of equally sized population , not necessarily cultures . 
  however i think the rhineland area is actually a quite fitting cultural region . 
  for the most part you have german speakers with rhine franconian and alemannic dialets and some native french speakers from the alsace , lorraine and luxembourg . 
  considering that i feel culturally closer to the inhabitans of the alsace than to the people of berlin or lower saxony that would work on my part . 
  even if that means i have to share with saarlanders , badians and swabians . 
  atleast no bavarians , am i right ? 
  edit : i also wonder why the maps gives luxembourg city and strasbourg as important markers , when frankfurt ~ ~ and stuttgart ~ ~ ( wrong region according to the map ) for example , both have several times the population of the former . 
   merkel is pretty much going to win it right ? 
  you seem to be under the wrong impression that the schulzzug is equipped with brakes . 
  ### mega #nobrakes #buildthebridge, 
  that solely depends on which is harder . 
   just kidding , just kidding , do n't kill me please . 
  instructions unclear , stuck a knife between your ribs . 
  they are very important , especially since the outcome can affect all of the eu quite a bit . 
  i can only give an outsider view on it , so please correct me if i get something wrong about the candidates and their goals/programs . 
  there is one candidate who is openly against the eu and everything it stands for ( le pen ) . 
  luckily it 's not very likely she will win , but if she does that would have probably the biggest impact ( and also the most negative one from my perspective ) . 
  next on the list of impactors is filion . 
  while he is n't against the european project like le pen is , he is also no promoter of it . 
  in fact many of the things he said make me believe he wants france to further step down from many of it 's responsibilities in europe and focus on itself . 
  which could weaken both the eu and france in the long run . 
  macron is the polar opposite of the former two . 
  he is staunchly pro-european , so the impact of his election would also be great but in the other direction so to speak . 
  i 'm not going to hide the fact that he would be favorite outcome , but i 'm not sure if his chances are good enough . 
  the other candidates probably have less impact than those 3 . 
  the socialists would probably more or less continue the european policies of hollande , so not much would change and france may continue to lose political weight in the union . 
  i do n't know enough about the other parties and their candidates to judge them , but i doubt any of them is going to make it anyway . 
  one last thing : macron & schulz 2017 ** mega **, 
  to be fair , the hat was my father 's idea . 
  i wash my hands in innocence !, 
  `` if the door is closed , just start meowing louder and louder until somebody opens it '' or `` 4 am is a great time for cuddles , do n't hesitate to wake a human to get a good petting . '', 
  would most likely be his words of wisdom . 
  [ do n't expect a lot of action shots ] ( http://imgur.com/a/nxb2g ) , his favorite thing next to eating and grooming is sleeping . 
  i 'm not gon na lie , his beautiful words touched me on an emotional level that was deeper than i would have expected from a less than 30 seconds long video . 
  so you are kinda like that [ guy ] ( http://pm1.narvii.com/5669/4fb1e2072a6698d7e4df6b095caff2c3c43f7ec4_hq.jpg ) ? 
  anyway , not sure if i can speak for all of my country men but i , while appreaciating a fine butt , am more of a boobs man . 
  that said i agree with this [ guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwatwnvkopo ) . 
  [ obligatory oettinger as proof ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rreq8ovw-q ), 
  [ '' ... krnnk sz\u00fc\u00dfz '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dacd1k3bamy ), 
  [ burgerking concubine ] ( http://benedictcumberbatchgenerator.tumblr.com/ ) of course . 
  maybe it is just denmark then ? 
  i admit i mostly base this on these two comics . 
  [ exhibit a ] ( https://satwcomic.com/evil-flag ) and [ exhibit b ] ( https://satwcomic.com/flag-day-every-day ), 
  i would call her hit-or-miss . 
  she has great talent for physical comedy and she is quite gifted in impressions and imitating speech patterns/dialects/accents . 
  however , she is more of an actress than a comedian . 
  i think a lot of her material is written for her , so how good it is depends on the writer . 
  for example i really liked her in switch reloaded , a sketch show that parodied german television and i like her in `` heute show '' , a german version of the daily show . 
  her own show knallerfrauen however ... 
  i saw a few clips that were somewhat funny but most of the time the punchline is just `` look she is doing something that normal women do n't do !, 
  hahaha so funny ! '', 
  that last show is really popular outside of germany though , especially in china of all places . 
  a chinese friend once told me that martina hill is the most famous german actress in china . 
  are n't the scandinavians crazy about their flags ? 
  as in : even decorating their christmas trees with them ? 
  well r/de is for the entire dach region , so germany , austria and switzerland . 
  i think we have a few luxembourgers there too .
