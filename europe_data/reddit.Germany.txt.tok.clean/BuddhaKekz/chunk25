  that 's guaranteed to be funny . 
  has anyone ever told you , come on tell a joke , be funny !, 
  that will always result in not being funny . 
  stuff like that has to come natural man . 
  but i will try my best anyway . 
  i hope this one works in written format : the year is 1945 and adolf hitler is driven along the german countryside in a limousine . 
  suddenly a pig runs onto the road . 
  the driver ca n't hit the breaks in time , the pig ends up dead . 
  hitler decides to be generous with his driver , who has served him for so many years and takes it upon himself to tell the farmer that one of his pigs died . 
  so the f\u00fchrer walks up to a farm house , knocks on the door and a tall strong man opens . 
  `` i must inform you that we accidently killed one of your pigs '' the mustached leader of the german people says . 
  with that the farmer gets visibly angry and punches hitler square in the teeth . 
  he slams the door shut while yelling at poor adolf to piss off , or he 'll get his gun . 
  the very model of an aryan walks back to the car with a swollen face and a defeated look on his face . 
  the journey continues , but alas the driver manages to kill another pig . 
  `` that 's it '' yells adolf , `` now you are explaining to the farmer that you killed another one of his pigs ! '', 
  so the driver departs to go to the farmhouse . 
  after several hours he returns , with lipstick marks on his cheek , ruffled hair , a wrinkled uniform and a basket full of food . 
  hitler wonders , what did you do ? 
  `` well '' , the driver answered , `` i knocked on the door and said `` heil hitler , the pig is dead ! '', 
  an over 70 year old archeology professor at my university once commented a picture of an excavation with : `` this excavation is near bielefeld ... the town does n't exist of course but the excavation does . '', 
  me personally no , but my father always curses people that annoy him in our native dialect . 
  that way , even if they speak german they wont completely understand what he said . 
  i always thought his tone and facial expression make it obvious though . 
  i ca n't let it stand like this . 
  prague is a central european city . 
  latin has no short answers in the way of `` yes '' and `` no '' . 
  if i remember correctly from my latin lessons you can use some verb forms like `` ita '' ( `` i go '' = roughly `` i will do it '' ) and `` non ita '' ( `` i do n't go '' = `` i will not do it '' ) , but they are specific to the question , usually the verb , while `` yes '' and `` no '' are more universal in their usage . 
  i think that 's also how it 's done in some romance languages , atleast on top of using the short answers . 
  atleast in my portuguese lessons i learned that you answer a `` yes or no '' - question by either repeating the verb for `` yes '' or repeating the verb + n\u00e3o for `` no '' . 
  and that even you could also say `` sim '' or `` n\u00e3o '' . 
  my memory might be a bit jumbled , but i read quite a bit about short answers a few years ago . 
  celtic languages did n't use short answers , same as latin . 
  they seem to be a germanic invention , that got hold in most modern languages , be they germanic , romance or not even indo-european . 
  i started looking into that stuff after wondering why english has no equivalent of the german `` doch '' or french `` si '' even though it is related to the former and took a lot from the latter . 
  first things first : what does `` doch/si '' mean ? 
  it is a positve answer to a negative question . 
  for example `` you did not wash the dishes ( , did you ) ? '', 
  in german and french you could easily reply in one word , the aforementioned `` doch '' and `` si '' . 
  in english you have to say `` yes , i did '' to be entirely clear . 
  well it turns out that english actually had a word for that , in fact it also had a word for negative answers for negative questions . 
  those were `` yes '' and `` no '' . 
  in other words `` yes '' was the english equivalent of `` doch/si '' . 
  `` yea '' and `` nay '' used to be the answers to positive questions . 
  but somehow over time english speakers just moved to `` yes '' and `` no '' being the positive answers and `` yea '' and `` nay '' were just alternative ways to say the same thing . 
  i ca n't tell why that happened , i just can tell you when . 
  around the times of shakespeare , as you can find still find the old way `` yes '' and `` no '' where used in his works , but also in his later works he sometimes uses them in the modern way . 
  where was this , if i may ask ? 
   you can still hear the children playing a game crna kraljica jen , dva , tri ( black queen , one , two , three ) with one child acting as her majesty and others doing the peasants . 
  their goal is to approach her from behind and take over her place , but she must n't notice that they are moving when she turns around . 
  we have a variation of that game too , i guess it 's common throughout europe . 
  in our version it is a wolf instead of the black queen , but the rules remain the same . 
  here is a [ good overview ] ( http://www.speyer.de/sv_speyer/de/standort/stadtentwicklung/stadtmarketing/luftbild%20innenstadt.jpg ) of my hometown 's mediecal center . 
  the few remaining parts of the old wall would be just a bit under the edge of the image . 
  not sure if you could see them through the trees though . 
  also the small tower in that image , a bit to the right , next to that white building with the turquoise roof , is the last remaining city gate . 
  we used to have 4 of them , some got destroyed by the french , others were removed to make space for new houses . 
  then i might have some bad news for you ... 
  i 'd say the german equivalent would be `` asis '' ( sometimes written `` assis '' ) and `` hartzer '' . 
  the first term comes from `` asozial '' which means anitsocial , but not in the `` this kid is autistic '' - way , but more in deliberately not caring about social norms . 
  parking over two spaces could for example be called `` asozial '' . 
  the other term comes from hartz 4 , the long term unemployment aid programm . 
  it carries the stigma that people that get this kind of aid are lazy and do n't want to work , prefering to leech off society . 
  the stereotypcal look of such [ a person . 
  ] ( http://144.76.78.162/nb-town/lobbypics/33209_395.jpg ) notice the track suit , the stained wife beater and the can of beer as common elements in the depiction of `` asis '' and `` hartzer '' . 
  had a french girlfriend once . 
  the funny thing was , that i do n't speak french at all . 
  i had the option between french and latin in school , so the i went for the latter because `` roma aertana est '' . 
  anyway she could speak a little bit of german , but since she was from alsace it was generally easier to speak my local dialect to her , since it was closer to her interpretation of german . 
  but usually we would speak english . 
  we found out that her greatgrandmother was actually from my home town and married a french man . 
  it was a funny little coincidence . 
  anyway , we broke up , because visiting each other was too expensive and time consuming . 
  originally she wanted to move to germany , to live with me , but i told her without at least b1 german knowledge , finding a job here would be difficult , especially since she had no formal job training . 
  and me moving to france was no option either . 
  anyway , we are still friends . 
  she also found a new so , so i do n't have to worry about her being all alone . 
  never tried it . 
  my parents do n't like it , so we never had it at home and i never bought some myself , nor do i know anyone who did . 
  or atleast nobody ever offered me some . 
  my greatgrandfather apparently called all austrians `` nusser '' . 
  i do n't why , i only know that he called dead austrians `` erdnusser '' . 
  honestly i do n't know if schnapps really helps with digestion , i think it 's actually more one of those old household health tips your grandma knows . 
  and i think it 's , if at all , only true for herbal based schnapps . 
  and there it 's probably the herbs that do the trick , not the alcohol . 
   tihomir when i entered a thread about popular names today , i did n't expect to see one of my grandparents ' names , but there it is , my grandpa 's name . 
  yep , in german restaurants it 's not uncommon that the waiter will ask if you want some schnapps after a big meal . 
  you wont find [ that creature ] ( http://www.7lists.de/uploads/images/content/default/8113_0_elwetritsche3jp.jpg ) anywhere else but in the palatinate forest . 
  i pretty much drink no alcohol at all ( rarely a schnapps for digestion ) . 
  i just do n't like the taste and i do n't feel like i miss anything by never having been drunk . 
  the thread asked for unpopular opinions , so i gave mine . 
  i hate the taste of beer and coffee . 
  i have no idea why anybody would drink that stuff out their own volition . 
  i just bought another bank slot yesterday and the thing is already half full again . 
  [ why ca n't i hold all this loot ?

  i was about to write the same , until i saw this post . 
  by the way guys , halloween has started this year . 
  farm that maze like there is no tomorrow !, 
  we have a few , many of them , especially the older ones were animated in japan , so they are usually counted as german-japanse co-productions .
