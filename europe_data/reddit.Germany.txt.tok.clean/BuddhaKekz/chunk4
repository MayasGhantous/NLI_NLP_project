  excluding my native germany , i 've been to denmark , poland , czech republic , austria , switzerland , france , luxemburg , uk , spain , italy , vatican city , malta , tunesia , egypt , brazil , paraguay and now serbia . 
  light-years . 
  it 's 26 \u00b0 c right now , so it 's too bad here . 
  however i will be on vacation in the balkans this week and apparently it will be up 39 \u00b0 c there . 
  it was nice knowing all of you , please give me a nice respectful funeral and try to ignore my crispy baked body in the coffin . 
  my opinion ? 
  i think they are buffoons . 
  [ me irl ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/vfipsoeodjxfi/giphy.gif ), 
  these questions are so hard to answer for me , because i love so mayn games , but i 'll give it a try : ** nintendo ** : - most of the zelda games , but if i had to pick one : majora 's mask - super smash bros. series ( the original if i have to pick ) - mario kart ( double dash ) - golden sun ( 1 & 2 , never played 3 so far ) - pokemon ( emerald ) - metroid prime - paper mario ( 2 ) - mario & luigi : superstar saga ( the first one ) - donkey kong 64 ** pc ** : - thief ( 1 & 2 ) - total war ( rome ) - age of empires series ( 2 ) - age of mythology - guild wars 1 & 2 ( my favorite would be nightfall ) - dark messiah of might & magic ( sadly my copy was bugged , could never finish it t_t ) - elder scrolls series ( morrowind ) - baldur 's gate ( 2 ) - gothic ( 2 ) - fallout ( 2 and new vegas , like them both equally ) - warcraft 3 - overwatch - hearthstone ** multi-console/playstation ** : - metal gear solid ( twin snakes ) - dishonored - beyond good & evil - godzilla unleashed ( gameplay is n't stellar , but still one of the best big g games ) - mass effect - timesplitters ( 2 ) - red dead redemption i 'm sure i still forgot some . 
  are you sure they still do that ? 
  as far as i know deawoo and gm split and the car manufacturing part got rebranded as gm korea or something along those lines . 
   general motors is virtually unknown here well we do have opel and vauxhaul , who both for decades belonged to gm . 
  so the reason that you rarely see gm in europe , is that they are n't really sold here , only their aquired european brands were . 
  this is a moot point now though , since they both are owned by psa . 
  probably similar to what states in most federal republics do , they deal with local administration . 
  for example deciding how land should be used , will it be for agriculture , housing , industry , infrastructure and so on . 
  depending on the autonomy states can actually have a quite a range of decisions to make . 
  in germany for example , every state decides on education policy themselves ( and i 'm not a fan tbh ) . 
  they also have their own budget to manage and their own taxes to raise . 
  police forces are usually run by the states too , though there is also a federal police too . 
  well personally i think it would be best if a federal eu was split into states of roughly equal population . 
  however i do n't think this would ever happen , because people are way to attached to their nations . 
  i ca n't blame them , it was drilled into their lives that this is how things are supposed to be and they most do n't know it any other way . 
  so going from that , it might be more acceptable to most if the fromer nations become the states of the federation . 
  i think giving smaller subdivisions statehood might delude the federation too much , with too many small governments . 
  the 28 members of the union are already hard to coordinate , if you make several hundreds of them , it might be impossible to administer . 
  in fact i would rather fuse smaller nations together , like luxembourg to belgium . 
  though again , you 'll probably have resistance from people who fear that would somehow make them lose their identity . 
  in other words , there is no easy solution , it really depends on how , when and by whom such ideas are proposed . 
  it 's kohl , without the '' \u00f6 '' . 
  yeah i can agree with that . 
  as long as the cultural sector is added , like it was done right after conscription ended . 
  atleast in my bundesland , maybe others had the voluntary cultural year before/later . 
  what do you think about the end of conscription ? 
  i heard arguments that conscripts made sure the bundeswehr was made of a broad demographic , without it , the people enlisting are often more on the right wing spectrum . 
  personally i 'm glad it 's over , though i was still part of the last group that was examined for service . 
  fortunately i was deemed unfit . 
  we use it in all the forms mentioned by u/wurzn and one more : `` h\u00f6r auf eh du dir weh tust '' = stop before ( = eh ) you hurt yourself . 
  though i guess in this context it comes from the word `` ehe '' which means before , so it might be a different word that is just pronounced very similarly . 
  i never think i met anyone who thinks it 's an austrian thing , me included . 
  i and pretty much everbody i know use `` eh '' all the time . 
  i am from the southwest though , maybe they do n't use it in the north . 
  maybe this is common saying over there because a georgian friend of mine said the same thing . 
  as i said , the concept of monastaries is n't unique , but that does n't mean it would be reproduced 1 to 1 . 
  and considering how influential they were , especially in the early middle ages , even a slight change could cause great ripples . 
  imagine charlemagne 's son ludwig is not sent to a cloister , he in turn is n't as `` pious '' and thus does not support the spread of his religion and gives less authority to the mithras-cult in this case . 
  come to think there is also the possibility that mithraism would n't be so aggressive in converting pagans . 
  alteast during the time they were active they seemed a lot more `` live and let live '' than there christian counterparts . 
   `` same believe '' ? 
  ; you know how things are `` they use the wrong wood for the holy fire , they are devills , i rather go somewhere else '' hence i said * similar * belive . 
   in face of imidiate danger such squabbels are usually put to the sight , even if not for long . 
  i do n't doubt there would have been countless sects and movements too and maybe even purges . 
  still , going to stay with people that atleast share the basic ideas of your believe seems to be a safer bet than going to foreign lands with strange new believes of their own . 
  i think there would be more differences . 
  christianity , atleast in it 's early days was a religion for the common folk , while mithraism had a stronger following among the military . 
  this could have influence on the social economic structure in the long run . 
  on top , i doubt that monasteries like we know them would have appeared . 
  those structures were economically , culturally and even politically important through-out the middle ages . 
  without them there would n't have been a central place to learn reading and writing , there would n't have been a place for nobles to get rid off potential unwanted heirs and there would n't have been a place that keeps greek and roman philosophy alive until it is rediscovered by the public in the renaissance . 
  i mean maybe there would have been similar structures or places , but it is hard to say . 
  monastaries are not exclusively christian and other religions ( mainly islam ) also had centres for culture and learning . 
  still , history could be majorly altered by the lack of cloisters alone . 
  another interesting possibility is that persian philosophers and priests could have come to europe . 
  when the followers of mohammed attacked , the zoroastrian believers fled east to northern india , pakistan , afghanistan and some even made it to western china . 
  however , if people with a similar believe are to the west , why not go there and take your knowledge with you ? 
  those are just some things from the top of my head , there is probably more that would and could change . 
  sometimes i wonder what europe would look like if mithraism instead of christianity had become the dominant religion in the roman empire and the germanic kingdoms that followed it . 
   magine [ ... ] chancellor seehofer i think i threw up a little in my mouth . 
  reeeeeeeeeeee sorry old pf\u00e4lzer habit . 
  peace !, 
  it comes from yiddish \u201e hatslokhe u brokhe `` which in turn means `` success and blessing '' . 
  neither had a noticeable effect on my personal life , though trump is a never ending source of entertainment ... and dread . 
  because i only linked the ones i had heard before . 
  but after listening , i realize it 's a shame i did n't know it before . 
  that might be the best song ever written about lewwerworscht . 
  not my favorite bands/artists ( i actually do n't care much about music at all ) but here is some local music from my region that is played during every single festival/sport event you can imagine . 
  [ palzlied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilkklzzndqk ) ( = palatinate song ) [ wann ich ken p\u00e4lzer w\u00e4r ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmvrmb96lvw ) ( = if i was n't a palatinatian ) [ in de palz geht de parre mit de peif in de kerch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5prvhml75m ) ( = in the palatinate the priest takes his pipe ( for smoking ) to the church ) [ p\u00e4lzer bu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-stmp3kfta ) ( = palatinatian boy ), 
  i guess there are guys who do it but it is the minority . 
  still ca n't say the whole country has an attitude , it 's personal taste . 
  i do n't know enki/ninhursag is my otp . 
   you could call it the liftwife . 
  [ how about the staplerfahrer ?

  [ you know all the answers !, 
  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/ok27windqs5yq/giphy.gif ) do you happen to be a god ? 
  can i sacrifice in your name ? 
  that 's a relief . 
  now i can pick and choose like a window shopper . 
  i might go with enki next , because you never know when a mesopotamian river god might come in handy . 
  but what if tiwaz is my man ? 
  does it count if i sacrifice some goats to him instead ? 
  the man is pounding the lady from above like a jackhammer * , because even doing fun time we have to w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk .

  you know what , i think it was kreuzlingen . 
  it 's been almost 15 years now , so my memory is a little blurred . 
  well it was n't just a lady but a whole family that i can only describe as swiss hillbillies . 
  the hostel was more or less also a farm , with cows , goats , ducks and so on , so the cats were more like barn cats . 
  they had dogs too .
