  because they are national - ** socialists !, 
  sch\u00e4uble is the prime example of a bitter old man . 
  i mean , i get that being shot at , is not a pleasent experience , especially not if it cripples you for life . 
  but still , that guy would give ebenezer scrooge a run for his money . 
  if he could steal christmas , i have no doubt he would . 
  you break my tiny mechanized heart :(, 
  i 'm currently learning portuguese . 
  my brazilian relatives do n't speak any german and most of them do n't speak english either , so learning portuguese is my best bet to be able to communicate with them . 
  so far my father is the only one on the german side to speak portuguese somewhat fluently , but he wont be around forever and i 'd to just lose contact over a language barrier . 
  on top i also need another modern foreign language for my master degree , so there 's that consideration too . 
  in school i also learned latin , because i knew i was going to study history or archeology one day and it is required for both . 
  i also really love the roman empire , so it did n't bother me much . 
  i always got good grades just through my knowledge of roman history . 
  my translation where pretty bad most of the time . 
  i like the sentiment but this is pretty cringey to be honest . 
  i mean one of them is named `` gamsbart '' ( `` goatie '' ) . 
  the fuck ? 
  man , why does it always have to be `` your country '' . 
  all i want to say is bronze age mediterranean . 
  if it has to be about germany though , i 'd say the early to high middle ages . 
  so everything from charlemagne to frederick ii ( the hr-emperor , not the prussian king ) . 
  they have a lot of good stuff . 
  like their tv spot during the federal elections in 2013 , dubbed `` family policies '' . 
  [ spoiler : it 's two people having sex .

  i also like their comment that they would build a coalition with everybody , except the fdp , since they do n't want to work with `` gag parties '' . 
  ( the fpd was called gag party in the 90 's and early 2000 's because their election strategy was more focused on entertainment than substance ) . 
  well dutch belongs to the frankish dialects , as does mine . 
  different sub-groups of course ( low franconian and rhine franconian respectively ) but still part of the same general direction . 
  dialects are ment to be spoken though , not written . 
  there is n't even a standard writing form for most of them , so do n't get hung up on that . 
  that 's normal . 
  vorderpf\u00e4lzisch and hessisch are pretty similar . 
  i doubt it . 
  the view of a 20-something academic would be more accurate . 
  but i usually also preface my posts with words that indicate that i 'm giving my own opinion , which i think not only differes from the average german , at times it even contradicts it outright . 
  i hate the taste of beer for example . 
  fight me irl . 
  * puts aside war and peace * heh , reading is for nerds !, 
  belgium and luxembourg are atleast as pro-eu as germany , if not more so . 
  * hides bachelor degree in history . 
  * oh you know , it 's a bit of an hobby of mine . 
  i tried a lot , but i do n't remember which had what taste . 
  aside from what the others said , he is basically a minor deity in the palatinate .

   vegeta is it the prince of all saiyans ? 
  maybe it 's because i tasted it first , but all other brands that i tried are either to sweet or too nutty . 
  nutella is just the perfect balance . 
  though it does taste slightly different from country to country . 
  italian and german nutella are the best i 've tasted yet , but i also liked danish and french nutella . 
  so impactful he got weather named after him : [ fritz walter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritz_walter ), 
  wait ... you like the sound of german ? 
  [ you ... you ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gziyviyjndw ) ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  to me neither , european portuguese sounds similar to greek to me . 
  brazilian portuguese , which i 'm more familiar with , sounds a bit like slow italian ( if it 's even possible to speak italian slowly ) . 
  we started with british english in 5th grade and starting in 7th grade we could choose wether we use british or american english ourselves . 
  the only obligation was that we stayed consistant , so no using the word `` lift '' but then go on and write `` color '' without the `` u '' . 
  most of my teachers continued using british english , though we did have an american woman as an additional teacher ( it was some kind of exchange program , she teached alongside our actual teacher , because she did not have the legal right to teach on her own without having a german teaching degree ) . 
  as soon as i could i chose american english , because i 'm lazy and the american words are on average shorter ( or so it seems to me ) . 
  on top , i never got the hang of british pronunciation . 
  ae feels `` flatter '' to me , while be comes more from deep down . 
  i ca n't really reproduce those sounds . 
  on top of that , that was around the time i started watching a lot of videos/shows/movies in english and most of them were in ae , so i also got more used to hearing and understanding it . 
  it has nothing to do with pronouncing my name , it 's just that my character 's name was readable ingame , while my real name was used in ts ( and even then behind my character 's name , so : buddhakeks | my first name ) . 
  so in those first 2 weeks of being in the guild they just called me by the monks name because they could easily see in mid-combat , whereas they would have had tab out to read my real name . 
  you could argue that they could have just forced themselves to use my real name , so they do n't forget it in the heat of the battle , but they did n't . 
  i did n't really mind either . 
  story time !, 
  ( i feel like i told this story atleast twice on reddit before and a bunch of time on other forums , but i never get tired of it ) . 
  back in the early 2000 's we had a comedy show on german tv called `` was guckst du ?! '', 
  ( roughly `` whatcha lookin ' at ?! '' ) . 
  the host kaya yanar was a turco-arab who grew up in germany and basically made fun of immigrant stereotypes , mostly about turkish people . 
  one part of the programm was prop comedy . 
  so in one of those segments he held up a pack of `` buddhakekse '' , a pun on butterkekse ( shortbread biscuits ) . 
  the image of the smiling buddha ( it was the fat chinese buddha iirc ) made me laugh so hard i actually fell out of my armchair . 
  do n't judge me , i was a teenager . 
  anyway , a few months later i made a new character in guild wars , a monk . 
  while they are straight up healers , they resemble shaolin monks visually . 
  so i made a character that looked like chinese buddha ( minus the belly , you could n't make characters fat ) and named him buddha keks . 
  fast forward a year later , i started playing pvp and eventually joined a pvp guild . 
  they needed a backliner ( traditionally the backline was a healer and a `` protter '' / protective spell user , the latter was my new job ) so i busted out my trusted monk . 
  now the guild had a policy to use your real first name in chat/team speak , which i did , but in the heat of the battle my new guildies just could n't remember my first name , so they said `` buddha keks '' instead . 
  eventually they just said buddha . 
  and it became my nickname . 
  they even gave me shit once for not using my real name , to which i reminded them , that i did , but they could n't be bothered to use it . 
  they abolished the rule after that short discussion . 
  anyway , i stayed with this guild for a year , then it broke apart and i formed a new one with some of the guys . 
  the tradition to call me by nickname instead of real name continued . 
  in fact some of those guys regularly forget my real name to this day , because they are so used to only use `` buddha '' . 
  seeing as this was the name most people recognized me by , i started using it for other games , usually just as my account name though , not as my character 's name . 
  in some games `` buddhakeks '' with an `` s '' was already taken , so i had to swap it with a `` z '' , which i liked enough to exclusively use it some point . 
  there you have it , the story of my username . 
   9gag ( yeah , i use that site and it used to be pretty funny actually ) burn the heretic !, 
  ahem ... excuse me , i needed to get that out first . 
  like the others said , the majority of users are from the us and english speaking europeans . 
  of course you also find australians and canadians , as well as other non-native english speakers , but by numbers alone americans and europeans dwarf anything else . 
  so naturally those two groups are the loudest . 
  another part is this tribal mentality , the group dynamic . 
  you just need something in common with a lot of people , that also sets you apart from a lot of people and there you have it , two sides fighting over which is better .
