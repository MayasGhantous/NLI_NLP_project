  whether this denominator is the continent you are from , the country , your favorite soft drink or even how you put up a roll of toilet paper , it does n't matter . 
  groups will always find something to fight about now as long as it does n't get too toxic ( like the `` nuke this place '' comments ) , i do n't think there is too much of a problem . 
  if people approach it in a tongue in cheek way , like some harmless banter , it even adds too the community . 
  and personally i think that young people on the internet start to identify themselves more and more as european , even just to set themselves apart from americans , is n't a bad development . 
  just keep it civil . 
   they have one , i visited it . 
  [ ours is older . 
  * laughs in salian . 
  pfff , those guys with their tiny unimpressive cathedral would never be able to preserve a mikveh through the centuries . 
  roughly 3300 in my state , rhineland-palatinate . 
  atleast that 's the number of members of the central council of jews of rhineland-palatinate . 
  so it might actually be more . 
  it 's still a far cry from what it was , especially in the middle ages , when my hometown was on of the centers of jewish culture , with a large population and scholars coming from far and wide to study with our philosophers and savants here . 
  still , we have a rather new synagoge ( sanctified in 2011 ) and we still have our medieval mikveh , one of the oldest still standing ones in europe ( today it 's a museum of course ) . 
  i ca n't tell you how * i * get along with them , since i have n't really spoken with any . 
  atleast not to my knowledge . 
  however my hometown is very proud to have a small but thriving jewish community once again . 
  and so far , i have n't heard of any anti-semitic incidents in the town .

  at my school 's graduation , there was no dresscode . 
  most people wore suits/dresses though . 
  some just appeared in jeans and t-shirts . 
  one of my friends for example . 
  he was also high as a kite . 
  i wore a suit because my mother insisted . 
  i looked like a used car salesman with my devilish grin on the graduation photo . 
  [ why stop there ?

  this . 
  i slur my words in any language and have a very slight lisp . 
  i 'd still say my english is pretty good , but there are some words i just ca n't pronounce like `` enthusiasm '' . 
  it comes out as `` enthfsusiasm '' . 
  words with `` th '' after `` n '' in general are a bitch to articulate . 
  i was part of the last grade-group that did n't have to learn english in elementary , but they already offered it while i was in 3rd grade . 
  i know that because we once had a substitute teacher who was freshly hired to teach english . 
  so that 's what she did with us in the lesson . 
  in my opinion it was better than singing , the usual '' occupational therapy '' the substitute teachers would go too . 
  but people called for her resignment after the election , even some of her own party members . 
  would n't she have taken the opportunity if she wants to retire ? 
  i think they start even earlier nowadays . 
  like in elementary already , so grade 3-4 . 
  and choosing french or latin , atleast in my age came in grade 7 , though it might have changed ( or be different from state to state ... ) . 
  some schools also start with french in elementary , not sure if it is instead of english or alongside it . 
  others , so called `` humanistische gymnasien '' , focus more on latin and ancient greek , but you still learn english there . 
  that bavaria is somehow different from the rest of germany is only believed by foreigners and bavarians . 
  in the former 's case i think i understand why . 
  when german stereotypes are shown they are usually acutally bavarian stereotypes . 
  cue ( non-bavarian ) germans complaining that this depicts bavrian culture not german culture . 
  so foreigners think : `` oh bavaria must be very different from the rest . '', 
  it is n't helped by the bavarian special snowflake syndrom which they often propagate ( not all of you bavarians , but many of you ) . 
  the thing is , germany is made up out of a whole lot of different cultures that came together under the umbrella of being `` german '' , whatever that actually means . 
  ( ca n't be language , because standard german was conceived after the common identity was already formed ) . 
  in fact i , as a palatinatian , have culturally more in common with a bavarian ( or austrian for that matter ) than with anyone in northern germany , yet the difference to the bavarian culture is still so glaringly obvious that you could never mistake them . 
  so in other words , austria as a german state would not be the odd one out . 
  it 's regional differences are not greater than those inside germany . 
  and i know austrians love to bring up the slavic influence , but even that we have in germany too . 
  i mean even our capital has a slavic name and the whole south west is filled with french influence while the north ( west ) has dutch and scandinavian written all over it . 
  so even in that regard , it is nothing special . 
  them being a sovereign nation is just a historical development . 
  nothing to brag about , nothing to get angry about . 
  it 's just the way it is and i see nothing wrong with it . 
  a marius vs. sulla show would be fantastic . 
  or what about a show set in the year of the four emperors ? 
  you got everything from slighty insane nero , over oldfart galba , to party dude otho and fat blob vitellius to finally the cunning vespasian . 
  shows about rome ( you know like `` rome '' from hbo ) are often so unnessecarily reduced to caesar/augustus when some real interesting stuff happened before and after them too . 
  same here , except we went into a little more detail on the medieval jewish life , since i 'm from a town which was one of the centers of jewish science , philosophy , commerce and culture in the middle ages . 
  for example we went to our still standing `` mikwe '' , the jewish ritual bath , on a school trip . 
  we also have a brand new temple ( well 10 years old now ) and a growing jewish population . 
  we also have a partnership with the israeli town yavne , which is thriving to this day . 
  there are many historical events and characters that are completely untouched by hollywood , most of the ones i 'd really love too see are n't related to german history though ( seriously hollywood make a show about alexander the great 's successors , that is some got shit ! ) . 
  anyway , i think a movie about arminius could be fun . 
  just do n't make him some kind of freedom fighter like the 19th century nationalist . 
  he is more of a cunning power hungry character , as he tried to establish his own little kingdom with his win over the romans . 
  at the same time , varus was no villain . 
  i know , expecting a nuanced picture is a bit much from hollywood , but one can dream . 
  i 'm too complacent to migrate but both my grandfathers did . 
  on my father 's side : germany \u2192 brazil \u2192 germany on my mother 's side : serbia \u2192 bosnia ( when it was part of the austrian empire ) \u2192 france \u2192 germany, 
  thank you , after my time machine malfunctioned i really was n't sure ~ ~ where ~ ~ when i ended up . 
  i did n't know that knappen means miners in that case . 
  always wondered why they are associated with chivalry . 
  that makes sense now . 
  also just for hell of it a few more fantasy club names : eintracht braunschweig : [ the braunschweig lions ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/choreo_l%c3%b6we_braunschweig.jpg ) , because you can never have enough lions . 
  karlsruher sc : [ the karlsruhe boars/wild hogs ] ( http://www.mopo.de/image/6320126/max/1920/1080/27c9070d43e0a1d810479e92a2a1ea2d/nz/williwildparkksc-jpg.jpg ) , because sending talented players there is like pearls before the sows . 
  / s no it 's because of the wildparkstadion . 
  this is a tough one . 
  their logo shows a bear , which is the symbol of berlin , but their nickname is `` die eisernen '' because they were a metalworkers club and their mascot is `` ritter keule '' , a knight . 
  i 'd go with berlin knights myself . 
  * fc kaiserslautern : [ kaiserslautern red devils ] ( http://fck.de/fileadmin/dam/galerien/news/fans/2012_08_august/21_meldung/betzi.jpg ) . 
  from the nickname , which they got from playing furios like red devils . 
  though i 'd rather go with leipzig cunts . 
  that would make for a good mascot too . 
  * had to leave the `` 1 . '', 
  out , due to formatting . 
  no we never learned about the states in school , only about countries . 
  but even than we only ever did a country test on europe and south america ( probably because one is our home and the other is one of the easiest continents to remember ) . 
  however i did play stronghold kingdoms a few years ago , which was a browser game with maps based on modern depictions of countries ( which does n't make sense at all ... but whatever ) . 
  one of the maps i played on was the us map . 
  so i basically looked at the states every day for a view months . 
  the rest of the good result comes from the names of the states flashing up when you click the wrong one .
