  [ you task me . 
  you task me and i shall have you !, 
  i 'll chase you ` round the moons of nibia and ` round the antares maelstrom and ` round perdition 's flames before i give you up !, 
   body only shower after talking a dump . 
  what if you are going on a public toilet/plane/train / friend 's house ? 
  really depends on the family . 
  i think most germans also shower every day , or atleast would n't have said anything about it . 
  i even agree with them that it 's unnecessary but i would n't have said anything . 
  even if you are wasting my water ... stop wasting my water !, 
  ahem ... 
  i mean ... nevermind . 
  damn , you are 1cm taller than me . 
  you are on my enemy list now !, 
  well most depictions of the judeo-christian god are based on the zeus/jupiter . 
  aside from that there are a lot of companies using names and symbols from the olympians like nike , [ goodyear ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/thumb/b/b6/goodyear_tire_%26_rubber_company_logo.svg/1024px-goodyear_tire_%26_rubber_company_logo.svg.png ) or [ venus ] ( https://www.ruhanirabin.com/userfiles/2011/12/venus-250x250.jpg ) . 
  in germany pharmacies also use [ this symbol ] ( http://static1.squarespace.com/static/539588d4e4b045b0b0465b2d/t/54aef13fe4b0ac54b0f1b3d2/1483016009457/?format=1500w ) which shows an aesculapian snake . 
  do n't confuse it with the [ caduecus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/us_army_medical_corps_branch_plaque.gif ) which is a symbol of hermes . 
  every 2-3 days . 
  i do n't sweat that much and showering too often is n't good for your skin . 
  the natural oil helps keeping bacteria and viruses out , no need to destroy this useful barrier every 24 hours . 
  [ all i can think off when hearing a french accent in german . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eram9y_rhvq ), 
  not sure how it 's now , but i think basketball used to be more popular than ice hockey . 
  there is also field hockey , though probably not as popular as either of the other two . 
  all of them are far behind handball , which itself is far behind football . 
  i have a pretty good to very detailed understanding of the history of most european nations . 
  though i know the least about the baltics and some of the smaller states/micronations like luxembourg , andorra , monaco and san marino . 
  `` ossis '' no , not sure . 
  it really depends on the political leaning of the speaker . 
  `` gutmensch '' ( `` good person '' ) and `` weltverbesserer '' ( someone who makes the world better ) are both used highly sarcarstically by more right wing people . 
  there is also `` linksgr\u00fcn-versifft '' , which is probably the closest to sjw we have . 
  in turn those people are called `` pegidas '' ( after the demonstraters from dresden ) or `` putinversteher '' ( people who understand/like putin ) . 
  * * edit : forgot to mention : putinversteher is also commonly used for the party die linke ( the left ) , because they frequently sided with putin in the past and are generally very against nato . 
  beer , coffee , cars , sauerkraut and i 'm also not the biggest fan of pork , but i can eat it . 
  there is a reason most people question my nationality . 
  i 'm literally watching it for the first time in my life right now , because i 'm on vacation and it 's on dw . 
  well `` watching '' because i 'm actually browsing reddit and it is on in the background . 
  it seems pretty gay and i do n't mean that in a negative way . 
  it is just ... gay . 
  all correctly except the last part . 
  henry iv simply removed gregory and replaced him with clement iii , who was later replaced by urban ii who was again an enemy of henry . 
  but he in turn was replaced by paschal ii , who while also banning henry was compeled to work for the emperor by an army showing up in his front yard . 
  so the idea to stop the emperor from naming his own bishops was executed at times , ultimately the popes had not enough power to prevent it . 
  that 's why i think you can call it a victory for henry , in the end he got what he wanted . 
  however ist is true that a precident was set . 
  as i said the conflict went on and in the end it just fizzled out . 
  german migrants were for the most part from the rhine valley . 
  they were farmers in one of most fertile parts of the hre . 
  however since the region was so fertile it also took the brunt of the thirty years war . 
  so there were pretty much not many options besides getting slaughtered and migrating . 
  after this initial wave , the region was hit by a potatoe plague , so even more farmers went elsewhere . 
  then napoleon came and you guessed it , people went away again . 
  not only to america btw , russia and balkans also attracted rhine valley farmers . 
  of course there is also the family and friends effect , where migrants wrote letters home about how great the new land is . 
  this motivated the next wave . 
  eventually germany was united though , from that point on farmers stayed in the country , there was no need to emigrate . 
  now it was more intellectuals that went overseas , especially jews . 
  wwi and it 's consequences brought a lot of workers , mostly miners to the us ( and south america , like my own grandfather ) . 
  and then it was jews again , i do n't think i have to explain , who they were escaping from . 
  so no , i do n't think any of them were losers , most of them fled war , poverty and persecution . 
  of course there also was the post-wwii brain drain but that is a different story from normal migration . 
  interestingly enough the actual `` gang nach canossa '' was not born from henry iv regretting anything , it was a smart move which bought hin enough time to defeat bis internal political enemies , before coming back for the pope with force . 
  the way the story is taught in schools makes you think him kissing the popes feet is the end of the affair , when in reality henry just kept doing what he was doing before and in a way actually `` won '' that conflict . 
  ( well in the end no one won , the conflict went in for hundreds of years , until it just lost importance ), 
  huh , did n't know we had such paranoid parents . 
  i guess they still a minority though , or so i hope atleast . 
  in which country did this happen ? 
  i could n't have said it better . 
  the eu seems to be the closest we have ever gotten to a star trek like federation . 
  i hope we continue down this way . 
  engage !, 
  yes !, 
  in fact i think ist is a necessity if we want to keep our standart of living . 
  with giants like the us , china , russia and potential new powers like india , brazil and south africa , we ca n't allow ourself to be divided . 
  nationalist talk about making their countries relevant again by leaving the eu or halting european integration , but they are doing the exact opposite . 
  only together can wenn defend our interests in an increasingly multipolar world . 
  dutch can easily pass as a german dialect . 
  you just have to constantly look annoyed while talking and you are good to go . 
  psssst i almost had him , do n't ruin it now . 
  do n't mind the talking goat , taking saarland is a great deal . 
  i even throw ludwigshafen in too !, 
  a whole bundesland and a city , i must be crazy !, 
  this is a limited edition , better take them now . 
  and take saarland in return . 
  it 's barely used , as good as new . 
  but buy some nutella when you 're here . 
  buy some if you ever get to italy or germany . 
  it tastes very different , more chocolaty . 
  different countries also have different tastes , danish nutella for example seemed more nutty . 
  because it does n't taste good . 
  i had for the first time last year , friends from the us brought some and proclaimed that this will be the start of a life long addiction . 
  so i tried it , thought it would be sweet , but it was n't . 
  tried with jelly too , it 's better but the tasty part is the jelly , not the pb . 
  i do n't why i would every eat that stuff over the glorious taste of heaven that is nutella . 
  if foreigners find out i 'm german quite a few call me nazi in jest . 
  now i know it 's a joke and i do n't mind personally but i still wish people would stop doing that or at least wait until they know such jokes are okay . 
  not everyone is like me , some people will be upset if you call them nazi for no reason and technically it is discrimination . 
  also when you travel to non-eu countries you often get an extra queue for eu passports . 
  they just take a quick look and let you through , while non-eu queue barely moved at all . 
  speak for yourself barbarian , while i enjoy civilization , wine and plumbing on the good side of the limes .
