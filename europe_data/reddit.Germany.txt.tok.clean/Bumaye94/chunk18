  [ i actually like that one a day or so after charlie hebdo . 
   do n't try to ` culturize ' it with people from other continents . 
  am i the only one who finds this super funny ? 
  that guy is hungarian , his own people originally come from yugra in asia . 
  if they were n't allowed to culturize the carpathian basin his precious hungary would not even exist ... 
  when did she invited refugees ? 
  please show me the quote . 
  i would love to see it . 
  because there was non as far as i know . 
  i am by no means a merkel supporter but this narrative pushed by sputnik , breitbart and others that merkel called for syrians to come is nothing but fake news as far as i 'm aware . 
  she said things like that the german constitution knows no limits for asylum seekers and that she wo n't be ashamed for the fact that germany is being friendly . 
  she was welcoming but she did n't invited anyone . 
  not just the fact that anatolia itself is not really europe . 
  turks are not even indo-european people unlike for example kurds and persians . 
  plus you have already mentioned the huge cultural differences . 
  i mean muslims can still be europeans ( bosniaks for example ) but it 's quite obviously something different with a much deeper middle eastern connection here . 
  just because they live close to us nowadays does n't make turkey a european country . 
  it 's a weird trend right now that nobody really mentioned yet . 
  with the rise of the far-right around the world and the afd in germany a lot more people feel the need to vote again . 
  all the recent state elections had rising turnouts . 
  it turns out most of them are cdu voters . 
  the biggest swing of voters was n't spd to cdu or protest votes from pirateparty to afd but former non-voters who voted cdu this time . 
  half a million of them as expected at the moment . 
  the spd is doing an overall decent job imho but they fail to deliver their successes to the voters . 
  their campaign was complete shit . 
  also they kinda lack coalition partners . 
  they arguably lost the state election in saarland because centrist voters feared that the spd would build a coalition with die linke . 
  the greens are horribly unpopular at the moment as well . 
  and if they turn towards the fdp they will lose a lot of voters from the left part of their base towards die linke . 
  nothing 's ever gon na stop mutti . 
  she could shoot somebody on 5th avenue and would n't lose voters . 
   universal healthcare , maternal leave and so on are all given , as are abortion rights , recognition of climate change , secular society and so on . 
  the afd questions almost all of that afaik . 
   i am wondering has the views towards the uk changed since brexit ? 
  there are statistics here in germany every now and then about which partners germans trust . 
  the uk fell from 80 % support to 58 % after their decision . 
   what are your favourite songs from that ? 
  ( any year ) * [ emmelie de forest - only teardrops ( denmark ) 2013 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k59e7t0h-us ) * [ loreen - euphoria ( sweden ) 2012 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfo-8z86x80 ) * [ aysel & arash - always ( azerbaijan ) 2009 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hma82dli-pc ) * [ bojana stamenov - beauty never lies ( serbia ) 2015 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c40kvkiopve ) * [ sunstroke project & olia tira - run away ( moldova ) 2010 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-vmholcyw8 ) i do n't wan na hear anything about it before it , i do n't wan na hear about it afterwards but for that one evening every year it 's fabulous . 
  i even bought a relatively expensive bottle of wine for tonight . 
  i heavily prefer an eu army . 
  i mean ignoring russia for a moment the biggest threats for us right now are probably the crazy fools in washington and ankara , our nato allies . 
  which is more acceptable differs from country to country . 
  the problem i see is that we all of a sudden would be a military super power . 
  our active personal would surpass the us 's , our military expenditures would surpass china 's or still come close even if we take out britain . 
  most people want a defensive military not an interventionist one like the us or russia . 
  another problem is that it would be a lose of sovereignty which a lot of people oppose . 
  quite a few like the eu as it is as an economical and monetary union but do n't wan na give up more of their national sovereignity . 
  one of the most used brexit slogans was `` taking back our country '' or `` regaining our independence '' . 
  i think an eu army will definitely be a thing in the future but it wo n't happen in the next 15 years . 
  * 2010 gdp per capita of syria : 2918.1 * 2010 gdp per capita of ukraine : 2.965,1 so it is kinda weird . 
  though maybe it 's because of how uneven syria is . 
  in terms of wealth the rich western cities like latakia , tartus , aleppo and so on were probably on the same level as serbia or macedonia . 
  bloody hell , i forgot luxembourg . 
  i actually could have done quite a bit more . 
  the revolution , the different republics , vichy , brands , artists , former presidents , avignon and so on . 
  i guess there is no foreign country besides syria that i know more about then france . 
  some of the best football players of all times ( zidane , henry , platini , etc. 
  ) , our best friends after being our most hated enemy for centuries , macron pr\u00e9sident , hollande fucked up , biggest cities paris , marseille , lyon , lille and nice , target of some of the worst islamic terror attacks in the west , partners in building airbus aircrafts , monaco is about to win the french title without being french , napoleon , charlemagne , basically germanic/frankish people who decided that latin languages are cooler , biggest jewish community in europe nowadays , some major minorities like bretons , basques and corsicans , permanent member of the un security council , lots of former colonies and still some overseas territories like martinique , r\u00e9union , new caledonia and french guyana , treaty of versailles , louvre , notre dame , eifel tower , the mont blanc is the highest mountain in the eu , founding eu member , very secular tradition , quite impressive protest culture , great at handball , borders seven nations , the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean , produces some of the best wine and cheese in the world , people are n't the best english speakers , ... alright , let 's stop here . 
   macron has a tough 5 years ahead of him , with a probably fractured parliament . 
  actually the latest [ seat projection by opinionway ] ( https://www.opinion-way.com/fr/component/edocman/?task=document.viewdoc&amp;id=1618&amp;itemid=0 ) shows a big chance for macron 's en marche to reach an absolute majority . 
  and if not they can probably work something out with udi or ps . 
  this is cheap to be honest . 
  is germany a united country ? 
  well of course , right ? 
  but only 14,9 million people voted for merkel 's cdu last election which is just 24 % of the electorate . 
  alright , alright . 
  they are in a coalition with csu and spd so let 's add their votes . 
  so merkel had 29,4 million votes behind her but - that 's still only 47,5 % of the electorate . 
  barely more then macron got . 
   woth the exception of marseille i think , which was only 66-33 ( the national average ) which is still a landslide . 
  but no , he was a little worse in nice which went 60-40 . 
  [ france24 ] ( http://graphics.france24.com/results-second-round-french-presidential-election-2017/ ), 
  thanks remind me bot , you are bae . 
  so / u/snyggkille , who of us was in denial again ? 
  the urban divide is still a thing . 
  for example this is macron 's numbers in the 4 largest places in aisne , the d\u00e9partement where le pen got her best results : * saint-quentin : 57,08 % * soissons : 58,36 % * laon : 57,66 % * ch\u00e2teau-thierry : 62,48 % and those are not even major urban areas , just towns with 15.000 to 55.000 people . 
  or when we take something more urban in the northern regions let 's look at cities compared to the department results ( always from macron 's perspective ) : * lille : 78,27 % / nord : 56,90 % * amiens : 72,63 % / somme : 54,22 % * strasbourg : 81,24 % / bas-rhin : 63,07 % * metz : 71,89 % / moselle : 57,66 % * nancy : 81,35 % / meurthe-et-moselle : 60,66 % i do n't think le pen won a single city with more then 100.000 inhabitants . 
  fear is easy to sell . 
  most people who have a basic understanding of french politics have said for months that le pen has no chance whatsoever . 
  she had basically perfect circumstances with the ps imploding and lr nominating a dumpster fire and yet she got no-where close and could n't even win the 1st round . 
  the only thing i feared was a le pen vs. m\u00e9lenchon run-off . 
  two people openly discussing france leaving the eu would have been horrible . 
  yeah right , because macron would have reached the 2nd round without actually running a campaign . 
  60.14 % for macron in nice . 
  several recent islamic terror attacks , the biggest refugee crisis in modern history , a complete dumpster fire as now former president , low turnout because of a pissed of left , ridiculously high unemployment rates and as opponent a rothschild banker who fucks his teacher , never ran for office and does n't have the backing of any major party . 
  it were basically the perfect circumstances for fn and le pen did n't even got close . 
  4 days, 
  trump always was in striking distance and yet he could n't win the popular vote . 
  the advantage macron has is worlds larger then the one hillary had . 
  she was behind by 20 points before the debate so she needed quite a big win to have a chance on sunday . 
  instead she probably lost a couple points . 
  also it 's kinda his only option if he wants to stay `` neither right nor left '' in public . 
  s&p would make them nothing but a ps surrogate and non else fits their profile . 
  though i 'd say en march would be on the left end of alde . 
  i could joke about this gif but to be fair witchcraft is probably le pen 's last possible path to victory . 
  which i mentioned is n't that big of a deal in times when a lot of jobs will be done by robots and other machines . 
  i mean we are talking about 83 years ahead . 
  compare our current productivity with 83 years ago . 
  we simply do n't need three workers anymore to feed one senior . 
  the prognosis you 're trying to defend expects a positive net migration into both bulgaria and romania .
