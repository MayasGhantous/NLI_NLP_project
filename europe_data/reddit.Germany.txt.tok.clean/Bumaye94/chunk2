   migrants being allowed to move across borders with basically no checks is totally inexcusable and a total break down of system no , that is one of the most basic purposes and goals of the european union in the first place . 
  from the maastricht treaty :  resolved to facilitate the free movement of persons , while ensuring the safety and security of their peoples , by establishing an area of freedom , security and justice , in accordance with the provisions of this treaty ,  resolved to continue the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of europe , in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ,  in view of further steps to be taken in order to advance european integration ,  have decided to establish a european union and to this end have designated as their plenipotentiaries, 
  so around 1/6 of what germany spents . 
  britain stronk . 
  oh no , people do n't want to stay in xenophobic and economical shitholes but in places where the majoritty is helpful and they see a better future for their children . 
  those animals !, 
  greece does n't even have jobs for themselves , we have 500.000 jobs open right now . 
  you think a refugee camp in turkey is save ? 
  lol will be a nice winter for little children in these tents there . 
  you know how much they get ? 
  143 $ per month . 
  the trip costs more than they get here . 
  they are even a member of the alerta network . 
  oh there are some left . 
  eintracht frankfurt who chanted `` nazi pigs ! '', 
  against dresden . 
  hansa rostock who punched the nazi-leader udo past\u00f6rs out of the stadium . 
  hannover 96 who attacked l\u00fcbeck fans after racist chants . 
  who have shown several antifascist banners in the past . 
  dresden and cottbus are the only bigger ultra groups that i would describe as right wing and then some smaller ones like lok leipzig and bfc dynamo . 
  as a german it made me really really proud to see the people in budapest chanting `` germany !, 
  germany ! '', 
  it is maybe a little complex thanks to our history that we want to be loved . 
  nevertheless let them come . 
  we plan to pay 6 billion euro this year for asylum seekers . 
  we paid 184 billion euro in 2008-2010 to `` fix '' the financial crisis . 
  we can deal with that . 
   we 've gone through much harder times in europe during our history so get a grip . 
  this !, 
  after the war the population of mecklenburg-vorpommern doubled . 
  now we cry because of a plus of 1 % . 
   we instead are becoming the most racist country in europe . 
  hungary and poland are trying there best to stay on top . 
   it 's fine for a country to not take on tens/hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers if public opinion supports this . 
  no , it 's not . 
  asylum is a human right and all of our countries singed the geneva conventions . 
  so you 're a `` volk ohne raum '' . . ? 
  but you did n't helped to create and preserve the crisis . 
  i tell you it 's 15 generations of incest up there . 
  as a leftist myself i would argue that the attack on the police station in leipzig-connewitz a few weeks ago was terrorism . 
  maybe even the occupy frankfurt riots . 
  i think the definition of terrorism is pretty vague . 
  anarchist groups still produce some problems and are sometimes violent ( against others than the neo-nazis ) and that is a problem but not a major thing like the uprising nazi-terrorism .

  nothing spectacular but more than a hut for a dog . 
  rostock , germany . 
  a nice upper middle class house like this one in decent suburb : * [ house ] ( http://images.immonet.de/00/60/49/357006049_427x342.jpg ) * [ bathroom ] ( http://images.immonet.de/00/60/54/357006054_456x299.jpg ) * [ kitchen ] ( http://images.immonet.de/00/60/55/357006055_456x299.jpg ) * [ living room ] ( http://images.immonet.de/00/60/52/357006052_456x299.jpg ), 
  as conservative politicians always ask when people are against states saving our data : why do you keep secrets ? 
  do you have something to hide ? 
  by pure luck , that 's the point . 
   if you live in a country , you 're contributing one way or another to it . 
  so i am proud of my contribution , not of that of all germans . 
  `` i am proud to be german !, 
  it 's the country of goethe , schiller and beethoven ! '', 
  `` what about hitler and the nazis ? '', 
  `` that was before my time , it 's not my fault what my grandfather did !! 1 ! '', 
  interestingly enough most big german minds like goethe , mann , heine , marx , schopenhauer or adorno were big critics of patriotism and nationalism . 
  no , not at all . 
  you can just be proud of your own accomplishments , being proud of the luck to be born in germany instead of somalia is just stupid to me . 
  or to quote george bernard shaw :  patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all others because you were born in it, 
   and the spd is n't in a position to challenge her at the moment . 
  there is right now a majority of spd , greens and the left . 
  of course they can challenge it . 
  by the way something like that is actually not new . 
  a couple years ago people wanted to protest in front of the private house of klaus wowereit , the former major of berlin against the new airport . 
  the judges forbid it because every one needs to have a private retreat . 
  for asylum seekers that are obviously those centers . 
  there is also a petition for the same matter : https://www.change.org/p/f%c3%bcr-ein-verbot-fremdenfeindlicher-demos-vor-fl%c3%bcchtlingsheimen-heimeohnehass?source_location=trending_petitions_home_page&amp;algorithm=curated_trending, 
  for the refugees it would to a certain extend . 
  we currently have an attack every day on asylum seekers , often after demonstration . 
  if it can prevent some of these attacks it is a good thing . 
  why yemen ?!, 
  mecklenburg-vorpommern is barely behind panama and serbia , that sounds much better than yemen . 
  you forgot to offer tr\u00f6glitz, 
   2 ) the spanish political mainstream refuses to acknowledge catalonia as its own political entity separated from the rest i 'm curious : what is podemos thinking about it ? 
  i do n't think it is odd . 
  i try it with an example . 
  let 's take the shipyard in stralsund ( german baltic sea coast ) . 
  for us in vorpommern it is really important that it wo n't close . 
  we are economically the weakest region in germany and it is one of the biggest industries here . 
  but who the hell cares about vorpommern in the european parliament ? 
  it is n't even important in the german politics ... 
  it was even singned by a guy namend jean-claude juncker and still they broke the no-bail-out rule severall times . 
  i was against that , believe me , but the troika decided to brake it and give the debts over to the tax payers instead of banks and investors . 
  now we have to deal with that . 
  we germans have 5 trillion euro in the bank - i think we will survive that . 
  saving the banks in 2008 cost us 184 billion euro and we survived it as well . 
  i constantly want to hit the troika and sch\u00e4uble with a copy of the preamble to the maastricht treaty in the face . 
  there you can read that the original goals of the eu were solidarity , respect , democracy and unity . 
  what those gravediggers of the european idea are doing right now is the exact opposite . 
  no , not at all . 
  at least here in germany 1.080 $ ca n't be touched by anyone but you . 
  twice the minimum wage of greek workers ... 
   and will be gone after the next elections . 
  in berlin they still have 4-5 % in surveys so maybe they stay at least in that parliament . 
  by the way the pirates in berlin are one of the most left-wing groups of the party . 
  that 's not the point of the video . 
  the point is that not just the media is full of anti-greek bullshit , but the minds of the germans are as well . 
  those headlines were pretty nice compared to what you read on facebook and twitter all day long .
