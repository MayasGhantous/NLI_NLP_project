  of course they have , but they will never publish it , while every fucking podesta e-mail about ordering pizza needs a special announcement . 
  both actually . 
   data are taken from here . 
  then you fucked up at multible points . 
  valle d'aosta is at -0,44 and red . 
  meanwhile latvia is at -0,54 and is orange . 
  or k\u00f6z\u00e9p-magyarorsz\u00e1g is at -0,16 but you colored it blue . 
  literally all three dark blue areas in germany are below 1,00 : darmstadt is at 0,85 while oberbayern is at 0,93 and hamburg at 0,81 . 
  same for the dark blue areas in belgium . 
  they are just unlucky and underrepresented in this map to be honest . 
  they are exactly at -0,03 but get the same color as latvia with -0,54 while mecklenburg-vorpommern with +0,06 is already among the good ones . 
  to quote the king beyond the wall : ' i wish you good fortune in the wars to come . ', 
  the fight for women 's rights will be very hard in turkey in the next years , i hope you can make it . 
  not just `` 1 politician '' . 
  vice chairman gauland supports his comment . 
  you do n't even know how often germans will say stuff like '' ... but he also built the autobahn . '', 
  if you want new land that badly just freaking finish markerwaard already . 
  should be much easier then an island in the middle of the north sea . 
  i never understood the difference of social democracy and democratic socialism . 
  when i listen to the pragmatic wing of die linke and the left wing of spd they say the same things in 95 % of the cases . 
  and the 5 % differences are dogmatic things like that die linke opposes our nato membership or foreign interventions . 
  not my fault that you do n't know your history .

  remember those days when germany was a mediterranean state ? 
  make germany great again !, 
  [ cool source buddy . 
  ] ( http://en.rightpedia.info/w/gregor_gysi ) i feel free to block you now . 
  enough of this non-sense . 
   his choice of words was pretty clear , he 's a stasi collaborator as well . 
  instead of ratting out jews he enjoyed ratting out dissidents , he 's equally as deplorable as any other fervent nazi of the time . 
  funny since his far-right opponents tend to claim that he is a jew . 
  there were several investigations and non found that he was a stasi member . 
  he was a lawyer who defended dissidents and if you had any idea about east germany during that time you would know that it was only possible to get things done in that position by dealing with the regime . 
  that happens when you do n't understand german grammar . 
  he said that it 's fortunate that the nazis do n't get more children , not that it 's fortunate that more germans die then they are born . 
  his choice of words was n't perfect but if you would know him you would know what he talks about . 
  gysi is by far the most loved person in die linke with support across the complete left spectrum . 
  even at last years unternehmertag ( entrepreneur 's day ) he received a warm welcome and lots of applause . 
  in the last election he had higher approval ratings then spd chancellor candidate steinbr\u00fcck . 
  i 'd urge you to watch [ this speech of him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp0fvvpfbfu ) which the university in t\u00fcbingen called the speech of the year . 
   die linke is pants on head retarded that 's bullshit and you know it . 
  while i 'm not a linke-voter myself and i know that they have their fair share of crazy fools they do a totally fine , pragmatic job in several state governments . 
   i think it 's time for him to stand down and let someone else take over . 
  was n't there something about him being the only official member of his party ? 
  while the [ german shepherd ] ( http://www.wolf-dog-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/schaeferhund_profil-e1352906705787.jpg ) is of course the most iconic i 'd like to present you the beautiful , fluffy , gigantic [ leonberger ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ijutjzk.jpg ) .

  literally the largest fascist organisation in germany today are the turkish gray wolves . 
  as [ extra 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2e2yhjc_mc ) said : `` equal rights for women - beaten up equally . '', 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/s6oaqhrotzs?t=5s ), 
  last international women 's day turkish police has beaten up peaceful feminist protests . 
  well yeah but why should we single out only one of the 18 german states ? 
  germany : the news are dominated by one topic : lots of fuzz about turkey , campaign trips of turkish officials , erdogan being erdogan , bomb threat in gaggenau , the imprisonment of deniz y\u00fccel , etc. 
  oh also hamburg played in munich and received their annual bitch slap ( 0:8 ) . 
  who could we blame today that we have n't blamed lately ? 
  * ~ ~ kurds ~ ~ * ~ ~ g\u00fclen ~ ~ * ~ ~ obama ~ ~ * ~ ~ israel ~ ~ * ~ ~ journalists ~ ~ * ~ ~ armenians ~ ~ * ~ ~ shias ~ ~ * ~ ~ gays ~ ~ * ~ ~ feminists ~ ~ * germans germans ? 
  sounds good enough . 
  `` the germans are nazis that hate our democracy ! '', 
   now think how many people die in socialist countries and died in the old warsaw-pact countries . 
  as i said : because of a lack of health care ? 
  no one , at least not in east germany . 
  we had a lack of bananas , democracy and freedom of movement , not of health care . 
  `` hey , just 45.000 dead people per year , who the hell cares ?! '', 
  - the same nation that went to war because of 3.000 victims on 9/11 . 
  oh east germany had socialism and despite all it 's flaws no one had to drink lead or had to die because they could n't afford health care like in certain great capitalistic nations .

  my comment was a little simplistic , definitely . 
  i was more annoyed by this fear mongering that the social security proposed by a center-left party like gl would be disastrous for the netherlands . 
  i think that social and liberal values have to be balanced . 
  let 's take an easy example : from a liberal point of view paying for university only makes sense since why should those who do n't attend it be forced to finance it , right ? 
  problem with that is that many people ca n't afford to pay the cost and ca n't visit a university which leads to them never reaching their full potential where they could give creative impulses that benefit our economy . 
  or to make it even more simple : it would have sucked if an albert einstein would have been born into a super poor family which would have been not even able to feed him without help and he would have starved to death because of a lack of social security . 
  would n't that have been a huge loss for humanity ? 
  what i wan na say is that the whole state can benefit from those social benefits in some cases . 
  because someone has to pay for things or you ca n't run a state at all . 
  so who shall pay for it ? 
  those that have nothing whatsoever ? 
  those who have nothing left if you tax them high ? 
  or maybe those who still have more then they need after taxing them high ? 
  i mean you act like working hard would n't pay of at all . 
  let 's say you are a middle age married judge with two children in germany and you earn 5.000 $ before taxes . 
  you would have 3.300 $ per month . 
  now let 's say you are a cashier in supermarket and you earn 2.200 $ before taxes . 
  you would have 1.700 $ left per month . 
  is n't twice as much as the lower paid people enough for you ? 
  will your life drastically improve if your taxes get cut by astronomical 20 % so mr judge has 340 $ more per month ? 
  no it would n't . 
  but collecting those 20 % from all mr judges in the country actually drastically improves the lives of the sick , old , children from poor families or simply those who were n't blessed with your intelligence or endurance . 
  not everyone has the potential to be a mister judge . 
  some are mr cashier or mrs cleaner or mr cab driver or mrs farmer . 
  and believe it or not : they work hard as well every day and they deserve a live in dignity as well . 
   never to be seen again . 
  i love it when people act like the state just eats the money . 
  you ever saw that asshole ? 
  look in the mirror . 
  we are the state . 
  and what are you today thanks to all that socialism ? 
  one of the richest countries on the planet . 
  so cry me a river .
