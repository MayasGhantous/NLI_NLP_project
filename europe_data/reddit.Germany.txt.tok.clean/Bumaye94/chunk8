  i hate it when benelux , nordics and gro\u00dfdeutschl\u00e4nder act like the apocalypse would be near while 95 % of the world population is jealous of our standard of living . 
   the three biggest polling parties vvd , pvv and cda can form government together . 
  no they ca n't . 
  you need 76 seats for a majority . 
  even in yesterdays very positive ipsos poll for all three they just had 71 seats . 
  i&o research has them at 62 seats , de stemming at 63 seats , peil at 72 seats and tns nipo at 72 seats as well . 
  no poll sees a vvd/pvv/cda majority . 
  all i want is a strong gl and d66 and no pvv in the government . 
  i think that could come true . 
  i trust the judgement of our swamp bros. 
  have read quite a bit about unusually high turnout in nationalist areas . 
  while i 'm not a fan of sinn fein the message sent would be fun to watch . 
  i 'd probably vote for sdlp or greens , maybe alliance . 
  brandenburg is ridiculously high . 
  i mean of course the areas surrounding berlin are fine but most of the state is pretty fucked . 
  also i honestly do n't think that mecklenburg is worse then sachsen-anhalt . 
  we could have been ghana or tunisia but at the end of the day mecklenburgers still ends up on the baltic sea . 
  we might not be scandinavian super humans or incredible swamp germans but our english is not that bad . 
  trump was 5-10 points behind hillary for the whole race , not 20 points . 
  and by the french election system hillary would have won . 
  just because the muricans held your hands . 
  [ may we should remind him . 
  ] ( https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/2._slesvigske_krig ) come and try . 
  time to make alsen and nordschleswig german . 
  we can import goods to improve our infrastructure from eu partners . 
  deal ? 
  [ currently just 7 % of the germans say that their own economical situation is bad . 
  ] ( https://www.zdf.de/assets/170217-bilder-102~768x432?cb=1487320074532 ) i 'd say it reaches us . 
  good , now let 's spent some of that . 
  if we do n't improve our infrastructure soon then those numbers wo n't last long . 
  also time to bail out some broken cities and towns . 
  the city of oberhausen for example has higher debt then the whole state of saxony . 
  kaiserslautern , duisburg , essen and some others do n't look much differently . 
  those cities wo n't make it much longer without larger federal support . 
  come eu and we will gib . 
  redditor since four days yet you act like you have figured out everyone on this sub . 
   there are a few decent players on lol i 'd say the only one right now is alphari . 
  snoopeh , fredy122 and kasing at least were good at some point . 
  compared to the danish or swedish that is pretty pathetic to be honest . 
  oh , is that so ? 
  how come that most of your areas belonged to the [ frankish empire already in 481 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/frankish_empire_481_to_814-de.svg/1280px-frankish_empire_481_to_814-de.svg.png ) already ? 
  and when the [ carolingian empire was split in the treaty of mersen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/carolingian_empire_870.svg/1024px-carolingian_empire_870.svg.png ) you were on the german side , is n't that weird ? 
  and that you were part of [ regnum teutonicum ( the kingdom of germany ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/hrr_10jh.jpg ) is weird as well in that regard . 
  or the [ holy roman empire of german nations ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/hrr_1400.png ) . 
  the close connections between dutch and lower german are confusing too . 
  face it , if some minor things would have went differently in history then we would have german states called holland and brabant today . 
  germany is a really young country . 
  for example portugal basically exists since 1251 ( end of the reconquista in portugal ) - germany exists since 1848 . 
  tons of different states with different influences and different people . 
  bavarians and hamburgers are not closer aligned then swedes and danes historically . 
  in fact lower german ( plattdeutsch ) is linguistically it 's own language somewhere between german and dutch . 
  then you have all the german tribes ( franks , alemanni , saxonians , etc. ), 
  which plays a role as well . 
  north-west germany is following protestantism , southern germany is catholic and north-east germany is atheistic . 
  the only thing that really unites germans as germans is that we speak some form of german but then again so do austrians , people from south tyrol , most of the swiss , luxemburgers and even though they 'd never admit it even the dutch and flanders . 
  so yeah german is a really unusual state and a weird people . 
  order a pfannkuchen in mecklenburg and you will get a pancake . 
  oder a berliner and you will get a berliner . 
  we are simple people . 
  most people here that i know just put the words together and call it eierpfannkuchen . 
  the last election was before the afd was founded . 
  the latest poll ( one moth old ) has them at 8 % in lower saxony . 
  good , another 500 people ( un - ) covered . 
  when do we ban trenchcoats , hats , sunglasses and large scarves ? 
  if you really wan na cover yourself to commit a crime then you will certainly find a way . 
  i have no problem with it but it 's no issue , really . 
  i would be surprised if the number of permanent residents wearing a burka in german would be above 500 women . 
  and at the end a niqab plus sunglasses does the same . 
  yeah because a lot of rich arabs enjoy the great german doctors and come here for surgeries . 
   sigmar `` das pack '' gabriel i love it when people do n't understand context or just ignore it to push their agenda . 
  gabriel did n't called afd voters or right-wing conservatives or even pegida members that way but nazis who went violent after the police stopped them from attacking a refugee hostel in heidenau . 
  yes , the far-right wing around the state leaders from thuringia ( h\u00f6cke ) , lower saxony ( hampel ) and saxony-anhalt ( poggenburg ) are in more or less an open rebellion against the national-conservative wing around petry . 
  berlin is over all shitty from a political point of view and berliners try to blame who ever currently governs them for that . 
  r2g is doing a totally fine job in thuringia and same for red-red in brandenburg . 
   what 's wrong with sachsen ? 
  that 's something the rest of germany is asking for a while . 
  those are frikandeln !, 
  we are talking about this : http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/rezepte/21/21488/134311-960x720-berliner-bouletten.jpg, 
  that far west part is luxemburg . 
  the reason is simple : the word is originally french and luxemburgers use a whole lot of french loanwords . 
  the north-east is mainly berlin and brandenburg , that is because a lot of the huguenot refugees settled around berlin and brought the word with them . 
  frikadeller is simply the danish word , not the english . 
  yeah but what would be the english word for frikadelle or bulette ? 
  [ that looks pretty boulette-esque to me . 
  this and a lot of other such maps can be found here : http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/alltagssprache-bulette-oder-frikadelle-bolzen-oder-kicken-a-1109490.html major regions with other names : * switzerland : hackt\u00e4tschli * south-east austria : faschiertes laibchen * southern saxony : beefsteak * south tyrol : fleischkrapferl, 
  triggered . 
  when you sit in the ep next to the polish pis then you are anything but center-left . 
  for fucks sake they are in the same european party ( acre ) as erdogans akp . 
  then again i like the choice of words `` nationalistic central-leftist '' - is that political correctness for national socialists ? 
  even if melenchon would endorse him i doubt that a majority of his voters would follow him and back the ps candidate . 
  yeah but probably the only that runs for a racist far-right party . 
  it 's the same amount of babies , murican babies are just fat . 
  [ yes , sir . 
  i forgot milano . 
  but yeah . 
  it 's mainly because we are pretty strict about our cities . 
  while the chinese for example simply enlarge their cities further and further around the original territory we do that much less . 
  take frankfurt as an example . 
  frankfurt right now has around 730.000 inhabitants - every year 15.000 more settle in germany 's fifth biggest city . 
  nevertheless it is expected that frankfurt wo n't grow much above 800.000 inhabitants .
