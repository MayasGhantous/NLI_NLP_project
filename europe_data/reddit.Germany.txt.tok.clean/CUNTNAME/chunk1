but it is conducted for the zdf . 
  so calling it zdf polls is totally ok . 
  the `` forschungsgruppe wahlen '' did those polls for the zdf . 
  i would n't trust those zdf polls , they also predicted that miliband would win against david cameron . 
  they predicted that the creek referendum would be a close yes . 
  if their predictions do n't match they call it surprising . 
  [ no they are not . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb82/eb82_de_de_nat.pdf ) 61 % of german citizens are against migration from outside the eu . 
  it is not only the one mayor though , they are doing this in several places across germany . 
  and no politician seems to care that the number of refugees is higher than the number of police man . 
  [ translated article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.focus.de%2fpolitik%2fausland%2ffluechtlingskrise-im-news-ticker-fluechtlinge-werfen-steine-auf-wachleute-vor-lageso_id_4965433.html ) refugees had thrown stones at the guards of the security company , eyewitnesses report . 
  the lageso staff had retreated into the building . 
  ( lageso is berlin 's state office of health and welfare ) . 
  `` may the germans never forget what made the fight for liberation necessary and whereby they won . '', 
  about the liberation of germany from napoleon . 
  i do n't really use the term , but the media that only shows kids and woman when they talk about refugees , always highlight positive examples but almost never negative events , even though there are planty of them , feels very manipulative . 
  the refugees in front if the rail station in hungary were shouting `` germany '' , `` angela merkel '' and `` allu akbar '' but the `` allu akbar '' was cut out in the news . 
  why ? 
  they never showed the stone throwing and shouting groups of migrants and the list grows every day . 
  if you want to see the full side of the story you have to resort to other media , social networks , youtube , reddit etc. 
  this sucks massively . 
  and how do you call it ? 
  healthy censoring ? 
  no they wo n't just sit there and freeze to death . 
  they will try to get to a warm place no matter what . 
  if it was my decision you could come , spanish people seem nice . 
  in his comment history i saw that he has a python script running that checks new submissions for keywords like `` immigration '' or `` islam '' , so he is filtering . 
  if you have a new account and post about this topic you get banned with the explanation that it looks like an account of someone trying to circumvent a ban , `` multi account '' . 
  furthrtmore he is associated with the pirate party ( where he is mod as well ) , which i would n't care about if he would stay objective but he is censoring based on an political agenda . 
  yes , there are many ifs , but it still scares me . 
  what happens when the government fails to provide a warm shelter for all refugees by the end of october / beginning of november . 
  how will the refugees react when it gets cold ? 
  how the government ? 
  will they just take every empty place they can find ? 
   do you even know how many refugees we can take in and what the consequences would be ? 
  well do you ? 
   you follow up your `` mass immigration '' phrase with `` we need to take care of our citizens first '' , sprinkled with `` i 'm not against legitimate refugees '' . 
  so you just put things in my mouth i never said ? 
  you are clearly just upset and not able anymore to focus on the arguments , you resort to putting people into categories . 
  it 's quite offensive to divide the groups by `` offering help '' and `` throwing rocks '' . 
  there are a lot of people who are against mass immigration . 
  but this does n't mean i would treat refugees badly , if they are here they should be treated like every human , but we can decide if we take millions of them before they make their way to germany . 
  ( the migration wo n't stop in 2016 , so over several years it will be millions ), 
   housing temporary to accomplish this politicians are planning to ** confiscate empty houses ** . 
  they first make you an offer and if you deny they are allowed to confiscate the house . 
  a disturbing thought , 400.000 refugees is bigger than the size of the police or the army . 
  also , those are the ones that are ** already registered ** . 
  there are so many that offices in berlin are closed to process the applications and they do n't register new people until the end of the year . 
  furthermore a lot do n't register in the first place because they fear to get deported . 
  they go to work in the black labor marked . 
  you are joking , but in germany some assholes are distributing poisoned dog treats , or food with pieces of razor blades in them in parks where people walk their dogs . 
  guess which people do n't like dogs ... http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article137706851/hundehasser-legen-ueber-5000-vergiftete-koeder-aus.html, 
  we need a new party . 
  the laws always need to be considered as a whole ( so including all the other laws ) and the application of a law in germany always depends on the case and scenario . 
  one might think so , but erdogan is about to change the turkish constitution to turn turkey into a `` president-governed '' country . 
  in the way he does this it 's a step away from democracy . 
  merkel just stated that it 's impossible to secure the german border , then how on earth should we control the eu borders ( according to her ) . 
  according to me we could do both . 
  we should keep track of that village . 
  how many germans will stay there ? 
  will it turn into a ghetto ? 
  call me a moron , but i think there will be war . 
  additionally she said : ** `` it is not in our power how many come to germany '' ** and combined with the statement that we ca n't control the borders she just threw away our sovereignty . 
  itt : people eating popcorn,

  it starts to boil in germany , i expect big events in the next few days . 
  the good run away , the stupid slaughter those who stay and then get bombed for it . 
  much dead . 
  when there was no shengen yet , you could easily travel through europe . 
  you just had to show your passport at the border and a police man looked into your face . 
  well she said * '' [ ... ] then it 's not my country anymore '' *, 
  [ eu should ` undermine national homogeneity ' says un migration chief ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395 ), 
  yes he is . 
  go out and talk to your neighbors and people in the park . 
  only the wired ones like what is going on . 
  first estimate was 400.000 , then they just doubled it to 800.000 . 
  now they nearly doubled it again to 1.5 million . 
  either they are really bad at it or doing the salami tactic . 
  my guess , next estimate will be close to 3 million . 
  yes but there is a translator in between . 
  so you have to rely on an arabic translator . 
  if he has a `` good day '' he might let them slip through . 
  something that should be noted , such polls are usually conducted over telephone . 
  someone who knows your name asks you on the telephone what you would vote . 
  it 's probably still a valuable result though . 
  but i imagine that people do n't like to say on the phone that they vote afd for example . 
  that might get skewed . 
  in the comment sections of german news websites people write a lot of political incorrect stuff , but after all they say what they think . 
  the mood in the comments was bad for months . 
  in the last two weeks the mood in the official media changed as well to the negative . 
  now in the comment sections the mood starts to get a bit aggressive , some talk about war , some about the government which needs to step back etc. 
  but in all the political incorrectness the predictions in the comments were better than in the articles . 
  everybody expected the number to grow over 1 million and more . 
  everybody expected the riots and that there wo n't be enough space . 
  and now we are here and it still does n't stop . 
  she is stupid . 
  closing europe towards the middle east can only work together with russia if you check out the map and look which ethics live in which territories . 
  they know we need them . 
  all the actions from russia are also quite interesting , open the second biggest mosque in moscow , quickly after that withdraw the big guns from ukraine and start bombing syria . 
  the `` probing '' flights with the bombers against europe look more like a signal as well .
