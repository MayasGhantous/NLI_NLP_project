  i think the biggest reason was language . 
  of course this depends a lot on both country and university , but for the most time you 're going to be disadvantaged if you do n't speak the native language of your host university . 
  for the uk and ireland , this is not really a problem , because practically everyone speaks english . 
  for my university , there were people fighting over spots in mediocre uk universities , whereas i and my german-speaking friends got our spots in some of the best german unis unopposed . 
  tl ; dr : spots are allocated symmetrically in the exchange program , but not all of them get used . 
  uk universities are more attractive than the universities they 're partnered up with and receive more students than they send . 
  religion and doctrine ? 
  ironically blocked by gema in germany : / ( yes , i know about youpak ), 
  vote no , or the baby gets it . 
  the danish system is much more flexible when it comes to things like hours and job security . 
  it 's often used as an example in swedish debates on how to reform the system . 
  i ca n't speak for finland , but part of the problem in sweden is strict labour laws , high taxes and high de facto minimum wages . 
  it 's just really unattractive to hire young people in sweden . 
  both are pretty common knowledge and i took these excerpts straight from wikipedia . 
  you can find the primary source from there if you 're interested . 
  cornflakes :  john harvey kellogg is best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal , corn flakes , in 1878 . 
  originally , he called this cereal granula , which he later changed to granola in 1881 . 
  however , due to patent rights , he had to once again change the name to corn flakes . 
  [ 16 ] these corn flakes were invented as part of his health regimen to prevent masturbation . 
  his belief was that bland foods , such as these , would decrease or prevent excitement and arousal . 
  [ 17 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_harvey_kellogg#breakfast_cereals circumcision :  circumcision in english-speaking countries arose in a climate of negative attitudes towards sex , especially concerning masturbation . 
  in her 1978 article the ritual of circumcision , [ 57 ] karen erickson paige writes : `` the current medical rationale for circumcision developed after the operation was in wide practice . 
  the original reason for the surgical removal of the foreskin , or prepuce , was to control ` masturbatory insanity ' -- the range of mental disorders that people believed were caused by the ` polluting ' practice of ` self-abuse . ' '', 
  it caught on in the us as a way to prevent masturbation . 
  this about the same reasoning as dr. kellogg 's anti-mastubatory breakfast cereal , known to us as cornflakes . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  the article you linked only mentions that it was dissolved because of the outbreak of ww1 . 
  most countries abandoned the gold standard and printed money to finance the war effort . 
  a lot or people are talking about the position if english as the most widely spoken language in europe . 
  however , if you remove the 65 or so million native speakers that stand to leave with the uk , the difference between english and german shrinks down significantly . 
  more importantly , there will be very few native speakers left , and it will not be the official eu language of any country . 
  i 'm not saying that english will lose its importance in eu overnight , but i can definitely see a move towards more german and french . 
  it was n't that long ago that german and french were the primary foreign languages learned in my home country of sweden . 
  english did n't become the main foreign language until after world war 2 , in true swedish opportunist fashion . 
  they 're also british , we should be glad they 've heard of spain . 
  buckle up , buckaroos . 
  i was going to attack the local shop selling british food delicacies , but they have it hard enough as it is . 
  salmon is food of capitalist pig . 
  try beet , is salmon of field . 
  close enough for most applications . 
  kilo is just a prefix . 
  i think you mean kilogram . 
  gustavus adolphus ( sweden ) as a leader choice i suppose he 's pretty good . 
  he was a well known figure , a great military tactician and marked the start of the short-lived period of sweden as a great power in europe . 
  his depiction in the game is really bad . 
  he looks more like the portraits of erik xiv than himself . 
  compare his leader screen : http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/civilization/images/e/ee/gustavus_adolphus_ ( civ5 ) . jpg/revision/latest ? cb = 20150920142014 with a portrait of erik xiv https://annabelfrage.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/220px-erik_xiv_1533-1577_domenicus_verwildt.jpg and gustavus adolphus : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/attributed_to_jacob_hoefnagel_-_gustavus_adolphus,_king_of_sweden_1611-1632_-_google_art_project.jpg he speaks contemporary swedish , but like most nobles and city-dwellers in sweden at the time , he would have spoken medieval low german . 
  he does n't even speak like a king , he sounds like a failed tv presenter . 
  then there 's the fact that they 've misspelled a whole bunch of city names ( i 've probably missed some ) : * v\u00e4ster\u00e5s - spelled v\u00e4ster\u00e4s * jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 - spelled jyvaskyla * \u00d6rebro - spelled orebro * ume\u00e5 - spelled umea all in all , it had great potential but they really dropped the ball on the details . 
  the uus are nice thematically and the ua is okay , but really boring and does n't work well with the theme . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're saying . 
  would a problematic danish exit cause finland and sweden to leave as well ? 
  or would it cause denmark to leave the nordic council ? 
  either way , i think you 're forgetting about centuries of strife between sweden and denmark . 
  i think plenty of swedes would be happy to make a sharp left on peberholm and connect the bridge with a tunnel directly to fehmarn instead . 
  for you . 
  wow , you seem upset . 
  have some mcdonald 's before you go shoot up a school . 
  i 've been in this sub plenty and more importantly : i 'm european by birth and by residence . 
  this subreddit is about europe , so why is it that this sub is flooded with americans with little or no interest or insight in european matters ? 
  either stick to what this subreddit is about , or get out . 
  yanks always find a way the make it about themselves . 
  i 'm just pointing out the fact that they dubbed david cameron . 
  in other countries , you 'd use subtitles for that . 
  that would allow those who understand him get his original , unaltered message , while the ignorant would still be able to understand it . 
  but then there is an interview with david cameron where you can hear him starting to speak before being overdubbed by a german woman . 
  schr\u00f6der is the president of fifa ? 
  a newt ? 
  ah , the old denholm reynholm move . 
  that 's the thing with england , they 're always trying to walk it in . 
  did you see that ludicrous display last night ? 
  uk vows cooperation with the eu ? 
  i suppose there is a first time for everything . 
  it 's not so much the numbers , it 's about locking the currency to the erm ii , setting a target exchange rate and a maximum deviation of 2.25 % . 
  right now , the swedish inflation numbers are a bit too high , but in the period between 1994 and now there have been several years where sweden has had all the criteria fulfilled , with the exception of erm ii . 
  how is this strange ? 
  sweden has done this several times . 
  most recently was g\u00f6ran persson , who took over in 1996 , right between the 1994 and 1998 elections . 
  we also had changes between different parties , like when f\u00e4lldin i ( c ) was disbanded and ullsten ( fp ) was formed . 
  many countries , like the uk and sweden , do n't elect their leaders directly , so i do n't see why a new election is necessary . 
  even countries where the head of government is elected directly have had this happen . 
  just look at gerald ford who ascended to the position of vice president and then president of the us , without even taking part in any presidential elections in the first place . 
  i heard most of them are n't even english !, 
  lots of democracies have indirect elections of their head of state and or head of government . 
  also , even in election systems that do have direct elections , most of them allow a candidate to win without having a majority . 
  careful though , they are battle-hardened against balrogs and the armies of mordor . 
  which is stupidly easy to not fulfil , since one of the requirements is to join erm ii for 2 years . 
  there is nothing that forces a country to join this , something sweden has been using for years : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_and_the_euro, 
  actually , this is not true at all . 
  plenty of smaller countries run intra-eu trade surpluses ( the dutch surplus is about 4 times that of germany ) , and several larger countries run intra-eu trade deficits ( france and the uk top that list ) . 
  there has been a lot of investment in eastern europe ( both from the eu as well as private investors ) , and the idea that smaller countries have `` much smaller industrial output '' is ridiculous . 
  sure , poorer countries export less , but they also import less , and smaller countries trade less as a country , but not necessary per capita . 
  you 're just trying to fit your na\u00efve ideas of how the eu trade works to some kind of conspiracy , but sadly it has not worked out . 
  here 's a chart of intra-eu trade balances if you 're interested : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:intra-eu_trade_balance_by_member_state,_2013_ ( eur_1_000_million ) . png, 
  alea iacta est ( `` the die is cast '' ) is a latin phrase attributed by suetonius ( as iacta alea est [ \u02c8jakta \u02c8a\u02d0lea est ] ) to julius caesar on january 10 , 49 bc as he led his army across the rubicon river in northern italy .

  i do n't know how many turks you might have in the uk , but here in germany there are plenty of them and they 're not exactly favoured over other muslim immigrants . 
  and what big blockbuster has its us premiere tomorrow ? 
  that 's right , independence day 2 : independent boogaloo . 
  i think not .
