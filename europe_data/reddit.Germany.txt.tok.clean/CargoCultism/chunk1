do the [ donaulied ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq9pgsbmilg ) or [ bolle reiste j\u00fcngst zu pfingsten ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hln25ck2vdk ) and the rest of the mundorgel count as folk ? 
  those are pretty well known . 
  not to say that german folk songs are high quality by any measure , but surely they exist ? 
  apparently , a [ terminal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaip%c4%97da_lng_fsru ) for regasification of liquefied natural gas opened this year in klaip\u0117da , so lithuania does have the infrastructure to receive lng via ships . 
  do n't give him any ideas , knowing him he would probably be able to pull it off ... 
  well , the uk is quite attractive to people who already speak english . 
   last week it was : germany in favor of refugees . 
  today worried . 
  from the article :  the annual `` angst '' poll of 2,373 people was conducted between june 5 and july 17, 
  i see , thanks to both of you pointing that out . 
  first off , thanks for taking the time to type this up . 
   this confirms the image of `` europhiles '' as patriarchs who think the people are too stupid to know what 's good for them . 
  yeah , that is a common complaint over here as well . 
   the argument goes that to secure future positions in the eu government , politicians will serve the eu before serving their own countries . 
  that is interesting , in germany the eu bureaucracy is more seen as a good place to park disgraced politicians or people who would n't have made it in the german political landscape . 
  it is a good question if dijsselbloem would have been elected as head of the euro-group if he would have made more of a fuss about the extra payment . 
  that being said , does anyone know if the uk succeded in not paying the extra money ? 
  i ca n't find sources on this . 
   as for the elections , 2012 was a year of `` strategic voting '' i just took a look at the current polls for the 2017 election , and apparently the pvv is leading the polls , so you might be right about voters going back to the pvv and sp . 
   it 's hard to be really eurosceptic if your country is all but running the eu i do n't think the common german thinks he/she profits from merkel being the leader . 
  euroscepticism comes as easy to us as to anyone else , as signified by the whole pegida thing and the rise ( and recent fall due to pretty unrelated reasons ) of the afd . 
  why not really ? 
  what you proposed is yet another answer and does not invalidate anything i wrote . 
  i have no idea what any of the means , are the odds currently in favor of leaving the eu or no ? 
  i deliberately left that part out because i do not think that integrating germans into the german society was a task comparable to integrating refugees/temporary workers into the society . 
  that depends on whether the question is how to solve the refugee crisis or how the uk can avoid to take in any refugees . 
  for the latter , leaving the eu would be an answer , right ? 
  do you feel as a part of europe ? 
  i guess most europeans think that europe ends at the bosporus and the caucasian states are firmly entrenched in the russian sphere of influence . 
   '' ( ... ) the most important thing is to try to bring peace and stability to that part of the world . '', 
  agreed , of course , that would be a great long term goal . 
  the only problem is that no-one nows how we can achieve that , so if you have a plan , out with it mr. cameron . 
  until then , what exactly do you propose what we should do with the refugees ? 
   when we , as a people , voice our dissatisfaction with the eu how do you ( as a people ) voice your dissatisfaction with the eu ? 
  honest question , i do not know much about dutch internal politics/protests . 
  did ' t the main eurosceptic parties ( pvv ) approval even go down in the 2012 elections ? 
  are the more popular know as they were in 2012 ? 
  as a german , i did not have the knowledge that the dutch are more dissatisfied with the eu as everyone else . 
  so in your opinion the sentence downplays the fact that the houses have been deliberately torched as an act of terrorism ? 
  for the record , `` going up in flames '' is a direct translation of `` in flammen aufgehen '' , which imo does include a vaguely terroristic background , so you can chalk that up to ineptitude , i did not mean to downplay that shameful behavior . 
  for the record , that was in fact not an attempt at humor , rather ineptitude . 
  an attempt at humor usually starts with `` achtung , witz ! '', 
  or something like that . 
  well , that is kinda funny , i admit :d  and your english looks perfect to me !, 
  thanks , and thanks for the feedback , from time to time i write a sentence that does not really express what i meant to say , so it is valuable to me . 
  wow , that is really surprising to me as well , thanks for sharing this !, 
  do n't mistake me , i am very happy that you have this impression , but i do n't think thats something that is connected with germans often . 
  germans ?!, 
  are known to be cheerful ?!, 
  what ? 
  where ? 
  to be fair , the original question did not specify it had to be `` african '' immigration . 
  but my second example , gastarbeiter , does include people from morocco and turkey , which are comparable countries to syria i think . 
  according to the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruhrpolen ) the majority spoke masurian , kaschubian und silesian . 
  i see your point , i understand the frustration with the eu ( who does n't ? 
  ) , but if we ( europe ) want our opinions to be heard on an international scale and * matter * , we have to be somewhat united and splitting the eu up and the constant infighting achieves the exact opposite . 
  part of the problem is that merkel could take up a `` leader '' role pretty much unopposed , and she really is n't a good leader for the eu . 
  why ? 
  have i made it sound like it 's a competition ? 
  i am not a native english speaker , obviously :d, 
  well , to be able to work for your interests , you have to have some kind of clout . 
  cameron has already been criticized for [ `` foreign policy irrelevance '' ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647618-meet-little-britain-shrinking-actor-global-stage-punch-and-duty ) but outside of the eu and unattached to the us , there is not much reason why anyone would care about your interests , right ? 
  i think we might have been misunderstanding each other . 
  well , if there is one thing that you can trust in german politics , it is that merkel only does thing things that a solid majority of the population agree with . 
  so if she says stuff like [ this ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-31/merkel-says-germans-must-fight-xenophobia-as-europe-faces-crisis ) , apparently the majority is okay with that , as my personal observations would support . 
  on the other hand refugee housing has been going up in flames in record numbers , so there is at least some disagreement . 
  we did not have to wait 70 years for that , 15 would have [ sufficed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastarbeiter ) . 
  syrian asylum seekers can gain german citizenship after they stayed in the country for six years , i think . 
  so unless the war wraps up quickish , they do have a way to a legitimate citizenship . 
  `` nahles added that this increase and other expenditure , such as offering language classes to refugees , would lead to extra costs in her ministry 's budget of between 1.8 billion and 3.3 billion euros in 2016 . '', 
  i really really do n't see the connection to bulgarian wages , do you ? 
  turning the soli into a `` help refugees '' fund would be a pretty good idea imo !, 
  the headline is n't misleading unless you try pretty hard to misunderstand it . 
  yeah , making europe look weak and quarreling was our nefarious plan all along !, 
  two examples would be the `` ruhrpolen '' and the `` gastarbeiter '' , respectively . 
  `` ruhrpolen '' ( polish people in the ruhr area ) describes a migration wave in the late 19th century of workers from eastern poland who found work in the ruhr area due to the massive industrialization going on . 
  by now you can pretty much only tell by the last names of people who belonged to that migration wave and some left-over slurs from the time ( `` polacken '' ) i.e. 
  in hindsight the ruhrpolen integrated pretty well . 
  after the war , a lot of the `` german , working age , male '' demography was gone for obvious reasons , which hobbled the industry ( full employment ) . 
  thus we started to officialy ask for gastarbeiter , `` guest workers '' in the sixties from spain , greece , turkey etc. 
  to alleviate that problem . 
  the original idea was to send the workers back after a while , but for some unfathomable reason a portion of the foreign workers decided to stay here . 
  i 'd say that it is still a matter of debate what the popular opinion on the success of integration of the gastarbeiter is . 
  and so humble !, 
  shit i replied to the wrong comment !, 
  just to clarify , do you refer to the court , the customers or the company ? 
  [ the european central bank built and moved into a new hq in frankfurt and apparently some folks are somewhat unhappy with this . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/18/anti-capitalist-protesters-clash-police-ecb-frankfurt-hq ), 
   he also made serious mistakes sometimes . 
   for example he thought that the polka '' \u0160koda l\u00e1sky '' ( beer barrel polka / rosamunde / rosamunda / frida oum papa ... ) is a german folk song . 
  if that 's his worst mistake i think he can rest easily, 
  yeah , but its not like a german journalist would ask the foreign secretary questions in german , is it ? 
  stunning as in you feel stunned and slightly nauseated after seeing it !, 
  telling from the bilingual labels this might be in canada ? 
  what are they like ? 
  looks kinda like [ puffel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berliner_%28doughnut%29 ) . 
  no impact , have n't seen or heard anything personally about immigrants . 
  my aunt started to give german lessons to refugees though , so the crisis might be real afterall ... 
  for such an obvious trolling attempt to get five answers is impressive . 
  good work !,
