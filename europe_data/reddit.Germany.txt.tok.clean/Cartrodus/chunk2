  you are arguing about some other aspect of it altogether . 
  that 's what i meant by arguing semantics . 
  we 're arguing semantics here . 
  of course what i propose takes power from the national governments and gives it to the people , but that 's what democracy is . 
  there would be no further transfer of functions or authority to the european level that has n't already happened , though . 
  the institution is already european in nature . 
  national sovereignty for me means `` we can do what we want and nobody else can impose something on us '' , but the council of the eu ( in conjunction with the european parliament ) ** can already ** impose legislation on member states , even if they do n't agree with it . 
  the transfer of sovereignty has already happened . 
  it does n't matter for national sovereignty whether the decision imposed on you came from elected officials or appointed members of national governments . 
  it matters for transparency , accountability and democracy , though . 
  there 's no transfer from national to european level though , just a transfer from appointed by the government to elected by the people . 
  you will still have representatives that act in the interest of their respective member states . 
  i agree completely with what [ sw66sw already said on the matter ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1943r1/one_of_the_reasons_norway_does_not_want_to_join/c8kt766?context=3 ) . 
  i 'm calling for the council to be removed , so i do n't really get your question . 
  if you want to know what its function currently is , look [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union#powers_and_functions ) . 
  basically , it acts as an upper chamber in the legislative process . 
   the council of ministers should be an elected upper body , somewhere in between proportional representation and equal representation , perhaps similar to the bundesrat . 
  the bundesrat is not really elected though . 
  it 's actually quite similar to what the council of the eu currently is . 
  it basically consists of representatives of the governments of the bundesl\u00e4nder . 
  the us senate is a better example to express what you want , i think . 
  do n't you think you 're putting the cart before the horse here ? 
  we do n't even have referendums on a national scale in germany yet !, 
  you do n't need to transfer sovereignty in order to make your institutions democratic . 
  i have to second igelkotten in not seeing the contradiction here . 
  the only institution on a european level that has any direct democratic legitimization is the european parliament . 
  that 's a bit lacking . 
  make the commission electable . 
  remove the council of the european union and replace it with something akin to the us senate , directly electable . 
  voila , more democracy , absolutely no additional national sovereignty ceded . 
  i always hear that these courses are overrun and severely underfunded . 
  [ spiegel article from 2010 on that very issue ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/wartelisten-integrationskurse-fuer-migranten-sind-ueberlaufen-a-724960.html ) . 
  doubt much has changed about that since then . 
  edit : haha , look what else googling for the topic brought up : http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/campus/1930203/, 
  that 's a bit of an overstatement , since the recent federal reforms the ministry of education of the federal government has absolutely no say over our education system , that competence now almost exclusively lies with the individual states . 
  which pretty much makes this ministry completely useless . 
  but the day politicians remove a lucrative political position will be the day hell freezes over . 
   no state infrastructure childcare for mothers to put their under five years old kids in while they work , thus forcing a good part of them to be stay at home moms , added to a society which culturaly expect women to do so ( see the three k [ 1 ] ) ; and you have a country which leave most women to choose between having kids or a career . 
  i do n't know about that argument . 
  is the natality rate in eastern germany much higher than in western germany ? 
  ( honest question , i do n't know and do n't really feel like researching it right now ) we still have a lot of our old childcare structure in the east , and the stay at home mom culture is n't very common here , but i highly doubt there 's a significant difference in natality rates nowadays . 
   you think you could fund the construction of a new airport on kickstarter , for example ? 
   [ you think you can fund the construction of a new airport through taxes ? 
  :( ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2013/01/07/berlin-airport-delays/1813481/ ), 
  good beer ? 
  lies !, 
  if you look at western europe ( i guess coffee was n't all that popular in the former eastern bloc ? 
  ) , less sunlight seems to somewhat correlate with more coffee . 
  apart from the uk , who strangely are tea drinkers instead for some unfathomable reason !, 
   i wonder why switzerland stands out , though . 
  maybe the mountains block the sun !, 
  til there 's a small buddhist region near the caucasus . 
  honestly did n't know about that . 
  [ off to wikipedia i go !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmykia ), 
  i was so hoping to see atlantis on that map . 
  is n't estonia much closer to finland culturally than to , say , germany or croatia ? 
  pretty broad conditions you have there . 
  german would arguably fit 2 ) and 3 ) too . 
  so would most ( all ? ), 
  languages in western europe . 
  deport them to where , exactly ? 
  if we start deporting ethnicities that entered the european continent 1500 years ago , we 'll have a shit ton of work to do . 
  and i 'm pretty certain they are eu citizens , which gives them certain inalienable rights . 
  but you 're just trolling anyway , are n't you ? 
  well , while there certainly is some kind of feedback loop , on the other hand , germany is a country with a strong green party , a relatively successful post-communist party that emerged after 1990 and recently a rather successful pirate party that emerged out of nowhere and could possibly enter the national assembly ( which requires at least 5 % of the national electoral vote ) barely 7 years after it was first founded . 
  if you ask me , quite a flexible political system . 
   no party affiliated foundations should be founded by the general public why not ? 
  would you rather have think tanks that are based on donations by the rich , like [ these ] ( http://usconservatives.about.com/od/conservativepolitics101/tp/top-conservative-web-sites.htm ) ? 
  or the one that just recently put jakob augstein on a top list of antisemites ? 
  yeah , that 's what we need more of here , broder-like political research and education . 
  well , yes and no . 
  every party that is represented in the national assembly gets public funds to establish and operate a political foundation that promotes and researches the ideology the party is representing . 
  how much funds each party gets for this depends on how many votes they receive - so , indirectly , yes , we can choose what to support . 
  you obviously ca n't write into your tax declaration that none of your taxes are to be spent on a certain party , though . 
  you do n't necessarily need to have publicly financed political foundations , though . 
  you could publicly finance political parties without spending one single cent on foundations . 
  that said , personally , i like the concept of public political foundations . 
  much better than having privately financed think tanks like in the anglo-saxon world . 
   the rosa luxemburg foundation 's activity in romania was mostly about the social situation of the roma and promoting their rights , social inclusion , etc. 
  without touching any hard politics . 
  the rlf is quite small ( and was founded only in 1990 , so not all that old and established either ) and does n't even nearly have the budget of the two bigger german political foundations . 
  i 'm sure they 'd love to be more involved everywhere in the world , including romania , but there is only so much you can do with a staff of 150 . 
  to put this into perspective , the konrad-adenauer-stiftung has around 560 employees . 
  using toys is not a civil right !, 
  if someone does n't want to buy his children toys full of lead and chemical waste , he is certainly free not to buy toys . 
  using electronics is not a civil right !, 
  if someone does n't want to buy crap that explodes after 2 weeks , he is certainly free not to buy it . 
  using medicine is not a civil right !, 
  if someone does n't want to buy medicine that has severe undisclosed secondary effects , he is certainly free not to buy it . 
  see where your argumentation fails ? 
   criminals are using fb to find out when you 're on vacation oh come on . 
  just do n't post everything with public visibility settings ( and do n't add everyone who sends you a request as a friend , obviously ) and you 'll be fine . 
  every time i see this `` criminals are using $ webservice to spy on you '' argument i feel the urge to facepalm . 
  most of the users here actually see immigration in a mostly positive light , at least according to the recent [ survey ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewanalytics?key=0ajtdqi7boekodgjnvnllcuvqrdfnd0rnwhdxa0tszwc&amp;gridid=0#chart ) . 
  i guess the ones who are unhappy are just more vocal about it . 
  i for one do n't feel like putting a comment into every thread about how i am okay with immigration , you know ? 
  the problem is , with social democrats , you have to differentiate between the things they * say * and the things they * do * . 
  steinbr\u00fcck is a particularly striking example of this , unfortunately . 
  i wish the spd had chosen someone else as their candidate .
