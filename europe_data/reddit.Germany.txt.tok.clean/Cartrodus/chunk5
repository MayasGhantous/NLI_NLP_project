  how do you increase bureaucracy by completely eliminating it ? 
  you could completely close every single institution that 's involved in managing social security . 
  no more case workers for childcare benefits , unemployment benefits , housing assistance etc. 
  no more fraud inspectors . 
  no more state pension funds . 
  you could seriously downsize government by introducing a basic income . 
  all you need for distribution are the already existent tax offices . 
  here in germany , of course depending on how high the basic income would be , social security spending would barely be higher than our current social security spending . 
  if i remember correctly current social security spending including administration overhead would be enough to pay every single german citizen ( including children ) a basic income of around 700 euros/month , but i think that includes pensions . 
   it is quite possible that people in your country can actually survive today on welfare , and that is problem in itself , in my opinion . 
  that is the point of a welfare state . 
  if social security is n't enough to survive , you might as well not bother with it at all . 
  social security is there to help people in need , who either are n't able to work at all because of disabilities , are in a tough life situation or just ca n't find a new job instantly . 
  do you let your disabled or sick people starve in lithuania ? 
  you 're talking about social security that you get when you are deemed to need it though . 
  a basic income is a guaranteed income that ** everyone ** gets , no matter whether we are talking about an infant baby , a disabled person , a multi-millionaire , a normal worker or an unemployed person . 
  thus , working ** always ** gives you more income than just receiving the basic income , because you get the basic income in addition to your wage , to answer tuesias ' question . 
  the idea behind it is that it makes providing social security more efficient , as in reducing overhead and bureaucracy significantly , and also rewards occupations that are unpaid today , yet beneficial for society , like caring for your children as a stay-at-home-mom or caring for your grandparents who are in need of heavy care . 
  it 's also an elegant way to deal with the growing unemployment due to automatisation , in my eyes . 
  that way , society does n't have to create new low wage `` mcjobs '' just to reduce mass unemployment . 
  people can get basic income financed by productivity/automatisation gains and do something worthwhile with their life instead of doing boring simple tasks machines could do much more efficiently , to put it simply . 
  it was actually one of the [ first planned steps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_community ) in european integration . 
  it failed due to the french being silly , though . 
  pretty biased article . 
  yes , the pirates do n't have double digits in federal polls anymore . 
  and yes , they have n't exactly been shining with positive media coverage lately . 
  but they still have more than twice the support they had during the last federal elections and in federal states where they actually entered the parliaments , they are still about as popular as they were when elected ( or even more popular , the most current polls in berlin see them at 10 % or more in contrast to the 8,9 % they achieved during the last state level election there ) . 
  what we are seeing is the end of a media hype , not the end of a whole political idea . 
  and to state that pirates are n't able to explain their positions is just slander . 
  there definitely were restrictions on a8 countries . 
  just varied by member state . 
  [ official press release on that ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-11-506_en.htm?locale=en ) . 
   some member states opened up their labour markets straight away to the eu-8 workers from the very start . 
  only germany and austria ( and to a lesser extent the uk with its registration requirement of the uk 's worker registration scheme ) did not apply eu law on free movement to workers from the 8 eu countries until the end of this seven-year period . 
  all fine and dandy , but show me one example in history where pro-cyclical fiscal policy ( specifically , cutting public spending during a recession ) has ever had positive long-term consequences ? 
  how does it help them to pay back the loans they are given when the measures imposed upon them as a precondition for getting these loans affect their economy so negatively that their debt actually increases ? 
  i do n't disagree that greece , portugal etc. 
  wasted a lot of money in the public sector and something has to be changed about that . 
  but i 'm concerned that the current policies pursued by the eu lead to an economic collapse or a decade long economic flat-lining that will negatively affect the whole of europe . 
  austerity to overcome a recession has , to my knowledge , feel free to prove me wrong , never helped a country to come out of an economic crisis . 
  i 'm german , so what the hell are you talking about ? 
   edit : but to address your points . 
  yes , the troika ** is ** asking greece to do cuts in the social sector . 
  for example [ here ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/european-union-demands-further-cuts-in-greece/5307325 ) , [ here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/business/global/rift-with-imf-adds-to-greeces-tensions-in-pivotal-week.html?pagewanted=all ) or [ here ] ( http://www.reporternet.com/gr-categories/economy/4373-troika-demands-cut-in-compensation-for-layoffs ) . 
  quote from the ny times article : `` at the meeting , poul thomsen , the i.m.f. 's lead negotiator for greece , was pushing hard for additional tax increases and wage and pension cuts , these people say . '', 
  we definitely are n't asking them to stop paying for the weapons we sold them . 
  yeah , nobody will argue that stupid investments are n't stupid . 
  i do n't think anybody would mind if austerity meant cutting spending flowing into useless projects like the ones you described . 
  but that 's not what 's happening right now , is it ? 
  the austerity measures are going waaaay beyond cutting unnecessary spending . 
  i do n't think anybody is arguing that something is going wrong in the periphery of the eurozone . 
  the argument is that the austerity measures used right now do nothing to help but actually make the problems worse . 
  it should tip you off that neither the usa nor germany ever use austerity to overcome their crises . 
  merkel would never cut spending in germany to the degree that 's happening in greece or portugal . 
  if the economy tanked , she 'd use a stimulus to encourage growth , expenses be damned , [ as she has done before ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/08/german_recovery_3 ) . 
  merkel is n't drinking her own kool-aid . 
  obama is n't doing it either . 
  neither should you . 
  if the fiscal multiplier is higher than 1 , as is argued for in that article ( and conceded by the imf , go figure ) , your argument makes zero sense . 
  have you actually read the article ? 
  also , he clearly presents data that points to the conclusion that austerity both worsens the situation of public finances ** and ** shrinks the economy . 
  of course correlation is n't causation , but i 've yet to see a case in history where severe austerity measures actually helped the situation . 
  can you present one ? 
  it 's funny that a portuguese argues like that , [ seeing that you are in for the same ride as greece ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21564902-yet-another-austerity-budget-raises-concerns-about-future-growth ) . 
  maybe you should [ read this for a little insight ] ( http://seekingalpha.com/article/935291-the-imf-and-the-fiscal-multiplier ) . 
  and you ca n't balance a budget by crashing an economy . 
  not that hard to get either . 
  your point ? 
  edit : it 's incredible how deeply popular austerity by any means seems to be in this subreddit . 
  i guess it wo n't be seen anyway because downvoting and hiding opinions you do n't agree with is so easy , but i still recommend reading [ this article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/opinion/krugman-europes-austerity-madness.html ) by paul krugman . 
  and if you do n't agree , at least tell me your arguments instead of just downvoting . 
  i have n't seen very convincing ones so far . 
  did n't mean to say you did . 
  just wanted to clarify that because you did n't mention it and not everyone is familiar with the actual first gulf war . 
   but otherwise , which war has iran fought recently , other than the one against the non-democratic state of iraq ? 
  to be fair , they were attacked in that one . 
  ca n't really blame a state for being attacked . 
  huh ? 
  they ca n't really wiretap skype . 
  their only instrument to monitor skype calls is a trojan of some sort . 
  either the infamous bundestrojaner or , almost the same , `` quellen-telekommunikations\u00fcberwachung '' . 
  both require physical access to the target system . 
  it 's a lot more invasive than a classic wiretap . 
  or did i miss some recent development ? 
  you 're mixing up a few things here . 
  i do n't mean to be offensive , just feel like it should be corrected . 
  first , [ according to their own statements ] ( http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/mitglieder ) , they have about 34.000 members . 
  and i 'd wager a lot of those are n't active anymore , seeing how they have trouble getting a lot of their members to pay their yearly party contribution . 
   secondly , the petition is not about acta , it 's about some [ obscure law brought up by some publishers who basically want money from google ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leistungsschutzrecht ) . 
  although i agree members of the pirate party ** should ** care about it , apparently public interest in stopping this is n't all that big . 
  and the quorum to get a public hearing is 50.000 signatures , not 30.000 . 
  i still agree that it is quite a fail that they did n't even fulfill the quorum though . 
   and , fyi , that report was released months ago . 
  if the pirates havent picked it up till now , they never will . 
  they are much to busy with infighting and electing the most repulsing , embarassing 20-somehting hipsters they can find to elect into representative positions . 
  * sigh * so true it hurts . 
  expel them from the eu , impose trade tariffs as `` repayment '' for the lost loans and bonds , for example . 
  edit : that 's what i 'd expect them to do in case greece defaults or leaves the euro . 
  if your question was what they could do instead of what they are doing now , i honestly have no clear answer , but some sort of structured default is probably the only way . 
  austerity obviously does n't work very well .
