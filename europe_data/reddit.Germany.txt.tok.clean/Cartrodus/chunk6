  yeah , trust me , the german government would n't allow a greek default just like that . 
  it would blow up the banking system all over europe worse than the default of lehman brothers did blow up the us banking system . 
  yes , everyone who does n't agree with me is retarded . 
  great discussion culture . 
   it appears that whenever this subject pops up , the name calling starts . 
  the `` opposition '' rarely has any decent arguments pro multiculturalism . 
  all they do is go around flailing their hands and screaming `` racist racist racist uliuliuli '' . 
  yeah , you 're overexaggerating a liiittle bit here . 
  i know what you mean . 
  i just do n't experience that kind of thinking in my personal life much , but that 's obviously a perception bias on my part . 
  even my grandma does n't talk bad about poles , and she actually was driven out of ( now polish ) pommerania after world war ii . 
  and though i agree with you that there is a lot of latent and not so latent racism and xenophobia present in germany , i do n't know if i 'd say that germany is any more xenophobic than any other european country . 
  some people think like that . 
  not all . 
  i 'm german and actually like poland , for example . 
  been to krakau and loved the city . 
  good beer too !, 
   do n't have any issues with poles coming to germany either . 
  i think it 's mainly the older generation that still has some old stereotypes and views you in a bad light , but that 's changing too . 
  depends . 
  what were the historical reasons for letting them in ? 
  i can speak for germany : we needed cheap labor during an economic boom . 
  they provided that nicely . 
  nobody ever cared if they learn german or not or learn our rules and values beyond what is needed to function at a simple job . 
  nobody ever encouraged them to either . 
  but they lived here . 
  founded families here . 
  made their home here . 
  their children and grandchildren could n't function if they were sent back to where they originally came from . 
  and now that there are no more simple jobs and it is actually necessary to actually educate them , they are left hanging . 
  they are growing up in a climate of unemployment , low education , anger and frustration , also a feeling of not belonging . 
  society always tells them to adapt , but is n't doing much to help ( you are free to correct me on that , i 'd be very eager to hear of integration programs that are well funded and effective ) . 
  i have to admit i have no clue whether we still accept immigrants from countries like that who are n't part of families that are already here ( i doubt it though ) , but even that could be turned into productive contribution to society , it takes some effort to educate them and help them to learn how our society works first , though . 
  you ca n't expect uneducated low class people to suddenly turn into educated exemplary citizens just because they switch countries . 
  another nice example is the [ blaming of jews for the black death ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism#persecutions_in_the_middle_ages ) during the middle ages . 
  it seems that it is human nature to look for easy scapegoats . 
  meh , it 's not a general problem with immigration . 
  it obviously has cultural , economical and social reasons and is completely dependent on how immigration is structured . 
  but usually , immigrants from countries that are way below the wealth level of europe end up in the lowest class of society in european countries , and that 's generally the class where crime comes from . 
  if you have nothing to lose , crime seems like a good way out . 
  most of the offenses by those immigrants are probably drug and criminal gang related , and if you think illegal drug trafficking and organized crime would stop if we just got rid of immigrants , you are quite naive . 
  they would just be replaced by native people from low levels of society . 
  tl ; dr : selection bias, 
  ironically , they still refer to democratic socialism even in their current program . 
  it 's just an empty shell , though . 
  okay , that 's much more similar to germany than i would have expected , but still somewhat better . 
  percentage for unemployment benefits here is 60 % to 67 % , depending on various circumstances . 
  no limiting factor for higher incomes ( although it 's capped eventually ) , but it 's debatable whether that 's a good thing or not . 
   something i 'm really curious about : did the labour liberalization have the benefits it is supposed to have ? 
  is it now easier to get a new position as a result of it ? 
  is the labour market really more flexible now ? 
  low paying jobs here are mainly created by using loopholes in new legislation that sprung up in the past years and allow the employers to skip having to pay social security contributions or allow them to circumvent wages set by unions . 
  i wo n't go into details since that would probably be boring . 
  but it 's used on jobs that ca n't be outsourced . 
  cashiers , cleaning personnel , warehouse workers , service workers in general . 
  yeah , but you have strong working social security in place to litigate the liberalized labour market , do n't you ? 
  in germany , for example , if you get fired , you get unemployment benefits as a percentage of your last wage for 1 year . 
  after that year , you fall into basic welfare benefits , which are ** much ** lower and basically only cover basic needs . 
  and it 's not that easy for all people to find a new decent job within 1 year , partly because our labour market is much more strict . 
  you do n't have much incentive to hire new employees when you ca n't fire them in case the economic situation worsens and you have trouble paying them . 
  there 's labour liberalization going on here too , but that mostly creates low wage jobs without social security . 
  i think the nordic countries are handling it a lot better . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  that said , i 'd prefer it if the whole of europe moved back to more social democracy ... 
  the us have different issues though . 
  much less population density than europe . 
  it 's just not cost-effective to have several providers in most regions of the us because there 's not enough population to make several competitors profitable . 
  that said , the situation in us metropolitan areas shows that their oligopoly stems from more issues than just that one . 
  there needs to be tough regulation by the administration to prevent oligopolies from forming , obviously . 
  but the eu tends to provide that much better than the us government so far . 
  [ only 34.9 % of non-european descent , though . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amsterdam#inhabitants_by_origin ) still a pretty high number , of course . 
  all countries in the eu have moved in the direction of more market orientation in the past decades though . 
  by comparison , the nordic countries are still a lot more equalitarian than germany , france or , even worse , the uk . 
  the usual . 
  germans and french could n't agree on anything and blew up the whole project . 
  germans continued on their own with a project named theseus , but as far as i am aware nothing ever came of it . 
  no clue whether the french continued anything on their own . 
  the debt values given there are pretty low . 
  according to [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/2-23072012-ap/en/2-23072012-ap-en.pdf ) it 's ~ 81 % of gdp for germany . 
  much higher for italy too . 
  wonder where the large difference comes from . 
  how was the quality of the translations measured , exactly ? 
  edit : since the link to the [ study ] ( http://www.mt-archive.info/mts-2009-koehn-1.pdf ) got posted by now i can answer my question myself . 
  they use [ bleu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bleu ) . 
  what the hell is a pureblood french ? 
  100 % celtic ? 
  100 % norman ? 
  100 % frank ? 
  or maybe 100 % basque ? 
  i 'm not really sure about the technical details , but is n't this totally pointless anyway as long as all the pictures of the users are stored on facebook 's servers ? 
  all they have to do is rerun their software and scan the images again if they ever want to recover that data ? 
  well she did defend the actions of her publisher the day it happened . 
  said it was obvious that the publisher would do it and she does n't see a contradiction to the party platform . 
  that reaction was what really kicked the whole thing off , at least for me . 
  i think a lot of the longing for the d-mark is n't actually because they want the currency back , but because they want the old times back . 
  a lot of things that actually have nothing to do with the euro get blamed on it . 
  the wages of most people in germany have either stagnated or shrunk a bit in the course of the past decade . 
  people just feel like everything is more expensive because of the euro , when in reality it feels more expensive because of other factors , like inflation and the relative absence of wage increases in wide areas of the german economy . 
  obviously in addition to that the whole euro crisis and bailouts for other countries , which back in the day was guaranteed as ** never ** being able to happen by the politicians who were responsible for introducing the euro , do n't exactly help its popularity in germany right now .
