wow , thank you very much for taking the time to write that up !, 
  :d of course !, 
  it really only took about 20 minutes . 
  i had a tour about the subject and still a lot of the links . 
  i just forgot that i had n't saved it . 
  :d  if i can ask a quick follow up question , you say `` the next elections are expected to be held in 2019 ; however , this situation may change due to uk 's brexit . '', 
      is it very unusual for an election to be called early ? 
  in canada we have a system where we 're supposed to have elections at least every 4 years , but it 's pretty normal for the government to call one earlier for various political reasons . 
  * coughs * another long answer  as far as i know they are still scheduled to be held in 2019 , there is no special date : [ europarl.europa.eu ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/20150201pvl00036/elections ) why i brought it up , is that there will be a lot of necessary changes to organizing the next elections : first , due to the outcome of the brexit referendum , the british are not going to vote . 
  the english for sure , the scottish have been thinking publicly if they would stay in the uk or the eu , this seemed like a reason to argue the question of independance again . 
  so , now in the eu-parliament every faction is discussing the budget changes - because there is fewer eu tax income . 
  will the share remain the same ? 
  who will pay less , who will pay more ? 
  this may also be fuel for other eu-independentists ... and there are still 13 other member states having national elections in 2017-2019 !, 
  this is counting without all the local elections ( finland is electing both president in 2018 , and parliament in 2019 ) , 1 candidate member ( serbia ) , and 4 associated members ( liechtenstein , norway , moldova , and turkey ) . 
  also germany has been a driving force in keeping this all runing , and the chancellor is facing heavy competition in september ... fortunately , the biggest contender is social democrat martin schulz , who was president of the eu parliament until january . 
  a lot is happening !, 
  ____ ** tl ; dr ** -- `` long talk , short thought '' - another german saying :d i am saying that it will be rough until the next eu elections because of massive budget changes due to the greek crisis , the brexit , and the anti-eu climate while there will be 13 national elections until 2019 . 
  now i get it !, 
   very noble of you to consider postal voting !, 
  i hope you guys make smart choices - for all us , but especially for the netherlands !, 
  but the elctions are scheduled for 2019 ? 
  one of our popular sayings in germany is `` there are no dumb questions , there are only dumb answers . '', 
  also - i 'm sorry that it took so long to answer , had this written down when you asked , but then i started formatting , and then i got a phone call ...  ** tl ; dr ** - faq about the eu , the institutions , and how europeans vote & official video `` the european parliament in 40 seconds '' . 
  ___ *** how does the eu work ? 
  *** basically , in the [ treaty on european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_european_union ) we have all the main national institutions ( executive , legislative , judiciary ) , but on an international or supra-national level . 
  they work as if the eu was a federal republic ( like the us ) with a * two chamber parliament * ( like france , and many others ) would - provided it had a * collective head of state * ( like switzerland ) , and a * rotation of the head of state * ( like the former holy roman empire ) . 
  ___ *** who 's in charge ? 
  *** then are [ 40 agencies of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agencies_of_the_european_union ) , and the 7 eu treaty institutions : 1 . 
  ** eu parliament ** - * ( legislative , from the people ) * is the directly elected parliament , it *** represents the people *** . 
  the eu parliament 's president is german martin schulz , who was elected from the parliament 's members in 2012 . 
  ** european council ** - * ( executive ) * all the heads of member states ' government ( plus two others ) , has no formal legislative power - *** acts as a collective `` head of state '' with rotating presidency *** . 
  since december 2014 the current president of the european council is donald tusk , the former prime minister of poland . 
  ** council of the eu ** * ( legislative , from the governments ) * is the not-directly elected parliament , *** represents the governments *** of the member states . 
  the presidency of the council of the eu is currently held by the maltese government . 
  ** commission ** - * ( executive ) * a president is proposed by the european council ( presidency ) , and elected by the eu parliament ( people ) . 
  the council of the eu then nominates one member per member state , which are then approved by the eu parliament . 
  it *** operates as a cabinet government *** . 
  the current president of the eu commision is luxembourgs former prime-minister jean-claude juncker elected in 2014 . 
  ** european court of justice ** - * ( judiciary ) * hears applications from national courts *** acts as supreme court *** and hears applications for annulment . 
  ** european central bank ** - *** administers monetary policy *** . 
  since 2011 the president of the european central bank is mario draghi , an italian economist . 
  ** court of auditors ** - has no judicial functions , is an external investigatory audit agency . 
  law professor v\u00edtor manuel da silva caldeira from portugal is the president of the european court of auditors since 2008 . 
  ___ *** how do europeans vote ? 
  *** as a european citizen , it is common that you get to vote on presidential elections ( unfortunately not in germany ) , general elections for the government ** ( head of government and/or parliament ) , local and municipal elections ( which are in some cases open to resident foreigners ) - and the europe-wide national elections for the eu parliament . 
  the next elections are expected to be held in 2019 ; however , this situation may change due to uk 's brexit . 
  and we 're waiting to see if the grrek go ahead with a grexit , and if the french vote for le pen , and she 'll go ahead with a frexit . 
  so ... it does not get dull . 
   ___ from the eu parliament youtube channel [ `` the european parliament in 40 seconds '' ] ( https://youtu.be/bnlk64e4fco ) & playlist [ `` how it works '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhqxk2yvsfvtjrqmoj1nq-wymfu7goqk8 ), 
  as a tourist , i have experienced this . 
  very confusing for us southern germans / austrians , when we travel continental scandinavia ( dk/no/se ) . 
  the spoken languages and especially danish and norwegian in writing seem too similar to us and we easily mix them up , when we try to speak a bit . 
  it 's frustrating , when everyone politely answers in english or german , because we feel that we butchered it up too much . 
  you know one good thing about the eu is that we are in this together . 
  look , it may not seem like it , but your struggle is our struggle , and it will help . 
  eventually . . 
  i do n't believe that it is your nature , but i do believe it may take time to develop a political culture of more responsibility and accountability . 
  you 'll see it happen , trust me . 
  it will happen !, 
  you are right , i agree . 
  there 's a huge gap between conservativism and the extreme-right . 
  but i was trying to find an answer to the question from someone from the netherlands , on why in our regional politics `` nazi '' and/or `` kommunist '' are effective slanders to political opponents if so . 
  wants conservative voters to like his rhetorics . 
  hofer and the fp\u00d6 can not rely on extreme-right vote on the federal level , he needed to cater to conservative and centrist voters , so he resorted to this . 
  the austrian and bavarian conservatives fear both nazis and communists . 
  why am i getting downvoted on this ? 
  lol, 
  conservatives in bavaria , austria and switzerland , despise both groups equally , for what we perceive as the same policy : denial of or hate for individualism , demonization of free enterprise , denial of freedom of religious choice , denial of regional traditions and historic roots , glorification of state leaders , glorification of war , glorification of the state as a undemocratic and not-endling one-party-system , etc. 
  for us , nazis and communists/socialists are pretty much the same and we fight them at all cost . 
  came here to find other people nagging about the missing almdudler ( a ) and rivella ( ch ) !, 
  sorry for assuming . 
  hahaha !, 
  well the towel law is a fun little competition and an awesome douglas adams reference !, 
  when my colleagues and i are travelling in germany outside of our home state , we sometimes take one with our [ subnational motif ] ( https://www.amazon.de/dp/b00i9cwvvm/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_tb3zzbh86kpq6 ) with us and try to make up all sorts of ridiculous claims , likr `` i am allowed to disregard your drinking rules '' , `` i have a constitutional right to get free pretzels with my food '' , `` remember when we fought the prussians/french for you , you owe us a round of beer '' ... other german people usually laugh , and give into our demands ( `` well , that makes sense obviously , go ahead then '' or `` here you go '' ) the towel says `` 1 square metre of freestate of bavaria '' in german . 
  he ment / u/qwerk33 who you originally answered to . . 
  as a german , i had to laugh !, 
  we do n't really get upset and triggered , but we can get a bit aufgesetzt and ausgel\u00f6st ... great comments to answer the `` ten bombers '' situation !, 
  looking at you , / u/therufmeistergeneral and / u/wolflisk daumens up !, 
   1 ) grate the carrot ( or dice it way way smaller )   2 ) you mix the pasta and sauce before serving . 
  well what about the fermented cabbage and the blood sausages then , when do you add those ? 
   i just know that the czechs respect their beer , and the quality on offer in prague was much higher than lisbon . 
  afaik a lot of the portuguese beer has the same producer ... perhaps a relict from the time when most companies were state-run . 
  i do miss all the different sized bottles here in germany ( mini , media , ... ) we mostly get only 0,3 l bottels , or 0,5 l here in bavaria . 
  i 'd like to buy my ma\u00df ( 1l or quart ) in one glass bottle !, 
   tankova is a good way of serving beer if you treat it well . 
  you guys do realize that both czech pilsener and portuguese bock are similar types of german beers right ? 
  the belgian beers are the crazy ones !, 
  i recommend everyone to google `` vandervelde liquor laws '' , this belgian minister was a literal socialist that made the industry come up with completely revolutionary ( pun intended ) ways to brew especially strong beer to circumvent the definition of what barely legally is still beer . 
  never be imprecise when ordering a pint in a belgian caf\u00e9 you guys !, 
  they use * fermented fruits * as gravity , for sake !, 
  * side note : even coming from bavaria/salzburg , i drink and love both sagres , super bock , urquell and budvar so i promise i am fairly impartial on this . 
  we bavarians brew strong beer during lent ( it gets up to 10 \u00b0 / \u00b0 \u00b0 alc ) and drink perhaps 2l max of those for `` religious purposes '' . 
  while belgians will chug a sixer of those any thursday evening in front of the tv . 
  i have seen guys get up drive after drinking the equivalent of 4 bottles of wine in 30 mins . 
  we did try to intervene , but could n't properly stand up and say people words . 
  * _____ edit : sorry for the bad alc unit , it 's not \u00b0 / \u00b0 \u00b0 until you drink it . 
  even 99 years after the end of wwi the british use the danish and dutch cultures to cut their eternal germanic foe ... there is still an ongoing debate whetger the german dogge/great dane comes from germany or not . 
  interestingly the same thing happened the other way around when netherlands and britain were at war , thousands of people became `` dutch '' , similar to `` deutsch '' , because the germans were perceived as the good guy back then . 
  but nothing beats my favorite story of the winter flyers at stockholm airport explaining to new arrivals the differences between sweden and switzerland ( `` no mountains , but awesome nature '' ) and that they can get cheap flights to norway if they still want to ski .
