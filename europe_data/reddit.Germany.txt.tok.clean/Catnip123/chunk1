'' * give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
  send these , the homeless , tempest-tossed to me : i lift my lamp beside the golden door . 
  you are quite correct , sir . 
  even if the actual numbers are hard to verify , 10-11 million is probably a much more realistic estimate of the victims of the holocaust , with the jews just being the largest group amongst others like : russians , gypsies , homosexuals , dissidents , pacifists , mental patients , communists etc etc. 
  that 's why it enrages me so much when people reduce the holocaust to `` just '' the jews ... because , it sounds like genocide was n't the problem , just that the nazis picked the wrong targets , otherwise it would have been ok ... 
  also heinrich l\u00fcbke , president from 1959 to 1969 . 
   according to the most famous anecdote , in 1962 he addressed a crowd in liberia : `` ladies and gentlemen , dear negroes ... '' . 
  while you surely know more about the topic than me , ( i just read an article about petain a while ago ) i ' m really wondering if your unconditional hatred of this man is fair and justified . 
  he appears to me more as a tragic , almost shakespearian figure . 
  in wwi , petain fought in verdun - arguably one of the largest and most horrible massacres in the history of mankind . 
  and even though he won , he witnessed first hand the horrible price of this victory - almost one million casualties within 9 months , senselessly thrown into the meat grinder . 
  petain did everything to avoid a second verdun when wwii started . 
  we do n't know if more frenchmen would have died if they had fought tooth and nail over every inch of their country ( like they did in wwi ) - but neither could petain know when he had to make this decision . 
  he had to chose between life and death for millions ; and after his experiences from verdun , he chose `` life '' , no matter the cost . 
  maybe it was the wrong decision , but i can understand why he thought this would be the more humane solution . 
  but . . but . . but ... what about global warning ? 
  why all the effort to claim a land that is slowly melting away anyway ? 
  and germany was the place to go for almost everything before ww1 . 
  people tend to forget that despite the prevalent militarism , pre-ww1 germany was one of the most modern and liberal countries in the world . . center of the international [ art scene ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/der_blaue_reiter ) and movie industry , advanced in technology and science , the first ever country with an organized welfare and health care system ... and it all went to shit so quickly . 
  hey , come on , it was an austrian who killed hitler ... you should be proud of that !, 
  but then again , one could significantly reduce the expenses for military pensions by just losing the war ... 
  such is life in motherland ... 
  or maybe it 's just the fact that scotland was one of the very few countries that was * not * ravaged by your dothraki hordes in the middle ages and you kind of feel you left them out ? 
   it 's our government that makes it insufferable for us . 
  yeah , we tried to help you guys getting rid of your government several times already , but then you did n't like that either ... 
  maybe you just misunderstood ? 
  4 terms was the longest time that a chancellor has ever had here ( helmut kohl ) , but there is no law against a fifth or sixth term . 
  but even the most conservative germans tend to get fed up with their leaders over such a long time , so i do n't think anyone will ever have more than 4 terms . 
  nope , you can run for chancellor as often as the voters do n't get tired of you . 
  no limitation in terms . 
  i think sch\u00e4uble would not be a very likely candidate - he 's too old and not very popular . 
  then again , we have the international [ franco-german brigade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-german_brigade ) for over 20 years already . 
  looks like a good start . 
  in the long run having completely separate national armies within the eu is just redundant and a waste of money . 
  really ? 
  i mean , like , bismarck was a strong and ruthless leader with a strong agenda ... merkel gets criticized all the time for not showing leadership at all , for only re-acting instead of acting when it would be appropriate . 
  do n't forget that most european countries were ruled by only a few noble families and many of the wars were like family affairs on a greater scale . 
  still blows my mind that in ww i , the leaders of britain , russia and germany were not only related by blood , but also grew up together as children ... 
  while bombing sounds a bit harsh , i 've always advocated for repeating the nuremberg trials every 50 years or so . 
  having your political and economical elites executed does wonders to your society and is - albeit a bit drastic - the best cure for corruption and nepotism . 
  even more impressive , still today you have smaller , remote villages in palatinate where most families have the very same last name - it 's because they were reduced to so few survivors that incest had to ensue to re-populate those areas . 
  i just tried to find the exact amount , all i got was that it has been a total of about 72 billion by 2015 . 
  most of those payment however are individual pensions for surviving victims , so i believe they will decline every year since that generation is dying off . 
  the style is called `` gr\u00fcnderzeit '' meaning `` foundation age '' , since those houses where build just after the foundation of the german empire after the franco-german war of 1871 . 
  germany extorted some hefty reparations out of the defeated french and invested most of it into these beautiful buildings that you will find in every major german city . 
  funny how people used to spend their money before the invention of offshore holding firms , huh ? 
  could be worse - they could have used a picture of cameron diaz instead . 
  if we die , we simply get [ reincarnated in argentina ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dppvdxu.png ) . 
  the article says ** kohl ** but the picture shows ** schmidt ** ... someone 's confusing our ex-chancellors . 
  but since schmidt died last year , it really should n't be that hard anymore ... 
  political marriages should n't be a thing of the past . 
  mutti should marry erdogan to create the glorious fourth reich ... 
  the fdp had changed more towards neoliberal than simply liberal within the last decades . 
  after the global banking crisis , a party that still advocates further deregulation of the economy and banking system was widely seen as a part of the problem , not the solution . 
  also , their last chairman guido westerwelle was probably the least popular politician we had for a long , long time . 
  smug and arrogant douchebag . 
  it is , but , at least for me as a german , the fines for not registering are kind of ridiculous . . something around 50 $ if i remember correctly ... 
  agreed . 
  william ii was the wrong man at the wrong place and the wrong time . 
  well , as far as i know both france and the uk used to be the main powers of europe and used all their influence for centuries to maintain a favorable balance of power on the continent . 
  when the clusterfuck of german states formed a powerful modern nation state , it made a lot of people very angry and was widely regarded as a bad move . 
  at least for wwi you can not blame germany alone , one important reason was that the former european superpowers wanted to weaken the new german empire to re-establish the old status quo . 
  just an idea : how about we get rid of those european elections by combining them with national elections ? 
  too many elections tend to tire the people , and the incentive to vote for the european parliament is n't very high currently - if both national and european ballots were handed out at the same instance , we might see a much higher voter turnout and also save a lot of money . 
  of course , things might get a little more complicated in the european parliament because of constantly shifting majorities - but then again , that would force them to keep negotiating their policies across party lines , which probably would n't be a bad thing for democracy . 
  it says `` syrian refugees '' . 
  a huge part ( probably even the majority ) of migrants here in germany do not come from syria . 
   an hymn up until now i did n't realize that the lack of a common hymn or anthem was an issue . 
  so , uh , i think we could all agree on [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1wj3tqri6y ) then , no ? 
  even better , use our nazi superscience \u2122 to create a machine that turns migrants into zerglings . 
  problem solved . 
  duh , that part was meant as a joke ... 
  yeah , but i 'm talking about the g36 here , the actually good and modern rifle . 
  as an assault rifle , it was never designed for continuous autofire and yet decreasing precision after longer autofire was the reason to scrap the whole project . 
  an assault rifle is not a machine gun ffs !, 
   germany doesnt need more military hmmm ... let 's see : the eu is probably falling apart within the next years ; depending on who wins the next us presidency big brother america will be no longer interested to leeroy into any conflict on its own , and russian media pick up the news story about the german-russian girl that was allegedly raped here and see russian interests in danger ... nah , we need an army , more than ever . 
   did i forget sth ? 
  maybe that those assault rifles were actually fine and working as intended , ** yet still got scrapped ** . 
  probably a political move by ursula ( she always reminds me of cersei lannister , does she even have a brother ? ), 
  to take a piss on her predecessor and increase her chances to one day become chancellor ... 
  i 'm not even opposed to legit economic migrants , we 've been taking them in since forever and it went mostly well . 
  but the point is , about 50 % of the current wave of `` migrants '' have not even registered with our authorities or have done this multiple times for multiple identities . 
  in my opinion that kind of behavior makes no sense whatsoever for a person who legitimately wants to integrate and start a new life here . 
  but it makes a lot of sense for people who just want to grab what they can as fast as possible at the expense of everybody else ... 
  i am a little confused why the opium wars did n't make it into the list . 
  using drugs as a weapon and making about 25 % of the male chinese populace addicted should account at least for something , no ? 
  actually a lot of very valid points in this post . 
  i think one of the main problems with german culture is that a lot of our most talented people chose to emigrate to the us when the nazis took power - one of the reasons hollywood became so big and germany still has n't fully recovered from that . 
   in my personal opinion , germany is an incredibly boring country . 
   they could have been the japan of europe ... bitch , pls . 
  from 1939 to 1945 we were so japanese our genitals became pixelated ... , 
  i was thinking mostly of the euro crisis , but that has been going on for some years and maybe is still not resolved entirely . 
  i 'm ok with that . 
   jews were n't polish since your username is `` poland for the poles '' am i right to assume that this means you want to get rid of your jewish population ? 
  that 's pretty cool , just tell them they 're always welcome here in germany . 
  the jewish communities integrate perfectly here and have been nothing but an asset to us for the last decades . 
  we 'll take your well educated jews any time over those illiterate north african troublemakers that mix among the genuine refugees . 
   i dislike merkel , i think her handling of the eurozone crisis was poor and made things worse . 
  additionally it showed a total lack of leadership imo . 
  i also disagree with the way she is handling the refugee crisis .
