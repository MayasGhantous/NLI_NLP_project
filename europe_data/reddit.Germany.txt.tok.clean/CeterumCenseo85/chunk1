paris in general , except for the louvre , which is incredibly amazing !, 
  it can also be used for romantic relationships , but it 's primary use and meaning is for someone you feel very close to in a platonic way . 
  someone you share the same view of the world with , someone who will always know what you are thinking etc. 
  people use it in romantic context because a seelenverwandter is the ideal partner for a romantic relationship . 
  you outlawed frying stuff  2.000 m ? 
  or am i being trolled here ? 
  people here often use it but instead of going up with the voice in the end like the french original , we go down . 
  so it comes out more like `` merceh '' . 
   no `` pommes '' ( fries ) at a cabin at about 2.000 meter above sea level there are not ? 
  how come ? 
  i think a couple languages sometimes use it . 
  in my dialect of german it 's also used at times , even though it 's pronounced slightly different . 
   sylvester * silvester, 
  nothing or socks, 
  this summer has been hot at times , but it 's still not anywhere as crazy as 2003 was . 
  another interesting fact : the german and english versions are pretty close , but the end is a bit darker in the german one : ** english : ** 99 dreams i have had in every one a red balloon it 's all over and i 'm standin ' pretty in this dust that was a city if i could find a souvenir just to prove the world was here ... and here is a red balloon i think of you and let it go . 
  ** german original ( translated ) : *** 99 years of war left no place for winners secretaries of war are no more neither are jet fighters today i 'm wandering around and see the world in shatters found a balloon think of you and let if fly, 
  what 's the name of this song ? 
  funny enough , our best performers of the last ~ 20 years have been guys like guildo horn and stefan raab . 
  not to mention lena , operated by stefan raab . 
  my local butcher has a meat vending machine in front of his shop , so people can buy meat for spontaneous sunday grill parties . 
  rarely . 
  most partying takes place at some public place . 
  `` ancestry '' is n't a category we think in . 
  especially not in the way a lot of americans do . 
  to us , americans are just americans . 
  just because several generations ago someone 's forefathers used to live here it does n't mean that we would look onto their nowadays actions in a different way . 
  back in the 90s we had a lot of bosnian refugees in my local football team , but i guess you 're implicitly referring to current middle eastern refugees . 
  only time i 've meet one was on a train when the ticket controlling guy did n't speak english so i translated between him and a group of refugees . 
  they had accidentally bought the wrong ticket and had to pay a fine . 
  they were initially quite confused but once i had explained it they were super understanding and thankful . 
  just looked it up and they actually do live there and have the citizenship . 
  other than the swiss guards , the vatican also has a couple other non-clerical people with citizenship . 
  does that also apply to the swiss guards ? 
  i 'd guess it does n't . 
  writing in dialect is so horrible . 
  it 's like someone 's trying really hard to really go over the top with their identity and dialect . 
  50k maybe buys you a permanent parking spot in downtown munich :-o, 
  we also have krampus in germany . 
  it 's a bad guy who comes visit children with st. nikolaus on 6th of december . 
  st. nikolaus is a nice guy who brings you sweets and stuff , but also tells you what you did wrong this year . 
  krampus is his super intimidating side-sick . 
  it 's basically a good cop/bad cop scheme . 
  thing is , krampus is * really * intimidating . 
  he usually brings a big back and threatens to put you in it and either take you away or drown you in a river , but then st. nikolaus will usually say a couple nice things about you to calm him down again . 
  as a child krampus scared the shit out of me . 
  that 's what i 'm referring to . 
  that really would n't fly in europe . 
  technically both ways of saying it are correct , but the latter ones sounds really clumsy ; kinda like i imagine a child pointing a finger at himself and declaring `` ich bin ein engl\u00e4nder ! '', 
  agreed . 
  this american thing with ethnicity and race is always a bit uncomfortable/weird . 
  i remember there recently was a tweet by some american celebrity about `` us all being the same , no matter which gender , religion , race or country . '', 
  it was put up on tv on some german show , but the moderator was placed right in front of the word `` race '' so they would n't have to speak about that . 
  when they translated it , they also just left out `` race '' since it 's really not a category we think in over here . 
  i 've seen forms in the us that asked people to fill in their race . 
  you did something like this in germany , your company would probably in the news for it . 
  it 's certainly no mistake , both are grammatically correct . 
  i would even argue that the use of `` ein '' gives it even stronger meaning in jfk 's context . 
  saying `` ich bin ** ein ** berliner '' makes it feel even more intense , creating a feeling of him being a member of the community of berlin citizens . 
  whereas if you just say `` ich bin berlin '' that 's more about yourself and where you are from . 
  came here with exactly this in mind . 
  have you looked at the guys comment history ? 
  you 're wasting your time with someone who thinks and argues in categories like `` leftists '' and `` liberals '' . 
  when we take about different christians groups in germany , 99 % of times the distinction is just `` katholisch or evangelisch '' , like you mentioned . 
  some people might note that they are a specific kind of `` evangelisch '' but it 's not the norm . 
  i also do n't really see the use of a helicopter for reporting traffic jams or the weather . 
  it comes across as purely something they purely use for show and effect instead of actually having a proper use . 
  german radio stations will tell you down to the minute how much extra time you need to plan for any traffic jam and whether it would make sense to leave the autobahn and drive around it . 
  and you certainly do n't need helicopters for that . 
  norbert lammert is one of the greatest representatives of parliamentary democracy we have ever had . 
  i could not see myself voting for his party by quite a long shot , but he is one of the most respectable and admirable politicans of our times . 
  for merkel , i used to think very lowly of her because of her domestic politics , but her international politics are something i appreciate her for quite a lot . 
  no idea , really . 
  i know my grandparents , but beyond them i barely know the name of any of my grand-grandparents ; let alone where they came from/lived or what they did for a living . 
  a lot of people pick their own berries , but it of course depends on where you live . 
  not that much berry picking in inner cities , but if you have a garden , many of use are growing strawberries , blueberries , raspberries and/or ribes ( `` johannis berries '' ) there . 
  yosemite ? 
  leipzig and dresden are amazing cities and i think as long as you can land a decent shop you 'd have an awesome life there . 
  erfurt is also another great place . 
  the `` bad '' places are lots of mid-sized cities where it 's hard to find work even if you 're medium-qualified . 
  and even if you do , it 's pretty boring to live there because there 's little to do . 
  while still officially part of east berlin , it is * very * different from the rest of east germany . 
  they 're pretty much the same thing . 
  `` oida '' is pretty common in bavaria/austria . 
  it 's like the equivalent of `` dude ! '', 
  `` the stockholm bloodbath '' either sounds like a band name or an fps map . 
  any specific part ? 
  insurance will still cover all of your neccessary treatments but anything on top will have to come out of your pocket . 
  depending on how regularly had visited the dentist before , insurance might pay between nothing and a significant percentage of those costs . 
  also `` neccessary '' does n't include stuff like implants etc. 
  my friends and i spent a lot of time planning a 2 week trip to norway last year . 
  in the end it just was too expensive so we went to scotland instead . 
  i 've never been to norway , but scotland was * amazing * . 
  german here . 
  i always found it weird that the us apparently does n't have any name laws . 
  over here we got two which boil down two : 1 ) you ca n't pick a name that will negatively impact your child 's life 2 ) the name must indicate gender . 
  if it 's a name that 's ambiguous ( like andrea ) you must add a second name that 's clear . 
  here 's a list of names that people tried to give to their child that were n't accepted . 
  note that some of these might fly today as they are always judged in the context of their time : satan , crazy horse , tailbone , harasser , carnation-twerp , peace-with-god-through-jesus-christ , whisky , woodstock , gastritis , january , yoghurt , cherry , mcdonald , carrot , peppermintia , porsche , doll , rumpelstiltskin , atomfried , 3,1415926 ... and woodruff . 
  pepper spray is also illegal in germany , mind you .
