  i remember in one of my last matches , i was up against a classmate . 
  after time had run out , none of us was able to put the other guy to his shoulders to win the match . 
  the referee announced `` next point wins '' -- my friend and i immediately matched eyes and i could totally tell he was thinking the same i did : * `` there 's points ?!, 
  '' * after that season i dropped out and went back into football . 
  to be fair , if the `` average '' german hears domstadt , they immediately think of cologne . 
  looking at the spectrum , that sounds like a reasonable estimate . 
  extreme right-wing economics are pretty much what social darwinism is . 
  * if * the us voting system was to change , it would only ever happen during a democrat-dominated house . 
  the gop 's survival is heavily dependent on the current system ; talk about gerrymandering and shit . 
  i understand that in the us `` dating '' is generally used to describe most non-married relationships . 
  in germany it 's usually used in different ways : as long as you 're just dating , that 's more like a pre-relationship thing . 
  as long as you are just `` dating '' someone , it 's still just the beginning of a potential relationship , but the two of you are still more of a loose , not fully committed thing . 
  it kinda goes like this : single =  dating =  `` together '' =  married, 
  only blackout i ever remeber having was this one in november 2006 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_european_blackout, 
  - milan - prague - paris - madrid for magic : the gathering tournaments . 
  am from munich . 
  depending on where in germany you 're from , swiss-german is barely understandable to you anymore . 
  sounds quite similar to our role of the president , except that our head of the military is either the secretary of defense ( peace time ) or the chancellor ( during war ) . 
  our president has disbanded the government before , but every time it was because the chancellor practically wanted it disbanded . 
  one of the most common mistake is not pronouncing the `` e '' at the end of a word . 
  most famously when english speakers try to pronounce `` porsche '' , it usually comes out as just `` porsch . '', 
  so if i work `` just '' monday-friday every week , i would n't be eligible for the full 24 days of paid vacation ? 
   days you usually do n't work at count as work days for it do i understand this correctly ? 
  if i usually work from monday till friday , then i will need to take off more than 10 days if i want to go on vacation for 2 weeks ? 
  asking because this is not how it works where i work , so i 'm curious . 
  it 's a common theme in travel guides about germany, 
  there 's a reason munich is considered the `` secret capital of germany ''  / edit : people downvoting should google [ `` secret capital of germany '' ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=the+secret+capital+of+germany&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=dsiowdkme-zvxtfctdac ), 
  berlin is considered one of the poorest/trashiest but in a way also coolest cities in germany . 
  the city itself is super poor , once leading its former mayor to coin the inofficial slogan of berlin : * `` poor , but sexy '' * but berlin being poor/trash is more of a meme , i think . 
  the city itself is kinda cool . 
  i think generally speaking , people consider many of the bigger cities in east germany to be trashy ( cottbus comes to mind ) , but i 'm not sure how much truth there is in that . 
  dresden and leipzig for example do n't carry that stigma . 
  did you ? 
  i thought the guy was asking whether anyone wished their country had lost some of its territory in the past . 
  bavarian here . 
  i knew this would be the top comment . 
  fellow munich checking in . 
  these days , you do n't live in the city anymore unless you somehow have money , your parents have money or your grandparents once bought an apartment in the city . 
  even if you 're looking at the tiniest imaginable 1 room apartments with 15m \u00b2 , chances are you 're competing with hundreds of other people for it . 
  and if you get it , it will probably be still above of what you could reasonably spend on it . 
  lots of my friends are living somewhere around the outskirts of the the town . 
  but even those are getting ridiculously expensive ; especially if they have an s-bahn connection . 
  no , nobody uses that . 
  the only other way to refer to it apart from the regular `` black-red-gold '' is `` black-red-awesome '' ( schwarz-rot-geil ) . 
  `` geil '' is s slang word that can mean both awesome as well as horny . 
  i remember the child book `` 10 kleine negerlein '' which is about a 10 black children who travel around the world , but in every place they go to one of them gets killed until only 1 last survives who then has 10 kids and the story repeats . 
  i just read up some of the text and it 's pretty violent : - one stabbed himself - one was shot - one was `` killed by a farmer '' - one was `` hexed away '' - one died of the flu - one drank to much beer and burst open - one was cooked in a pot - one had a brick dopped on his head - one was eaten by a crocodile ca n't believe my parents read that to me as a child . 
  at least in german , you definitely would n't call that bread . 
  [ this ] ( http://bilder.augsburger-allgemeine.de/img/wirtschaft/crop35555517/5537215109-ctopteaser/copy-20of-20fotolia-52578579-subscription-xxl.jpg ) is bread to us . 
  what op posted would be called `` toast '' here , no matter whether it 's toasted or not . 
  a friend of mine has italian citizenship through her father , but she grew up and spent all her life in germany . 
  she does n't even speak italian at all . 
  last year she eventually decided to apply for german citiczenship ( her mom is german ) but it still seems to a really lengthy and complicated process . 
  getting eu citizenship is no piece of cake . 
  you do n't happen to be a major football star , are you ? 
  that used to make things a lot easier . 
  i live ~ 5km from garching so i migth be biased , but here 's my take on the two cities itself : munich is an amazing city , especially the english garden + all the other things you can do during your free time . 
  downside : it 's so expensive , not a lot of people can afford it anymore unless you have some really good income . 
  i noticed you said you 'd be living in garching , but even garching is getting quite expensive . 
  on the upside , you 'd be really close to the tu and only something like a 15 minute u-bahn ride from the city center . 
  i do n't know , it 's not really something that 's `` present '' in our culture . 
  like , there 's probably hundreds of things i could buy and eat that i 'm unaware of , but since they 've not even crossed my mind in the first place , i 'm not getting them . 
  the first time i encountered peanut butter was when a girlfriend of mine had bought it . 
  i tried it and it was quite ok , but overall it 's one of those things you feel are probably unhealthy so subconsciously you stop buying them unless you really are into their taste . 
  was kind of the same with nutella for me . 
  i tried it , liked it , but eventually stopped buying it because of all the bad rep it gets . 
  suddenly valencia cf 's logo makes so much more sense . 
  a `` nickname '' hitler often used for himself was wolf . 
  apparently he often introduced himself to children as `` uncle wolf '' . 
  the guy who was `` refereeing '' that match later went to prison after being caught with a ton of drugs at some us airport . 
  how about the 1st of september 2001 , when they lost 0:1 to ireland , demolishing their chances at going to the 2002 wc ? 
  the live commentary of ireland scoring was even part of a german song about the dutch not qualifying . 
  [ which goal ? 
  ] ( http://sportige.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/goal-line-technology.jpg ), 
  we do and it freaked out a candian friend of mine . 
  merkel : `` hey really thought the brandenburger gate had a key . '', 
  i 'm german and i have no idea what you 're referring to . 
  i 've been to milan , florence and venice and i think it 's not even close : florence . 
  it 's one of the most beautiful cities i 've seen in my life . 
  ghent is amazing !, 
  i once flew there for a magic tournament , where we rented a house in the old town . 
  when we returned from the tournament site there was a * huge * festival there !, 
  ( they even hat `` spit burgers '' , which is something i would rather forget though ), 
  what you are saying is correct , but in the actual vote to decide the capital between frankfurt and bonn , adenauer `` tricked '' a couple of his party members into voting for bonn in order to swing the vote back in its favour ( frankfurt was winning ) : even though adenauer 's cdu/csu had a majority , their members from the state frankfurt is in ( hesse ) said they were gon na vote for frankfurt instead of bonn , which meant frankfurt , which was favored by the spd , would win . 
  very shortly before the actual election , adenauer gave some allegedly `` secret information '' to members of the press about the spd already celebrating their `` victory '' . 
  when this was published , the hesse cdu delegates got pissed and decided to vote for bonn on short notice , giving it the win . 
   is standard german considered to be the hamburg dialect ? 
  how different are berliner and bavarian dialects ? 
  definitely not . 
  in germany we usually say that the only place that actually speaks proper high german is hannover . 
  the hamburg dialect is very different from it and so is bavarian , to a point where tv shows will sometimes use subtitles if someone speaks with heavy dialect ( even though i 'm not sure that 's really necessary , but i 'm up from bavaria )  are the differences negligible ? 
  are you able to understand every possible dialect of german within germany ? 
  the differences are very real even though even among heavy dialect speakers , you will be able to understand each other if both sides show at least a tiny bit of effort . 
  otherwise , yes , there are dialects you wo n't understand . 
  i 'm from munich ( bavaria ) and if my landlord speaks to her relatives that are from the mosel-area ( rhineland-palatinate ) , i literally do n't understand a single thing they are talking about . 
  same thing when someone speaks * heavy * swiss dialect , even though switzerdeutsch borders on already being a language on its own anyway . 
  the other dialects i can understand , even though some might hurt my ears . 
   one last question . 
  how different is standard austrian german to standard german ? 
  not sure if there 's a `` standard '' austrian german since they have their own local dialcts , depending on where you are in the country .
