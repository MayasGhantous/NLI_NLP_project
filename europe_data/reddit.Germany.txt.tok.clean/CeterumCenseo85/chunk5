  people are arguing whether there should be a cap or not . 
  but it 's not really an issue of generations like you mentioned in your post . 
  there 's also some people arguing against helping the refugees who are already here but i do n't think that 's a real nation-wide difference ; more of a very vocal , extreme minority that the whole rest of the country strongly disagrees with . 
  other than that , i do n't really see any major differences . 
  maybe social equality will become a bigger topic again over the year since it 's election year and one of the two major parties has just selected a candidate from outside merkel 's government , that the party is still part of . 
  in the past they had used politicians from inside merkel 's government , which therefor were limited in how much criticism they would bring up . 
  from what i 've read about this , getting a living/working visa would be one of the biggest challenges . 
  eu companies ca n't hire you unless there 's no equally qualified person from inside the european union . 
  is the `` major '' the same as the name of the thing you are studying ? 
  latest york, 
   after technically getting it from the american occupation did they ? 
  as far as i know , hitler was officialled recorded as living in munich . 
  when he died , his inheritance fell to bavaria . 
  growing up playing football in germany , i know more swear words in turkish than in any other language . 
  at some point i made an actual effort to understand what they mean . 
  20 years later i still remember all that stuff , 
  true . 
  for the consumer it 's pretty much the same . 
  for business , they 're theoretically charged the vat at every step , but can then later reclaim it . 
  so practically they 're paying it , then getting it back on their tax return . 
  north : isle of skye , scotland south : durban , south africa west : new york , usa east : dubai , uae, 
  one should add that in most ( all ? ), 
  eu countries , there is no sales tax . 
  we use vat instead . 
  i never knew food could be arrogant . 
  now that 's surprising . 
  spain and greece , far and away . 
  their seafood is terrific and absolutely unmatched . 
  italy is also really good though . 
  for dessert : austria . 
  germany has had really bad experiences with more executive-heavy republics . 
  and i 'm not even referring to hitler , but the weimar republic that he eventually `` emerged '' from . 
  the weimar republic was infamous for the many different chancellors that were picked by the president , who often quickly fail only to see a new chancellor picked by the president . 
  in the end that was super inefficient because the chancellor had to work with the parliament but had too much of a hard time actually getting stuff done . 
  so instead we have parliament elect the chancellor now . 
   a bunch of bundes bunched together i like the word play , but the plural of `` bund '' would be `` b\u00fcnde '' , not `` bundes '' . 
   some asians, 
  that award should probably go to kenya for the amount of refugees from somalia ( and recently also south sudan ) they have been taking in for decades . 
  it 's a shame the international community has only ever half-heartedly recognized kenya 's effort and commitment with regards to this . 
  it 's almost as if expanding the eu has been mutually beneficial . 
  are you serious ? 
  what does skin color have to do with this ? 
  you 're probably surprised that both [ are correct ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/different-from-than-or-to ) . 
  because people hear `` from '' much more often they assume it 's the only valid way . 
  sorry man , but you 're really hard to follow . 
  i ased whether putting the auxilliary verb in front of the actual verb is different in english . 
  and then you post a setence that confirms that assumption . 
  so what are we talking about here ? 
  yeah , i got that . 
  just not sure what point i should take from it . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i mean , i know what you 're trying to say , but grammar-wise , that 's not a correct german sentence . 
  we learned both ; our text books always had vocabulary sections that showed both spellings , but only used be in actual texts . 
  our teachers always told us that we could use whatever we wanted as long as we were consistent with our choice of ae of be . 
  definitely [ mr vain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfwb_60lhw0 ) * i know what i want and i want it now * * i want you * * cause i 'm mr vain *, 
  we would say : `` ich mag keine hunde . '', 
  both are grammatically correct , but the later one sounds a bit more like a child would speak . 
  with `` m\u00f6gen '' we will rather use `` keine '' ( = `` i like no dogs '' ) instead of `` nicht '' ( = `` i do n't like dogs '' ) if we 're talking about a plural object . 
  if it was just a single dog it would just be : `` ich mag den hund nicht . '', 
  regarding `` hunde '' vs `` hunden '' , you use hunde because `` m\u00f6gen '' goes with the accusative case instead of the dative case . 
  practicing with google translator ? 
  you have some real dedication to learning the language , i 'm impressed . 
  i did the same with spanish for a while , but mostly just for random phrases i wanted to know and not some actual , dedicated practice . 
  would be the correct translation . 
  i 've never thought about where to place negatives , but do n't they go right in front of the verb in 99 % of cases ? 
  actually , now that i think about it , i 'm pretty sure they go in front of the verb in minor sentences , but behind the verb in major sentences . 
  can you give me an example where it would go in the very beginning of a sentence ? 
  but is that really different to english ? 
  they also put auxiliary verbs in front of the regular verb just like we do . 
  english , history and geography . 
  i love learning about the world . 
  social studies ( subject that teaches you about how our society/political system works ) was also super interesting until our teacher was arrested and we never got a replacement one for that subject . 
  there 's probably a lot of weirdly difficult things about german , but the sentence structure is something i would n't have thought about . 
  does n't it generally follow `` subject - verb - object '' in main sentences and `` subject - object - verb '' in minor sentences ? 
  ok , now that i typed it , i realize that english is much more flexible in what is considered correct and does n't differntiate between main and minor sentences . 
  til estonia literally has no future, 
  we even have an authority that will analyse current satellite data and historic maps for wherever you want to build something to find out how likely you are to dig up a bomb . 
  random fact : italy is the only country that mints coins for * three * different countries : italy , san marino and vatican city . 
   you know ~ ~ very well . ~ ~ more like people that you know . 
  also , most of the time when you meet people your age in a more casual , non-business setting you will use `` du '' , even though `` sie '' would n't be unheard of if the setting was at least somewhat buisness-like or official . 
  like , you would n't use `` sie '' when meeting someone at a party , at a friend 's house etc. 
  but you 'd definitely use it when e.g. 
  meeting your so 's parents , but definitely not with their siblings . 
  if you are on a sie-basis with someone , even if it 's a business-setting , most of the time you 'll eventually transition to `` du . '', 
  it 's usually expected for the older person to `` offer the du '' ( as we call it ) , but it 's not like we 'll send you to prison if you do it as the younger person . 
  the reason why it will sometimes come across as cringy is because it 's not strictly a matter of respect , but can also be used as a very conscious way of putting distance between you and the person you speak to . 
  so if you use `` sie '' in a situation where `` du '' would work just as well , i immediately get the feeling that we 're having more of a formal , less casual and/or open conversation . 
  kind of like as if you called someone mr xyz instead of his first name . 
  if anything , that would have eventualyl lead to bringing us closer together . 
  even though war is terrible , it also leads to exchange of cultures through conquest etc. 
  apart from that , it 's a very european thing for everyone to have had wars with everyone else at some point . 
  my guess is belgium . 
  if any country has recently made a name for its inefficient government , it 's definitely belgium . 
  do you ? 
  i mostly only think good things about finland , 
  * du the joke still works with `` sie '' , but nobody would ever tell it with sie . 
  i often wonder how the `` du/sie '' thing is taught to german learners in other countries . 
  i understand that people want to be nice , but a lot of times when foreigners use `` sie '' it feels really cringy . 
  i remember my student exchange partner addressing me with `` sie '' , lol . 
  just checked and apparently the queen is officially dei gratia .
