  could reasonably be . 
  i am just not sure with the growing prominence of china . 
  but france is definitely huge on manga and anime . 
  it 's great . 
  would the majority of people who would answer such a question even know what they 're asked ? 
  french is europe 's biggest manga and anime market . 
  but i still think that this map as a whole is ... odd at best . 
  well , and part of it is that our economy is going strong . 
  while we 're on the topic and i see your flair : thanks for your work towards the l\u00e4nderfinanzsausgleich . 
  they have such a bad history with russia that it made the nazis decent occupiers in contrast . 
  thanks to ethnic cleansing they have a big russian minority in their country . 
  the controlled detonation of aerial bombs is [ always interesting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwjmf5wwll0 ) . 
  really puts things into perspective when you think that hundreds and thousands of these things crashed down .

  the [ official theme song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5pdgyozjte ) of the talks . 
  i mean boris johnson tried to push turkey into the eu after brexit just for shits and giggles . 
  noir detective dog is not very pleased about this very specific discrimination . 
  does finland want to hide a murder in their express ? 
  oh , they are . 
  let my sudeten people go , you evil authoritarians !, 
  if you had the chance to hold the hand of such a handsome man , such as the french president , would you let go easily ? 
  well she * is * old money . 
  just to be safe : how is the polish cavalry these days ?

  are you sure they 're from hamburg ? 
  i am sure krawalltouristen from the whole country arrived for this . 
  for historic reasons it 's constitutionally forbidden to use the army for interior matters in germany . 
  well , i can understand that that you want that . 
  but imagine . 
  if you have easy access to guns , they have too . 
  and among hundreds of violent people there are surely quite some who would wield them . 
  not to mention that they would chuck their molotov cocktails and fires on you instead of cars . 
  i do n't think these violent people having guns would help the situation . 
  i really do n't like the idea that these people have easy access to guns . 
  never mind destroying stuff , they could start shooting innocents . 
  the police already has it difficult with molotov cocktails and improvised weapons . 
  but guns in the hands of these violent rioters ? 
  no , no . 
  no , they do n't expect that . 
  most of these fellas are just there to destroy . 
  the real protesters are out there , well , protesting . 
  they are . 
  the police is in the center , protecting the head of states and keeping other protests at bay . 
  these people are not the only ones in hamburg . 
  there are dozens of other protests , most of them peaceful , but they need police overwatch regardless . 
  and some the police combats . 
  there are also zones the police has to keep up and protected , so no protester slips through . 
  uses up a lot of man power . 
  at this very moments the police tries to defend the elbphilarmonie . 
  the politicians moved there for some cultures and the police has it 's hands full [ keeping the protesters off the entry bridges ] ( https://images.scribblelive.com/2017/7/7/3c764afd-adcc-4edb-8055-bedaf2ea64fb.jpg ) . 
  they also have several units in the water because people try to get there via boat or plain swimming . 
  the police does not have a super happy fun time right now . 
  they already called in more police from the whole country . 
  let 's hope that they can fill the gaps and keep the black block at bay . 
  [ protest against ... things ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7srjonstjv0 ) youths under the pretence of politics running a path of destruction through the city . 
  https://twitter.com/polizeihamburg/status/883293176940900353 some armoured vehicles transport materials like barbed wire into the city , but the military says that they wo n't intervene , since the military must not operate internally . 
  i mean , that 's just what she does . 
  i also think that she 's not as much against gay marriage than not caring for it at all as a person . 
  she probably does that to not disturb her relations with her party and even more the moody csu . 
  i think he might be baiting / r/shitamericanssay , but not very elegantly . 
  the guy that gets people . 
  i do n't agree with all his policies . 
  but he has the people in mind . 
  the train stopped when schulz did n't actually delivery much of anything . 
  i really wanted to have our own bernie sanders or jeremy corbyn , but schulz is n't it . 
  ha , fools . 
  battle bears are not the only guard . 
  vlad has some nice surprises waiting in the crulest citadel . 
  with this we can finally start projects for eu-gundams . 
  ah , russians and their fursonas . 
  prime directive meets prime minister, 
  can we release leipzig as a vassal and then have it take the territory ? 
   but such serious talk from mr drummond failed to put off a newspaper journalist dressed as a gorilla , who chased the new mayor as he posed for photographs at the town 's quay . 
   he declined the reporter 's offer of a banana and walked away . 
  seriously . 
  how do the young turks fit in with the late night talk show hosts ? 
  also trevor noah and steven colbert comment on currently ongoing issues in rather small skits , while john oliver creates a more coherent report over the specific main issue of each episode . 
  last week tonight is inherently political , i do n't know why you expect him to ignore currently ongoing and hot issues . 
  i do . 
  his running gags are probably part of why he is even heard in the first place . 
  he can amuse the american viewers at whom this show is primarily targeted and inject information and concepts in to them along the way . 
  for what it wants to archive his format is just right , imo . 
  there are plenty of reasonable people who show information in a serious way - but how many listen to them ? 
  is this the `` technically-not-polygamy '' - type of marriage ? 
  you make us all look bad in worldwide stats about education , welfare and metal bands . 
   `` we wanted people to consider if it is possible to be blessed by a machine , or if a human being is needed , ''  the robot raises its arms , flashes lights , recites a biblical verse and says : `` god bless and protect you . '' if requested , it will provide a printout of its words . 
  machines really come for all our jobs . 
  but i wo n't take it seriously until it has two flamethrowers and a lasgun . 
  you know , if the tories would 've want to win the election they would probably start to campaign properly instead of what ever this would be . 
  though this will probably have influence on the election . 
  i wonder if it 's seen as fault of government under whose watch all this happens or if it 's strengthen the tories in restricting freedom, 
  there was - after what distanced eye witnesses said - a man jumping out of the car and attacking people with a knife . 
  so yeah , accident is unlikely . 
  you did n't just say that , heathen !, 
  i used to live close to the czechian border . 
  i was sometimes taken by my father when he was driving over to buy cigarettes and other stuff at the vietnamese shops there . 
  these bastards sold me fake yugioh !, 
  cards . 
  i also was there once for a minor chess tournament ( i lost every game ) .
