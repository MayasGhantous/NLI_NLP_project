  will cost a lot of money and manpower . 
  better cut the nhs . 
  i never noticed , but we really got [ a lot of photos ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=angela+merkel+beer&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;prmd=inv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewikvrla05juahxeffakhbzidqiq_auicsgb&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560 ) of her drinking beer . 
  prost . 
  would make a good onion article . 
  `` millions of french in existential crisis as they realise that they do n't hate their current president '', 
  yeah , [ she likes it meatier anyways ] ( http://i.imgur.com/niqmazi.jpg ) . 
  that thing is probably off-screen . 
  the chancellor has the eyes of a german eagle . 
   living in berlin ach berlin . 
  i was wondering why the telly was positioned this way . 
  my first thought that merkel sits down with a blanket on her in front of it like a child during feierabend . 
  no doubt , but that does n't change anything about what i said . 
  it is , but that 's the job of the mayor , which she apparently taking on . 
  if any head of state had to respond to all blatant racism in their countries , they would not get anything done . 
  he has to deal with getting his government on track and establishing relationships with other countries . 
  that 's not his level of government . 
  he has a lot of other more important things to deal with right now . 
  he should n't need to chime in on all the little things that happen in the country . 
  no , there is certainly nothing wrong to tailor to a specific group and focus on them . 
  however i am talking about this :  80 % of the venue will be reserved for black women  black people of any gender will be allowed in another area , while a third area will be open to all . 
  they are literally segregating the festival based on gender and skin colour . 
  some minorities can and should be specifically protected and supported if they otherwise would n't experience equality in society . 
  like building ramps for people who depend on wheel chairs . 
  however what this festival is doing is just plain segregation . 
  the end goal is not to help make everyone become equals and enjoying together , it 's to segregate groups of people from each other based on both gender and ethnic background . 
  if we surrender , can we pet the finnhorse ? 
  we build [ our overly big canonns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwerer_gustav ) just because we wanted to , there is nothing wrong down there , okay ? 
  poland can not into cyberspace, 
  we may not have the best kings , but we have the most . 
  thank you , fixed it . 
  strong woman . 
  she has a history of speaking out against oppression . 
  the_d gives her a lot of shit for this and made really awful comments about her in the light of the event . 
  good on her to return to show presence and get money for the family . 
  i do expect the british government to stack the place with security and do n't hold back a penny to make this a success . 
  `` spartans !, 
  it 's only two days until my retirement !, 
  so let 's do our best in this final battle . 
  get the crude drawings of your loved ones out and show them around to remind everyone what we fight for . 
  especially you , who are fresh from spartan school ! '', 
  well , because they met at the royal residence , hosted by the queen . 
  the queen is there as host of the country , amelie derbaudrenghien is there as partner of a nato representative . 
  ** back : ** gauthier destenay ( luxembourg ) , mojca stropnik ( slovenia ) , thora margret baldvinsdottir ( iceland ) ** front : ** brigitte macron ( france ) , emine gulbaran erdogan ( turkey ) , melania trump ( usa ) , queen mathilde ( belgium ) , ingrid schulerud ( nato secretary general ) , desislava radeva ( bulgaria ) , amelie derbaudrenghien ( belgium ), 
  is that the replacement call now that britain is leaving ? 
  god save den mark ? 
  let 's just make it merkel and her harem of handsome dudes . 
  let 's just call the new version of the eu that macron and merkel will cook up eu iv . 
  let the coring begin . 
  `` do you want the war ? '', 
  it 's basically goebbels totaler krieg question , but without the total-aspect since it 's pre-war . 
  why do you think people followed him into war ? 
  `` no , fuck off . 
  why would we want that ? '', 
  is this why its called down under ? 
  looks like we need trigger warnings for hijabs lest we want some people get a keyboard stroke . 
  known for his speciality : the third rice . 
  a meal so powerful you will be stuka with it for a thousand years . 
  that 's true . 
  it was quite hilarious to see / r/france react to the silly badly translated memes and comments by what seems like mostly american trumpists who did n't know much about either the language or the culture . 
   mindful of what happened in the american presidential campaign  showing a level of skill and ingenuity that was missing in hillary clinton 's presidential campaign and at the democratic national committee  this activity is now commonplace , and the general population is so used to the idea of a russian hand behind this , that it backfired on them i tip my hat again for our friends in the united states who took one for the team and showed us what not to do . 
  since both central parties in germany are big and established , they should have the funds to also prepare for this in the upcoming election . 
  i hope they do . 
  2014 they had apparently 42,735 employees in germany . 
  man , i hate lists like this where every rank is one page . 
  edeka ( 317.600 employees in de ) 2 . 
  volkswagen ag ( 237.080 employees in de ) 3 . 
  rewe group ( 225.775 employees in de ) 4 . 
  deutsche bahn ( 186.222 employees in de ) 5 . 
  deutsche post ( 167.082 employees in de ) 6 . 
  daimler ( 166.363 employees in de ) 7 . 
  robert bosch gmbh ( 119.232 employees in de ) 8 . 
  siemens ( 119.000 employees in de ) 9 . 
  deutsche telekom ( 118.840 employees in de ) 10 . 
  metro group ( 108.016 employees in de ) 11 . 
  thyssenkrupp ( 58.477 employees in de ), 
  moses looks like a real estate agent showing interested customers around a really overvalued house . 
  i mean yeah . 
  this is anecdotal , but a lot of people in my environment were n't very interested in politics , but with every shite thing trump did and said it dawned more and more people that sitting on their hands can be very bad indeed . 
  people are currently a lot better informed and eager to vote in this years german election than four or eight years ago . 
  there is this believe that nothing will happen no matter who you vote for . 
  but trump weakened that argument for abstaining tremendously . 
  it 's a reference to warhammer 40k where the inquisition is parted into three ordos . 
  they are very fanatic . 
  the ordo liberalism is the most pragmatic part of the inquisition, 
  damn it , le pen . 
  this is not the kind of high ground i meant . 
  do n't be greedy , a mother can love many children . 
  there were countless wars raging over europe for the past hundred years , many of them on religious grounds . 
  as such religious symbols and places such as churches were often destroyed . 
  since it 's quite difficult to protect every church from warfare , people started to build cloaked churches that were a lot harder to find and thus to destroy . 
  some churches were also connected to the warp way so they could get teleported out of harm . 
  these two innovation protected a lot of churches against the influence of slaneesh . 
  it 's a bubble farting titan . 
  the work assignment for work day is not to work , so no work today . 
  it was . 
  neo-nazism go beyound germany . 
  there are quite some people outside of germany that value the thoughts of the reich or call upon them . 
  starting with countries that were occupied or [ participated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/remembrance_day_of_the_latvian_legionnaires ) and going to countries that did n't have anything to do with it and just have people that believe in the myths of the glory of the reich . 
  no country likes the dark shades of it 's past .
