that means that the government can fuck off and keep there noses out so that 's why they have cameras everywhere ? 
  maybe the jury was smarter than to just vote for the women with the big tits and instead listened to the song, 
  the juries are really diverse . 
  they have 8 people : 4 men and 4 women , 4 are older than 30 and 4 are younger , 4 are music experts and 4 are laypersons . 
  the graham norton show airs ( aired ? ), 
  on comedy central in germany , but it 's rather unknown . 
  it 's like that every year . 
  `` wah , my country or my favorite did n't win !, 
  all others were shit !, 
  the winner is shit !, 
  it 's all politics anyway ! '', 
  lena 's satellite for example is still getting hateful comments on youtube, 
  i think the only time i laughed at the china jokes was when that guy was holding a photo of ban ki moon, 
  i remember about 10 years ago a country sent a [ ( pseudo - ) lesbian girl group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t.a.t.u . ), 
  to the esc that performed again when the esc was held in said country 6 years later . 
  they even made out on stage . 
  if only i could remember which country it was ... 
  hosting the esc is a huge financial burden on the winning country , so they need the `` big five '' ( germany , france , the uk , spain and italy ) to help them financially . 
  in return those 5 countries are allowed to get to the final automatically, 
  they seriously need to get over their victim complex . 
  france , england , poland , russia , thr us , they 're all buddies with germany now , only israel still continues to live in the past , unable and unwilling to move on . 
  `` hey israel , germany here . 
  we do n't think it 's okay that you 're blocking palestine 's trade rout - '' `` holocaust . '', 
  `` oh , okay ... now you 're not letting them leave via land route , that 's pretty hars - '' `` holocaust . '', 
  `` fine ... what ? 
  now you 're building houses on their land , even though you said you would n't !, 
  you 're going too far , israel ! '', 
  `` holocaust . '', 
  `` whatever . 
  i do n't have time for that anyway . 
  i just built myself a new submarine to play wi - '' `` holocaust . '', 
  `` okay , here , you can have it . '', 
  damn greeks , ruining our otherwise perfect score !, 
  it 's simple : there are barely any black people in germany . 
  according to a migration office report there 're about 800,000 people of sub-saharan descent in germany , with a total population of 82,000,000 that 's about 1 % . 
  which also explains why the kid looked at the black guy on the bus , because black people are a rarity . 
   yeaaah not true . . you ca n't take single examples and pronounce a whole country `` not racist '' . 
  on the other hand , the moment some blogpost pops up from a black person claiming that germany is racist because a kid looked at them in the bus , people are all over it . 
  `` i knew it , germany/europe is a racist shithole ! '', 
  is vienna still lacking a hard rock cafe ? 
  ironic , since the original meaning of `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' was exactly that . 
  `` stop thinking about your own little area , stop complaining about the neighboring little country . 
  put the thought of germany ( a united germany ) above all . '', 
  it was written during the early 1800s and after napoleon , when germany was still split up in multiple little countries , and the writer believed that one big united germany was more important than the sovereignty of all those tiny countries . 
  [ here 's an interview with a german lawyer on the matter ( in german ) ] ( http://www.gamestar.de/spiele/hearts-of-iron-4/artikel/verkaufsverbote_in_deutschland,50515,3273534.html ) important things he 's saying : 1 ) foreign video game producers do n't know much about german laws , so they rather cut out more than less ( in the latest wolfenstein games for example they cut out any mention of the word nazi , even though it 's perfectly fine ) . 
  2 ) there was a court decision in 1998 that said that video games are toys , and even though since then the nature of video games has changed and even though other courts have said that video games have art qualities and that the 1998 decision is antiquated , there 's still no leading decision by a higher court or a law by the lawmakers . 
  there could be a change if one of the big publishers was to publish a video game with swastikas in it , forcing a leading decision to be made , but no publisher wants to spend the time and the money on that , as well as suffering the damage to their image that would come with being the publisher who so desperately wanted to use nazi symbols in their game that they went to court with it . 
  these shows started airing in japan in october and are streamed on crunchyroll the same day or the next , so it 's not that surprising that you have n't heard of them . 
  this looks similar to the way napoleon split up germany , as in : foreigner draws random lines through germany , whether it makes sense or not . 
  you mean the one that talked about cologne everyday after it happened , yet for some reason people from the alt right completely missed that ? 
  i think you can see the differences in gender in the anime viewership of different countries here . 
  keijo is a pure fanservice show for guys , filled with tits and ass . 
  yuri on ice on the other hand is basically fanservice as well , but for the female viewers . 
  it has guys in tight clothing who are very close to each other and also appear naked a few times . 
  it 's what anime fans commonly refer to as `` yaoi bait '' or `` fujo bait '' , a show designed for women who like watching guys being gay with each other , but in this they are n't openly gay , they just act in a way that makes you guess ( and women fantasize about ) whether they 're gay or not . 
  when the german movie generation war showed polish partisans being antisemitic , the polish government went ballistic . 
  they claimed that the polish were painted as the biggest antisemites in that movie ( even though you see the wehrmacht butcher jewish families , but apparently that does n't count ) . 
  anything that does n't show the polish people as 100 % innocent victims is not acceptable . 
  collaborators must not be mentioned . 
  all the terrible things that were done to the polish are well known and have been talked about again and again , and nobody is gon na deny what happened ( unless they 're really stupid ) . 
  i think we have reached a point in time where we can see history from a more balanced , less black-and-white point of view . 
  `` warum so kalt hier ? `` , `` eine brust krankenschwester bei mir unter die bettdecke `` and `` warum hat mein bruder mir verl\u00fcgt ? `` is n't exactly the language you 'd expect from a supposed native speaker . 
  thanks . 
  i was just copying the name from the german scrubs fan wiki . 
  sarah chalke actually spoke the best german in that episode . 
  the two supposed germans were horrible . 
  of course it 's him , nobody else would be dumb enough to say shit like this . 
  sometimes they try to fix it by changing the language . 
  for example , in one episode of scrubs there 's a patient from germany , rolf m\u00fcller , and his brother hermann ( hermann the german ) . 
  in the german dub , these two turned into s\u00f6ren olson and his brother erik ( erik the viking ) from denmark . 
  because in australia after a 2 hour drive you 're just halfway to your neighbour 's house . 
  everything that comes to murica is murican !, 
  the statue has 42,73 % french ancestry ( so she likes baguettes and wine , because of the french genes ) , and is also 1/256th cherokee princess . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_motherland_calls  2 ) statue of liberty 93 m ** ( incl . 
  47 m pedestal ) **  3 ) the motherland calls 91 m ** ( excl . 
  pedestal ) ** ca n't have russia come out on top , got ta change the rules midway through the list . 
  actually , if you only count the head of that buddha , the statue of liberty is even bigger than him . 
  usa !, 
  usa !, 
  ever been to / r/worldnews ? 
  according to them , europe is one giant homogenous blob where everybody is white and therefore the same , with low crime rates and public healthcare , unlike the us where all those black people live , so the crime rate is high and public healthcare would never work . 
  but at the same time europe is also overrun by muslims who are turning it into a caliphate . 
  crime is everywhere , all of `` our '' women get raped as soon as the leave the house , and all the immigrants both steal all the jobs while at the same time leeching off the social security system because they 're lazy and do n't want to work . 
  according to these guys , europe is schr\u00f6dinger 's caliphate : both a white utopia and a muslim dystopia , depending on what point they want to make . 
  i hope you help them step up their game , their whole mo is totally unbelievable . 
  like , where would a poor beggar who ca n't speak german find a pc and printer to print out that sign , plus a laminator to make it weather resistant ? 
  and how come this sign is in decent german , while the old woman in front of me ca n't say anything in german past `` gucken hier , kinder krank , geben geld bitte `` ? 
  those jokes about the polish stealing cars have really died down . 
  they were everywhere during the 90s , but i have n't heard any in a long time . 
  [ what about this kaiser ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/cpkhywj3mkk ), 
  for germans romania is the country where all those fake beggars come from , the people who get brought into the city center every morning in a big van , who all carry the same laminated pieces of paper about their three kids and their destroyed house . 
  and at the same time you 're also super homogenous , with everybody being blond and blue-eyed and there 's no crime anywhere . 
  luckily / r/shitamericanssay exists to document stuff like this .
