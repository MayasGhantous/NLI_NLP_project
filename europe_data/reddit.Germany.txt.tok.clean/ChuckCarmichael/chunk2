  whenever people talk about social issues and how the us is lagging behind compared to european countries , americans are always quick to say that it 's actually not fair to compare the us to a single european country because the us so big , so diverse , every county like a different country , every state like a different continent , all those different types of pizza , blablabla , and that it 's actually fairer to compare the us to the whole of europe . 
  so i 'm sure they 'll have no problem with this graphic . 
  they are n't spending tax money on unnecessarily big planes . 
  it 's where i buy drinks , so i call it saufland . 
  well , lidl and aldi both plan to renovate all of their german stores over the next years to make them more supermarket-like , so ours will probably also look like this soon .

  do n't worry mate , we got the back . 
  til [ tuffi ] ( http://www.tuffi.de/ ) is actually named after the wuppertal elephant , and it 's not just a weird coincidence . 
  people over at / r/yogscast were pretty worried that you 'd run over their dwarf symbol after dealing with texas ( they already had an alliance with texas to prevent them from overriding ) . 
  some were planning to tell norway that it 's actually a viking to prevent destruction . 
  i 'll have you know that germany is actually way ahead and produced [ raumpatrouille orion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftdxbidfce8 ) in 1965 , a year before the original star trek aired in the us . 
  i think the correct tag for dead/mutilated people would be nsfl , nsfw is usually nudity .

  b-but muh `` 99 % trump will lose '' poll ... 
  [ there is no bindestrich ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/muster_des_personalausweises_vs.jpg ) , op just ca n't write . 
  germany is also getting hitler and einstein for some reasons . 
  it 's still technically correct , which is the best kind of correct . 
  thanks to the french voting system she does n't stand a chance . 
  she might advance to the second round ( where it 's only her and one other guy ) , but during the second round everybody else will vote against her , causing a complete victory for the other guy . 
  during the 2002 election her father also made it to the second round with 17 % , second to chirac with 20 % , but then during the second round he got 18 % while chirac got 82 % . 
  most of their houses are small row houses that other countries do n't have to that extent . 
  reminds me of my sports teacher . 
  during a class outside he told us he built `` a device '' to prevent his notes from flying away in the wind and that we should do the same . 
  he had put a stick on it . 
  according to wikipedia there are an estimated 180,000 minke whales living in the north atlantic . 
  also using shades of green and red in the same map is awful for people with colourblindness . 
  just so people know : those events were n't cancelled because of any anti-turkish sentiment . 
  they were cancelled because the towns they were in got told that there would be high-ranking turkish government officials at those events only two or three days before the events . 
  they did n't have enough time to prepare proper security measures , especially considering that there would 've probably been a whole bunch of anti-erdogan protesters trying to disturb the meetings . 
  but even though erdogan probably knows that , he still uses it as anti-german propaganda . 
  they just do n't make propaganda movies like they used to . 
  i do n't know much about korean , but that name looks like it 's just nederlands . 
  oranda is probably just holland written in japanese though . 
  the h gets swallowed , l turns into r , and you ca n't end words in japanese with a consonant ( except n ) so there 's an a at the end . 
  it 's simple , really . 
  in japanese they have no l sound and no v sound , so they use what 's closest . 
  their r sounds kinda like a mix between l and r , and the b is really soft . 
  also two consonants in direct succession does n't work in japanese since they only have syllables like ra , to , or bi , so they use tobi instead of tvi . 
  is it still , though ? 
  the problem with satire subreddits is that sooner or later the real deal finds them , does n't understand that they 're satire , thinks he 's found likeminded people and feels right at home , and then satire and actual beliefs become indistinguishable . 
  but there are plenty of places where you can take your boat and where the risk of being abducted and/or beheaded by pirates or terrorists is really low . 
  those are n't the only ones . 
  that was the alexander von humboldt , the ship with the green sails . 
  named after gorch fock , the pseudonym of a german author who died as a sailor during wwi . 
  just wait until they learn that a guy who was recently arrested in germany for planning an islamist terror attack actually used to be a neo nazi and made anti-muslim/anti-refugee videos on youtube . 
  their heads will explode !, 
  even if it 's organic , there 's still a much bigger carbon footprint to meat than to vegetarian food . 
  land cut off by artifical waterways does n't count as an island . 
  the peleponnese in greece for example is still technically a peninsula even though its only connection to the mainland was severed by the corith canal , effectively making it an island . 
  there was a similar news story recently about a german town not accepting applications of bratwurst booth owners for a festival on this year 's earth day , saying that promoting environmental awareness while at the same time selling meat products that are n't eco-friendly ( the greenhouse gases , the garbage , etc. ), 
  is hypocritical . 
  the interesting part about that party is that it 's not bound by the 5 % rule . 
  every other party in germany needs to gain at least 5 % of the votes to get seats in the elected parliament , except this one . 
  look up the legal definition of rape in sweden and compare it to the one in the us and you 'll see where this higher rape stat comes from . 
  basically many things that do n't count as rape in the us do count in sweden ( for example , if a us husband rapes his wife 20 times that 's one rape charge , but if a swedish husband does the same he 'll get charged 20 times and 20 rape charges will appear in the statistic ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moomin_ ( 1990_tv_series )  moomin ( japanese : \u697d\u3057\u3044\u30e0\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u4e00\u5bb6 hepburn : tanoshii m\u016bmin ikka , delightful moomin family ) is a japanese-finnish anime television series, 
  according to the official record chart [ bonez mc & raf camora feat . 
  maxwell - ohne mein team ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82nbscoqoi4 ) is currently the most popular german song in germany . 
  most of the cartoons that were posted here are actually anime , like maja , alfred j. kwak , heidi , moomins , or nils holgerson . 
  there was the death of his entire family in the first episode , the episode where he and the crow almost freeze to death at the bottom of a dark well , the episode where he gets thrown into a dungeon for a crime he did n't commit and nobody believes him , the episode where the travel to duck south africa , the episode where they summon that giant creepy hippo djinn who wants to eat alfred and destroy the world , the hitler story , and several others . 
  shit was dark !, 
   harald siepermann ( probably german ) [ indeed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harald_siepermann ) he went on to work for disney , designing characters for movies like mulan , tarzan , and the emperor 's new groove . 
  he unfortunately died from cancer in 2013 . 
  it 's actually a japanese anime , with only the original idea and the music being dutch . 
  there 's a great reference to it in one of the witcher 3 dlcs . 
  a local furniture shop had this game for children to play while the parents were buying furniture . 
  i never made it past the boat section ( level 2 ) . 
  folded a million times to cut through everything ... 
  after looking at that map , take a guess in which part of germany right-wing populism is the most popular . 
  hint : it rhymes with `` deceased '' . 
  i read an interesting story recently about kaliningrad . 
  the old k\u00f6nigsberg castle was destroyed in the war and its ruins were torn down in the 60s . 
  the soviets then decided to use the area to build a big government building , the house of soviets . 
  unfortunately the castle had lots of tunnels and dungeons and stuff underneath , and it was already built on less than solid ground , so the building started to sink during construction and was ultimately abandoned , leaving behind an ugly unfinished block . 
  people apparently said that the sinking was `` the revenge of the prussians '' . 
  maybe i could get my father 's old car back , it 's probably still around there somewhere . 
  i disagree . 
  i recently had some for the first time after always wanting to try it . 
  at best they taste like herb butter ( since they were swimming in it ) , at worst they taste like slimy dirt , most of the time they taste like slimy herb butter that fell in the dirt . 
  i agree that it 's a stupid system and the people who blocked her are dicks , but i think that if you know that a system like this is in place ( she lived in switzeland for several years ) you should try to not butt heads with the people around you since they 'll be the ones who decide whether or not you can become a citizen . 
  though my guess is that she knew she would be rejected and did it anyway to generate publicity . 
  for italy i would 've gone with `` pizza is actually an american invention '' . 
  did n't they deny citizenship to that vegan lady because she was an activist who was against all sorts of swiss traditions like those big cow bells , church bells in the morning , and traditional horse and pig races , which made the people in her town hate her , and in switzerland the people in your town have a say in whether or not you can become a citizen ? 
  florence was in ac 2 , pienza was in ac brotherhood . 
  and just wait until they figure out they they ca n't claim that the agency that did the poll is a left wing-liberal cuckfest , because the ceo is good buddies with several afd members . 
  i thought that was die welt .
