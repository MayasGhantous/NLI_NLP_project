  how i expect the press conference to turn out : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr62gtekcca, 
  i always preferred republicans over democrats in the us to some extent and i think they had good presidents in the past ( bush sr. , reagan , eisenhower ) . 
  but the current behavior of the leading republican figures is just pitiful . 
  i mean of course you can voice your dissent with the current ruling party , but you still should consider your countries national interest . 
  and constantly interfering with the elected governments foreign policy is a really despicable thing to do , because it undermines your countries credibility . 
  by now he is probably deliberately not showing himself , just to appear on monday and say `` i told you so '', 
  i think we should use the russian tactic of misinformation against them and just keep on perpetuating rumors that putin is dead , no matter the facts . 
  everytime he shows his face somewhere we just claim it 's fake or it 's just a hired lookalike . 
  if only all eu countries would start pulling their weight when it comes to refugees , the situation for syrians would be a lot better, 
   to avoid raising suspicions , they can eat pork , go to discos , drink alcohol and skip prayers while preparing their attacks ` avoid raising suspicion ' , sure ... what a bunch of hypocrites . 
  is there actually any country where the divide between rich and poor people gets smaller ? 
  luxembourg : saw a homeless guy . 
  italy : how aggressive the ` street vendors ' are ( i do n't know how they are called . 
  i 'm talking about the people who sell flowers , bracelets etc. 
  in tourist areas ) . 
  i mean i had heard about them , but damn they are hard to get rid of . 
  was also surprised how much better pizza actually is in italy . 
  czech republic : how modern , safe and clean prague is . 
  i went there when i was 18 and had never been to a former eastern bloc country before . 
  back then i was kinda convinced that they were all depressing clusters of soviet-style apartment blocks . 
  they still have to own the land , do n't they ? 
  i ca n't imagine it 's legal to just occupy some space in a forest . 
  also i think you would need a permit to build larger ` house-like ' structures ( first picture for example ) . 
  i do n't think it is possible to be 100 percent ` off the grid ' . 
  although these findings are worrying , i want to to mention the item in question ( in the survey ) is not about sharia law , but says `` the rules of the bible [ the koran ] are more important to me than the laws of [ survey country ] . '', 
  this does n't necessarily mean that you want to implement sharia law . 
  it mostly means ( in my opinion ) that you stick to the religious rules in case they come in conflict with state laws . 
  this is actually a core principle of christianity as well . 
  the bible calls for all christians to obey secular law , but only if it does n't violate the rules of the bible . 
  on this ground many christians refused military service in germany while we still had conscription . 
  as long as you are ready to accept the consequences , i think every citizen has the right to civil disobedience . 
  i think this might work out this time . 
  russia has not much to gain from another attack . 
  they already have what was most important to them ( donetsk , luhansk and crimea ) and there is little chance of loosing these areas . 
  they can easily sell this as a victory to the russian people at home . 
  if they actually stick to the status quo , the relationship with the west will probably start to normalize in a year or two . 
  the ukraine on the other hand knows very well that these areas are lost and they do not have the means to get them back by force . 
  considering the state of the economy they 'll probably want to use their resources for other things than perpetual war . 
  it 's unjust for the ukrainians , but considering the broader picture , it 's a solution that might work . 
  but according to op 's source that is already included :  household disposable income includes income from economic activity ( wages and salaries ; profits of self-employed business owners ) , property income ( dividends , interests , and rents ) , ** social benefits in cash ** ( retirement pensions , unemployment benefits , family allowances , basic income support , etc. 
  ) , and ** social transfers in kind ** ( goods and services , such as health care , education and housing , received either free of charge or at reduced prices ) . 
  i 'm not saying the us is some dytopian nightmare , where some few super rich people reign over the poor masses . 
  i 'm just saying the oecd report is exaggerating how much wealthier the average guy in the us is compared to the average ( western ) european . 
   in the united states , the average net adjusted disposable income of the top 20 % of the population is an estimated 85 996 usd a year , whereas the bottom 20 % live on an estimated 10 854 usd a year . 
   in germany , the average net adjusted disposable income of the top 20 % of the population is an estimated 57 580 usd a year , whereas the bottom 20 % live on an estimated 13 381 usd a year . 
  the united states have a very unequal distribution of income . 
  their gini coefficient is one of the highest in the developed world . 
  sure they are rich as a nation , but the average american does not benefit much from that . 
  really ? 
  you think the us would order their troops to attack germany if we 'd vote for greece to be kicked out the euro zone ? 
  in fact a lot of us military bases are still here , because we want them to be ( since they generate a lot of revenue for the surrounding areas ) . 
  if we wanted we could tell the us forces to leave ( within 2 years iirc ) . 
  also , if the usa would really want to attack germany with military means , we would be fucked regardless of forces being stationed here already or coming in from abroad . 
  it would obviously be betther than continue to watch them drown in the mediterranean sea and occasionally fish some of them out . 
  but the problem is that a lot of people whose applications get denied , will then go on and still try to make it into the eu illegally . 
  it would probably work rather well for people who can reasonably expect their application to get accepted ( syrians for example ) , but it would be a very different case for immigrants from northern africa for example . 
  also something to consider : to make this system work , you would have to be very strict when it comes to kicking out people who did not apply before entering the eu ( so eventually the word gets around that there is no way around the system ) . 
  i doubt that all eu countries would be willing to enforce this ( sweden for example ) due to public pressure . 
  it 's completely delusional to think that german-american relations will be ` shattered ' . 
  sure the relationship was strained due to the nsa issue , but it 's mainly a problem between governments . 
  usa are our partner , because they are the leading nation in our shared cultural sphere . 
  and while anti-americanism is a position stronly voiced by the far-left and far-right , it 's still just ( a very vocal ) minority . 
  the average german still thinks of the usa in a positive way ; take for example the german emigration pattern : usa is still among the top destinations . 
  usa might not be the perfect nation that many made it out to be during the cold war - but i still favor them as partner over russia or china by far . 
  in what way exactly does the presence of us military bases influence our politics ? 
  the actual number of rapes is probably only a fraction of this . 
  seems the author is just desperately trying to ` uncover a shocking truth ' and thereby create publicity . 
  from everything i 've ever heard from people that lived during the war , pretty much everyone who was able to travel , tried all they could to reach the occupation zone of the western allies and specifically the areas captured by the american army . 
  and bascially everyone described the behaviour of american soldiers in a positive light ( for example handing out chocolate to children ) . 
  i have no doubt that there were american soldiers who raped women , but this will always happen in large scale warfare , simply because people get the opportunity to do so with little chance of getting punished for it . 
  but to compare the american army to the red army in this regard is simply insane . 
  commuting in is often not that easy . 
  surrounding villages with a good connection to public transport are very expensive as well . 
  owning and maintaining a car is expensive and roads are often extremely congested . 
   sorry , i tried to pay money . 
  they did n't want it . 
  that 's the really weird thing to me . 
  there are so many people in germany who are more than willing and able to pay for a legal streaming service . 
  why is the industry so unwilling to meet demand ? 
  as i understand it is mostly a copyright issue , but the copyright owners should have an interest to make it work as well . 
  i guess no matter who wins the election , a lot of people are going to realize how much they miss obama very soon . 
  they only work with atm cards with age verification , so you need a card of someone who is 18 years or older . 
  no , i hope that switzerland and norway will one day also join the european union . 
  i was mostly referring to the political system and especially to the two chambers where one represents citizens and one represents states . 
  i do n't think i have ever heard someone referring to leipzig as a cool city outside of saxony . 
  in saxony though people are totally convinced that leipzig is super hip . 
  i think he comes across as a totally smug and condescending snob . 
  it is still a mystery to me why he is so well liked apparently . 
  i still want a federal european state ( modelled on the us system with strong states ) . 
  but i am afraid that after the financial and migrant crises this dream is dead . 
  makes me sad . 
  circlejerks never lead to anything good . 
  i think it was the right decision . 
  everyone is equal before the law . 
  that means even erdogan has the right to use the proper legal channels . 
  b\u00f6hmermanns `` poem '' undoubtedly produced an initial suspicion . 
  it 's now up to the courts to judge whether or not there was actually a crime , just as it should be . 
  wow , this could be pretty huge . 
  i think the full extent of this leak will only be revealed throughout the coming weeks , maybe months . 
  even if no illegal activities can be proven , it could end a lot of careers .
