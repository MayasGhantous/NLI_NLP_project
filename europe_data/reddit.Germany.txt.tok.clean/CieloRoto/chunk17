  to be honest i think us presidents have less power than most people think since there are a lot of very influential players in the background in washington . 
  obviously a totally necessary project for a city with ** massive ** debt . 
  well , wealth inequality is extremely difficult to measure . 
  if you take a look at the [ wikipedia list of countries by wealth distribution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_distribution_of_wealth ) for example , you see that uk is regarded as less equal than germany . 
  i do n't think it really matters much though , because there is a global trend towards ever increasing income and wealth inequality . 
  there might be a few exceptions , but most countries will only see greater inequality in the coming years , no matter what their situation is right now . 
  do n't forget [ radionics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radionics ) . 
  when i was a kid we had neighbors who were certain that you had to check your house for underground watercourses , because they could make you sick ( because they disrupt the magnetic field of the earth and consequently your own `` energy field '' ) . 
  pretty crazy stuff . 
   germany has a big inequality problem who has n't nowadays ? 
  sure we are not the most equal society on earth , but inequality is certainly not a problem that is unusually dramatic in germany ( [ see here for example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality#gini_coefficient.2c_after_taxes_and_transfers ) ), 
  poland has been the poster child for economical development in eastern europe for quite a while now . 
  romania on the other hand has a lot of potential , but still a somewhat uncertain future . 
  a lot depends on whether or not they will achieve political stability in the long term . 
  if they do , their size and the lack of prospering neighbors would pretty much make the country a growth center automatically . 
  i really would like to see this happen . 
  the shared experience of the election campaign in all eu states could help a lot with strengthening the european identity . 
  it would also be interesting to see which candidates would be selected by the parties . 
   another avenue for recruitment is playstation 4 , whose users can connect in ways that are hard for authorities to detect . 
  really ? 
  so are they randomly messaging kids on psn like `` good game , bro , wan na join isis ? '', 
  only us and uk spend more on foreign aid than germany ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_governments_by_development_aid ) ), 
   tell them not to come that 's not that easy . 
  most refugees get their information primarily from social media , where smugglers spread a lot of misinformation to increase their business . 
  seems rather random to me what is included here . 
  some fairly big ones are missing while some really small , local ones are included . 
   germany has seen 758,000 asylum-seekers arrive between january and october this year , which has caused a political backlash for merkel . 
  so where are all the people now who claimed that we would never have 800,000 refugees this year and the figure was wildly exaggerated ? 
  i would love to see more recent data on this . 
  i have a feeling that drinking culture has lost a good amount of popularity in germany in the last years . 
  i 'm interested in opinions of romanians on what to expect next . 
  will he be replaced by another social democrat ? 
  will his successor ( likely ) be equally corrupt ? 
  or is this a chance for a real change at the top level of romanian politics ? 
  smoking restrictions vary between states ( [ overview ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nichtraucherschutzgesetze_in_deutschland#gastronomie ) ), 
  the treaty to import turkish workers ( anwerbeabkommen ) was signed in 1961 . 
  without football no continental would probably even know this flag . 
  the union jack on the other hand might just be one of the most recognizable flags of the world . 
  i think the same is true for germany . 
  our policy on refugees was for the longest time based on what made us * look * good , not what actually * is * good . 
  i would argue that not even the refugees benefited from our ( at least until recently ) chaotic policy of letting everyone in and pretending we could handle unlimited numbers . 
  and yet people still want to increase the influx . 
  i read a commentary in zeit online just a few days ago , where the author argued that germany had a moral obligation to shelter ** every ** roma in existence . 
  if we would have taken a pragmatic and realistic approach to the crisis from the very beginning ( as in sorting the refugees at the eu external borders ) we could have given decent shelter to a lot more people in actual need . 
  but since everyone was so afraid of looking indecent/racist , we let everyone in unchecked , clogged up the system and now the actual refugees have to live in really bad conditions or ca n't get a place at all anymore . 
  he was very [ emotional ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvatpiilivu ) about infidels though, 
  they are just testing if/how the law is actually going to be enforced . 
  this will inevitably end up in front of a court , because it 's hardly compatible with the law .

  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/t75v7oe ) is an easy way to tell whether you 're dealing with crime or terrorism, 
  there is a difference between the expected number of people coming here and the number of asylum applications . 
  great britain was very wary of german reunification and the alleged political dominance it would bring to berlin . 
  ever since 1990 it seems that the uk is the most critical country of germany 's role in the european union . 
  is it really still a real concern in british politics that berlin could try to take `` control '' of europe ? 
  what could germany do to mitigate such concerns ? 
  judging by how the initial question is worded , i 'd assume the whole point of this thread is for people to compliment each other on how atheist they are . 
  they are and they have been gaining in the last polls ( enough to practically guarantee that they 'll be in the parliament after the next election ) , so i do n't really understand why people claim that there is no party with a stance against the current immigration except the npd . 
  she has to be reelected by the party base ( or more precisely by delegates of the local party branches ) every two years . 
  if she does n't get a majority , she would lose her position as party leader . 
  but i am . 
  tempranillo is available everywhere and has a very good price quality ratio . 
   but the fact you all could be even slightly upset about kicking a genocidal rabid-dog tyrant in the face and would rather just let him be is one reason why we should n't be in the same alliance . 
  the nato is a ** defense ** alliance though . 
  if some middle eastern country actually tries to invade the us , we will be glad to help out . 
  waging war in the middle east - no matter whether or not you think it 's justified - is just not part of the treaty . 
  it even says right in article 1 : * the parties undertake , as set forth in the charter of the united nations , to settle any international dispute in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered , and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations . 
  if you have one of the new german id cards , you have provided a biometric picture to the state anyway . 
  so can we expect czech republic to claim parts of eastern germany and then holding a conference with france , uk and italy about it ? 
  in bonn we have around 320k people and nearly 1.7 billion in debt . 
  including cash loans the figure is well over 2 billion . 
  can someone from vienna say something about the two districts where fp\u00d6 got a majority ( floridsdorf and simmering ) ? 
  is the percentage of foreigners there above or below average ? 
  or is there some other reason for their voting pattern ? 
  i think it 's a reference to the `` atheism plus '' movement ( new atheism ) . 
  whereas old atheism often refers to people just not believing in god , but with no additional agenda or common ideology . 
   so no , the constitution doesnst matter right now . 
  and it can be changed anyway . 
  to change the constitution you would need a 2/3 majority in the bundesrat . 
  which means you would have to get the green party on board . 
  and i really doubt the greens would agree to capping the number of refugees . 
   also , why on earth would you not greet kufars with it ? 
  it 's not a religious greeting . 
  the sunnah reserves the greeting for muslims . 
  the german wikipedia article deals with that in pretty great detail . 
  the meaning of political neutrality is not an objective concept , but defined by people . 
  i do n't think a group that consists exclusively of people with a certain political opinion can ever be neutral . 
  i have to admit though that i do n't know enough about all mods to argue with you if you say you already have right-wing mods on your team . 
  my impression was that it was dominated by social democrats and greens , but that might just be my own unconscious bias . 
  does anyone on this shortlist support a party from the epp , acre , adde or menf ? 
  might be beneficial for some more political balance . 
  so now you ca n't even poison your own water anymore ?!, 
  eu-dictatorship !, 
  apparently my best match is utrecht . 
  maybe i should start planning a weekend vacation to check it out . 
  can you not see the connection here ? 
  the government wants to turn us away from beer so when the forced conversions to islam begin , it will be easier for us . 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  it 's not enough that they get inferior products , they also get our worst supermarkets .
