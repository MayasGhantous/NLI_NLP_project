  but on the ground level i would say there might even be a slight increase again in christians that actively participate in their church . 
   it 's easier for conservative christian ideas to permeate easily within english-speaking countries . 
  these ideas do n't come from conservative christians though , but from far-left liberals . 
  in fact , if conservative christian groups would suggest the same things ( banning books in universities ) there would be a huge public outrage . 
  well , they do n't have a residence permit yet , because apparently the local migration office is still waiting for some documents . 
  so i guess the constant uncertainty and the lingering threat that the asylum request might for some reason yet be denied , is emotionally exhausting for a little girl . 
  according to german media the city of rostock stated that they have no plans to deport her and also informed the family about this in late 2014 . 
  these numbers seem very high . 
  can anyone from france confirm this ? 
   the ercc is actively monitoring the fires throughout europe . 
  it uses national monitoring services and tools such as effis ( the european forest fire information system ) and satellite imagery to provide an overview of the situation in europe . 
  sometimes it still amazes me how much we have already established on a european level . 
  i hope it helps . 
  the squirrel had probably converted to radical islam recently and was now harassing the woman for inappropriate clothing . 
  such is life in north rhine-westphalia . 
  the number of attacks is cleary rising though . 
  it 's actually very comparable to the situation of 1990-1992 . 
  a sharp increase in asylum seekers is accompanied by a sharp rise in violence against refugees . 
  in 1992 it ultimately led to the [ rostock-lichtenhagen riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rostock-lichtenhagen_riots ) , followed by restrictions on our asylum policy . 
  it would be interesting to see the actual market shares . 
  at least in germany we also have a few fairly large german chains ( nordsee , vapiano , maredo , block house ... ) . 
  this is such a non-story . 
  it only exists in the first place , because of a stupid twitter campaign made by people who wan na feel morally superior . 
  merkel is not in charge of decisions about individual cases . 
  what should she have done ? 
  lie on public television and say that everyone can stay ? 
  this was a harsh situation and i honestly hope the girl can stay , but you ca n't govern a country based on emotions . 
   `` sovereign countries ' policies will continue to be dictated by the disciplinarian , quasi-fascist german state - something that has to be opposed at all costs . 
  we have seen the results of unrestricted german hegemony , '' he says . 
  yeah , these kind of people hold demonstrations against everything the government does . 
  radical leftist college students with too much time . 
  i appreciate your willingness to do an ama , but does this really fit into / r/europe ? 
  i mean you 're from from bangladesh , which is not exactly in europe . 
  and as far as i know the type of islam in bangladesh is different in many aspects from the main types in europe . 
  source : [ eurobarometer 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf ) it 's not totally up to date , but i could n't find anything more recent . 
  i still think this might be interesting , especially considering some calls for more integration in response to the current crisis . 
  here is the most recent german opinion poll about the 3rd bailout . 
  the translated questions and answers are as follows : ** question 1 : ** * 3rd bailout : more financial aid for greece is ... * a ) right ( 52 % ) b ) wrong ( 44 % ) ** question 2 : ** * greece : the austerity and reforms measures are ... * a ) suitable ( 57 % ) b ) not enough ( 22 % ) c ) too harsh ( 13 % ) ** question 3 : ** * do you trust the greek government to implement the reforms ? ... 
  * a ) yes ( 18 % ) b ) no ( 78 % ) ** question 4 : ** * should greece remain in the eurozone ? ... 
  * a ) yes ( 62 % ) b ) no ( 32 % ) ** question 5 : ** * are you satisfied with the performance in negotiations of ... * a ) sch\u00e4uble ( 64 % ) b ) merkel ( 62 % ) ** question 6 : ** * due to her membership in the european union germany has ... * a ) advantages ( 37 % ) b ) disadvantages ( 17 % ) c ) equal amount of advantages and disadvantages ( 43 % ), 
  so it 's a robbery gone wrong and not a terrorist attack ? 
  maybe that increases the chance to solve this without loss of life , since robbers probably cling more to their own lifes than terrorists . 
  let 's just hope for the best . 
   2/3rds of germany voted left that 's just wrong . 
  the aggregated vote share of spd , greens and the left party is 42.7 percent . 
  and i 'd say the people that voted for the spd knew what they voted for . 
  after all cdu and spd already formed a coalition between 2005 and 2009 . 
  the government parties got over two thirds of all the votes though , so i 'd say the government is fairly representative of the german people . 
   what 's up united arab emirates that they have 92 % foreign prisoners ? 
  it 's because they massively rely on cheap foreign wokers and use the [ kafala system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kafala_system ) . 
  basically they get cheap workers from developing countries , take their passports , treat them like shit and if said workers try to escape they put them in prison . 
  the eu should send them help via echo . 
  a country that is on the brink of defaulting can not be expected to deal with this all on its own . 
  those headlines , as ridiculous as they are , do n't represent all of germany in my opinion . 
  not everyone who opposes another bailout is a stupid racist who just wants to see people suffer . 
  i think the main reason why a lot of people do n't want to send any more money to greece , is because they do n't trust the greek government to actually implement meaningful reforms , that will ensure stability in the long run . 
  if we had a guarantee that another 40 billion or whatever would actually solve the crisis once and for all , i think a vast majority in germany would n't have a problem to spare that money . 
  in a way b\u00f6hmermann is just as polemic as the bild . 
  sadly at the earliest it will be finished in 2023 . 
  so still a couple of years of flying ahead . 
  if north rhine-westphalia would secede from germany , it would still be the 8th most populous country in the eu . 
  the replacement fertility rate is actually ( slighty below ) 2.1 and not 2.0 , because you have to account for females dying before reproducing . 
  and that is only in highly developed countries of course . 
  in developing countries the replacement fertility rate is even higher . 
   your religion is your religion , it should n't affect how the lives of others are governed . 
  but all european states make decisions that limit personal freedoms ( in varying degrees ) and not only in the name of religion . 
  let 's assume i own a business . 
  in germany i would not be allowed to open my shops on a sunday , because of laws that were made due to christian influence . 
  of course in a way that is illiberal . 
  but then again there are also laws like quotas for woman that were made in the name of feminism . 
  so how is that different ? 
  should n't i have the right to employ whoever i want ? 
  in politics you ca n't always seperate which things are purely personal and what has to be decided for all . 
  think of abortion for example . 
  many people claim every women should be able to abort whenever she likes , because it 's her body . 
  other people think it should be outlawed because it 's murder . 
  ultimately it depends on how you define life and what your personal morals are . 
  but religion shapes personal world views . 
  and since in a democracy everyone has the right to pursue his political interests , i do n't see how religion and politics could be seperated ? 
  that surprised me as well . 
  but i remember when i was learning spanish , one of the first chapters in the textbook was titled '' \u00bf osos en espa\u00f1a ? '', 
  ( `` bears in spain ? 
  '' ) , which was about brown bears living in spain . 
  so i guess they have a lot of untouched nature in ( northern ? ), 
  spain . 
   her problem is that they are n't liberal and waving a rainbow flag . 
  the new ` liberal ' political mainstream is pretty much at odds with every religion . 
  christianity might be less under attack ( for now ) , because it is more established and not as much in the focus of the media . 
  but christianity and islam have in many ways more in common with each other than with modern liberalism . 
  take the issue of abortion for example . 
  most christians will probably be pro-life and oppose any law that allows it . 
  and in every democracy they should have the right to voice this opinion . 
  but [ a lot of people think they should not ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=focd_t9qqpc ) . 
  insightful article , but it would be better if the author would provide some sources . 
   according to a database of british islam , however , only two out of 1,700 mosques in britain follow modernist interpretations of the koran . 
  for example i am wondering what exactly this database is and how it determines `` modernist interpretations '' . 
  even if i had unlimited money and never had to work a day in my life , i could n't visit all the amazing places we have in europe, 
  oops , you 're right , i missed a word there . 
  what 's up with belgium ? 
  do they have some kind of special law that makes it difficult for immigrants to get a job ?
