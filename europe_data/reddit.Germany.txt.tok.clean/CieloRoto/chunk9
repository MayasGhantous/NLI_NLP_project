  many of those soldiers came from places several thousand kilometres away from germany , but their sacrifice made it possible that germany is now a free and democratic state . 
  nice paintings and all , but i ca n't help but think that a wall is n't exactly the type of structure that represents europe very well . 
  thank you , poland , for being our human shield against the rabies invasion . 
  i always support the member parties of the epp , so i 'd vote for bronis\u0142aw komorowski / platforma obywatelska . 
  apart from that , i never heard anything that would indicate that he had done a bad job so far . 
  then again you do n't hear very much about polish internal affairs here ( apart from how well they 're performing economically ) . 
  actually the german election system would cause a huge problem in this situation . 
  snp would have the right to keep all their constituency seats , but they would still have to be proportionally represented in the parliament . 
  that would lead to a huge amount of leveling seats for the other parties . 
  assuming all 56 snp seats are constituency seats , but their overall vote share is only 5 % , the number of seats in the parliament would have to be increased to 1120 . 
  1 snp mp represents 25,972 people . 
  1 ukip mp represents 3,736,717 people . 
  that means an snp voter has roughly 144 times the political influence than a ukip voter . 
  if you take a look at the [ world bank figures ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.sta.mmrt ) , you can see that belarus is supposedly performing better than literally every country in the world at this indicator . 
  my guess would be that they probably just have a different way of counting `` pregnancy-related deaths '' . 
  at least in germany you do n't suddenly gain all your rights at 18 . 
  for example : you can drive a scooter at 16 , a car at 18 and a trike at 21 . 
  you can drink beer and wine at 16 , but liquor at 18 . 
  the age of criminal responsibility is 14 , but you can be tried as a youth until you 're 21 ( depending on how the judge sees your mental maturity ) . 
  i think the last right you gain is your right to become president ( at 40 ) . 
  so it would n't be completely outlandish to raise the voting age to 21 in my opinion . 
  actually i would rather increase the voting age to 21 than lower it to 16 . 
  before ww2 almost every democracy had the voting age at 21 and i do n't think people grow up faster nowadays ( on the contrary ) . 
  of course i would never have accepted that when i was 18 ... 
  i do n't think it 's just a question of knowledge , but rather that you tend to become calmer with age and are able to form opinions more based on reason rather than emotion . 
  personally i rather have a problem with not losing weight . 
  i do quite a bit of running , am rather tall and a male in his 20es , so i need a lot of calories . 
  but i also do n't like to cook and i do n't want 90 % of my calories to be sugar , so it can actually be difficult to eat enough over the day . 
  if we would introduce a fat tax , that would really put a strain on my budget . 
  i would hold out on the panic for now . 
  right-wing violence is n't that uncommon in germany , it 's just less reported on than islamic plots . 
  but the number of right-wing extremists who are prone to violence has only stagnated or slightly decreased in the last years . 
  they are n't a political party . 
  and even if they were , it 's actually very hard and complicated to ban a party , because it 's not enough when they are against democracy , but you would have to prove that they are actively trying to bring down the democratic system . 
  anyways , nazi organisations ( like this one ) can usually be banned more easily . 
  it seems like they were just not very well known before this and probably kinda ` flew under the radar ' . 
  also , judging by their facebook page , it seems like they were trying to avoid legal repercussions by just ` criticizing ' immigrants etc. 
  but not directly calling for violence . 
  if they actually planned attacks on refugees though , it is indeed verly likely that their organisation will be banned soon . 
   i wonder how they call themselves in german . 
  apparently the same . 
  they even have a facebook page ( [ link ] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/oldschool-society/510182879113910 ) ) . 
  seems like right-wing terrorists are also partaking in globalization nowadays . 
   you do realize that a 5 % increase in consumption would generate multi billion euros market in germany 's economy . 
  given germany 's output consumption should be on par with uk . 
  while the uk has a higher household consumption , within the eurozone germany is pretty average . 
  i actually also found a table with newer data ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/graph.do?tab=graph&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00009&amp;language=en&amp;toolbox=sort ) ) . 
   as for labor costs ... that has little to do with disposable income as it is factored with more than just wages ( taxes , training , recruitment etc. . . ) okay , let 's have a look at disposable income then : [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/graph.do?tab=graph&amp;plugin=0&amp;pcode=tec00113&amp;language=en&amp;toolbox=sort ) . 
  seems like germany is doing pretty well here too . 
  german consumption is not especially low compared to other advanced eu countries ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:consumption_expenditure_of_households_%28domestic_concept%29,_2002,_2007_and_2012_yb14.png ) ) labour cost is not especially low in germany ( [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:estimated_hourly_labour_costs,_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_%28eur%29_yb15.png ) ) . 
  well , this is certainly a new level in the whole fifa-qatar ordeal . 
  but if the authorities deleted / destroyed all the evidence they had , i doubt that much will come out of it . 
  i mean everyone already pretty much knows that fifa took bribes , there is just no 100 % undeniable evidence . 
  the italian pavillion looks like someone tried to color it white using the ms paint line tool . 
  so everyone and their mother goes out to advertise for their cause ? 
  i somewhat expected to see a bunch of people demonstrating against paid steam mods as well . 
  not surprising for a country with a steadily increasing gdp . 
  as long as the economy keeps growing , poor people have a reasonable hope to get rich themselves . 
  it 's like the john steinbeck quote : `` socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires . '', 
  air pollution is mostly a problem in big cities and there is not much space to plant forests there . 
  it 's not the problem that the countries do n't have enough trees , it 's a problem with urbanization . 
  if you live in a big city and wake up early before the commute , the air will often be noticeable cleaner . 
  yeah , florida seems to be a popular choice for germans . 
  but personally i doubt that i could endure the heat . 
  i 'm more the northern type and i start to get uncomfortable as soon as the temperature climbs over 25 \u00b0 c / 77 fahrenheit . 
  if i , as a german guy in his 20es , would migrate to the us , which state would be the best choice ? 
  are there states where it would be harder to integrate as a european than others ? 
  although i 've never been to the states , i 've always kinda liked denver - could i fit in there as a german ? 
  `` do you completely agree with all of our politics , which are right and beneficial for the country , or do you want the terrorists to win and your children to be raped ? '', 
  to be honest , if that survey is real , it 's sloppy work . 
  it 's just way too obvious . 
  leading questions should n't be easily recognizable as such ( speaking from a purely technical / non-moral point of view ) . 
  i 'm guessing your sunni ? 
  do you attend a mosque regularly ? 
  if so , my question would be : how is the whole `` islamic state '' thing adressed in `` mainstream '' islam outside of europe ? 
  does the average imam condemn what is fighters do ? 
  or do they avoid the topic ? 
   charlie hebdo might be `` juvenile '' and looking for `` cheap shock '' but does n't mean they are hateful . 
  i get your point , but i see it differently . 
  if you really want to constructively criticize islam , you would write an article or conduct an interview with a muslim scholar . 
  if you just draw bad sketches of naked mohammed , full well knowing how offensive that is to muslims , you are just deliberately trying to rile people up . 
  of course ( and i should n't even have to say that ) that does n't justify violence at all . 
  i 'm not even saying that charlie hebdo should have been banned or anything . 
  it 's just my opinion that it was a bad magazine before the attack and i 'm not willing to put them on a pedestal after it . 
   no expression justifies killing , no matter how vile or hateful . 
  i really do agree 100 % here . 
  but i also do n't believe that being the victim of a despicable terrorist attack makes you posthumously a hero of free speech . 
  i would n't have supported or identified with charlie hebdo before the attack and i still do not after it . 
  i still do condemn every kind of violence though and mourn every life lost this day . 
  there is something similar in the german civil code ( \u00a7 961 - 964 ) . 
  it regulates the question of hive ownership in quite some detail . 
  in germany you can keep the ownership of an escaping bee hive though , if you immediately chase after them ( and you 're also allowed to cross private land while doing so ) . 
   there 's a difference between criticizing ( through satire ) an ideology , islam and criticizing a race . 
  i do n't argue with that , but i think there is also a difference between criticism and mindless provocation . 
  everything i 've seen from charlie hebdo was a ( in my opinion ) a pretty cheap attempt to be as offensive as possible . 
  and i did not compare them to a neo-nazi magazine in terms of ideology , but because many people now claim that it 's not important what the magazine published , but that they should be lauded for their expression of free speech . 
  and i just highly doubt that this would be the case if a neo-nazi magazine would have been the victim of the attack . 
  i never claimed `` je suis charlie '' and i know a lot of people who did not either . 
  unfortunately in the wake of the attack it was n't easy to defend this position as many people had a `` if you 're not with us , you 're with the terrorists '' mentality . 
  i think it 's perfectly legitimate to criticize the award .
