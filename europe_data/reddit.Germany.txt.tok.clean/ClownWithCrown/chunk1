first of all i want to mention that german media didnt point the finger on one of the groups and reported that `` kurds and salafists clashed after demonstrations '' . 
  furthermore it seems that the kurds were the ones who brought the machete , knives etc. 
  now the hard part is how to handle this situation . 
  i can really understand the anger the kurds feel but we have freedom of expression in germany and unless the salafists openly call for violence against other people there is not much we can do about it . 
  for me the situation is really hard to judge . 
  if you support is in iraq/syria we will support those who want to kill you but on the other hand if you support them while you are in germany you are protected by free speech . 
  there are over 400 germans who fight for is and commit crimes in a different country and if germany would take responsibility for their citizens they would send troops to support the locals authorities against them . 
  but no one wants to be responsible for repercussions on german soil so it wont happen . 
   germany is still afraid of its own shadow . 
  we sent enough soldiers to poland already . 
   id say that all arab muslims are foreigners to europe , until the 4th generation . 
  yeah lets not start with that shit again . 
  between cologne and d\u00fcsseldorf . 
  and both trainstations frequently have armed police present . 
  im german and i drive the train every day . 
  you can see them almost always . 
  thats pretty normal in these days . 
  germany , france and england have police with assault rifles on the streets too . 
  usually around airports or trainstations . 
  german police is actually quite okay . 
  but i guess its a nazi joke . 
   ode an die freude was in fact used by the nazis as a national anthem no ? 
  you know i understand why israel feels the need to isolate themself and be strong on their own . 
  but thats not how the modern world works . 
  we all need each other . 
  your children dont want to grow up in permanent fear of war . 
  neither do palestinian children . 
  neither do children anywhere else in the world . 
  and it is our responsibility to achive that . 
  and we wont make it without self reflecting on our mistakes and issues . 
   and even so the bottom line is that a lot of catalans want independence . 
  any region should be allowed at least a vote . 
  no they shouldnt be allowed to vote . 
  then europe will soon look like on my map again . 
  rich regions will split up and poor regions will be left without support . 
  if someone is allowed to vote then the whole of spain should be allowed to vote if they want catalan to split up from spain . 
  thats democracy . 
  you want europe to look like that : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/active_separatist_movements_in_europe.png ? 
   spain is a union of lots of different medieval spanish kingdoms . 
  so is germany . 
  i dont see your problem . 
  1871 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_germany#/media/file:deutsches_reich_1871-1918.png edit : your edit proves my point even more . 
  heres another one : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/hrr_1648.png, 
  [ so is germany . 
  ] ( http://www.ieg-maps.uni-mainz.de/gif/p500d_a3_mb.gif ) sorry but i dont see a reason to have an independent state for every culture . 
  haha, 
  not yet, 
  i wish you the best of luck . 
   anything else would be a unilateral action . 
  and ? 
  how about you stop trying to barge your way out of this and just start somewhere . 
  because before you can cut greece debt they need to change ... really please start to search the fault in yourself . 
  the second we cut the debt now banks will lend greece more money and in a few month they need a new debt cut . 
  it just doesnt work without changing the damn system . 
  but you notice that its pretty much every one against greece ? 
  maybe you should at least question your own belives a little tiny bit if everyone is against you . 
  ( not saying that you are wrong ), 
  `` negativ '' and `` shouldnt '' no one is holding them back from collecting taxes from the rich or fighting corruption or cutting on their defense budget or making the country more interesting for investors . 
  well obviously the time between ww1 and ww2 were not great for germany . 
  but one of the reasons why ww1 happend is that germany rose to country that could compete with great britain and france on economic level . 
  ( reminder : germany was founded 1871 much to the dislike of those two european supwerpowers . ), 
   by 1913 american and german exports dominated the world steel market , as britain slipped to third place . 
  ( wikipedia ) what can greece hope to regain ? 
   i read here that syriza did n't want reforms . 
  have you read the last proposal of syriza to the creditors ? 
  please read it and then judge . 
  you might not know it but greece is an independant state . 
  you can make any reform you want without the approval of the creditors . 
  but how much did syriza do so far ? 
   greece boost their exports just like what was done to germany post ww2 do you want the hard truth ? 
  germany is not greece . 
  germany was a functioning economy before the war and with the help received it became a functioning economy again . 
  greece on the other hand . 
  the fact that we need to compare greece to a country that lost most of its working force and infrastructure in two horrible wars should tell you where you are at . 
   the problem with the nhs and the medicines it provides to hospitals and people with chronic health problems is that the state ca n't pay the medicine firms so the firms do n't provide the medicine . 
  the article you yourself posted here suggests otherwise . 
  thank you for your input . 
  seems the problem is `` parallel trading '' . 
  [ `` gsk experienced stock shortages in certain products , despite delivering several times greek demand , because the products were being exported . 
  '' ] ( http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0cdwqfjad&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.whitecase.com%2ffiles%2fpublication%2ff6ff768c-0cca-4182-991f-10e1f369bd1f%2fpresentation%2fpublicationattachment%2f80d9592b-a347-4979-bf5e-19d6319c523a%2farticle_parallel_trade_in_europe.pdf&amp;ei=gwfzvbeaeinkue-tg-ab&amp;usg=afqjcneklfwv45r8bfepgl04sz2xcbtnfg&amp;bvm=bv.95039771,d.d24 ) [ ` for example , there is a medicine called lamictal for epilepsy which is imported to greece but it is re-exported in such a huge quantity that there is very little left . ', 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/29/pharmaceuticals ) i will read up on the current state of the issue . 
  just answer me one question . 
  how well is greece doing with its current policy ? 
  yes im swimming in greek gold . 
  you 're so pathetic . 
  just accept that greece needs to change . 
  its not going to change one bit from doing nothing . 
  and it wont ... 
  yes downvote me . 
  all aboard the eu hate train . 
  really pathetic to think the eu would let greek suffer from medicine shortage after all we did to rescue it . 
  never heard such a ridiculous nonesense on reddit before . 
  cologne was hit by several `` thousand bomber raids '' . 
  i doubt they cared for single unexploded bombs . 
   but iam also annoyed that some always want `` but that was not true for erveryone '' added to any macroscopic discussion . 
  that is obviously always the case glad you accept that general punishment is always punishing innocent people . 
  btw is guantanamo closed yet ? 
  obama did nothing wrong . 
  only that this video is 2 years old and he still tortures `` some folks '' .
