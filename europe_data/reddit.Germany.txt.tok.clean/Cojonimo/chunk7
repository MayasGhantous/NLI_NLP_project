  4 days !? 
  no , it 's private property and fenced in . 
  why , are you an islamist ? 
  lol , i first thought that was the young putin ... xd, 
  a little known fact is that this place also defines the * mega * . 
  you can see the famous 2 mega mark to the left of the placard . 
  all you have to do is multiply whatever you want to it and you have two mega of it . 
  metric system , best system ... 
  i would believe nothing this `` newspaper '' writes . 
  it 's a total piece of propaganda crap ... 
  `` attack the country '' ... stop being ridiculous ... 
  i was responding to condecending bullshit of some guy in the internet ... 
  thanks for the inquiry . 
  did you feel the need to express your polish inferiority complex when you wrote your comment ? 
  i just doubt that your little theory about `` protestantism is the death of christianity '' bares any substance . 
  you post your little map where green indicates that everything is ok , and pale means `` death of christianity '' . 
  you got ta be kidding me !, 
  just look at the legend , there is hardly any place , protestant or whatever , that has an attendance over 30 % in europe . 
  while the ( mostly protestant ) [ us-states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_attendance#attendance_by_u.s._state ) have * at least * 30 % . 
  so maybe it 's something different ... , 
   the ekd ( evangelical church of germany ) is a federation of many different protestant churches and they are by no means all lutheran . 
  the catholic church is of course fairly monolithic , yes . 
  fair enough . 
  still , ideologically they are basically identical . 
   though american-style evangelical churches have gained ground these last decades . 
  not only in the protestant world . 
  it 's called polemic . 
  you write non-sense like `` from a christian perspective it was a disaster '' , while europe is the most developed region in the world . 
  and the reformation is a very integral part of getting us here . 
  the whole point of the reformation was to follow christian values as the bible tells them , and not what some idiotic cleric claims . 
  so even from a christian perspective it was a phenomenal success . 
  i think you confuse christianity with the catholic church , for them as an institution it was certainly a disaster . 
  there is the catholic church and the lutheran church , the rest is basically irrelevant . 
  so he even took the job of a potential british hero ... something must be done !, 
  lol , is that what you are tought in bulgaria ? 
  [ you are full of shit ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/konfessionslos_zensus_2011.png ), 
  then why do we have only two churches here in germany ? 
  except that the berlin airport shebang is a whole other level of failure and these other states clean up their own mess . 
  like what ? 
  what happened to berlin that did not happen to the rest and justifies it 's current finances ? 
  maybe the arm-aber-sexy lifestyle ? 
   comes with the package of being in a union . 
  what also comes with it is acting responsible . 
  when i look at that whole berlin airport thing ... 
   publix will sell 60 types to satisfy everyone 's needs . 
  yeah , and to * know * your favorite , you need to have tried them all . 
  well , because they are either illegal or they chose to do that . 
  it 's so white , you need sunglases when you go in there . 
  `` things '' ? 
  do you mean women ? 
  and when they said they were not paid you had to to beat some guy up ? 
  nobody in germany has to starve , die of thurst or live under the open sky . 
  so one could argue that your poverty issue is just as irrational as fear of terror , since every other need is `` irrational '' ... 
  what the fuck are they doing ?!, 
  are they trying to make the holy mother vomit on them ? 
  damn !, 
  ps really fucked up ... :d, 
   were part of the ` coalition of the willing ' no , germany was not part of that . 
  germany sent soldiers to afghanistan after nato 's article 5 was invoked . 
  lol , that 's about what they pay in taxes in germany . 
  no , * haus der deutschen kunst * it seems . 
  ( i googled the slogans on the wall ), 
  is stechschritt a thing again ? 
  \\ o / huh !, 
  hold on !, 
  did you just assume his gender !, 
  i thought kid rock would be his successor ... 
   category : comedy xd, 
   one arm of `` multi-legged kraken '' english is a funny language sometimes ... :d, 
  was he part of the mob that clearly attacked the other side , as you can see in the video ? 
  deserves him right ... 
  did n't poles have to learn russian in communist times ? 
  is rutte into s&m ? 
  you mean merkel ? 
  if anyone looks uncomfortable in this picture it is trump , if you ask me . 
  looks like the moment he realized his machismo-shananigans did not work . 
   schulz might have the better ideas and the right mindset has he even told us about them yet ? 
  afaik he mostly sees himself as a train without brakes ... xd * edit : oh , looks like i hurt some people 's feelings . 
   speaks fluently german i just googled her for an interview in german : she speaks it not only fluently but grammatically perfect and almost accent free . 
  i 'm really impressed . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwd20v06axs ), 
  not after we were done with them ... :d, 
  all you are saying is that you gave it slavic names after you occupied our land . 
  we would probably have a border with china if we were not permanently occupied and partitioned by aggressive slavs ... xd, 
  * sigh * we should become holy and roman again . 
  and teutonic ... 
  is n't it pretty much the same border as today between our countries ? 
  lol i was wondering the same . 
  i thought it was just a clich\u00e9 ... :d, 
  there should be a ' [ ... ] ' between the second and third question in your translation . 
  well , then this picture is pretty inapt . 
   pharmaceuticals manufactured in ireland is ireland 's biggest export like ... 
  whiskey ? 
  there is a river with same name . 
  that 's about it . 
  ( i think there are two of that name and the one i mean is even in the czech republic ... o.o ), 
  lol , but they speak the same language ... 
  the mean thing with portugal is that you almost constantly have a breeze of fresh atlantic air there ( at least at the coast where most tourists are ) . 
  it does not feel as hot , and when you are the pale kind of guy , you feel it to late . 
  been there , done that ... :d,
