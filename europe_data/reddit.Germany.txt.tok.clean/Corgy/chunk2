  so ames and hanssen were good , but possibly not the best . 
  well , hyenas do laugh a lot . 
  there was no need to blacken the number plate . 
  the eu is the best thing ever to keep war and misery out of europe since roman times . 
  if my tax money helps with improving life of other eu citizens and spreading the european idea , i 'm fine with it . 
  but it 's fascinating that helsinki-st . petersburg is one of the few transnational connections ( apart from those between benelux and its neighbours ) . 
  i agree to your point regarding the bombings on major cities in the middle of the war - though the flak used a high number of underage personnel they would n't have sent to the front at that time , too . 
  but my main focus is on the pointless destruction of nearly defenceless small civilian cities in the last weeks of the war ( there are too many of them to list them here ) . 
  they did n't make any change to the result of the war and they did n't save any allied soldier 's lives . 
  saying again , i know we had it coming . 
  it just did n't make sense in a military way , apart from being seen as a revenge . 
  whales must like you . 
  wait ... 
   its almost undeniable that the air war against germany was one of , if not the most important contributions of the western allies against germany . 
  that point is highly debated . 
  in fact the destruction of german cities especially in the last months and weeks ( ! ), 
  of the war did n't contribute at all , the moral effect which was the original reason to commit the bombings did n't play out as expected - in the contrary . 
  of course it worsened production and transportation , but these losses were quite efficiently replaced and weapon productions were moved to shelters . 
  i agree that the war needed to be won by the british and i 'm happy that the blitz did n't reach its aims , though i am very sorry for the destructions that happened ( coventry , bristol , london etc. ) . 
  but that does n't justify area bombardements on medieval cities as l\u00fcbeck , w\u00fcrzburg , hildesheim , fulda etc. , selected just because they burned so well , but had no military or industrial importance . 
  thank you for your kind words . 
  as a german who feels very ashamed for the past it really helps to see our pain recognized , as well . 
  i found it very moving to visit warsaw and see how this once beautiful city had been purposefully and systematically destroyed by the germans . 
  on the other hand i found it deeply disturbing that there was a statue erected in london to honour arthur harris as late as 1992 . 
  in my estimation he was a war criminal - the only one i 'm aware of on the british side , but nevertheless ... 
  i hoped that our nations had learned since . 
  at the moment some of my friends do marry and/or have kids ; i do n't really mind . 
  more stability in both job and relationship might change my plans , but i 'm not too sure about that . 
  the modern greek ( and already the byzantine ) pronunciation of that is `` ees tin p\u00f3lin '' , so it makes even more sense . 
   what the heck religious affiliation has to do with racism ? 
  especially since most of us are not religious at all . 
  that 's why there is so much racism in the world !, 
  well , the netherlands were a global power then . 
  as long as they do n't fall for tulips , there 's nothing that could go wrong ... 
  very impressive read , thank you !, 
  most probably can , but should n't here and now . 
  that 's his/her job , also . 
  depends on what you find relevant in life ( which for some might include life itself ) . 
  * as long as i stick to three-word-sentences , there should n't be trouble . 
  * i like it !, 
  the countries propose heritage sites , but the decision is made by the world heritage committee . 
  have my upvote for distinguishing between bild , spiegel , and real journalism ; also for naming one of the most prominent culprits of the hate campaign . 
  probably most you can see pn that picture is sand . 
  some of the stones [ have concrete bases ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stonehenge#archaeological_research_and_restoration ) , though - and the renovation works connected to that lead to [ this beautiful conspiracy theory ] ( https://weoccupyearth.wordpress.com/2014/04/15/stonehenge-under-construction-1954-very-real/ ) ... 
  do n't call the concentration camps polish . 
   they 've also requested/suggested that the turkish ambassador be summoned to further explain the situation , which is certainly not the lightest of tools in diplomatic circles . 
  ... though quite a battered one in case of the poor german ambassador in turkey . 
  isolated expat communities tend to be that way - let 's rather not talk about german groups in south america in mid-20th century , keeping up what * they * held dear ... 
  the fact that many turkish immigrants of the 50ies came from rural eastern turkey does n't help much , either . 
  * bremerhaven , the worst kind of bremen . 
  yes - but mentality and local names might not change that fast - confer ` mitteldeutschland ' , e.g. 
  [ op ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4fge38/a_regular_students_day_in_germany_going_shopping/d28o6xf ) made it look so deliberately :  i should mention that i for posting it on r/notinteresting , i took extra effort to make the pictures drab and boring . 
  i often waited a while for people and cars to pass by . 
  before ww2 , poland had much more territory in the east , so it was . 
  he 's had about 1,800 cases of ` insult ' opened . 
  i doubt that it 's always a new idea ... 
   science of the swedes : sea related more like * `` in the liberal arts '' * ( `` in freuen [ -  freyen ] k\u00fcnsten '' ), 
  japan ? 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland_is_not_yet_lost ) gives it as such :  poland has not yet perished , so long as we still live . 
  what the alien force has taken from us , we shall retrieve with a sabre . 
  march , march , d\u0105browski , from the italian land to poland . 
  under your command we shall rejoin the nation . 
   we 'll cross the vistula and the warta , we shall be polish . 
  bonaparte has given us the example of how we should prevail . 
  march , march ...  like czarniecki to pozna\u0144 after the swedish occupation , to save our homeland , we shall return across the sea . 
  march , march ...  a father , in tears , says to his basia listen , our boys are said to be beating the tarabans .

  its range is much too large to be sung by a crowd , though ( and there have been some poor choices of professional singers recently , too ;-) ) . 
  i really like het wilhelmus , it has a nice melody !, 
  thanks for mentioning those chanting `` wir sind das reich '' !, 
  i had n't recognized that before , though i wondered why `` volk '' sounded slightly muddled . 
  they are showing their true colours now . 
  that 's hilarious !, 
  it happened in a red lights district , so probably they had a ~ ~ massage ~ ~ message in mind . 
  we 've got a common currency , we 've got open borders ( just suspended them due to the current crisis , but everybody wants to return to it asap ) , there are lots of joint institutions and activities , from parliament to courts to education standards to shared ownership of a navy ship ( nl/ger ) , and generally growing cooperation on many levels . 
  the wars that hammered us together happened a century ago , but nevertheless they shaped our collective values and ideologies . 
  in our case , it 's the common conviction that such a thing must never happen again . 
  by the way , even though the european countries are smaller than some us states , many of them include variance in itself that is about as large as that between california and new england - or even more distinct . 
  there are countries with several official languages , autonomous regions with separatist movements , or highly independent federal states - as in belgium , spain , uk and france . 
  local dialects may be hardly mutually understandable , as is the case with some southern and northern german dialects ; also the cultural traditions , mindset and social organisation may be much more orientated towards their respective neighbouring country than towards their fellow countrymen . 
  in many of these cases , a larger european structure may be the way to interconnect what has for a very long time been reaching out to each other , and to tie together all these odd parts in one large bag . 
  surely you mean [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/albrecht_altdorfer_044.jpg/407px-albrecht_altdorfer_044.jpg ) . 
  the formerly independent st. j\u00fcrgen is a district of schleswig today . 
  just 3 km south of friedrichstadt is the village of st. annen . 
  oh , thanks , i did n't know that ( and german wikipedia is unclear on it ) . 
  so , in their perspective , auschwitz was german , indeed . 
  but i doubt that pis would like to use this as an argument . 
   what courage during this time have shown their leaders [ ... ] successfully solve industrial and social challenges uh , yes , i could n't imagine . 
  thanks !, 
  ~ ~ no , it was n't ~ ~ - o\u015bwi\u0119cim belonged to austria ( - hungary ) between 1772 and 1918 , and after that to poland , again . 
  `` herzog von ^ ( = duke of ) auschwitz '' was an official title of the austrian emperors . 
  * edit : i was wrong - it was annexed during ww2 . 
  there are actually people who are * proud * of that ? 
  obviously the [ student protests of 1968 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_of_1968#protests ) in different countries had very different aims and results . 
  while they indeed had mainly socialist/marxist tendencies in france , they were pacifist and anti-racist in the us ; anti-vietnam in us , gb , italy etc. 
  ; anti-establishmentarian and antifascist in western germany ; anti-communist in czechoslovakia ; against dictatorship in brazil and in spain ; against the apartheid in south africa , etc. . . 
  so in many cases it was protest against a ruling class and established structures of power . 
  though many of its participants may have been misled to some degree with regards to their political views , the grievances they protested against were real , and some of the freedom we have nowadays is due to them . 
  it did n't end up in ` communism ' - socialist tendencies ( and even extreme left terrorism ) was just one of its byproducts , but it also was a desperately needed social reboot . 
  though i 'm fairly conservative i must admit that the '68 movement was absolutely essential in dealing with the past , e.g.
