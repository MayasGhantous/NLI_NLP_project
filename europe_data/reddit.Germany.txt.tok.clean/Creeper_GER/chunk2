  yeah . 
  i agree . 
  i cant change that though . 
  bottom line is : we all are getting fucked by the same people , yet we hate ( or dislike ) each other . 
  this sucks . 
  everyone looks at germany and sees how our country fucks yours . 
  no one sees me , sitting within the belly of this beast , getting paid shit , worrying if i should have a kid with my girl because im not sure if i can afford it . 
  we really should unite . 
  not for the mighty , but for ourselves . 
   germany is profiting a lot this way , through a always more vital industry and does n't want to change policy . 
  this system is also great if you 're not working and having your revenue with capital ( how much retiree with high share of retirement through capitalisation are voting cdu ? ), 
  probably a whole lot . 
  but im not . 
  and `` germany '' may benefit from that . 
  yeah . 
  no doubt . 
  but i dont . 
  after all , i think i made my point . 
  i am against the eu , and if i will ever get the chance to vote on the matter - i will . 
  and i will drag every single one of my friends to the booth with me . 
  now lets hope democracy will work long enough to give me this choice eventually . 
   so if the remain camp has used more/better propaganda to get a safer result is that not okay ? 
  its not . 
  okay would it if they listed the facts , let the public decide and win by that ( for both of your examples ) . 
  that would be okay . 
  manipulating masses so they follow your course is not okay . 
  doesnt matter ( to me ) which side does it . 
  please be aware that the word propaganda has a meaning , which seems to be watered down more and more . 
  pay special attention to the `` especially of a biased or misleading nature '' part of the definition . 
  https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/propaganda i dont know about you guys , but i hate being misled and lied to . 
  maybe some of you like that , but dont assume everyone does . 
  im having trouble translating what you wrote . 
  english isnt my first language . 
  im trying though . 
   first because if you 're a total jerk and want to continue to steal er jebz you need the current system . 
  are you saying that im stealing your jobs ? 
  because ... you know im not `` germany '' , im just a dude who tries to make a living here . 
  i never stole anyones job . 
  i didnt sign any trade deals with other nations either . 
  so ... i dont really know . 
  i bet i understood you wrong here . 
   second if you 're not because make you to be paid more is one of the main aspect of what could be done about this issue uhm . 
  yeah . 
  dont really know what youre saying here , im sorry . 
  are you saying the eu wants me to get paid more ? 
  if so , why dont they tell me ? 
  what are they doing to ensure a wage rising greater or equal to inflation ? 
  please tell me . 
  we dont have a monthly minimum wage , we have a hourly minimum wage . 
  the figures hold true for people with a 40 hour week , but are horrifically wrong for anyone else . 
   propaganda is n't inherently bad . 
  what ? 
  let me guess : it just depends on ** whos ** propaganda it is , right ? 
   the european union should launch its own broadcasting channel to counter the lies which lies ? 
  yours or the ones of the other side ? 
   that 's how democracy works !, 
  oh , one more thing . 
  democracy works like that : vote for a !, 
  contra-argument , so forth . 
  vote for b !, 
  contra-argument , so forth . 
  democracy does not work like that : vote for a !, 
  vote for b !, 
  contra-argument , contra-argument , contra-argument . 
  this isnt fair . 
  but apparently , im just `` another victim of populism '' ( if you ask the person who wrote the other comment ) if im against the eu . 
  i do not have a valid argument . 
  because im against it . 
  fuck that . 
  the guys `` arguing '' like that will see what they get for that . 
  the u.s.a. sure feels what they got from it now . 
  [ edit ] sorry for the lack of formatting . 
  i dont understand how reddit uses line breaks and such . 
  yeah . 
  im just stupid . 
  can do . 
  one of my main concerns comes from donald tusk , saying stuff like `` only together can we be fully independent . '' ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/press-releases-pdf/2017/1/47244654122_en.pdf ) . 
  this does remind me an awful lot of `` war is peace , freedom is slavery , ignorance is strength '' in the sense that it takes words ( in this case `` together '' and `` independent '' ) and absolutely strips them of any meaning they might have had once . 
  you can not be `` independent together '' . 
  you either cooperate , in which case you work together , or you dont , in which case you act independent . 
  screwing with the very language you use is a very concerning sign of things to come , especially when youre the president of the european counsel . 
  i would prefer if the taxes i pay get used to build new schools and/or infrastructure in the country i pay the taxes in , instead of using it to help the financial needs of a country i 've never even been to in my whole life . 
  this is especially true if everyone knows that those countries are doomed financially anyway , and all our payments do is delay the inevitable . 
  since im just a `` normal worker '' i will never benefit from open borders because i cant afford any vacation outside germany anyways . 
  i do , however , acknowledge that the freedom to travel wherever you want , whenever you want must be a very good thing for people who do that . 
  i dont . 
  and since you asked me for my reasoning , i will give you exactly that . 
  now . 
  im running out of time here , so let me `` answer '' the points in the document linked by you : ** europe must not fail ** why ? 
  they tell me that europes survival is at stake . 
  so what ? 
  how do i benefit from the survival of europe ? 
  tell me 3 benefits of living in the eu that i wouldnt have if germany would be on its own again . 
  ** the threat to peace ** doesnt come from european countries , last time i checked . 
  ** we are responsible ** yes . 
  i am responsible for my future . 
  my future , not yours , my dear politicians . 
  and im not voting for those `` anti eu forces '' , but i understand everyone who might . 
  and i dont blame them . 
  we managed just fine before the eu , and i think we will manage just fine after it went away .
