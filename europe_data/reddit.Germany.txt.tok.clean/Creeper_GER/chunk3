  but , im aware that this will never happen . 
  ** get up and vote ** why ? 
  i wont benefit from it . 
  if i vote for my local leader , i at least can expcect him to tackle some local problems which actually affect me . 
  i dont have problems spanning all europe . 
  other people have . 
  i dont care about other people that much , if you can excuse that . 
  ** basic rights and rule of law are inviolable ** yes . 
  they are and they will be . 
  eu or not . 
  stop acting like we went from medieval times straight into the european union ffs . 
  ** european fundamental freedoms are not negotiable ** free movement of persons , goods , money-transfers and services will stay free even without the eu , if the trade partners agree to it . 
  i dont see the point here . 
  maybe you can enlighten me . 
  ** reforms are necessary ** i wont comment on this point . 
  apparently im too stupid to understand the eu and this is the sole reason im against it . 
  uh-huh . 
  if you say so , mr. 
  politician . 
  ** take mistrust seriously ** yeah ? 
  and do you do that ? 
  or do you just make a 10 point list to show the people where they are wrong instead of listening to them ? 
  please , please do change my mistrust into confidence . 
  i beg you !, 
  unfortunately , papers like that wont help with that . 
  ** diversity and joint qualities ** i dont see how an end of the eu would impact the diversity of the people living in the states . 
  maybe you can clarify that , too . 
  ** we all can , and should be a part of it ** i dont care about the european pulse whatsoever . 
  it living is the same as it dying for me . 
  so i dont know what the fuzz is about . 
  overall , i just can not be brought to care about millions of people . 
  i have a family . 
  these are the people i care about . 
  not you , not my neighbor , and even less some dudes in greece , france or fuck knows where . 
  and all i can tell you is that the amount of work i have to do doesnt change , and neither does my wage . 
  what does change constantly is the price of food , water and electricity . 
  change that , eu , and maybe i will lend you my ear again . 
  btw op : this isnt against you , but against the people who wrote the paper which tells me in 10 precise steps what to think . 
  i have no negative feelings against you . 
  just to clarify . 
  yasss , yasss ... tell me what to think , how to think and when to think . 
  who the fuck do you shitlords think you are ? 
  im not demonstrating for your shitty idea of new-usa which only gets me one thing : more problems and less money . 
  get your ass up and on the streets yourself , if you so desire . 
  i will vote to leave as soon as i get the chance ( while knowing ill never be given that choice ) . 
  regards - a german citizen, 
  most stupid sentence i 've heard up to date . 
  makes no sense , is evidently wrong and defies all logic . 
  congratulation . 
  double think is a hard skill to master , but he sure is on the right way . 
  wow . 
  a civilzed , well articulated , factual response . 
  im baffled . 
  first : thank you for that . 
  second : i dont believe im wrong here . 
  you , on the other hand , are maybe `` more right '' then i was . 
   of course it 's meant to provoke overreaction and fear , do you really want to argue that ? 
  i dont . 
  what i want to emphasize is that thats not their main goal . 
   of course you do n't `` win '' when people are murdering other people but you do `` lose '' when you start going crazy / becoming afraid . 
  so you lose when and if you start to protect your family , which comes naturally if youre afraid ? 
  im not so sure if i can agree on that . 
   there is a theoretical framework to modern terrorism [ ... ] now that you told me what you think they want , can you tell me why they would want all that ? 
  how do they benefit from that ? 
  ( i dont disagree , i just think we will come to a different conclusion )  it 's not new ; do you really think the people that specialize in terrorism never cared for the historical and theoretical frameworks of terrorism ? 
  first : unfortunately i dont have the time right now to read this paper . 
  second : no , of course i dont think that . 
  i just think someone who kills in the name of some god shouldnt be treated like a rational , sane being . 
  i think theres more , or should i say less , to it . 
  to put it in batmans terms : some people just want to see the world burn . 
  since id been living in poland , i would be cool with that . 
  but ... the question remains : who would pay europes bills if were gone ? 
  i can tell you what they want since nobody seems to motherfucking understand that simple little detail . 
  they . 
  want . 
  kill . 
  people . 
  you can not `` win '' the fight with terrorism . 
  stop acting like you going about your business is somehow a slap in a terrorists face . 
  its not . 
  not at all . 
  they dont care whether you sit at home in fear or not . 
  they dont care about anything except killing western people . 
  what is so fucking hard to understand about that ? 
  what ? 
  no , of course im ... wait ... fuck it . 
  thats it . 
  im done with my comments . 
  have fun with your idiotic assumptions . 
  let me guess : they would piss on my white flag before using it to wipe off my blood from their hands ? 
  sometimes i wonder why i even bother to comment anymore . 
  in war , you can surrender when you cant go on any further . 
  terrorism will piss on your metaphorical white flag and will use it to wipe your blood from its hands . 
  i dont care about your ` murica rambling . 
  i didnt say you guys are to blame , did i ? 
  i just stated a fact . 
  there is nothing to argue here . 
  you didnt flee from terrorism , dear refugee , you fled from war . 
  this distinction is very important . 
  today , a sack of rice fell over in china .
