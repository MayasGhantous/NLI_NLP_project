  we get way more out of selling these tanks than money . 
  also , it is not like we could have made more use of them here in germany . 
  the german industry was opposed to sanctions on russia but that didnt matter either in the end .

  you have to be incredibly imbecile to be in favour of leaving in germany .

  great argument . 
  `` if they dont care , why should we ? '', 
  if we woud follow this line of thought no one would ever receive any form of help . 
  german president said that .

  and you consider that unethical ??? 
  the `` european community '' is at fault when companies decide on their own to leave the uk because the people in britain decided to leave the eu ? 
  i do not understand your line of thought . 
   european community hanging around the uk like vultures what reality are u living in ? 
  you get triggered by an obvious troll comment ?

  no he said these two would be in the government . 
  he didnt say a thing about its structure . 
  i do n't see how this has any revelance .

   lamborghini has a history of partnering with the italian police . 
  in 2008 , the carmaker donated a pair of gallardos , but just a year later one of the cars was destroyed when it collided with a careless driver . 
  the company donated its first huracan to italian police in 2015 . 
   new lamborghini will mainly be used for transporting organs and blood to save lives . 
  pr which ill people benefit from , seems cool to me .

  the head of the party in thuringia made a controversial speech that was recorded . 
  it was so controversial that a party expulsion process was started with the current head of the afd supporting it . 
  this lead to a split in the party with people attacking each other . 
  thanks , 
  alright this is enough . 
  ur ass is goin to jail if sth goes wrong . 
  why would a russian citizen view the nato as a protection ??? 
  from what ?? 
   this is just typical stupidity you 'd see from the americans . 
  do n't know why you need to generalise here . 
  energy prices are high enough already in germany .
