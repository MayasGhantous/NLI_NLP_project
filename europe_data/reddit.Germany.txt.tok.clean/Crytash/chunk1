it is the kiautschou dialect . 
  if you destroyed your so ` s car and the court can most likely not prove it , but you buy your so a new car + make a deal with the court , yes the charges will get dropped . 
  you can do this as a commoner as well . 
  actually it is realy often used for `` commoners '' . 
  it was on ice and is now fully canceled . 
  if i am honest , i dont see the big news but w/e . 
  i agree with you . 
  in the end jaywalking ( especially in front of the kids ) is just unnecessary and sets a bad example . 
  it is not hard to follow simple rules . 
  it is transtported to the kit ( my university ) . 
  some of the streets in karlsruhe are quite narro . 
  it is a fairly old town and was build in the 18 century . 
  apart from the main streets it can be rather difficult for a transport as big as this to advance within the city . 
  this is the article to the picture i guess : http://www.spektrum.de/news/katrin-die-feinwaage-fuer-neutrinos/1190760, 
  they also did plenty of good . 
  especially if we talk about the witchhunts and the role of the church people still seem to think that was way back , while actually it was in modern times and so forth . 
  noone says , you dont have to be uncritical of the church , i would argue it is necessary , but you have to try to be as neutral as possible and do n't get sucked into the views of the 18/19 century . 
  especially the middle ages have some big mistakes and `` the dark age '' are still tought in germany . 
  same goes for a certain hostility against regligion and many teacher still feel that the [ conflict thesis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conflict_thesis ) is not that wrong . 
  over all you see many problems that you have here in reddit as well . 
  i would n't say that . 
  it literally means a location where no human being ( hence the fox and the rabbit are there - they are very afraid of humans and so they try to be as far away as possible from them ) . 
  as for that it would be a more fantasy style , it depends . 
  in the south i know many people who use it as a synonym for `` am arsch der welt '' , just pg . 
  i dont know how other parts of germany use it .

  wo fuchs und hase sich gute nacht sagen - a place where a rabbit and a fox would say good night to each other, 
  well , because this is actually communism/stalinism . 
  stalin - and it is his view that is dominant if you look how the russian society is still fairly traditional and paternalistic . 
  stalin was very much for women in the workforce , better education etc. 
  but he did not realy approve marxistic feminism afaik - and that is why i would mix those two too much . 
  you can be for women in work and still use very traditional gender roles as shown in todays russia . 
  edit : if you want to read something about this topic , i would say `` daughters of revolution : a history of women in the u.s.s.r '' from barbara evans clements would be something for you . 
  i agree . 
  while we are at it , does this mean that egalitarianism worked better than feminism ? 
  i know this is a somewhat controversial discussion , but with those numbers you would have to ask that from a scientific point of view . 
  also as far as i know the northern eu countries have very flexible work cultures , very interesting points could be made with this paper as a reference . 
  i did never say that it would be solely because of that . 
  what i wrote was - and i quote myself -  cultural drawbacks ** like ** the higher rate in alcoholism or the russian way of `` manliness '' ** might have a way higher influence on this subject than what you seem to give it credit for **  ( ... ) so what i said is , that there are other reasons like alcohol that you are n't even mentioning . 
  if this was n't clear enough i apologize , but i thought it is realy hard to misunderstand what i wrote . 
  rather than a sole reason for this , i tried to add other - albeit very negativ ones - additional reasons . 
  it could be true ofc . 
  i just pointed out that it describes the situation in the last 10 years or so . 
  what will happen in the future/this generation does not have a direct efect on the topic at hand which is about women in senior management situations . 
  i hope i am not to blunt ( as a german :d ) , but how do you define as alcohol and what as an `` hard drinker '' . 
  the problems described in the paper are from episodical drinking , not constant every day one . 
  because georgia does n't have a alcohol , but have had a huge drug probem ... edit : also the problem for russia and many former cccp states are the huge ( bigger than in western states afaik ) gap between male and female deaths to alcohol . 
  the study was published this year . 
  i am pretty sure the data is still accurate . 
  i would disagree a bit . 
  cultural drawbacks like the higher rate in alcoholism or the russian way of `` manliness '' might have a way higher influencs on this subject than what you seem to give it credit for . 
  25 % of every russian man dies at age 55 - for comparison only 14 % in gb . 
  the average lifespan for a male is 64 ; the retirement age for germany . 
  and we are talking here about excessive alcoholism , that causes these deaths due to accidents and health issues . 
  in other words , those people drink themself to death . 
  now you can not do that by just drinking every once in a while , that is why russian males also have way more absent days and days where they come in not 100 % ready for work to put it mildly . 
  there is a great research article .

  while that is true , the fertility rate in the east is higher , while the age demo shows that there are less young people in the east . 
  so the rate is not able to compensate it , but it is worth noting imo . 
  according to that study britain could not overtake germany , if it leaves the euro too . 
  just saying . 
  that study also suggests , that gbs gdp will grow from more than # 1.59 trillion in 2013 to # 2.6 trillion in 2028 - which is realy optimistic , not even considering scottland could very well be independant by then . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27xrm8/media_coverage_in_germany_and_the_uk_shows_why/ you might want to read this article . 
  this is correct , bur some of the things they stated were pretty far right ( at least from a german perspectiv ) . 
  depends what you define as moderate . 
  they are between the npd ( extremright/right a investiagtion if they are conform with the constitution is on its way ) and the cdu/csu ( right/middle ) . 
  by nature there are some very very right person in that party , but also many globalisation critics . 
  over all i would argue , that they are a far right party with a moderate sprinkles . 
  right wing populists do n't ahve it easy in germany and that they are anti globalisation helps them quite a bit . 
  i doubt that it is realy debatable . 
  if we look at most scandals , or any major investigative journalism in recent years in germany you do n't realy think the spiegel is the medium chosen by sources to make them public ? 
  - every time it is der spiegel , who publishes it/investigates it for the german meda sphere , so i would doubt you find other major investigative journalism in the german language area , who could be in any way shape or form called balanced investigative journalism . 
  if you do n't like what they write it is your thing , but the facts might differ . 
  we do n't need to bash a magazine , that is one of the better ones all over the world . 
  [ here is it . 
  the `` elephant table '' , where every major party discussed the outcomes of the election in 2005 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdkuqnvujgs ), 
  first of all it is `` spiegel online '' , not spiegel itself . 
  secondly i am sure you are aware , that spiegel is quality journalism . 
  no need to bash things here . 
  in germany it could/would be `` kegel '' . 
  it originated from the word `` kebse '' , a old word for mistress and is used as `` child ( son ) of a mistress '' . 
  well it is not like russia never invaded anything ... 
  schr\u00f6der already lost most of his power base in the party while he was chancellor and got already crucified for the welfare reform . 
  he is the reason that there is shism in between the linke and the spd :d that is true , die linke has the better position in terms of ideology , but as soon as they play their cards the spd and greens wont make a coalition with them ( as they did last time ) . 
  atm they are the ultimate oposition party ( on federal lvl ofc ) , but they need either the spd to change or they have to change themself , else they will never be realy relevant in terms of governing . 
  look at it as a leftist tea party without the social implications and being a actual party . 
  they have to attack the more centrist party ( establishment ) , but that only leads to more problems ( a strong cdu/csu ) . 
  `` is '' , he is pro russian . 
  in his ( and other former spd legends ) view of things the eu/usa are the reason ua is not stable and therefore we should not even have sanctions . 
  however , schr\u00f6der has almost zero standing in the spd nowadays ( he ochastrated the big social welfare reform ) and the spd is a government party , they have to speak with one voice with the cdu/csu on this matter ( and need this stance to have an edge on `` die linke '' ) . 
  they are between a rock and a hard place , even if they wanted to liek russia , they would be viewed as turncoats , becouse they refused to make a coalition with die linke and greens - a campaign pledge and tactical maneuver , else they would give conservativ politician even more fighting power and maybe lose some centrist voters ( while ofc getting the conservativ base very activ ) . 
  people forget that , but older man `` learned '' in the army to be against the cccp . 
  even my old father still has the concern , that `` the russian '' could try to get back to former `` glory '' . 
  while this can be ridiculed , the fear exists , but who am i talking to :d, 
  many strong left parties have quite the soft spot for russia :d and they would argue it is the future not the past , but in the end it does not realy matter . 
  as long as every other major partie disagrees , they wo n't do anything meaningful . 
  this goes much further than just votes from their conservativ base . 
  it is basically their triumph over the green party on int .
