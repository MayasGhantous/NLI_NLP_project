  however , i understand that even many germans were raised to believe differently , so it really is a mess all over . 
  not very highly . 
  we like order and peace , and anarchism has major fundamental problems with the ideology . 
  if lack of government worked well , america would n't be in such a shitty state and north somalia would be the leader of the free world , and yet neither is true . 
  i do n't think it should be prohibited . 
  it would open the door to limiting freedom of ideas , it causes no harm to anyone , and there is absolutely no reason why the government should be looking at people 's porn - that 's an invasion of their privacy . 
  furthermore , it provides a safe outlet for pedophiles to release their urges in a way that does n't hurt anyone . 
  in contrast , what do we gain by banning it ? 
  hahahaha yeah , alright . 
  you can immigrate to ukraine or georgia if you want , but those are war torn countries that are * hotbeds * of terrorism . 
  the idea of ukraine 's newspapers all devoting front page sections and days of debate because some wacko ran a over others in a car is laughable in the extreme . 
  you clearly have lived an insulated life if you think eastern europe has better standards of living than western , and by all means , if you no longer want to be insulated , you can most certainly move to post communist russia or belarus . 
  our tax system is rather complex , but most citizens never deal with it . 
  sales tax , for example , is included by the store into the price , so the sticker you see on a shelf will be exactly what you pay for it . 
  most of your other taxes - healthcare , pension , income , and potentially religion if you belong to a church - are automatically handled between your employer and the government , and you receive the difference . 
  it 's generally efficient , saves you a lot of hassle , and results in less fraud . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever dealt with the german tax system personally , as i never lived permanently in germany as an adult , but as an american citizen living in america , i *** have *** dealt with the american system , which i 'm sure you 're quite familiar with . 
  i consider the german approach superior in every respect , but that 's just my opinion . 
  germany has a ton , so here we go : ** good things : ** denmark : beautiful climate , lovely cities , a real sense of history , a lot like schleswig-holstein honestly - and that 's a good thing poland : has some very friendly people , lots of untouched nature czech republic : ca n't say i have been there or know many people from czechia , sorry ... switzerland : beautiful mountains , people that actually care about their trains and do n't have the shitty customer service we do , stronger privacy protection laws austria : german speaking ( - ish ) , generally filled with happier people than anywhere you can find in germany , more willing to break with tradition than we are france : exports lots of excellent food belgium : contains the eu 's headquarters , so we do n't have to deal with the traffic - also , excellent chocolate luxembourg : also ca n't say i know very much about luxembourg , sorry netherlands : far more progressive than we are , generally pretty intelligent , dutch is sort of intelligible on occasion ** bad things : ** denmark : danish people generally are n't very friendly , at least not at first , and this is coming from a north german poland : people from here can be very conservative , which is rather unfortunate czech republic : see above switzerland : some swiss can be * incredibly * arrogant and snobbish , exceeding even the us in many respects austria : they speak like bavarians france : ... different standards of body hygiene ... belgium : ca n't think of anything particularly bad , perhaps a little generic luxembourg : see above netherlands : they sound like a drunk german with a sock in his mouth, 
  the afd loves to pull this card , especially when challenging the conservative vote with the cdu . 
  for the most part , this has n't been very successful - germans generally like safe and predictable , and the afd 's weakness with handling the mundane and less glamorous is a strong liability . 
  furthermore , their response to this has been to lean even more strongly to the right and alienate the moderates they have , which has caused a huge crash in their poll numbers . 
  overall , not very well . 
  you are a troll with an account less than a day old . 
  have the balls and post here with your real account . 
  just look at what you are saying . 
  you honestly believe there is absolutely no difference between a war criminial and a murder ? 
  you think every single crime is an action against the state ? 
  that 's the sort of thing the ussr used to say when it existed . 
  it you would like to live in a tolitarian police state , there are several in existence ; russia or china sound like great places for you . 
  if you are comitted to human rights , a western country does not . 
  somebody outside germany of course will more about our correctional facilities than the people who live here , hmm ? 
  the truth is that you are right about one thing . 
  judges * are * less likely to incarcerate , because minor violations do not carry minimum sentencing . 
  if you steal a handbag , you will be sentenced to community service , not 5 years in prison which will destroy your life and turn you into a much more dangerous person . 
  the same goes for drug offenders ; rehabilitation and therapy , not jailing . 
  if you ask me , petty theft is not the sort of crime we should spend thousands of dollars per year jailing , nor is it worth the amount of damage it does to a person 's life . 
  furthermore , assuming you are an american ( i ca n't see flairs on mobile ) , you may wish to take a look at how your country actually treats it 's prisoners . 
  if a foreign country kidnapped citizens , refused to provide a reason why or even acknowledge that they were captured , and then execute them , you are trying to tell me that would n't bother you ? 
  our flag is rarely displayed because it is considered poor manners to wave it around , but you will sometimes see it flown during soccer season or around other special events . 
  germany 's flag has a fairly long history , and has flip flopped quite a bit , but it definitely symbolizes the republic and the power of democracy vs our old various kingdoms . 
  i actually like seeing it , and i wish we would do so more often , although it does seem silly to me to have one in your office our outside your home all the time . 
  one has bavaria , the other essentially * is * bavaria one is right leaning , one is left leaning one is relatively immigrant friendly , the other is most decidedly not one is part of the eu , the other is n't, 
  not really , there are significant differences between high german and swiss german . 
  as someone from the northern parts , i would seriously struggle to be able to follow anything more than a very simple conversation , and while i think the difference is larger , it 's almost certain that no swiss german would be able to get more than a few words ' meaning out of a paragraph of plattdeutsch . 
  well , bavaria * does * have a secessionist movement . 
  it may not have as much support as scotland 's does , but that 's more a matter of practicality ; germany right now is doing quite well , and bavaria has more independence than scotland does because germany is a federal republic as opposed to a unitary one like the uk . 
  if i recall , if your baby is a german citizen and you are not , there is a special visa that lets you live in germany to take care of your child . 
  it 's rather difficult to take advantage of however , since you have to actually live in germany to keep it , having a child and moving will only give citizenship to the child . 
  additionally , you will also be fully responsible for your child potentially all the way through university/college , and that is something you and your partner will definitely want to keep in mind . 
  germany is not a country where having a child to milk a tax credit is a viable endeavor , you will want to think long and hard about this before committing to a child . 
  most germans use birth control or at the very least a condom , and so hopefully you wo n't have as much of a risk with accidents . 
  i also feel as though it 's worth mentioning , there are several countries such as [ denmark ] ( https://www.spies.dk/do-it-for-denmark ) that are active in the birth tourism industry , so if you are an american citizen and your partner is german , having a baby in denmark could potentially give your child three citizenships . 
  having parents from two countries is how i got my two passports , although not through birth tourism admittedly . 
  i actually had a great experience working with my local government , in schleswig-holstein . 
  being a rural state with a fairly low population , it did sometimes take time for paperwork to get processed , but it always did get done in the end and the people were usually honest and helpful . 
  of course , i have n't lived there in a while , so for all i know it 's changed by now ... 
  many people characterize us as emotionless robots focused on maximum efficiency . 
  we may value boring stability and have a dry sense of humor , but that does n't make us any less human than anybody else . 
  we have our art , our culture ( however boring it may be ) , and our hobbies , just like you . 
  we also have kickass vacation benefits , so i do n't want to hear americans play the spiel that they spend more time having fun than we do . 
  the average german gets * far * more time off and works fewer hours than the average american does . 
  once every two or three days . 
  i do n't produce very much body odor or have a lot of body hair to keep clean , so bathing every day would be excessive . 
  op is of indian descent , and will most certainly not be assumed to be american at first glance . 
  ahh , i spot the dane  once upon a time , but as we have the land , we get to pick the name . 
  although , i 'm sure the frisians would disagree with both of us , as they named it * s\u00f6l * ... 
  sylt as well , it 's been an ongoing problem for decades . 
  cynically , that investment in flood dikes and tetrapods paid off ... 
  umm , you can travel to denmark to buy ... furniture ? 
  realistically , everything is quite a bit more expensive in denmark , so it usually makes more sense to buy in germany . 
  however , i very much like denmark , so if you like scandinavia , being close is a benefit !, 
  i assure you , this can go both ways . 
  well , we are cousins , at least with your western half . 
  we are both descended from the same father , holy roman empire , we share the same language , and we even shared many of the same politics . 
  you may not wish to join us , but we still have a closer relationship than poland or france . 
  franconia !, 
  how nice , i have a relative who lives in bayreuth . 
  he does actually mention water being rather expensive ... 
  well , most people consider the 12 years from 1933 to 1945 to be pretty interesting . 
  [ my ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=78.0&amp;d=75.0&amp;g=76.9&amp;s=88.2 ) results , as someone who has lived between the us and germany .

  in schleswig-holstein , there are many blonds , definitely . 
  however , there are also plenty of brunettes as well ; it 's not nearly as strong as , say , norway or iceland , where almost everyone has lightly colored hair and eyes . 
  i identify as a democratic socialist , and while i think both communism and pure capitalism are noble attempts , both are unrealistically idealistic and fail in the real world . 
  communism inherently places too much power in a person or single group of people ; while i know russia 's influence has largely corrupted it , i do n't think a communistic state could last on its own long term . 
  on the flip side , pure capitalism does n't work either ; it exposes those of a lower class to abuse from above , and actively encourages social stratification ; even the us relies on many socialist institutions such as socialized pensions and utility infastructure to balance this , and even then the us ranks last or near last among first world countries in almost every area of standard of living / quality of life . 
  a hybrid of the two , a fundamentally free market backed by a large government that guarantees a strong social safety net and socialises instructions that are in the public 's interest , such as education , transportation infastructure , and healthcare , is the best way forward - in my humble opinion . 
  probably canada . 
  very vast country with beautiful nature and friendly people . 
  if not that , then japan , assuming i could find employment and meet the entrance qualifications . 
  truly a remarkable land , if it were easier to immigrate i probably move it ahead of canada . 
  i did n't mean to include austria or switzerland , only spain / portugal . 
  austria or switzerland do n't make particularly attractive vacations either , since bayern has all the skiing and mountaineering ... 
  given that no time is mentioned here , i think the american president john f. kennedy would make a fantastic chancellor . 
  however , despite my gripes about merkel , i do admit that she 's not nearly as bad as some other leaders of the world ( ahem ... trump ... ) , and can actually lead and manage the state . 
  i use the dishwasher , naturally , as it both saves me the time and uses far less water and soap then i would . 
  we would also scold the devil for being an idiot and not investing in robotic guard equipment , which has been mathematically proven by karl from fleissig tech to be 20 % more cost effective and 40 % more productive over the lifespan of the cauldron . 
  probably austria , or maybe switzerland ? 
  ehh .
