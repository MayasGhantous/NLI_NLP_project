because of the [ sunni shiite conflict ] ( http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/blogs/uploads/2013/06/sunni-shia-map-pew.jpg ) . 
  not saying that should be a viable excuse , but thats the situation we are dealing with . 
  this issue to settle is not done quick , but the refugees need help now . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i agree that the more western refugees are , the more easier it gets to integrate them . 
  but i ca n't base my decision on it , when people are actually fleeing from war . 
  people who try to use such a situation for their own economic improvement will be send back . 
  this is not so easy in any case , but if the eu would stand as one , this process would be easier to negotiate with the orign countries also . 
  edit : most african and arab countries lack the basic infrastructure ( health , housing , food ) for refugees . 
  and why should they shoulder this responsibility alone ? 
  the west is heavily involved in those conflicts . 
  so they make a difference because of orign of refugees ? 
  because this is the [ border to germany ] ( http://i.imgur.com/clxt4bx.jpg ) right now and this is the [ border to uk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iog9ryi.jpg ) . 
  brexit happend because of immigrants and refugees fear of uk !, 
  do n't get your point you are tryin to make ? 
  not such as black and white as you make it . 
  all polls show that the accession of crimea to russia is backed by a overwhelming proportion of the population . 
  i am not saying that i approve the measures taken by russia , but dont let 's pretend that was done by some russian refugees . 
  the relationship between russia and the former soviet countries is much more complex than most of the press makes it to be . 
  i am proud of my home country and disappointed by many other european countries . 
  obviously its not easy to integrate refugees in the society , but its worth it from the humanitarian standpoint . 
  if other countries would share that burden with us , it would be alot easier and we could even profit from the situation , because europe is in despair for skilled workers . 
  i love different cultures and lets be honest : nobody will take your country away . 
  bild.de-section ( nsfw ) : http://www.bild.de/news/bild-girl-des-monats/bild-girl/home-16645154.bild.html the naked girls got banned from page 1 though ( around 2012 ) , but still are part of the daily print newspaper . 
  that just shows , how backwardly the russian society is . 
  thats some 1984 level shit . 
  creepy as fuck !, 
  creepy as fuck !, 
  so you think that this 5 students and ( other not named students in the article ) made up this story , went to a news outlet and they and their director fell for it ? 
  just to make poland look bad ? 
  you think this is more likely ? 
  we have made the full circle : go and seek help in a mental hospital !, 
  article : statements of mert , omar , seydanur , isra , buket and the director . 
  your ` evidence ' : this can not have happened because people would n't do something like that . 
  a narcissist 's prayer : that did n't happen . 
  and if it did , it was n't that bad . 
  and if it was , that 's not a big deal . 
  and if it is , that 's not my fault . 
  and if it was , i did n't mean it . 
  and if i did ... you deserved it . 
  except its not a trial , its a statement to the press about what they have witnessed . 
  watched too much csi ? 
  =  a dna test would n't even be considered for this kind of crime ... 
  your conclusion that because ` people ' would n't stand around when a 13yo girl got spit on is laughable . 
  did you have considered that this could have been done without anyone directly noticing ? 
  what can a foreign class with 13 year olds do , when a grown up pole walks by and decides to spit on them and when they turn to police they get laughed at ? 
  before you argue that this did n't happen : * the memorial office will now be working with its polish partners to evaluate the incidents - director jasch will also write a letter to the polish ambassador in berlin . 
  he is especially annoyed that the police obviously did not help the youths in at least one case . 
  * and once again : the guy who tries to legitimate such behaviour tries to spin it so that i am the xenophobic ... 
  the students are backing her side , the teacher is backing her side and the director of the school also . 
  translates roughly to : `` i am especially shocked that this has happened to the young people , who are also entrusted to us for this trip and on a trip where they are dealing with this topic . 
  this is especially sad . 
  such a behavior towards juveniles can not be tolerated and must be clearly contradicted . '', 
  the article also includes the statements of all three girls . 
  i have never said the 13yo girl got beaten . 
  she got spit on and her and other muslim girls were insulted constantly . 
  but this does not make it any better !, 
  its funny that the guy who tries to legitimate such behaviour , writes in capslock when in rage and insults when he has n't any arguments left , talks about declining iq . 
  handicapped is not an insult , when it is an assessment of your current situation . 
  this was a 13 year old girl on a schooltrip ... and you wan na find arguments to legitimate such behaviour . 
  this just shows me that you have alot of hate in your life and this is why i feel sad for you !, 
  as you seem to be some kind of handicapped , i do n't wan na waste my time . 
  i hope your actual situation is just a snapshot of your life . 
  if not i really feel sad for you !, 
  go seek help in a mental hospital !, 
  go seek help in a mental hospital !, 
  you are fucking disgusting racist !, 
  what has this 13 year old girl done to you ? 
  you hate her just because she grew up in a muslim household ? 
  you should be expelled from europe !, 
  the comments on the bottom are hilarious and scary at the same time . 
  ca n't believe that so much braindead people are walking among us . 
  it 's sad to see that the country i loved to visit is turning in another middle eastern shithole . 
  at the current pace we will see sharia like law in 5-10 years . 
  i hope turkey can turn things around !, 
  edit : english, 
  the huge amount of deaths in the grenfell tower would have been preventable when they would have choosen a more fire resistant cladding ( costs would have been around 5.000 # ) , which should also be a regulation for such high buildings . 
  ( as this is public housing the government failed on both accounts ) a forest fire like this is n't so easily preventable . 
  therefor there is n't so much anger involved , but this does not mean that the rest of the world cares less about the individual loss of lifes . 
  do n't forget elmo [ all opponents of may ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/db2hvxwvwaiwods.jpg:large ) [ elmo & may ] ( https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/uploads/businessinsider/2017/06/maidenhead.jpg ), 
  do you live in some kind of bubble ? 
  sch\u00e4uble has an iron image of not giving an inch . 
  this was the first time he admitted , that some kind of wealth transfer is necessary for a greater european integration . 
  he is the reason that germany has a account surplus . 
  he is a real deal maker ( not like the one claiming in the white house )  and to your question . 
  yes i do like relatives and even more important i like the ability to pay back those debts . 
  you do need to put these numbers in perspective to the ability of welth generation . 
  you can not compare debt without looking at the debtor . 
  the ability of paying back the debt differs greatly . 
  who would you rather lend money : a child with a monthly pocket money of 10 $ or an employee with a monthly income of 2.000 $ ? 
  external debt includes private debt ... where is the relation with the account surplus of the german government ? 
  in percent of gdp germany has still a much lower debt than other european members including private debt . 
  from your table : - germany 148 % - netherlands 525 % - uk 314 % - ireland 780 % - greece 246 % still not convinced ... 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  germany has n't borrowed money on a federal level since 2012 . 
  we have paid back around 10 % of our debt in the last 7 years alone . 
  in comparison to other european members , the debt is relatively low : - uk 87 % - france 95 % - spain 99 % - portugal 129 % - italy 132 % - greece 177 % * - germany 67 % * please do n't just pull numbers out of your ass ... edit : english , 
  http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201612-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile 2016 : syria 270k ( 36 % ) afghanistan 130k ( 17,5 % ) iraq 100k ( 13,5 % ) iran 30k ( 4 % ) eritrea 20k ( 2,7 % ) albania 18k ( 2,4 % ) other 177k ( 23,5 % ) overall 745k, 
  yes , but we did not !, 
  the refugees camps were totally underfunded .
