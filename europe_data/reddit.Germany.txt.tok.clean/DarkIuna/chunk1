ah no , i do n't think so . 
  basically it says that in the long run the combination linux and open office is the most desireable , but the cheapest short term transition is the update on windows xp and microsoft office . 
  this was made 2003 , so it 's a bit outdated , but i think linux would be an even better option today . 
  i tried to translate the table : effort to follow the existing laws impact on it-security impact on the employees impact on it-organisation impact on extern recipients realisation of other important points, 
  i actually had today a lecture today with the guys , who evaluated the advantages of the change , i 'm not kidding . 
  [ look on page 24 ] ( http://www.muenchen.info/pia/clientstudie_kurz.pdf ) the combination linux/oss had 6.2 / 10 points , with big advantages in security and it-organisation, 
  they are bashing op solely for the title not the content . 
  i think most people here are against a russian crimea, 
  yes we can, 
   demonstrations and human chains are clearly the same thing so where is the point of this whole conversation ? 
  we both agree that a [ human chain is a demonstration ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_chain ) and that the [ baltic way ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_way ) was bigger . 
  i 'm not arguing that you * might * not have the record , i am saying you do n't have it , i do n't even get what you are trying to tell me . 
  i admit that i do n't know much about the situation of barcelona and spain , but it 's not like you get independent only if this is a record . 
  i sympathize with you guys and wish you success , but i 'm not going to lie and agree that this is a record only because you feel better about that . 
  boy you sound like you really want this record, 
  than you were in the wrong part of mallorca , there are beautiful places !, 
  but the tourists are everywhere , you are right , although not always drunk . 
  but actually it was more a joke , because every second person is german and everyone can speak german . 
  austria for me , i love the country . 
  ^ also ^ mallorca ^ but ^ i 'm ^ ^ better ^ ^ ^ quiet ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that, 
  well , his name is thor and i believe this godly title was indeed given to him by his parents  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2edemz/richest_people_of_europe_xpost_rmapporn/cjyhg2r, 
  and is n't that the only imagineable response ? 
  america can not do nothing when that happens , i feel like we jumped right back in the cold war, 
  no i 'm a guy . 
  it 's nothing alike . 
  i was always told that i 'm too thin and i have huge hunger when i work physically a lot . 
  but on my normal days i do not enjoy eating . 
  that is such a weird feeling for me . 
  i do n't like to eat . 
  i just do it , because i need it to live . 
  everytime i eat too much , i feel like shit for two hours . 
  not because i think `` i ate too much i get fat '' , but my body needs all its power for digestion . 
  but i totally understand your point of view , i 'm also addicted to various things . 
  what 's that on the north coast of alaska ? 
  in german ` butterbrot ' is buttered bread . 
  and the ukrainian borrowed the word . 
  ( i think they use it for all kinds of sandwichs , not only bread with butter . ), 
  watch this one . 
  worked 100 % of the time i watched . 
  http://www.ustream.tv/channel/euromajdan/pop-out they also interview the people . 
  now i know that the ukrainian also say ` butterbrot ' . 
  very interesting , 
  you are implying the main task of police is to fight . 
  but this is an extreme situation ( hopefully ) , especially at the gay parade . 
  and in very extreme situations they have there equipment , pepper spray and guns . 
  strength is necessary , but is n't the most important attribute of a police man / woman . 
  edit : sorry , now i see that you already talked about this arguments . 
  i will not change my comment , because it 's still my opinion . 
  who volunteers for the csu ? 
  anyone ? 
  ouch my feelings , it hurts , it hurts so much . 
  yeah , well , that 's just , like , your opinion man . 
  japan was no colony . 
  i think . 
  japan was no colony . 
  i think . 
  japan was no colony . 
  i think . 
  add new zealand to that list . 
  because a tv show will destroy your culture and traditions . . 
  where did you get your information ? 
  he was shot , but in the article is n't declared where . 
  she got stabbed in the neck and shot ( once ) in the liver . 
  nothing about drugs . 
  do you have another source ? 
  so , why is this knife attack suddenly a beheading ? 
  that 's awesome, 
  please explain yourself, 
  so why the fuck are you saying i should talk with people . 
  why are we arguing if you do n't disagree ? 
  oh wow , so funny . 
  i do . 
  even my cdu grandparents have more empathy than you i guess . 
  the huge majority wants to help them . 
  see , i can also make unsourced statements, 
  i 've yet to speak with a single person that is not okay with it . 
  i do n't know , the refugee tent at the university said they could use some shoes . 
  there is also a website that is offering the refugees activities . 
  there is much to do  in 2 hours i 'm in munich , wonder what the situation is at the train station, 
  fuck , you 're right :d only one roundabout in the center though, 
  it 's american though . 
  sun cities were build as retirement cities , roundabouts with businesses in the core, 
  i do n't get his logic . 
  i will not be less angry at the usa when other countries do the same shit . 
  i will just be more angry at other countries, 
  what 's the logic behind that ? 
  the mods make the sub private in protest ( wrong move ) , i want to access the sub . 
  in no way would leaving make any sense or provide an advantage for me . 
  actually i would partake in this childish protest , that 's the opposite of what i want . 
  we are indeed, 
  fuck , i 'm completely with you here . 
  the mods see the small opportunity to gain some might and like most people they they try to take it . 
  reddit is a website , they do n't owe you nothing . 
  if you hate reddit from on second to the other , just leave, 
  this whole argument is only on an emotional level . 
  now the mods try to agitate the users to help their power struggle . 
  they see the small chance to destroy someone 's life and they take it shamelessly, 
  this stuff smells like might-hungry admins . 
  i did n't know it and am glad that he said that, 
  yes,
