why is it racist to call out the reality ? 
  black people have black skincolour , when we think that black = bad we already are racist . 
  it 's sweet of the interviewer not to try to smile or laugh . 
  quite an old study . 
  you should get newer sources !, 
  feminism is something different . 
  you ca n't critizise wbc and say you do n't understood christianity, 
  ehm ... eu is multiculturalism , kind of . 
  in one nation it is only shitty when let free . 
  people have to know the rules and laws of the nation they live in and need to mix their culture with the culture of their home . 
  but it 's only oppression when women are oppressed !, 
  edit : / s someone did n't get this as sarcastic phrase . 
  but russia is almost winning !, 
  as a german : hahaha ( evil laughter . ), 
   i 'd still recommend the early-ish pfefferk\u00f6rner episodes in particular . 
  well , i was that age when they started . 
  now as adult in germany , sometimes [ `` karambolage '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karambolage_%28arte%29 ) or [ `` le dessous des cartes '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le_dessous_des_cartes ) ( mit offenen karten ) made by arte . 
  i 'm not interested in other shows anymore . 
  as kid i watched many shows for children . 
  [ die sendung mit der maus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_sendung_mit_der_maus ) [ l\u00f6wenzahn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%b6wenzahn ) [ pumuckl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pumuckl ) [ der tigerentenclub ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tigerenten_club ) [ schloss einstein ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schloss_einstein ) [ die pfefferk\u00f6rner ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_pfefferk%c3%b6rner ) maybe other germans will help my memory . 
  sorry for the `` long '' post , but i ca n't decide and waited for a chance to show others the tv shows of my childhood . 
  when ireland was in the crisis they showed pedestrians who blamed germany for this . 
  city ? 
  that 's more of a town . 
  50.000 people is not a city . 
  but cool , that my region capital is on the europe sub . 
  well that 's too much for me , now . 
  maybe later . 
  how much did you pay for that trip ? 
  why is there nothing about germany ? 
  united depts of america , pay your own . 
  you personal are richer thatn nations ? 
  now we wait for the catalon-americans who scream for this independence . 
  oh man , my parents are still there for vacation . 
  i did n't even vote for her party !, 
  and how can only you be responsible for actions your ancestors did ? 
  why for example people be called nazi just because they were born in germany ? 
  but this time we get our piece from the beginning . 
  a film is pefect , when you do n't understand anything , but you still watch it . 
  i though you already had snow in september . 
  vaasa seemed to have some . 
  we always have an orion calender in our flat community . 
  the women ignore it . 
  i wanted to read `` vaasa '' . . 
  the one guy who said `` hello '' and `` high-five '' looks like someone i know . 
  where was this recorded ? 
  edit : no , he 's not the one i meant . 
  there are many famous germans nobody outside of germany knows . 
  or germany 's canada ? 
  are they producing everything which they need ? 
  interesting . 
  how much did you pay for all of this and what kind of transportation did you go there ? 
  really ? 
  i never heard someone saying `` that country belongs to us . '', 
  maybe there are some who wants back some parts in poland and some who thinks that mallorca is already a german island . 
  and btw : if you did n't know , germany had these [ borders ] ( http://www.dhm.de/lemo/objekte/karten/d1920/index.gif ) before ww2, 
  there are people who do . 
  almost every week i read something about hitler , the nazis or ww2 . 
  which `` neither '' ? 
   well it 's how many iraqis and afghans see it and that 's good enough for me !, 
   regardless of that , they had nothing to do with empire , if so we did a pretty bad job with the whole facilitating democratic elections and leaving after a few years thing , no ? 
  iraq was part of the british empire and i though even afghanistan was . 
  i 'm from near cologne in germany and there are so many songs about the carnival . 
  and there is this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivhjuk1entg, 
  maybe it is a bit like the thing with the jewish people . 
  in german school the children always get told , that germany started a war and wanted to kill the jews and their first target were poland . 
  i think many just fear that they do something wrong and just do n't want to talk to you out of fear or pity . 
  we had some romanian students with us some months ago . 
  different to the other european students almost all romanians could speak german . 
  was very interesting and they were friendlier than the others especially the finnish students . 
  after reading some other commentsection in this sub , i believe here are all the right , while on the rest of reddit there are the `` left '' ppl . 
  when i search for that i get this : `` germany is an occupied country and it will stay that way '', 
  never knew belgium was in germany , that 's why they were ignored in all those world wars . 
  gta : germany to asia . 
  i 'm twisted . 
  on one hand i agree with him , when someone comes to a new country to work and life , then you should learn the language . 
  ok , most elder people are not that well with a new language anymore . 
  hm yes , i forgot this a moment . 
  just look to the rhine-erft-kreis and you will see how close the politicians are with rwe . 
  do you think this is a fucking game ? 
  hitler was real , just saying . 
   sounds like you need to learn to vote and then accept the majority . 
  that 's democracy . 
  at first you tell lordofthejungle , he should not whine about something bad , because it 's `` democracy '' because these people in england got voted in their positions . 
  it sounds like : `` we should accept everything when it 's democracy , because it 's democracy . '', 
  then please tell me , how hitler and the nsdap were good , because they came to power through democracy . 
  no , but he got into power through democracy . 
  the people voted for him . 
  jup , that 's what hitler said 1933 . 
  nah , we had no holocaust in the first one . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_war_crimes_during_world_war_ii oh hey , look what i found, 
  you sent them back ? 
  i whough there were camps with axis and allies for whom the war was over . 
  well i did not hear anything from that , maybe i live too far in the north ? 
  i never get it how people vote for someone and their reason is : `` because they should end , what they 've begun . '', 
  as always : `` wait . . netherlands have birthday ? 
  damn , next time we will give them something . '', 
  like you liberated the indians ? 
  funny thing when you are german , in transylvania they understand you . 
  we had some romanian stundents here and some of them were better in german than in english .
