  * why do we * have * to import another culture if we can just reproduce ourselves ? 
  and why is there a double standard for europe ? 
  do you see china and japan get any flak at all ? 
  no native would have said that . 
  absolutely no one , because they understand how the system works . 
  nobody was implying it was genocide except you . 
  why not motivate natives to reproduce ? 
  you may call it the decline of an ethnicity by indirect means of another . 
  you forgot the `` you 're paying for it . '', 
  the attitude was the point of the story , and that stays no matter how the story is told . 
  it 's a strange world where any race can point this out * about itself except whites . 
  that should be called racism , but because it 's whites , it 's not . 
  yeah we are fucked, 
  what you did there was you picked one idiot and assumed it applied to the whole group . 
   a few months ago the mainstream was typically relatively left-leaning and pro-eu , nowadays very vapid criticisms of the eu are typically pushed to the top of threads . 
  a few months back the same comments are right at the bottom of the thread , downvoted to oblivion . 
  in any hotly-debated issue , avoid the side which needs to censor content to remain credulous . 
  guess whose side that is right now . 
  i did n't say that staying white is * superior * . 
  i can say that i prefer math without saying all other subjects are inferior . 
  it 's what i happen to like , but my taste is not objective . 
  in the same way i can say that i like my ethnicity without saying others are inferior . 
  pardon the accusation . 
  post has been deleted . 
  but `` for this post '' ? 
  he was in fact [ shadowbanned ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l9scezc.png ) . 
  or freedom of speech . 
  a circlejerk is where no real discussion is taking place , so no . 
  this has already started to happen with so few refugees . 
  there are talks about importing 500,000 refugees * a year * into my country . 
  i think a big part of the problem is 1 . 
  none of these people have actually lived in a multicultural neighborhood 2 . 
  this is a giant circlejerk where you post to facebook ' i love refugees ' and get likes , thus brainwashing the entire population, 
  yep , a [ fantasy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ka2iw/school_in_bavaria_has_sent_a_letter_home_to/ ) . 
  again , wanting to preserve your country 's ethnicity is not racist . 
  racist : white europeans are superior to all others not racist : i would prefer it if we retained our ethnicity, 
  white supremacism ? 
  what the fuck . 
  since when is wanting to retain your ethnic culture racist ? 
  should we just bend over ? 
  and why is europe the only fucking continent that is held to this standard ? 
  do you think china , japan , and the middle east would not protest ? 
  all racists are anti-immigrant , but not all those who are anti-immigrant are racist . 
  we have to account for the change in attitude over the centuries . 
  we are not burning witches anymore ( though muslims are still stoning women to death for adultery ) . 
  i do n't know , the far right has n't been this popular in a long time . 
  after the migrants started pouring in . 
  haha , [ you were saying ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k33jf/dutch_government_take_refugees_directly_from/ ), 
  think for a second - maybe there is a reason for that . 
  indeed , this is / r/europe , for matters concerning europe . 
  low-quality content ( which mine was not ) is usually given a reason for being removed . 
  indeed . 
  that news source links to another , trustworthy news source . 
  the circle of life . 
  stay on new for a while , and you 'll see . 
  [ mine ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k2w57/calais_migrants_set_fire_to_150kg_of_clothes/ ) was removed without explanation . 
  there 's also dclauzel 's direct admittance to censorship . 
  he said `` islamophobia or censorship '' or something like that . 
  or the guy that was banned for posting two interviews from lesbos which depicted a negative view of immigrants . 
  edit - it 's the posts that depict immigrants in a negative light that get removed almost always . 
  yes , they are . 
  the vast majority of them . 
  he should not have that in the title . 
  the woman said north african descent , though . 
  yep , a double standard if i ever saw one . 
  if you need to censor content to keep your stance justified , there 's something wrong with your stance . 
  conflicts in turkey , greece , serbia , hungary , austria and france ? 
  wtf ? 
  yep , spot on . 
  they are not fleeing for their lives , so they are more likely to consider luxuries like selfie sticks . 
  i imagine one 's selfie stick is not what you would take with you if you were running for your life . 
  the front page is filled with it is because it 's national headlines everywhere . 
  reuters , you can see the watermark . 
  he bans people for pointing this image out . 
  he also just removed a submission where i showed immigrants burning 150kg of clothes , without explanation . 
  it is too late , the wize wizards of / r/europe mountain have spoken . 
  you may only talk about how dissimilar the word for hotdog is in spanish and norwegian . 
  does n't australia send them to some island ? 
  we should do that . 
  i mean not accept as in not granting them a permit to stay or permit for asylum . 
  i mean we ca n't really stop them from coming in , but we can send them back after we 've given them food and shelter . 
  or just not accept them in the first place ... 
  oh my god , i have n't logged in for a month but i will just for your comment a person who immigrates to france from syria is immigrating to france , but emigrating from syria this is the simplest concept in existence, 
  * note : no advocation for nazis , merely pointing out a logical error * the nazis also breathed air like you . 
  you applied the [ association fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/association_fallacy ) ; just because the nazis did it does n't mean it was bad , though anyone with a nazi ideology should be frozen and resurrected never . 
   so does the bible . 
  but we can not define christians and jews according to what is written in their book unless they are fundamentalists . 
  why do you assume that people who are fleeing war are fundamentalists ? 
  any evidence ? 
  78 % of british muslims think that publish of mohammed cartoons should be punished . 
  there are more fundamentals than you think . 
   of course it is . 
  every `` argument '' the right-wing currently has is blatant nazi propaganda . 
  they are opportunistic populists who spread fear about immigrants and appeal to nationalism , etc. 
  do you realize how ridiculous you sound ? 
   what is news i disagree with ? 
  the nazi propaganda ? 
   the leftists are on the wrong side ? 
  what are leftists wrong about exactly ?
