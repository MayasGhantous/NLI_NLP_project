  unhindered immigration from radically different cultures will result in problems . 
  did you know that 78 % of british muslims want mohammed cartoon publishers to be punished ? 
   even though the nazi-propaganda is powerful and convinced lots of people there we go again . 
  this is n't nazi propaganda , it 's news you disagree with . 
   the right-wing usually does n't . 
  which is the problem . 
  whoever are on the wrong side will do that . 
  leftists are now , and you can see how the media behaves . 
  no , but we should be intolerant of intolerance . 
  they do n't need to want murder , i 'm worried about free speech . 
  i 'm not for christians either . 
  if you can show me numbers as high as 78 % for christians then that 's bad , but that does n't make islam better . 
  this is called whataboutism . 
   again : i strongly disagree with such religious outlooks . 
  but having them does not make people instant terrorists . 
  do n't put words in my mouth . 
  you can say that about every single opinion statistic that 's ever been recorded . 
  an opinion is an opinion , and this opinion is unacceptable . 
  the website has an agenda , but its sources are from all over . 
  you can just click the `` read more '' for the original sources . 
  [ source for 78 % ( cbs news ) ] ( http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/14/opinion/main1893879.shtml&amp;date=2011-04-06 ), 
  * some * is a weak word for 78 % . 
  i understand what you mean , but it 's hard to call it xenophobia when , for example , 78 % of british muslims want mohammed cartoon publishers to be punished , or that 40 % of indonesian muslims said they would use violence against blasphemy of islam . 
  [ source ] ( http://wikiislam.net/wiki/muslim_statistics ) of course , those who 're afraid of foreigners without reason are xenophobic . 
  that 's what pc is * meant * to be , but like everything , it 's been taken to its extremity , which is pretty much censorship . 
  shit dude , not everything is an oppressive nazi raid on your beliefs just because the majority now disagrees with you . 
  start thinking about whether what people have to say has some value . 
  stop waving that word around to whatever disagrees with you . 
  xenophobia is an * irrational * fear of foreigners . 
  it 's quite clear from this crisis that it is n't entirely irrational . 
   take what risk ? 
  that muslims will suddenly become 67 % of the population in belgium and all these muslims will suddenly all vote for a sharia party ? 
  you consider that a likely risk ? 
  they do n't have to become 67 % of the population to have a sizable effect . 
   what was your point ? 
  did you ever have any , or was i just supposed to become scared because `` oh my god there are muslims in europe '' ? 
  my point was that islam will grow in number compared to others . 
   i 'm going to completely disregard the fact ( which you seem to have missed ) that even with that extremely liberal and vague interpretation of that meaning `` pro sharia '' it 's still a minority of a minority , not with the point you 've just admitted to me , that islam is the fastest growing in europe . 
   then why do plenty of muslim countries do not have it as a base of their law ? 
  i do n't know , maybe muslim european immigrants become more conservative . 
  who are we to assume ? 
  all we have is the trouble in europe . 
   yet suddenly , for some vague reason in your vague projection all muslims in europe will suddenly want sharia ? 
  they do n't `` suddenly '' want it , i just reminded you of the 4 out of 10 . 
  the same exact story can be said of [ russian muslim migrants ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/ ) : 42 % , while the number is lower in muslim majority countries . 
  i do n't know why that is , but i 'm not going to wait for other countries to get a muslim majority . 
  ** edit ** i would like to point out that the dear muslim countries you mentioned still want sharia as law : 43 % in albania , 32 % bosnia , 28 % kosovo . 
  that 's still too high . 
   you were the one claiming muslims would suddenly vote for different parties if their numbers grew , so you were the one with the projection . 
  do n't try to fob it off on me . 
  the future is complicated , and neither of us can say for sure . 
  i 'll not take that risk , thanks . 
   that website excludes turkey from the numbers , for some reason . 
  with turkey the amount is ( very ) comfortably over 10 % . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe turkey is not included in the definition of europe , and if you want to include them , then the 2050 projection will just increase with that as well . 
  not sure what your point here is . 
   in not a single country on that list ( even with a 90 % + percentage of muslims ) a single pro-sharia party has ever been elected . 
  did n't you see the link i posted to / r/europe which said that 4 out of 10 muslims want sharia in part in denmark as law ? 
   what 's with the dumb questions ? 
  you 're the one asking leading questions . 
  how about you answer them yourself if you 're going to reply like this ? 
  why should i trust this dubious projection ? 
  edit : it was ** you ** who first asked the leading question . 
  answer it yourself , please . 
   more than 10 % of europeans are already muslim , so that 's not the most surprising of findings . 
  in fact , that 's a pretty dumb thing to put in a study . 
  that 's not very true , it was 6 % in 2010 . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.muslimpopulation.com/europe/ ) website ( not sure about its validity ) it 's now 7.6 % . 
   they do n't vote for this party now , why would they vote for it if they `` grow in number '' ? 
  are you sure ? 
   also , plenty of muslims are `` native europeans '' and their `` fertility rate '' is the same as everyone else . 
  please do n't start with that stuff . 
  i would like to politely point out that you are wrong :  more than 10 % of europeans will be muslim , while the number of christians in europe will drop by 100 million [ by 2050 ] . 
  [ source ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/02/living/pew-study-religion/ ), 
  what do you think happens whe muslims grow in number ? 
  muslims have a higher fertility rate than native europeans . 
  all xenophobia entails fear of foreigners , but not all fear of foreigners entails xenophobia . 
  should we wait until it becomes a problem , then ? 
  he should n't be forced to be driven from his home city . 
  i think nazism is bad . 
   because it 's fucking stupid . 
  you 're moving goalposts now ? 
  i do n't know if you have good enough reading comprehension to understand , but what you said was n't implied . 
  edit your post appropriately if this was really what you meant ( it was n't ) . 
  them being silenced does not imply they 're being completely silenced . 
  they can mean that efforts are being made to silence them , and in many cases publicly shaming them , adversely affecting their livelihood . 
  in the quote . 
  you said they , compared with others , would not be annoyed by that name-calling . 
   not that `` ur a nazi xenophobe , fuck u '' is the sort of argument that actually annoys the `` fortress europe '' brigade anyway . 
  implying any who want `` fortress europe '' are nazis . 
  well , no , that does n't make it automatically incorrect . 
  do you not understand ? 
  you 're saying ` because they complain , they are incorrect . ', 
  do you not understand how this is illogical ? 
  no one is afraid , it 's how ridiculous it is when i 'm called a nazi for disagreeing with someone . 
   heh , i merely referred to those who , well , want to turn europe into a fortress . 
  honestly did n't spot the historical precedent . 
  grow a thicker skin , man . 
  and that ... implies ... nazism ? 
  sorry friend , i do n't follow .
