   `` i 'm persecuted by the pc brigade , and i ca n't speak my own mind anymore ! '', 
   it 's frankly pathetic . 
  your thought process is peculiar . 
  you seem to think that because people complain of pc persecution , they are automatically incorrect . 
  your confirmation bias is spectacular . 
  i 'll take ** native swedes ' ** word on it . 
  survey the thread . 
   saying `` ur a nazi xenophobe , fuck u '' may not be a very intelligent `` argument '' , but it does n't suppress a single thing . 
  uhhhh , yes it does . 
  that 's the purpose behind the phrase . 
  no one wants to be called a nazi . 
   not that `` ur a nazi xenophobe , fuck u '' is the sort of argument that actually annoys the `` fortress europe '' brigade anyway . 
  i was wondering when you would use the ` you 're a nazi ' argument . 
   turkey does n't want them , also . 
  turkey is legally prohobited from sending them anywhere if other countries do n't want them . 
  ** only ** the neighbouring countries are required by the geneva convention to grant them asylum . 
  the rest can , and should , send them to those neighbouring countries . 
   considering that the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries , that 's where we come in !, 
  we 'll help them in turkey and lebanon . 
   can not therefore be achieved without international co-operation wholeheartedly agree . 
  one can only hope, 
   romeneverfell * sniff * stay beautiful, 
  take a long and hard look at how you attempt to project the past onto the future . 
  germany will inevitably resort to nazism again , amirite ? 
   do not have the resources to keep them in or to offer them a reasonable standard of living . 
  that 's where we come in !, 
   then it 'll be the disabled , then it 'll be non-russian born russian citizens , then it 'll be the opposing side of the politics , then it 'll be anyone not from those people 's specific oblast until there is nobody left . 
  source ? 
   no one is importing people , they come here by themselves . 
  we make the choice of whether we accept them or not . 
   that it is n't restricted on the socioeconomic situation of the refugees because it is an emergency measure . 
  only the neighbouring countries are required to take them in . 
  the rest are permitted , and should , send them back to the neighbouring countries . 
   clearly an absolutely unbiased opinion . 
  careful . 
   radical assholes is that what you call people who disagree with you ? 
  i do n't think muslims disliking dogs is the problem , rather the expectation of whomever wrote that text . 
  that it was an ` islamic area . ', 
  yeah but they did n't incorporate said local culture into roman society as much as they let conquered territories be . 
  islam has not been the absolute majority religion for that long , no . 
  and its geographic influence was limited . 
  you were being disingenuous , that 's why you were downvoted . 
  end of story . 
  christendom has over 1,200 years history in europe . 
  those who downvoted you know you were trying to be apologetic toward this statistics . 
   i am just trying to explain the statistics and draw parallels between western and islamic conservative discourses of our modern times . 
  why ? 
  saying one group is bad too does n't negate another . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.wzb.eu/sites/default/files/u6/koopmans_englisch_ed.pdf ), 
  your argument is basically ` conservative christians do it too ? ', 
  i should let you know that devout muslims and devout christians differ greatly in number . 
  fortunately there are n't as many devout christians left . 
  christianity was pretty horrible in the middle ages , but that was in the middle ages , roughly 1,000 years ago . 
  guys what if every kebab joint in europe is a secret military base we 're fucked, 
  paywall .

  english translation : * nearly 4 out of 10 muslims in denmark wish that the koran must form the foundation of danish legislation . 
  11.3 per cent . 
  believe the koran alone must be the foundation of law , while 26.5 per cent . 
  considers that a mixture of the constitution and the koran must be the foundation . 
  it shows a poll by research institute wilke made for jyllands-posten . 
  system illegally , jens peter fr\u00f8lund thomsen , associate professor of political science at aarhus university and expert in integration , is surprised that only just over half - 53.9 per cent . 
  - the danish muslims support the constitution as the foundation for all legislation . 
  `` there is a majority , yes , but you may ask , why does almost everyone agrees with it . 
  however , it is completely fundamental to our democracy that the constitution is the framework for everything . 
  if you imagined that it was only half the danes felt the same way , then i think that would be a bit worried about the loyalty to our basic democratic form of government , `` he said . 
  jens peter fr\u00f8lund thomsen notes that 11 per cent . 
  pointing to the koran and 26 per cent . 
  in a mixture . 
  `` it must be said to be almost system unconstitutional . 
  the constitution is the per . 
  definition above all , and no one is above the constitution . 
  here 's an indicator that the religious beliefs that may interfere in some political perceptions and attitudes . 
  this secular society with political power and the law above all , it is nevertheless very many who have reservations about , `` says jens peter fr\u00f8lund thomsen : `` it shows that democratic standards are probably not just rooted among all immigrant groups . '', 
  non-islamic country radwan mansour is imam of the peace mosque in aarhus . 
  although he believes that the foundation of danish law should be a mixture of the constitution and the koran . 
  `` if it is an islamic country , it must be the koran . 
  but denmark is not an islamic country - we decide not - so i think it should be both the koran and the constitution , `` he says , who believe that the constitution and the quran goes a long way in harmony - and not mutually exclusive . 
  `` when it comes to justice , distribution of resources and so on . 
  there is a fine line , '' says radwan mansour , who repeatedly emphasizes that sharia law can only be considered if one day there is a muslim majority in denmark . 
  `` although there are 250,000 muslims in denmark , we stoned one that has made adultery , or chop the hand of someone who has stolen , for there to be a head of state and a legal system that traps judgment . '', 
  do you think that there should be capital punishment in denmark ? 
  `` you can not put it bluntly , there are many things that must come first . 
  there must be a muslim society and an islamic state . 
  every country in the world has a criminal , and physical punishment is part of the law of islam . 
  but you can not be saying that we have to have physical punishment in denmark , denmark is not a muslim society , `` says radwan mansour . 
  he is generally believed that danish criminal law in several areas have something to learn from the qur ` an . 
  `` people who make trouble and crime and meetings in court , is almost forgiven . 
  i think that the punishment should be a little harder for them , `` he says . 
  free friday radwan mansour also believe that there is much to learn from the qur ` an , when it comes to construction of work life . 
  as imam , he meets many muslims who work friday . 
  13 when friday prayers begins , and therefore they must either calling in sick to work or be away and ask for forgiveness . 
  `` in the friday prayer is obligatory for men of 16-17 years to come in the mosque . 
  so the law may need to be relaxed so that people can get free a few hours on friday afternoon , `` he says . 
  inland 10/18/2015 prime minister lars l\u00f8kke rasmussen ( v ) and df-chairman dahl to struggle mightily at all to get over the threshold , if it were up to the muslims in denmark . 
  photo : stine bidstrup muslims will send loop and thulesen down towards the threshold prime minister lars l\u00f8kke rasmussen ( v ) and df-chairman dahl would be in danger of slipping out of parliament , if it were up to the danish muslims . 
  to 4 of 10 muslims want the koran to be included as a foundation for legislation , is a good argument to halt muslim immigration to denmark , says danish people 's party . 
  `` it is extremely flippant '' `` i hope people with this can see that the number of muslims in denmark is a problem . 
  when you believe the koran must play a crucial role for the law and for society , and when you believe - as previous polls have shown - that women of a certain age should be covered so that they do not want to become part of danish society and one delude themselves into thinking that you can afford to behave as if they were here first and that it is us who have come afterwards . 
  it is extremely flippant , `` says integration spokesman martin henriksen ( df ) .
