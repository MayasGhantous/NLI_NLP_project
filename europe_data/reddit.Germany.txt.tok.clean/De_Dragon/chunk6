  you 're not paying for content that costs money to produce . 
  it is the exact same thing . 
  many ads are based on views instead of clicks . 
  practically all video ads are like that . 
  are you saying you do n't want online news websites to exist ? 
  i do n't know what you want . 
  this is what they require you to pay before viewing content that costs money to produce . 
  it should not be an option to view something without paying . 
  do you also steal items from convenience stores ? 
  i also wonder how the ads looked like were no one to use adblock .

  give me a list of your most visited websites . 
  i 'll give you 5 minutes so you ca n't search for some obtrusive ones . 
  do n't even try to pretend that your ` browsing experience is impaired ' for every website you visit . 
  the only websites i can think of for that are youtube channels you do n't support and do n't want to view the ads for . 
  that is suboptimal , indeed . 
  i just meant in general . 
  not true . 
  you need it to be true , though . 
  yeah , one or two . 
  the ethical thing to do is to allow the ads to appear in exchange for viewing their website . 
  i meant ethically . 
  you can do it , but do n't pretend you 're not a douche for doing it . 
  some websites are run almost entirely on ad revenue . 
  i do n't understand . 
  why are you allowed to use an adblocker ? 
  most ads you see on news websites are unobtrusive . 
  you saved me from sudden death . 
  here 's the same happening in germany and france : germany : http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/survey-turks-in-germany-willing-to-integrate-but-more-religious-a-850607.html france : http://www.meforum.org/337/islam-in-france-the-french-way-of-life-is-in, 
  that would save my ass . 
  do you have a source ? 
  the * entirety * of neuk\u00f6lln is hardly a no-go zone considering its population is like 300k . 
  i have only been discriminated against by individuals of middle eastern origin . 
  the slavs are nice . 
  that 's my experience . 
  lucky you , i had to stay there for 3 months as part of my job . 
  would not recommend . 
  in berlin it 's neuk\u00f6lln . 
  only way to find out is to go by yourself at night , because nobody will report on it . 
  perhaps something was lost in translation , but  the poll is the younger muslims who emerges as the most religious . 
  from the article . 
  supporters of isis ? 
  there are n't that many in germany but they do exist . 
  no one talks about them , and when someone does , the cultural identity of the zones is not mentioned .

  some things i 've gathered from the interweb :  pharmacies will have protection against competition  isps are liable for our shit  privatization of copyright infringement institutions is this correct ? 
  what else is there ? 
  question , how do you resubmit this if it has already been submitted ? 
  can you ** please ** stop calling people racist ? 
  it 's not either ` accept every single individual into your home ' and then ` nazi racist . ', 
  there 's a line there in between called common fucking sense .

  i do this all the time when i visit british subs ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kappa, 
  you can say more than one thing . 
  i know the numbers are n't trustworthy . 
  i 'm asserting it with skewed data with an extremely large difference between two groups . 
  now i ask you a simple question - did the study just happen to pick convervative regions , and did the study just happen to re-poll ( because of no response ) a very conservative population ? 
  if your answer is yes , then you will need a source , because the most likely scenario is that a statistical sample represents the average . 
  okay , but my point stands . 
  we need a source for that . 
  it 's more likely that a statistical sample represents the average muslim . 
  what the f ? 
  yes it does , it requires the assumption that the study just happened to pick the most conservative regions . 
  refer to [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3o3jcb/islam_primary_religion_in_brussels_in_twenty_years/cvtw5od ) where that is sorted out . 
  i assume that , when the sample is large enough , that muslims on average hold the same values . 
  you 're saying that , because of selection bias , the study just happened to pick the most conservative regions . 
  i feel the same . 
  the numbers are n't trustworthy because of regional selection , but to say that you just happened to pick the most conversative regions is an additional assumption , and must be proven . 
  the * numbers * are n't relevant , and i would never pretend they are . 
  but like i said , the difference is . 
  i guess my weakness is that i do n't have a sturdy stance . 
  i will shift my opinions when i see data to the contrary . 
  if you want to state that the regions selected were so wildly more conservative as to eliminate the difference , then please provide a source , as per occam 's razor . 
  then it appears that the most likely scenario - that muslims answer polls accurately like other groups , is the one we 're going with . 
  well i was n't thinking about that sort of thing !, 
   i just mean to for example help syrians in turkey by donating * massive * amounts of money to them , and keep the original dudes of europe in the majority . 
  i believe that might be skewed . 
  mohammed is so wildly more popular than other muslim names that practically every child with muslim parents is named mohammed . 
  the * difference * is representative . 
  i 'll need a source on the selected regions being so much more conservative , by occam 's razor . 
  i 'll need a source all i can think of in this context what ` german ' means is nazism . 
  please respond to my other point . 
  if you can not do that , then i thank you for your time . 
  the difference is now `` scary numbers to wave for ideological purposes '' because you do n't like it ? 
  hell i do n't like it either . 
  i was fucking shocked when i saw this , as a centrist . 
   because that is what is expected of a ` muslim ' . 
  and because they have no other identity than ` muslim ' , they will . 
  source ? 
   says the german ... what ? 
   interestingly , it did n't . 
  i proved that wrong in another response . 
  it reached * many * , then . 
  does n't affect my point . 
   but back to my previous argument . 
  you ca n't in any way say that the presence of islamic politicians in the belgian political system means that fundamentalist islamic values are being introduced .
