i 'm also 17 years old , and i was born and raised in germany as well . 
  i do n't have the german citizenship ( yet , it was requested 2 years ago ) and my heritage is russian . 
  to be honest , i consider myself more german than russian , probably because i do n't have that much that connects me with russia , except of my ancestry and my mother language ( which i 'm not even completely fluent in , either ) . 
  as another one said , frankfurt has actually the biggest crime rate in germany . 
  look at it as an exception , many other cities are much nicer . 
  not that impressive , but , eh . 
  i 'm sorry for shit quality . 
  i got austrian . 
  my closest soulmates are belgium and germany . 
  i am german . 
  well , i apologize for those bad experience you had to make . 
  that people might ask you about ancestry seems odd to foreigners but is relatively common here . 
  that coca-cola girl was certainly a bitch and represents a small minority . 
  i 'm living in the far north of bavaria , so perhabs things are a bit different down there . 
  i do n't say racism is an issue in here , i 'm just saying it is not as huge and not as common as the original comment might imply . 
  i do n't really look russian . 
  in fact , i am often told i look turkish . 
  still no racism , even if some comments like `` where are you from '' might sound a little bit racist . 
  usually it 's just curiousity . 
  have you ever been in bavaria ? 
  i 've been living in bavaria for 13 years , as a russian , and i ca n't speak of a single case of racism towards me or my family . 
  just look at the title of the post . 
  well then , what is the general definition of a dialect ? 
  is it the lexical difference of = < 25 % ? 
   languages with a difference that 's less than 25 % can be considered dialects . 
  there 's a difference of 25 % or less between german and dutch , but i would n't count dutch as a dialect of german ( or vice versa ) . 
  `` moral-land '' i 'm okay with this . 
  most police ( wo ) men i 've met in bavaria are also pretty relaxed . 
  i am german and i do not find this funny . 
  i think it 's delicious . . 
  they still cost 2,80 to 3,50 here, 
  it 's interesting for people with an interest in languages and linguistics . 
  like me . 
  i know , i just listed a few examples to keep it short . 
  yeah , i knew about warsaw but then remembered that i must not give poland any relevance . 
  just kidding , i only listed a few examples to keep it short . 
  i was in frankfurt once and had a great view on its skyscrapers . 
  unfortunately only from below , though . 
  i agree with you . 
  i do n't like this mish-mash of modern and traditional either . 
  i 've heard something about how it would be very difficult to build a lot of skyscrapers in berlin , because of its relatively soft soil . 
  not sure if it 's true . 
  those would be corescrapers , though . 
  [ la d\u00e9fense ] ( http://www.melia.com/en/hotels/france/paris/melia-paris-la-defense/img/meliaparisladefense-carrusel1.jpg ) does something like this . 
  it is a major business district - dominated by skyscrapers - within the paris metropolitan area , and lies just outside of paris itself . 
  yeah , a city plastered with skyscrapers would n't be very appealing to me either , but on the other hand only a handful of skyscrapers in a huge city would look a wee bit out of place . 
  in most big cities - especially in the usa - only a few regions exhibit densely-built skyscrapers , which seems like a good compromise to me . 
  rural bavarian who 's been living here for 15 years here . 
  send help . 
  ( preferably in the form of an interpreter ), 
  it 's just that nobody would complain about it anymore ( or not as much , at least ) , because it would be officially approved . 
  i did n't even realize how german i 'm acting ... 
  maybe they are trying to embrace european diversity . 
  i actually do n't mind it , but i 'd rather see it be restricted to a special day every month , where everybody were allowed to participate . 
  well , this is a new one . 
  neither did he directly critize anyone with his comment , nor is `` islamophobe '' a meaningless term . 
  altruism is a thing . 
  yes . 
  i think i will avoid comment threads regarding immigration and fugitives from now on completely . 
  i think it is an established fact that just about every religion can be interpreted differently and/or contains aspects that are irreconcilable with a modern society . 
  i would argue it is a certain fact as well , that many comments here should n't be what / r/europe stands for . 
  yes , a lot of these comments can be traced back to brigading , but there is no doubt that some of them stem from `` regular '' / r/europe users . 
  / r/europe in general is fine , but the threads about fugitives often contain a lot of depraved shit . 
  i 've seen comments here straight up demanding they be shot or put into camps . 
  but i am, 
  the comments here are horrible . 
  yeah , and those countries are truly * prime * examples , whose principles we all should adhere to . 
  right ? 
  i have yet to see anyone walk around with a dirndl/lederhose outside of traditional events . 
   that 's limited to the southern part of germany . 
   not really true as well . 
  i really dig skyscraper-skylines :|, 
  c1 might be a good bet , but as i said , i 'm not sure . 
  try to write something in german . 
  maybe i can give you a candid , yet unprofessional evaluation . 
  how so ? 
  holy shit , you speak german , english and french on a native level ? 
  how does german sound badass ? 
  i 'm not contesting it , just curious . 
  are n't serbian , bosnian , montenegrin and kroatian basically a single pluricentric language ? 
  i heard that 's called the `` deppenapostroph '' = `` the moron 's apostrophe '', 
  well . 
  i guess you could even start to call yourself an * advanced * german speaker , because your comment actually looked very nice , save for a few minor errors , like mixed up genders , etc. 
  huh . 
  we have * denglish * , but it describes the use of many anglicisms in german instead of applying german grammar or the likes to english , though it certainly exists . 
  dunglish ? 
  is it a mix between dutch and english ? 
  - german - russian - english - learning dutch after dutch maybe spanish/french or improving my russian . 
  if we keep it within english writing , it would be `` kvelle '' , `` kvaste '' and `` kvaak '' . 
  a german would write it `` kwelle '' , `` kwaste '' and `` kwaak '' , because the german ` w ' is an english ` v ' . 
  i hope you 're aware of this distinction . 
  now that i 'm saying it loudly , it does sound like an nrw-accent . 
  interesting , i 've never heard that some germans do pronounce it like / kw / . 
  where exactly are you from ? 
  i have never heard it pronounced like that . 
  what is so complicated about the icelandic ` g ' ? 
  *** you ^ take ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ back ***, 
  a fellow asuka-fan in the wild !, 
  would have been less if i had n't forgotten what on earth bulgaria is for a few seconds . 
  i have literally never met a creationist .
