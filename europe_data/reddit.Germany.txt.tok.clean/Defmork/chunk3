  happy birthday !, 
  interesting . 
  we 've never liked you anyway , hmpf . 
  ^ ^ but ^ ^ we ^ ^ actually ^ ^ do ^ ^ :(, 
  i feel inadequate . 
  an attempt to bring out the multi-cultural side of europe . 
  there are only few european cities with a significant number of high-rise buildings and skyscrapers ( such as frankfurt , moscow , london and paris ) , however i would n't mind more of them at all , as i find them very aesthetically pleasing . 
  of course i value the traditional skylines consisting of older , historical buildings as well , but i like modern skylines more . 
   austria  schnitzel with tunke http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/993/875/084.png, 
  apparently the uk is part of the aldi s\u00fcd area . 
  though it should be noted that i 'm not certain whether the differences between s\u00fcd and nord carry over to subsidiaries in other countries . 
  i love brittany now . 
  definitely . 
  aldi s\u00fcd is usually cleaner , prettier , and has a better ( or at least more thoroughly sorted ) selection than aldi nord . 
  nope , jewish . 
  my parents came from the asian part of russia , so i guess this counts ? 
  they emigrated to germany due to the better labour market and general instability in russia in the 90s . 
  now that i 've thought about it , i ca n't really fully explain that notion of mine . 
  i think it mostly boils down to the fact that austria does n't have as many destitute , impoverished , or just generally dreary cities like germany does ( berlin , bremen , ruhr area , big chunks of eastern germany ) . 
  moreover , some professions seem to be able to get higher wages in austria than in germany . 
  gdp per capita in germany and austria are almost equal , yet austria does seem wealthier in some aspects . 
  since they learnt russian instead of english in schools . 
  though english education is still abysmal in some regions ( even in western germany ) . 
  widespread dubbing of english/american media does n't make things better . 
  we 're getting one in frankfurt this autumn . 
  i 'm really hyped , i 've heard lots of good things about it . 
  of course it is , i do n't want to sugarcoat . 
  i just do n't think that it warrants the level of caution your friend displays . 
  which is a country of 82 million people . 
  3 attacks a day are quickly overshadowed by more probable incidents like traffic accidents . 
  i 'm hyped for the prospective [ tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fehmarn_belt_fixed_link ) between germany and denmark . 
  should reduce the travel time between denmark and the rest of mainland europe dramatically . 
  is ... is that a waffle ? 
  bread 's usually thicker and fluffier , and the stuffing looks a bit dry without much sauce , but aside from that it is far from the worst d\u00f6ner i 've seen . 
  he 's just special . 
  never heard of it in both upper and lower franconia ... 
  ** penis !, 
  you 're 3cm taller than me , both of you are on my enemy list . 
  nothing irrational about being a vegetarian as long as you consume all the nutrients you need . 
  there are more turks in duisburg than in frankfurt ( even though the latter has decisively more inhabitants ) so he does have a point . 
  my cousin lives in sri lanka for a few months every year . 
  some relatives of mine live in russia , and most of my relatives on my mother 's side live in israel . 
  i 'm sorry , but we do seem to disagree here . 
  is breastfeeding considered a sexual act then ? 
  when my mother told my kindergarten teacher back in nrw that we were moving to bavaria , she kindly asked `` is this supposed to be a punishment ? '', 
  jokes on her , bavaria 's great . 
  i wish english were more widespread in germany . 
  at least on par with the netherlands or scandinavia . 
  absolutely . 
  why would n't it be ? 
  reading through / top/all is quite enjoyable indeed . 
  but the vitriol in the comment sections and the fact that the smallest blunders are immediately posted there sour my opinion of it greatly . 
  / r/sas is a cancer of a subreddit . 
  / r/askeurope is way better . 
  what these two subreddits , and a couple others like / r/askanamerican have in common is that they 1 : do n't actually manage to accurately represent the entity they represent on reddit 2 : tend to turn into somewhat of a bubble from time to time . 
  also '' \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442 '' , which means `` writing '' or `` font '' . 
  half of my extended family lives there , and i 'm ethnically jewish . 
  i 've also been there a couple times , and it is a very nice country . 
  you certainly get a point for creativity . 
  a scandinavian in favour of further eu federalisation . 
  now i 've seen it all . 
  problem is that most refugees do n't even stay in eastern europe . 
  many of them keep going to germany and sweden . 
  * ooh , heaven is a place on earth *, 
  how could things be better ? 
  not everybody is swabian , buddy, 
  i 'm relieved that this is the case , then . 
  not sure where i picked it up , must 've been a comment somewhere on reddit . 
  i notice that very few germans speak ill of the french , aside from the usual jabs and jokes . 
  although i heard there 's still some anti-german sentiment in alsace-lorraine ? 
  * my hand is in warm water * . 
  same meaning in afrikaans and english . 
  i definitely remember having been taught about indigo as well . 
  ya i 've had both of those very often during my ( russian ) childhood , that 's why . 
  hash browns and pilaf are what i immediately associate russia with , disregarding the fact that other countries have these dishes too . 
  i do n't like sauerkraut either . 
  inb4 i have to hand in my citizenship, 
  oh yeah same as here , meant to write ` ts ', 
  a few things i can think of : - < c  as ` ts ' before ` i ' and ` e ' and as ` k ' everywhere else - < ae  and < oe  as ' \u00e4 ' and ' \u00f6 ' respectively - < qu  as ` kv ', 
  i 've heard both in franconian . 
  best of both worlds , so to speak . 
  yeah , there 's the past perfect progressive , past perfect , present perfect progressive , present perfect , past progressive , simple past , present progressive , simple present , going-to future , and will-future . 
  the definitions are more or less clear , however there are lots of exceptions and regional differences in usage of different tenses , so it took me a long time to be comfortable with my choice of tense for any given situation ( albeit still not perfect ) . 
  my father 's attempting to learn english and he has issues with the tenses , however i often struggle with explaining when to use what and why , just because i had to `` internalise '' it . 
  hmm , i was going by this [ link ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/homo-ehe-cdu-nein-in-berlin-erspart-angela-merkel-neue-debatte-a-1045233.html ) ( sorry for the german ) . 
  it 's probably outdated , or some members merely voted along party lines , and not their own personal views . 
  i suppose that the reason for the cdu not officially supporting homosexual marriage is the csu . 
  yet another ideological division could lead to more internal strife , or even a split . 
  fun fact , i 've met about 5 austrians with whom i have interacted more closely , and they all happened to be from vienna . 
  big ` ol meanie :p, 
  it does n't mention anything about whether the muslims questioned were all liberals ) . 
  so if we assume that 60 % of all german muslims support homosexual marriage ( which indeed is a lower number than you might be used to in the netherlands ) , it means that german muslims are more liberal than the ruling cdu/csu party . 
  evil scientists . 
  can confirm , we had a grand time in chalkidiki . 
  we were near a village called metamorfosi iirc , but i 'm sure that anywhere on that peninsula is a good place . 
  rarely to sometimes . 
  a girl in my school grade wore one , and as i currently live in a big city i sometimes see people wearing a hijab . 
  usually older women , though . 
  correct . 
  sri lanka , because i have family there that could help me get settled .
