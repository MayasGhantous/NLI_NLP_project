  it is not unheard of . 
  helmut kohl was the chancellor of germany for 16 years . 
  the office of chancellor does n't have a term limit ( unlike the president ) , however the chancellor can be removed from office by means of a constructive vote of no confidence ( which has been attempted twice and succeeded once thus far ) . 
  also german . 
  he said small , not tiny . 
  the swiss or the netherlands . 
  i see you also use duolingo . 
  not exactly , it 's more like the  a < in english `` car '' , or the british pronunciation of `` bath '' . 
  the  r < is rolled with the tongue , the  a < is pronounced way back in the mouth . 
  mama always said berlin is like a box of chocolate . 
  you never know what you 're gon na get . 
  = is n't it ? 
  `` weather is shite today , innit ? '', 
  german has the same word for `` door lock '' and `` castle '' . 
  as does russian . 
  not a lot of it . 
  if i did n't live right next to the thuringian border i could truthfully say that i have been less often in former east germany than in italy . 
  as for the rest , i 've travelled extensively in bavaria and nrw , as well as a couple cities in bw , rlp , and hesse . 
  i myself have a contract where i pay 16 $ / month for 50/10 during the first year , and 32 $ / month during all consecutive years . 
  in addition to this , there are many ways in which one can be left . 
  economically , socially , in foreign affairs , etc. 
  i 'm a ( moderate ) leftist myself , and i also have a distaste for those far-left lunatics that paint an alternate picture of reality , those that many seem to call `` sjws '' . 
  not sure why this is being downvoted . 
  edit : it was at -1 when i commented . 
  of course , but i think wiener schnitzel is heavily implied in this case . 
  i 've never seen anyone eat schnitzel with any sort of sauce , fwiw . 
  love it . 
  i 'm getting the feeling that you 're not being entirely sincere . 
  keep fighting the good fight , brother . 
  any reason why you wrote `` mitteleuropa '' , in german , and not `` central europe '' ? 
  hah , replace swabia with franconia and you 've got my regional allegiance down to a t. also , we call 'em `` sauprei\u00dfn '' around here . 
  100k + city in franconia here . 
  lots of german tourists , but also a couple french ( wo ) men , americans , and lots and lots of chinese and japanese tourists . 
  we have a similar joke ( iirc with a german , two nationalities of your choice , and a turk ) but the german throwing the turk out of the window is only implied , as the turk turns to the german and says `` do n't get any ideas '' . 
  of course the iraqis like what the fuck is this stupid ass question, 
  germans fucking love scotland ( ireland too , by the way ) . 
  what in tarnation, 
  yes . 
  only the swabians do that . 
  what was the problem in the * usa ? 
  does n't the dialect spoken in vorarlberg sound a lot like swiss german ? 
  sure , nuclear weapons prevent lunatics from invading other countries with no retribution , but the eu has made war between its member nations * impossible * by interlocking european economies to such a degree that attacking other countries would mean attacking yourself . 
   as i 've said before , the day that the eu collapses i will be celebrating on the streets with plenty of other people . 
  not cool . 
  judging by the fact that he mentioned education being a state matter i would say germany . 
  ( o.o ), 
   than this ugly and artificial standard german shit ** triggered **, 
  no flags in my `` parts '' either , the parts being franconia . 
  sorry , i meant to say that many germans suck at pronouncing french words the correct way , and i was trying to transcribe the way they mangle them . 
  some people mangle the french pronunciations of these words . 
  `` engagement '' = `` angaschmong '' `` chance '' = `` schongs '' `` refrain '' = `` refreng '' `` restaurant '' = `` r\u00e4storong '', 
  so everybody in austria uses `` sackerl '' rather than `` t\u00fcte '' ? 
  i ca n't roll my r 's , so it 'd come out as `` sackel '' in my case . 
  polish , german , and latin have a common ancestor , but neither is derived from another . 
  [ here ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cb/12/c7/cb12c736b7a0224b2bd74a2504643bc7.jpg ) is a rough overview of the relationships between languages originating from pie . 
  the main languages not derived from pie but present in europe nonetheless are maltese ( semitic ) , turkish ( turkic ) , the finno-ugric languages ( uralic ) , and basque ( isolate ) . 
  well ... 
  i have never seen this in my life . 
  i meant pro-federal , at least that 's the impression i 've been getting . 
  yes , but note that this subreddit is heavily skewed towards eurofederalism and as such is n't representative of the general population . 
  we do n't like the older generation either . 
  the reason why csu is so popular even among younger bavarians is that the alternatives do n't seem to be too appealing on a regional level , and that the csu is doing a very good job at running the state . 
  skyscrapers are rare outside of frankfurt , and to my knowledge most people prefer it this way . 
  finally another person who prefers british to american english . 
   mordze heh , '' \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430 '' also means `` face '' in russian , but it 's a very rude term . 
  something like `` gob '' or `` kisser '' . 
   faihten this one seems to be clearly derived from german `` feucht '' . 
   cijfer many mathematical terms hail from the arabic language , since the middle east was at the forefront of scientific progress during the middle ages . 
  just like `` tollpatsch '' appears to be a naturally german word on the first glance , but is actually derived from hungarian * `` talpas '' * . 
  sleep tight , sweet prince . 
  they should make a doggerland and a nieuw-doggerland right next to it . 
  it 's a bit like english with its difficulty cranked up to `` insanity '' . 
  [ french hissing ], 
  the social support is definitely there , but i 'd say it is n't a very high priority for most people . 
  the conservative csu/csu ( largest party in our parliament ) is against homosexual marriage , and with the national election coming up this year i 'm not expecting any significant changes to the status quo , seeing as homosexual marriage might push the more conservative voters of the csu/csu even further to the right , the afd . 
  fair enough . 
  if i grew up on a farm , and was retarded , bruges might impress me but i did n't , so it does n't . 
  oh , yeah , definitely . 
  but hey , at least the csu would n't be an eternal roadblock for rest-germany . 
  i 've learned more about estonia from your posts than from any other source . 
  i 'm not surprised to find this . 
  it is known here that spain is socially very advanced , whereas germany as a whole is rather conservative - at least by european standards . 
  switzerland is a lot like germany , with the difference that they 're superior to us in many ways . 
  tfw germany loses 18 % of its economy, 
  i bet the austrians would * love * to become a minority in their own country . 
  although one could argue that bavarians and austrians are more or less the same . 
  i 've been using this one forever but i 've never met anyone who knew it , nor do i remember where i first learnt it . 
  am i secretly austrian ? 
  and only 15 late trains !, 
  everyone is that uncle at a russian gathering , including the women . 
  source : have russian family, 
  14/f/monaco perhaps ? 
  a/s/l ? 
  why do we keep getting these weird-ass questions, 
  munich is supposed to be a nice area , if you can afford their property prices . 
  we do the same in germany . 
  pet pigeon i love pigeons, 
  well , speaking of ridiculous recipe videos , what do you say about [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfxpwbwbnuu ) ? 
  to be honest , i 've never understood the difference in german or english either . 
  also , that is one adorable rabbit .
