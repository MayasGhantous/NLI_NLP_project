  russian : mother tongue , but i 've forgotten ( or never learned ) a lot of it , and now speak it on an intermediate level . 
  using it on a nearly daily basis . 
  german : born and raised in germany , therefore fluent in german . 
  near-daily as well . 
  english : learned it in school , improved upon it by spending time on the internet and consuming media in english . 
  use it on a daily basis online and with my girlfriend . 
  latin : second foreign language i learned in school , grew to dislike it eventually and now i 've pretty much forgotten most of it . 
  dutch : learned a bit of dutch for shits and giggles , fortunately it 's almost like cheating , in regards to syntax and grammar . 
  i could probably manage to uphold a simple conversation in dutch . 
  french : currently trying to pick it up autodidactically , because my dumbass self went for latin in school . 
  wish me luck . 
  post pictures of your zaj\u0105c please, 
  something similar : der schild = the shield das schild = the traffic sign, 
  italy and greece , no contest . 
  i must be ugly af then . 
  / u/prblmbr is mine !, 
  yes, 
  english though . 
  past percect progressive , past perfect , present perfect progressive , present perfect , past progressive , simple past , present progressive , going to-future , will-future , etc. 
  i need more corny croatian dad jokes about slovenia . 
  russia too . 
  my israeli cousin also did n't believe that we have a coastline . 
  seems as though our destiny is being land-locked . 
  bavaria : country edition, 
  i could get behind this . 
  yeah , i do realise that . 
  sadly dubbing is a very profitable business , so i do n't think this will change anytime soon . 
  nope , brought up by russian parents in cologne and bavaria . 
  native : german , russian * fluent : english mediocre : russian * broken : dutch ^ ^ * : ^ ^ was ^ ^ raised ^ ^ bilingually , ^ ^ but ^ ^ unlearned ^ ^ lots ^ ^ of ^ ^ russian, 
  why ca n't we be like you . 
  yeah , that 's correct . 
  german and dutch word orders tend to be very similar , apart from a couple notable exceptions . 
  think he 's just bantering . 
  maybe the impact of the formation of an european bloc of countries on global economics and geopolitics ? 
  a city of roughly 20,000 . 
  the `` prayers every morning '' thing definitely held true for our elementary school back then , though , but we did n't do that stuff in our gymnasium , nor did we have an altar . 
  we were n't * that * extreme . 
  same in bavaria . 
  those piss me the fuck off . 
  i really do n't feel like having to convert the amounts of every goddamn ingredient , especially from volume to weight ( cup -  gram ) . 
  that 's why i stick to recipes in german and british english . 
  the mvp . 
  was about to consult wiktionary myself . 
  lots of words like `` rug '' , `` rag '' , `` mug '' , `` bag '' , `` peg '' , etc. 
  they just sound kind of funny and primitive , albeit in an endearing way . 
   pristine that one due to the similarity to `` pri\u0161tina '' maybe ? 
  australia , new zealand , or canada . 
  perhaps israel , as i have a right on israeli citizenship . 
  i know right ? 
  i certainly do not envy those that have to learn german as a foreign language . 
  wow man , no need to throw around with insults . 
  no chance in hell that german will ever be '' * the * language of the eu '' . 
  an increased level of interlocking between the countries you mentioned , with the german armed forces having integrated part of the dutch navy , the french military about to adapt a german gun as their standard rifle , project kant , etc. 
  can already be observed . 
  way to generalise 80 million people with just three paragraphs . 
  are you sure you are n't german , with that efficiency ? 
  third time 's the charm !, 
  even though many people do n't speak it very well , there is an existing `` infrastructure '' for the acquisition of the english language in just about every country . 
  introducing esperanto as a lingua franca would herald a complete reset , and would be connected with very high costs ( hiring/training esperanto teachers , etc. ) . 
  besides , even though i 'm not an expert i can faintly recall that esperanto mainly draws from romance and germanic languages - which disadvantages speakers of slavic languages just as much as english does . 
  i assume the proliferation of the english language will further increase in future . 
  who knows , maybe there 'll even be some kind of `` euro-english '' . 
  edit : or what / u/jolerigolo said . 
  eventually , in the future . 
  right now we should strive towards the resolution of our current problems and a natural integration of the countries within the eu . 
  i 'm surprised you even know how to use a computer !, 
  `` neuland '' refers to a quote from angela merkel from like a year ago where she says `` das internet ist f\u00fcr uns alle neuland '' - `` the internet is uncharted terrain for all of us '' . 
  it was subject to much ridicule afterwards and still is , but it highlights that there is an intrinsic ignorance and fear of technological progress in the government and the population . 
  the mobile phone network is spotty at best in some rural areas , data volume is way too expensive , the transition from copper cables to glass fibre is going very slowly , almost no public free wifi , almost no google street view coverage , etc. . . and no , we do not have homosexual marriage . 
  we do have homosexual partnerships , but homosexual couples may not `` marry '' in the traditional sense and may not adopt children . 
  that 's actually an issue where the people are more progressive than the government , as the majority of germans support homosexual marriage . 
  thanks for the insight . 
  - legalise homosexual marriage - invest more money in infrastructure and education - federalise the educational system ( which hitherto has been a state matter ) - abandon the current `` neuland '' stance towards all things regarding the internet - abandon the widespread nimby-culture - limit the influx of illegal immigrants and refugees * to an extent *, 
  nuremberg and dresden . 
  different culture , eh ? 
  alright , i pick malta too . 
  i remember your thread on / r/de !, 
  glad you 're liking it here . 
  ah , thought you had a specific issue with the italian-speaking part of switzerland . 
  why not ? 
  i know it was asked here recently , but considering we get different people here all the time i thought it would n't hurt asking the question again . 
  my parents thought the same !, 
  they moved to germany from russia in 1995 . 
  but of course , the 90s were a rough time period and the circumstances entirely different . 
  seeing as i live in bavaria , `` austria '' is almost cheating , so i would probably pick the netherlands , because i have a tiny grasp of the language and would probably acclimatise myself to the country fairly swiftly . 
  prior to brexit , i would have considered the uk as well . 
  apart from that , france and the czech republic would be viable alternatives . 
  how come ? 
   nooooooooo . 
  i 'd rather have german than english . 
  huh ? 
  feeling like such a cockblocker right now . 
  sorry about that bro . 
  checks out . 
  according to wiktionary , it 's been extinct for a couple centuries . 
  sorry , i have never heard of this word . 
  greek food in general is the best . 
  knock at someone 's door and ask whether you may use their faucet . 
  * vomits blood *, 
  i think this is starting to change .
