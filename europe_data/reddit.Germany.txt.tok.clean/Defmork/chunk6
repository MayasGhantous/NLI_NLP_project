  pretty much everyone i know uses print . 
  whither , thither , hither !, 
  seeing as finns have problems with consonant clusters ( or so i 've heard ) , something like `` tschechisches streichholzsch\u00e4chtelchen '' might kill them . 
  i think it is kinda big , but i 've never had a big interest for it . 
  there 's a sub though , / r/germanrap . 
  am child of russians , can confirm . 
  numbers are hard . 
   but mostly through the influence of english people started them using in all sorts of inappropriate places . 
   what is it really like ? 
  you call the doctor 's office and ask for an appointment . 
  you go to the doctor 's place , show your health insurance card , and wait for your turn to be treated ( you can also show up without appointment , but you 'll usually have to wait longer then ) . 
  once the doctor has done the needful , you 're free to go and pick up your insurance card if you have n't already . 
   are long wait times really a thing ? 
  depends on the urgency . 
  if you have a serious injury no , if you only have a slight belly ache or a cold yes . 
   is seeing a specialist any harder or more costly ? 
  if a specialist is necessary the costs are paid for by the insurance , but you might have to wait longer . 
   do people tend to opt for private healthcare and is it worth the extra cost ? 
  in germany you 're free to switch to a private insurance company if you 're self-employed or your wage is above a certain threshold ( as opposed to the obligated public insurance ) . 
  i 'd say * most * people that fulfill one of these conditions do so , but switching back to public might become a hassle afterwards . 
  does n't `` lul '' mean `` penis '' too ? 
  does anyone happen to have any experiences with semesters abroad in prague ? 
  i think i spider !, 
  we also use apple for this one . 
  they pander heavily to russians , and in fact many of them vote for afd . 
  i 'm a german from a post-1990 russian family , and even though we are properly integrated i can confirm all of your observations . 
  well done !, 
  i 'd honestly put it down to 9 , maybe 8.5 . 
  pick-pocketing is common in tourist-heavy places and some bigger cities have shady parts i would n't always recommend entering . 
  but apart from that , pretty damn safe . 
  idk man , canada is pretty damn safe . 
  judging by our news , one might think the usa is a place with 3rd-world shitholes in every urban centre , weekly school shootings , people dying one after another because they ca n't afford their medical bills , and so on . 
  of course , it is usually * heavily * overblown . 
  just like the news you are getting about us . 
  average 1-room apartment for students or for more people ? 
  yep !, 
  lots of trucks from the czech republic , poland , slovakia , and other eastern european countries in my corner of the country . 
  \\ + languages ? 
  i think it 's only a few regions right at the border . 
  plus , a friend of mine up here in upper franconia says `` das nutella '' . 
  the genders of some words even vary by country/region . 
  for example ( and please do correct me if i 'm wrong ) , it 's `` das cola '' and `` das e-mail '' in austria and the very south of germany vs. `` die cola '' and `` die e-mail ' . 
  it 's always interesting to hear how people pronounce `` thriller '' . 
  is it going to be `` thriller '' , `` friller '' , `` triller '' , or `` sriller '' ? 
  umm , about 30-50 $ for a blowjob according to google . 
  my classmates and i also had fun , but it was * really * shady . 
  a prostitute of ... questionable appearance offering me a blowjob for 20 $ and some guy offering me lsd are just two instances of aforementioned shadiness i can recall . 
  wait ... other people do n't dig holes in beaches ? 
  munich , but it 's rather expensive and flats are hard to come by . 
  also i guess because / r/de is n't a default sub for germans , iirc . 
  / r/de , while officially representing the entire dach region , is essentially a subreddit for germany . 
  it 's gotten fairly active recently , the number of dumbuts is surprisingly low , and our memes are approaching / r/sweden standard . 
  / r/germany is mostly a subreddit for expats and aspiring expats in germany . 
  same here . 
  i do n't like alcohol too much and i 'm german * and * russian . 
  although my being a lazy sack of dog shit can be sufficiently explained by the latter . 
  it 's certainly the centre of the eurozone , hehe . 
  hmmm . 
  frankfurt is said to be `` badville '' in the sense of being a soulless banking city with drug trafficking . ^ 1 the cities in the ruhrgebiet are said to have lots of unemployment . 
  dresden is said to be a hotspot for racists . 
  single neighbourhoods that have a big immigrant population and a bad reputation , like bonn-bad godesberg , duisburg-marxloh , and berlin-kreuzberg . 
  however , after giving it some thought i do n't think we have * the one * city that is the absolute worst , which is nice . 
  ^ 1 ^ does n't ^ reflect ^ my ^ own ^ opinion . 
  ^ i ^ think ^ it 's ^ beautiful . 
  i moved 150 km away and have my own little flat in a cheap part of the city . 
  i travel back by train every friday to visit my family , and go back on sunday . 
  various sorts of fruit juices , yeah , forgot about that . 
  multivitaminsaft ftw !, 
  do n't like yogurt , but i can confirm the quality of our br\u00f6tchens . 
  lots of bread with assorted cold cuts , jam , butter/margarine , nutella , honey , cheese , boiled eggs . 
  usually a box of cornflakes as well . 
  typical beverages are tea or coffee ( depends on the person ) , milk , or hot chocolate . 
  ^ ^ damnit , ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ hungry ^ ^ now . 
  literally just opened the wikipedia article myself . 
  i 'm a bit surprised about switzerland being classified as central european as well . 
  i thought it was widely regarded to be firmly western europe . 
  i 've always been confused by the term `` central europe '' . 
  i used to think that `` central europe '' consists of germany , austria , poland , czech republic and perhaps hungary . 
  now it seems a bit like v4 + austria . 
  what do you think ? 
  kids do trick-or-treating and people might organise halloween-themed private parties , but i do n't think we do anything beyond that to celebrate it . 
  to answer your question directly , iirc the most gay-friendly countries in western europe are the nordic countries , the netherlands , spain , uk , france , etc. 
  germany is certainly way up there as well , but sadly we have n't legalised same-sex marriage yet . 
  overarchingly i 'd say that you 'll have a similar experience anywhere in we , especially if you stick to the cities . 
  some people are prejudicer against bulgarians and romanians , even though the situation is improving ( as arabs and turks are assuming a negative reputation ) . 
  my own city harbours a sizeable romanian diaspora , and people do n't seem to have a problem with that . 
  okay . 
  this graph essentially confirms what i said . 
  so , if op is willing to move to china , india , or africa and get used to their drastically different culture , because those places are likely going to be highly prosperous soon : great !, 
  but he just as well might move to a place that is already offering a high standard of living ( and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future ) , with a culture and language closer to his own and a good track record regarding tolerance - as long as it floats his boat . 
  as for the second question - still waiting for an answer . 
  i did find [ this chart ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/b3/share_of_world_gdp%2c_2004_and_2014.png ) . 
  which does n't say that europe 's gdp is declining ( it is actually currently undergoing a period of growth ) , but that it 's influence on the global economy is waning . 
  which makes sense , since the rest of the world is steadily catching up . 
  nor do i understand how western europe is supposed to be culturally declining , due to the influx of 1-2 million `` afghani/pakistani '' refugees ? 
  how is western europe a sinking ship ? 
  german 2 . 
  european 3 . 
  franconian, 
  oh my fucking god yes .
