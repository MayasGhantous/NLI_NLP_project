  no wonder that there is no progress and they are unable to learn . 
  it looks like it 's even prohibited . 
  if `` their '' people have russian passports than the next border to russia is not so far away so they can leave the donbass region . 
  so no need to send the red army . 
  elseif `` their '' people have ukrainian passports than its simply ** not ** russian business . 
  it 's a case for the un or local authorities . 
  else russia is trying to legalize a war in foreign lands . 
  that the usa had done the same do n't makes either one right . 
  and that you do n't have a problem that someone is bringing war to foregin lands reveals you . 
  looks like a austrian colony flag with serbian royalty seal to me . 
  maybe good old days or something like that ? 
  you are wrong , * implifying you dont try to confuse people * . 
  [ proof ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/r-special-report-russian-fighters-caught-in-ukraine-cast-adrift-by-moscow-2015-5?ir=t ) , you can find more if you want to . 
  some idolize justin bieber or madonna others putin or merkel . 
  if you try to heard sharks like you do cows , numbers will shift dramaticly . 
  dresden had a three day long unification party . 
  speeches , live music , beer , events and so on . 
  just close your eyes and think of england . 
   now , it is a family of immigrants . 
  ok , you pretend to ignore whats already happened and could be entirely avoided . 
  and just because the vicims dont stand in front of you , showing that they are vicims and that there are many of them , you marginalize their suffering . 
  and you also ignore that most of these migrants are men and not familys and that there are extremists and a lot of their supporters among them . 
  now i will shut my mounth and let you fight your ` good fight ' for these ` poor ' people . 
  do n't let reality bother you . 
   europeans of reddit , what is the one stereotype about your country that you hate the most ? 
  w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk !, 
  more walking is better for your health . 
  and if you switch to a bicycle its propably possible to skip bus entirely . 
   why would the antifa dresden claim responsibility but deny it on twitter ? 
  first comes to mind that antifas are nutjobs . 
  just like all extremists . 
  * edit : second is that antifa is not a homogeneous group . 
  as i see it they are focused on one group and list only them . 
  i 'm sure there are websites out there who focus on christians , buddhists , leftists , rightists or any other major group . 
  and as far as i see it the data is complete and correct . 
  if you find flaws at the data , contact the admins . 
  was trying to point on something , just like a neon-sign do it , so my words were a bit over the top , i apologize . 
  [ for the ] ( http://www.thereligionofpeace.com ) [ interested ] ( http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/europe-attacks.aspx ), 
  he is scared , everything you say contribute to the paranoia , let him . 
  just like depression one can self-induct it , its a bit masochistic , but hey as long as it makes him happy and harms nobody else . 
  we germans have a tendency to overdo and keep going for a while until all cools down again . 
  and the actual merkelpolicies and press attitude dont contribute to the cooldown . 
  last time we had a drive the gdr fell apart ( altrough the start of this were in the czech republic ) . 
  * edit : braces *, 
  so a boeing 777 over ukraine is supposed to be a awacs , strategic bomber , ballistic missile or other high-value military equipment , i get it . 
   well libya isnt really stable at all so suggest a better location outside of europe . 
  those nasty boeing 777 's need a proper treatment , is ' t it ? 
  die linke are only outward socialist . 
  but they are the successor of the sed . 
  so in other words they are commies . 
  some of them are fleeing because of the system in iran . 
  but most of them are here because of the monies and benefits . 
  a official authority decided on their claim and rejected it . 
  thus there were no human rights violation involved and they were send back . 
  end of the story . 
  i do not see how and why we need to meddle there further . 
  that some people are not happy with the system they are living in is no reason for asylum . 
  if they are unhappy they should work to change it to the better . 
  even if you dont like it , it stays true . 
  we have the wohle europe to play with our morale supremacy . 
  i would ` nt want that the sharia is enforced here . 
  just because some iranian feel its better than our judical system . 
  and thats what you yourself do , force your world-views on other cultures . 
  if our morale is that better than theirs it will be implented there automaticly . 
  the whole colonial aera is build on such world views . 
  `` we are in the right . 
  this land is now ours . 
  because im better than you . 
  bent over or face the consequences . '', 
  what iranians do with iranian citizens in iran is not our business . 
  the other way around its the same . 
  you get attacked for speaking polish in england . 
  you get attacked for speacking german in poland . 
  hey , the european clusterfuck is raising again . 
  i 'm curious wich pair is next . 
   any developed country i know of ( australia , usa , whatever ) has strict rules for legal immigration . 
  they are very selective and only take those that will benefit their countries with their skills . 
  every sane-driven country does that . 
  ... and polish people commit various violent attacks to innocent people , only to gain backwards ` culture-points ' . 
  oh wait thats not the case or i 'm missing something ? 
  there is a solution and it is really simple and it worked for centuries . 
  until someone decided that its racist or not pc or something like that . 
  just control at the border who is welcomed and who is not . 
  the other european countries just stick to a working solution . 
  look at the closing of the balkan borders , it worked like a charm . 
  the eu-turkey-deal contributed almost nothing to solve this acute problem . 
  it just put erdogan unnecessary in a position of power over our foregin policy . 
  they are running numerous spots all over tv here . 
  they are not the same as the 2011 ones but they have the very same intention and they are as annoying and embrassing . 
  in a quick overview i found only one dot connected to the mongol invasions of east asia and europe . 
  even the suspected source of the map ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_mongol_empire ) ) shows there should be numerous more ` dots ' . 
  so the work done and the idea should be appriciated . 
  but the selected data and the connected intention must be questioned . 
   ** 2008 uefa cup final riots **  http://dbpedia.org/resource/2008_uefa_cup_final_riots  14-05-2008 latitude 53.48083333 longitude -2.23666667 i appriciate the work done for this map !, 
  but the data and selections are bullshit . 
  i bet some duma member jerked off and suddenly found his daughter performing a vid or two . 
   `` trust in democratic institutions was already low , and this will do further damage , '' he told afp . 
  i guess the legislative worked really hard for this image . 
  he went there voluntarily and come back , unharmed . 
  i think that qualifies for ` safe enough to stay ' .
