   in germany they are working without any tests . 
  ukraine should actually do this if * mr. ` i 'm totally no never not lying ' kremlin * accuse them of it . 
  with little green men , on vacation , carrying their weapons and tanks , to play something like a ` referendum ' game . 
  a * berufssoldat * ( regular ) is a soldier for life until s/he retire , its like a vocation . 
  on the other hand a * soldat auf zeit * ( volunteer ) are in service for some years and drop out after that . 
  maximum service time for * saz * are 20 years if i recall correctly . 
   * section 306 * arson  ( 1 ) whosoever sets fire to or by setting fire to them destroys in whole or in part  ...  -5 . 
  ** forests ** , heaths or moors ;  -6 . agricultural , nutrition or forestry facilities or products  belonging to another shall be liable to imprisonment from one to ten years . 
   ...  * section 306c * arson causing death  if the offender through an offence of arson under sections 306 to 306b at least by gross negligence causes the death of another person the penalty shall be imprisonment for life or not less than ten years . 
  but i 'm no lawyer , so i read the laws with common sense in mind . 
  maybe this is wrong for the actual negotiation , as lawyers are trained to read laws in a different way . 
  still too few , compared to the [ behemoths ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/active-military-manpower.asp ) china , usa , india and russia . 
  as [ volunteer ] ( https://www.dienstzeitende.de/blog/dienstzeitverkuerzung-als-saz-128 ) and as [ regular ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sg/__46.html ) there are also ways to quit . 
  obviously if there are mental or physcal issues you can be also set free the one way or the other . 
  * ^ sorry ^ no ^ english ^ scources ^ for ^ the ^ links . 
  dont look up peasant or you will get blindet . 
  how much tax i have to evade for my 2 cents ? 
  yes with 166000 [ active ] ( https://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/poc/bwde?uri=ci%3abw.bwde.streitkraefte.grundlagen.staerke#par2 ) personell , 500 are not that much . 
  article tldr : drama . 
  seriously , do n't fight turkish fights on german streets , go where they belong . 
  if moving is not possible for you , shut up and continue to be a productive member of german society or do whatever you were doing before this incidents . 
  oh and dont call 265 dead in the whole turkey on both sides a massacre , its not . 
   a person died . 
  he might get ** up to ** 10 years . 
  he should get no less than 10 years up to life sentece ( minimum 15 years with parole ) , at least he would get sentenced this in germany . 
  or being the home country of hitler ... * ^ ^ how ^ ^ you ^ ^ like ^ ^ it ? 
  dont fall for it , the cake is a lie !, 
  a throne made out of shawarma , what a hilarious image . 
  for the system it only matters that a number in a database is actually valid . 
  from that time on you only have to be a little lucky that random validation checks dont occour on this number . 
  on the employer side i think its either willfully ignorance or paperwork lazyness . 
  thats why western europe has so low birthrates . 
  bling-bling works in times of ovulation . 
  a shared database of asylum seekers and recent migrants with all information , including pictures and biometrics , would do the trick . 
  maybe to avoid misuse it could be managed by europol or frontex . 
  i dont blame you , not in the slightest . 
  the majority of people are indeed interested in information , if a article caches the interest . 
  its just that people live their lives and they dont have the time and nerves to extract every single news-bit out of the internet . 
  most people just consume news to stay informed and then move on ( and do more important things ) . 
  and its the right way to do so . 
  if you have time to research and proof every news-information you should consider to make this your payed work or you should rearrange your life . 
  besides that , the massmedia in germany lost their credibility slowly over the last years . 
  most of the articles were and are just opinions mixed with some news-bits and not tagged as such . 
  now what should the average joe do in such circumstances ? 
  they ( me included ) choose to belive or just accept the information presented in front of them . 
  at this point i 'm again at my above post . 
   the majority of french people rarely look at non-french speaking media . 
  its the same here in germany too and i guess its also the same for every non-englisch speaking country . 
  i think this new press code will work out for the masses as they mostly just want to be entertained and dont want to research the news information . 
  something something political correctness something media credibility something laugh .

  yes your decision will hurt and already hurts both of us and people here would rather see the uk stay as a full member . 
  the point here is the majority of brits voted against the eu and your government will enforce this outcome and leave . 
  its not our duty to negate the referendum or to force our political view on the british . 
  we can only deal with it in the best possible manner for both of us . 
  i myself dont like the eu how it actually works , how it is enforced and i think a * eeg 2.0 * would be the better form of all that . 
  but i 'm not in charge and will never be and as the eu actually works i can not influence something meaningful . 
  so i have to deal with it just like we have to deal with your brexit decision . 
  the actual incarnation of the eu is build on the free movenment witch includes the free market and all other benefits . 
  its connected so you can not have the one without the latter . 
  you have to go your own way and after that just like all other countries outside the eu you have to negotiate a trade deal or someting like that . 
  thats not ` hardline ' and we dont have to like it , its just how it works . 
  if there are politicans here that are salty about the brexit and express it , it means nothing , its just the usual noise all countries recieve ( see greece , italy and others ) . 
   we are going to leave the eu , they do n't want us , their only reaction has been `` announce article 50 and be double quick about it '' followed by a series of threats . 
  now that we respect * your own * democratic decision that you want to leave , its not ok ? 
  and that we want to quickly resolve that mess * you started * so that both of us can move on , its also not ok ? 
  a nun who managed to escape , witness that the priest fight back as he died . 
  i bet this qualify him as martyr in all abrahamic religions . 
  ^ ( ^ to ^ be ^ clear ^ i 'm ^ atheist ^ myself , ^ so ^ for ^ me ^ he ^ is ^ just ^ a ^ victim . ), 
  i sorry to say that but thats just the usual flak from die linke . 
  whatever they say its just to gain attention and interfere with other patries . 
  die linke have a long term agenda and they already achived one of their big goals once for 40 years . 
  please dont fall for their retorics ( if you are not a strong leftist ) , they dont have a problem to let people suffer for their goals ( like communism ) and worse . 
  i bet my money on : attacker got ( now killed ) wife pregnant . 
  she demanded responsibility from him . 
  but in his fucked up backwards world ( culture ? ), 
  it were not `` honorable '' to marry a `` unpure '' wife . 
  and because womans dont mean nothing to him , he killed her to get his fucking stupid and meaningless culture points back . 
  nah , in the uk nobody needs to have this nasty sex anymore . 
  just give sperm , eggs and money to a scientist and he gives you a ready-to-breed feutus back . 
  whats wrong with frankfurt ? 
  ( just curious , no offence ), 
  yeah , germany gives more than it takes . 
  are n't we generous ? 
  hopefully you are right , but jens stoltenberg already tryed to calm things down on [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/jensstoltenberg/status/754259635205439488?lang=de ) . 
  you know how the bundestag works , they would rather belive him than to do the right actions . 
  time to pull our troops and equipment out of there . 
  i bet , from now on turkey will spin down in full iranian revolution style . 
  german troops shouldnt be there until the inner political rampage and cleansing ends . 
  we also dont have a mandate to play the peacekeepers there . 
  we are only there for missions against isis . 
  well , we are speaking about erdoganistan here . 
  the ` harika ' leader asks and people have to follow . 
  so if he wants a retroactively applied death penalty , he gets it . 
  people have to be extatic about this decision and if not there will be , for sure , some fancy new laws in the future . 
  yes , [ pickled herring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pickled_herring ) , especially the [ soused herring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soused_herring ) variant . 
  edit : surprisingly there is a english wikipedia page for [ fischbr\u00f6tchen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fischbr%c3%b6tchen ), 
   right-wing have very well media and also political influence .
