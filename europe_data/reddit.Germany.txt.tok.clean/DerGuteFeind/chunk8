  its actually only coverage and most of the media are constantly bashing them . 
  far-right here , far-right there , afd sympatisant tells this and that , look how bad they are . 
  its all just in this manner . 
  i remember that claudia roth [ demonstrating ] ( https://www.bayernkurier.de/inland/8411-claudia-roth-auf-abwegen ) with left-wing-antifa-wackos . 
  they are for sure left-wing . 
  you forgot the [ crimes committed by un-soldiers ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/why-are-un-peacekeepers-still-sexually-abusing-children-331343?rm=eu ) and the [ srebrenica massacre ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/07/bosnia-srebenica-united-nations-peacekeeping/398078/ ) . 
  kievan rus colonized the european part of russia . 
  so it existed even before russia were a thing . 
  only the geographical shape were not the same as today . 
  this indeed validates as a actual country . 
  instead of placing a limit our government would rather lower the standard . 
  its this attitude of be the best guy in town at any cost . 
  even if they forget the average joe and even if they slowly turn all standards down . 
  but thankfully because of the brexit , pegida , economists and afd they turn slowly around . 
  you have valid points here but ukraine is all but a artificial state . 
  even if it is closely connected to russia , it has a unique language , history and heritage . 
  besides that the eu can use its immense soft power within ukraine and russia to support it . 
   so exactly what difference does the race or nationality of the assailant make in a rape assault ? 
  police will chase the wrong people . 
  if they find anyone , maybe it is some innocent man that gets his live destroyed . 
  common sense , dont you think ? 
  not only that she protect those `` wonderful people '' that raped her , she also made herself guilty in [ assistance in avoiding prosecution or punishment ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2116 ) . 
  i suspect she is not a isolated case within this part of our society . 
  according to this case , i guess idiocy is not mutually connected with the lack of education , low iq or poverty , its more insularity and naivety that causes it . 
  the good is if she gets wiser she can get more rational and self reflecting . 
  the bad is the damage she causes until she gets to this point as the spokeswoman of a youth movement . 
  i guess probably the russian taxpayer or parents have to pay for the books . 
  either way putin will get richer . 
  deutsche bank is backed by the german federal republic . 
  our government can not let them die . 
  they are just too important . 
  even if they try they can not go down . 
  sultan doing sultan things . 
  username checks out . 
   wtf you talk about ? 
  invading , obviously . 
  this `` hong lei '' basically said , fuck off italy . 
  the best would be to deport the troublemakers and to continue with the inspections . 
  you can be sure that our bureaucrats had calculated and simulated a leave decison . 
  at least its their job and it had been negligently not to . 
  i bet they even have a plan for a case if germany votes leave , even if there would be never such a referendum here . 
   the russians have done it , the chinese have done it , so why the fuck ca n't we do it ? 
  russian and chinese wouldnt use something thats not in their language . 
  if i remember correctly facebook were not the first at these markets to provide this service in native languages . 
  there is also a general mistrust and their governments pushed for native services . 
  on the other hand at least here in germany we had once [ studivz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/studivz ) . 
  it provided the same type of service but were outperformed and outlawed by facebook . 
  and because young germans dont have a problem by using english services and some other [ reasons ] ( https://peopleandmedia.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/facebook-vs-vz-five-reasons-why-facebook-succeeded/ ) . 
  the average joe also dont care enough about privacy or its too cryptic for him . 
  thus they would not switch , not in significant numbers , to a new service . 
  look at whatsapp everybody uses it although there are good and encrypted alternatives and on top of that it belongs now to facebook . 
  exactly . 
  yay !, 
  you carry some irrational loathing with you . 
  but i guess its good to be underestimated for them . 
   why did you choose to ignore my last sentence ? 
  by '' * something * needs to be done '' i had the impression you meant `` police clamp down on it '' . 
  and thats not what i 'm trying to imply . 
  i 'm sorry if i misread it . 
  it could be that we both are trying to say the same . 
   my hope as a british person is that that police clamp down on it and make an example out of a few cases and the problem lessens . 
  people will just shut up again but the attitude will not change . 
  wouldnt it be better to at least try to understand why and try to change it ? 
  saxony has stunning landscapes and sights , long heritage , clever and friendly people , as long as you dont try to force something on them ( which is the whole point about pegida ) . 
  most people i know there dont have anything against immigration till foreingers play along and all in all its not too much . 
  the massive amount of people , the fail of administration , this combined with forced politics from berlin and of course a somewhat stronger patriotism there caused the outrage . 
  unlike other jobs i wouldnt trust a doctor who can not explain me what comes next and why . 
  if its about the health of my relatives or myself i would need to know whats going on and ask questions . 
  realpolitik is a little bit different than what your leaders are telling you . 
  ( its not meant as insult , its just a remainder . ), 
  do we need to send our tanks again ? 
  edit : forgot the / s for sarcasm-challenged . 
   huh , why did he use a blanket gun ? 
  maybe ` suicide by police ' or something like that , some report that he were mentally unstable . 
  it were not illegal , because it seems like the policeman hit him to break his resistance or to prevent him to harm someone with his bicycle or both . 
  i 'm not a lawyer , that tells me common sense . 
  and 28 days later new colonists will arrive . 
  thank you for the quote . 
  almost all parts of europe are somewhat historical relevant to other nations . 
  as you stated k\u00f6nigsberg to germany and poland . 
  crimea to ukraine , russia , mongolia and turkey . 
  this can go on and on . 
  but today , in europe , only russia is arrogant and moronic enough to wage a war and to sacrifice lifes because of such claims . 
  i wonder how long it would take to change russian socitety into more critical thinking or selfreflection . 
   are you a parody of a ridiculously fanatical leftist , or is there a real , living , breathing person with all these opinions ? 
  the sad part is , there are such people here for real . 
  their ideology is somewhat their religion now and we all know how religios nutjobs behave . 
  the good part is , not all of us are like that . 
  there are some of us that like to critical think , dislike ideology of any sort and dont set altruism above sanity . 
  what about ... ism . 
  and again missed the point . 
  and ukraine is not in eu or nato or someting like that , so the ` matters ' dont involve us directly . 
  read [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sanctions_during_the_ukrainian_crisis ) , [ here ] ( http://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/ukrainerussia/ ) and [ here ] ( http://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/special-coverage/eu_sanctions_en ) , you can find more if you want . 
  youre missing the point , what russia denies or not do not matters here . 
  the point is that our politicans want to forget that shitty behavior of russia and sacrifice these smaller countries . 
  just because of money or ideology or whatever they are believing to get out . 
  just recent , russia dont moved 1cm on these issues , they even drop more troops on ukrainian soil . 
  but our forigin minister steinmaier want to loosen the sanctions . 
  and thats only one example of eu politicans acting like this . 
  at this point nobody needs to be conviced that russia invaded ukraine and georgia .
