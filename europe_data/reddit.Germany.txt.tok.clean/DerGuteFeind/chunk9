  our politicans who also know whats going on , propably even more detailed due secret services . 
  it seems to be that to convince them to admit it and to support the invaded countries . 
  but instead , just like steinmaier and others , they are in relativate mode . 
  but isnt starbucks itself a hipster company ? 
  if a brexit is in favor of some questionable parties/people do not matter . 
  the outcome will reflect the opinion of britains voters . 
   well , many of ukrainians now think that after maidan the eu have to fight with corruption among ukrainian politicians . 
  eu is already [ supporting ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-15-5035_de.htm ) them at that . 
  to change a mindset and custom from within can not be done in 1,2 years . 
  look at east europe , its changing . 
  the process is slow , yes , because it needs to be done by people itself and it needs to be sustinable . 
   so far every measurable indicators like gdp/population/hdi are going down . 
  yes , but remember they are fightning a cost intensive war at the east and they lost two areas that were net contributors . 
  this have to be sorted out and on top of that they already are growing again in the first quarters of 2016 . 
  honestly , who cares what isis wants ? 
  you are giving them too much credit , just like our media . 
   life outside of this subreddit on the other hand is completely different , where friendship between poland and germany is genuinely very real . 
  ... and all are singing ' [ kumbaya ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo9ah4vg2wa ) ', 
  visit : hamburg , m\u00fcnchen , dresden ( and [ saxon switzerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saxon_switzerland ) ) avoid : ruhrgebiet ( [ ruhr district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruhr ) ) , berlin , hannover, 
  not long ago they had a healthy opposition and political interested people . 
  remember the gezi park protests ? 
  and now all these people are too scared to talk openly about politics . 
  i 'm not interested in turkey and dont follow news/stories actively , but even i see the change there . 
  nah , we love brits , even if they are divas somtimes . 
   french bread is better than german bread . 
  no , just a plain no !, 
  edit : here are some good listings and explanations : http://germanfoods.org/german-food-facts/german-bread-and-cereals-guide/ http://www.germanfoodguide.com/bread.cfm, 
  china, 
   did that pig fart before being thrown ? 
  thats why it ` learns to fly ' . 
  mechanisms will kick in and all will go to normal in some time . 
  the difference seems to be that russian hools want to harm and english hools just want to fight . 
  i think that makes a big difference . 
  its nothing wrong with a good fight but to intentionally harm someone that lie down and are not able to fight back is just shit . 
  image you were the one on the ground . 
  isnt it now the time for our government to rebuy some of these bond 's ? 
  the price will drop until the yield rises again above zero or do i misunderstand how this works ? 
  turkish butthurt is spreading like aids , maybe they should stop fuckin around . 
  do i wrote that ? 
  not against the wall , but out of our country , if they cant behave civilized . 
   when a group of people gets easily heat up you should treat them differently . 
  just avoid them , most of the time it isnt worth the hassle . 
  she will wait until someone other is doing something . 
  just as she ever do . 
  and after the waiting she will only react , not act . 
  this have noting to do with ` showing who has the biggest balls ' , she just isnt capable or too scared to act . 
  a real leader will act before the situation gets worse , even if the outcome isnt perfect . 
  does not contradict his point . 
  as your fellow german i do not feel guild in either way . 
  what our ancestors did are what our ancestors did . 
  take our history as that what it is , something to learn from . 
  if russia is going after our allies and you dont step up to protect them , nobody would step up to protect you and rightfully so . 
  this is the meaning of a protective alliance . 
  the baltics whould be only the beginning , next could be finland or poland after that central europe . 
  we know how this would end , learn from our history . 
  the good about bulgaria are not the landscapes , the history sites or the beaches , its the traditional [ cuisine ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=bulgarian+cuisine&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiq_z_d6ppnahulsxqkhfcha48qsaqimq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=993 ) . 
  tldr you have not read the article ? 
  i could ` nt care less . 
  edit : to downvoters , how is this news ? 
  he is not elected jet , thus just a regular us citizen going on holiday . 
  there were rumors the events in cologne where partly organized by phone and paper memos . 
  so this is actually a real thing . 
  i 'm even more disgusted bei this behavior of this ` migrants ' . 
  but ... nato is not history , its present ... or do i missed something ? 
  thanks for the reply . 
  i need to be more clear . 
  in my question the people im talking about are those who repost/post their views and get persecuted by the authority . 
  if you dont try , you dont know . 
  it works sometimes and if not you had all the time option two . 
  are these people somewhat related or equal to our central european antifa or are they a different non toxic brand ? 
  as i stated , we know today what fucktards they are . 
  yes , we know that now , but as all the mess begun , there could be a chance talking would have prevent some damage . 
  to solve things you can shoot or talk , i 'd rater talk first and decide if shooting is needed afterwarts . 
  i 'd still be happy with 0.3 % of these 0.6 % . 
  ... and guess who determine what hate speech is ? 
  we all love mondays . 
  cowardism . 
  edit : [ first they came ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_they_came_ ... ), 
  russia moved not 1 cm on the issue . 
  steinmaier feels propably the breath of our export industry on his neck as he bent over . 
  yeah , nothing wrong here , as long as you dont fuck around with the eu because of ` brother russia ' . 
  we germans ever sayed that close ties to russia can be benefiting both sides . 
  the only point who ceep us back to be full bro 's is the russian bullying of smaller neightbors . 
  most of the time they are forced by social pressure within their goups and parallel societies right after they arrive here . 
  this is a complex issue what begins with the refusing to assimilate in our host culture . 
  and it continues to the point where 2nd and 3th generation descendants participate in bombings to kill uninvolved . 
  they do not think that , they want that the average russian belive it is so . 
  this is also the build up of a excuse to bully non-nato neighbors . 
  tl ; dr its the old cold war blame game . 
  ` i 'd rather die than to have dirty windows ! ', 
   get em while they 're young, 
  turkey take them in because they had no choice ( long unguarded land border ) . 
  germany take them in because cheap labor and to put pressure on local labor market , also to play how ` humatarian ' we are . 
  no idea why sweden did it , but be sure there are also underlying interests . 
  politics are always about show , power and money . 
  if a agenda accidentally fits in altruistic ideologies than its easyer to feed it to the masses . 
  there is no such thing like fairness in realpolitik . 
  if you have such impression then the show works for you . 
  mass immigration only stopped because of the winter and the closing of borders in east europe , not because politicans changed . 
  they have to compete .
