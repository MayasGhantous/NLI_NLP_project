not at all forgotten and even called the first world war by some people . 
   no , i sadly do n't think people will leave once syria is safe . 
  the `` i go to germany/sweden or back to syria '' barkers are a good hint of this . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  in the yugoslav wars plenty of refugees arrived as well , around 70-80 % went back , which is the hope now as well . 
  you will also have the means of deportation , once syria is deemed resonably safe again . 
  ( who knows when that 'll be though )  holding your native nation close to your heart and keeping your cultural identity is not an issue . 
  the problem is thinking that your people and nation is above your host nations . 
  huge difference to note here . 
  indeed , as you said , holding your nation and people close at heart , keeping with traditions ( that do not violate laws in the country you live in at the time ) and such , is completely fine and should not be looked down upon as long as it is within reason . 
  however . 
  romanticising is , as you described a mix of arrogance and refusal , a very dangerous mix . 
  and while i 'm the first one to make fun of the `` dats racist tho ! '', 
  left-nutjobs , in this case i have actually never met anyone that believed that criticising people who hold such heavily romanticised views , could be considered racist . 
  that might be true and perhaps i 'm lacking the proper perspective to fix the issue . 
  then again , my view is solely one of an outsider , so you can either agree or disagree . 
  my hope would be that as time passes , these new generations , coupled with continous government efforts , will allow for easier integration and offer a way away from romanticising russia via work and social opportunities . 
  integration is a mix between opportunity and force from the state . 
  you offer the opportunity to integrate , while limiting the ways by which you can avoid it . 
  ( such as being unable to find work if you only speak russian -  people who ca n't work and refuse to take language courses will loose social benefits . 
  as an example . ), 
   you 're comparing arabs in germany to estonians in the ussr ? 
  you 're comparing refugees and immigrants to occupied people ? 
  what ? 
  afaik , he meant that introducing the right measures will integrate more people statistically than now . 
  it is a ridiculous comparison without any backing . 
  fact is that there are efforts to integrate people from all over the world . 
  such a process however takes time and can only support a limited amount of people and are only being established now with the refugee crisis . 
  ( hope is that most will leave once syria becomes safe-ish again . ), 
   partly true . 
  if he implies that it 's a guaranteed integration ; it 's not . 
  if he implies that it 's statistically much likelier to integrate ; he 's right . 
  it 's common sense . 
  indeed . 
  there will allways be those who refuse to integrate and prefer to romanticise the country they rather identifiy with . 
  ( in germany it 's turkey with many turkish people , ignoring all the issues there ), 
  amazing comparison . 
  i too like to compare kiwis with bananas . 
  if the country makes no efforts to assimilate and integrate them then yes , it 's unlikely that they will . 
  if these efforts exist then they definitly will , no matter the propaganda or internet access . 
  hahahahahaha . 
  yes , please . 
  go ahead and see how well that goes for ya, 
  except that it was n't particularly funny in any way . 
  you have voted for an eu representative , every eu member does . 
  he/she in turn voted for or against cecilla malmstr\u00f6m . 
  whether you are happy or unhappy with the result does not matter , that 's democracy . 
  right , you did not . 
  your representatives that you votes for did that . 
  so a precaution because the belgian government messed up with their controls and safety measures means nuclear power is not safe ? 
  really ? 
  source for that claim , google does n't seem to back you up . 
  germany is completely safe in terms of nuclear energy . 
  all it needs is some proper checks by the government, 
  `` the gr\u00fcne wende is here !, 
  we will decommission nuclear power and revert back to brown coal !, 
  such sick advancement ! '', 
  holy fuck, 
  living in berlin we have turkish , armenian , russian , italian and dozens of other gangs/mobs . 
  did i mention biker clubs ? 
  next time you see a smaller female police officer , give it a try !, 
  i 'm sure you would win and not get your ass beat, 
  pretty bad laws - the issue is that in most countries the taxi groups hold quite a bit of political influence . 
  in my city , berlin , they want uber completely banned so that they can keep their ridiculous prices . 
  ( not awful but not great either ), 
  are you retarded ? 
  receiving those benefits is part of being born in that country . 
  you move to germany and work -  awesome , have all the social benefits . 
  you move to germany to leech off the system -  you ( hopefully ) wo n't get shit . 
  if you work you are entitled to all the same benefits as anyone else . 
  it 's only if you move to germany to leech off the system that you will get less . 
  where do you think akp gets its votes ? 
  certainly not from the city but from most of rural and eastern turkey , where there are lots of ` poor rural dwellers ' . 
  iran was also a democratic nation and very western by all standarts . 
  look where they are now . 
  do n't be so arrogant as to dismiss this option . 
  ** blood for the blood god **, 
  state prosecutor of crimea in kiev -  asked for resignation , refused -  was given vacation and traveled from kiev to crimea -  joined new government . 
  she has applied for russian citizenship , whether or not it has been granted i do not know . 
  this would , however , mean that she gave up/has to give up her ukrainian citizenship . 
  right ... i 'm the one who is out of the loop . 
  sure thing . 
  being able to read kyrillic stands in no relation to any type of understanding to the circumstances and matter . 
  you said `` because she is a ukrainian citizen '' , which is simply not true . 
  she also handed in her resignation before travelling to crimea and while i am most definitly not a lawyer , such action would give grounds against high treason or whatever you might want to call it . 
  adressing your last paragraph . 
  again , you stated that she was wanted by the ukrainian government ** because ** she switched sides as a ukrainian citizen . 
  do not try to be condescending when you have to correct yourself . 
  your first source is also in ukrainian , which means very little . 
  from what i put into google translate it came out as the commitee has so far only obtained it . 
   googled it , found the info on russian wikipedia . 
  that 's great for you , i ca n't read russian . 
  the english wikipedia claims otherwise , pointing towards a bbc article . 
  suppose it 's also pretty sad that you assume everyone speaks russian ? 
  she participated after handing in her resignation , which was denied . 
  `` participation of illegal power usurpation '' sounds either made up or specifically ukrainian , which would be odd and only add to my argument , since that would mean there would have to be criminal cases against every . 
  single . 
  ukrainian living in donetzk and crimea now . 
  while i can not read ukrainian , apparently the criminal code has been changed , according to some [ sources ] ( http://www.carbonated.tv/news/ukraine-proposes-bill-to-criminalize-russian-aggression-denial-ceasefire-announced ) which criminalises denying russian aggression in the east . 
  whether that is true , i do not know for certain .
