  not sure where on that page you found that information , but i 'm looking and can not find the statistic . 
  a direct link would be appreciated . 
   then surely we need to stop migrants from all of africa going there to try and get on the boat to europe , right ? 
  since the country is a warzone and considered to be a semi-legitimate country of origin ( definitions differ ) , we are obligated by the right of asylum , which all eu countries signed , to provide them asylum . 
   but basically what you 're saing means : 1 . 
  those things never happened , or 2 . 
  those were good things nope , that 's what you would * like * to read . 
  and if we 're going to talk about the largest mass-killings the world has * ever * seen then you might want to look back couple of hundred years , especially the invasions of the huns or the mongols . 
  in recent history it 's mao zedong though , with a whopping 78 million estimated dead . 
  because they are the third most influential country in the eu , perhaps . 
  or because they are a netto-contributor . 
  or because they are one of the first eu states . 
   we are not obligated to take anyone yes , you are . 
  it 's called right of asylum and until you can prove that they are not eligible for it , you , just like any other country in the eu , have to take them . 
   brussels and berlin are the ones who should deal with it that 's funny , berlin and brussel are always supposed to deal with things eu wide when the others ca n't be bothered . 
  and is at fault for everything else , of course . 
  so fucking retarded , jesus ...  i understand their reasons , they want to have easy life right , 'cause the life is just * fucking peachy * . 
   we are not responsible for finding the solutions it 's politicians problem . 
  welcome to democracy , ** you ** are part of it . 
  hmm yeah ... that does n't work . 
  there are things like laws and all that ya know . 
   libya has a murder rate approximately equal to that of estonia or montenegro . 
  source that is not from 2005 . 
  otherwise i 'm calling bullshit . 
  it 's called right of asylum and you are part of it due to being part of the eu . 
  and they are going to live off of what exactly ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
  can people stop going around with that ** bullshit ** argument ? 
  it is a god . 
  damn . 
  lie . 
  for fucks sake . 
  [ here is how it works ] ( https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article154060168/ob-bayern-oder-bremen-ist-fuer-fluechtlinge-ein-grosser-unterschied.html ) every federal state receives 670 $ from the state for every refugee , that is for ** everything ** . 
  meaning from beds , food to teeth brush . 
  it 's all handed out by the state ( ideally ) and draws from that pool of 670 $ . 
  aside from that they receive between 70-120 $ ( not 400 for fucks sake ) for their own disgression . 
  meaning they can buy some personal clothes or whatever . 
  ( [ from here ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/fluechtlinge-in-deutschland-antworten-zum-taschengeld-a-1048432.html ) `` after the asylum seekers have left the first camps , they can claim monetary benefits between 287 and 358 $ , based on/orientated on the hartz iv benefits . '', 
  so no , they do n't receive shit-tons of money just for free and trust me , you do n't get very far with 300 $ for a month in germany unless you get * really * crafty . 
  welcome to oettinger , not only incompetent but also too dumb to keep his mouth shut as he is slowly drifting off into being irrelevant ( and soon hopefully without a job ) without ever coming back ... so say we all . 
  well , i mean ... there is a reason he sits at that position . 
  pretty much every nation throws their unwanted party members to the eu , hoping they go away . 
  never said that they did n't happen , so stop putting words in my mouth . 
  sure , why not ? 
  i 'd just like to say it 's great to have polish people around , if you 're looking for work , have at least one quarter of a brain and are open for other cultures and mindsets , germany will be more than happy to take you . 
  uhm , they do n't ? 
  how do you got to that conclusion ? 
  no , they did n't . 
  feel free to check [ this timeline ] ( http://isis.liveuamap.com/en/time/01.10.2016 ) for territorial changes starting at the october 1st . 
  ( they also did n't `` see it coming '' because it was announced and clear from the beginning . ), 
  the uk and us can independently decide whether to send troops somewhere or not . 
  germany ca n't , as is stated in the constitution . 
  if , however , one of the countries in the baltics were to ask at the european union for assistance , then it would be constitutional . 
   the only thing they `` reacted '' to was the west having a better system . 
  berlin crisis 1 and 3 beg to differ . 
  so does the cuba crisis . 
  christ dude , take a history lesson about the bi-polar world . 
   nor are they known for any kind of big atrocities or genocides . ', 
  * in the laotian civil war * oh man , i 'm sorry if you misunderstood that , but that was what i was talking about at that point . 
  :(  urss/communism was inherently evil communism was paved on a bloody path like every other ideology that has ever existed . 
  fascism tried it and capitalism did so as well . 
  hell , democracy is a massive blood bath , if you think about it . 
  in the end , communism lost and capitalism won . 
  that does n't make one or the other inherently `` evil '' , just like saying the nazis were `` evil '' is a bad excuse . 
  they were human . 
  just like the communists were all humans and there are people right now who are capable of the same atrocities and awful ideas and decisions . 
  was the ussr * wrong * in how it wanted to turn its vision into reality ? 
  from today 's perspective certainly , but turn your eye to china . 
  mao zedong committed the largest genocide in recent history , killing up to ** 78 million people ** ( let that thought sink in for a moment ) and what has happened ? 
  the people love him , he is regarded as a hero in modern china and china itself is one of the most powerful economical nations on earth . 
  able to rival the behemoth that the us military is for control of the pacific . 
  in the end , history is a harsh judge and things that worked in china did not work at all in europe . 
  since you seem to lack the ability to read i will reiterate for you . 
   ` nor are they ( urss ) known for any kind of big atrocities or genocides . ', 
  never said that . 
  what i said was , that thinking the ussr was reponsible * by far * for the most genocides in the 20th century , which is an utterly ridiculous and completely false statement . 
  hell , if you break it down nazi germany probably was responsible for more genocides in those few years . 
   holomodor definitly a genocide in my book , then again you will find few people who would deny this atrocity . 
  it 's more about the definition of a `` genocide '' not fitting as well as some would like  ribbentrop-molotov pact wat ... that makes no sense . 
  whatsoever . 
   supplying north korea with latest gen planes and pilots doesnt ' count as support . 
  never said that . 
  again . 
  let 's look at what i actually said :  do they actively support them like they did 50 years ago ? 
  definitly not or do you see north korea with brand new su-34 's or perhaps su-27 's ? 
  please , do actually read what i 'm writing and do n't just see what you would perhaps like to see . 
  nope , they were pretty much the same assholes that the us were . 
  but hey , why use that mushy pink mass between your ears if you could also just type something nonsensical and completely uninformed . 
  hey !, 
  that 's almost like the russians of today - good job . 
   no they fucking were n't internal affairs let 's just check real quick in the case of hungary : `` following the defeat of nazi germany , hungary became a satellite state of the soviet union . '', 
  my goodness , what a surprise . 
   the soviet union and its communist ilk were truly evil constructs that conducted not only the biggest mass killings the world has ever seen thanks for pointing out that you know next to nothing about the soviet union . 
  but nice try . 
  had it explained to me by someone much more well versed in that topic today . 
  he told me that they do not spread any kind of wahhabi , but rather an extremely tradionalist view of islam . 
  still islamistic crap that will nudge more than one or two guys on the path to violence , but it 's all coupled with the political views of the akp party and their propaganda . 
   russia supported north korea back then , and still support the regime today . 
  that highly depends on your definition of support . 
  do they have ties with north korea ?
