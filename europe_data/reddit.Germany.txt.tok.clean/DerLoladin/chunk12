  yes . 
  do they actively support them like they did 50 years ago ? 
  definitly not , otherwise there would n't be the un resolutions now , would there . 
   then there 's the viet cong and north vietnam oh you mean the war that south vietnam provoked ( with us backing this time around ) and when they began to get fucked the us intervened ? 
  yeah , i remember that . 
   khmer rouge in cambodia complete and utter horseshit . 
  the khmer rouge were primarily allied and supported by china and ** not ** the soviet union , who had their primary ally in vietnam . 
  who , as you may or may not know , were sworn enemies of the khmer rouge . 
  quite the contrary , it was nato countries and the us who went on to denounce vietnams acts of self-defense and back the khmer rouge in the un . 
   pathet lao in laos that 's funny , because the soviet union never actively participated in the laotian civil war . 
  nor are they known for any kind of big atrocities or genocides . 
  well , except the us dropping over 2 * million * pounds of bombs on laos , 30 % of which never detonated . 
  wait what were those bombs again ? 
  [ clusterbombs you say who are still maiming and killing dozens to this day ? 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/05/asia/united-states-laos-secret-war/ ) my , what a shame that was n't the soviet union . 
   the communist party in burma was never supported by the soviet union afaik . 
  khrushchev once made a visit to burma in 1955 and told them that they 're doing a good job with the peace treaty and peaceful co-existence . 
  that 's all . 
  the soviet union could n't even have supported them , as burma is china 's playground and they do n't share their toys with others . 
   russia and the communist movement that grew from there has been responsible for most of the genocides that have taken place in the 20th century . 
  you do n't actually believe that , do you ? 
  'cause south america might have a say in that , pointing their fingers north . 
  guatemala sends their regards . 
   have you ever heard of the seven days to the river rhine plan by the soviet union ? 
  i did , it was one of the many , many plans and simulations that the soviet union had in case of wwiii . 
  just like the other side . 
   and what do you call what happened in hungary or czechoslovakia ? 
  assuming you 're talking about the hungarian uprising/revolution in 1956 and the velvet revolution respectively , then they were internal affairs . 
  this is , again , not supposed to downplay any actions of the soviet union but rather put said actions into a better perspective . 
  oh it most certainly could be the same game . 
  then again the greens might actually have a spine , unlike the spd . 
  sure they would , especially when they have their own reasons . 
  for example , the child does not get along with 1 or 2 of his classmates . 
  the parents vented to the teacher who said that `` he ca n't do anything about that . '', 
  so the parents now decide that the child will not go to any events until the teacher does what * they * want . 
  pretty common as a ` threat ' believe it or not . 
  missing out on events also means a significant disadvantage for the student . 
  they took the trip to the mosque and next week the teacher wants them to do write a test on the religion . 
  what are the pillars of islam , what are the 2 biggest groups etc. 
  - good luck with that if you missed out the biggest info event . 
  because the grand coalition has been considered as one of their worst mistakes in recent history by the spd . 
  they have been completely drowned out and gone under . 
  whether unjust or not is not for you or me to decide , but for the courts in this case . 
  previously they put a law in place that did made the actions of the parents illegal . 
  that 's called the rule of law - it 's a thing in most of the modern world . 
  because otherwise you could just say ` nope ' for every school event there is . 
  you have to call the school in most cases and let them know . 
  some schools demand a letter from the doctor immediately others only after the 3rd day . 
  ( or not at all ... it 's weird ), 
  if you have to ask you must be a heretic, 
  but i thought they were all barbarians ( and i could n't find one with tomb kings in decent resolution ), 
  ** no one ** is saying they are victims for fucks sake . 
  ** read ** and you will discover that i was talking about a `` reactionary '' stance by the soviet union , which is exactly what happened . 
  [ literally germany right now ] ( https://imgur.com/a/o14cl ) in the view of r/worldnews, 
  each school can decide that for themselves . 
  some even allow students not to participate in sports and exercise lessons , others do n't . 
  yes your wife/girlfriend will also be forced to wear the hijab while you must not consume pork any longer and pray ** at least ** 3 times a day . 
  ramadan also is mandatory for * everyone * now and eid al-fitr is the most important holiday of the year , christmas is declared as haram . 
  the school clearly says they do ** not ** allow opting out . 
  the end . 
   it says % 33 of isis supporters from germany has a turkish background . 
  sure , but not if you view it in the context of turkey being the grand jewel of democracy and secularism in the middle east . 
  which it certainly was for quite a while . 
   aiming a powerful turkey is not a bad thing at all btw . 
  why not ? 
  it * is * a bad thing when the only means of doing so is by creating a `` us vs. 
  them ! '', 
  mentality , which is the same thing i experienced when i visited a turkish mosque with a friend of mine . 
  always coupled with the rhetoric of `` the good old islamic values '' . 
   anyway my point is that german culture is not the best culture for being assimilated peacefully . 
  society is extremely conservative in these kind of matters . 
  not at all . 
  everyone is free to practice their religion , holidays or wear whatever they want . 
  sure , if you go to the ultra-conservative corners of bavaria , you will find that mindset . 
  or saxony , but not within the general , younger populace . 
  perhaps my perception is a bit skewed in that regard , since i 'm from multi-kulti berlin , but the experience has been the same even in southern germany . 
  unless you act like an ass and go around telling people `` no pork is evil ! '', 
  or if you 're in hospital refuse to be treated by a women , no one cares . 
   these kind of things bring turks together in the end . 
  while that is partly true , in my experience it is just as much about `` perceived '' discrimination as it is about any real incidents . 
  especially when they hear stories about their parents and how they had to face discrimination and racism , turkish people become extremely defensive and have the tendency to project this `` perceived '' situation upon themselves . 
  misleading title : they do not face trial because they refused the mosque trip , but because they broke the law that makes school attendance mandatory . 
  some schools allow opting out , others do n't . 
  it 's the exact same thing as any other school lesson . 
   there are no exceptions to germany 's mandatory school law . 
  it 's not about `` opting out '' . 
  the school decided it to be mandatory , whether you agree or disagree is up to you , and the parents simply withheld the student from participating in the lesson . 
  which is against the law . 
  is there a thai-temple in the backwater that is ... um , ` itzehoe ' ? 
  because if there is n't , i doubt one can make the trip there in a single school lesson . 
  it 's part of cultural education . 
  there are better alternatives but if you only have 45 minutes of time and live in some backwater , then you take what you can get . 
   of course oppressive , hegemonic behavior too much rt consumption will lead to a severe case of polish/russian nationalism . 
  do n't do bullshit kids !, 
   if german government does n't pay for mosques what turkey should do may i ask ? 
  ai n't that the truth and a large part of the issue . 
  the church receives a boatload of money every year , the mosques do n't . 
  however , that does not excuse the spread of radical islam or nationalist ideals . 
   besides in turkish mosques there is no radical islamism . 
  that is quite simply false .
