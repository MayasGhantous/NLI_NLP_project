  here are both a [ english article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-growing-following-in-germany-the-dangerous-success-of-radical-young-clerics-a-816642.html ) on the matter and a [ german one ] ( https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article154689954/so-naehren-erdogans-prediger-islamismus-in-deutschland.html ) . 
  while the turkish mosques preach nationalism * as well * , they rely very heavily on islamist and radical views to go deliver and go hand in hand with these messages . 
  holy shit , are you actually suffering from mental degradation that you believe the soviets just willy-nilly decided one day that they were gon na spend huge amounts of money to build a wall ? 
  * fucking seriously ?!, 
  *  you do n't see how the second part contradicts the first here . 
  ... wow, 
  certainly , it 's no different across the border . 
  however , the support rarely roars up when a socialist brings up `` oh but here we have ... uhm ... trade !, 
  it 's evil ! '', 
  anti-eu or the `` we support russia '' - rhetoric tends to work much better , the latter being a horse that both the right and left like to jump on . 
  the berlin wall was a development that was long coming . 
  the soviet union wanted a common currency with west-germany , the allies implemented the dm anyways . 
  considering that the economical power of the soviet union was nowhere near that of the allies , who also held all the industrial centers , the number of people fleeing into the west and crossing the border for economical reasons , reached extreme numbers . 
  the west refused to acknowledge the problem ( because why would they ) and , still believing they were the `` better alternative '' the sed leadership decided on building the wall . 
  they did n't just build it 'cause they felt like it . 
  neither the soviet union nor china ever * encouraged * north korea to invade the south , it was kim-il-sung who went to stalin and asked him for permission and support . 
  mind you , this was during a time when many in the south were not very fond of their government , who had killed thousands of `` suspected communists '' , barred anyone not following the government line from office , imprisoned over 30.000 people and put more than 300.000 ( ! ), 
  into reducation camps . 
  i 'd bet you money , that you will find plenty of extreme views and borderline right-wing extremism with those who voted ` no ' . 
  they might not even know about it , but sadly , it 's widespread due to facebook and other easy-access social media . 
  ( there is a reason that plenty of right-wing members resort to using vk instead of facebook ), 
  that is ... not even at all what this is about . 
  it 's about the campaign which led up to this vote being dishonest and flat-out lying while going around saying `` oh we do n't actually care about the ukrainian sub-humans , we just hate the eu ! '', 
  sure , everyone has that kinda political scourge on both sides of the political spectrum . 
  the right-wing has sadly been very effective with that rhetoric . 
  considering that i did neither say nor claim that , your point is moot . 
  during the real cold war , it was the ussr who were reacting to the actions of the us and nato , for most of the time . 
  now it 's the other way around , nato has to react to the actions of russia . 
  even more , a russia under a certain leadership that values the status quo more than anything , with a `` last line of defense !, 
  '' - rhetoric that has always worked very well wit both russians and europeans . 
  this should not come to a surprise to anyone , considering that a large amount of mosques are funded by nations like turkey , saudi-arabia , iran and so on . 
  everyone of them spreading their own version of radical islam . 
  let 's just do it through the fourth rei - ... uhm , i mean of course the eu !, 
  a proper federalisation you say ? 
  hmm , well that reminds me of 1608 ... ah whatever , you just grab yourself lithuania and rename yourself to a few hundred years ago , we snack some parts of the czechs and rename the whole thing into prussia again . 
  opressed german and polish minorities ? 
  hey poland !, 
  do you want in on some glorious anschluss ? 
  do you actually want to know why ? 
  ah well , it just warms my * god damn heart * to see we are not the only nation with a bunch of lying , bullshitting right-wing nutjobs . 
  time to dig out the dailymail nl . 
  with a voter turnout of 32 % that is hardly a ` majority ' in context of population . 
  did i say ` disregard ' ? 
  no , i said `` take it with a grain of salt '' . 
  so , first of all this is ** not ** the house of lords . 
  secondly , he did not blame the `` jews '' as an entity , but one specific person as part of the larger reason . 
  whether there is any value in such a statement is questionable , but as always israel just * loves * to jump on these things and get out the barbed `` anti-semites !!! '', 
  whip, 
  while she is certainly not wrong , keep in mind that this is the same person who called the internet `` new ground for us all '' just 3 years ago . 
  so yeah , take a barrel of salt with these things . 
   you can heal from it . 
  and ** that ** is what 's wrong with the whole thing . 
  who cares about the perpetrators ? 
  may they rot in whatever hell they believe in - but no one cares or bothers about the victim . 
  where is the justice in that ? 
  seriously , i 'd love to hear the reasoning how such a sentence is `` good and just '' for the victim . 
  a gang-raped and mistreated 14 year old girl ( raped with bottles and other things ) and then left out in freezing temperatures , almost dying . 
   that 's bad mannered and totally inappropriate but not illegal i am afraid . 
  illegal in the sense that the judge justified his sentence due to the accused showing `` remorse '' - hell yeah . 
  does n't really make sense , eh ? 
   this is just an unfounded claim . 
  afraid not . 
  first hand information from a long-time friend of mine who had multiple run-ins with the law during his time as a teenager . 
  the places where he should work off his social hours most often did not even know about him and no one ever bothered to tell them either , so they could not let him work . 
  therapy hours were never setup or on a month-to-month basis . 
  but yeah , damn all those social things work god damn * wonders * . 
  good thing then that you 're not a child with 15 or 16 , but a juvenile . 
   nd gang raping someone who is 14 is n't really something you do out of hightened emotions and tensions . 
  true , it 's something you do because you are a fucked up piece of shit for whatever reasons . 
  sure , but then such a thing should be decided on a case-by-case basis and not just with a general `` ah well , they did n't know any better . '', 
  seriously , they are able to leave the courtroom cheering and waving , while the victim will have to bear that weight for the rest of her life ( who knows how long that will be , suicides are very common in juvenile rape victims ) . 
  the supposed `` social education '' or therapy will * never * happen . 
  the justice system does not care whether they show up or not , as long as they are out of the courtroom . 
   the minors realize that too late . 
  tough shit . 
  so do plenty of adults after they have committed a severe crime due to hightened emotions and tensions . 
  most criminals do not fully comprehend the consequences of their crimes , especially for their victims . 
  does n't mean they deserve some kind of slap on the wrist and a `` but next time i wo n't be so lenient , young man ! '', 
  `` different '' , yes . 
  are they still able to comprehend the severity of a crime like `` rape '' or `` murder '' ? 
  yes . 
  16 year olds are young and juvenile , not retarded . 
  neither can you say that * every * 40 year old is able to comprehend the full extend of their actions . 
  some people are just idiots . 
  or uninformed . 
  that does n't mean they do n't know that it 's wrong , unless they are psychopaths and lack the sense for that . 
  perhaps not for the girl , but * hell fucking yeah * they are aware of the consequences for themselves . 
  it 's been a bit since i was 16 but i was well aware that rape falls into the same category of `` fucked up '' as murder and is punished harshly ( or so i believed back then ) . 
  stop acting like they are 12 or some kind of idiot potato . 
  strongly disagree with that notion . 
  while certain crimes should be within that rule , a 16 year old can perfectly well comprehend the act he is committing as well as the consequences . 
  it 's the saltwater that leaks into them , i 'm afraid . 
  that 's the way i was told to prepare them anyways . 
   more fitted for their age bullshit , we are talking about ** gang rape ** not punching another guy on a party or stealing some cigarettes . 
  it was more of a joke i eat pelmeni on a semi-regular basis and aside from being incredibly salty , they are really good . 
  the pancakes are also pretty awesome . 
  unfortunately russian food is a bit like british food . 
  the bad outnumbers the good , in my opinion . 
  borsch is not very exciting anyways , 
  ah so you are against a democratic system ?
