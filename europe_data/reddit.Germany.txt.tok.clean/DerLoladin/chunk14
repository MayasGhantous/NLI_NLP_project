  there are around 8 million us citizens who are more or less constantly abroad . 
  now you have to find out where and when they are where exactly , print the pamphlets and pay for shipping for all of them . 
  that 'd be a huge effort and pretty massive costs . 
  it 's not the federal government 's job . 
  it would be the responsibility of the us government to do so , at an incredible cost as they would have to inform * everyone * . 
  it 's also rather unreliable . 
  so sure , it would be better . 
  however , unless the us can find a magical donkey that spits and shits gold , i do n't see that happening . 
  not mad at all , simply stating the reality of it . 
   you going to be this upset should whoever you do n't like wins or not ? 
  if it came down to me none of them would win because both trump and hillary suck . 
  but in the end i do n't really care . 
   all i 'm saying is keep the advertisement at home . 
  as i have already explained , few people know about their voting right when they are abroad . 
  so informing them is a * good thing * , especially considering that this election could shape the future of their country quite drastically . 
  tough shit , that 's a democratic system for ya . 
  right , 'cause as we can all see there is just an absolute * wave * of support in this thread !, 
  no doubts or any sarcasm whatsoever . 
   because after the fall of the ussr all of gorbachev 's agreements were made retroactively illegal , so ukraine is still russian russian sovereign citizens / \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f-b\u00fcrger . 
   imagine if there was an ad for danish elections in new york ? 
  alright i 'm imagining ... now what ? 
  everyone can place an ad and if someone were to be concerned about the danish elections and the danish citizens living in new york not voting , then he could place such an ad . 
   it 's the reminder america still owns europe to me . 
  well , welcome to reality . 
  the country that has the largest influence over the european continent is the us afterall . 
   people do n't need to be reminded to vote or not hell yes , they do !, 
  most probably do n't even * know * that they can vote abroad , considering that around 50 % of all americans in the us completely forget about it as well . 
  huh ? 
  it 's an advertisement to get american citizens who live abroad to vote . 
  the depiction of trump on this one is really light-hearted , so i do n't see the issue aside from butthurt americans . 
  the nato force of 4000 men and women being send to the baltics is led by the us , uk , france and germany , each leading 1000 . 
  omg muh anglosaxon control , the rothschilds control us all !!!, 
  do you think about the coffee you make every morning ? 
  or about driving a car like it was your first driving lesson ? 
  no , you do n't because you probably have other things to think about . 
  same applies in this scenario . 
  spain has refueled russian ships for years , no one ever really bothered or cared - until now . 
  certainly , it would n't necessarily kill all possibilities , but make it much more difficult . 
  considering that the greens supporting ceta would go a long way for the cdu to say `` hey , they are good coalition partners !, 
  they want the same things we want ... kinda ! '', 
  this is not the police , it 's the anti-corruption agency . 
  the most competent actor for those matters in all of europe , funded by the eu and not by the government , mind you . 
  then [ report it ] ( http://www.mai-dga.ro/index.php?l=en ) . 
  the only way to fix it is if you personally do something about it . 
  black-green is currently the most likely coalition and probably the most functional , considering that red-red-green is bound for disaster . 
  oh good , so we change nothing ? 
  thanks !, 
  `` plis give bailout euromonies , we are not ded yet ! '', 
  aaah alright , there we go . 
  `` not the result i wanted , must be corruption and vote fraud ! '', 
  thank you for your ... ` opinion ' . 
  while the greens on a `` basis '' and federal level might protest a bit , in the end they are probably looking for a black-green coalition next year ... meaning they have to choose between a rock and a hard place . 
  do they support ceta and make their coalition more likely but risk loosing voters ? 
  or do they basically throw the coalition but hope to retain their voters ? 
  your democraticly elected officials said `` yes '' to the trade deal , both those you elected into brussel and in bucharest . 
  just like everywhere else - that 's how a democracy works . 
  if you do n't like the result , tough shit . 
  very little will change , as most countries do that already anyways . 
  newest example that springs to my mind : germany wants to buy drones . 
  there were 3 competitors , northtrop grumman , general atomics and iai . 
  very quickly iai was chosen , too quickly to consider it a fair process . 
  ( germany had already been chartering the heron 1 before ) so northtrop grumman went `` wait what ? 
  nope , fuck that . 
  this was unfair treatment ! '', 
  and an internal court , who knew their shit , said `` true . 
  you have to re-do the process for the drone aquisition '' if the product of northtrop grumman would have been flat-out better , then the decision would also have been different . 
  as i said in [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59hh5g/russian_fleet_will_no_longer_refuel_in_spain/d98q931/ ) it was mostly likely a minor thing for spain that most forgot about in the current political climate over there . 
  afterall , nato never cared for the occassional russian navy ship . 
  multiple times even , yes . 
  that 's some really interesting statistics . 
  i 'm almost more surprised by the high crime rate from central and southeast asia . 
  bit of a difference between building something and laying down their lives . 
  while you are right , this would require an eu army to only exist with all member states , rather than only those who want to join . 
  it would also mean that all states have to agree on a course of action , rather than a majority . 
  especially the last part would bring huge resistance along with it . 
  french and romanian soldiers fighting for a course of action suggested by italy ? 
  ** ridiculous ** , some might say . 
  in the end it will have to come to that , otherwise europe will be eternally dvivied . 
  but for that more time needs to pass . 
  ah with the non-schengen part it makes more sense . 
  damn that is a pretty damning number for the serbians , albanians and so on ... 
  adding up the numbers means one can make a rough guess on the population of asylum seekers in finland and , with the statistic , taking a look at how common/likely sexual offences are in that population . 
  ( in relativity to the general population of finland )  the other study i linked looks at ethnicity but not at relativity to the general size of population . 
  so while africans and people from the middle east are more likely to commit sexual offences and crimes , they also make up a much smaller part of the population than estonians or russians . 
  right now , there is ** no one ** who could fill that role . 
  the eu itself is too divided and busy with itself to make any meaningful decision in that regard , even if it were there are still more than enough eurosceptics and anti-federalists to oppose anything moving forward . 
  the uk is alright-ish , but even their military is in rough shape with all the budget and personnell cuts . 
  france is way too busy with itself and germany can not find the nuts and bolts to keep its vehicles and helicopters together . 
  oh what 's that we are n't allowed to order any new ones due to budget cuts ? 
  aight then . 
  the italians are a non-factor , not being able to decide if they are pro-eu or anti-eu , one day with a competent government that has a presence and gets shit done and the next day with a bunch of drooling idiots . 
  for now , europe has to rely on the us . 
  if i read that statistic correctly , which is rather difficult since it 's in finnish , it suggests that other europeans commit 10x more rape ? 
  directly from the article :  during january-september 2015 , 246 foreign nationals were suspects in reported sex crimes . 
  this year that figure was 525 . 
  asylum seekers were suspected offenders in 129 cases . 
  however , it does not state exactly `` what '' crimes they are suspected of , as previously it differentiated between `` suspected rape '' , `` sexual harassment '' and `` sexual abuse of minors '' . 
  from the website of the interior :  since 2000 , finland has received 1,500 -- 6,000 asylum seekers annually . 
  in 2014 , their number stood at 3,651 . 
  in 2015 , there has been a sharp increase in the number , and it is expected to reach up to 30,000 - 35,000 this year .
