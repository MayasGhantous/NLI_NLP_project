  if we add those numbers up ( and my math is terrible so please correct me ) we still get a proportionally higher amount of sexual offences by asylum seekers , but certainly not 17x as likely . 
   yeah , stealing our jobs and all that jazz . . again . 
  if by `` our '' you mean the eu then yes , you are quite right . 
  and i 'd prefer it if the `` brains '' would stay in the eu instead of hopping back to asia or north america as soon as they are done studying here . 
   the guys at the wheel are rather intelligent and determined and masterfully keep the country under their thumb . 
  a start would be to stop voting for putin and his party , then again , i am well aware that russians value stability over everything else . 
  that is probably also one of the biggest reasons that people might not be happy , but far from actually doing anything about it - if they did , they 'd risk the stability of the country . 
   we could host millions of stduents with what has been put in the ground for nothing there . 
  you do not have any idea just how expensive education on that level is , do you now ? 
   foreign students do n't generate taxes already by just living here and buying and renting stuff ? 
  not enough to pay back the cost . 
   you got your education for free too . 
  and i 'm paying that back by paying taxes . 
  did i mention that i 'm a german citizen ? 
  meaning i have a right to free education , those who are n't do n't . 
  foreign students are great and all that , if they actually stay in the country * or * pay money back for their education . 
  there are , for example , massive issues in berlin with asian students who come here , finish studying and immediately head back to asia . 
  the state gains nothing in the end , only loosing a study place that could have gone to an eu or german citizen who would actually * stay * in the country . 
   why somewhere else ? 
  because we 're not a welfare state for anyone who just wants to move in , grab and move out again . 
  that is why we have laws [ like these ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/12/german-government-approves-bill-to-stop-eu-migrants-claiming-benefits ) because people from inside and outside the eu come here and get free shit . 
  that 's not how it works * anywhere * else . 
   if even a small sign of disbelief   yeah , cool story man . 
  those organizations are advertising as we speak : `` only $ 300 and 1 week for schengen - contact us today and get a huge discount ! '', 
  choose one, 
  a whopping 30 troops , my god , a true invasion force . 
  nothing special about it . 
  it 's mostly the same argument you will hear in bavaria as well , where conservative notions are strong . 
  `` i do n't ** care ** about the coal plant !!!, 
  it has ** always ** been there !, 
  even my parents told me it was always there - i hate , hate , hate new things !! '', 
   a long term money winner what is that exactly ? 
  is spain hosting a raffle with the russian navy as a `` long-term '' winner ? 
  huh ? 
  why ? 
  spain has other issues currently so it 's likely no one even cared . 
  then nato and other nations complained and spain went `` oh , huh . 
  i guess there was something like that . '', 
  yeah * right * ... 
  i was more talking about organizations that offer things for eastern european/russian tourists like vouching for visas or offer things like 50 $ for a week in city x or y in a shared flat and such . 
  but alas , it 's all just me , an evil western capitalist-fascist , speaking . 
  so do n't take anything of what i 'm saying serious, 
  certainly and i never claimed that to be false . 
  yet , the people * have * the access , it 's all there . 
  russia is not like north korea ( yet ) where the people simply can not get access to any of those information . 
  i 'd wager , even though i have never been in that region , that even the people living up in siberia are able to go to their library , look at the bbc or reuters and gather their information . 
  while it 's easy to say from the outside , the russian people have all the power but change never comes without sacrifice . 
  currently it 's changes that only hurt the average russian and bolster the upper class , while the people are being told that its all the fault of the west ... 
   what is all this pointless travel demagoguery about ? 
  another user above took issue with my statement about the responsibilities of the russian people for their current situation . 
  his/her statement saying that russians could not be blamed as they ( and i will shorten this ) `` have no way of knowing any better . '', 
  i took issue with that statement , saying that most russiand do have access to the internet . 
  if not at home then via their phone , at friends/family or in a public library . 
  or they could travel and see for themselves , if they really wanted to . 
  as i said , there are organisations providing that for russians who wish to travel abroad . 
  would love to copy-paste from the website , unfortunately it wo n't let me . 
  alas , declarations of sponsorship and/or guarantee letters from hosts are very common here with organisations providing them as well . 
   plus you have to prove you have at least some property and/or family in russia . 
  had to do the same thing three times over when applying for a visa at the russian embassy . 
   depends on an entry country , an applicant may be required to show up for a consulate interview . 
  had to do that the first two times i went to russia , the third time i had someone else vouch for me . 
  it is a pain but a normal process that everyone has to do , regardless if i want to travel to russia , indonesia or the us . 
   first of all , if you exclude moscow and if i were to exclude frankfurt , m\u00fcnchen , stuttgart from the german average , it would also fall quite a bit . 
  that 's not how an average works . 
   if you book well in advance literally went with the first google result search machine for the 10th of november . 
  not really `` well in advance '' but actually pretty short-time . 
   are not fascinated by the idea of spending half their monthly salary and a week of their time to live in a shitty hostel and eat supermarket food instead of local specialties . 
  especially when travelling to a larger city there are a shit-ton of alternatives to that . 
  even so , this is not about whether you `` like '' the idea but whether your average russian * can * travel . 
   some people have salaries at about millions of rubles . 
  so does * every other country * - yet only in russia such metrics are `` not reliable '' ? 
  my , my . 
  what a surprise . 
   and speaking about moscow who is talking about moscow ? 
  people tend to * drive * to airports , you know . 
  ahahahahahaha alright , now i know you 're joking, 
  did i say that ? 
  all i said is that `` foreign nationals '' , in the case of finland , means estonians and russians to a large degree . 
  just like north africans and sub-sahara immigrants are the largest factor at selling drugs in berlin . 
  does n't mean they * all * do that , but plenty enough . 
   plane ticket costs at about middle russian salary . 
  the `` middle russian salary '' is around 36k rub , as i just showed you . 
   and you also need place to live , something to eat . 
  food is cheap , so is a place to sleep and live , hell , there are russian communities in berlin who organise that for like 20 $ . 
  unfortunately these kinda threads automatically attract all the closet nazis and `` concerned citizens '' . 
  if any of them were to read the article and gather some understanding of the region , then they might even gather that a higher proportion of reports is a likely cause as well as plenty of russian and estonian nationals commiting such crimes . 
   unfortunately , these days dictatorship is the only way to keep independence . 
  let 's hope you 're not serious . 
  most countries seem to be rather independent ... or is anyone still holding onto some colonies ?!, 
  britain !, 
  get over here ** right now ** !, 
  the average monthly wage in russia is currently [ 36115 rub ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/wages ) which translates into roughly 520 $ . 
  a trip from moscow -  berlin and back 1 week later , costs around about 130-150 $ . 
  another 35 $ for the visa and no , you do not need to go through 5000 applications or some shit . 
  so that makes the whole trip around 170 $ . 
  and that is with ** flight ** , by train is significantly cheaper . 
   it states only about possibility of usage it states about possible usage as ` certain ' usage is difficult to obtain . 
  however , this means that over 70 % of all russians have access to the internet , if they want to . 
  you second paragraph does not even make any sense to me . 
  they can travel , if they want .
