  it 's not expensive , for god 's sake i have friends from russia over in germany every year who have to live with 5 family members to pay rent , yet they can * still * travel . 
  [ this statistic suggests otherwise , with internet penetration only behind germany by 9 % . 
  ] ( http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/russia/ ) your link is an old study from 2009 , so not very accurate any longer . 
   yeah . 
  you should only make a couple of documents and a visa . 
  and a ticket of course . 
  and grab some money you save with your $ 300 salary . 
  hmm , that 's weird , how do other russians on exactly that sallery manage to travel outside of russia ... oh right , i remember , because they * want * to . 
  a visa and some documents are not particularly difficult and mostly just an annoyance ( same goes for travelling to russia as well , i 'm talking from experience ) while a ticket to the scandinavian nations is rather cheap ... hell , even a ticket to germany for that matter is cheap !, 
  well , tough shit . 
  means you would have had to study somewhere else or get a job and * then * pay for it . 
  only because you stayed does n't mean anyone else does . 
  berlin is so massively overcrowded with foreign students from outside the eu , it 's not even funny . 
  9 out of 10 also leave immediately again . 
  perhaps , perhaps not . 
  that 's not giving you the money back you invested into people who came here solely to study . 
   but it 's not the people whom you should blame . 
  fuck yeah you should blame the people !, 
  christ , what is this apologetical bullshit . 
  we live in the day and age of the internet , of free movement and of free information . 
  anyone can go out and look for it or travel a bit outside of russian borders . 
  fact of the matter is , most russians do not * want * anything else but an authoritarian government . 
  that 's how it has allways been and that 's how it should allways stay . 
  going from the zar-state to communism and now back to an ultra-nationalist/authoritarian government did not help at all . 
   you have virtually no idea of life inside russia and all it 's internal societal problems and struggles perhaps he does n't , but i do . 
  and he is right . 
  oh wait that makes me probably a fascist and capitalist-pig ... oh well . 
  * riiight * , 'cause you ca n't be critical of both . 
  whataboutism is the worst part of russian propaganda ... and you 've had your fill apparently . 
  why though ? 
  you have the sun and the dailymail to inform you about such complicated things / s, 
  * from the left-wing of course . 
  cdu is not really a great choice but there is little else . 
  was n't being completely serious , but since i 'm from berlin it 's a very uncommon term . 
  spd ceased being a respectable party quite some time ago . 
  the `` true '' spd politicians , like willy brandt are right now spinning in their graves so fast , you could probably power all the failing industry in nrw with it . 
  good job spd btw . 
  their politics are a joke , their politicians are an even bigger joke . 
  the greens are the only party one could realistically vote for without having some kind of sadistic/masochistic preference . 
  since this is not a thread or discussion about ethnicity but rather the nationality of the people under investigation , they are russians . 
  but thanks for the information nontheless . 
  sooo ... russians ? 
  good , thanks . 
   they are universally seen as a poster child of the western press from 10 years ago wat . 
  you must be reading some odd news then , because chechens are well established as terrorists and insurgents , fighting with the taliban and isis . 
  also religious nutjobs . 
  still russian though . 
  as soon as you turn 18 . 
  yet they are still all considered russians . 
  or is this supposed to be some kinda `` not a * real * scotsmen ! - argument, 
  they might as well have been from behind the moon , if they are russian citizens then they are russian citizens . 
  unless you want to disprove the article , there is no difference reported here . 
  they could be chechens or of any other ethnicity from russia . 
  at court they made a show of it and let themselves be celebrated . 
  even at process begin we were witness to absurd scenes . 
  with the accused happily greeting friends and family in the viewing area as well as posing in victory stances . 
   a mild sentence does n't exclude compensation for damages uhm , yes it does when it comes to minors . 
   the idea of a especially criminal justice for youth in germany is to avoid to make them to welfare receivers the whole life sure , for small crimes like stealing . 
  or hell , even an assault or drug posession . 
  but gang rape with ( unproven ) intent of murder ? 
  now ** that ** is some strong apologetical bullshit right there . 
  huh ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  the court has named them as 15 , 16 and 17 . 
   by calling them nazis you just ignore their criticism of the corrupt media . 
  oh but i 'm not ignoring their criticism !, 
  if it was founded by any foundation other than blatant racism and not hearing the kinda news that they * want * to hear to reinforce their opinion . 
  is this america ? 
  because last time i checked , being a communist is not illegal . 
  also :  seumas milne is a guardian columnist and associate editor . 
  he was the guardian 's comment editor from 2001 to 2007 after working for the paper as a general reporter and labour editor . 
  so he is a columnist and has a tiny editorial position . 
  a communist in one of the world 's largest left-leaning newspapers . 
  colour me * shocked and outraged !, 
  from the article itself  investigators are targeting an additional 10 men and three women - all russian federation citizens in their 20s and 30s - as they look deeper into suspected militant financing . 
  so no , russians . 
  not chechen asylum seekers . 
   for a russian , germany is basically a no go country to seek asylum in . 
  if you can prove that you have a right for asylum then you go right ahead . 
  fortunately/unfortunately that is not the case for most russians , as they tend to be economic migrants . 
   he mockery of russia 's flagship naval vessel has apparently become so irksome to some in moscow that the komsomolskaya pravda newspaper even commissioned blogger sergei leleka to pen a column titled `` why the admiral kuznetsov blackens europe 's sky . '' in the text , leleka claims that the ship only produces black smoke `` as a tradition , '' arguing that there 's nothing wrong or outdated about the engine exhaust . 
  `` this is a signal , '' he says , `` as if to tell everyone , ` i 've arrived , hello ! ' or ` i am leaving , goodbye ! ' or ` i 'm on my way ! '''  leleka says the smoke can be used as a friendly signal to allies , communicating that help is on the way , or as a menacing gesture to foes , warning that russia 's naval might is en route . 
  hahaha , right . 
  sure ... in the age of smartphones and satellites russia bets on smoke signals for communication . 
   eleka wrote that nossik and parkhomenko could only be cured of their sudden military expertise `` in the gas chamber . ''  the remark resembles a similar anti-semitic comment published in the same newspaper in 2013 , when another columnist lamented that the nazis failed to `` make lampshades '' of the grandfathers of today 's anti-kremlin oppositionists . 
  [ a source about the recent events in saxony ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/world/europe/germany-arrest-syrian-refugee.html ) and [ another about refugees as informants for the bnd ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-03/bnd-bamf-interventionsfaelle-befragungen ), 
  ah , so now it is so because you say so . 
  good to know . 
  what a bunch of horseshit . 
  * everyone * is criticising merkel just as much as others praise her , it 's called ` open debate ' ya know . 
  you 're called a nazi if you vote for afd , hate on merkel while screaming `` l\u00fcgenpresse !, 
  so kinda acting like [ these dumb fucks ] ( https://twitter.com/tilsteff/status/782870989092904961?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ), 
  that 'd be your opinion , which is perfectly fine . 
  discrimination does n't work that way , nor does insult . 
  if you were to go up to someone who is gay and begin to insult * him * directly , that 'd be insult . 
  discrimination would be , if you were a cashier and a lesbian couple came up to you and you said `` we/i do n't deal/serve * your kind * here ! '', 
  it 's almost like the two countries which hold the most economical power over a large part of europe and pose the largest military threat to a large part of europe , would be mentioned . 
  geez now that 's weird ... 
  [ weird ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/23/polish-mps-back-near-total-ban-on-abortion-which-could-see-women/ ) the telegraph seems to do [ exactly that ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/polish-journalists-lash-out-at-new-purge-culture-in-state-media/ ) while avoiding all but the `` populist '' mark . 
   `` mir schw\u00e4tzen letzebuergsch '' so they want ` schw\u00e4bisch ' as their first language ?
