  okay . 
  stupid , but okay . 
  always seems so odd how russians ( well , in this case its mostly ` edgy ' westerners ) care so deeply about what others thing of them . 
  seriously , r/russia is only alive for circlejerks about how r/europe is trying to create a drift between russians and europeans and how gay and totally evil homosex we all are . 
  such a tabloid rag that just happens to win [ prizes and awards ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/awards ) like pocket change . 
  but it 's all because of ` muh conspiracy ! ', 
  ** hurr durr breitbart best media !!, 
  oh good !, 
  so you have sources who can claim otherwise and that they are none of these things !, 
  i 'm waiting . 
  in german everyone i 've met calls it `` tschechien '' and not `` tschechische republic '', 
  sooo , first of all they are russians . . second of all , refugees have helped stop more terrorist attacks so far than `` causing '' them . 
   could someone from those people ( the one 's who called us conspiracy theorists ) tell what you think now ? 
  :d you are mentally challenged , since the people who were raided are russians . 
  not the brightest candle on the chandelier eh ? 
  has a paywall on it, 
  likely born in germany with german citizenship - or are you trying to imply something ? 
  an absolute farce and disgrace of a trial . 
  the judge calls them `` repentent '' even though they were cheering in the courtroom , waving to friends and family . 
  unfortunately this is the full laxety of the german law when it comes to minors , you can pretty much get away with anything if you 're under 18 . 
  that 's not a joke . 
  yeh i always forgot about those !, 
  geez that 's a tough call , who do you let in , gypsis or terrorists ? 
  britain is under siege !, 
   `` taking into account multiple statements made by norwegian officials about the absence of threat from russia to norway , we would like to understand why norway is so much willing to increase its military potential , in particular through the stationing of american forces in vaernes , '' i love this assumption , like nato does not even exist . 
  or a certain country called `` ukraine '' ... what was happening in the east there again ? 
  well , it 's like this is an accurate map , kant being claimed for russia and all that . 
  * riiiight * , because everyone wants to come to britain . 
  get a grip for gods sake , the uk does not have rivers made out of milk and honey . 
  if you 're referring to hitler then i have to dissapoint you , it 's rather well known that he was austrian . 
  and , if he 'd qualify for `` most well-known for germany '' then it 'd be stalin for russia as well , although he was georgian . 
  [ if you can not win in the regular ways , you just win in all the * other * ways !, 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37403242 ), 
  so people should be paid less than others while also paying more because `` that is how it should be . '', 
  are you really that stupid or just acting like it ? 
  sure , if the wages were increased by at least 50 % you might also be able to argue that . 
  but they are n't . 
   and the housing in berlin is nothing compared to other capital cities whataboutism . 
  have other capital cities been united for only around 20 years ? 
  have certain * other * capital cities of europe perhaps been the capital of the world since hundreds of years ? 
  have other capital cities perhaps a different flair and size to them , as well as * not * being known for being rather cheap ... like berlin ? 
  oh and what about those capitals who are much cheaper ? 
  or how about stockholm and helsinki , where you earn quite a bit more . 
   because only hipsters and people on welfare live there . 
  yeah , around 4 million hipsters and people on welfare live here ... 
  really now ? 
  well that 's funny , i live in spandau , as far from the `` trendy '' area as you could possibly be and not only are apartments extremely hard to find but also ** ridiculously ** expensive . 
  but sure , everything is fine and reasonable . 
  in that case it seems more logical that the western world was reluctant to help in such a situation . 
  while it is sadly lacking in the possible amount of equipment that can be loaded onto the plane ( i blame politics for that though ) , it needs only a very short landing strip while also [ boasting some incredible maneuverability ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ioyrmnydg ) . 
  the special prop-design can be both used to accelerate very quickly , as well as slow the plane down just as fast . 
  you brits have bought enough bmw 's to qualify for anschluss . 
  sure i care , mostly about work though . 
  and i get very emotional when people are inefficent , might even start a war or two over it . 
  ca n't say i care, 
  while true , it 's not a comparison you can apply, 
  not in my experience when travelling through the republic . 
  while luxury goods are around the same price , especially groceries are * much * cheaper . 
  it 's much less in the czech republic , on the other hand rent and everything else is * much * cheaper . 
  so do n't know what you are on about . 
  that matters not as much in denmark though , as the average wage is at $ 3100 while it is only $ 2265 in germany . 
  and trust me , it is quite a bit less in berlin as major cities like munich , frankfurt or stuttgart are dragging that number extremely high , due to the high income there . 
  since the 80 's berlin has been growing but only in recent years , starting around 2005/2006 has the city attracted around 50.000 new inhabitants every year . 
  now that would not be an issue in and of itself , however , since berlin became more attractive for investors , large firms and corporations , landlords have started to increase the rent at * ridiculous * rates . 
  while completely forgetting about affordable housing . 
  especially older apartments , of which there are quite a lot , have been sought after . 
  [ here is a recent development ] ( http://www.wohnungsboerse.net/mietspiegel-berlin/2825 ) , considering that berlin has always been cheaper ( which is the only way you could afford anything due to the significantly lower wages ) this means a huge jump in rent . 
  did i ever say merkel gives a shit ? 
  claiming that italy does not have broad ties to russia , who also are working to extend them , which is certainly a strong motivation is rather dishonest . 
  renzis decision has little to do with simply `` missing a word '', 
  not really ... at all . 
  berlin is ridiculously expensive considering the low wages in the area . 
  larger apartments are cheaper , as few people want or need them , however 1-2 room apartments are very , ** very ** pricey !, 
  was zombie-hitler riding on a dinosaur called `` blondie '' in there ? 
  do n't worry , they 're all ugly anyways . 
  i 'm ^ sorry ^ ^ kinda, 
  quick question , in the picture where the `` secret police '' man can be seen with this description :  a secret policeman ( left ) moments before he was shot dead outside the budapest communist party headquarters . 
  after the building ( out of shot on right ) was stormed , 23 of the hated secret police were shot or beaten to death by the crowd . 
  is he trying to surrender ? 
  not sure what 's happening but he seems unarmed . 
   `` we should do everything possible for a peace deal in syria but it 's difficult to imagine that this should be linked to further sanctions on russia , '' renzi told reporters `` buuuuut , we do n't really give a shit , so who cares eh ? '', 
  depending where you live you can allways move to potsdam , oranienburg , magdeburg or cottbus and enjoy cheap rents . 
  hell , you could move to any of those cities and still work in berlin anyways !, 
  as i said , your own apartment , not a wg . 
  and even those are pretty damn expensive . 
  makes sense , no need to cruise to the phillippines if they come to you willingly, 
  stay loyal to putin or there will be gulag , u/a _ nest_of_nope, 
   and carriers exist only to throw bombs at 3rd world countries that ca n't fight back . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  that 's the dumbest statement that i have heard in a week or so . 
  russia would * love * to build them , instead they will likely sell the plans to china . 
  depends largely on where you live . 
  young person in berlin , looking for an apartment ? 
  good luck m8, 
  certainly , however , you also go somewhere where the know-how is already established and have it done there . 
  israel did not buy off the shelf in germany but made a contract with hdw for their own type of submarine . 
  the same goes for other nations , if the know-how simply is n't there , you outsource at least the production . 
  in terms of new submarines for the royal netherlands navy , even hdw has a solution for that , the type 216 . 
  40 % longer , more operational endurance , 5 more crew and ion-lithium batteries . 
   plus we want to maintain our knowledge by actively being involved in the design and construction .
