  the cooperation between germany and the netherlands is already very close , another reason why i 'd see germany as the first ones to talk to for new aquisitions . 
   is probably around 100-110 million euros perhaps , it 's certainly a number that i can imagine due to the inflation and the constant backpaddeling of nations . 
  [ this source ] ( http://www.airpower.at/news03/0516_ef-preis/ ) quotes the tranche 1 eurofighter at 85 million euros and the tranche 2 at 110 million . 
  * however * they are very expensive in austria , due to the small amount ordered . 
   14.7 billion euros/108 aircraft , or 136 million euros each . 
  the german reports are incredibly inaccurate !, 
  the numbers change all the time and the beschaffungsamt is not releasing the correct numbers to anyone ( it 's pretty fucked up ) . 
  also , germany has been constantly backpaddeling on how many eurofighters they actually want . 
  starting from 250 , now down to 180 . 
  meaning they have gotten more and more expensive , with airbus even asking for 500 million in compensation for the bullshittery they had to endure . 
   captor-m is pesa , not aesa . 
  you are certainly correct , my mistake . 
  as far as i understand it , captor-e comes with tranche 3 and the development was rather slow due to the nations involved in the project simply lost interest and kinda went `` eh , good enough . '', 
  and only recently got back to it . 
  considering that the first prototype already flew in 2006 , it could have been done long ago with enough interest , most likely . 
   promoting stereotypes of evil syrian government . 
  troll detected, 
  everyone is doing that already anyways . 
  this is pretty much designed to say `` well , at least the law is covering your ass just in case ! '', 
  the ` outrage ' about the nsa spying on merkel was mostly facilitated , nothing else . 
  it 's a farce between two governments and everyone knows that . 
  i have to admit that i know relatively little about esa and the specifics regarding that topic . 
  my knowledge extends as far as what i said , that failures are a part of it . 
  you seem to have a deeper understanding however . 
   i think there 's something wrong with how we engineer things in europe . 
  or how we requestion things . 
  while i can not comment on esa , i can do so in regards to airbus and thw a400m disaster . 
  the issue is relatively simple if you get down to it , it 's supposed to be a european project to cut the reliance on us technology as well as keep the money in the european economy . 
  to achieve that , new technology has to be created , new firms founded , new people hired . 
  the a400m is an incredible aircraft , sadly not as good as it was supposed to be . 
  however , a large part of it comes down to much of the expertise being stuck in the us or russia for such aircraft . 
  everything has to start somewhere and be build up . 
  eurocopter is a great example of this , building amazing helicopters easily rivaling everything else on the market , now that they have the expertise , facilities and name for it . 
  airbus will get there as well , but you need to learn how to walk before you can run marathons . 
  now onto the second part , requesition . 
  europe as a market is a ridiculous challenge for that part . 
  everyone has their own concerns , ideas and * somehow * it 's all supposed to fit into a single product . 
  while not impossible , it raises costs , takes time and raises the possibility for further difficulties . 
  these and other difficulties are unlike what the us faces . 
  one product that has to do one thing and that 's it . 
  not 2-3 other nations chipping in saying `` oh we 'd also like it to do x , y and be able to do loopings ! '', 
  the engineering issues will fix themselves eventually . 
  it 's only natural * and * airbus has to stay competitive . 
  otherwise europe will do exactly what it 's doing now , just buy c-130 's from the us instead . 
  the requesition issue however , can only be fixed with a common military solution between all the larger member states . 
  ( which is at least within sight ), 
  while you are certainly right with the bad example , i 'll have to disagree on the second part . 
  israel for example , all submarines build in germany . 
  same goes for portugal ( although they have a lot of hand-me-downs . ), 
  but you can apply the same process for everything military related , really . 
  tanks , aircraft , weapons . 
  sure , but that makes the whole design worse and in the end they did n't actually safe any money from the whole thing . 
  while true , until their full objective of a mars rover was achieved , they had plenty of failed tries . 
  it 's just part of the job , unfortunately . 
   the eurofighter being extremely expensive-they cost almost as much as an f-22 what ? 
  the eurofighter is quoted [ here ] ( http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2013-07/eurofighter-anschaffung-preis ) with 93 million euros per unit . 
  even lower in other articles and [ here ] ( https://beyonddefence.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/f-35-vs-typhoon-which-costs-more/comment-page-1/ ) with 115 million euros . 
  the highest number i found so far . 
  the f-22 is quoted with us$ 150 million , as of 2010 on wikipedia , according to the us defense budget . 
  so the eurofighter is still * significantly * cheaper than an f-22 , the only problem being that everyone wanted to do their own thing with it , which raises the cost after they are bought . 
   but a good illustration of how dysfunctional the eurofighter program is is that its aesa radar has been in development for longer than the f-35 has and it still is n't ready . 
  you are probably referring to the captor-e ? 
  because the eurofighter * does * have an aesa radar , it 's called captor-m . 
  the program has been upgraded and further developed and the newest iteration , the captor-e has just begun testflights . 
  so i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  sure , but in the end you get a half-assed product that saved you money and does very little else . 
  whooow , hold on there . 
  while the idea is correct , you severely understimate the cost behind these things as well as the operational capabilities of a carrier . 
   not really `` cheaper '' , all the bribes payed and money invested into such bases like incirlik is gone . 
  who says we had to `` bribe '' anyone ? 
  and investing a bit in the base you use is common courtesy more than anything . 
  but to the meat of it , carriers are expensive . 
  very , * very * expensive . 
  from the moment you build them to the time they become operational to the point where you scrap them , they are gigantic ovens to burn your money in . 
  let 's break it down shall we . 
  the german navy would have to expanded significantly . 
  we are talking about making them the largest or close to largest teilstreitkraft . 
  they 'd also need more ships , many , many more ships . 
  much larger and with different capabilities than is currently planned . 
  all of this would mean that the budget of the bundeswehr would have to be increased by billions ( double digits ) as well as instantanous investments in the billions . 
  now , where to produce such large ships and who even has the capabilities to do so ? 
  the brits are not an option after the brexit , nor are the us as they do n't take such contract work . 
  alright , so we have to build them ourselves !, 
  shipyards have to be upgraded , perhaps even completely new ones build , technology has to be bought , researched , tested , forgotten about , declined and three times over re-approved by 30 different boards . 
  as is tradition in germany . 
  but wait !, 
  there is more ... you also need workers and engineers to build the ships !, 
  alright , the ships are being build . 
  the costs are gigantic and are most likely close to hitting triple digits by now . 
  but no matter , we want carriers . 
  for some reason . 
  - so now we need training for the troops , pilots and what do pilots need ? 
  but where to get them from ? 
  germany * really * does not want to buy from the us , airbus does not have an option , as the eurofighter naval variant is only a proposal with stobar only , a terrible system . 
  so there is only the f-35 and dassault rafale left ... so now you either buy from the us , the french ** or ** re-design everything and wait for the eurofighter naval versions and your worse carriers . 
  but no matter , finally we decided , we * are * going to buy from the french !, 
  pride is hurt , airbus is pissed but we have at least a proper aircraft !, 
  but now we also need carrier versions of everything else , as well as new equipment that the rafale can mount , pilot training , ** all ** crews need to be re-trained for rafale maintenance . 
  oh well ... more money gone . 
  hurray !,
