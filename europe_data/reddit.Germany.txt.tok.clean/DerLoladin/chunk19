  the carriers are finished , the fleet is ready , the sailors and soldiers are trained , the pilots confident and the aircraft loaded !, 
  in something that can only be described as a miracle , everything has worked , been delivered on time with only slight cost variations !, 
  now the carrier group can finally set out and after only about 20 years , we have our carriers !, 
  of course , for the all the cost involved and that are now hitting germany just to maintain those ships you could have also upgraded every tiny airstrip in israel , jordan , libanon to full-fledged military bases and probably had enough budget left to buy a long-range eurofighter to operate from cyprus . 
  or build erdogan 30 new palaces and have him be your best buddy for all time . 
  * or * we could just * not * get carriers . 
   the polish pis latest u-turn on the helicopter deal what has that to do with eurocopter ? 
  no one even understands why they backed out of the deal ...  the difficulties involved with eurofighter you mean the a400m ? 
  that 's airbus , not eurofighter . 
  and yeah , the a400m is a mess . 
  but then again it * is * a very , very special design , able to do what few other transport planes can do . 
   even esa 's lander failures which is completely normal . 
  nasa had plenty of failures as well before they got their first big success . 
  that 's simply part of the process . 
   we 've had national leaders ass-kissing saudi arabian royalty to maintain arms exports . 
  just like they have been doing before nato has existed ? 
  large countries like the us , uk , france and germany have always been boot-licking the ones who buy their weapons . 
  since centuries even . 
   everyone else has done very little to improve the mess . 
  it 's a mess that needs time to fix itself and grow . 
  how about a good example ? 
  eurocopter is building some of the best helicopters in the world , airbus some of the best aircraft ( military * and * civilian ) . 
  projekt kant will produce the next leopard for france and germany , hopefully the rest of europe will chip in . 
  so you know every monument and have a little scale with you as to what is `` ridiculous triumphalist '' and what is `` reasonable '' ? 
  aight then . 
  and ... * why * would germany want a carrier ? 
   we 're bound to the goodwill of recep `` the purge '' erdogan not really . 
  we can operate from israel , libanon , jordan and cyprus if we have to . 
  turkey just has the best and largest facilities , which make it much easier and more effective to operate from , as well as significantly cheaper . 
   but i do n't think there was ever a problem with the design aside from the constant back and forth and back and forth , making the ship bigger but less and less capable . 
  the design flaw is also in the inherent problems that come from the vtol system as well as the uk buying the * worse * f-35 version . 
  seriously , it 's like they do n't even want the best ship they can get for their money . 
  most nations are trying to fix this though , by buying from european partners instead of doing everything themselves . 
  for example , when buying submarines who do you turn to ? 
  germany most likely . 
  when buying fighter aircraft , who do you turn to ? 
  most likely france or airbus . 
  it 's much cheaper and , with proper contract drafting , more reliable than doing everything yourself from scrap . 
  the issue is , the uk likes to brag with the `` doing it ourselves ! '', 
  part , most notably with the carriers . 
  one of the points that is always mentioned with them and is apparently one of the `` great '' facts about them , is that 70 % of all parts come from the uk !, 
  wuuu ... 
   the uk has plenty of experience with carriers . 
  * had . 
  they * had * plenty of experience with carriers , which was back in the 70 's . 
  they then laid off everyone who had build them , scrapped the shipyards and sold them off . 
  they were also significantly smaller than all the other carriers around , at a mere 22,000 tons of displacement . 
  so merely 1/5th of a nimitz-class . 
  yet they wanted to build a `` super-carrier '' with the queen elizabeth-class . 
  red-red-green is a horror scenario for all of germany ... even all of europe . 
  these are three parties that can not agree on anything and will never be able to agree on anything . 
  spd and gr\u00fcne can work together under certain circumstances but there is ** no way ** this would work with die linke . 
  they are too radical and too extreme in their political views . 
  there is a reason that gregor gysi has never been in a significant office in recent times , even though he is a capable and amazing politician . 
   hat do germans/europeans think about a left-wing coalition to replace merkel ? 
  the worst-case scenario for everyone involved , simply due to the sheer incompetence of all parties . 
  the spd is a joke and can not find its own arse in the dark with a flashlight and instructions , die gr\u00fcnen are moderate and nice enough yet have no idea how to do anything as they are an opposition party and die linke are ... well ... there is a reason they are not allowed to touch anything on bundesebene . 
   there have been rumors that the current president of the ep , martin schulz , could run for the top job in germany . 
  hahahahahahahahaha right , might as well put a raccoon with rabies up there . 
  seriously , an spd candidate that no one knows or cares about , part of the more right-wing of the spd and is supposed to lead a red-red-green coalition ? 
   who is your preferred candidate ? 
  the spd simply does not have one . 
  not a single politician of the spd comes to mind who would make a good chancellor , gabriel is hopeless , schulz is a nobody . 
  for the cdu , well , i 'd love to see lammert but he is going out of active politics sooo ... i guess there is only merkel left . 
  oh and uschi ... i mean ursula von der leyen . 
  ( if she became candidate a mass suicide of cdu supporters will be observed ), 
  * no one * knows schulz . 
  there is a reason he was shuffled off to brussel . 
  the man is incompetence incarnate . 
  in his position as mod he messed up ... * big time * . 
  and in his position as minister of the interior he can watch as the german police lacks over 15.000 officers , is underequipped , underfunded ** and ** will loose 50 % of their force as they go in retirement over the next 5 years . 
  good job de maiziere . 
  that the admiral kutznetsov is a steaming piece of garbage is hardly arm-chair generaling . 
  but hey , plenty of propaganda photos to be taken !, 
  this time even without tugboats !, 
  that 's what happens if you build ships , that you do n't need and have no idea how to actually build them properly . 
  not a very good comparison , especially because mannerheim fought in ww1 for the russian empire . 
  nazi monuments ? 
  like which ones ? 
  there are still plenty of fallen soldier monuments around and i 'm certain they had fascists in them ( and communists ) . 
  that 's such a dumb and short-sighted view . 
  of course , the short-term reaction is correct , but they are also monuments to remember the past , to remember that there were foreign fascists fighting in wars they had very little to do with . 
  if all these monuments were gone , the only way you could find out about it is via books ... with plenty of people able to claim that it is `` lies '' . 
  * someone * is very full of themselves ... 
  could be me during my final french oral exam . 
  lots of staring on the table and `` uhm ... je ... uhm ... '', 
  that 's the only times when they will get off their ass , when the state will pay them a huge contract . 
  i live in berlin , the god damn ** capital !, 
  ** and can not get anything higher than 50mbit/s ( not mb/s ) , thanks telekom . 
  if they 'd offer something like 1 gb/s i might even think about putting up with their ridiculous prices and shitty customer service . 
  basf explosion was an accident , not particularly uncommon , yet tragic . 
  mars lander is european news , not specific for germany . 
  hardly international , but agreed , the talks with putin are quite important . 
  yet the issue of the `` reichsb\u00fcrger '' is more important as it highlights a specific issue that has been ignored for too long . 
  shootings and police officers dying is also always tragic and very uncommon in germany . 
  the providers * want * to lay fibre , however , they are not allowed to as telekom takes very good care that these regulations stay in place . 
  other providers have to use the already existing infrastructure , which is owned by telekom , who in turn refuse to upgrade it on a large scale . 
  telekom just bribes everyone they possibly can to keep their choke-hold on germany . 
  the company is fucking disgusting . 
  what else would they cover ?
