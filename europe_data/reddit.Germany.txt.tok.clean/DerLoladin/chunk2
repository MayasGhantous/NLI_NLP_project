  the ukrainian government also launched a criminal case against crimea 's new minister of justice , because she brands the maidan revolution a `` coup '' . 
  ( or so the bbc claims ), 
  some degree of intervention such as criminalising the act of criticising the maidan revolution ? 
  truly it is an amazingly free country ... 
  do n't forget that op 's city is absoloutly tiny . 
  2 reasons for that : 1 . 
  it has old buildings = not bombed to bits in ww2 = unimportant target/small city 2 . 
  the streets are mostly just for 1-2 cars , means small city . 
  well , not exactly rich . 
  but seems pretty well off . 
  having 2 cars and a house is insane in my mind . 
  pretty much where i 'm at . 
  but city growth wealth trickles down !, 
  right ... ? 
  he owns 2 cars and a house . 
  that 's 2 more cars than my family could ever afford and a house that one can only dream of . 
  damn , this album made me feel poor ... 
  1 minute in and i ai n't seeing any boobs . 
  racism is , by definition , also applyable to nationality . 
   sounds like you 're not aware of the 5 minutes before the jet intruded into turkish airspace . 
  source for that please , because unless i 'm misremembering the plane was warned that it was `` close '' to turkish air space but only entered it for a short amount of time . 
   because the rules of engagement changed a few years ago for those borders because it was very dangerous after that incident . 
  that matters very little . 
  i already said that legally they were perfectly right to shoot down the su-24 . 
  it is still hypocritical . 
  while unknown , it is relatively easy to establish which nation it belongs to . 
  either russian or syrian , since the rest are broadcasted to the turkish military . 
  the 2 aircraft were also conducting operations close to the border for a while , which means that turkey most likely contacted nato allies and had a pretty clear picture as to whom these jets belonged to . 
  your link is also broken . 
  it 's not that easy i 'm afraid since turkey refuses to submit flight plans while citing icao charter 1948 ( which is outdated ) and greece citing later added regulations . 
  oh i know the explanation and turkey is legally 100 % in the right to shoot down the su-24 . 
  however , here is where the bs starts . 
  the jet was in turkish airspace between 10 and 17 seconds and erdogan states he gave the order to launch a missile himself . 
  how exactly did he do that , if they were n't waiting for such an incursion ? 
  how can turkey criticise syria for shooting down one of their jets and call it a `` short-term border violation can never be pretext for an attack ! '', 
  yet do the same thing ? 
  turkey technically had the legal right to shoot the jet down . 
  yet , it has merely done so for political gain and not because they felt their borders to be violated . 
  ( edit : i would like to add that turkeys air space violations air ** much ** larger in number than those form greece . 
  in 2015 it was over 2000 , yet i could n't find reliable data against the greek side . ), 
  really ? 
  i found most people being quite aware of the ongoing violations on both sides . 
  well , they still occur , then again turkey ` claims ' a lot of airspace . 
  i know better than to dive into the topic of the russian airspace violation . . 
  yes , it was . 
  it was one of the many issues . 
  a conflict of who owns what sea border , who owns which sections of what air space and in general both turkey and greece just like to fuck with each other . 
  i also said in the post before this that greece does it as well , so stop your `` oh everyone hating on poor turkey ! '' - trip . 
  can not find a source for it right now . 
  there was a compiled list from last year which said that there were 114 violations of turkish air space , over only 1 month . 
  most of them by greek jets , but 3-4 by italians and israelis . 
  well , cyprus was a pretty big deal before that as well . 
  ca n't really have someone join the eu when they are occupying another country , can you now . 
  ( from a political perspective , makes for rather bad press ) airspaces are relevant when you have an ongoing conflict between 2 or more countries ( and let 's be honest , greece is just as asshol-ish about it as turkey ) but they are trying to fit into the same closet . 
  italy is also violating turkish air space from time to time and the other way around . 
  it 's not a prevalent as with greece though . 
  cyprus is a member since 2008 , with the conflict still unresolved . 
  thus you still have an occupational zone , which rightfully belongs to cyprus , yet is threatened by the turkish military should they make any effort to reclaim it . 
  did i mention the ongoing airspace violations of eu member states such as greece and italy ? 
  apples and oranges . 
  western germany has been a nato member since its creation and is the central hub for training and operations in middle europe for nato . 
  watchout for that edge !, 
  oh , nevermind , too late ... 
  so poland wants a political tool that others should pay for . 
  yeah no . 
  for now , the qrf is more than enough , poland is very well protected with plenty of states ready to support them and the other baltic states . 
  cyprus first and now erdogan . 
  these are the main reasons . 
  sorry , but becoming an eu member while occupying another one illegaly is ... well , not likely . 
  he even said on tv that this is illegal in germany . 
  nope , i just prefer actually reading articles before judging them . 
  not again this topic . 
  every time its posted it triggers nationalistic poles left and right ( mostly right these days ) . 
  sure you are ... 
  feels like the greens are the only ones left with a bit of common sense . 
  not to say they do n't have some bs ideas , but so far they make a pretty good opposition . 
  hungary needs more lebensraum . 
  it 's anschluss-time !, 
  weird , so does the rest of europe and they seem to be able to do it . 
  so , instead of improving the system and turning at around into a more socially orientated state ( plenty of good examples in the eu ) poland resorts to righty-tightys with just a little sprinkle of fascism in there ? 
  well splendid !, 
  that sounds like an amazing plan to improve the lifes of everyone ... 
  god damn if you would n't be as hilarious as you are , i might even feel pity for you . 
  you seem to have no grasp for history , no idea what the eu and nato are actively doing for poland . 
  right , they were only threatened by starvation , domestic terrorism , thrown into prison for saying the wrong thing to the wrong person . 
  ah , the good old times , am i right ? 
  nah , you do n't want to leave . 
  from the sound of what you are saying you want to go back in time , dat warsaw pact though !, 
  oh poland was the greatest place to ** not ** be !, 
  that 's just sad, 
  not the eu 's problem that your government does n't work properly . 
  but if you decide to go the whole `` yeh , fuck democracy ! '', 
  while part of a union that has democracy as an obligation for joining , do n't be surprised if the book gets thrown at you . 
  hitler argument , abandon comment !, 
  abandon comment !, 
  that 's like saying that mao or stalin were all amazing supporters of democracy . 
  care to give an example ? 
  unless you are part of a larger group which has a certain rule set that you are breaking . 
  `` we did n't get our fancy missile system !, 
  russia would have been so much better ! '',
