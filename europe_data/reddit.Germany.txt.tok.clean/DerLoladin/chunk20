  this is ** the ** news in germany as of now , which will hopefully make the state take these lunatics more serious . 
  yeah , * back then * they did not want a us military presence . 
  it 's been just a few decades . 
  source, 
  not quite sure which schools you went to , but from my experience ( which is a merry trip through the entire german school system ) you definitly do not learn discipline in a school . 
  perhaps you acquire it in something * related * to school , a sports club or another activity . 
  but the days of teaching `` discipline and order ! '', 
  in schools are long past . 
  last time i checked most working environments have such `` distractions '' as well . 
  so unless you want to ban women from working as well ... oh hey there saudi arabia . 
  language is pretty similiar already anyways . 
  you can not civil contract everything . 
  you can do so for certain aspects in offices but a helicopter repair crew * has * to be military . 
  for multiple reasons , including being deployable everywhere , being able to work under stressful conditions , being much cheaper than civil contractors and so on . 
  gate security is already a stretch , but understandable . 
  so is the office stuff ( they do n't have acess to any information regarding the soldiers themselves . ), 
  so you are against un intervention and would like to ignore cries for help from other governments because * you * do not support or understand the reasons behind such interventions ? 
  good thing there are many more who will not let governments of smaller countries stand alone or sit idle while a terrorist state is in the making . 
  yet yugoslavia was not a `` war of aggression '' in that sense . 
  nor do i think that it 's an example that can be applied across nato as it was under very special circumstances - i 'm certain we also could argue that the un would have intervened , had the russian veto not existed . 
  and as you might have noticed , not everyone participated . 
  unlike article 5 , nato can organise such things but no one is bound to actually partake . 
  downsizing * is * a huge issue . 
  already the marine has far too few soldiers to man all their ships and is almost unable to sustain operation , the other branches do n't have enough troops for training operations and proper rotations . 
  personnel is lacking in every part of the military , from combat troops to helicopter repair crew . 
  the de-construction or rather , `` downsizing '' of the bundeswehr started long before guttenberg . 
  the bundeswehr was under every minister told to do more with much less . 
  both in soldiers , funds and material . 
  what we have now is only a symptom of this process and has been long in the making . 
  guttenberg is certainly guilty for his share , but in comparison to the overall situation it 's a small part . 
  nato will never wage any `` war of aggression '' , that is why it 's a defensive alliance . 
  and why article 5 can only be invoked when a member is attacked * first * . 
  aside from that , [ artikel 24 ( 2 ) ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_24.html ) specifies our involvement in nato , eu and un . 
  an important sidenote , which is not mentioned on that ( unofficial ) website is that every troop deployment has to be authorised by the parlament , ** unless ** we are at war . 
  but that 's why we have a parlamentsarmee and nothing else . 
  you do realise any action taken as part of the eu , un or nato is fully legal and part of our grundgesetz ? 
  it has been for a long , long time too . 
  germany is a world-leading state and has certain responsibilities as such . 
  you ca n't cherry-pick everything - you want to be part of the un and contribute to world peace and stabilisation in unstable parts ? 
  well , then you also got ta commit troops to such an endeavor . 
  or do you think flowers will convince them ? 
  the `` mess '' was started long before guttenberg 's time . 
  that the man was n't particularly good at his job is certain , but then again he also had to leave much sooner than expected . 
  de maiziere is just incompetence incarnate , even now as minister of the interior he is a fumbling idiot . 
  honestly , i do n't think there is a single politician that i hate much more and i 'm saying that , well aware of the existence of heiko maas , dr. wagenknecht , frauke petry and renate k\u00fcnast . 
  uhm , no . 
  definitly not . 
  most germans are well aware that they need their military and quite like it , they just do n't like it being used in some backwater middle eastern state . 
  ( nor do the americans , for that matter ), 
  being slightly more competent than thomas de maizi\u00e8re is like saying you can run faster than your toddler . 
  * anyone * can do it . 
  hell , my dog is more competent . 
  but you are right , unfortunately she has also brought the 42h-week upon the bundeswehr . 
  for my own sanity i will pretend you are actually interested . 
  aight , how and why is mali relevant for the eu . 
  first of , the eu mission in mali did not start out as such , but rather as a french involvment in response to a call for help from the government of mali . 
  a coup d'\u00e9tat happened and a group , called the mnla were seeking independence for their [ northern region ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/northern_mali_conflict.svg ) ( mostly desert ) . 
  this was not ground for any international involvement , however , the mnla was backed by islamist and jihadi groups which began to de-throne the mnla in the north and took over completely soon after ( the mnla lost the war against them ) . 
  now , a independent mnla controlled north might have been bad , but a terrorist state ( backed by al-quaeda as well ) right in north africa with a huge border to niger , algeria and so on ? 
  * fuck no * . 
  so the call for help to retake the north went out , france answered as well as the african union . 
  this counter-offensive began in january 2013 and ended in february 2013 , with all territories retaken . 
  around the same time the eu began eutm mali , a training mission to train the fresh recruits of the malinese military how to deal with insurgents , spot and disable ied 's and generally train them to be able to defend mali themselves . 
  a peace treaty was signed the same year , with the touareg rebels ( mnla ) withdrawing from it later , fighting continued with both the touareg and the islamist and jihadi insurgents . 
  the same year the un passed a resolution for stabilisation and to support the peace process in mali , minusma . 
  the netherlands joined up soon after , supporting the french troops still conducting operations against insurgents . 
  germany joined also in 2013 , but a bit later and in smaller scale , stepping up the commitment recently to support the dutch troops and take over the stabilisation process as french troops are scheduled to withdraw from mali . 
  now * why * is mali essential for europe ? 
  mali was once a very stable country and an anchor for the region . 
  it is important to return to that , otherwise the refugee flood from that region and the destabilisation following a rogue state/failed state might very well shatter algeria and open the gates to europe . 
  ( edit : a word ), 
  plenty of military operations ongoing that nato is not involved in . 
  nor ever will be . 
  for example , mali . 
   they 're buying the ` reaper ' armed uav false . 
  germany * wanted * to buy the heron from israel and now has to re-do the whole process because gd complained about unfair contract distribution . 
  aside from that the luftwaffe is buying a few c130 's in cooperation with france . 
  weird , i thought homosexuals still could not get legally married and adopt children . 
  or that most of our states do n't even care about right-wing extremists . 
  so leftist though !, 
  right , how could i think that a * union * as in `` european union '' might be something that everyone should partake and help one another out . 
  together we are stronger and all that . 
  but sure , i 'm just a `` random retard '' - thanks for the non-existing argument by the way . 
  soooo ... you want a solution to the amount of people flodding into greece and italy . 
  eastern europeans say `` nah fuck that '' and germany then decides to do it by themselves via the turkey deal ... and now you complain about that too . 
  please , make up your mind . 
   you welcomed them and made more come lol alright then  i never saw you wanting to find a common solution with the rest of us to stop the ibflow and to help greece and italy out . 
  really ? 
  weird , i was under the impression there was something called the `` turkey deal '' ... 
  but right , we 're all just a bunch of hypocrites who screamed '' * please all come to germany !, 
  like right now !, 
  * '' ca n't make this shit up ... 
  and in the same swipe also making greece fall flat on its face ( again ) and having it crash fully . 
  italy as well . 
  the euro is now dropping even more , inflation is rising and you have a large amount of people stuck in greece and italy ripe for radicalization in their desperation . 
  congratulations , you have achieved exactly nothing and made the whole situation worse than it was before . 
  spd will keep quit about it , they were the ones who messed up in the first place and have no room to throw any stones in that regard . 
  greens will likely not say anything about it either , since they might become a coalition partner for the cdu in the next election . 
  and die linke is crying about everything short of dismantling the bundeswehr anyways . 
  highly doubt that .
