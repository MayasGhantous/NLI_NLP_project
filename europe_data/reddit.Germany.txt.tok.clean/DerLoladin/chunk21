  die zeit is already pretty liberal , not as left as spiegel , sure , but even der spiegel called for more funds for the military . 
  wait , shipping illegal immigrants back to their countries is * not * a process that needs to be faster ? 
  well i be damned , all our problems are taken care of . 
  it 's not like there are hundreds of thousands of other refugees and/or immigrants strewn across europe . 
  some have already gone into hiding , other are not even registered yet . 
  yeah there is definitly no reason why all countries might want to work together on that process , none at all ... 
  saying `` hey , we 'd like to finally fix our military ... maybe ! '', 
  is suddenly `` militarist rhetoric '' ? 
  are you serious ? 
  even the left-wing media is making fun of the military and complaining about how insanely underfunded they are . 
  unfortunately that is the thing you need to move up on the political ladder . 
  you get the word around with pictures of yourself next to some new tech . 
  be it a new tank , plane , gun ... old stuff that is * finally working properly * only brings in `` ugh , finally !, 
  '' - comments . 
  at some times its superiority , then its inferiority , then it 's guilt syndrom ... can you make a decision already ? 
  fact is that , instead of working together and making the process much faster for all of europe * some nations * hammered their foot down and kept crying `` eu solution ? 
  i hate the eu !, 
  see ? 
  i 'm just gon na take a big shit on the carpet now and elect some retarded populist-right governments ! '', 
  yeah , yeah . 
  i 'll believe it when i see it more nato commitment and more money for the military is always a nice thing to say , but actually putting the money down is where they stop . 
  not a generalisation but a fact . 
  just like any culture has certain negative and positive aspects , so do arabs . 
  or is that suddenly racist ? 
  sure !, 
  it can ... i mean , * will * totally still happen !, 
  `` too little , too late '' is neither a legitimate concern in this discussion nor does it contribute anything . 
  oh hey poland . 
  what about those refugees and immigrants , want to take some ? 
  okay , then get right off your imaginery moral high ground . 
  oh boy the world is gon na end in , like , 2 years from now because of all these immigrants !, 
  oooooh boy !, 
  you just watch it !, 
  2018 is gon na be the year we have to get to mars !, 
   in germany the equivalent terms -- gesinnungsethik and verantwortungsethik -- are household words . 
  uhm ... what ? 
  there is no culture being replaced . 
  last i checked i was n't a muslim , turned eastern european , ate bortsch all day or praised allah . 
  quite the contrary , the people immigrating rather turn away from these `` cultural values '' or whatever you want to call them . 
  so yeah , can people please stop talking about some kind of `` cultural genocide '' or `` cultural replacement '' ? 
  it * ai n't fucking happening you populistic fuckwits *, 
  oh good , well then we do n't have to worry about `` cultural evolution '' - 'cause that is what you are talking about , not genocide . 
  you are of course right , apologies . 
  let 's take a look at what a `` cultural genocide '' actually is . 
   it involves the eradication and destruction of cultural artifacts , such as books , artworks , and structures , and the suppression of cultural activities that do not conform to the destroyer 's notion of what is appropriate . 
  motives may include the religious ( e.g. , iconoclasm ) , as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing to remove the evidence of a people from a locale or history , as part of an effort to implement a year zero , in which the past and its associated culture is deleted and history is `` reset '' , the suppression of an indigenous culture by invaders and colonisers , along with many other potential reasons . 
  there are only two regions on earth where i would consider the use of `` cultural genocide '' appropriate , that is in the areas of isis * and * china in tibet . 
  using it in a european context is utterly ridiculous . 
  aaah alright , so you just generally hate and despise all immigrants that are not white and conform with your world view of white supremacy . 
  simple , his statement makes it seem as if the european financial and political elite somehow `` imported '' refugees and immigrants from other continents . 
  when in reality , the refugees would have come one way or another , that 's why they are refugees ... 
  dat generalism , * dayumn son * . 
  'cause all eastern europeans are racists ( like you ) and all people from the middle east see women as property and ask for the death penalty . 
  oh i am aware , i was more referring to someone from poland making a sarcastic comment about refugees . 
  can i smack you with some books about history ? 
  as well as some historical facts and context ? 
  it 's very important that you understand fundemental basic rights , like `` self determination '' . 
  since it 's a parasite and you acknowledge it as such , abstinence is not the problem solver . 
  if shit happens we have both the technology as well as the means to remove the parasite , so as you said , no problem at all . 
  why wait ? 
  i 'm not waiting if i have a parasite inside of me , nor am i obligated to care for said parasite once it has left my body . 
   fetus has a different blood type and dna.its not your body . 
  so it 's a parasite ? 
  oh good !, 
  then you can just have it removed like any other parasite , 
  hmm , beef in mint sauce, 
  but do you pay taxes ? 
  holy shit dat apologism . 
  there is a housing crisis and that is most definitly * not * due to any asylum seekers or refugees . 
  anyone who actually believes that shit is beyond any help that can be offered . 
  right i always seem to forget that everyone who does n't scream '' ** hail putin !, 
  ** '' is an evil , facist russophobe !, 
   there is nothing to discuss with you people thanks for agreeing with me then . 
  i will link this conversation to some russian friends and others who might be on the fence of propaganda , 
  and that is exactly what i meant with the `` us vs. 
  them '' mentality . 
  i 've got nothing against russia , russians or their culture . 
  quite the contrary i have been multiple times to russia and invited friends over from russia . 
  so do n't give me that kinda attitude . 
  i asked you a simple question , whether you are able to deny those facts that i have stated in my previous answer . 
  they got nothing to do with any kind of `` values '' or `` teachings '' , just simple facts . 
  no , most people most likely do not have a `` free mind '' but in a very different sense than your apparent understanding . 
  for example , the would be an uproar across the country if camera footage popped up , showing election workers stuff voting papers into ballot boxes . 
  there is an inquiry , even sentencing for people who openly publish hate against certain groups . 
  there is a clear line to what country belongs to whom , which areas to which nation and so on . 
  do you see all these things as given in russia as well ? 
  because if you do , i might have some very bad news for you ... 
   you people uhm okay  you people alright , so what exactly means `` you people '' ? 
  people from the west ? 
  people who dislike lies and blatant hate being spread throughout a population for no reason other than indoctrination ? 
  both russian propaganda and a general dislike of the west ( only real slavs will understand !, 
  ! 1 ! 1 ) are a large part of it , sadly . 
  yeh because the whole area was just ** peachy ** before that . 
  no problems there ... 
  the culinary choices will improve vastly in that region . 
  sources - otherwise , bull-fucking-shit, 
  uhm , there was never any invasion in afghanistan and libya . 
  afghanistan was a ** call for help ** from the afghan government and libya was never `` invaded '' as there were never any ground troops . 
  i know reality is harsh , but let 's cover your other examples . 
   panama us , not nato , not europe  granada us , not nato , not europe  cuba i guess you mean bay of pigs , again , us not nato or even any european state  egypt god damn you are reaching far back in time .
