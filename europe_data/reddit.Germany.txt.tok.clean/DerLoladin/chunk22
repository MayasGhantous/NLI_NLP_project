  but hey , this is at least your first real invasion with european powers !, 
  it kinda was initiated by israel and it was 1956 but oh well ...  yugoslavia that was an invasion ? 
  ** hahahahaha ** aside from the fact that the uno authorised all military action you mean ? 
   vietnam oh you mean that war that the us fought without any european states participating ? 
  i 'm * still * waiting for examples involving the eu ... or nato ... 
   the afd has none . 
  how would they have any in parliament ** without elections ** ?!, 
  it 's like talking to a 5 year old . 
   again , no fear mongering at all , a totally realistic projection . 
  thanks , glad that you can get a grip on the modern ways of warfare and how russia is currently the number one when it comes to arming seperatist and paramilitary movements within other countries . 
   ukraine is not in nato or the eu , so it 's a completely irrelevant example in our discussion . 
   that are won by little green men . 
  ** fought ** for fucks sake . 
   did you just get an attack or what ? 
  read your own post , then come back . 
  you might notice that there is another paragraph that mentioned `` that perfectly worked in afghanistan for example . '', 
  seriously , if you 're forgetting about half the shit you wrote , you might not be fit for a debate . 
   plus france , you have 90 % of nato lol right then . 
  aside from the fact that the british people demand no military action being taken [ without parliament approval , which would extend to article 5 ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/10/25/report-british-attitudes-defence-security-and-arme/ ) or that the potential next us president wo n't give two shits about nato . 
  but sure , 90 %, 
   hat would be relevant if article 5 needed parliaments approval to be triggered . 
  but it does n't . 
  and yet parliaments still talk about as to uphold democracy . 
   so suddenly germany and france have parliaments with a pro-russian majority who ever mentioned a majority ? 
  i said `` opposition '' , not majority . 
  get your eyes checked . 
   and what paramilitary threat are you talking about ? 
  the threat of both far-left and far-right extremists being armed by russia in case of a war , to create a `` homefront '' . 
   if i look up german military history elsass-lothringen has always been a contest between prussia/germany and france . 
  just like russia has always seeked a natural baltic seaport . 
  or , you know , how they annexed a pretty substantial part of ukraine for the seaport there . 
   hello , this is 2016 and even in 2016 large-scale conflicts are still won by armies . 
  who consist of soldiers . 
  more soldiers + modern equipment = better protection against threats . 
  less soldiers + modern equipment = worse protection . 
  my god that was difficult ...  we were able to defeat and occupy a country thousands of kilometers away what are you even talking about ? 
  afghanistan or iraq ? 
  if you try to compare russia to afghanistan than you are just flat out retarded and no one can help you , i 'm afraid . 
  if you compare russia to iraq then you will find that the us was the main-factor during that invasion . 
   use some common sense and look at facts * right * , facts like the fact that the french population has allways been a strong supporter of their military , unlike in other european nations ? 
  or the facts that what i mentioned is the truth and a large part of a decision . 
  ( guess why some countries did n't participate in the iraqi invasion , weird right ? ), 
  but sure , apply france to every nation in europe . 
  because that makes sense ... for fucks sake . . 
   what greater impact are you talking about ? 
  the greater impact of multiple , large political parties directly supporting russia . 
  in germany alone there is `` die linke '' and the afd , both most likely with very high results in the upcoming election . 
  in france it 's front national with strong ties to russia . 
  in a potential conflict with russia europe might run into strong opposition in their parlaments when trying to take action . 
   why would it have any effect on the decision makers ? 
  because now you not only have very little support for such a conflict at home but also a potential paramilitary threat . 
   yeah , this port will make russia great again , sure that 's worth it . 
  look up russian military history and the history of their conflicts . 
   a shit show that guarenteed the security of its members for 67 years . 
  well , back then only a few hundred thousand troops protected the border to the soviet satellite states . 
   nato has 10 times the military budget of russia right ? 
  do i have to explain why that matters very little when you have dozens of splintered nations , all buying their own shit , training their own soldiers and speaking their own language ** and ** paying significantly more in salaries than russia . 
  it 's such a stupid and retarded argument that im hearing over and over again recited by left-wingers with no education in military matters . 
   nato leaders follow rt to get their informations nato leaders are what again ? 
  correct , heads of state . 
  what is important to heads of state ? 
  public perception . 
  what tanks public perception ? 
  when you act against the `` truth '' that people are led to believe . 
  use some common sense please . 
  ah alright , debate with you is pointless as you refuse to see the greater impact of things . 
  have a nice day . 
  so official [ definitions ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/invasion ) to you ? 
  why that is interesting . 
   noun 1 . an act or instance of invading or entering as an enemy , especially by an army . 
  back during the cold war you could be certain that nations would follow the commitment , but in a time of rt news flooding across europe , russian propaganda being incredibly popular on social media and a divided europe that is otherwise occupied with problems ? 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  oh so we have come from the eu invading a nation turning to russia , to invasions by the eu in general and now the west in general . 
  you notice something ? 
   that does n't make them non-invasions . 
  2/3 of your so called `` examples '' are not invasions by ** any ** definition . 
  please get a grip . 
  it 's enough that russia is threatening war and invasion against eu and nato member states . 
  so not an `` easy fear '' but reality . 
  taking action in north africa and the middle east is detrimental to the security of the eu as a whole , an eu army making such efforts much more efficent . 
  again , not an easy fear but cold logic . 
   iraq not eu related  afghanistan not an invasion  libya action taken by nato and the eu as a response to the slaughter of the civilians by the gaddafi regime . 
  also approved by the un . 
  edit : also not an invasion  we keep funding and arming groups opposed to the government in syria . 
  false . 
  the eu is arming and funding kurdish military organisation , like the peschmerga , not opposed to the government of syria . 
  actions taken by eu also under the screen of the un . 
  please , keep 'em coming . 
  i 'm still waiting for a country that the eu invaded or threatened with invasion if they began to deal with russia . 
   that 's the reason you give me ? 
  yes . 
  and a legitimate one at that . 
   and if nato does n't react , it 's the end of nato , period . 
  no country will trust the treaty and that 'll be the end of it . 
  nato is already a shit-show with turkey unable to un-fuck itself the last few years and most of europe cruising along saying `` 2 % military spending ? 
  nah fuck that ... ''  and the rest of nato members will listen to estonia , not the propaganda of the main enemy of nato . 
  riiight , and now take a look at how many people believe the propaganda that rt is spreading while covering as a legit news outfit . 
  it 's all over europe . 
  france , germany , britain , sweden ... you name it !, 
  do you know this ?
