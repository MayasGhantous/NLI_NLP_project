  it 's not as easy to explain but i 'll try . 
  southern europeans are much more uncoordinated , both in their daily lives , commuting and while working . 
  coupled with other factors this made me feel like it 's all very inefficent , there is no `` order '' to it . 
  while this might be funny coming from a german this inefficency is a crucial part i feel . 
  furthermore , and i 've had this experience both in spain and greece especially less so in italy , the attitudes towards getting shit done and fixing things are . . well , less enthusiastic . 
  mostly answered with `` eh , someone else will do it . '', 
  or `` why me ? 
  let the government do it ! '', 
  when their house is pretty much a ruin . 
  mentioned it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53sk8p/austerity_only_benefits_germany_and_destroys/d7w5oce ) - if you were not the same person i answered with that comment , my apologies . 
  ever since i have sparked an interest in politics , it has been my dream that one day we might have a true `` united europe '' . 
  while i am far from knowledgable on financial matters and thus can not explore the other reasons as to why southern europe suffers so much on a financial level , i have been in most of those states and while the people are lovely their attitudes towards certain things are ... odd to say the least . 
  i hope we will see a fiscal union one day just like i hope to see all of europe flourish one day . 
   you ca n't blame southern europe 's structural faults on these three things . 
  my good how often do i have to repeat myself . 
  i am ** not ** blaming southern europes issues on these three things alone , merely saying that they are ** contributing ** to the problems that southern europe is facing . 
  and whattaboutism is not gon na get you anywhere . 
  not sure why i 'd be `` self loathing '' or a `` rural pleb '' . 
  but sure , why not . 
  another piece of anecdotal evidence . 
  there were once rumors of a wolf pack close-ish to my grandmothers village when i was visiting for a week . 
  suddenly the neighbours dog was n't hit by car 2 days ago , no , it was eaten by the wolves !, 
  and the farmer next village did n't loose a cow because of age , but the wolves got it !, 
  man , those wolves were a * real * threat there . 
  damn . 
  right , because people a shackled to the place they are born at and can not move house or travel * at all * . 
   fucking inferiority complex ... 
  same thing you hear from southern europe again and again . 
  `` oh no we did n't do anything wrong !, 
  it was * them * that made this happen ! '', 
   it 's not necessary to have huge numbers of wolves . 
  as i said before , and now again , it 's not about `` huge numbers of wolves '' but rather a healthy population that can sustain itself without causing inbreeding and degradation of the dna . 
  exterminating 70-80 % of a population causes exactly that to happen . 
   especially for purely conservational reasons as i have explained before , it is not for conservational reasons . 
  also , bears and even boars are known to attack and eat children in dire times . 
  so why not exterminate them as well ? 
  there is literally no difference in your arguments . 
   a dangerous predator but one that can be managed - and how measures can be taken , including hunting . 
  i never said i 'm against wolves being hunted . 
  merely that i disagree with the notion of * why * they should be hunted and that it boggles my mind how one could think it 's a good idea for an ecosystem to exterminate the main predator . 
  like , this is biology 101 and i was shit in those classes . 
   they eat children if given the chance . 
  i did . 
  they eat children not when given the chance but when food is short ( due to unrestricted hunting or a natural disaster ) or when inflicted by rabies . 
  i disagree . 
  a `` we 're not gon na change anything before ... '' attitude was a bit contributing factor for greece 's dilemma . 
  i 'm not trying to make this a single-cause issue . 
  anyone with a bit of insight will be able to put the pieces together that led to this situation . 
  and yes , the european financial structure has to change * but * so does the southern european culture in some regards . 
  however , any structural change will most likely be taking big steps towards federalisation , something that the v4 will block all day every day . 
  thank you for your insightful contribution . 
  that 's not what it 's about . 
  the southern european nations , greece , spain and italy all share a common problem in politics and cultural attitudes . 
  a dislike of taxes , looking down upon `` hard working business owners '' ( for the lack of a better word ) as well as corruption . 
  while these things are less common in italy , they are still there and keep holding the country back . 
  this paragraph makes no sense . 
  omg germans ruined greece !, 
  greeks are innocent poor poor people that got fucked out of nowhere by evil nazi-fascist germany !!, 
  omfg ( / s ), 
  well , then the southern european states better get their shit together . 
  damn dude , you got some kind of specific hate of wolves . 
  read your study again . 
  just with a pair of glasses this time around . 
  now go ahead and read 11.1 or page 12 section 7 . 
  but thanks for the source anyways !, 
  this is great stuff to show to those able to read and are unsure about wolf attacks and to prove that wolves are only really a threat in folk tales . 
  table 9 says * nothing * about wolf attacks but rather is about domestic dogs , hybrids and captive wolves . 
  also , you do n't `` induce fear of humans '' by hunting . 
  humans are in and of itself predators themselves and wolves do not prey on larger predators usually . 
  the risk of injury is too great and the reward is too small . 
  as i said , believing wolves are responsible for a large amount of killings and damage to livestock is utterly retarded - your study proves me right . 
  ( table 11.1 ), 
  riiight , i `` hate '' rural people because they exaggerate the problems caused by an essential predatorial species . 
  as i said , i 'm still waiting for proof that a wolf has been responsible for killing anyone . 
  we have around the same population in germany , which has a much , ** much ** denser population , yet no one has been killed or needs to be armed . 
  but please , i 'm still waiting for facts and sources rather than `` omg y u hate rurals ! '', 
  opinions . 
  sorry but i do n't trust rural people when it comes to wolves and bears . 
  little anecdote , when there was a single bear sighted in germany , suddenly every dog that went missing , every cattle that died was due to a `` bear attack '' . 
  so i do n't give 2 fucks what people claim until it is proven . 
  last i checked wolves do not only feed on reindeer . 
  dogs are the dumbest animals when it comes to wildlife , they get killed by wild boars in my area all the time , yet no one calls for their extermination . 
  and considering how few wolves there are in norway i 'd like to see a single ( proper ) article that says a child has been killed . 
  considering the large reindeer populations in norway and sweden , i doubt that the losses are very significant considering the small number of wolves . 
  you are a citizen of that country and are partly responsible for the actions of your politicians . 
  just like they are partly responsible for the actions of their electorate . 
  oh please , rural people are well known to exaggerate any predatorial `` issues '' massively as to be compensated more by the state . 
  not in norway , that 's for sure . 
  the population is * way * too small for that . 
  the western world is currently the most developed and furthest progressed . 
  that is a fact and not an opinion . 
  did we have a period of highly-developed nations in the middle east during the rein of the ottoman empire ? 
  yeah , definitly . 
  but even their scientific prowess is the same as in other nations . 
  their ruling system was the exact same , the only things different were the laws and even those were not all that different . 
  the islam is stuck in the past and most likely wo n't be able to move forward without a reform . 
  the religion itself , its laws and guidance just are not competitive enough to stay alive in a world that is turning away from religion . 
  uhm , you might want to rethink that and the whole ` progression ' part . 
  it 's very well established that the romans had progressed further than the germanic tribes , for example . 
  sure but the franco-german brigade is split 50/50 between germany and france .
