  from my experience working and talking with french people , they are great and very spirited , but their english is awful . 
  which , as i 've been told , has partly to do with a lack of proper education in the english language . 
  should have clarified - a common language in military communication . 
  ah yes , thanks for the sources showing that i 'm totally wrong and the eu is growing completely unimportant to people . 
  well , this argument is pretty much over , but thanks for the applause  have a nice day, 
  so the eu hq should be decided on who has the biggest military ? 
  really ? 
  with that sorta argument the eu parlament should move to whoever has the most political power - hey there germany ... 
  compare the numbers from the 60 's or 80 's to [ these ] ( http://www.debatingeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/european-identity011.png ) or perhaps [ these ] ( http://whatukthinks.org/eu/eu-questions/do-you-feel-you-are-a-citizen-of-eu/ ) . 
  what you will find is an ever increasing trend towards the eu and away from national identity being the defining factor . 
  while such heritage will never be forgotten and the culture will stay as well , the eu is growing in importance . 
  but yeah , all just from my `` crystal ball '' and not at all the reality of things ... 
  reality is just that . 
  reality . 
  do n't worry , already gathered as much from your previous comments . 
  english is to become * the * language inside the eu . 
  everyone speaks it , everyone likes it . 
  it 's already essential in cooperation between european militaries . 
  france actively battles the influence of the english language , having the headquarters in a french city gives them influence over the development of the official language . 
  next up is the centralisation of control and , especially in military matters , the speed of communication . 
  the `` cookie '' argument is also not completely unfair but less of a big deal for me , as i do n't really care . 
  yes , a ** proposal ** . 
  do i have to explain what that means ? 
  just like the v4 are probably putting together a ** proposal ** . 
  both will be discussed , potential changes will be noted , compromises will be made so that everyone can walk away happy . 
  the security situation is changing and most countries will not be able to defend themselves should nato ever kick the bucket . 
  that 's why it is important that europe starts to look out for itself and also why it 's the best choice from a military perspective . 
  but please , if you 'd like to argue from your own experience and interactions with officers from all over the eu , go ahead . 
   that sounds a tesny tiny bit like brainwashing it 's called `` changing times '' . 
  fact is , the eu is most likely here to stay and so will the sentiment towards it . 
  while there is currently still a generation that has much closer ties to their national identity , this will change over 2-3 generations to a much closer association with the eu . 
  who are the `` big boys '' exactly ? 
  the netherlands and belgians who love this idea ? 
  or the polish who have already expressed their interest in a closer cooperation in military matters ? 
  or the baltic states that are going to suck this up like it 's the cure for communism ? 
  this is a logical step and will be an opt-in move . 
  if your nation does not wish to join in then , well , good luck . 
  this is a question for conscripts , a practice that most modern nations are moving away from . 
  * if * we 'd be in a scenario where conscript service would have to be put back into action then you bet that the people will be willing at that point . 
  i 'm certain that , should such plans for a unified military move forward , there will be more than just one of such an institution . 
  the only way to move forward at all is with a common language , which will always end up being english . 
  the french are the most rigorous opponents to this change . 
  putting the eu military hq on french soil is very counter-productive for this development , imo anyways . 
  no thanks . 
  belgium is perfectly fine - putting it in a french city will cause more issues than it has benefits . 
  this is a plan put together by * all * member states . 
  not only the pro-federalisation states but also those sceptical ones like the v4 . 
  and i 'll bet that you 'll see a large discrepancy from west to east when it comes to a unified military . 
  who is talking about an `` eu army '' ? 
  first of all it 'd be a `` eu military '' and currently there are only talks about unifying the procedures and making europe as a whole more capable to defend itself . 
  not just estonia , or greece but the eu . 
  these are small baby steps towards the larger goal , but that wo n't be happening for a long time . 
  until then a generation will have taken over that knows nothing but the eu and will act much more favorably towards a unified military . 
  mind you , any intelligent officer without a political agenda will tell you that a closer cooperation between the member states is the only way forward . 
  this is for the headquarters . 
  read again , ** headquarters ** so the equivalent of the pentagon . 
  and not some base with a few soldiers strudding about . 
  right i forgot ... the armenian genocide never happened, 
  yeah all those children , women and villages . 
  armed to the teeth !, 
  that 's also why there was such fierce resistance fighting ... oh no wait ... there was n't . . 
  and if they dare to do so in another country then ... well , we just march right in there !, 
  definitely is . 
  look it up in a dictionary, 
   it 's bad because in my opinion it 's just a word used to promote less whiteness . 
  sure , by certain parties , individuals and news pages . 
  but not by a proper media outlet , unless it 's some columnist . 
   that 's pretty much exactly what diversity erases , culture . 
  very , very false . 
  you see diversity as something that replaces a with b , when instead you idealy want to assimmilate the best parts of b into a. 
  thus creating a1 . 
  how do you think countries and their populations have evolved ? 
  here is an example , prussia was a shithole in the 16th century - so backwater that no one with any sense would come near it . 
  until the french expelled immigrants arrived and turned prussia into one of the most modern , leading nations in europe . 
  did they all suddenly turn into french people or adopted the french culture ? 
  hell no . 
  but they assimimilated into the population . 
   is that it ? 
  that 's how i viewed and interpreted it in view of the previous comment . 
   encouraging `` diversity '' what 's so bad about that ? 
  diversity in population as well as a branching culture is already found in every country on earth . 
  or is everyone , wherever you are from , the exact same in the north as in the south ? 
   i did n't say anti-white . 
  really ? 
  let 's see  which is essentially just less white in my opinion odd . 
   the comment i responded to implied that mainstream right ( not even extreme right ) jacked off to the thought of ethnic cleansing and race war . 
  nope , he made a comment in regards to how the `` alt right '' is different from the mainstream right . 
  alt rights tend to mingle with extremists , facists and neo nazi culture quite a lot while the mainstream right is mostly made up of conservatives . 
  you must be reading some very strange `` mainstream left '' media or been talking to extreme leftists who dub themselves `` mainstream '' . 
  i tend to read and talk to people of diverse political leanings and opinions while reading both left and right leaning media - and while you can certainly see the different attitudes when it comes to immigration , no one is `` anti-white '' or some bullshit . 
   ah yes , people 's opinions can be resumed with a few simple words that can vary from extreme left / left / right / extreme right . 
  claiming your previous comment `` as opposed to mainstream left who does n't enjoy seeing too much white people in their country ? '', 
  does not make such an assumption . 
  nope , just when they use logic gymnastics and then go ahead and claim that the `` mainstream left '' does n't enjoy too many white people in their country . 
  because the alt right is such a * lovely * bunch, 
  see here is a perfect specimen of that alt right/extreme right, 
  thank you for your insight and well-researched opinion on the topic . 
  oh so just like all the other european nations ... small side note : france only has 20.000 more active personell , and that is without and treaties limiting them , 
  this is reddit . 
  people here are even less competent or informed than your eu representative .
