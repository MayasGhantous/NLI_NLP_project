   ( we use more american equipment , and can trust americans more , and do n't like european defense industry ) is that so ? 
  [ funny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equipment_of_the_royal_netherlands_army ) you should say that , using almost exclusively european military products and a canadian rifle ... 
  false , the first 10 % of produced rifles had a plastic mixture that caused these problems . 
  the rest were produced with the better suited mixture . 
  not entirely certain that you have a proper understanding of the english language , but stating `` we send the eu 350 million pound every week ( which is a lie in and of itself ) , let 's spend it on x '' means that the campaign is saying that said money * should * be spent on said x. 
  not y , not c or anything else , but x. 
  you got some kind of obsession about your ass and salt ? 
  this was a leaver-campaign bus which advertised exactly that . 
  get a grip on reality, 
  yup , right down retarded tory-logic street, 
  which regimes did they seek to replace ? 
  last time i checked it started in tunisia and then spread , because people had access to social networks and the means to spread these information . 
  syria started in a center of education and technology , so i 'm not sure what you mean by that statement . 
  and yes , radicalist benefitted largely from the events post-iraq since they could run it up and down the propaganda train . 
  the arab spring started in tunesia , which is probably as far away from iraq as it gets and was n't at all involved . 
  mass destabilization came when massive amounts of religious and political movements decided to jump on the revolution band-wagon and then have a say in the future of the country , more often than not going from `` we would like a democratic country like the west ! '', 
  to `` sharia for everyone ! '', 
  ah , `` my argument is not accepted as the truth by everyone , thus they must be idiots . '', 
  truly an intelligent individual . 
  yeah i 'm gon na trust the advice , regarding the middle east ; who describes religion as the `` axis of evil '' . 
  no thanks . 
  never said anything about it being easy . 
  also , the conflict went big very , very quickly with military aid send to rebels almost from the very start . 
   either the saa is a shitty army like the iraqi , or far too many defected why not both ? 
  they are a shitty army - except with the aid of russia and iran they were n't ` as ' shitty . 
  ( yes , i am aware the russian military did n't directly intervene until recently , they still send lots of material ) the defections did n't start until later in the war , especially when the war turned into this crazy , multi-facetted clusterfuck . 
  saa soldiers joined in the organisations their brothers or fathers now fought in or who offered the most money at the time and so on . 
  again , that was n't until quite a bit later . 
  yet you have fsa soldiers with us-made guided missle launchers . 
  or a dozen other groups and those do n't come from the syrian army , they are using the russian made ones . 
   for some time now like nearly all western support goes to the kurds and sdf that matters little - the point is that the war might 've been over rather quickly without the massive amount of material send over , even before the rise of da'esh . 
  the failure of the iraqi military did n't help it much , but still . 
  the point is not in syria , which is a convoluted shitshow , but in the middle east in general . 
  basically do n't do it like iraq or libya and things might look better . 
  want to build a new state ? 
  do it ` with ' the existing military instead of trying to shuve some unknown incompetent sod in there . 
  want to bomb a dictator into oblivion ? 
  fine , but do n't forget to rebuild the country after that . 
  those are just tiny points and ideas but my believe is that , if the saudi-iran conflict would finally settle down , the me will be much more stable and ready for rebuilding . 
  ( except afghanistan , screw that country , they 've been fighting since alexander the great and nothing will fix that ), 
   i find it funny how in islam you can not be ruled by a king or any leader that 's not the caliph ah c'mon , no one cares about that in the middle east and why would they . 
  half the people can barely read and the other half is smart enough to know that that 's a ridiculous idea . 
  me is similiar to europe in that fashion , only 200-300 years back and without the reform movement . 
   what do you think would happen when these so called leaders fell ? 
  the same thing that happens everywhere where political , religious and economical influences are strong - chaos , if left uncontrolled . 
  that 's why assad has to go in syria , but not in the same way the us would like it to happen but in a steady and controlled manner which gives time to adapt . 
   take some basic classes on geography . 
  you 're the british isles , not the european continent . 
  just like new zealand is n't fuckin ' australia . 
   says the guy with the `` remove homogays '' flair . 
  yeah says the guy with the left-over flair from the we-are-r/russia day and i ca n't be bothered to change it since i consider it rather funny , when there is no such thing as `` homogays '' . 
  some people ... 
  your first sentence mentions 2 points which are both adressed in the article . 
  that being that the modern conflict are much , much more complex than ` religion and politics of me ' but are both rooted in western interventions from so far as 100 years ago , all the way to everyday events . 
  the point the article tries to make , and rightly so , is that the constant conflict and flux in the me is not something you can blame on 1 thing . 
  hope you 're joking . 
  yeah probably . 
  but the arab-spring a result of iraq ? 
  please ... 
  quite a bit changed , the war was extremely prolonged . 
  what would the rebels do against russian tanks without guided-missile launchers , ammunition and weapons supplied by the us and allies ? 
  the war ** might 've ** been over by now, 
  ah i see you have n't even read the article . 
  top kek, 
  that 'd be handled on a state level , similiar to the us . 
  then again , you 're not part of europe . 
  also , the last paragraph shows that you have no fucking clue . 
   for example austrian chancellor compares hungary 's treatment of migrants to the jews under the nazis what does that have to do with anything ? 
  there is no statement in there but rather proof for the massive amount of people moving towards western europe . 
  ( not even mentioning the reason why austrias chancellor said that , left vs right and all that )  turkey is already holding eu by the balls and that 's all because of german reaction to this crisis , they get lots of concessions and at the end erdogan even force you to react on some clown , which is just humilating for germany you sound ** really ** upset , so you might wan na step back and take a deep breath , because so far , i actually quite enjoyed this debate . 
  aside from that , the plan with erdogan was stupid , but made little difference . 
  the refugees were in turkey one way or another , with turkey-eu deal or not . 
  also , germany did n't make that deal , but the european parlament . 
  ( yes , poland voted on it as well ) the comedian you speak of broke an ancient law , that no one even remembered existed . 
  however , the law is the law and erdogan has , sadly , the right to act on these laws . 
  in case you have not noticed , it will be abolished next year ideally . 
   but you 're giving them houses , accomodation and money here is hoping you are not serious . 
  otherwise you must be grossly misinformed . 
  jesus ...  they could be all armed terrorists right , they smuggled all those guns stuffed up their asses in front of over 15.000 german federal police officers , who are guarding the border ...  you ca n't and do n't want to deport anything germany can and does deport those , who are found inelligible for asylum . 
  there are deals with morocco , algeria and afghanistan . 
  with serbia , albania , kosovo etc. 
  declared as safe countries . 
  problem is , the deportation process takes a long time , especially with so many people . 
  it would be significantly faster , if we could get others to help us out ... but oh well . 
   when it overrun crimea in a day or two russia never overran crimea . 
  they incited violence via carefully inserting troops and then a coup with a faked referendum . 
  only then did any `` actual '' troops move in . 
  and that took about 2 weeks . 
   if russia would only want to annex donbass again , russia does not ** want ** to annex eastern ukraine . 
  they want a buffer country between them and their border . 
  just like belarus . 
   ecent actions of russia should be enough to consider reaction if the nuclear threats against finnland , sweden and poland are n't again , there is no point in having an active , large base for the us or any country . 
  poland , finland , sweden , estonia , latvia , whatever are all in direct proximity of allied countries . 
  you have yet to offer me a solution that makes actual sense for both nato , the us and the baltic countries . 
   we care so much about the russian opinions and interests except we do n't . 
  no one cares what they have to say , since russia talks mostly bullshit . 
  yet , if you take their voice away , the entire situation just got twice as volatile . 
  it worked in the cold war and it will work again - russia will collapse eventually and be unable to sustain their attempted military expansion ( which is a massive failure ) in the face of large nato military forces . 
  then they will ask for a diplomatic and political solution - it 's not an `` if '' , it 's `` when '' it will happen . 
   do i really have to find and link the exact quotes from german or austrian politicians ?
