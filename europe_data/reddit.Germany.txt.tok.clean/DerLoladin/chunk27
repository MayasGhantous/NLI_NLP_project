  yes , please do . 
  because that would be the exact opposite of what our foreign ministry reported . 
  ( even frontex stated so and they are very much so neutral in the matter )  refugees are fleeding war and there 's none in turkey the living conditions are horrendous though and do n't forget , this gives turkey ** massive ** political capital . 
  you really want erdogan with his hands on europe 's throat because he could just send millions of refugees across european borders ? 
  perhaps hand the extreme elements within some guns and grenades as well ? 
  i do n't care for the `` oh but we ** have ** to help them !! '', 
  aspect , while we do have obligations to uphold , it is the insanely powerful position of turkey i 'm worried about . 
  and if europe has to take in refugees to keep turkey out of europe , and with it grand-scale terrorism , then i 'm all for it . 
  'cause we can deport criminals . 
  we can do background checks - but we ca n't let a dictator control europe as a continent . 
   we do n't allow human trafficing , smuggling weapons or drugs you can only do so much on the large scale and to say `` we do n't allow that '' - please , get real man . 
  the exact same thing has happened since years . 
  the eastern bloc sees some of the most human trafficing and weapon smuggle in the entire world . 
  every country does their best to prevent this , so please do not be condescending . 
   if there would appear a mob of angry people trying to cross our border , too big for our border guards to control , then we 'd send army to make order pretty much what happened on the greek border to macedonia - is that bad ? 
  no , but the right thing to do . 
  same would happen in germany , except that the military can not operate ( with arms ) in germany . 
  ( it is under discussion if border controls would fall into that ) yet , there is no angry mob . 
   in these 1-2 days that germany reacts the baltic states would be over that is simply not possible . 
  look at eastern ukraine , russia can barely break the ukrainian army and they are , arguably , shit-level compared to latvia or poland . 
  even if coordinated , russia can not hold air superiority and the baltic sea would quite literally make it rain cruise missiles . 
  ever tried doing an offense against well coordinated , equipped and trained ground troops while also being pounded by air ? 
  yeah good luck with that . 
   there 's no rational reason to keep bases somewhere in western germany sice reunification and expansion of nato there are quite a few reasons actually . 
  first of all , they are established bases , some since over 60 years . 
  secondly , new bases are very expensive with a difficult political climate in the us in regards to european protection . 
  since you are so hard-bound in arguing as to `` why keep bases in west germany ? '', 
  - the us have actually closed , wait for it , over 215 ( ! ), 
  installations in western germany and only keep those , which are necessary . 
  now , why would the us invest heavily into a large base near russia ? 
  compare it to south korea for example - the situation is very volatile there with actual nuclear threats against the west and sk as well as military installations ** pointing ** at sk and seoul , ready for the first strike . 
  yet , those troops have around 140 abrams ( 50 more than in the baltics now ) , 170 bradleys ( again , 50 more than in the baltics ) etc. 
  you see where i 'm going with this . 
  the 30.000 active soldiers stationed there , are also only to delay until other allied forces ( such as japan ) arrive . 
  that is not needed in eastern europe , since help and many , ** many ** more troops are literally around the corner . 
   the same their military as economic demonstrations were ignored economic demonstrations ? 
  such as ? 
  the food embargo towards polish meat , dutch cheese and all that ? 
  come on , they just sell it somewhere else . 
  if russia wants to starve itself from those grocery products they can go ahead - food is allways needed somewhere . 
   but i can imagine its reaction to poland and which one would that be ? 
  because i ca n't imagine one . 
   now , i 'd like to ask , why germany is actually opposing that ? 
  because germany holds a status quo in europe , having the largest us military base on the continent . 
  aside from that , the country allways had more healthy relations to russia than the rest . 
  ( not entirely true , the netherlands and france also made plenty of deals , but you get my point ) a large military installation near russia could have a number of diffulties strung along with it . 
  germany loses some political capital 2 . 
  further escalation with russia ( no , the current tactic is not appeasement ) - a large military base might shut the door completely for further diplomatic solutions . 
  especially the second reason seems the most pressing . 
  while i can understand the difficult position that the baltics find themselves in , we need not forget that diplomacy should still be our number 1 goal . 
  a war with russia allways has to be the last resort , as it could be world war 3 , with the very real possibility for human life to cease existing . 
  thus , unless the absolute need arises , germany will most likely keep opposing such a base and point towards the guaranteed protection that nato grants . 
   they were allowed to come to germany which was their destination and the goverments which wanted to enforce law and control migration into the schengen zone were criticised for that . 
  no , they were not . 
  they were criticised because the arrival countries , like italy or greece , were about to burst and unable to handle the situation - so unless one wanted to have collapsing border countries , something had to be done . 
   these people to migrate from turkey which simply exploited this situation in its own favour the current wave of `` immigrants '' are not even immigrants - they are refugees . 
  and yes there will be economic migrants mixed in between but for now , they are refugees for all we now . 
  should the situation have been handled better ? 
  yes , of course , it was and still is a huge shitshow . 
  would the refugees have come one way or another ? 
  you bet !, 
  blaming germany or sweden for not sacrificing greece or italy or for the refugee crisis in general is not only short sighted but also blatantly stupid . 
  it 's not like they bombed syria and then thought to themselves `` oh goody , all those refugees that we can now dispense between all these european countries ! '', 
  being part of the eu should also count for something during hard times . 
  poland has benefitted immensly by eu membership , taking some refugees in will not change anything for the country , especially because they are still under polish law . 
   the party currently in charge was campaigning in favour of eu accesion referendum in 2004 in a coalition with po , yes . 
  this time around they are under massively different leadership with the ability to govern the country alone . 
  that makes a huge change . 
   practive poland would be the first country to react this is where i have to disagree . 
  let 's just run a scenario , russia attacks estonia in a move that aims to overtake the country . 
  the second this happens , us bombers and aircraft all over europe will be in the air , the baltic sea will be sealed shut for russia , kalinigrad either blocked or bombarded . 
  the qrf will immediately deploy to estonia , most likely with a huge contingent of polish and other baltic and western european soldiers . 
  i can only speak from a german perspective , but within 1-2 days , german tanks will be loaded up and every infantry men briefed on the new situation with reservists called in for re-training . 
   actions directed clearly against us sure they were trying to be very scary . 
  only works if you are actually intimidated by that . 
  russia can not take action except of flying some planes overhead and show how they can totally shoot da'esh nutjobs in syria . 
   he real partner to talk with in europe is germany actually not , the real partner is the uk . 
  the us is actually mighty pissed at germany for not fulfilling the 2 % nato quota ( which is still a huge disgrace imo ) and while still conducting a lot of exercises with the german military , it is in the hands of the us and their foreign policy where to establish bases . 
  i 'd like to ask you , what do you think would happen if the us would establish a large-scale base in poland , in terms of a reaction from germany ? 
   it can be propped up indeed it can , yet it wo n't be without the eu . 
  there is no other source of money , unless the ukraine decides to turn towards china , which in return would shut the door to any involvement with the eu . 
   ukraine has farmland and food never goes out of style true and there are possibilities for the breadbasket of europe - yet , a country of the 21st century can not survive on agriculture alone without massive subsidies . 
   maybe when you invite millions of immigrants stop . 
  you asked me not to repeat kremlin propaganda and rhetoric , then do n't do it yourself . 
  no one `` invited '' them , i have a dislike for merkel myself , but that statement is simply false . 
  or do you think they all just manifested out of thin air ? 
   the goals of german politics as of right now , a unified europe that distributes the refugees to every country . 
  poland does not want that and currently has a government that is not at all pro-eu . 
  they are also one of the strongest anti-refugee supporters , which puts them in direct conflict with the german proposition . 
  ( again , not taking sides , but stating a position )  baltics are totally defenceless and if something happends that would be responsibility of poland to aid them . 
  most baltic countries are nato , should anything happen to them it 's the responsibility of nato as a whole to aid them . 
  not poland , not germany , not the uk , but the entirety of nato . 
   you do n't think that nato should respond at least in sibolic what symbolic way ? 
  we have drills and exercised in the baltic sea and north sea all the time . 
  we have parades and land drills in lithuania , estonia , finland , norway and all the time in germany . 
  not sure what you are looking for ? 
  a pompous massive exercise with all nato nations ? 
  there is no point in that since , unlike russia , nato does not require these shows for power bolstering and chest puffing . 
  how about this , we buy 2-3 more ships for the same amount of money that russia spent on such a pointless exercise . 
   without german aprooval you have a massive misconception of nato .
