  the power lies with the us and with the us alone . 
  all of the highest nato commanders are americans , it is their decision and their decision alone . 
  the german government may object and voice concerns , but they do n't have to give approval or anything similiar . 
   on a failed belief that not `` provoking '' moscow here is my take on it , we can do both . 
  nato can keep the baltic countries safe via military expansion in some countries ( germany will spend more money on the military and get more troops , wish they would go over the 2 % requirement finally ... ) , drills with more nato participants who 'd have to fast responders and general closer interaction . 
  just like ... most other countries ? 
  yeah pretty bad that the entire world ( most countries have such laws ) is so ignorant and in such a da - ... oooooh , wait . . 
   our internal affairs , not about relations with germany one directly impacts another , i 'm afraid . 
   but we 'll need to pay for upgrade as anyone who wants to upgrade their leo 2 's , really . 
  while i would n't call it ` distrust and distance ' it 's more about being weary . 
  considering poland is ratteling the sabers quite a bit and being very uncooperative towards the goals of a german government , it makes sense . 
  ( not saying whether this is right or wrong , good or bad , merely offering a different point of view . ), 
   no , the us or any military presence in baltics is little not really , pretty large contingent is moving around the baltics . 
  ( 90 m1a2 's , 120 bradleys and some other stuff ) with continous exercises and military presence ( cold response 2016 ) . 
   `` zapad '' maneouvres with belarus [ ... ] but germany and nato ignore it first of all , germany ! = nato . 
  aside from that , just like nato has every right to hold all the exercises and drills that we want , so does russia . 
  unless there is serious agression , most countries do n't want to ` waste ' money , so to say , on drills . 
   what for germany needs american base if the cold wat is ended and nato moved eastwards ? 
  those bases are not for massive combat troop deployments . 
  the largest ones are ramstein airbase and some others , which is mostly administration . 
  ramstein however , is the heart of the us air froce in europe , wounded troops in combat are flown here , satellites directed and drones controlled . 
  that 's not something you can just pack up and move . 
  ( and yes , polish soldiers serve on ramstein as well . ), 
   i 'd say that our air forces are n't worse than yours that is not what i was saying . 
  what i was saying is that there is continued air coverage from german and dutch eurofighters in addition to the air forces of the baltic countries . 
  edit : also do n't understand why people keep downvoting my comments as if i were the incarnation of putin himself on this forum . 
  how ** dare ** one bring intelligent discussion here !, 
   nato doctrine in the cold war , and most likely now , is to ensure that russia is unable to leave the barents sea except that every military commander was well aware that you 'd never take murmansk and never reach sewerodwinsk in the time it would take russia to launch their submarines . 
  there would n't even really be a point since they were allways at sea . 
   under-budget , under-funded and ill-maintained oh good , so just like russia who ca n't even project power properly in ukraine . 
  there are plenty of countries able to mount a serious defense against russia , even without the us . 
  uk , france and germany have experienced troops and some of the best equipment in the world , with germany having the ability to rapidly just throw a crap-ton of money at the military and a huge amount of soldiers in the reserve . 
  poland is also a huge factor just like the scandinavian countries . 
  if you truly believe that the european nato countries would be unable to halt russian agression , then you are so very wrong . 
  the us might be the cornerstone to achieve true victory , but russias military is in shambles . 
   why most of eastern europe quickly joined nato as soon as they were free from the ussr 's grip quit your whattaboutery . 
  the ` why ' does not matter in this context . 
  nato wanted to get close to russia , ideally encircle it . 
  which they achieved and are working on even right now . 
  ( georgia ) hell , nato even signed a contract to ** not ** expand beyond eastern germany - swiftly ignored that though . 
  please , look up expansionism , some military context and actual numbers and then even ** you ** could offer some valid arguments . 
   did russia allow the iron curtain to fall or the ussr to dissolve or the warsaw pact to break up ? 
  huge , huge difference here . 
  you 're trying to compare the entirety of eastern europe in rebellion and an economy beyond fucked , to a small scale conflict at their border . 
   meanwhile the west can easily afford to prop up ukraine except that they wo n't . 
  multiple european countries said they wo n't finance a war , this will get worse if the right-wing movements gain power in europe - they are all pro-putin and ukraine wo n't see a penny . 
  pretty much . 
   what developements ? 
  big move to the right . 
  abolishment of certain government institutions and so on . 
  poles might see it differently , the western part of europe does n't though . 
   not sure what ties you have with netherlands and france lots of cooperation , sharing bases and even sharing an entire amphibious assault ship with the dutch . 
   but germany is clearly oppsing establishment of nato bases in poland there is a pretty big debate about the need for such . 
  the us presence is already very large in germany and the baltics . 
  thus some people argue that poland wants bases for prestige and diplomatic weight , rather than any actual need for protection . 
  ( poland is surrounded by bases , there is a dutch - german qrf in place and your skies are covered . ), 
   the money that we 're all giving them that is 50/50 with russia . 
  while they sell a huge amount of wood , gas and oil , they also sell some bits of software and export arms and weapon systems . 
   it 's quite warm eh , i dunno about that . 
  especially with the recent developments in the polish government . 
  also would really prefer closer military ties , like we have them with the netherlands or france , for example . 
   if i want to sponsor saudi terrorists rather than the russian separatists how do you mean ? 
  yes due to a reformist taking power and initiating a large-scale power struggle inside the country . 
  such a thing wo n't happen in russia since they will allways be backed by china and the russians simply not ** wanting ** reforms . 
  not quite sure whether to laugh or to cry a little when i 'm reading ignorant stuff like this . 
  please , either inform yourself at least a little bit or try and stay away from politics . 
   but they would be the right outcome for the whole situation indeed they would be and it is a nice idea but it wo n't happen until russia is on its knees . 
  and at that point , a long-term solution will be needed , not short term revenge . 
  reparations can be paid off via other sources but fixing the western-russian relations and moving the country closer to the eu , that might be a 1-time chance only . 
  it is my hope anyways , that the rivalry between russia and the west will eventually stop and that we may find a solution as to how to prevent future conflict - and even though it is a ridiculous notion , perhaps even a spot for russia in the eu . 
  yeah weapon embargos will ** really ** put the hurt on russia . 
  just like blocking their oil expo - ... oh no wait , china will just buy it and thank the western world . 
  a tiny border point in the north with norway and via alaska . 
  nothing that would bother any military minded person - the eastern european corridor is the worrying part . 
  if you truly believe that a country should not feel threatened by continous expansionism of their international rivals , both in an economical , military and local influence sense , then you truly have no idea what you are talking about . 
   it took us many years of hard work and shocking reforms to fulfill the accession criteria indeed and i am very glad that our neighbours are part of nato just like i am sadened that the political climate between our countries is n't warmer . 
   nato and then eu when it was in expansion mode nato still is in expansion mode , look at georgia . 
   i wish that ukraine would join perhaps , but it would also be a risk . 
  first the economy would have to stabilise and the corruption factor be reduced . 
  ( aside from that , the eu would have to unfuck itself internally first ) russia also needs to be brought to its knees , without the ability to lash out at their neighbours due to the extreme constraints while accepting closer relations to the eu . 
  those are already in place , at least as far as it is possible without cutting all political ties . 
  there would be quite literally , zero reason for that . 
  russia wants a buffer zone from nato and western influence , it tries to create that via war in ukraine . 
  you seriously believe russia has it out for some ukrainian soldiers ? 
  please ... 
   is the favourite catchline of kremlin propagandistic media matters very little . 
  moscow sympathizers will call it a struggle for independence , the other side a russian invasion . 
  one mans terrorist is another ones freedom fighter and all that . 
   it is a superpower and scare the whole civilised world with a big war and it is . 
  russia might be wrecked economically but if i have learned one thing through studying russian history , russian friends and visiting there once , is that the people there will believe almost anything and endure hardship to whatever degree . 
  russia can not stand against nato , nor can any other country on earth - that does not mean that they would n't be able to inflict terrible , terrible losses . 
  china could n't stand against nato , yet they are a superpower as well . 
   your country was the most powerful in the world at one point uhm , no . 
   but in a couple of years you were paying the reparations to israel after 6 years of the bloodiest conflict in human history , multiple european countries reduced to ash and craters , a war on 3 fronts at a time and the active participation of the two largest and most powerful nations on earth . 
  that is not a price i would be willing to pay , especially now that a desperate country has the option to nuke their opponents . 
   moscow has committed a series of international crimes perhaps they did , perhaps they did n't - all comes down to perspective , right ? 
  you ca n't prosecute russia , that will never happen and you are delusional if you think otherwise . 
  they are still a superpower after all , and short of inciting world war 3 , you will never get putin on trial . 
  just like the us will never pay for their warcrimes or their international crimes . 
   proposing to recognise to the occupied territories as sovereign states is laughable .
