  you have a better idea that does not entail the ridiculous notion of putting russia on trial ? 
  keep on fighting a war that will just keep on stalling ? 
   how many of those failed unrecognized states are we going to allow russia to create ? 
  hopefully not any others since most members are nato . 
  i 'm merely afraid that ukraine will face a decision at some point soon , continue the war or finally improve the country and stabilise and the economy . 
  that matters little , the eu puts a large incentive on joining nato as well . 
  and they would 've had a field day with a large country like ukraine eventually joining , encircling russia completely . 
  the issue i 'm seeing is , why keep fighting a lost conflict . 
  ( suppose it fucks over russia pretty badly ) ukraine will not be re-united , the ukrainian military will ** never ** be able to retake all of eastern ukraine , russia just wo n't let that happen . 
  keep the sanctions , make donbas `` independent '' and end that drain on the economy , refocus on anti-corruption to get into the eu . 
  relatively simple , the issue for russia was that eventually ukraine would try and become a nato member and part of the european union . 
  that is completely unacceptable for russia , just like it would be unacceptable for the usa to have mexico or canada in the warsaw pact . 
  the plan was to create a new buffer country - split ukraine in 2 so you still can keep nato away from that border at least . 
  in the end it did n't work out since russia has massive issues actually projecting power . 
  well , no . 
  germany for example does simply not have a right-wing party any longer . 
  so who should the people from the right political spectrum vote for ? 
  my honest believe is that , were the eu more open to the public and actually try and fix the image of being a corrupt cesspool , the public opinion would vastly increase . 
  then again , does n't have to be huge referendums . 
  ( no such things like `` would you like refugees ? 
  yes/no '' ) but , i dunno , `` would you like to preserve this important forest ? 
  yes/no '' and there we go . 
  it 's nothing huge but helps to build an image . 
   increasing the power of the european parliament ? 
  quite the contrary . 
  more referendums , finally pushing for a law on lobbyism , which is so desperately needed . 
  putting barriers in place so eu officials ca n't just jump ship to a large corporation who just so happened to really want them . 
  there is so many great things that the uk could push for , which many german politicians support btw . 
  ( especially greens ), 
  uk could also stay in the eu and revamp it , not in their favor , but in the favor of the people . 
  more referendums and such - yet , that is not what london wants . 
  leaving the eu has become a way to fish for votes across the entirety of europe , not because it makes sense or because it would bring long-term benefits , but because it makes it easy for people with little insight , to just blame all their issues on the eu . 
  not getting the salary that i want ? 
  must be because eastern european x is stealing all the jobs !, 
  politician y is lamenting some stupid issue that he/she is too lazy to fix ? 
  well , he/she is saying its the eu 's fault , must be true !, 
  there is a huge amount of whining going on and plenty of people saying `` oh let 's just leave ! '', 
  but when asked after that `` and what then ? '', 
  there are no answers , only blank stares . 
  ah right , i forgot that germany is running the eu . 
  weird that all of the things and ideas that are brought up are not instantly approved . 
  how dare they to tell us how much sugar we can put in our jam/marmelade !, 
  we are already paying less while being part of the power triangle , but that 's just not good enough . 
  ( you could also try and help fix whats wrong but the easy way out certainly the better option . ), 
  you could also try and get your shit together and help fix whats wrong . 
  but then again , that would require work and effort ... 
  takes one to know one - but hey , at least we managed to drop the racial superiority and fascism part . 
  allways late to the party poland, 
  `` obviously you did it like 150 years back - it 's time we give it a shot as well !, 
  stupid or not , we wo n't be lacking behind you ! '', 
  you heard it here first folks . 
  burn ** all ** the trees !, 
  do i really have to mention that this is sarcasm ... jesus, 
  we need ** more !!, 
  poland , the last ** true to god ** country on god 's earth !, 
  defending the true and proper christian values - trees are obviously heresy , god wants lung cancer and coal plants !, 
  no , it does not . 
  but most likely makes some people quite a bit of money . 
  this forest is unique and a huge tourist attraction in the area . 
  then again , trees go against christian values and have to be cut down !, 
  first of all , most here will find poland on a map . 
  stop acting like an idiot . 
  secondly , the forest is the last remaining primeval forest in all of europe . 
  it is ** unique ** , in case you do n't know that . 
  well ... kinda . 
  but generalisation is never the right way . 
  poles are pretty insane when it comes to religion though . 
  trees confirmed as heresy . 
  how dare those filthy europeans ** like ** our forests ? 
  burn it, 
  the cross in my living room , kitchen , bedroom , bathroom , workplace ordered me to destroy this forest !, 
  do n't you know that the previous government put the forest there in the first place ?!, 
  ** obviously ** this fasci - ... i mean just slightly right wing government is just saving us . 
  totally justified . 
  who knows , those occupied germans might come back to save the ... well , i do n't actually know why . 
  but yes , perfectly understandable - they deserved it after all , the forced marches with the women and children . 
  ** especially ** the children . 
  by your logic , poland deserved the brutal german occupation every day . 
  oh poor , poor poland . 
  grabbing a large portion of the bully 's country is of course forgotten in that story . 
  not to mention all that sweet revenge when pushing all the ethnic germans out . 
  problem with that argument is - that collapse would 've happened one way or another . 
  no matter how you look at it , german corporations would 've done the same thing and greece would have crashed and burned just as quickly . 
  the eu might 've not done the whole issue any favors , but pinning it on germany or the eu for that matter , is ridiculous and short-sighted . 
  uhm , no . 
  france , britain and germany are the power triangle . 
  only france is too incompetent for it , britain wants to leave ( for bs reasons ) and now there is only germany left . 
  well someone is salty that they only got communism instead of sweet us dollars . 
  except that they are n't prosecuting anyone yet , this ruling only states that they poem is fine , only the sexual references are not . 
  what the article does not mention is that karneval der kulturen is a huge mess . 
  as a women you are very lucky indeed if you are there and not be harassed . 
  people are either drunk of high as a kite and fucked out of their mind . 
  this is nothing new or worthy of report - but hey , `` it reminds of the new years events '' no it fucking does n't . 
  no mention they were immigrants , just young men - please share the information that you have . 
  plenty do identify with germany , aside from that , the guest workers were needed . 
  even turkish ultra-nationalists are german citizens . 
  old findings , this was already reported last year . 
  while certainly something to condemn and which should be a call to action , these people have the opportunity to report abuse , threats or any other offenses to the police and request another residence . 
  if they do n't do that , how is anyone supposed to know they are effected ? 
  oh i 'm sorry :( math was allways my worst grade,
