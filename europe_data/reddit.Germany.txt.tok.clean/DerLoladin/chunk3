  right ... the whole infrastructure thing that europe paid for and all that , completely worthless, 
  `` not perfect , wests fault . 
  russia would have been better '' right ... because russia is all about helping other countries prosper economically, 
  would ` ya look at those daesh-wannabees . 
  well , here is hoping for a quick military trial with execution ... who am i kidding . 
   `` we watched planes that cost nothing wipe out targets america had missed or overlooked or that , according to american pilots , they were n't allowed to hit , '' well , he 's not wrong . 
  if i were to nuke the entire middle east i could also claim that i wiped out targets that neither russia nor the us were able to hit . 
  surprisingly accurate , especially if you take a look at celebrities and such . 
  they are all `` pro refugee '' for example , because they are not the ones who even live anywhere near the problematic areas . 
  russia has had plenty of troops at their western front for a while now and so did the us and other nato members . 
  hell , they are having parades at each others border . 
  yeh , i 'm sure they are just ** outraged !, 
  ** just like last time when un peacekeepers were having sex with children for food and when someone exposed it , it was hushed over until he went to the news . 
  ** good job un - as allways **, 
  agreed , just a small correction though . 
  they were hung rather than shot . 
  no matter what one thinks of her , some of the events surrounding her are just as sad as they are hilarious . 
  ( to me anyways ) - she is a wanted criminal in ukraine , because she criticised the opposition protests and called it a `` coup '' . 
  - survived 3 assassination , 2 of them car bombs - sanctioned by japan but also head of the russian-japanese friendship delagation what a shit-show surrounding that women, 
  first of all , she is not ugly , no matter what you think of her . 
  if you suggest otherwise i recommend a reality check and/or a pair of glasses . 
  second of all , i do n't speak fucking russian so do n't link some video that is only in russian !, 
  so you still are proud to be german . 
  no matter whether you believe nationality matters or not , if someone looks you up , anywhere in the world , they will find `` born in germany '' which makes you , factually , german . 
  thus being proud of your country conveys a sort of pride to the fact that you are a citizen of the country you are part of . 
  ( since a great many of those advances are still part of us and live with us to this day . 
  meaning that you 'd have to be proud of being german to be proud of all the accomplishments ), 
  you 're not proud of the accomplishments ? 
  if you look at the cultural and scientific advances that germans have brought along ? 
  when 2 seperate countries tore down their wall to become one germany again ? 
  not feeling an ounce of pride there is some sociopathic bs, 
  most people who oppose the refugee policy have a lot of solid facts backing their opinion . 
  however , whenever they present them they get shut down via ` oh you racist !, 
  ' / nazi insults . 
  works really well for both sides ( to which mister b\u00f6hmermann also belongs ), 
  he is alright at times and really , really stupid at other times . 
  kind of hit and miss with him, 
  it is a huge mix , the largest issues stemming from a culture and religious background that is , hands down , really backwater and long overdue for reform . 
  put social issues into that and you suddenly have a ` great ' bed for terrorist activities . 
  worst of all though , and arguably much worse than any of the recent european involvments ( us is excludes , those guys messed up big time in the me ) is the position that saudi-arabia holds . 
  actively destabilising the entire region as well as funding terrorism throughout the world . 
  ( do n't tell me `` but the state does n't do it ! '', 
  of course they do n't do it all openly and with a ceremony ... ), 
  right , 'cause the root cause is the intervention in the middle east !, 
  wait , did n't the article say something about people like you as well ... 
  hahahahaha - sorry that made me laugh . 
  why is it that munich or stuttgart are so well off in terms of immigration ? 
  well , probably because there are hardly any immigrants living there !, 
  most germans ca n't even afford to live in those cities . 
  oh i 'm sure there parts of spain who care . 
  i was more referring to the rest of europe who sadly do n't seem to give a collective fuck about it . 
  spain has passed one , but they are kinda luny right now and no one gives a shit . 
  france is a concern , but the french have never let themselves get fucked over by the government for too long . 
  so i 'm sure there will be protests and riots eventually . 
  and germany has not passed a single surveillance law ( recently ) that would justify something like the title of a ` police state ' . 
  you bet they get plenty of help from the surrounding countries . 
  france most definitly assists and so do the dutch and germans most likely . 
  oh just wait until the csu splits with cdu , they will be branded populists very quickly alright . 
  populistic is accurate in some cases . 
  such as , if a party is using a current crisis to grab voters with their `` anti-thingx '' policy that fits the kneejerk reaction that many have . 
  however , they do this to draw attention * away * from their other policies . 
  the death toll is not the big issue but the effect it has on the environment is substantial and long lasting . 
  but the energiewende !, 
  amazing feat of the cdu and see how well it worked !, 
  we went from nuclear energy to ... coal plants ... wuuu !, 
  the minister of defense ` is ' the government . 
  thus his comments and opinions represent poland on an international level . 
  oh , but it would be so amazing if it would be enforced ... 
  the afd itself would not be blocked , but their proposals , such as restricting the the abortion right would be dragged into court . 
  germanys constitutional court throws out laws on a regular basis . 
  abstaining is very controversial and may or may not actually work in the favor of the afd . 
  voting for the fdp is also not really an option , since they are a barely existing party that disbanded only 2 years ago because no one voted for their crap ideas . 
  on the last paragraph i have to strongly disagree !, 
  these voters not lost , by no means . 
  people also do not allways wanted to vote far-right . 
  if you look at the [ result ] ( http://www.mdr.de/sachsen-anhalt/politik/landespolitik/wahldaten-100.html ) in sachsen-anhalt , `` die linke '' ( a far-left party ) as well as spd ( center left ) lost a massive amount of votes , which went straight to the afd . 
  it makes no sense to suggest that the people voting left would now suddenly vote far-right because they allways intended to do so . 
  die linke , in this case , has allways been the go-to protest party . 
  that 's quite literally the only reason they get votes at all . 
  now that the voter have different issues , such as the uncontrolled and unlimited immigration , they vote for a different protest party . 
  ( btw , die linke is just as extreme and retarded in some of their ideas as the afd ) it 's a similiar story with the spd since they turned out to be huge hypocrites in this entire ordeal . 
  first they say they are pro-immigration yada yada , only 1 month later they say the opposite and how crap merkel is . 
  this is exactly what i mean with the outcome that was ** bound ** to happen . 
  the two largest political parties completely ignoring the people and voter base for years on end are now facing the consequences across germany . 
  agreed and i do not share the views of the hardcore afd voters , however , i can understand ( not sympathise ) with the decision to vote for them by some people . 
  you mention they should vote for a party that is not full of right winged extremists and nut jobs , well , there is n't one left . 
  cdu was exactly that and has `` betrayed '' its voter base with their current actions . 
  besides , a lot of those changes in terms of rights and abortion and all that would be blocked by the constitutional court . 
  so while this result might be radical for some , it 's mostly reactionary from my perspective and just might bring some interesting changes with it . 
  ( from the cdu and spd ), 
  have to disagree there . 
  vote changes are allways reactionary . 
  most people will not read the party program and be caught with whatever a party is currently vote fishing with , thus you can hardly blame cdu voters for the mess with merkel since they could n't anticipate such behavior . 
  it might not seem like it , but there is no party in germany that is ` conservative ' or right winged anymore . 
  who are those with that political view going to vote for ? 
  certainly not cdu , they have made the jump across the left-right fence . 
  this outcome and protest vote is imo a good thing for 2 reasons . 
  first of all , while it is dangerous , it messes with the cdu 's and spd 's power . 
  second of all , finally something has changed in politics in germany . 
  for years now it was allways cdu or spd , they could say whatever they wanted , do whatever they wanted , the votes would come in either way .
