  oh yeah you have me convinced that jordan , egypt , pakistan , indonesia , azerbaijan and so on are massive fans of him . 
  i 'm sure ... 
  okay ? 
  cool story bruh . 
  yet it has nothing to do with the comment or the article . 
  yes i am sure that all the muslim nations would feel very inclined to assist the ridiculous dictator in a holy war because he wants to win a referendum ... / s, 
  that does not discredit the entire comment though , merely part of it . 
  oh certainly . 
  but how does that stand in relation to poland or hungary ? 
  it 's not like the comment was specifically aimed only at austria . 
  how he discredited himself . 
  elaborate, 
   the most vile world war in human history haha god damn , what 's that even supposed to mean ? 
  that is highly questionable . 
  not a huge deal as eu-uk and uk-eu flights should be unaffected - there is also relatively little to gain from uk national flights . 
   why germany wants to move jordan because the conditions in incirlik are very questionable , the political atmosphere is unstable and the turkish governments refuses mp visits to incirlik , which is outragous . 
   why they couldnt ? 
  as i said , too much of a bother to pack everything up and leave now . 
  we 'd also have to do a lot of upgrading the airfields in jordan , which would cost money and time . 
  not a huge problem , but tedious . 
   why they are not coming back ? 
  i assume this is supposed to mean why german troops are not moving out of incirlik and back to germany ? 
  well , first of all turkey requested the help and secondly , this is an international nato mission against isis that is based partly on incirlik , since turkey is also a nato member . 
   same reason why countries want foreign military bases . 
  allows them project power and makes their words bolder.this is why you want it incirlik is a turkish military base with a wide foreign presence on it , including italian , german , us , canadian and other nations forces . 
  let me say it again , it 's a * turkish * military base . 
   ar in syria will end one day , and germany will want herself in table no thanks , germany has no interest in expanding our borders into syria ... unlike another nation . 
  germans do n't want it , politicians do n't want it , soldiers do n't want it . 
  however , we have to fulfill a nato obligation and if we would be bothered , we 'd preferrably move our stuff to jordan . 
  considerably better nation nowadays anyways . 
   violation of the sovereignty of my land wat ... 
  i can live with that . 
  yes ... and now read what op summarized at the top of this post and realise your own stupidity . 
  ah , historical revisionism and bias , the plague of un-academic debates . 
  `` alternative history '' . 
  quit trying to be edgy and retarded . 
  you 're trying to push an agenda and excuse terror attacks as `` fair '' or that germany , sweden or any other nation `` deserve '' them for taking in refugees , merely because two individuals were born on german soil in the year ** 1990 ** and ** 1995 ** . 
  strongly disagree . 
  if they are not a german citizen then they have no reason to be in a german prison . 
  merely being raised and born on german soil does not constitute the `` benefit '' of german prison . 
   accept everybody . 
  yet the suspects are born and raised in germany . 
  but sure , totally `` fair '' , you nob . 
   wont that cause a bit of a tension between natives and them ? 
  probably but that 's the responsibility of the state in that case to educate both parties and ease tensions . 
  ( as well as take care of physical alterations )  it is harder to integrate people that do not wish to be where they are . 
  `` integration '' should not be the final goal with the refugees , afterall , they are supposed to stay here temporarily and then go back/be deported . 
  so integration measures to a degree that they can work and speak the language somewhat - yes , beyond that there is no necessity in most states . 
  germany , sweden and others with a demographic problem might go further then that to encourage more to stay , however , this is unlikely to happen in countries who do not experience such a demographic crisis . 
   invite everyone in that 's cute . 
   make everyone else to pay for the `` drags '' . 
  no actually , it 's called a refugee convention that these countries have signed and have to oblige . 
  but you do n't seem to be too overly keen on the law so you probably do n't care . 
  why yes , you can . 
  unless they wish to forfeit their refugee status they must live in the place they are told to stay at , as long as it complies with the law . 
   politicians spending time reading up on philippine politics , duterte , meeting with opposition groups , communicating with philippine officials , debating in the eu parliament , issue a statement and publicity . 
  there are people that do that for them . 
   this takes time from other more important topics . 
  hardly any . 
   in general i would argue the political discourse is generally rather one-sided and many groups are fighting for advancing their agenda . 
  oh you are definitly right there is a crazed drug-addicted dictator throwing people out of helicopters and having others murdered in cold-blood and then there is * that * not happening . 
  the choice is of course totally one-sided . 
  the eu is a massive entity with global influence , by speaking out against it we * are * having an effect . 
  drug lords are not getting shot though , nor is their influence any less . 
  please , i urge you to read up on what is actually happening in the phillipines ... 
  why yes , which is why the redistribution effort is so important unless one wishes to let some of the most struggling countries in europe struggle even more . 
   keyboard warrior ... my goodness you poor thing . 
  now hush-hush and back into your self-space bubble with all the other degenerates . 
  and this was me telling you politely that you are a god damn nutjob who has zero clue what he is talking about . 
   opinion `` you know , killing people is totally okay and all that . 
  it 's cool bruh really . '', 
  that 's you right now , but good job . 
  might wan na have yourself checked though , 
  that 's not what moral is or how it works . 
  it 's ingrained in human behavior that killing is wrong . 
  doing so anyways , without reason , is a strong indicator for questionable mental health and has , again , little to do with ideology . 
   there is nothing wrong with me , i am being objective in the matter . 
  no , you 're being a ridiculous arsehole that does not manage to grasp the difference between ideology and basic human rights and morals . 
  it 's not about policy or about theory . 
  it 's about people being murdered for no real reason and * that * has little to do with ideology , as it 's considered wrong in pretty much every culture and every moment in history . 
  it 's * in-humane * . 
   it 's sad that drug users are getting shot first and questions latter . 
  regular people but ok .  our ideology killing innocent people without trial and for mere `` dislike '' or political disagreements is not `` our ideology '' ... 
  most governments can focus on more than one thing . 
  unless they are right/left-wing populists and know they only get elected on that one thing . 
  even if you are an arsehole who does n't care about random people being killed on the street by a dictator , the power-shift towards china in the area is very much so our business . 
  that secondary one is nationalism though . 
  that 's not necessarily patriotism though , just a `` form '' of patriotism . 
  in general that sentiment still very much exists , people just do n't go around like 4th of july in the us and jerk each other off about it . 
   the migrants did n't stop to ask if they are willing to honor that obligation . 
  well , news spread fast . 
   any countries on the road not honoring a legal obligation does not put a obligation on germany . 
  it sorta does because they have nowhere to go otherwise . 
  ca n't really dump them into the baltic sea , can you now . 
   pushes the problem into the face of richer countries that should be at least paying for the un refugee camps . 
  if you mean european nations by that , they are . 
  countries like germany , sweden , france pay a lot for those camps and support jordan directly with monetary packages . 
   they also only done the bare minimum in regards to living conditions , but the refugee convention does not protect from shitty lives in shitty camps , it protects from people trying to kill you . 
  well , in theory it 's also supposed to secure your human rights which include proper living conditions . 
  however , most nations just ignore that part 'cause otherwise you run into so many more issues .
