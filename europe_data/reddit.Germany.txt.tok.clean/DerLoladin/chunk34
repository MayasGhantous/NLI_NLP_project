  false . 
  stgb \u00a7 130 specifically cites `` incitement '' of hatred or violence . 
  meaning that you can walk up to your neighbour and insult him as much as you want based on whatever you like , including those three things . 
  ( probably will get you for harassment in that case though or just insultment ) \u00a7 130 specifically targets speech in the sense of calling upon others or speaking to others . 
  for example , to a crowd and , as in this case , via facebook by making a comment . 
  ( since you are actively trying to reach others ) furthermore , the first part about `` spreading hatred '' is very vague and not necessarily applied . 
  however , saying `` we should gas them all '' will get you in front of a court for violation of \u00a7 130 . 
  please , explain to me the german hate speech laws then . 
  will be interesting to see what pops out . 
  then that 's not exactly normal , is it now ? 
   that 's just a sign of unsupervised boys . 
  just ... no . 
  i want you to show me a bunch of regular , normal boys in that age group running around stoning and kicking animals for fun . 
  that 's not `` normal '' and has nothing to do with lack of supervision . 
   insane because calling incursions on fundamental rights goes against your totalitarian agenda ? 
  no but you might wan na read again . 
   those are at best cosmetic measures if chilling effects are large tfw the verfassungsgericht is `` cosmetic '' . 
  jesus ...  freedom of speech is the most powerful protective guard and is a right in itself . 
  your freedom ends where the rights of others are infringed upon . 
   once you lose that right all others are goners as well funny , considering , again , since a solid 70 years we have been perfectly fine . 
  even ** with ** these `` massive '' infringments . 
   once korea is unified and the government intends to impose laws with a large chilling effect on free speech , then allussion to the kim regime is very justified . 
  so should they reunite you will draw comparisons between the two koreas for laws that south korea has right now ? 
  that is interesting ... and also insane . 
   the idea is to a , be robust if things are not as peaceful , by having a strong democracy where essential rights are protected and b , not introducing laws that could in fact undermine democracy in itself . 
  good that germany has the bundesverfassungsgericht to take care of that . 
  you know , division of power and all that . 
  considering that the gg is considered to be one of the , if not the single strongest constitution in the world , no need to worry . 
   is having an opinion also having an agenda ? 
  an opinion ought to be at least somewhat informed . 
   informing on what ? 
  german hate speech laws for example . 
   that this law is too vague ? 
  the first part of it is a little vague but has found a solid definition through previous german legal cases . 
  you got ta say some pretty abhorrent stuff ( openly mind you , with a megaphone to a crowd for example ) for that to kick in . 
   they still had agency , individually and collectively . 
  aight , next time someone talks about south korea i 'm gon na bring up north korea and tell them how absoloutly awful south korea is , because ya know , north korea exists and does awful shit so it must be their fault !, 
  / s  but that does not mean that you do not incur risks if you mess with their most important method of knowledge allocation . 
  weird , has n't hurt us the last ... 70 years . 
  i 'll take my chances , thanks for being concerned . 
   i think you are too full of yourself . 
  and i think you have an agenda without informing yourself of ... anything . 
  but it 's not something new . 
   so still not neutral . 
  do n't apply romanian government standarts to germany . 
  thank you very much . 
   but how is this unrepresentative of modern german mistakes ? 
  if you knew anything of eastern germany then you 'd also be well aware of the communist puppet government . 
   mentioning this is very appropriate when they again undertake a massive incursion into this most vital freedom of a democracy . 
  yes !, 
  oh my , how much german democracy has suffered since the 50 's in western germany and ** again ** after 1989 !, 
  the horror !, 
   twitter employees can not be sure if a text ( specially if it 's written in german ! ), 
  seriously ? 
  you know , companies such as these do also have german speaking employees ... 
   but if i say i hate all turks is not ok ? 
  perfectly fine to say that . 
  the end . 
   where hate speech is defined by vague definitions and enforced selectively except it is n't . 
   fuck if that was me i 'd just delete everything reported just to be safe from utter financial ruin . 
  cool , have fun with the report from the ministry . 
  nah , people who do n't understand what is hate speech in germany are pretty stupid and dangerous , because they spread bullshit around that other people pick up on so very easily . 
  considering that the ministry of justice reviews all of it ... very close to it . 
  `` they will '' , `` they likely will do x '' , `` now these companies are going to ... '' do you have a crystal ball around with which you can see the future ? 
  'cause , if the ministry of justice reviews it , that means they 'll have to publish a report on how many were `` rightfully deleted '' and how many were n't . 
  which , in turn , means the companies will either have to do it properly or germany might take further steps to ensure that they do . 
  unlikely but possible , depends on how hardcore someone is to try and make a complaint about it . 
   did you fucking forget the stasi ? 
  good way of picking the one from the two examples that is not only unrepresentative of germany as a whole ( less states , less population , less economy ) but also the one that furthers your agenda . 
  great job , you get 5/7 troll points . 
  not really . 
  plenty of cities in europe where you can live perfectly fine if you only make the countries average salary . 
  but munich for example ? 
  on roughly 2000 $ brutto per month ? 
  good . 
  luck . 
  just ... wat . 
  i do n't even . 
  what has may to do with the referendum all of a sudden ?!, 
  is it `` alternative history '' month or was there an interdimensional timeshift ? 
  'cause last time i checked the referendum happened under cameron as premier . 
  facts are `` my narrative '' oke then mr `` alternative facts '' , thats cool . 
  but ... the referendum happened under the same government . 
  i have to ask , does it actively hurt ? 
  `` when we said , `` the uk wo n't leave the eu . '', 
  we did n't actually mean that . 
  you know , we learned a lot from our friends over the atlantic as to how to do politics . '', 
  - tories spokesman, 
   citation needed common sense as well as making comparisons himself : lacking  has very little ( if not nothing ) to do with what has been happening in turkey . 
  oh god it hurts , it hurts so much . 
  just ... stop . 
  please . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleichschaltung ) is what you are reading . 
  a similiar system was applied in the soviet union and gdr . 
  however , it goes further than that . 
  erdogan has had 20 years of time and very , * very * slowly changed the rhetoric from `` yay democracy ! '', 
  to his current stance . 
  this process of inching tiny steps while making sure that the economy `` appears '' to be healthy has made his followers , even the secular and moderate ones , follow him along likely without noticing too much of a shift themselves . 
  that is what you are reading . 
  apparently not with great success .
