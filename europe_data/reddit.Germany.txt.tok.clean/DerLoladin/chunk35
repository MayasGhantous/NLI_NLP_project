   here 's a little bit of context on what people generally think of when they see the word `` flair '' . 
  yet we are on reddit where `` flair '' has a very specific meaning . 
  no one gives a shit what the original application for it is . 
   p.s. 
  i 've visited one of the concentration camps in bavaria , i know germany still has the equipment needed to re-enact their anti-semitism . 
  please keep your gas chambers turned off . 
  ps : shame they let someone like you even see one of these places . 
  but alas the us still has crosses and guns , so i 'm sure you can re-enact your white supremacy streak ... oh no wait , you already do . 
  nevermind  and now fuck off . 
  uhm , right so in many of these cases like munich or zurich , you better make a pretty penny in your job or you 'll not live all that happy of a life there !, 
  god give me strength , for fucks sake . 
  do you ** see ** the little ** line to type in ** down there ? 
  ** that ** is your ** flair ** !, 
  the flag is seperate . 
   plus , israel is 75 % jewish . 
  sooo , pretty big minorities who are n't jewish . 
  congrats , you discovered exactly what i just said . 
  oh i ca n't point fingers at someone who has '' < 3 netanyahu < 3 '' as his flair ? 
  please , elaborate . 
  because '' < 3 netanyahu < 3 '' you moron . 
  that 's what a flair is , not the flag . 
  aside from that , how the hell would i even know that he or she might be jewish ? 
  you do realise that plenty of muslims and christians live in israel as well , right ? 
   implying al jazeera is a propaganda machine yeah right . . 
  biased on topics , probably , but that 's far from propaganda . 
   no democratic or freedom loving institution can survive a culture opposed to liberal ideals . 
  that is quite simply false and a bullshit statement . 
  a culture that is over the course of two decades slowly turned around , with outside enemies , populism and an extremely vocal supporter base has fallen victim to a political assimilation process that is deeply rooted in fascism and communism rhetoric . 
   instead , the culture and values espoused by the electorate enabled erdogan not really ... at all . 
  this is some `` gim me upvotes '' populism crap . 
  the political divide in turkey is rather extreme , not even to mention my previous point . 
   rdogan is an aberration we must tolerate for strategic reasons , but the very notion of someone similar being propped up by our own citizens is frightening . 
  indeed . 
  huh , i can think of a few others as well ... 
   blatant propaganda machines like al jazeera and here is where you loose all credibility . 
  but looking at your flair you never had any in the first place . 
  the vietnamese in the gdr are not an applicable comparison . 
  not in number , not in cultural background , not in circumstances of living , not in immigration policy . 
   my position is that she did a lot to invite them in and to try and make other countries accept them after the fact , without any prior consultation . 
  that 's why it 's called a `` crisis '' . 
  germany is allways supposed to `` lead europe '' but please only if it 's convenient so the other nations do n't have to step up . 
  and no , your position is simply false as i outlined in my previous reply . 
   your references to eu values , etc is what i am calling `` moral grandstanding '' . 
  and i am calling it massive hypocrisy by hungary especially . 
   do you think she should have handled the situation differently hindsight is 20/20 but considering that it is not called a `` crisis '' for nothing and that no one that i know of has a magical crystal orb ( aside from the afd , ukip , fn etc. 
  of course ) it all went over pretty well . 
   about the potential 7 million who maycall germany their home now ? 
  oh even more funny numbers . 
  source please . 
   are you suggesting that merkel means what she says when she denounces multiculturalism ? 
  she has declared multiculturalism a failed idea in the way it was used in germany so far , which i agree with . 
  and unlike other politicians she at least had the spine to admit that this stance was a mistake . 
  ( which news outlets and alt-right retards abroad turn into a much bigger policy thing then it is ... ), 
   it was a significant component , but there were other routes the route over italy , yes . 
  but that 's about it and that route is still open since it stems from north africa . 
   and would n't it make sense to take a multi-pronged approach instead of leaving all our eggs in turkey 's basket ? 
  sure , yet kneejerk reactions are no solution or approach , yet it is all we got and are still getting because , who woulda guessed , strong-man politics and kneejerk reactions apparently get you elected . 
   elaborate . 
  she cites eu laws , values and other stuff in the article , in all of which she would technically be correct . 
  perhaps misguided , but still puts a nice spin on pis 's and orb\u00e1ns `` muh values '' movement . 
   merkel 's lack of intervention speaks volumes . 
  the cdu is not a fascist party where only one person may make a statement or a party where everyone has to carry the party line or immediately be denounced . 
  it 's a political party afterall with many views and individuals . 
   is n't it ingrained in germany 's psyche by now that `` silence equals consent '' ? 
  really ? 
  a holocaust reference ? 
  talk about stooping low and making ridiculous comparisons . 
  kinda sad , really . 
   yeah , funny that we 're about to activate article 50 !, 
  ... what ? 
  dafuq has article 50 to do with that article or german internal politics ? 
  jesus ...  i 'm seeing an increase from 8 % to 11 % no , you 're seeing different polling websites representing their different political leanings . 
  generally the afd polls at 8 % however , both infratest and insa have connections to the party and poll the afd often more favourably . 
  in case you had not noticed , these are all the current political polls from march . 
   are you just deliberately ignoring merkel/germany 's rather large role in the immigrant crisis ? 
  are you just deliberately ignoring the situation that greece and italy were in ? 
  sweden might 've been pushing for the humanitarian aspect but until greece was about to implode there was relatively little except internal bickering about the borders . 
  were german politicians happy with border fences and razor-wire patrolled by armed vehicles and personnel ? 
  but neither should you if you value the progress of the last 70 years at all . 
  thus the ( fake - ) exasperation of certain politicians should not come as a surprise . 
   here is merkel actively denouncing the construction of borders , which would have alleviated the situation in some way . 
  ah yes , the borders that helped so much because it was totally not the eu-turkey deal that sealed it shut . 
  / s  here is meps from her party threatening to cut eu funding from poland and hungary for not being so happy to accept the migrants . 
  and technically she would be correct . 
  here i was thinking it 's all about `` law and order '' for pis and orb\u00e1n ? 
   i doubt the wave of non-syrian opportunists would have been so large had she not made the foolish statement in the first place . 
  who ? 
  highly doubt that anyone cares about her opinion . 
   source . 
  funny article from the telegraph , yet it shows a severe lack of understanding of the situation . 
   her invitation to refugees and immigrants to come to germany last summer how to de-value your opinion and article 101 . 
   but the success of the anti-immigrant alternative for germany ( afd ) party , once a centre-right movement now infiltrated by more unsavoury elements , suggests that a growing number of voters no longer trust her handling of the refugee crisis . 
  do they mean [ this afd ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/ ) ? 
  yes , truly crazy numbers . 
  it 's a romanticised image that many immigrants hold . 
  it 's the same for russians , for example . 
  politicians like erdogan are experts in manipulating the opinion of people , especially those already favorable to your cause . 
  an entire generation grew up under erdogan and has partly bought into the whole personality cult , while not having to suffer any of the consequences . 
  i 'm sure most people can comprehend what that means , a community of people that say `` oh we 're so turkish and connected and turkey stronk ! '', 
  while no one wants them in turkey or sees them as `` turkish '' , yet they have such a romanticised image of a country they know virtually nothing about .
