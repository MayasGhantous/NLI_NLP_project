   you 're right , but she could have done some things to alleviate the crisis . 
  such as ? 
   she was complicit in her moral grandstanding and in declaring that europe was open to all on behalf of her 27 co-members source ? 
   you are absolutely right but i would add that immigrants who are better educated usually assimilate easier . 
  not necessarily , it comes down to assistance from the government , job prospects and ease of assimilation . 
  many in europe like to parade the fact around of the `` us having no culture and history '' and while that is not strictly false , it also makes it a lot easier to assimilate into a nation and culture that is easy-access to anyone . 
  furthermore , job prospects are a big thing . 
  you 'll have a hard time finding any low-education job without having a solid grasp of the language , which is funny considering that the higher and top level education jobs are moving more and more towards english as a universal language . 
  this mixture makes it very difficult to assimilate into a european nation and is simply circumvented by higher-education immigrants who have had the education and resources to go straight to the job market . 
  it 's not about being on the same level as germany , that 's like saying `` it will take decades until we are on the same level as china '' . 
  poland is a natural hub for economy and thus is doing pretty damn well , considering the past . 
  it 's not a conspiracy though , it 's an article * about * conspiracy popping up . 
  `` our country is being robbed '' `` but our economy is one of the strongest ones development wise in europe ! '', 
  `` robbed i say !, 
  by germany !!! '', 
  what attacks ? 
  please , enlighten me about those attacks in germany today . 
  we were talking about the threats , not the action of closing the shoping mall which is quite a rare occurrence in germany as well . 
  usually only done when ww2 bombs are found or such . 
  any country , really . 
  israel as well , but most threats are not communicated because why would you do that and cause people to worry . 
  eh , it 's not massive news really . 
  there are terrorist threats all the time for shopping malls and pretty much one for every single football game ever . 
  and on which grounds and for what reason ? 
  or are you another one of those people with a spare crystal ball lying around ? 
  since 2009 , sure . 
  not a refugee though . 
  allegedly , yes . 
  never debated that either did i now ? 
   maybe because he started attacking random germans with an axe i dunno ? 
  what exactly does that have to do with him having been granted asylum ? 
  can you provide a source that proves a corrolation between asylum seekers being more likely to commit crimes with axes ? 
   you do n't actually take yourself serious , right ? 
  my mistake , i was thinking neither were you so i wanted to match that . 
   ah because he 's already here since 2009 he 's not an asylum seeker ? 
  what 's so bad about him seeking asylum in germany ? 
  please , elaborate . 
   also , 95.6 % of the population in kosovo is muslim ... makes it all the more likely that he might be from a religious minority , considering he was granted asylum . 
  not nearly as much as you with that kinda comment probably , considering that he is here since 2009 , without a previous criminal record and that the police have not released his religion . 
   pluralism is a failure . 
  [ mfw ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/robert_a._dahl_in_the_classroom.jpg ) certain people do n't even grasp what pluralism is , but read it in their alt-right facebook feed . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wesa9m_y3u ) , that i stole shamelessly from u/wykopowy _ on , describes you quite nicely i 'd say . 
  have you counted the logic hoops you had to jump through for that conclusion and if yes , have you reached triple-digits yet ? 
  while i am aware that little information reaches the little island nation of yours , yugoslavia does not exist any longer . 
  no , you are of course quite right . 
  all these immigrants trying to be people in other countries and then becoming the victims of crime . 
  if a swiss person hits someone with his/her car and that person is an immigrant , of course the immigrant is at fault for being there in the first place !, 
  switzerland only for ** true ** swiss people !, 
  you better provide a family tree or you 'll get deported again !, 
  wait , what do you mean switzerland would be rather empty then ?! ... 
  ** heavy / s **, 
  weird , considering i was using a multitude of weapons quite happily for 2 years and was considering getting a waffenschein . 
  but hey , must be me being afraid of guns , 
  yes , truly the victims must be at fault . 
  how dare they come to switzerland and be a person !, 
   this entire shit ~ ~ article ~ ~ can be summed up with : ** muh gunz !, 
  muh evul media !!, 
  muh second amendment ... oh wait **, 
   you know that many people from jugoslavia came as refugees to germany ? 
  and around about 90 % went back . 
   many of the problems we have with current refugees still apply to those from 20 years ago . 
  source or bullshit . 
   or to all immigrants for that matter . 
  oh no another one ... 
  but yes , i agree . 
  austrians are among the worst bunch of immigrants to be honest . 
  ugh , like , you are so right . 
  and can you imagine ? 
  we have a ** border ** with them !, 
  now i understand the pain of turkey , considering that place is pretty much like syria . 
   many are not able to be integrated into society , do not learn the language , have different values and cultures source for that applying to ex-yugoslavians , otherwise bullshit . 
   they have a hard time to find jobs uhm , no . 
  ex-yugos are among the most hard working people you will find in germany . 
  they might not all be doctors , but they sure as shit carry their weight . 
  well , those who stayed anyways . 
  oh and , since i 'm asking you for sources i am more than happy to provide one . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article149064620/die-meisten-fluechtlinge-bleiben-jahrelang-arbeitslos.html )  we would all be better off if that individual would have not been allowed to stay in germany ah right , lem me just look in my crystal ball and see the future !, 
  ooooh ... yes , yes , hmm . 
  might also be the aneurism that your comment is giving me , putting pressure on certain areas of my brain , but who knows , perhaps i am the only human being that can actually see into the future !, 
   they 're just going for the best bet tbh . 
  `` the best bet '' - ahuh , sure . 
  you know , the big story in germany this week is a 17 year old who tortured , recorded and then brutally murderer a 9-year old boy then fled and is suspected to have killed two more people . 
  wan na take a guess as to what his ethnicity is or will you suddenly change the `` best bet '' scenario ? 
  i 'm curious . 
   try doing a search on interpol 's website for european countries done that and could dig up very little , but go ahead i 'm curious what interpol has on their website that the average ~ ~ alt-righter ~ ~ i mean , concerned citizen , could find . 
   unfortunately it usually is . 
  `` usually '' ? 
  like the driver in heidelberg a few days ago who plowed into civilians and then bailed ? 
  oh yeah , afd and all the other usual suspects were immediately on that `` good job germany letting them all in . '', 
  must 've been really rough when it turns out that he was a 35 year old german . 
  ah man , dropped it like a hot potato and did n't even make the news because if he ai n't brown , people do n't give a single fuck about it . 
   yugoslavia had the highest percentage muslim population in europe and ? 
  balkan muslims have very little to do with the middle east or would you like to dispute that ? 
  please outline that with a source on radical islam in the balkans , thanks . 
   this man probably entered germany as a refugee ? 
  okay ? 
  well , my ancestors did as well - now what ? 
   you realise bosnia is a muslim majority country ? 
  omg a muslim majority country !, 
  oh noes , the horror !,
