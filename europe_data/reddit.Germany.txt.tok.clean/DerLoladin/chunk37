  a majority by 51 % with 46 % being christians , living together ... in one country !, 
  can you imagine ? 
  oh gosh , i dunno how you 'd be able to defend the `` good christian values '' in such a circumstance . 
   it is n't , no . 
  yet it is though . 
   that you made yourself look stupid nah you beat me to it , unfortunately . 
  : /  compare something like the kkk to fucking al-qaeda . 
  apologies , how could i dare to compare such defenders of good-ol christian values and the defenders against the white genocide to evul muzlimz ... / s, 
   al-qaeda is an umbrella organization ah right and the kkk is n't . 
  got it . 
  damn you got it pretty bad son , might wan na get that checked out . 
  but beware of any potential evil commies and `` muzlimz ! '', 
  so from former yugoslavia - funny how all the comments screaming `` muh rapefugees !, 
  you deserve this germoney ! '', 
  are instantly deleted . 
  because why wait for facts when you can confirm your own bias before anything is established . 
  notice a trend ? 
  they are all wealthy because of one reason or another - plenty other countries do not have that pleasure of being relatively small-ish and with a special status . 
  aside from that , australia and singapore have plenty of power ambitions in their zone of influence . 
   we do this because of a lust of international power no , your country does that because politicians are retarded . 
  the money is there to solve it , it 's not a `` pick one '' issue . 
   fact is that countries that do n't lust for power really ? 
  switzerland , quater , monaco and so on are pretty garbage places to live in if you are n't rich as fuck . 
  funny enough , especially qatar still has ** literal ** slavery - but hey , must be a great place because no power ambitions and such . 
   i do n't want my country or europe to be obsessed with power and influence over the world . 
  recognising the role + place in the world as well as ones own potential is quite a ways away from `` obessing over '' something . 
  al-quaeda is effectively dead so i guess they do n't count anymore . 
  wtf is this apologetic comment ... ** that ** is some bottom scraping . 
  well , it is either the side of being short-sighted or progressive in the sense of looking at the bigger picture . 
  i mean , they are not wrong in their asessment , the arab revolutions were indeed a chance that europe let slip by . 
   there 's no correlation between international power and those things what an incredibly short-sighted and disconnected view . 
  or democratic rights , poland is certainly right on the chinese heels with that !, 
   in germany , it includes : ** hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ** not npd - must be modern progressives, 
  do n't think anyone ` hates ' poland . 
  like , not at all . 
  the pis government though ... well , that is another story . 
  how did you jump from a rhino being killed in a zoo to terrorism ? 
  wut , gun laws are already crazy strict like ffs . 
   europe has to get the borders under control . 
  and how would we do that ? 
  noticed as of lately that there is such a thing like the mediterranean sea ? 
  not even to mention all the nations who are unwilling to cooperate and get their shit together . 
  do n't forget about the pieds-noirs especially in the southern areas . 
  what ? 
  of course it can . 
  like keeping puppet dictators in south america and southeast asia is not part of the us foreign policy anymore . 
  in germany it is a mix of muslims and right-wingers . 
  so yes , it is white western and eastern people being xenophobic and ridiculous since being `` alt right '' has somehow become completely fine in the face of the public again . 
  what 's even more disgraceful about it , is the fact that these parties are the ones using the `` oh the poor jews ! '', 
  rhetoric for their campaigns . 
  fn is the perfect example of this , led by one of the most anti-jewish political dynasties still remaining in europe , yet they use that for their agenda . 
  muslim communities are no better while luckily turks are * mostly * excluded from that sorta bullshit-rhetoric a lot of others will find a whole lot of echochambers in both their own communities as well as with the right-wing online . 
  generally similiar all around . 
  the upper class and oligarchs began wearing them as a status symbol since they were either illegal or ridiculously expensive . 
  thus they found their way into society , being highly sought after as a representation of status and style . 
  eastern europe and the balkans are weird . 
  oh yeah i am well aware . 
  especially ridiculing t_d posters gets you instantanous downvotes , guess why ... 
  doing this mostly to amuse myself and to inform some people who might come into these threads with an open mind . 
  what ? 
  i 'd be flattered if someone would cite me on wikipedia but alas i 'm not an expert on uk acid attacks and crimes . 
  well , if you do not wish to provide some trust for authors and experts on the topic then i guess very little is actually proven . 
  good luck with that btw . 
  in case you did not know , muslims even live in poland of all countries !, 
  yes , i know , crazy right ? 
   the number of assaults involving acid throwing and other corrosive substances has tripled in six years in england , official records show . 
  nhs hospital figures record 144 assaults in 2011/12 involving corrosive substances , which can include petrol , bleach and kerosene . 
  aside from that , common might be the wrong word . 
  rather `` occuring '' might be a better one ( and yes , pre 2015 such cases were reported in germany as well . ), 
   that 's not what your link says , either . 
  actually it does . 
   the study reported a male : female victim ratio of 1:30 for acid assault in bogota , colombia , although recent reports show the ratio is closer to 1:1 . 
  [ 72 ] reasons behind these attacks usually stemmed from poor interpersonal relationships and domestic intolerance toward women . 
  moreover , female victims usually came from low socioeconomic classes and had low education . 
  the authors state that the prevalence of acid attacks in other areas of south america remains unknown due to significant underreporting . 
  [ 71 ] especially the latter part is significant . 
   such naive reasoning . 
  such little knowledge on how recruits travel to the middle east to join such organisations . 
  ( small hint : they do n't pay for it )  how did this different situation come about ? 
  an influx of muslims * . 
  rather the larger presence of terrorist attacks , plots as well as the organizations on the internet itself , where a lot of younger people radicalise themselves . 
   maybe you 'll argue that these extremists were already here before 2015 . 
  no need to argue that , because it 's largely the truth . 
   well now an extra million people with similar profiles have just arrived in your country . 
  yes , we just `` imported '' a million rapefugees and terrorists - plis daddy trump save yurope from da evil muzlimz !, 
  / s and now hush hush , back with you to t_d . 
  just fyi , `` this attack is of the profile of muslims '' is disproven by that link . 
  considering that it is common in europe , british-asia ( you know , hindu and sikh territory ) as well as south american . 
  yeah i know , all those damn muslims in south america ... / s, 
   per my reading the article specifically mentioned those as a `` part of the uptick '' . 
  which is one tick in the box more than statement . 
   funny how you can try and read an article `` alternatively '' just so you can fool yourself into thinking the refugee influx was n't a mistake . 
  funny how one can read any article remotely related to the agenda one is trying to push and spin it in a way , that makes it an `` alternative fact '' . 
  in another universe that might be the case , but , as i quoted from the article , there is no such link in reality . 
  except that is [ not true ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acid_throwing#epidemiology ), 
  because how else would you push your agenda ? 
   so many could actually be immigrants or failed asylum seekers who are going there . 
  more likely to be students from abroad or europeans living in germany , as asylum seekers lack the money to finance such a trip . 
   maybe it 's because you imported a million people from an area of the world where islamic extremism is rife ? 
  or it could be the reason mentioned in the article .
