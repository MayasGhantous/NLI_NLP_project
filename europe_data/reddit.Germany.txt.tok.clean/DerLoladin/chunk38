  but why read when you can make assumptions , right ? 
   the bfv explained that part of the reason for the uptick was the heavy press coverage of terror plots , as well as the increased ease in connecting with extremists online . 
  it also cited an increased danger in young people being radicalized online , saying that then their friends and relatives might not be able to see what is happening . 
  ah nice , i see none of the people here have read the article . 
  but hey , must be muslims amiright ?!, 
  alternative reality team , assemble !, 
  well , keep in mind the state that russia was in at that point in time . 
  defensist or internationalist ? 
  defensists assemble !, 
  it 's those immigrants , king jesus help us !, 
  what ? 
  this has nothing to do with security . 
  because he is only covered under eu health insurance and the rules are the same for everyone , no matter what their occupation is . 
  he could have gotten health insurance from the state , just more expensive . 
  and ? 
  which is something often propagated around and not at all rooted in reality . 
  well , it 's not free , just general and public . 
  but as an eu citizen you have to pay the bill first and * then * request the refund . 
  where did i insult you ? 
  or is the fact that somehow that joke , which is harmless banter same as ` time to retake poland ' , is triggering you an insult ? 
  so calm your tits brudi . 
  aside from that i did n't even down vote you . 
  oh , and still ... no . 
  simple , if you have no other choice ( like in the election system in france ) at least i 'd go for the `` honest '' politician rather than the one who has the same goals but would rather lie about them to scam my trust as a voter . 
  and i think it 's funny . 
  that was n't the question . 
  what you are implying is that you prefer that politicians lie to you so that it makes you feel better . 
  lol at least make an effort to read the stuff you 're talking about , jesus, 
   then why they had to shoot him ? 
  because he ran , was caught and did not surrender ? 
  you know , police things . 
   in the end it all depends how you define `` terrorist '' . 
  for me , it is a person which wants create terror . 
  if it has a political aim and is planned . 
  thus far there is no confirmation of any political goals . 
  so you can define things all you want , hell , you call a goat a duck instead because you `` define '' it that way , does n't make it any more true though . 
  ah yes , so many similarities . 
  especially when people post actual facts in r/europe while t_d circlejerks about him being a muslim . 
  alternative facts and all that . 
  also , solid alternative comparison right there . 
   this is what happens when the media completely discredits itself . 
  no , there is plenty of media to access that is perfectly reliable . 
  you see what you * want * to see . 
  t_d and other far-right nutjob forums have an extreme need for self-confirmation , they constantly have their world view reiterated and echo 'd back to them as to feel they are in the right , ` misunderstood ' and thus also feeding their victim complex . 
   however , one should keep in mind that singapore is a nation with incredibly tough laws . 
  the death penalty still exists and caning is also still practiced . 
  at least make an effort to read my previous replies , please . 
  you said `` free money '' which those 100 $ 's are . 
  everything else is not free money ... 
  ah yes , all that sweet , sweet free money . 
  a whole 100 $ per month in germany with which they have to buy their clothing , food or any other `` luxus '' articles like hygiene articles or free time activities . 
  my god the travesty . 
  ah so you want to reintroduce the death penalty and shape a nation after japan , because that 's just working great for them with all the suicides and such . 
  but hey , you 're tagged as a far-right agenda pusher anyways . 
  so i guess that goes to explain that . 
   it has nothing to do with the free money and tons of their countrymen being there already . 
  `` tons of their countrymen '' - yes , the middle east and north africa are actually all just one entity and amoeba , really . 
  jesus christ some people ... 
  sure , instead they receive uneducated balkan and asian immigrants . 
   when they are put in eastern europe by refugee management agencies , they leave for sweden . 
  yeah no , because the ee governments refuse to take them in the first place and why would you stay in a country that barely provides you with all the necessities while holding one speech after another about how awful you are and how much you hurt this country . 
   but ultimately which culture is the issue here . 
  yeah western european , eastern european , north american , south american , african and middle eastern cultures are really the issue here . 
  / s  you can go to the poorest areas of singapore or japan and they 'll still have lower crime rates than any multicultural european city . 
  jesus christ those examples ... 
  so first of all , japan is not comparable to the rest of the world . 
  never was , never will be . 
  why ? 
  because of a multitude of reasons that i wo n't get into , however you can do some reading [ here ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/blog/?p=74 ) singapore is not comparable either as foreigners and immigrants are very quick to find work and can get by with their wages as well as being easily absorbed into society . 
  ** however ** , one should keep in mind that singapore is a nation with incredibly tough laws . 
  the death penalty still exists and caning is also still practiced . 
  so yeah , might wan na reconsider those countries as comparisons for europe ... 
  newsflash : the uk was an eu member in 2014 when they signed it and still is !, 
  i know , crazy right ? 
  as i have said before , the eu merely * provides * the funds for such projects in the member nations . 
  however , the governments themselves are responsible for handing these funds out . 
  meaning that any corruption and sketchy deals going on in hungary are due to the national government being corrupt as fuck , that 's not something the eu can change or is at fault for . 
  quite the contrary , the eu has done a great deal to assist in fighting corruption in romania for example . 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  when comparing it with the numbers from czechia it suggests a rather difficult situation in which the swedish system for integration and assimilation does not seem to work all that well . 
  increased poverty always results in increased crime . 
  meaning that looking for the reasons of migrant-poverty and tackling those will likely provide efficient long-term effects in addition to new measures taken for law enforcement . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/480b4ae0-aa9e-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122 ) the important bit :  his team is looking at a gross upper estimate that includes unpaid budget commitments , pension liabilities , loan guarantees and spending on uk-based projects . 
  this would significantly exceed the ft 's estimates of a net bill of $ 20bn , which strips out uk-bound spending and contingent liabilities . 
  what you 're saying does n't even make any sense . 
  why am i not surprised . 
  people living in poverty , no matter the culture , ethnicity or religion , have always been linked to a higher crime-rate . 
  but yes , it is all a ** massive ** conspiracy ... 
  the eu-member commitment for funding the eu till 2022 , a commitment that the uk signed and which is the reason for the 60 billion claim . 
  you ... do realise that this is handled on a national level , right ? 
  the eu just provides the funds , the national government decides on the usage . 
  you signed a commitment to a market that you then decided you wanted to leave . 
  that 's not the fault of the eu but a decision made by the people of the uk . 
  you forgot you still had to honour the commitment you signed ? 
  well , tough shit . 
  first of all , teachers in most states only get tarifvertr\u00e4ge and no more beamtenstatus , unless we 're talking about bavaria . 
  so that list is already obsolete in the first place . 
  secondly , as is also outlined in your source , the after-tax outcome for employed teachers ( the majority ) is significantly lower . 
   gesamtnetto beamtin : 2820 euro ( bei 4030 euro brutto ) in comparison to  gesamtnetto angestellte : 2.430 euro ( bei 4.030 euro brutto ) now , furthermore , i have relatives who are teachers working in berlin , brandenburg and niedersachsen and no , they do n't get paid anywhere near what the list claims . 
  would be nice though .
