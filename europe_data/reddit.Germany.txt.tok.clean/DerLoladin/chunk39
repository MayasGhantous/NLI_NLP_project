   berlin 3.642 $ hahahahahahahahahahahahaha ... no . 
   most could make 2-3 times the money `` outside '' . 
  sure , ** after ** they finished studying . 
  where they wo n't earn nearly as much as the military pays during that time period , since you receive full sold . 
  edit : oh , also , i wan na see a political sciences or history student make 2-3 times their officers pay . 
  good luck . 
   saying equal pay for a primary school teacher and a company commander which primary school teachers have you been talking to ? 
  o.o unless we 're talking bavaria teachers get paid pennies in comparison to officers , why do you think we have so few teachers . 
   also why do you feel the need to come out as a condescending ass ? 
  because you 're making statements while talking out of your ass . 
  had you asked a question or said something along the lines `` my understanding of it is/was ... '' then i would have explained it to you in softer words . 
   on anything else that creates jobs it is quite literally creating jobs , just not the `` right jobs '' for ` certain people ' . 
   improves the average german living conditions or infraestructure which has always been and always will be a stupid argument . 
  you do n't improve `` muh average german living conditions !! 111 ! '', 
  by throwing some money at it , agenda 2010 took care of that . 
  infrastructure has ** nothing ** to do with the state but is taken care of on a federal level . 
   or just use the same amount of money to help like 10 times the number of refugees back in turkey , lebanon , etc with none of the potential downsides . 
  yes , hand erdogan even more money that he will certainly use for refugees or lebanon , a country so small it 's already bursting under the 3 million they took in . 
  none of them have any corruption either , so i bet it will work perfectly fine ... / s seriously ? 
  aside from that , the people are ** here ** and not in lebanon or turkey . 
  tough shit , got ta play with what you 're handed . 
  oh look , a `` concerned citizen '' . 
  no , that is not how economic activity even remotely works . 
  by funding certain companies you are investing into the most profitable sector for germany , since that stuff is coming straight back . 
  your examples are just kneejerk afd material that i wo n't even bother to go into greater detail , as to why that 's possible but simply not done . 
  oh and if you believe the csu/afd will change that , then you 're a moron . 
   all these things would also increase economic activity not really , especially hartz 4 is a massive money-sinkhole with plenty of people uninterested in jobs . 
  extremely unlikely . 
  considering how secular denmark is , i 'd bet money on the court just throwing it out while saying `` why the fuck does this still exist ?! '', 
  reading that sub i do n't see any relations whatsoever to me stating that flags , on r/europe do n't have to mean anything . 
  i could be russian or romanian for all you know . 
  flags do n't grant legitimacy . 
  naturally assume because he has a scottish flag , he must be scottish . 
  also why the shit are you linking a subreddit in that comment ? 
  110 % agree on the bundeswehr bullshit not being worth the money , for me anyways . 
  especially the absolute nightmare that it is to get any training materials like ammunition . 
  ( ** everyone ** gets to sign a trazillion documents , yaaaay what do we have nachschubler for !? ), 
  and no one wants to live in the middle of absoloutly nowhere , just because some people deem military bases too close to larger cities `` uncomfortable for the citizens '' . 
  but overall , it as more about the direct comparison of wages to sold , which is pretty good imo . 
  i would n't do it again though , unless the bundeswehr cleans itself up and * mistet ordentlich aus * . 
  perhaps not a huge boost , but it is not a massive loss as people claim it to be either . 
  every cent spend is reinjected into the economy , which in turn makes this whole endeavor like a big subsidary . 
  not great , but not terrible for the economy either . 
  if i have learned one thing from my time there , then that soldiers are some of the whiniest bitches on the planet . 
  now , that is very subjective of course but from my point of view , the amount being paid to low - to zero-qualification workers is quite handsome . 
  if we go up the ranks that disparity increases slightly , although i 'd still argue that your average ofw is compensated quite well for his time . 
  officers have the least to whine about , especially because they are getting paid wicked amounts for studying for 4 years before even `` working properly '' . 
  honestly , the only state in which the comparison of the civilian market paying better is valid , are bavaria and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  i ca n't imagine there being any other states where people are paid more or just as much with the same level of qualification . 
  yeah she finished her degree at the age of 4 in 1944 . 
   not to mention that the civilian economy pays better not really , to be honest . 
  you want to have a look inside your penalty code ? 
  i am sure you will discover plenty of things that say `` xy law in 2017 ?! '', 
  those laws exist everywhere , no one bothers to dig em up or scrap them since it 's just not worth the time to even bother . 
  so calm your tits will ya . 
  i 'm sure if one goes digging through all the ancient laws of the netherlands , people would come up with plenty of retarded bullshit to charge someone with . 
  so get off your high horse ffs . 
  no one has been prosecuted yet . 
  merely charged . 
  and i can give myself a scottish flag . 
  or a polish flag . 
  or an american flag . . flags do n't mean squat . 
   the biggest defenders of free speech today come from the right oh like the afd , ukip or fn or pvv who just ban reporters and `` unfavourable journalists '' from attending ? 
  spend a little less time in your t_d safespace and look at the real world . 
  it 's tremendous , yuge even . 
  we have the best free speechers , it 's true . 
  what a bunch of absolute horseshit . 
  for anyone that is n't u/el _ di4blo and actually wants to get some form of educated thought into his or her head , here is what happened . 
  post ww1 political violence erupted in germany , with two large movements taking the front of the action . 
  the first being the communist movement , invigorated by the `` success '' of the october revolution in the former russian empire and the second one being various right-wing and fascist movements , supported by germanys own version of italian fascism as well as extreme militarism . 
  while the communists had no direct support , the fascists had plenty of it from former soldiers with more or less private armies forming who travelled around to cull communist movements wherever they popped up . 
  however , thanks to the golden 20 's , the political violence died down as people just had better things to worry about in those days . 
  yet , when the golden 20 's ended the resurgence to political violence was all the more extreme . 
  the nazis and other right-wing partys all had their own `` streetfighters '' to attack the opposing groups rallies and marches , the communists took a bit longer but eventually also former such groups with the social democrats being the only ones who only resorted to violence in few cases , if at all . 
  shortly after , of course , the sa was turned into an `` auxilliary police force '' by hitler when he was appointed chancellor which basically meant that they could crack skulls on the pavement as much as they wanted . 
  suspected communists were n't just beaten anymore but detained and imprisoned without trial . 
  it is still a choice , does n't matter if anyone indoctrinates them or not . 
  just like attending church is a choice or living on a vegetarian diet . 
  only because your parents raised you from birth on a veggie-diet and told you `` it 's the best thing out there '' does n't mean you have to live as a vegetarian . 
  if it were only that then there would be no need to ban the face veil in schools , universities or while driving . 
  you can wear a helmet in those places as well , afterall . 
  that 's not the point , it is about religious symbolism not belonging into the public-sector . 
  whether that is expressed through a hijab , face veil , crucifex or buddha statues . 
  is a full-face veil ? 
  in some cases yes , in many more it is a choice . 
  next up ban the crucifex and ` jesus pics ' in classrooms and government please . 
  thanks . 
  gon na send this to a friend of mine in the fdp , he 's either gon na think it 's really god damn funny or he 'll get really upset . 
  bets are open . 
   far right conservatism in america is comparable to say , the fdp of germany . 
  i think i just threw up while also having an aneurism . 
  holy fucking shit , you have no clue whatsoever what you are talking about . 
  i wish i could link this entire conversation to r/shitamericanssay ... 
   this is why she gets so many parallels drawn between her and hillary . 
  only from the american side - as i have said now about 5 times , ** your ** definition of `` conservative '' is not applicable to europe . 
  again , it very nicely goes to show how very little you know about germany , the german government , politicians in germany or political history in germany . 
  and i wo n't waste my time detailing every tiny bit you 're wrong about . 
  like her general stance on immigration , foreign aid , government spending , her tax increases etc. 
  thankfully your standard of `` conservatism '' is not applicable to the rest of the world or who knows what the hell might happen . 
  and i 'm about done with this retarded conversation about how merkel is `` centre-left '' or liberal :'d jesus fucking christ , even writing that feels wrong .
