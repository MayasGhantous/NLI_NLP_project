   she falls under left wing authoritarianism hahaha , jesus fucking christ . 
  everything you say in this thread would almost be sad if it would n't be so funny . 
  god damn man ... 
  well , good thing american politics are far from being the benchmark for the rest of the world . 
  but yes , you seem to be quite an expert on german politics , especially the developments since 2000 or how certain spending relates to the constitution . 
  / s why is it always ham ` ericans on this sub ffs ... 
  ah , never change murica , never change . 
  nice meta account . 
   ` conservatism is the new counter-culture ' is a quite interesting point in countries where the so called liberal values are the mainstream . 
  oh so , in their view , like germany ... where the conservative party is ruling ... whoops . 
  what it actually means `` thank god being a massive piece of shit that can spout hate , xenophobia and drops of fascism 24/7 is finally okay again ! '', 
   genuinely think or say that sweden is a hellhole . 
  soo , saying it and then claiming `` but i do n't actually think that way ! '', 
  is fine nowadays ? 
  interesting ... 
  not in the mood for the `` proof '' game . 
  you got access to his twitter like anyone else , i 'm sure you can back-catalogue it to the berlin attack , if he has n't deleted that shit . 
  but , as a [ small appetizer ] ( https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mf2ssqy018rqcljzltxd2w.png ), 
   i never saw this and i would like to see proof first . 
  seriously ? 
  since i know you and him share a lot of similiar thought patterns , i 'm certain you are aware of his remarks and tweets during the berlin attack - [ for example ] ( https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mf2ssqy018rqcljzltxd2w.png ) or others , similiar saying `` this is what the left wants for every city ( referring to riots and attacks in paris ) - hopefully then people will wake up ! '', 
   pointing out problems in europe and pointing out faults within certain cultures is not hateful . 
  ah yes , the constant tweets of `` lul lefties '' and `` see this piece of ` totally unbiased and 100 % true information ' '' - no , great way to point out `` problems '' . 
  in the meantime he also makes a whole bunch of shit up to support his agenda while openly saying that he is `` hoping for terrorist attacks '' as well as spreading his hateful rhetoric . 
  fuck that guy . 
  yes , his twitter account . 
  good ol' language has evolved and ` racism ' has been used in that context since more than 20 years . 
   it is the eu 's fault by the way * riiight * , it 's the eu 's fault that greece faked their entire state of economy pretty much and then presented that . 
  aight then . 
  going from `` rape waves '' and `` hundreds of crimes , murders and rapes '' to `` here are some crimes , crazy right , they do happen '' i made my point , have a nice day . 
  the problem here is that not every job grants healthcare . 
  those are `` half decent '' jobs and considering that there are millions of , what can be considered , minimum wage jobs you do n't get any healthcare from that . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_grenade_attacks_in_sweden widely known as turf-wars between balkan mafias  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_ikea_stabbing_attack oh my god !, 
  it 's a crime !, 
  yes , those do indeed still happen #crimesin 2k17 ( same goes for the one following that )  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_are_sthlm_sexual_assaults  in 2014 and 2015 , 38 incidents of sexual harassment at we are sthlm were reported to the police by female visitors at the festival , most of whom were under 15 years of age kinda weird , how does that fit in if the `` refugee wave '' did not hit till late 2015 ? 
  does n't really make sense now , does it . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_social_unrest_in_sweden oh cool , that kinda thing has been happening since the ... 70 's in germany . 
  first of may is the time when you park your cars in garages and the police brings in thousands of officers from all around the country into the larger cities to keep the rioters and protests in check - guess what , they are white !, 
  oh my god , mind blown . 
  i know right ? 
  it 's insane that young radicals might do such things . 
  kinda unfortunate that the last source especially does not link that unrest to any immigrants , kinda rough for the agenda ... : /, 
  cobra does not just `` cover everything '' though . 
  there are quite a lot of pre-requisites that have to be met and worst case , you got ta fight for it first . 
  which puts the employer in a position of power being held over you . 
  meaning you are `` shackled '' to that job for the sake of your health . 
  ( this is of course hyperbole to a degree ), 
  you do n't get to claim anything that does not belong to you . 
  the eu never signed over ownership of their assets to the uk , thus there is no such claim . 
  oh please , what a bullshit way to argue and you know that . 
   if , let 's says , a few hundred women are raped every new years eve , would that still be acceptable in order to help thousands of refugees ? 
  which is a ridiculous statement * and * question , going to show very nicely that you have no interest in actual debate on the topic . 
  on a sidenote , good thing that is not happening so there is nothing to argue about . 
   to this happening yet , there is n't a whole lot happening . 
  so , you are opposed to the idea of `` not a whole lot '' happening in your country but fervently comment on such a perceived issue in other countries , which you do n't care about . 
  that 's a bit odd , to say the least . 
   what 's wrong is getting thousands of maghrebi , sub-saharan , bangladeshi , whatever , economic migrant you * can * be a refugee even from those countries . 
   you stop accepting 3728 billions of migrants every year hyperbole makes you look ridiculous and secondly , the people are not going away . 
  they do n't just `` dissapear '' as some individuals would like to believe . 
   that means spending more in language courses , professional courses , psychological counsel , etc. 
  resources are finite and should be allocated to solve pre-existing problems . 
  you want language courses , psychological counsel and such for citizens of the country who are third-generation immigrants ? 
  they are part of that issue and have n't been properly assimilated , language courses wo n't change that anymore but rather an in-depth understanding of the actual issue . 
  ( and no , not kneejerk reactions from either you or me who know squat about the academic nature of the problem ) the resources are there to provide such things to new arrivals and while doing so , learning more about the problem itself becomes possible . 
   importing lol  that 's why the incoming flow should be stopped and vetted at the borders . 
  by whom ? 
  italy , greece , spain are failing at it , frontex does no have the capacities or rights to do so and the v4 are blocking more funding while the southern european nations are unwilling to hand over responsibility for the matter . 
   2 - i never said that . 
  [ you sure about that ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5v0cx6/sweden_asks_the_us_to_explain_trump_comment/ddz1j49/ )  could n't care less . 
  ah , well , everyone for themselves . 
  why do you care about sweden then ? 
  you do n't have anything to do with sweden afterall and could not care less . 
   no country has the moral obligation to solve the problem of world crime and poverty yet every country has the lawful obligation of providing refuge . 
  aside from that , what i meant is that it 's not solving the problems outside the eu or inside the eu for properly assimilating people . 
   what country ? 
  countries like greece , italy , spain , hungary , bulgaria , macedonia , croatia , serbia , romania and slovenia . 
  but hey , who cares about the eu or some solidarity anyways . 
   if crime is committed mostly by immigrants it is n't though . 
   particularly if it 's a reduction of the most problematic groups . 
  sooo , all eastern europeans , baltics , balkans , north africans ? 
  well , the number of crimes committed will * lower * but not cease to exist , like you implied . 
  what it is guaranteed to lead to however , is a sharp increase in crime and crisis in another country that is taking these people instead . 
  maybe , that 's not solving the problem long-term though . 
  it 's a short-term solution while fucking over another country and saying `` hah , lol , not our problem fuckheads . 
  have fun ! '', 
   sweden is unique , combine radical islam with feminism and put homosexuals in the spotlight regardless of competence and experience . 
  where `` black people '' are so exotic and amazing they are quota into boards and county offices , top jobs given to them , and normal jobs because of their skin pigmentation , not how hard they studied or behaved as children . 
  man , you and your `` opinions '' are also pretty unique . 
   when i think see and this is where you made your first mistake . . 
   sweden would likely have seen significant falls . 
  an extremely questionable statement considering that crime statistics from balkan , baltic and eastern european nations in sweden are not particularly fluffy and goody either . 
  how are less immigrants going to lead to crime ceasing to exist ? 
  or poverty areas ceasing to exist ? 
   look how the liberals turned it into a shithole . 
  ah , the_donald trumpets , never cease to be a great ( it 's true ) source of amusement . 
  the assumption of op is just wrong and has little to do with fairness . 
  it 's not about being a net contributor , but rather having signed a contract for a budget the country will provide . 
   if it were that easy the eu would n't care about this # 60b . 
  huh ?
