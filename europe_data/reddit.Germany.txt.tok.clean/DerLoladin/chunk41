  what ? 
  that 's the uk 's liability payment as well as pensions . 
  it also goes to show that the eu is not willing to bow to the uk 's wishes . 
  that number has little to do with economic developments or the situation . 
   but it will not survive the demographic shift . 
  lol that 's a funny one, 
  nah just not debating with some `` muh alt-right '' neckbeard talking about things he does not understand . 
  like claiming women decided just in the past two years to carry pepperspray or prefer to be accompanied by male aquintances :'d, 
  you 're a little sad :(, 
  lul that fucking argument about an event 1\u00a01/2 years ago . 
  it 's about daily life you simpleton . 
  article about how russia is likely attempting to undermine efforts of nato and the eu to keep the baltics safe from any russian aggression  demented russophobia yes ... totally russophobia , has no backing comrade xaxa article is news of fake, 
  must be my german guilt speaking . 
  thank you for your insight into german social interactions and tought processes , what would i have done without you ... / s some people and their issues , jesus ... 
   questioning german guilt for the holocaust is a massive transgression . 
  lol no it is n't that fucking retarded `` german guilt '' bullshit . 
   i just wish there was party that offered more realistic and sustainable solutions dealing with the refugee crisis those are being offered , however , afd voters and others with that mindset are not looking for `` realistic '' or sustainable . 
  they want * now * and * fast * which is just not how these things work . 
   the way things are going in germany right now . 
  luckily things are going normal as usual in germany right now . 
  but hey , that must be `` muh white guilt '' speaking - oh do n't forget the white genocide currently going on in sweden and germany :'d, 
  there are no specific haircut rules . 
  you can wear whatever you feel like as long as it is respectful and within regulations . 
  ( so not too long ), 
   you germans are still so entangled in guilt from ww2 that giving up your country to third-world muslims is a task that is seen as obligatory . 
  and * this * is where everyone should stop reading . 
  but hey , good job discrediting yourself . 
   hate circlejerk yes comrade , is only , how you say , `` jerk of circle '' from fascist western homosex pigs xaxaxaxa in truth is all news of fake , propaganda and poor , poor rossya being bullied again by mean homosex fascist pigs ( ( ( ( ( why always poor russia ?!, 
  they so jealous of great nation and great people !!? 1 !?? 
  who is talking about paying anything ? 
  apologizing and recognizing ! = paying up, 
   new majority . 
  funny , i have been to france relatively recently and did not notice a `` new majority '' of people from the former colonies . 
  you must 've visited a different france than the one in europe . 
   white guilt yes , acknowledging historical events for what they are is `` white guilt '' . 
  those are all standard topics in school and there is a huge amount of academical as well as public discourse about these things . 
  yes i 'm certain the people murdered in the genocides in both algeria and vietnam are incredibly thankful . 
   les republicans candidate francois fillon on wednesday denounced what he called `` this hatred of our history , this perpetual repentance that is unworthy of a candidate for the presidency of the republic '' . 
  hah , that 's a funny statement coming from fillon in particular ... 
  to the surprise of exactly no one . 
  i 'm fully expecting more of this crap to pop up with our allied nations as well . 
  here is hoping our baltic allies wo n't swallow that crap . 
   yet they want to shit talk countries last i checked no one is talking on behalf of `` their country '' anywhere , unless that person is an elected official . 
   countries that actually go and defend other countries all over the world throughout its history . 
  oh wow , that 'd be a tough one to find a country like that because it sure as shit ai n't the us . 
   it is comical to not realize the hypocrisy especially from a non nato member . 
  sweden has signed , already 7 months ago , a pledge to nato as well as a support declaration and are well on their way to joining nato . 
  but do n't let me throw rocks in between your agenda ...  if anything they should be concerned about how shit of an ally sweden would be to their european partners they will be and currently are a great partner , actually . 
  considering they are part of the eu and thus also part of inter-eu military structures and cooperation . 
  aside from the fact that this was , like , ** 70 ** years ago , even back then sweden did everything it could while staying neutral in a massive conflict . 
  that includes sending arms , volunteers , funds and ammunition to finland . 
  can you now stop being ridiculous ? 
  thank you . 
  so you just claimed sweden is having one of its neighbours attacked and split apart , but since that is nonsense , you divert . 
  now i got ta ask , which nation in nato or the eu is currently being invaded and split apart ? 
  and the tens of thousands of brits and hundreds of thousands of poles and other european nationalities . 
  afterall , they are all committing crimes . 
   ways that do n't involve suicide . 
  who is committing suicide again ? 
  because the german population is [ committing quite a bit less suicides ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/583/umfrage/sterbefaelle-durch-vorsaetzliche-selbstbeschaedigung/ ) . 
   as if christianity is n't long dead anyway . 
  well , then why were you rambling earlier about our christian party not doing christian things ? 
  all things considered , christianity may or may not be dead but they acted very much so in alignment with christian values . 
  those are all seperate countries , with seperate doctrines and policies , different firearms , different organizations etc. 
  without some sort of unification , beyond using the same ammo type and the nato alphabet , there is no * real * deterrence in this day and age . 
  the common definition of `` left-centre-right '' as is used and applied in most of the world . 
  by that definition , u/skypl is perfectly right . 
  well , in that case we better ban all immigration then . 
  from all nations everywhere . 
  because otherwise we 'd be importing crime . 
  which neighbouring nation of sweden has been invaded with them having an obligation to aid them ? 
   the french needed heavy american assistance in its libya and mali operations . 
  and in return american soldiers get to train in european environments and training facilities . 
  and * oh god * the `` sacrifice '' of 9 transport planes , yuuuuge . 
  which still is a huge misconception . 
  spending more ( in number ) on a military means , practically , nothing without looking at every country individually . 
  by doing so , one will discover that your average russian soldiers earns * a lot * less than their western european counterparts , that equipment and material comes cheaper ( ** a lot ** cheaper ) and that russia is , in certain aspects , a lot more modern than western militaries . 
  spending more on military means nothing , as everything military related in russia is cheap as chips . 
   eastern and western europe newsflash , bulgaria and hungary are pro-russian especially on that issue . 
  good thing no one cares , since you 're not german . 
  aside from that , looking at your comment history i can only say the same about you . 
  aside from you seemingly having an aneurism  the conservatives did nothing conservative or christian have you informed yourself of `` christian values '' ? 
  because if you had , you 'd know that a proper christian would have opened the doors to the refugees much sooner ... but that 's a nice bit that is always left out , whoops . 
  you ever heard of a thing called `` spd '' ? 
  you can see it whatever way you want , that does not make it reality or proper definition . 
   force these parties to put their money where their mouth is . 
  which die linke is known for never doing , quite the contrary . 
  can these volunteer-polls finally stop ? 
  the question asked has no relevance , the demographic has no relevance ( volunteer online poll ) and the matter it is conducted is worthless , especially on an issue like this one . 
  these threads serve as nothing else other than circlejerks for * certain other * subs and get brigaded every . 
  single . 
  time . 
  france has had these issues long before any refugees arrived . 
   in germany , a polish woman was hacked to death by a muslim who refused to accept her rejections of his advances . 
  a homeless guy was put on fire by a bunch of syrian asylum seekers in berlin . 
  and no one cares , because you know what ? 
  these things happen everyday , there is even a name for it - `` crime '' . 
  it is committed by people of all ethnicities , religions and genders . 
   so is not a primary target . 
  please stop , i can only vomit so much .
