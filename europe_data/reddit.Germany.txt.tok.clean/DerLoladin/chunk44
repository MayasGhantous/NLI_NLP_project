  that fact is not up to debate . 
  well , not a whole lot for the eu to do , that 's what you get when everyone is whining and bitching about loosing their sovereignity . 
  if the eu would have intervened earlier , you bet that half the dutchies and most of the polish on this sub would have gotten their knickers in a twist . 
  so , to sum up your opinion . 
  eu nations should get all their sovereignity back and never hand anything in . 
  however , other nations who are outside the eu do n't have any sovereignity and do n't really exist anyways . 
  great mindset , yeah , works fantastic in politics . 
  why deal with people when you can just tell them `` sorry you do n't exist '' . 
  like china and taiwan . 
  there is also always a risk involved with going * outside * , my goodness , why would you put your own children at such a risk ? 
  both the center-right and left-wing parties have been protesting . 
  aside from that , there is n't a whole lot the eu can do outside from withdrawing money from the anti-corruption funding . 
  hush hush now , back to the_donald, 
  berlin ? 
  i have not found a ** single ** good mexican restaurant in berlin ... 
  psssht , equal criticism of everyone is not a law ... 
  as far as i understand it , yes . 
  the only individual left to revoke it is in bed with psd . 
  nah thanks i 'm not censoring myself against far-right idiots . 
  this is n't a court of law you moron . 
  * right * , why trust any official institutions at all . 
  everything is fake news and true at the same time now folks . 
  it 's really easy actually . 
  claim by news outlet a -  check police feed ( for example -  determine if fake news or not . 
  the end . 
  done , already happening before the crisis . 
  has the psd leadership replaced or infiltrated military ranks at all ? 
  my biggest worry is that they could probably drum up a massive media and propaganda campaign in their support , likely with russian assistance , to sway the public opinion . 
   but the shelling has happened only after ukranian troops have violated the minsk agreement by advancing offensively . 
  yet there was shelling already reported 3 days ago . 
   effectively giving power to people advocating for an ethnic cleans of russians and jews in ukraine . 
  i 'd like a source on that , since the only thing i 've ever come across that is anywhere near thr truth is the removal of russian as an official language in eastern ukraine . 
   but it is also planting nato troops in the russian border , which hugely increases tensions between russia and the eu . 
  it 's called a `` reaction '' . 
  eventually you have to react to russia when they are constantly seeing what they can get away with anr probing your defenses . 
  what else is nato supposed to do ? 
  sit by and say `` eh , whatever '' ? 
  trump is a gay reptiloid who comes from the moons of saturn . 
  saying otherwise is censorship . 
  happy ? 
  why would i argue with someone with that name who is well known for being a troll and nothing else ? 
  russian troops * are * in ukraine , that is a fact . 
  russia supplies the rebels , that is a * fact * . 
  and shelling always happens on such * odd * occassions where it just so happens to be beneficial to russia , my , ai n't that just weird . 
  but i 'm sure it must be the ukrainians ... 
  cause the bbc , sz , rferl , al jazeera all are fake news as well . 
  how is that `` vacation '' going for you ? 
  always hate it when i get lost and end up in poland ... ah , the 30 's . . 
  sure , but wan na bet they 'd rather find a hole in the law or , alternatively , just attempt to leave the eu and drag romania with them instead of facing justice ? 
  the eu can sue , but that is about it . 
  no asses being handed to anyone . 
   that 's how i see it as well no russian troops xaxaxa nyet is evil ukrainian fascists doing the shelling !, 
  poor , poor russia innocent !, 
  ( ( ( ( ( fuck off would ya, 
   `` fake news '' is a propaganda term used to silence political opposition . 
  uhm , no . 
  fake news is simply false `` news '' . 
  not at all . 
  populism has been a thing with the old greek and in rome as well , with people making promises and being rabble-rousers . 
  in terms of the protesting and opposition side ? 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
  romania can just decide to not give a shit , like poland . 
  i 'd recommend to leave the basement once or twice a month . 
  inb4 financial `` experts '' and people who `` saw it coming 3000 years ago '', 
   even though it was obvious they cooked the books . 
  well , damn !, 
  so god damn obvious really , anyone could have found out ... weird that they did n't , since it was so obvious . 
   he rambled on for 60 mins on the propaganda tv channel on sunday literally afd voter * and * concerned cititzen . 
  oh it is perfectly legal , just not if you want to adhere to international aviation law . 
  which we do n't have to but * can * do . 
  must be one hell of an odd thread then , because all our helicopters can fly just fine in winter and over water . 
  the `` luftfahrtbeschaffungsamt '' was whining about the nh-90 not fulfilling their vision of a perfect helicopter and that it 's not within international regulations . 
  kinda weird considering every other nation uses the same helicopter for the same jobs just fine . 
  so it 's probably just political bitching and whining . 
   this is a new low in german politics for me . 
  ah-huh ... yeah seems as good a reason as any , concerned citizen . 
   also it would be nice if he would start giving details how already done that , you just got ta , ya know , get out there and find it . 
  i mean , most helicopters do ... 
  since there is n't a whole lot political violence in that regard , i 'd say so yeah . 
  depending on the turk they may or may not be welcomed . 
   nazism could be made into a religion quite easily . 
  anything can be made into a `` religion '' , that does not mean it will be recognised by anyone as such . 
   than nazism was ? 
  i disagree . 
  if you actually believe that then i ** highly ** suggest to read up on some history , ideally since around about the year 100 bc . 
   religion is a set of beliefs it is also belonging to a group and a certain lifestyle . 
  because it is n't . 
  religions are a much larger part of societies and communities at large , they are also something that people have been killed for since hundreds of years . 
  so yeah , not specifically targeting someone because he has religion x is special . 
  oh please  ms. aivazova and other experts say that russia has a serious problem with domestic violence . 
  citing data provided by russia 's interior ministry , ms. aivazova told mr. putin in 2015 that `` 40 percent of all grave violent crimes are committed in families . ''  in 2013 , she said , more than 9,000 women died in criminal assaults and more than 11,000 were badly injured . 
  in 2014 , she said , `` more than 25 percent of all murders were committed in families . '' [ source ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/world/europe/russia-domestic-violence.html?_r=0 ) in comparison :  in the united states , by comparison , 11,766 women were killed by a husband or boyfriend in the years 2001 to 2012 , an average of about 1,000 a year in a country with about twice the population of russia . 
  this new law is equal to a legitimization . 
  there are plenty of stories out there from victims of domestic violence who got flat-out ignored or threatened by the police . 
  no one will help them and no one * wants * to help them . 
  as it can anywhere , but then again , few people take domestic violence very serious in russia . 
  what was it `` if he beats you he loves you '' and all that . 
  unbelievable , absolutely disgusting . 
  do you believe this could mount into political violence ?
