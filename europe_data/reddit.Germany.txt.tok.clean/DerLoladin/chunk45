  good for you m80, 
  [ the economist previously referred to 30.000 $ , which has been edited but the `` serious medical damage '' part is still at the beginning of the article ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21715726-it-fits-traditional-values-lawmakers-say-why-russia-about-decriminalise-wife-beating ), 
  so the government actually stated they will use emergency measures to push their changes through ? 
  no ** substantial ** body harm . 
  meaning as long as the medical costs are below the equivalent of 30.000 $ edit : [ source , 30.000 $ part has been edited , however the `` serious medical damage/bodily harm '' still stands ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21715726-it-fits-traditional-values-lawmakers-say-why-russia-about-decriminalise-wife-beating ), 
  assault and battery -  2 weeks in jail . 
  `` seems harsh '' holy shit, 
  the invasion 40 years ago ? 
  yeah i 'm ** sure ** they were around then ... 
  ethz is on rank 9 . 
  the things you mentioned are interesting , that might be a reason to consider it to be part of the eu 's research and education effort . 
  please elaborate ? 
  in an argument of uk vs. 
  continent it could be considered, 
  missed edinburgh . 
  let me break it down . 
  uk : * oxford * cambridge * imperial college london * university college london * london seps * edinburgh * king 's college eu : * karolinska * lmu munich * ku leuven * heidelberg * wagening u&r * humboldt university and we 're not talking about the top 25 . 
   that 's why there are 8 british universities in the world 's top 50 but only one from the eu . 
  [ nope ] ( https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats ) 6 from the uk , 5 from the eu ( 6 if we count switzerland ) . 
  edit : missed edinburgh and one from the eu . 
   what else ? 
  it is about your personal totalitarian impulse first and foremost . 
  rather about your naive and borderline dangerous worldview functional first and foremost only in your own vision and fantasy of a perfect world . 
   translation : i have never bothered any political science about the mechanics of dictatorships and the safeguards against it . 
  translation : i have no idea what i 'm talking about thus i revert to personal attacks against my opponent . 
  good job bruh . 
   while most examples of democracies show the greater the degree of expression and press freedom , the harder it is to subvert . 
  i keep hearing `` most '' and `` almost all '' as well as `` every '' . 
  generalisation is a dangerous game . 
  aside from that , a democracy that says `` everything is a go '' will end up falling in the times of crisis due to the emergence of radical political movements and the split of society . 
  but that probably does n't fit your worldview so why am i even bothering . 
   oppressing those different from you . 
  except they are not . 
  they are free to share any ideas and values they hold in private , however , if their views are unconstitutional , they will not be tolerated but are free to go somewhere where that is not the case . 
  allowing ideology to spread freely has brought down entire empires and kingdoms who did not took it serious enough , i for one am quite happy with the the laws and would rather not see the state subverted by far-right or far-left ideologies . 
   most countries with high degrees of freedom never descedned into dictatorships that 's not what this is about . 
   `` wehrhafte demokratie '' is at far greater statistical risk of becoming subverted than free societies . 
  uuuuhm , that is a highly questionable statement at best . 
   and those who only understand the history of a single country in a single situation , and only take a single lesson are those who have learned nothing . 
  well , all the better that i 'm not the one doing so , but rather taking a lesson from all over the world and the emerging political movements and reactions there . 
  it 's kinda funny considering that people talked that exact talk in the 20 's as well , when there was n't such a thing as a `` wehrhafte demokratie '' . 
  that worked out * great * . 
  guess it is really true that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it . 
   that what freedom of opinion means . 
  no , it does n't . 
  you can have any views and opinions that you want , as long as you keep them * to yourself * . 
  as soon as you publicise them , that right does no longer apply if you break a law/go against the constitution . 
   democracy and liberty as well . 
  you should try it . 
  educate yourself on neopluralism , you should try it . 
  laws = anti-democratic , good to know aside from that , no , a society does not have to tolerate views that are directly opposed to the values of the state and democracy . 
  neopluralism is a great thing . 
  the people of austria and germany disagree . 
  i 'm fascinated , but also highly disturbed ... 
  do n't lie , you know you love the attention from [ this hot boi ] ( http://imgur.com/a/odth6 ) fam , 
  do we ? 
  hey poland , u want sum anschluss bby ? 
  you 're looking at ultra-nationalism , not religion . 
  hell , the whole `` religious '' argument is mostly just an excuse . 
  mr. macron seems to have something that is very lacking with most leaders these days - vision . 
  i 'm glad that he is a candidate to lead an important and influential nation like france , here is hoping the french people will be wise enough to see someone who will * truly * benefit them and the continent , rather than feed their anxieties and fears with nonsense . 
   germany controls it we control the europe ? 
  again , why have i never been told this ?!, 
  d :  if you ca n't see that i dont predict good things for the future of the eurozone if there is always someone else at fault then i predict bad things for the future of southern europe as well . 
   lithuania is dying as a nation can any lithuanians chip in ? 
  are you dead yet ? 
   the right wing/conservative electorate obviously . 
  that is not necessarily true , considering that there are plenty of greens and lefts in the brussel and they voted against it as well . 
  there was such a measure in the parlament , it was thrown out by almost everyone there except 5 members , i believe . 
  so , while i 'd be all for anti-corruption blaming it on germany is just ... so far beyond ridiculous . 
   a certain electorate which one ? 
   your country is slowly killing every bit of sanity that there is in europe . 
   is always at our expanse  but your 4th reich will end  who thinks that democracy exists in the eu damn son , you got it * bad *, 
   almost every law redacted these days is supervised by european bureaucrats just like germany  germany ( i mean , the eu ) decides who passes through our borders uhm , no . 
   germany decides on which kind of industry we invest or tax . 
  why did no one ask me then d :  germany decides which laws are enforced or not . 
  lol this whole post of yours would be really quite funny , if it were n't so sad since you seem to actually believe all of that . 
   by all means pass anti corruption measures !, 
  persecute judicially portuguese politicians and bankers that embezzle and steal money from the eu . 
  and who is going to decide that ? 
  it 's a democratic system after all , one country alone ca n't do shit when the rest says `` nah thanks , we do n't give a damn '' . 
  do n't mention that sub , reeeeeeeeeee, 
  `` muh fiscal union !!! 111 ! '', 
  well , then i 'm afraid you 'll have to give up a bit of your sovereignity : / `` never !, 
  south europe stronkest nations !, 
  great nations , best nations ! '', 
  but hey , i 'm sure it 'll work eventually, 
  wow , now i 'm hurt :(, 
  `` i want to have my cake and also eat it ! '', 
  that 's not how it works ... 
  keep in mind , those numbers do likely come together from afd voters and die linke voters , so 10 % should n't be all that surprising . 
  sure worked out great before , when we tried that for over 10 years . 
  perhaps i misunderstood you , thought your original comment was meant negatively or in a sarcastic way ( since that is very common in * these * kinda threads ), 
  there is a limit to how much you can sentence a juvenile for . 
  very powerful , god damn . 
  well , our populist-right does n't get 20 % in polls luckily . 
   you can have more than one culture . 
  hahahahaha . 
  that 's great , no seriously , really funny . 
   there are honour killings in iran , not to the same degree as in other countries in the middle east but they do still happen hundreds of times every year .
