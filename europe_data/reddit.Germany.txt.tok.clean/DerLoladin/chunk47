  and because of its size , it would leave little to rest of the union . 
  you seem to view this as an instantanous process , when in reality the russian government would be a lot less corrupt , has gone through serious reforms and spends a lot less money on its military . 
  sure , it will be a gradual process but the people in the far corners of siberia do n't need new highways . 
  a russia with solid economic reforms that * cooperates * with europe instead of trying to oppose it and with a functional , non-authoritarian government will have more than enough money for a lot of the internal works . 
   geopolitically , russia sees itself as a power on its own . 
  they 've already created multiple organizations copying eu , but with former ussr states , and have rather open been about them being rivals to the eu . 
  as i said , such a scenario would only ever be realistic if russia dropped the `` we must oppose `` the west '' ! '', 
  mentality . 
   finally , russia is also too different . 
  ** vehemently ** disagree with this entire paragraph . 
   like their love for autocracy since a hundred years they do n't know anything else , however , like every nation ever this will change once the economy picks up . 
  russians are already getting `` westernized '' through the internet and such . 
   glorification of soviet union i have not met a single russian glorifying or even saying a single good word about the soviet union . 
  this opinion tends to come from either old people , closet communists or the russian propaganda machine centered around putin . 
  and on the topic of old people , we still have those glorifying the gdr in germany or the nazis . 
   `` family values '' not sure what you mean , if you 're hinting at their discrimination of homosexuals then i 'd like to point squarily at countries like poland or bulgaria . 
   it 's just a full membership is not realistic for them . 
  instead , we should aim for some other cooperation mechanisms . 
  not yet , anyways . 
  mere cooperation will always lead to a change in leadership ( be it in the eu or russia ) to revert back to the old times . 
  there needs to be substantial shift in perception and understanding of one another , a shift that can only happen through serious economical cooperation and the integration of european values ( which a lot of ee countries still struggle with ) into the russian mindset . 
  for now , russia has alienated itself as they do best . 
  which is favorable for the regime as it allows them to spin everything the way of `` it 's all the wests fault ! '' . 
  but that 's not how it has to be till the end of times and times * will * change eventually . 
   how is a trade agreement going to help bring peace to the region ? 
  it was not about a trade agreement but rather , starting talks about ukrainian eu ascension . 
  ( which is nowhere near them joining ) aside from that though , conflict is almost always about material objects . 
  europe has had over 2000 years of conflict because of that and thanks to the precurser of the eu in the 50 's , waves have smoothed and we have the longest period of peace * ever * on this continent . 
  if everyone prospers , there is no conflict . 
   would n't it promote tension between the eu and russia , leading to a greater risk of conflict ? 
  that risk is by russias own actions , not through the eu . 
  just like ukraine , russia has the option of joining the eu eventually , yet they rather pursue dreams of dominance of europe . 
  and really , even without ukraine the tensions could not be much higher . 
   i fail to see why the ukrainian civil war is particularly important it 's not so much about the civil war itself and much more so about the status-quo in ukraine as well as the instability that is plaguing the nation . 
  via closer contact to the eu , we could stabilise the country and move it along the way of the rest of eastern europe . 
  meaning russia has no way of destabilising europe any longer without directly provocing a conflict with nato and the eu and we can work on the corruption that is plaguing ukraine , assisting those who want to get rid of it with funds and professional advisers . 
   why europe should further antagonise russia in the name of `` stability '' . 
  russia * chooses * to be antagonized , it needs that image of the west and europe for its own propaganda purposes . 
  it 's not something that europe can really pay attention to as it 's the equivalent of stopping the shopping mall and talking for 30 minutes to the enranged toddler , because he could n't get the pudding he wanted . 
  russia will either adapt or be left out , which is why conflict in ukraine is so important to them and which is also why they push so heavily on the propaganda front . 
  further , especially now with the us being a questionable ally at best , it 's go hard or go bust for the eu . 
  [ much worse i 'm afraid , it 's time france ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/france_map_lambert-93_with_regions_and_departments-occupation.svg/2000px-france_map_lambert-93_with_regions_and_departments-occupation.svg.png ) edit : / s for fucks sake, 
  til the eu is literally mercantile german globalist propaganda / s, 
   on the periphery of europe ? 
  only 20 years ago people considered poland to be on the `` periphery '' of europe . 
  aside from that , it 's not about the `` core nations '' being wealthy and prosperous , but everyone who takes part . 
   what are the political gains no conflict . 
  times without conflict are an * enormous * boost for development , both as a society as well as economically . 
  a safe and stable country with plenty of population in need of work is a godsend for any companies looking to invest and expand . 
  in the same fashion it benefits the eu as a whole and countries who would be considered to be in the `` core '' . 
  conflict in romania , for example , would create huge waves all the way into germany and france , making the eu itself as well as the economical situation in europe more unstable . 
  you 're one of the few people i 'd really to love to just bugger off with their uninformed opinion . 
  romania has done [ a lot against corruption ] ( http://www.mai-dga.ro/index.php?l=en ) , polands economy has picked up insane speeds with the help of eu investments , the entire east is getting more and more developed , hell , even ahead of the west in certain ways . 
  but yes , everyone is corrupt and needs bribes in ee . 
  it 's kinda scary how susceptible the dutch seem to be for the anti-eu populism - taking a page or two from the people across the canal eh ... 
   do n't need an annual bribe . 
  lol , right because that money is n't at all invested back into their economy which , in turn , profits the economy of the rest of the eu aside from the political gains that we have from stabilising that region comprehensively and long-term through a stable partnership and development . 
  yeeeaaaah , that data for poland , portugal and ireland is not * really * representative of reality . 
  that 's just the official data , the numbers are crazy high . 
  polish women go to lithuania or even germany for an abortion , but of course that is not part of this data . 
   everyone is always under propaganda `` attacks '' from everywhere . 
  the more i read your replies the more apparent it becomes that your first accusation towards me is actually applicable to you . 
  in that case , why is it called a `` ddos attack '' ? 
  and not a `` ddos incidence '' ? 
  russia and the west are in an electronic warfare arms race since at least 5 years now . 
  same goes for propaganda , probably even more dangerous than a war itself , since it brings along ideology and division . 
  the long-term effect can be devastating . 
  the fact that you , someone from iceland are so concerned about a war , when the truly devastating issue is propaganda and an emerging fascist movement , has a certain humor to it . 
  [ much ? 
  greece already had huge amounts of its debt written off ... repeatedly . 
  you dreamed of bringing back the death penalty as a teenager ? 
  damn , you 're kinda fucked up . 
   because we are not being attacked you must be living under a rock . 
  austria is extremely anti-military or defensive partnership anyways, 
   geopolitics is a constant game of power grabs to dominate the other . 
  you have a pretty pessimistic and extremely flawed perception of geopolitics . 
  no , one can become a superpower for defensive reasons as to guarantee the safety of their citizens . 
  the important bit is to not mix it with ideology . 
  you can amass power without using it in a war , rather , as a projection of influence . 
  ahuh and where exactly will they be housed in the baltics ? 
  how will you move the infrastructure there and worst of all ... * why * ? 
  the baltics are not asia , it 's pretty close . 
  there is nothing left driving germans and french apart . 
  seriously , relations between the people of our nations have never been better . 
   we already have everything we need to survive . 
  and * that * is where you are wrong . 
  when you look at current politics , how there are foreign-funded movements aiming to break up the eu everywhere , you will realise that what we have right now is a very precious position and one that others want to do away with . 
  because if europe unites under one flag , we will be the most influential and promising area on the globe in every regard ** and ** more importantly , will be unable to be torn apart by outside forces looking to sway the balance of power . 
  make no mistake , `` europe '' as a project for the continent is not something that is guaranteed . 
  one has to fight for it and less and less people are willing to do so . 
  kinda funny how everyone would take arms for their neighbour , but not much further . 
  poles would defend baltics , germans would defend poles , france would probably defend poland but most definitly germany and so on ... 
  let 's ban alcohol and tobacco as well then , while we 're at it . 
  extremely unlikely since it can replace regular medication , which tends to be much more expensive . 
  do n't worry , we did something similiar [ before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crusade_of_1197 ) , we got you [ covered , fam  ] ( http://www.trbimg.com/img-55945b28/turbine/la-fg-greece-debt-crisis-positions-20150701 ), 
  [ 1234-1260 best years of my life !, 
  remove slavic heretics , hail catholicism !, 
   it is in no way justified at all . 
  uhm , yeah it is . 
  quit being an arsehole .
