   all the persons did n't brake a single law . 
  right , because in that case the police would go ham on them . 
   and he decided to be their judge and use the internet to cause a nice dose of grievance in their lives . 
  `` a nice dose of grievance '' as if anyone gave a shit about this website , worst case scenario they can have the picture removed and then think again if they want to be a disrespectful fuckwit and debate , whether some monuments actually `` mean something '' . 
  ** if ** there were ever a scenario where that became realistic , i do n't think the people would care too much as long as the process is democratic and peaceful . 
  then again , my post was a joke . 
  how dare the * fascists * and nazis in ukraine overthrow this man , who is the gold-standard of democracy and the savior of his people !, 
  hey i know that guy !, 
  he is former afd , extremely eurosceptic and flat-out anti-eu . 
  bit of a hypocrit to send that letter , especially in that wording . 
  not really ... at all . 
  germany is still one of the most influential nations in all of europe , if not * the most * influential nation . 
   a monument to hypocrisy . 
  well , it does n't really . 
  but not in a sense of numbers but rather how it was done , the industrial nature of it . 
  what a bunch of horseshit . 
   `` what * a bunch of * attention-seeking assholes . '', 
  ftfy, 
  well , that 's because they * are * assholes . 
  they post their pictures online and he uses them , tough shit . 
  well , if that were true we would n't have had ww2 and west-germany would not have turned into western europes largest and fastest growing economy . 
  not really in comparison , think about how long it took prussia to develop into the powerhouse that it turned out to be and then consider how long it took a unified germany to get back on its feet after every world war . 
   ` german framework ' not really , especially the religious divide was pretty extreme and the constant wars also were n't all that great . 
  to that i can only say ... [ you 're totally right !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/second_world_war_europe_1941-1942_map_en.png ) / s, 
  there were no `` germans '' prior to unficiation . 
  there were bavarians , w\u00fcrrtemberger , saxons , westphalians , prussians etc. 
  unification was something that had been coming a long time and was sought after by most people in the german states . 
  when that finally came about it turned germany from one day to the next into the single most powerful nation on the european continent . 
  ( russia was still decades away from modernisation , austria was just ... well and france was still picking up the pieces ), 
  it certainly had an influence but , from my perspective , the mindset was less important in comparison to the actions of their governments . 
  the british democratisation was probably the smoothest while the french one fell apart half-way through but came out on top at the end . 
  in germany it failed all over the place and when the weimar republic came about , it was thrown into a time of post-war turmoil and a breeding ground of different ideologies , none of them too happy with the idea of a moderate democratic system . 
   no offence but you sound like russia is some destructive entity which solo purpose is to bring chaos and suffering at earth . 
  then the same would apply to the us . 
  they are both large nations trying to further their foreign policy and worldview . 
  where the us has the means to often do it through government channels , russia ( due to a lack of influence with european governments ) has to do it through intimidation and shows of force . 
   based on equal partnership while the rest is true as an `` end goal '' , this part is just simply not true and , apologies , but you must be naive if you actually believe that . 
   in 1954 ussr requested admission to nato and was declined of course it was !, 
  the thought of the soviet union , who had nothing in common or any interest in the rest of europe joining a strategic defensive organization is ridiculous . 
  they just brutally crushed a worker uprising in eastern germany one year prior where the entire world watched . 
  3 years earlier they supported north korea in the korean war . 
   so it was not an alliance with purpose to prevent war with ussr and never claimed to be . 
  it was an alliance to defend europe from the soviet union , should they attack . 
   in 1991 that purpose lost all sense the exact same purposes still stands strong - mutual defense . 
  does n't matter if it 's against russia , iran or some other nation . 
   i do n't think there exists an argument that will stop most russians and me aswell think of nato as of that destructive entity as i mentioned soooo ... a defensive alliance that exists merely to defend it 's members against an aggressive state as well as act as an deterrent and unify european nations in a common defense is a `` destructive entity '' ? 
  that is a very , ** very ** odd way of looking at it . 
   but even so , trying to influence in nato 's hypothetical disband by force is again just quite the opposite of what may give a positive result . 
  again , there are many tools in the box . 
  military agression by itself might be pointless , yet mix it with a bunch of large political movements that are extremely pro-russia , a * shitload * of propaganda and just the right moment ... and you can end up with just the perfect combination .

  prussia greattst countrey / s, 
  oh we 're playing that game ? 
  aight . 
  elsa\u00df-lothringen is rightful reichclay !, 
  return k\u00f6nigsberg to ~ ~ prussia ~ ~ germany and half of poland !, 
  the chapter is closed and it has come to the point that anyone using `` german guilt '' in their argumentation automatically also discredits him or herself . 
  there is no `` self-loathing '' nor is every german feeling some kinda `` guilt '' about the past . 
  it is remembered , it is taught in schooles because it is part of our history and unlike other nations , we do n't hide that away from the generations to come to make ourselves feel better . 
  germany as a nation does not have to look up to anyone nor do we have to hide something and yes , that makes me proud . 
  keep in mind that these disputes back then were mostly people shouting `` rightful polish clay ! '', 
  and `` rightful german clay ! '', 
  at one another . 
  so it 's not like the issue was clear cut . 
  from the perspective of a polish nationalist it was completely justified while from bismarcks perspective those were people actively working against german interest . 
   get back what 's theirs again , `` get back what 's theirs '' is highly dependent on your point of view . 
  because , unlike russia , western europe has widely banned such practices since we consider certain treaties we signed to actually be in effect and not only `` technicalities '' . 
  but even then a dutch , german or french soldier in russia would stick out like a pink unicorn in london . 
  the accent is very distinct and they also look nothing alike . 
  furthermore , there is no such thing as an `` ethnic european '' community on russias border . 
  yes !, 
  indeed german citizen , i am sitting in the bundestag right now trolling accounts worldwide with the glorious speech of great leader merkel !, 
  her teachings are a boon to us all and none shall question dear leader . 
  / s now , keep on voting afd and praise h\u00f6cke for `` finally critizising those filthy jews and their monument in berlin !, 
  you heard it here first folks , dress up some soldiers in fatigues and remove their markings , roll them into alsac-lorraine and tell them to `` better vote for annexation ! '', 
  - afterall , that 's obviously the will of the people . . jesus christ dude . 
   however , there need to be certain values in the minds of the population for that propganda to work . 
  not necessarily . 
  you can condition a population , no matter the values , simply because of their national identity . 
  as i said , the dolchsto\u00dflegende was extremely popular due to being directly supported by the ( former ) ohl , attacked those who were seen as `` opponents of the war '' from the start and fueled the anti-jewish sentiment that was alive and well in all of europe anyways . 
   another big hint is the justice system during the weimar republic i 'd say that is less of an issue with society and has more to do with the many , many flaws the weimar republic had . 
  it allowed for exactly that to happen . 
   another big hint is the justice system during the weimar republic personally , i do n't see the treaty as a huge reason for hitlers rise to power , more of a. . . catalyst for his propaganda , something he could remind the people of to stir nationalism and `` revenge '' feeling . 
  funny that , considering we are talking about this in a thread about the proclamation of the empire in versailles .
