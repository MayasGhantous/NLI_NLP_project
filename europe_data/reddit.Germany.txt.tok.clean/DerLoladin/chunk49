   well , this was really what the parliament had decided what they decided * there * . 
  not what could have been 5 years later . 
  ( i do n't remember when election would have been ), 
   yeah because countries like estonia , lithuania and latvia were such a powerhouse at that time that russia could n't even touch them . 
  indeed they were , but in a different sense . 
  the russian military was in no position to wage a war against ... well , * anyone * . 
  an invasion of any of the baltic nations would have likely lead to mass protests and unrest in russia as well as a massive resistance movement within the baltic nations , not even considering the likely assistance of the western european nations and the eastern european states like poland . 
   a counter argument would be great instead of pointless comment like this very well . 
  russia has invested ** massively ** in its military the recent years , modernising left , middle , right and center . 
  a lot of these developments are not flashy and `` big '' like the armata , but they are nonetheless extremely important . 
  aside from properly centralising their command structure they have done away with morale issues , streamlined logistics and brought along equipment standardisation . 
  they developed their sf program to quite a bit and are pioneering tactical electronic warfare , in which they are miles ahead of even the us . 
  put that in context to the larger strategy for taking crimea and the potential this has for insurgencies in neighbouring nations , the threat is rather significant . 
  furthermore , the only way to defend eastern europe in the first place is via assistance from the us , which is all but guarantueed nowadays . 
  hell , it 's not even guarantueed that nations like spain , portugal , italy , the uk , france , germany and so on will assist . 
   russia ca n't dominate the west oh but they can . 
  a strong russia with a broken and divided europe will have an easy game time with western europe . 
  keep in mind , i 'm not talking about invasion . 
  but as i said , the economic ties as well as the military threat are massive . 
  should the us decide on an isolationist path , russia might very well completely dismantle nato and with an attack on eastern europe , the eu is likely to collapse as well . 
   do n't spend the 2 % ( ? ), 
  of their gdp that is required in nato there is no 2 % requirement , there was a mutual agreement * 2 years ago * that all nato members would spent that much , it is not binding nor writen in any contract . 
  let me ask you , does alsac-lorraine belong to germany ? 
  is karelia finnish or russian ? 
  if you make a case for crimea i can make you 50 cases for other territorial disputes who 'd , under that definition , be `` justified to take military action '' . 
   institutionalized colonial policies like bismarck policies in greater poland where not really completely uncontroversial then . 
  yet it was not something special either . 
  especially considering the open support of polish nationalists for france in the franco-prussian war and calling for poles to desert the prussian army , the measures taken after are not particularly special for an empire of that time . 
  bismarck certainly had a special dislike of the poles ( hatred one might even say , but that takes it a bit far tbh ) but there was a reason for it . 
   france the french revolution did not give * birth * to france . 
  it existed long before that . 
   great-britain not any more or less militaristic than any other nation , with the added bonus of a world-spanning empire that held extremely tight onto its power over their colonies . 
   this mindset did not come out of nowhere . 
  if you grow up in a society , you get molded by it . 
  while true and the german empire certainly had a different society than some other nations , it was not that vastly different . 
   the non-democratic , anti-liberal mindset of many germans was a key reason i 'd argue this due to the extreme presence of propaganda during the first world war as well as in the post-war years . 
  if the people are told till the very last day that `` victory is imminent '' , then they surrender and their new government signs a treaty that is paraded up and down as `` unfair and ridiculous !, 
  '' , seeing the new government as unable to keep the peace as well as facing the extreme economic difficulties ... hell , i 'd go so far as to claim that * any * country with the same events transpiring would likely slip . 
  no matter the specific views of society . 
   the vision for a united germany that the paulskirchenparlament had was a moderate one . 
  they still wanted to keep the monarchy . 
  unless they would have gone all out radical-liberal-socialist which is , again , something one can not predict . 
  the vision might have been a moderate one , yet , no one can guarantee the success of that vision and not the success of a more radical right-wing or left-wing parlament . 
  first of all , consider that nato is not one unified state with a single military where everyone uses the same parts , speaks the same language , has the same standard of training and the same equipment . 
  this is * incredibly * important . 
  next up is the issue that nato is currently in a very rough state . 
  the defence of eastern europe was always a matter of being reliant on the us , as germany , france and the uk are unlikely to hold it alone . 
  this is even more true now , yet it looks more and more unlikely for the us to assist and uphold article 5 , should such a scenario come about . 
  ( even the uk is questionable ) furthermore , everyone only considers russia a threat in the sense of a full-blown invasion , yet it 's much more than that . 
  consider the tactics used in crimea and eastern ukraine a first taste of what * could * be to come , a new development in warfare that sparked huge debates and studies in us defence circles . 
  unmarked troops springing up in ethnic russian areas and proclaim `` is all rightful russian clay now ! '', 
  is very , very dangerous indeed . 
  such a situation would have huge consequences for the eu and nato , should it occur in estonia , latvia or lithuania . 
  also , keep in mind that russia has about 12.000 - 15.000 tanks , many of the just in storage and unupgraded with their modernised upgrade packages . 
  no matter how many maps and stats you put in this sub , people will still think numbers are the only thing that matters and then make stupid comments about it . 
  those tanks are relatively easily upgraded though . 
  that is why it 's important to list them as well , their upgrade potential is still significant . 
   trying to take a bite of the most powerful military alliance in the history of mankind is another . 
  and who is going to guarantuee the assistance and upholding of article 5 ? 
  the us ? 
  the uk ? 
  france ? 
  germany ? 
  eastern europe can not be defended without the us and it 's questionable at best whether the uk would assist . 
   if russia ever wanted to `` take back '' countries that were occupied by soviets they would do it before these nations joined nato ? 
  they could n't . 
  the eastern bloc joined nato around 2004 , 14 years in which russia was in shambles alongside its military . 
  they simply could n't . 
   but at the same time i do n't understand why people fear it now more than ever before . . 
  this has got to be a joke ...  russia actually wants to be allied with the west . 
  in a way , yes . 
  the difference is that russia wants to * dominate * the west . 
  their aim is a superior and controlling position through both economic ties and military threat over western europe . 
  that 's why their divide and conquer approach in the recent years is rather scary . 
   they actually have a case for it there is no case . 
  that was tried and failed multiple times , as russia has not a reliable partner to negotiate with . 
  those cards were on the table until the georgian war . 
  there is a great many reasons . 
  for example , the opportunity to break up nato and the eu . 
  waging war , especially the `` little green men '' - war in the eastern borders , with a huge propaganda campaign to keep other nato members of european nations from assisting the targetes nation . 
  it is already debatable whether france , germany , italy , spain , portugal , the netherlands ( especially ) and so on would assist an eastern european nation should they invoke article 5 . 
   do n't overestimate russian military forces there is no overestimation , but a faulty look at tactics . 
  the russian military is , first of all , a ** unified ** military . 
  meaning no one can back out , it 's one country with one military , very much unlike nato . 
  secondly , the russian tactics are highly reliant on tactical nuclear weapons as well as electronic warfare , in which they are ( for now ) unique and have vastly more expertise . 
  that 's not what it 's about . 
  as a rich , powerful and influential nation germany has the * duty * to fulfill it 's role in europe as a defensive force for smaller states . 
  just like france , italy and great britain have/had such a role . 
  again , drawing comparisons between modern times and standards and the past is ridiculous . 
  such was the status quo at the time . 
  hot damn , you are a * special * kinda snowflake are n't you ... 
   born from militarism , regressive-conservatism and authoritarian thoughts such was the norm during these days . 
  drawing a comparison between modern times and the past is faulty at best and naive and stupid at worst . 
   ultimately , it led to the rise of fascism in germany by laying its foundations . 
  that is a * very * dubious statement . 
  the rise of fascism had many facettes and many ways of how it came about , saying there is a single cause for it is ridiculous . 
   its a national tragedy that the revolution of 1848 was a failure . 
  if only it succeeded , germany could have been a liberal state with a very different development . 
  extremely questionable . 
  possible , but questionable .
