  germany was not britain , there could have been an alliance of anti-liberal governments ( so , all of them ) against germany and that would 've been the end of that . 
  again , there is no go-to solution or vision of an alternate future . 
  lol what, 
  always keep in mind people that merkel ** herself ** is sitting right infront of all those screens , watching ** you ** !, 
  yes , indeed , she is the bnd incarnate !, 
  such attempts were made and then russia went `` hah , was trick !, 
  now 1v1 me in rl georgia ! '', 
  yeah , it is a solution . 
  maybe not the best one but it is * some * future . 
  you might want to find an employer first and talk to them about moving . 
  some employers offer financial assistance in moving or provide you with a document for a good loan at a bank . 
  rule of thumb : do n't buy a french car unless you absoloutly have to or own a mechanics shop . 
   definitely not in the lada category . 
  all hail the glorious [ trabbi ] ( http://img2.promobil.de/trabbi-ddr-fahrzeug-fotoshowbigimage-18e76e31-235718.jpg ) !, 
  ( yes , i know its not a lada ), 
   i have no money , no girlfriend , probably no future then move , you got a european pass , you can go and live/work anywhere . 
   i keep matching with russians in wow pvp . 
  now that 's just your fault for playing pvp # ( former ) pvemasterrace, 
   it 's the only way we 'll regain controls on eu immigration and lawmaking . 
  hate to break it to ya ... 
  funny you should say that , considering that a large quantity of ford models are not available in europe . 
  like the taurus , flex , explorer , expedition , all of the suv 's and trucks . 
  also , 2011 is * not * a particularly long time . 
  furthermore , there are still quite a few differences in the interior . 
  this change from ford , as to sell the european vehicles on both sides of the pond , comes from an adaption in the us market though . 
  highly influenced by japanese products . 
  well , that definition has no basis in reality , unfortunately . 
  apparently you ca n't . 
  they also need new engines , new interiors , new frames etc. 
  because no one wants the american build stuff aside from iconic things like the mustang or the occasional idiot with a dodge v8 flatbed import . 
  again , lower class luxury cars are an oxymoron . 
  no one will call them that or perceive them that way . 
  a kia is n't and will never be a luxury car , nor will a fiat or a renault or vw . 
  can you read ? 
  'cause i 'd urge you to reread my comment . 
  the customer for luxury cars does n't agree . 
  ford ** europe ** , they specifically design and build cars for the european market . 
  * right * because there are loads of us cars on our streets . 
  oh no wait ... 
  a toyota is n't a luxury car and will never be , yet a lexus is . 
  a vw will never be a luxury car ( that 's why no one bought the phaeton ) yet audi is . 
  it 's not merely about equipment but also about brand and recognition . 
  ownage = !, 
  origin, 
  what are fake news ? 
  really ? 
  how about `` is it true ? 
  yes/no '', 
  dat shill comment though and others wonder why people like you get downvoted, 
  who is talking about periphery ?!, 
  it 's about how many want to actively * move * , the largest influxe that australia sees is from those fleeing from myanmar . 
   secondly , europe has way more people , manpower and resources than australia to implement a solution . 
  ah yes , if only europe were federalised . 
  but it is n't , so that 's a moot point . 
   `` some random islands '' ? 
  yes . 
  and no , i will not go into further detailed as to how many , how large , what they are named and which facilities are build on them . 
  you can go look that up yourself . 
  yes , because that allways works out perfectly . 
  see north korea or cuba . 
  aside , how would we do that ? 
  invasion ? 
  perfect idea !, 
  reset the clock to 2003 !, 
  numbers and size . 
  australia only has to worry about their north west , has a cooperative partner in indonesia and has to deal with a great many less smugglers . 
  hell , they even have random islands where they can just put those they pick up . 
  italy , on the other hand , has none of these things . 
  that 's such a lame excuse just so one does not have to take a look and analyse the reasons behind russia 's actions . 
  it has nothing to do with being ` barbarians ' but is calculated action . 
  you are comparing australia to italy ? 
  jesus christ dude . . 
  hey another spandauer !, 
  yeah the snow - ` storm ' around midday was pretty nice but since berlin is berlin that stuff does n't stay for long . 
  the uk also had that great idea of dumping their barrels into lakes and the canal . 
  are we doing that ? 
  ( hint : the answer is no ) there is a small difference between actively polluting your water supply , and sealing hazardous material away in blocks of concrete . 
  and russia will not see a whole lot of problems as they have so much space that no one has to care what is sealed off under the ural , as no person will likely ever come in contact with it . 
   acting like this is no problem just seems mindboggling to me . 
  oh it is a problem , just not one that 's unsolvable or unsafe to such levels where people would rather power up coal plants instead . 
  those `` negative '' consequences are allways something that is `` potential '' or `` might happen '' . 
  hell , a god damn meteor could crash down on earth and eliminate all life on earth , does n't mean it has to happen . 
  throwing nuclear waste under a mountain or into some old mine that we seal off with concrete is as safe as any other solution , until technology has progressed far enough that we can recycle that stuff fully . 
  which will happen eventually . 
   atomic waste is probably a bigger problem than air pollution yeah , i mean really , it 's the nuclear wastes fault that the poles are melting ... 
  nuclear * does * solve the problems with coal until there is a suitable alternative , as i have said two times before already . 
  but since renewable energy is nowhere near the point of sustaining a country like germany , switching nuclear power off gave us all the negatives and none of the positives . 
  but hey , great win for the environment !, 
   turning off nuclear plants is the right thing to do so switching to coal is also the right thing to do ? 
  'cause that 's the only other reliable source of power that we have . 
  but hey , at least we do n't have nuclear energy anymore !, 
  just rising pollution levels , contamination of the ground and natural water supply through the coal mines and extremely spiking energy prices . 
  on the other hand , one could have waited until there was a better , renewable solution instead of jumping on the ( beyond short-sighted ) `` no more nuclear power !, 
  in berlin right now , there is a bit of white but no more than half a centimeter . 
  germany as well, 
  yeah brown coal is much better , especially considering how healthy it is for the surrounding communities !, 
  no , truly , i do n't know why anyone would ** not ** recommend brown coal as the only energy source , the lobby pays ve - ... oh , i mean the people want it of course !, 
  that has ... absoloutly , positively and most certainly * nothing * to do with what i said . 
  but alright , i guess ? 
  oh you mean like your assumption that racism equals fascism ?
