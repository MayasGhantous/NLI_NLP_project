  yeah , that was pretty idiotic by you , i agree . 
   wriggle your way out of acting idiotic funny , coming from someone who sees his interpretation of something as the only and true way of viewing something . 
  yeah , right . 
  except i did n't you just chose to interpret it that way and then project your interpretation on me . 
  but keep on trucking , 
  he can be interpretted as a fascist , but i can spin it the exact same way of him `` protecting the community from foreigners who occupy their jobs and thus weaken the working class '' which turns him into a communist . 
  my goodness who woulda thought that one can pick bits and pieces out of ideologies . 
   have a say on their own nationhood . 
  they do , that 's what the state , among other things , is for . 
   so every group of people should have to bow to the power of demographics that 's quite literally the exact thing that would happen in an area with such a system in place . 
  everyone who is not a citizen has to bow to those who are . 
   claim it to be their natural right everyone has a natural right to ** apply ** for citizenship in a certain country . 
  and , again and for the 50th time , it is for the ** state ** to decide whether they grant them citizenship . 
  no , it is n't . 
  racism is not a facette of fascism in its core , please , for gods sake get a grip on what fascism actually is . 
  this is ridiculous to the level of `` all socialism is communism '' . 
  and no , the scenario is not a fascist one . 
  for all intents and purposes this exact same scenario could be communist in nature . 
  uhm , do you even know what fascism means ? 
  or is it just another empty buzzword to you ? 
  since that entire part in my post has to do with racism , not fascism . 
  which is not the same . 
  no one is talking about direct democracy here . 
  direct democracy = !, 
  communities deciding who becomes a citizen and who does n't . 
  op just sees that as part of direct democracy , yet it is n't . 
  aside from that , no once did i say anything about fascism ... but hey , i 'm the one who is projecting , yeah right . 
   i see very little difference between this woman and a jihadist preacher . 
  til vegans = terrorists . 
  you got some issues man . 
  it is in the case of switzerland , but in other countries , where a lot of education , healthcare and social services is tied to citizenship , it is a right . 
  you must have the right to apply for citizenship and be either rejected or granted that right through a process , not because people like or dislike you . 
   it clearly works much better when you let professors and politicians decide everything . 
  the people are tired of `` experts '' !, 
  let the common man make the decisions !, 
  who needs them anyways with their `` expertise '' !, 
  so no hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans in western europe ? 
  and no southern europeans either . 
   instead , look at what we have now ... you 're right , we should 've really done something about those ee immigrants ... 
   constitutional rights only apply to citizens of that country , and the countries most elementary duty is to protect these citizens - even , or especially , if it comes at a cost for foreign nationals . 
  and in turn citizens have no say , whatsoever , on who becomes a citizen . 
  exactly for that reason , nutjobs going round saying `` they are leeching off the system ! '', 
  when in reality , the opposite holds true . 
   that 's the thing they are n't citizens so it 's natural that they do n't have the exact same rights . 
  ah alright , so they are just second-class humans . 
   yes for citizens if all 7 billion people had the right to vote on things that directly influenced me then democracy would n't be worth a damn . 
  yes ... 7 billion people fulfill the danish criteria of becoming citizens and live in denmark now . 
  they also all so desperately want to move to denmark specifically ... that 's why denmark is filled with 7 billion people now , because they * do n't * have the swiss system !, 
  take note world . 
  / s seriously dude , it would be nice if you were at least trying to have a grasp on reality for a discussion . 
  otherwise this turns into `` but what if illegal aliens arrive ?!, 
  can they become citizens ?!? '', 
   that 's up to the employer no , it is not . 
  if you can choose between potential employee a , who is a citizen who has full access to education , social services , healthcare etc. 
  that is a safe bet . 
  in comparison you have employee b who could just be deported , does not have full access to any of the mentioned above and is extremely risky . 
  you can live in whatever country you damn well please . 
  as long as you adhere to the laws and fulfill the requirements for citizenship , you could move to north korea and become a north korean citizen for all intents and purposes . 
  and no , the citizens should have no say in who gets to become a citizen and who does n't , that 's not the affair of a citizen but of the state . 
  no group of people should ever hold the power or have the right to refuse perfectly elligible people , merely because they dislike their skin colour , religion or general area they come from . 
  foreigners are already treated as second-class citizens in switzerland , no matter if they are citizens . 
  so no thanks , i prefer equal chances for everyone as long as you fulfill the criteria and behave . 
  * right * , i 'm the one not doing the thinking when it comes to your neighbours deciding whether you are a `` worthy '' human being or just foreigner scum . 
  citizenship does a lot more than merely granting you these rights . 
  aside from creating basically second-class citizens by not giving certain people the right to vote , which is an idea that we overcame quite some time ago ... in theory anyways . 
  employers will also look for citizens rather than those without citizenship . 
  without citizenship you also do not have access to embassies when travelling abroad , no access to a large part of the social service system etc. 
  having citizenship , aside from allowing people to properly identify as a citizen of that country , which is exactly what you want , grants a whole bag of things that are essential for anyone looking to live in a country for a longer time . 
  because then you grant the citizens the right to decree who gets humane treatment and who does n't . 
  which is exactly why the state handles such affairs . 
  humans are extremely biased , so it does not matter whether you `` like someone '' to determine if he is eligible for citizenship . 
  it would turn the state into one where most of an area is basically under tyranny of the ethnic and political majority , while there are small pockets of ethnic-exclusive communities . 
  which is a shitty situation for everyone . 
  i 'm certain you can look into his post history and easily identify just what he means . 
  as i said here , this will lead to exactly these situations where you have areas that all believe islam/christianity/buddhism or the god damn flying spaghetti monster are superior and anyone who disputes that is simply not granted citizenship . 
   this will totally not lead to areas which all share the exact same view , culture and skin colour or hey , same works for political reasons . 
  you 're not a hardcore fascist with a hateboner for everything `` not danish '' or not an extreme antifa member , known around for beating peopl who do n't agree with `` your '' view that marx and engels were superior ? 
  well tough shit !, 
  no citizenship for you then !, 
  only if you detach all social services and support from it , as well as all the essential rights that citizenship grants you . 
  yeah nothing could possibly go wrong when , in a larger county , your neighbours get to vote on who they like or dislike and in turn , who the state supports , protects grant rights . 
  this will totally not lead to areas which all share the exact same view , culture and skin colour , naaah . 
  sounds great . 
  `` resident peters is 70 years old and hates black people . 
  so he convinces the other 30 angry old people in his village to vote against granting a black student citizenship . 
  does n't matter that he was born and raised in denmark and only speaks english as another language . 
  better get back to africa you filthy ape ! '', 
  man , is n't that the dream for everyone !, 
   in timely manner it takes time and you got ta start somewhere . 
  sure and in 20 years there will be twice as many . 
  but hey , real gain ... 
  well , guess it 's fine then for russia to annex some nations !, 
  okay ? 
  nice ... i suppose ? 
  yeah !, 
  short-term solutions that the next generation can take care of - that 's the right way to think !, 
  the baby-boomers did it as well and i ca n't see any bad effects from th - ... wait ... shit . 
   in a country where a majority absolutely loathes a certain minority , democracy will only lead to the slaughter of that minority . 
  no , it does n't . 
  that 's tyranny of the majority , not democracy as a democracy has the duty to serve and protect every citizen equally .
