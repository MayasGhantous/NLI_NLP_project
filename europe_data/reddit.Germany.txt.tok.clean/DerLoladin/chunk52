  something that more and more people seem to forget . 
   both dictators and prime ministers require approval of the average to succeed . 
  no , they do n't . 
  a dictator only needs the approval of the important and mighty , most of all the military . 
  there are some solid videos out there explaining how you become a dictator and stay in power , no matter how much your country might suffer . 
   keeps the genocidal rabble rousers down a-huh . 
  because dictators have such a clean history without genocides ... oh , no wait ... 
  i 've had arguments with him before which always turns into a shitshow ( not unlike this thread ) . 
  so no , i wo n't waste my time and breath with someone who is a radical or paid for his/her opinion . 
  why would i ask `` the average '' ? 
  if i were to ask the `` average '' rural peasant in germany , half of them will tell me that `` democracy never did anything for us anyways . '', 
  yeah worked just peachy in algeria between 92-94 . 
  i mean , what 's a islamist insurgency and a few 100.000 dead , really . 
  libya started out pretty well ... until gaddafi seemed to go * kinda * insane . 
  also turns out , supporting terrorists in the bordering regions does not win you many favors . 
  south americans will also enjoy telling you all about how great military dictatorships are . 
  now , i understand that i might sound condescending and upset , but seriously ... military dictatorships do n't work long-term . 
  never have , never will . 
  especially in this day and age when new values and ideas are more easily accessable , especially for students and the brighter youth in those countries . 
   seize a couple of ports yeah !, 
  who cares about national borders , properties and international laws anyways !, 
  alsace-lorraine shall be part of the reich again too !, 
  long live the empire !, 
   about time to find a more accomodating candidate , maybe in the military , and aid their campaign . 
  because military dictatorships have worked * so god damn fucking well in the past * . 
  it 's like we do n't learn from our past mistakes . 
  that 's one way of saying that he is a russian shill that also claims that eastern ukraine belongs to russia . 
  who 's talking about my judgement ? 
  if you wish to know why the npd is not banned , you can look that up - it 's not because they are not anti constitution , i can tell you that much . 
  on the topic of the afd , i can take one look inside their party program and what they ` claim ' they will implement and do and show you plenty of unconstitutional things . 
   the last time i checked afd was not classified as anticonstitutional not * yet * it is n't . 
  but then again , the npd was n't banned either and it does n't get much more unconstitutional . 
   from a native speaker lul and no , i just could not make out what the hell he was trying to say . 
  do you see the sarcasm tag ? 
  hold on ... ** / s **, 
  as i said , that 's not what it 's about but rather your claim that croats would `` only '' serve drinks in those areas . 
  for the exact reasons that left-wing/right-wing extremists start false flag attacks to support their own agenda . 
  gon na see if i can find the article from die zeit that reported on the withdrawal . 
  ca n't wait for those exact people to sit at the border the next day and be like `` what do you mean i have to wait ?!, 
  this is ridiculous !, 
  and no , you can not check my vehicle ! '', 
  people only miss it once its gone . 
  both extremes are the completely wrong move , yet trying to claim that `` feeling less safe '' is only due to young refugees and asylum seekers is ridiculous . 
  there are many reasons , from the top of my head we have . 
  - young arab/african males - russias expansionism - rise of the far-right - terrorism in europe and that 's just what i could think of in a few seconds . 
  events have to be looked at , analysed and then measures have to be taken to prevent another occurrence of the same or similiar kind . 
  good thing there are n't hundreds of articles on the fake videos , pictures and statements made and created after that event . 
  and you 're an r/the _ donald poster , which still lets me come out on top, 
  riiiight and in germany every german runs around in lederhosen and is blond with blue eyes . 
  which is why saying `` there have been x number of crimes committed '' is a ridiculous statement , as you just ca n't prove it . 
  but hell , i 've heard people say that every `` schwarzkopf '' in germany is a rapist and should be killed , so what do i know really ... 
   welt is not better than bild . 
  uhm , what ? 
   link please on where i told people to `` ignore crimes '' . 
  oh god an r/the _ donald poster now hush , hush , back into the basement otherwise you wo n't get your good boy points and tendies . 
   `` the uk is muslim ! '', 
  it 's official - the uk is now an islamic country hahahahahaha , that fucking youtube link . 
  ah i dearly hope you 're taking the piss , otherwise that 's just sad . 
  link please on where i told people to `` ignore crimes '' . 
  oh i know you . 
  you 're that crazy russian shill . 
   if youre going out of your way to downplay that evening yet i 'm not . 
  perhaps you can explain something to me , as to why it 's so detrimental to have the event in cologne as the ** big ** argument that needs to be defended ? 
  hell , if we 're talking about cologne then there were n't even 600 reports of sexually related crime . 
  fuckin hell , it 's like whenever someone says that the numbers and facts are not `` thousands of rapes on good german women in cologne ! '', 
  the alt-right collectively goes `` reeeeee '' and looses their minds . 
  the event was horrifying and terrible , but what certain people have turned it into is just as disgusting for completely different reasons . 
  as i said , 2014 is the quoted time . 
  but hey , even if we go from before that :  the natural `` sex ratio at birth '' is 105 boys for every 100 girls , according to the world health organization so that still comes out at roughly 15 % , which is a lot , but not as massive as suggested . 
   you are obviously one of the lefty nutcases ah reddit , the only place where i can be called a right-wing fascist one day and a lefty nutcase the next day . 
  but hey , i can do a dismissive argument as well , you right wing skinhead !, 
  proper punctuation and a line to follow your arguements would also have been nice . 
  but since you saw it fit to insult me i 'm not even going to bother with you . 
  good bye . 
  who is ignoring the crimes ? 
  the police and ministry of jusitce sure as shit are n't and neither am i. 
  ah , if they knew that they are being painted on the flag of alt-rights and pseudo-fascists , i 'm sure they 'd all feel just peachy . 
  nice rant , not sure what kind of information you 're trying to convey though . 
   official statistics show that in 2014 , there were 108 boys for every 100 girls among sweden 's 16 and 17-year-olds . 
   but the country now has 123 boys for every 100 girls in this age group , according to valerie hudson of texas a&m university . 
  that is not even an increase of 10 % , far below what you claimed , 20-30 % . 
  especially considering that a large amount of the reports come from the week after . 
  it 's also been reported , multiple times , by the staatsanwaltschaft that a large amount of the filed reports have been withdrawn eventually . 
   yes , it is , because they 've never been cat called before , because they 've never experienced a young male forcefully blocking their way to hit on them , in public . 
  guess they lived a really nice and sheltered rural life then . 
  'cause there is no way that 's true . 
  but then again , this is the internet so you surely ** must ** be telling the truth ... you would n't lie , would you ?!, 
  d :  like i said , you 're a moron . 
  like i said , so are you . 
  and only muslims can commit crimes ? 
  damn , well , someone tell our crime statistics because they have to remove all those eastern europeans from there !, 
  thanks you too , especially since you can not offer any explanation as to why your average female member of society would notice more changes to their surrounding area than your average male . 
  if not personally , then through social contacts . 
  sure but * why * . 
  is it because they are actually less safe ? 
  extremely unlikely considering that crime statistics do not back that up . 
  or is it because how much of that stuff is reported now , be it fake or not , and how much people talk about it ? 
  perception and `` feeling smth '' is unfortunately rarely anchored in facts and reality . 
  i can have the perception of being save , yet the interior secret service can report over 10.000 stopped terrorist attacks of which i will have not witnessed any . 
  cool , why does that matter ?
