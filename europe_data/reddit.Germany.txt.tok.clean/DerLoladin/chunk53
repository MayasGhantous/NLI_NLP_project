   no crazy 1.000 + sexual assault happened in a single night actually true because a massive amount of them turned out to be false reports . 
  but hey , i 'm sure breitbart says different , 
  source please . 
  especially the tourist-heavy regions see a lot of that , particularly when you go out for partying or in crowded areas . 
  can actually back that up with personal experiences , but * somehow * i get the feeling that it does n't matter . 
  as i said , this does n't change anything as the percentage of victims who do n't report such crimes stays the same . 
  quite the opposite , due to the huge public dialogue on it , the percentage of victims who do n't report these crimes would actually go down , meaning the reported numbers would have to increase drastically . 
  only applicable if one does n't have any female family members of friends . 
  the op also specifically hinted at things that everyone would notice on the streets , so again , something gender neutral . 
  you apparently did n't even read the article . 
  aside from that , feeling `` less safe '' has nothing to do with actual safety but with perception . 
  do n't get me wrong , there is certainly a * risk * for women and it 's understandable , but that situation has not suddenly changed since 2015 . 
  it 's not like 2015 was the year when women suddenly decided to buy a can of pepperspray . 
   our horror stories were mostly spiked drinks grade stuff which is why women never go alone to clubs and such . 
  especially when you do n't know the club and know the clientel . 
  in berlin there are a whole bunch of clubs where you pretty much only go to if you ` intent ' to be groped . 
  ( q-dorf springs to mind ), 
  how does that play any role in the increase/decrease of safety in my area ? 
  i could be a fuckin sasquatch and would still take notice of increases of sexually related crime in the area , more groups of young men or less women on the streets . 
  which border ? 
  the one that lets in the southern and eastern euros ? 
  yeah , agreed . 
  without those everything would be better - hey how about we build a wall ? 
  because of ** wildly ** different social acceptances and views on different acts . 
   sexually assaulted you mean pick clean of any valuables ? 
  because that was the goal . 
  but hey , no problem . 
  i 'd like to invite you to visit berlin or munich during large events and you 'll find plenty of large groups attempting to rob/pickpocket people . 
  tell me more about how fl\u00fcchtlingsheime have changed the lifes of people so dramatically , while i take a walk past two asylantenheime and the asylantenmeldestelle which are both just 300 meters from my home . 
  god this area really has turned to shit , with all the crime and rapes and beheadings . 
  oh no wait , it has n't . 
  my former npd ( now afd ) voting neighbour claims otherwise , but then again he does n't go outside a whole lot . 
  `` my experience equals the experience of millions of women because i say so ! '', 
  - aight then m8 . 
  wut , you did not hear about `` ant\u00e4nzer '' in germany before 2016 ? 
  it 's really common in cologne , munich , berlin and all other larger cities . 
  also in clubs and discos . 
  hate to tell you but all the things you list are no more or less present than before . 
   women now encounter more groups of young men on their daily travels on the streets . 
  ah-huh ... right . 
  did the population of young males suddenly increase by like 20-30 % ? 
  man , i must 've missed that . 
   they get catcalled , whistled at more often . 
  source please , because otherwise that 's mere assumption . 
   they notice the increasing lack of women on the street . 
  uhm ... no . 
   the get a hand on the ass in the disco more than usual . 
  depends on the club and has always been the case . 
   it 's the little things that creep into your life yeah gosh , life in germany has changed ** so much ** since 2015 . 
  it 's like a completely different country . 
  mostly because of afd retards and `` concerned citizens '' but oh well . 
   trying to rob and rape ` ant\u00e4nzer ' and such are nothing new . 
  hell , there are smaller scale events like that in spain , croatia , greece or turkey . 
  it 's not a new thing , however , the big surprise was how organized these acts were . 
  okay ? 
  then there is no change to that since the reported numbers would increase or decrease with the unreported numbers . 
  except they are not . 
  crime has not increased , only representation in the public media . 
   that would prevent this which party would stop people from feeling `` less safe '' ? 
  a lot of it is also due to representation in the media . 
  terrorist attacks are also part of that . 
  find your own sources , there are plenty of sociology websites quoting exactly that . 
  aside from that , you might also wish to use common sense in that regard , instead of your feelings . 
  ( like you said ), 
  racism is no longer exclusive for races but includes groups of people in general . 
  that has been the case for a few decades now . 
  so you can be racist when saying `` all germans are disgusting . '', 
  or `` all americans are fat dumb fucks . '', 
  or `` spanish people are lazy and never do anything useful . '', 
  germans , americans and spanish are n't races , but it still is racism because they belong to a certain group . 
  it 's the same for religious groups , which is even more of a thin-line to walk on . 
  just because their religion is not a race , does not mean they do n't belong to a group of people . 
  same rules as for the nationalities above . 
  yes , which makes christians , muslims , buddhists , hindus , sikhs a `` race '' when referring to `` racism '' . 
  such as ? 
  with sources if you may . 
   the independent yes . 
  the rest ? 
   and who trusts the german police at this point ? 
  i do . 
  `` their consistent habit of lying '' - i think i might just throw up due to this stupidity . 
  racism = / = `` skin colour '', 
   voters increasingly want people like le pen and trump as leaders [ not really ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/gms.htm )  hate crimes against white people being colour washed please , keep your mental diarrhea in those regards to yourself . 
  then again , you are probably posting under every breitbart-fb article `` stop the white genocide ! '', 
   the silent majority is increasingly waking up oh god the sheeple and neckbeards are gon na turn this around !, 
   keep calling it `` fake news '' oh i will , [ because it is just that . 
   deaths and drownings of millions of people til the mediterranean sea is literally just bodies . 
  no , you get downvoted for many other reasons . 
  like claiming that people state that ukraine does * not * have a nazi and fascist problem . 
  ( like many eastern european nations ) especially in times of war such movements gain a lot of popularity and power , funny , considering that russia has been banging the `` fascists coming to eat your babies !, 
  '' - drum since the very start while also invading ukraine . 
   that alt-right bogeyman except it is very real . 
  fake-news and post-truth political grounds gallore . 
   it worked so well for brexit and trump it actually did , yes . 
  thanks for making my argument . 
   it 's not her fault french banks discriminate maybe she should do a bit less discriminating of her own , in that case the banks might be more willing to grand her loans . 
  you know , a little less alt/far-right populism and a bit more reality . 
  well thank god you 're not in charge of any diplomatic relations then . 
  hey what 's wrong with mussolini ? 
  or what was wrong with sadam ?
