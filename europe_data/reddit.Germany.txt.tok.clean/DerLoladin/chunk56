  i dunno about this , crimea looks pretty juicy this time of year ... 
  my point is that a movement , no matter how idiotic , that serves as an echo chamber for such matters ( and worse ) is very dangerous . 
  promoting an idiology that is not only extremely homophobic , xenophobic , authoritarian and anti-semite and in turn , giving it a huge movement across europe and the us . 
  show me ** proof ** of 100 + million deaths of people through a left-wing government in europe . 
  otherwise stop rambling . 
  not being obtuse , rather looking for facts instead of `` i 'd like this to be history . '', 
  so fucking edgy ( also a lie ), 
   anyone who says that just makes themselves look ridiculous hahahahahahahaha you have n't been keeping up with alt-right politics have you ? 
  it 's just as common as `` russia did nothing wrong in crimea ! '', 
  europe = / = asia, 
  well , now i 'm curious which regime in europe killed 100 + people ... 
  between `` we do n't know '' and `` maybe we can figure it out '' . 
  then please , explain to me the inner workings that led to such a decision . 
  because `` on a whim '' wo n't get you far when debating government affairs . 
   on a whim trying to stop greece and italy from going to shit is `` on a whim '' . 
  til . 
  please elaborate, 
   when they did veto ? 
  has a resolution like this been proposed ? 
  not yet , as libya is too unsafe . 
  however , considering that russia profits * immensly * from the refugee influx , there is no doubt that they will do everything possible to exploit this opportunity to its maximum . 
   are you in favor of setting up camps in libya so people dont have to die anymore ? 
  yes . 
  furthermore i 'm in favor of working together with the libyan government in deploying special forces to the libyan coast and conducting professional operations against the smugglers in coordination with precision strikes from the european navies against ( unmanned ) smuggler ships . 
  however , this would require a ) a functional libyan government , b ) the willingness of european nations to commit their troops to such a cause and c ) carries a large risk with it , as local population could view it as occupation . 
   the usa wants to deport me back to my home country belgium , belgium says no , i can stay in the us ? 
  no , because the us and belgium have signed treaties that allow them to detain you and send you home . 
  you will also pay a fine and likely be billed the cost of transfer . 
  such treaties do not exist with countries like libya , afghanistan etc. 
  if it were the same with the us and belgium , they also would not be able to send you home if belgium refused to take you back . 
  great idea !, 
  now if only russia could n't veto that ... ( and did ), 
  lul til i 'm a leftist , yesterday i was a right-winger aside from that , the eu mission within libyan waters is granted due to special rights through the un . 
  invading and occupying part of a sovereign nation is quite something else . 
  so , in your rambling i can read out that you * do * want to ignore sovereignty and international laws . 
  man , you must be a real fan of putin then . 
  no , that 's the problem . 
  spouting rhetoric without any kind of foundation is much worse though , since it 's only done to further ones agenda but will do * nothing * to help the issue at hand . 
   europe needs to step in and start a mission to take control of the lybian coast and stop this madness yay , 'cause fuck international law and sovereignity !, 
  nah you just are on the extreme end of the radical spectrum . 
  you got no plan . 
  that 's the issue . 
  screw human lifes and the rights of people !, 
  but hey great idea , if we can dump people like you out there the same way , since you seem to share a lot of their viewpoints . 
  just a small thing like human rights and international law . 
  you ca n't just take someone , drop him off in a country that he does n't belong to or that does not wish to take him . 
  only because afghanistan or somalia are shitholes , does n't mean they do n't get any rights . 
  jesus christ dude , you got some issues when it comes to muslims , apparently . 
   what do you reckon all the sattelite dishes are for ? 
  `` all the satellite dishes '' . 
  not sure what you 're on about , i live in an area heavily populated by muslims and there are no more satellite dishes , this is n't the 90 's . 
  ( well , small quantities . 
  my neighbourhood has like 4-5 )  watching chinese channels or something ? 
  no , perhaps sky though . 
  my neighbour has one - oh my lord ... he must be a secret salafist then !, 
  i never even knew !, 
  thank you so much , i 'll report him immediately and all other users of satellite dishes !, 
  oh you live in the same city as muslims !, 
  damn that is , of course , almost the same as sitting in their living room . 
  and no , there is very little point considering that what you state as a `` fact '' is simply not true . 
   most muslims stick together , speak arabic/turkish/morrocan watch arabic tv wow ... you do n't come into contact with a whole lot of muslims then . 
  let me ask you this : can you read ? 
  because nowhere does it say `` schoolgirls now have to officially pay attention to x or y. '', 
  actually , both articles go into great detail on the issue and signify the importance of not taking things out of context or pretending like you 're not allowed to wear certain things anymore . 
  well , ** now ** i 'm hyped for a source on that claim . 
  oh god no !, 
  please not the non-german face !, 
  only true germans may drink sterntaler and be drunk , alcoholic fuckwits . 
  yeeeaaah because that shit * totally * has n't been happening before the refugee crisis !, 
  nah-uh , before that there was milk and honey flowing in the rivers . 
  for fucks sake man . 
   at that age you have to make you own decisions . 
  good luck doing so without a roof over your head , food or assistance from your parents who 'd hate you for being gay . 
  aside from that , there are mentally handicapped people ( parents gain guardianship ) - oh i 've heard from my neighbour that electroshock therapy helps against that !, 
  eh , let 's try it . 
  great idea dude . 
  exactly , freedom of the individual . 
  the less means that others have to force people into doing something unnecessary or even extremely dangerous , the better it is . 
  but hey , advocate pro-electroshock therapy all you want you knob . 
   free practice of religion is not something we need to view as an important part of society . 
  holy . 
  shit . 
  the burqa is a statement of faith like any other and does not bring along an inherent security risk . 
  ( no , it just does n't . 
  a knife or a gun as a ` religious statement ' would fulfill that part ) that 's why it may or may not be blocked by the court . 
  you have no idea how society or even people work , do you, 
  in a war all it takes for civilian casualties is a single stray rocket , missile , rifle grenade , tank shell and so on . 
  mind you , i never said anything about the uaf aiming `` only '' at the rebels and their russian overlords - rather that they took up arms to maintain a sovereign state , threatened by those mentioned above . 
  you kept calling them `` the people '' which is quite simply not true . 
  clearly the tanks should just stop infront of a roadblock set up by russian sympathizers , instead of fulfilling their mission objective they were assigned . 
  this logic might work in your fantasy , but not in the real world . 
  it 's called ` war ' - in ` war ' people die . 
  it 's been around since ... like 40.000 - 50.000 years . 
  yeh i know , outragous new concept . 
  aside from that , 2014 marked the begin of the war in eastern ukraine . 
  a war initiated by eastern ukrainian rebels and russian `` vacationers '' . 
  but hey , look !, 
  dead people !, 
  my god what a surprise . 
  right , * the people * in this case being rebels and russian forces .
