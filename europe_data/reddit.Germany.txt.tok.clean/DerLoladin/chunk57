  oh look , a poor , oppressed russian minority !, 
  get the tanks , ivan !, 
  i do not subscribe to the believe that indoctrination , especially in young people , makes someone a good or bad person . 
  especially if it 's long-term . 
  also important to note is that ethnical superiority was not an outrageous concept during these times - judging the 30 's and 40 's by modern believes and standards is a flawed train of thought . 
   evidently he was not a good man oh you met him then ? 
  otherwise , how would you be able to make such a judgement ? 
  he was most certainly not an officer . 
  but that aside , this comment chain is not about this man in particular , but rather the resentment expressed by the previous poster in reply to a simple expression of happiness about such news . 
  the wehrmacht took part in some pretty gruesome shit , especially on the eastern front . 
  that front was hell itself and rape , executions and other crimes were widespread on all sides but especially the wehrmacht liked to execute entire villages for suspected partisan activities . 
  * riiiiight * 'cause every german was a devoted fascist just like all the spaniards , italians , vichy-french , eastern europeans and so on . 
  that is not how real life has ever , or will ever , work i 'm afraid . 
  every person deserves to be looked at on a case-by-case basis , it 's what we call ` justice ' in the west instead of painting everyone the same way just because it might be easier . 
  guess who else did that ... war is war , people die . 
  soldiers , civilians . 
  men , women , children . 
  should i go under every post of soviet or allied veterans , spitting poison and anger because of the people that my family lost due to allied bombs or russian pow camps ? 
  * hell no * . 
  no one gains from it nor is there any reason to , considering how long ago this was . 
   since when maths and natural sciences are `` liberal arts '' ? 
  since ... around about 50 years now . 
  [ math ] ( http://www.bu.edu/journalofeducation/files/2011/06/bujoe-183.3vandervelde1.pdf ) to quote a piece of that pdf  `` it is not enough to develop intellect , for intellect by itself is essentially amoral and capable of evil as well as of good . 
  we must develop the character which makes intellect constructive , and the personality which makes it effective . '' for natural sciences it is very similiar . 
  there is a reason many colleges and universities put `` liberal arts & science '' into the same sector , department or what have you . 
  academic areas that include the term `` liberal arts '' or fall under its definition : * arts ( fine arts , music , performing arts ) * languages * linguistics * literature * mathematics * natural science ( biology , chemistry , physics , astronomy , earth science ) * philosophy * psychology * religious studies * social science ( anthropology , economics , geography , political science , sociology , history ) but sure , those are all just `` pseudo-sciences '' . 
  some fucking people ... 
  donbass = / = ukraine i know , rough and all that . 
  especially considering that most of ukraine openly supported the protests . 
  but hey , i 'm certain they are also all just oppressed minorities that have to be brought `` heim ins reich '' . 
   which is why it 's disingenuous to only be comparing dedicated nato bases to russian national bases why ? 
  it ** is ** always about nato , not certain member states but rather nato as a whole . 
   it 's borderline propaganda to paint the russians as being much more militarized . 
  funny you should say that , considering there are more troops in kalinigrad and large cities in range of russian ballistic missiles that jets for the baltic air patrol . 
  you think nato should perhaps do the same and station a whole bunch of long-range ballistic missiles on the russian border ? 
  'cause it 's just such a show to live in the shadow of missiles . 
   when we where moving in on georgia and ukraine hah , yeah right ... that 's why georgia is in the nato-membership limbo since 8 years and ukraine decided that they do n't want to live under a putin-puppet any longer . 
  screw the idea of sovereign nations , ** all is rightful russian clay ** / s, 
  that only finished in 2016 and i 'm certain that this map is older then that . 
  because a single nation = / = nato, 
   but if gabriel runs , everything is open eh i do n't know about that , as i said , the spd has already lost a shitload of its voter-base but will likely keep their hardcore spd voters , who have never done anything else except voting for spd . 
  highly doubt that the cdu and spd will drop below their percentages , they have a very `` core '' base of voters that tends to vote for them regardless of events surrounding it . 
   for what people want but politicians do n't want to hear about . 
  yeah , yeah the made-up struggle of `` the poor '' vs. `` the corrupt elites '' . 
  populism is what a portion of `` the people '' * want * to hear as to reinforce their bias , opinions and supposed knowledge . 
  nah , cdu+spd could govern alone . 
  cdu+g reens + fdp would be another option . 
  that 's ... not at all what `` populism '' is . 
  take a look at the subway stations late at night , or at those working winter-service . 
  last time i checked you were n't allowed to become president without an academic education ... which he is n't likely to have . 
  turkey . 
  greece does not have the extreme nationalism at home or the economy to fight a war ( turkey does have the first in abundance and still has a stronger economy than greece ... for now ), 
  likely just pulling party-line and trying to get good-boy points with the left-spectrum . 
  which is a good damn disgrace and just shows that the socialists are only able to dig their hole even deeper . 
  ` knelled ' ? 
  try english next time and i might even understand you . 
  raf is innocent !, 
  true , they might just put you into a 1 $ - job right off the bat . 
  * ivanovic then yeah , i do n't care that a terrorist studied in hamburg and why would i ? 
  it quite literally has * nothing * to do with the topic . 
   continue to sacrifice on the altar of diversity and multiculturalism . 
  what is being sacrificed on that metaphorical altar ? 
  * wow !, 
  * well let me give you god damn medal then . 
  i remember some guy from berlin , called vladimir ivanovic , and yes , it was 90 's . 
  guess germany is overrun by russians now ... 
  dude , i know you 're a right-wing nutjob , but please think before you write . 
   in your own country there are quite a few muslims yes . 
  good job at deducting that there are muslims in germany . 
  a whopping 4 million is the general estimate , many of them being children of the guest-workers from the 60 's . 
  you have to apply first , which is the free part . 
  however , you are under certain requirements . 
  for example , you have to hand in at least 4-5 job applications to the jobcenter and get signatures that you were there , if you do n't , they cut your welfare . 
  if the jobcenter can not find you a job or no one will take you , you 'll be put to work with a so called `` 1 $ - job '' . 
  involving cleaning subway stations , parks and so on ... really miserable shit while only being payed a miniscule amount of money , if at all . 
  so no , it is not free . 
  you have to work for it . 
  there really has n't been a `` huge influx '' of muslims , it 's eastern europeans . 
  but sure , whatever you want to tell yourself . 
  first of all , hartz iv is not `` free '' . 
  second on the list , many countries have social welfare systems in place that do the exact same thing , often a lot less restricted than germany , so the argument `` they do n't move cause free money '' does not apply . 
  let me guess , a refugee in your book ? 
  hate to break it to you , but he has been a convert since the late 90 's . 
  man , guess those refugees have been here longer than i thought !, 
   at least put some things into perspective about immigration . 
  the head of the group is called `` sven lau '' soooo , ** ban all nordic immigration naow !, 
  before they convert us all to b\u00f6rk and k\u00f6ttbullar !, 
  `` free money '' ? 
  please elaborate , since those are german citizens . 
  are you daft ? 
  wait ... what do you mean with passport control and searches when i want to go on vacation ?! '', 
  but ... but ... poor russia ** never ** does anything agressive or threatening !, 
  is always evil , fascist , capitalist pigs of nato who are so mean to poor , innocent , pacifist russia :'( fucking / s, 
  what have you been smokin ' to reach that conclusion ? 
  fine , let 's show me a single party other than the cdu and spd with competent politicians and sensible policies that would get them elected by a majority . 
  there are plenty of alternatives , they are all just worse . 
  no thanks , i 'd rather not have the choice between sigmar gabriel or some other spd idiot or seehofer , von der leyen and de maizier\u00e9 . 
  nah , thanks , i 'm good and rather pick merkel . 
  name me a * single * politician from the cdu or spd that would have the experience , vision and integrity to become chancellor . 
  anyone , have your pick .
