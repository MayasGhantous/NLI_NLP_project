   as media cant even enter places like ksa , iran uhm , yes they can . 
  and sources for those claims , 'cause last time i checked child prostitution was an easy way to a death sentence in iran . 
   is a slang term in afghanistan good job , you generalised around about 1,6 billion people about a ( looked downupon ) practice from afghanistan of all places . 
  this will totally not [ end in a similiar way , as it usually does ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-women-iduskcn0w80ww ) ,, 
   while in islam its almost a norm . 
  weird , the muslims i know , some of them more religious and others less , all see child rape as one of the worst crimes imagenable . 
  guess they must all be child rapists anyways . 
  [ really now ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_church_sexual_abuse_cases ), 
  who is talking about marriages ? 
  you were specifically saying ** child rapists ** , a common practice with christian groups . 
  oh hey , that 's a new one . 
  instead of `` but the west is so evil ! '', 
  it 's just pure nonsense . 
  because [ bombing hospitals and other facilities ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/03/syrian-and-russian-forces-targeting-hospitals-as-a-strategy-of-war/ ) on purpose does not tend to convoy your `` good intentions '' very well . 
  found another link from [ amnesty international ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/03/syrian-and-russian-forces-targeting-hospitals-as-a-strategy-of-war/ ) absoloutly disgusting . 
  the numbers increased [ due to the migrant influx ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/kinderehen-1475-minderjaehrige-in-deutschland-sind-verheiratet-a-1111624.html ) which is to be expected , considering that it is perfectly legal in those countries . 
  since there is no law ( yet ) to nullify their marriages , they will keep their status . 
  [ seriously ? 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/story-of-how-a-kunduz-hospital-was-shelled-by-us-gunship-in-question/2015/10/10/1c8affe2-6ebc-11e5-b31c-d80d62b53e28_story.html ) do i also have to mention that the us actually disciplines their soldiers ? 
  and unlike russia , the us [ pays and apologises ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-afghanistan-attack-msf-payments-idukkcn0s40yk20151010 ) , instead of screaming `` western propaganda lies ! '', 
  the link is broken . 
  this is the perfect example of `` but look at what the us are doing !, 
  '' - whataboutism that pops up in every single thread that * dares * to critic russia . 
  and no , it is just as shitty . 
  ah that is unfortunate , thank you for the insight and information though !, 
  energy bills already have increased by quite a lot in recent years . 
  the whole `` energiewende '' was always half-hearted , the energy industry makes a nice buck off of it though . 
  do you sell your kiwis locally only or are they distributed over the eu ? 
  is it possible to aquire a crate ( or barrel ? ), 
  from your farm specifically ? 
  * right * they only semi-deliberately do it by using cluster ammunitions . 
  i mean , they did n't drop the bomb ` directly ' onto the hospital ... just a few hundred smaller ones that spread out . 
  and who will train the african militaries to keep their country safe ? 
  who will train them in counter-insurgent tactics and the guide on `` how not to get blown up by ieds '' ? 
  perhaps one of their ` stable ' neighbours will help them ... after commiting another genocide or two . 
  kiwis are my absolute favorite fruit - this post made me want kiwis . 
  ( send a crate my way , thx ) but seriously , which regions for kiwis should i avoid and which ones are better ? 
  also are pesticides and other `` modifications '' very common ? 
  funny , a huge amount of these stories are from backwards cave dwelling christian fundementalists born and raised in germany . 
  youtube does not block videos because they want to , they would only hurt themselves . 
  instead , gema notifies youtube about videos x , y , z and has them blocked through youtube . 
  oh , certainly . 
  at least everything that does not require steam . 
  if you were , however , trying to play wolfenstein 2012 then you can buy the uk-version , it will still only allow you to play the german version as long as you have a german ip . 
  ah right , because germany does not take the gamer and censors it themselves , it does not fit your definition . 
  they only ban the game from a market of over 80 million people . 
  much better . 
  are you retarded , because otherwise you might understand what `` censorship '' is and how it is happily handed out in germany . 
  because the government does not understand this new age of a thing called ` technology ' nor do they give a shit . 
  how should anyone guess ? 
  perhaps because they openly stated it on their website , that they have no dealings with gema . 
  gema even goes so far as to blocking or threatening those who are simply not with * them * . 
  `` we do n't know with whom they hold the license , but since we do n't know it must be us ! '', 
   you claimed germany would censor games , but it does n't . 
  [ really ? 
  gema does not have the rights to block artists who are not associated with them . 
  which they did . 
  which is also why they are a shady-as-fuck organization . 
  words , you understand their function ? 
  because if you do n't i 'd highly advise you to learn it . 
  as i wrote in the very first post that i made , this is about their musical content ( from various artists ) being blocked on youtube on their * own * channel . 
  which is nonsensical as they do not need a license from gema , as it free music . 
  considering that monstercat is releasing their music for free they do not claim any royalties . 
  royalty free music is not and should not be effected by gema . 
  you do n't need a broadcast license for your own music on youtube . 
  that would be even more ridiculous . 
  you need one for music clubs , discos or the radio - not youtube . 
  yeah , totally not because of a call for help from their former colonial state . 
  or because a terrorist-islamic state so close to algeria or morocco would cause huge instabilities - nu-uh , it 's all because of the oil and gold , and plunder and booty yarr !, 
  seriously , fuck gema . 
  they are so frustrating and ridiculous , hell , they blocked monstercat in germany even though they are ** their own yt channel ** . 
  ethnic cleansing is not hate speech ? 
  uhm ... okay, 
   `` we need homes , we need to be protected , not this , '' said another . 
  okay ? 
  then apply for asylum . 
  oh wait , you do n't want to or know you are n't eligible ? 
  well tough shit , back to afghanistan with you . 
  you can be dumb and racist . 
  they are not exclusive traits . 
  wanting `` less of a certain ethnicity , no matter if they are criminal or not or have dutch citizenship '' is the very definition of hate speech , when asked and made public in the way he did . 
  in the end the court will decide . 
  my am i glad that no one will arrest you for something like that on the continent . 
  must be truly a sad situation in the uk . 
  yeah right , wilders is a true fighter for the good , white european cause . 
  a true national hero . 
  for fucks sake ... 
  [ wat ] ( http://imgur.com/a/nuxvo ) the discussion had long moved to the * reasons * behind such attitudes , as shown in the videos . 
  i then took issue with a specific statement , that was represented as a fact by the poster . 
  if someone were to ask me something or wants to have a discussion about another topic , then i would 've had that conversation . 
  pretending `` oh it 's because you do n't want to talk about germany '' is just not a very intelligent conclusion , especially in context of my other explanations and posts about the topic . 
   for the my first post my point was that us military did n't killed that many civilians in war crimes similiar to wola massacre as germans did in one week of august in wars . 
  the us were and still are well aware of how many civilians their bombings and such will likely kill . 
  meaning it constitutes the definition of a war crime , if one would like to get nitpicky . 
  hell , if you want an easy example of a war crime that killed 200.000 people not in 1 week but 1 night read up on the [ air raids on tokyo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_tokyo#b-29_raids ) and yes , they knew they were intentionally targeting the workers and population . 
   but it was just a parallel by which i wanted to point out that german army was n't just `` normal army '' as some of the germans wants to believe and a false parallel . 
  that the wehrmacht was far from innocence is a well known fact , i 'd say . 
   i would say that american army killed less civilians throughout entire 20th century than germans in that one week in warsaw i 'm not even sure whether i should laugh or cry at this point . 
  for fucks sake man , am i speaking chinese ?
