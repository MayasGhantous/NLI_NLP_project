  why ? 
  that 's exactly what you proposed , more inter-eu cooperation so that the eu can carry their own weight . 
  which is achieved in the cooperation with germany . 
   the eurofigher [ ... ] outdated and expensive ah-huh . 
  sure . 
  tell me , how is the eurofighter outdated and after that i 'd like a price comparison between the f-35 and eurofighter . 
   the eurofighter is significantly more expensive . 
  no , it is n't . 
  the f-35a costs 98m $ as of the most recent contracts . 
  [ this article quotes it at even more expensive , running at 180m $ ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/eurofighter-sales.htm ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.krone.at/oesterreich/eurofighter-preis-hersteller-gibt-darabos-recht-alle-zahlten-57-mio-story-217998 ) the austrian defense minister quotes the price for a naked eurofighter at 57 million euros . 
  so no , the eurofighter is certainly not significantly more expensive . 
  elections = / = dictate of the masses . 
  ( thankfully ), 
   the quality of a system of government ah , good thing then that our system of government does not rely on the opinion of the electorate . 
  one of the few politicians that i hope stumbles , falls over and dies . 
  things i 'd consider to be moronic and which the `` electorate '' would have us do in no time . 
  - leave the eu - leave nato - no more russia sanctions - less taxes , more taxes on the wealthy , many more corporate taxes - no gay marriage or even legalisation back then in the first place - no immigration , no refugees , no asylum seekers i could go on like this for a while ... but sure , those are all ** great ** things . 
  man , how did no one have this idea before ? 
  yeah , that is his opinion . 
  and quite right so when you look at the `` opinions '' of the electorate . 
  that 's why direct democracy is an awful idea in such a large country . 
  way too many morons to decide idiotic things on the base of populism , naivety and `` good feelz !, 
  not what he is saying ... at all ... but alright . 
  thanks for your unbiased left-wing opinion . 
  now hush , hush , the ~ ~ sed ~ ~ linke does n't circlejerk itself , ya know . 
   only other minimally enticing proposition is probably something like spd+g reens or spd+f ar left for the left , and both have their problems ( or a triple coalition ) that 's currently in the talks but would , in my opinion , spell disaster . 
  the `` breilib\u00fc '' ( broad left coalition ) would have so insanely many facettes and in the end , no one would be happy . 
  the spd has turned into a more central-party and has no issues selling saudi arabia tanks , for example . 
  they also are n't huge fans of reform , making cannabis legal or introducing gay marriage . 
  they 're also opposing russia and their new-found expansionism while advocating a more active role for germany ( and the military ) in the world . 
  i 'm certain you can see where this is going . 
  the greens have ... well , i would n't call it a * plan * but certainly * ideas * for some social reforms , energy management and other topics . 
  they are ** very ** strong opponents of russias expansionism in ukraine while kinda-ish advocating for more presence in the world from germany , but then again , mentioning the military does n't go well in left-wing cirlces so they tend to only hint at that . 
  die linke on the other hand has very concrete plans for social reforms , state instiutional reforms , foreign policy reforms , military reforms ( reducing it to 0 % if they could ) and so on . 
  and since they are in support of putin , very anti-nato ( looking good there ~ ~ afd ~ ~ die linke ) and funny enough , pro-eu . 
  funny because being pro-eu would also entail supporting and defending the other eu members , yet they are against nato and using the german military for anything other than defending * germany * . 
  weird , huh ? 
  one might call them hypocrites . 
  you surely see how this would turn into a huge , steaming pile , right ? 
  there is a good reason as to why die linke has n't been in any coalition ... ever , i think . 
  one might also consider that they have some very radical wings , like the communist and anti-capitalist movement in them . 
  but enough breilib\u00fc ( whoever thought of that name should be hung up by his ballsack ) bashing . 
   on the right , seeing how a great coalition is a bad idea , could a cdu+g reens coalition succeed ? 
  well , it 's true , the spd has clearly said they wo n't enter into a new great coalition . 
  that leaves the cdu with a huge issue , especially in the face of the left coalition . 
  as you have already correctly assessed , the greens are the most likely coalition partner for them right now . 
  which is still a really cringe-worthy match , as cdu voters and green voters would rather tear one anothers throat out before working together . 
  but even so , the cdu still has a problem . 
  going off some [ polls ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/insa.htm ) it would suggest that even a black-green coalition would only reach about 40 % . 
  ** however ** you might have spotted another , small , party in the bunch . 
  one that no one cares about , does n't get anything done and functions like beneficial tumor to the cdu to get them the last few percent . 
  that 's right , the yellow fdp . 
  liberal party on the right-spectrum that has recently been resurrected and now stalks german politics like a rotting , smelling zombie . 
  a party that no one needs or wants , but alas they exist . 
  ( i 'm pretty sure they do n't even know why they exist anymore either ) so in that case it 'd be a black-green-yellow coalition between cdu+g reens + fdp . 
  on a side-note . 
  i should mention that [ other polls ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/insa.htm ) paint a slightly better picture for the cdu and greens , but still not enough . 
  the fight over the greens will be interesting , here is hoping they go with the cdu and not with the trainwreck that `` breilib\u00fc '' will be . 
  that is not power projection . 
  power projection is the ability to rapidly deploy * huge * forces and massive firepower against any arising threat . 
  each carrier strike group has the capabilities to turn a small country into ashes , hell , they carry ** nukes ** on those things . 
  helicopters are extremely limited in what they can achieve , as well as very vulnerable . 
  they are a support tool , not the main component of a strike force . 
  same goes for special forces , they are a surgical tool and not a jackhammer . 
  aside from that , even special forces require support and intel , the myth of just throwing a bunch of sf at something and they 'll be completely fine is just that , a myth . 
   he eu has more than enough coverage via land bases . 
  last time i checked the eu does not have * any * large bases outside of the eu . 
  nothing like ramstein airbase , pine gap or okinawa . 
  sure , you 've got france with a few military bases on some islands but no one cares about those . 
   ( like the spd , probably the only other ones with a chance ) heh , no . 
  that party is very busy dissolving itself and scaring away their voter base . 
  there is no way they win a majority in the election , not unless they find the resurrected jesus or the emperor of mankind in their midst and have him run for chancellor . 
   what about other parties ? 
  so cdu/csu is covered . 
  then you have the spd , a textbook example of a `` workers/people party turned neoliberal '' or `` how not to politics '' . 
  when your head of party is the economical minister who is busy * defending * ttip with whatever means , even insulting his voters over it as well as trying to have a certain supermarket chain establish a market dominance , you know something is not quite right . 
  and that shows , they are polling at some of the worst results since over 70 years . 
  next up , die gr\u00fcnen / the greens . 
  a party of birdwatchers and treehuggers that has no idea how-to foreign policy , security policy , economy or really * anything * that does n't have to do with ... well ... what greens do . 
  they are not exactly bad but have been condemned into the wasteland of `` opposition '' for now . 
  none of their politicians are minister/chancellor material and sometimes they are tipping dangerously into far-left waters . 
  so yeah , greens . 
  get your act together . 
  let 's get to the far-left and far-right partys , everyones favorite . 
  in the left corner of the ring , we have `` die linke '' a real heavyweight back in the ` good old ' [ sed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_unity_party_of_germany ) days of yore . 
  and it had to be , political prisoners and dissidents do n't torture , interrogate and execute themselves , you see ... well , unless you break their minds . 
  they are arguing that this is all * loooong * behind them , which would be great until you start looking at their ideas in regards to russia or their moronic plans for the economy . 
  social reforms and more money for our ~ ~ voters ~ ~ the jobless !, 
  how are we going to pay for that ? 
  well , socialism will , of course !, 
  oh and ~ ~ hitler ~ ~ russia did nothing wrong with crimea or in ukraine , of course . 
  in terms of politicians they only have two important ones , [ gregor gysi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gregor_gysi ) of whom i am a staunch supporter ( even though i 'll never vote far-left ) and that most people can agree on , is simply member of the wrong party . 
  if he were spd , he 'd have been chancellor long ago . 
  the other one is only important because she is one of the two good-looking women in german politics ( important ones ) - [ dr. sahra wagenknecht ] ( http://www.sahra-wagenknecht.de/images/sahra-wagenknecht3.png ) . 
  also very intelligent but sadly misled and incredibly naive , which makes her useless . 
  can you guess where the other ( important ) decent-looking women in politics is ? 
  that 's right !, 
  in the other , far-right , corner of our political ring : die alternative f\u00fcr deutschland aka afd . 
  an assortment of all kinds of people , from dissapointed protest-voters to dismayed cdu voters all the way to hardcore fascists , conspiracy theorists and literal nazis of old .
