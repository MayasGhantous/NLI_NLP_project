  ( yes , those with the whole `` gas the jews ! - idea . ), 
  a truly marvelous bunch , who are so insanely populist , they might as well be the xenophobic version of buzzfeed . 
  `` 10 things you wo n't believe merkel will make your child do !, 
  # 3 involves filthy homosexuals ! '', 
  and no , this is not a joke . 
  this is the party that is strictly against sexual education , especially if it includes homo - or transsexual views , claiming it would lead to minors being `` sexualized early '' and `` forced into being transsexuals or gays '' . 
  they also want to ban dildos , as they `` reduce the productivity of the german women ! '', 
  there is a huge list and one could go on all day , funny enough they have something in common with the far-left corner ... they also have a * love * for russia , who knew . 
  alike minds and all that . 
  ( $ $ $ ) their only important and prominent politician , is the one that r/the _ donald is currently busy jerking off to , now that melania trump has become boring , [ frauke petry ] ( http://fr-brsg-h.afd-bw.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/petrybreisgau.png ) . 
  when she is n't busy spouting some new bullshit she is avoiding interviews by quite literally telling her opposed discussion partner `` are you some kind of top-teacher or what ? '' . 
  so yeah , this is the german political spectrum summed up . 
  ( a bit cynical perhaps ), 
  two , to be precise . 
  the ancient charles de gaulle and the ( sorry italy :( ) tiny cavour . 
  other than that , only landing assault and helicopter carriers , which even then do n't come anywhere close to the same size or capacity as their us equivalents . 
  but i might as well clarify my previous post . 
  what i meant was n't helicopter carriers or charles de gaulle , but rather establishing the same power projection capacity , in this case via supercarriers , like the us does . 
   neither of the two did good in their role , but it 's been screwed up for a long time . 
  the difference is that it 's something they had the chance to * change * . 
  von der leyen probably more so than de maiziere , due to the fact that she is under the protection of merkel in the cdu . 
  but she did n't , instead her first reform was to lead with `` we need kindergardens for the barracks ! '', 
  and making the projections of all those , who doubted her due to her role as family minister , come true . 
  ( also the fact that none of her children serve and she said that , if it was her choice , they would never serve ... which is just a kick in the teeth . ), 
   many of the procurement failures we see today reach back decades . 
  careful , * some * yes . 
  ( a400m for example ) but not all . 
  the contracts for these equipment pieces were not made in the 80 's or 90 's but only when the project began to take shape . 
  that is * why * so many are so upset that the a400m is such a faulty aircraft , not a bad one , but far from what was promised and desperately needed . 
  and there is no compensation and no remedy in sight . 
  same story goes for the nh90 or puma , certainly , the government is partly responsible for the cost due to constant reduction in the actual vehicles requested , that does not change the issue with the government going `` oh well ... whatever '' . 
  when the nh90 turned out to be everything * but * the new helicopter everyone was hoping for . 
  no refunds , no refits , no complaints from the ministry of defense . 
  i 'm gon na write myself into a fit if i list all the issues that those god damn things make ...  it 's how we got the tiger helicopter back in the day , i believe . 
  well , the tiger is not a * bad * helicopter . 
  quite the contrary , the french have had great success with it and love it . 
  the issue is multi-facetted when it comes to the tiger . 
  first of all , politicians wanted an `` anti-tank '' helicopter . 
  a support-helicopter , not an attack helicopter . 
  this is also partly due to the believe that `` combat/attack helicopter '' would sound too harsh to the voters , who love to circlejerk and hate on the military already anyways . 
  funny enough , the supposed and official reason for not getting a cannon was the argument , that it had too much recoil . 
  which is complete bullshit , as any french tiger pilot will tell you . 
  then rheinmetall offered to refit the helicopters with * recoilless * - cannons that they developed - again , not bought . 
  so yeah , the tiger is a good helicopter that turned awful in the hands of german politicians and traditionalists in the military . 
  what started as not such a bad idea ( because an anti-tank helicopter is `` not bad '' to have ) turned sour when germany went to show once again , just how badly we adapt to ... anything . 
  what ? 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  and who is `` our '' ? 
  the eu also is n't a country . 
   i meant concerning any issues . 
  aside from ideological , economical and strategical ties , the us and europe are completely seperate and even competing with one another on many fronts . 
  for example , cars and manufacture of them . 
  the us lost * big time * in that race . 
  same goes for technology and research , as europe is pulling further and further ahead . 
  internal issues have to be taken care of internally and without outside help ... until someone asks for it . 
  but at that point , said government is mostly throwing everything down and leaving the room shouting `` i have no idea what i 'm doing anymore ! '', 
  so not exactly the first option people would go for . 
  sure and no one here wants americans to mess with our civil issues . 
  those are ** ours ** to deal with - i 'd go so far that even a right-wing pis follower would back me in that . 
   economic and civil issues . 
  those are not issues that the eu can or even wants to help with . 
  not even to mention that no one in the us would want our help in that . 
  hell , we have a shitload of civil issues in the eu that we have no cleared up , might as well clean up at home first before we start handing out arrogant phamplets in the neighbourhood . 
  you are entitled to your opinion . 
  i have explained , in full detail , my reasoning as to why merkel 's decision in regards to the refugee crisis was not the make-or-break point for the brexit . 
  and other than `` it is so because i say so . '', 
  there has n't been much else from you . 
  so please , stop bothering me with your assumptions that i 'm deflecting something merely because i do not agree with your view on things . 
   the rest is just your deflection . 
  [ ... ] without the refugee crisis leave would 've lost 45/55 . 
  [ uhm , no . 
  but alright . 
   there is a core constituency who does n't like eastern european immigrants but they are not half the population so half the population hates muslims instead ? 
  i doubt it . 
  as i said before , it 's not about who dislikes who or which group they preferrably like to hate on , but a systematically drummed up anti-eu sentiment through the `` news '' , media and politicians . 
  people who would not have voted at all had to perceive the eu as an active threat to their livelihoods and `` freedoms '' . 
  whether the picture shows arabs or eastern europeans makes little difference in that regard , they are perceived as a `` threat stemming from the eu '' . 
  this sentiment , as i also said before , has been a long time coming . 
  britain has been painted as this utopia that every immigrant * ever * wants to move to . 
  although to be completely honest , the refugees or immigrants are the least of the reasons why people voted pro-brexit . 
  it seems a great many were actually convinced of the fact that the eu was restricting britain and leeching off of its live essence , which is completely bonkers but when you present something as a fact since the 90 's , enough people eventually begin to believe it . 
  so no , i am not in denial nor am i certain that the refugee crisis ( which had nothing to do with merkel 's actions mind you . 
  but then again , some people apparently like to believe she all spawned them herself ) had * some * impact on the final referendum . 
  but to say that it was the cause or the * great decider * is short-sighted and ignored facts . 
  rather simple . 
  there are 23 languages in europe , all spoken by their respective countries . 
  english gets some people along but you 'll have a difficult time finding people with good english skills in eastern and southern europe . 
  ( also , france and rural germany ) now , all these languages are attached to nations . 
  nations who price their military like their favorite toy and just do n't want to let go of it even a tiny bit . 
  now also consider than no one can * force * these 23 countries to do anything with their toy . 
  they all have to decide for themselves . 
  some would immediately say `` yeah !, 
  a power for peace and stability - our eu military ! '', 
  and others will simply respond with `` buuh , the eu smells of refugees and ~ ~ democracy ~ ~ left-wingers . 
  gib borders ! '', 
  now let 's presume they even all agreed to grab their toys and play with the children across the little lake . 
  the parents understand each other , but the children building sand castles and playing with sticks have no clue what the other says . 
  one of the toys lost a wheel . 
  so the child asks all the other children and parents if they have a replacement part for it , they all shake their heads because everyone is using a different toy from a different manufacturer . 
  in the end they all decide that this is pointless , someone got a blue eye and everyone goes home .
