   images like that breaking point poster farage did ( which would n't have been possible if things had been managed differently ) is what pushed it over the edge . 
  he would have replaced the same poster with migrants from eastern europe . 
  it makes no difference for the british people and the tabloids who were the biggest drivers behind the anti-eu campaign . 
   i 'm saying that the choice should not have existed because of the situation that created the division in the first place . 
  even before the refugee crisis there was * a lot * of division and disagreements . 
  that event just put fuel into the fire . 
   but she is doing a lot of things right as i said , there is n't a whole lot you can actually do wrong at this point . 
  she continues on the same path that her predecessors took , not changing anything drastic and hoping that she can make it through her term as defense minister . 
   the navy guys i know do n't think that the k130 is that bad . 
  they are not * bad * , they are just outdated and unnecessary . 
  they are not bought because they are needed , but because two very influental members , johannes kahrs ( spd ) and eckhardt rehberg ( cdu ) , said so and ` oh wonder ' the ships just happen to be build in the districts they are responsible for . 
  was a need for these ships mentioned in the last `` r\u00fcstungsbericht '' ? 
  nope . 
  does such a hasty decision , with such a large investment , paint an interesting picture on von der leyen and her politics ? 
  you be the judge of that . 
  these are 1,5 * billion * euros that could have been invested into `` stube 2000 '' or buying some new radios ... or ** perhaps ** getting rid of that god-damn koppelsystem . 
  certainly , to a degree . 
  however , the eu is in no position to guarantee safety to anyone . 
  it can not even guarantee it for its own members . 
   sorry , justified or not ( i think somewhat ) her actions have destabilised europe and directly caused brexit . 
  uhm ... no , they did not . 
  a brexit has long , ** long ** been coming and the referendum was promised long before * her actions * ever happened . 
   i would rather a strong leader in france to take charge hah , good luck with that . 
  nothing against france and the french people but i want a single frenchmen to tell me that their country is in any position right now to take the wheel . 
  not gon na happen . 
   east germany should 've been allowed to remain and just transition into a non-communist state complete crap , no one ever wanted the divide nor did it ever achieve anything except creating wet dreams for all the germany-haters post war and when germany rose to power and influence again . 
   just as austria today is a german state with a sovereign government . 
  you better not say it that way around any austrians ... 
  i 'd read up on some history if i were you . 
  let 's see . 
  von der leyen : the women has the experience in many fields , but is she competent ? 
  kinda-not-really-ish . 
  she is also not particularly well liked by the people , as she has been the up and coming `` poster child '' of the cdu who make no secret about it , that she is her new to-be chancellor . 
  other than that she * was * on an alright track with the military as defense minister . 
  however , there are very few drastic measures and she has the same symptom of `` i need a project that people associate with me ! '', 
  as her predecessors . 
  namingly the fabricated g36 affair , the new anti-air system which will be ridiculously expensive and now 5 new corvettes which are out-of-date , unreliable and overpriced . 
  did i mention that she has * no * presence whatsoever and is more of a `` mouse '' than a lion ? 
  now , de maiziere . 
  a trainwreck of a politician . 
  if he is n't too incompetent for a job he is overburdened by what his job entails . 
  being put into the position of defense minister , he managed to spend billions on quite literally * nothing * while also having his underlings sign contracts for new equipment , ranging into the billions , printed out from standard forms on the internet without lawyers present . 
  yeah , you can imagine how that went and still goes ... as minister of the interior he seemed to be doing much better , but as u/nookn has already said , the man is n't particularly good with any words and knowing him as defense minister , i highly doubt that the recent successes of the police can be attributed to him . 
  it is also under his supervision that our police force is rotting away . 
  predictions are that almost 50 % of the current police force will retire in 3-4 years with ** no ** replacements . 
  that is in a time , when the police is already understaffed and underfunded in a large part of the country . 
  going to be a really fun time when the police lacks 75 % of the officers it would need to still function at 100 % . 
  so yeah , de maiziere or von der leyen as chancellor ? 
  no thanks , before that happens i 'm going to vote green ... or some other shit . 
   she is managing the army better than her two predecessors . 
  an excerpt from someone serving . 
  * fuck no * . 
  there is n't a whole lot you can do wrong when you hit rock bottom but the contract for the new five corvettes just goes to show that von der leyen is no better or worse than her predecessors . 
  well , suppose it comes down to what one would want to define as `` an equal '' . 
  in terms of research , progress and development ? 
  definitely , europe is already ahead in that regard anyways . 
  in terms of military it 's going to be more difficult , as they have allways been every countries right-wings favorite plaything . 
  so a `` unified '' eu military might eventually be able to stand just as tall as the us military , but it will take a lot of time and investment to be `` true equals '' in that regard . 
  so ... i suppose we both agree . 
   as we saw with the token support in afghanistan hah , okay then . 
  sure . 
   constant protectionist attacks on us business yeah ... `` constant '' . 
   the us stupidly gets dragged in libya no one * dragged * the us into libya . 
  they entered that conflict willingly and on their own accord . 
   not defending some small country on the other side of the world . 
  perhaps not . 
  but it * becomes * their concern once their largest trading partner is being threatened , namingly the eu . 
   we 'd have to spend way more than the 2 percent of gdp for some time to catch up with the us . 
  who says anything about `` catching up '' ? 
  as of now , europe has no need for aircraft carrier or hundreds upon hundreds of bases in other countries . 
  the us military has so many money sinks , that europe does not need to worry about for now . 
  that 's a non-existent argument . 
  the us have an interest in nato as it guarantees the safety of their biggest trading partner , namingly the eu . 
  it also is a great help in cooperation and part of the western world . 
  no one should leave nato until there is an adequate replacement , everything else is short-sighted and populist crap . 
   it affects you in a positive way , whether you 'd like it or not . 
  again , i 'd love an example as to `` how '' exactly it benefits me . 
   how about electing somebody who will not do that ? 
  ah , yeah thanks but i will pass on electing our equivalent of a hardcore left-wing government that still believes in post-communism bullshit . 
   the average german does not benefit from the german economy ? 
  now you are talking about the german economy as a whole ... a pretty big one . 
  ranging in the trillions , yearly . 
  tell me again how an arms deal over a few million effects me personally , because i 'd love to know where i can pick up that new sports car after every arms deal !, 
   what do people usually do in democracy when they want something done ? 
  most likely demonstrate and hand in signed petitions . 
  been there done all that . 
  aside from your second paragraph not making any sense , i 'm afraid to dissapoint you . 
  the average german ai n't getting shit from arms deals with the sauds . 
  but hey , since you seem so knowledgeable , tell us what to do , o wise one !, 
  nah , just for a [ majority ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/dimap.htm ) . 
  sorry fascists . 
  read the post of op again :  i do n't see ** you ** having issues with saudi arabia . 
  yeah as i said , what ` ya want me to do about it ? 
  and no , sorry , but germany is not suicidal enough to go full trump and elect the afd . 
  ah right , yes . 
  let me just walk onto the balcony and shit out some sanctions against saudi arabia . 
   i do n't see you having issues with saudi arabia . 
  `` you '' as in whom ? 
  there are a shit-ton of people with massive issues when it comes to saudi arabia and that goes for the entire western world . 
  that 's actually ... really damn awesome .
