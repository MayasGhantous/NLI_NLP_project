  not sure i 'd make him president but got ta give him props for his skills . 
   him being `` pro russian '' is lame propaganda . 
  ah , there it is again . 
  the magical buzzword of alt-right dimwits and putinbots , `` propaganda '' . 
  are you aware of what an example , in this case sweden due to the op i was responding to being swedish , is ? 
   un countries are n't required to take refugees yes , they are . 
  read for fucks sake . 
  it 's a useful skill . 
   scotland does n't have to take refugees . 
  sure they do , should they arrive at scottish borders without passing through any other ** safe ** countries . 
  for fucks sake . 
  if a single boat would arrive at scotlands shores with refugees from syria , they would have to take them . 
  so no , i 'm not responsible for your wacky interpretations . 
  the udhr is not an `` option '' . 
  you are part of the un = part of the udhr . 
   now when you actually read the treaty it does n't require countries to take people crossing from a safe countries people can stay in either . 
  never claimed that . 
  nope , i 'm claiming all [ these ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/protection/basic/3b73b0d63/states-parties-1951-convention-its-1967-protocol.html ) have signed something that makes them obligated to take them . 
  but if we break it down , the un has 193 member states , 148 of those have signed both refugee charters from 1951 and 1967 respectively , including most if not all western states . 
  thus , if your country is associated with the western world , it is extremely likely it signed that charter . 
  but hey , not enough ? 
  alright then . 
  so every participant in the un has to accept the general declaration of human rights . 
  ( yes , you too . ), 
  which includes article 14 . 
  so unless you want to say `` hey , we 'd like to be on the same level as saudi arabia ! '', 
  then being part of the un means just that . 
  the amsterdam treaty for the eu also specifies that again but it is n't really needed , as asylum and refugee laws are part of the [ treaty on the functioning of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union ) . 
   spend a moment thinking where that level of poor knowledge and ignorance comes from good advice !, 
  you should heed it . 
   let 's say sweden ( just an example ), 
  as an apache combat helicopter , this is r/nocontext . 
   it 's incredibly common except not really . 
  there are cases but it 's not like every military base has some kinda swastika-inscribed flag hanging over the main-gate or in the commanders office ... 
  if wagenknecht is a candidate for chancellor then so is christian lindner ...  . , 
  what ... please do n't tell me you 're actually serious , please . 
  freedom of speech and the concept of it exists a lot longer than the us constitution and is ** not ** the brainchild of the founding fathers . 
  man , this explains a lot ... 
  `` should be '' does not apply to the definition of human rights . 
  germany very much possesses free speech , just apparently not the definition of it that you like . 
  incitement is ** not ** free speech , even though certain right-wing elements would like it to be different . 
  again , read the definition of free speech and the matters covered under it . 
  because the law that bans these matters is extremely specific about the gestures and symbology included and can not be extended to other symbols . 
  this is , obviously , done for historical reasons but also as to not turn these symbols and gestures into a trivial matter . 
  furthermore , human rights are deeply ingrained and protected by the constitution . 
  that includes freedom of speech . 
  ( no , the hitler salute does not fall under that . 
  if you do n't believe that then i recommend reading the definition of freedom of speech . ), 
  no , it does n't . 
  ah yes , like poland ... oh no , wait ... 
  yes . 
  going so far as to having your voting rights revoked . 
  iran has nothing to gain from such actions in europe nor are they interested in it . 
  european - iranian relations have usually been business related , not based on ideology . 
  this is not the case for ksa . 
  not my issue whether people think it 's offensive or not . 
  fact of the matter is that it 's a right-wing militia with the goal to , and let me quote the defense ministry here , `` strengthen poland 's patriotic and christian foundations '' . 
  but i 'm sure the crowd attracted to this sorta volunteer work will be very mixed and diverse ... / s, 
  solid idea . 
  whether these border restrictions would exist in wartime is another question , however , it 's always good to be on the safe side . 
  well , * kind of * a big deal considering that poland is facing sanctions from the eu for these matters . 
   low level defense to which regular army is ill prepared . 
  for low-key incursions , that 's the job of the police . 
  if it gets bigger , the military should have no trouble taking over . 
  there is no need for a `` territorial defense unit '' , which is basically just a pis-friendly militia . 
  which wo n't stop more smugglers on the shore , more arrivals from the south , more routes in other mediterranean countries etc. 
  the shore and smuggling is a symptom of a much larger sickness that will simply spread to another nation and resume there . 
  to ` fix it ' , like was claimed , you need ground troops and a ground presence . 
  that is the de-facto suggestion by saying `` we can end this '' . 
  no one has ever questioned that . 
  question though should be , is he willing to have italian soldiers die en masse in lybia to forcefully `` stabilize '' the country ? 
  did n't think so ... 
  itt people who have n't read the ( tiny ) article and have no understand of the definition of `` immigrationshintergrund '' in germany . 
  wtf has that to do with the gym ... 
  unless you are * that * confident in your ancestral lineage going back a few thousand years , yeah . 
  sure man , * annoying * . 
  funny , considering it 's usually the one eastern european in my gym that 's annoying as hell , while all the `` brown nuisances '' are minding their own business . 
  usually everyone does minds their own shit and the annoying ones are teenagers in groups of 5 + . 
  italians are usually tanned or at least not completely white and with black or brown hair . 
  thus , you would be banned from `` a gym like that '' . 
  you god damn terrorist . 
  news spread quickly , even in the ussr . 
  you can try and keep it under wraps but you 're fighting a war at the same time so ... good luck . 
  did n't work when the ussr was in the cold war and neither would it have worked then . 
  what a retarded metaphor . 
  `` migrationshintergrund '' can mean both parents were not born as german citizens or only one parent was n't . 
  aside from that , i 'll stick with german citizenship = german . 
  thanks . 
  funny , considering that you 'd be banned from `` a gym like that '' . 
   afd : collapsing more due to its own internal squabbles than germans becoming more tolerant bullshit . 
  the afd is collapsing because no one takes them serious anymore and instead of displaying themselves as `` not complete nazis '' they went full-on extreme over the past few months , making themselves completely and utterly unelectable . 
  it 's not about germans being more or less tolerant , but rather that their whole message `` in 2 years the world is going to end because of brown people ! '', 
  has been complete garbage . 
  all true , however , the narrative with his son is not simply a ` semi positive spin ' but something he simply could not do and would be very unlike the other examples . 
  tactical strategical mistakes or ignorance are one thing , but in the ussr to openly say `` this guy is more important than hundreds of thousands of soviet soldiers '' ? 
  no way . 
  well , his explanation for that is reasonable though . 
  why would his son , an officer in the military , suddenly get special treatment and a pow deal when those were n't done for the regular soldiers either ? 
  it would have been devastating for morale . 
  whataboutism .
