  imo that 's just not a very fitting group . 
  some are simply uninformed and go off the information they remember hearing about in school , reading some ( unhistorical ) book or by playing war thunder or whatever . 
  others are , as i said , pretty much borderline-nazis going out of their way to downplay or deny the crimes of the nazi regime . 
  and yes , that includes wehrmacht , ss and whatever else . 
  [ uhm ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a5n9c/world_war_ii_justified_by_former_german_soldiers/d9dxccb/ )  no we are talking about wermacht crimes and its denial by wermacht veterans . 
  so first of all , no one is talking about the warsaw upspring , the * other * crimes of the wehrmacht , or anything else except your specific [ statement ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a5n9c/world_war_ii_justified_by_former_german_soldiers/d9dxccb/ ) . 
  not mass murders , not mass killing , not atrocities , not genocides . 
  simple . 
  numbers . 
  also , the sinchon massacre was committed with the help of us troops . 
  let me know if you want me to spell it out for you again , especially the part that focuses on your statement . 
  all these comments by myself are in response to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a5n9c/world_war_ii_justified_by_former_german_soldiers/d9dxccb/ ) statement . 
  this has nothing to do with the holocaust or any of the other mentioned parties . 
  do n't know about the medic case , but oskar gr\u00f6ning , the account you were referring to , * chose * to be in auschwitz and actively participated in the holocaust . 
  he said so himself , thus sentencing him to 4 years in prison ( which he is unlikely to ever see due to his health ) is only fair . 
  he knew about it , partook in it and actively helped . 
  being aware and apologising for ones actions does not remedy the amounts of suffering he helped to cause . 
  ... ... my patience has its limits . 
  so , in case you suffer from a disease that limits your memory in some way , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a5n9c/world_war_ii_justified_by_former_german_soldiers/d9dybtz/ ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a5n9c/world_war_ii_justified_by_former_german_soldiers/d9dz9u1/ ) are my two previous posts . 
  not sure why you just keep on ignoring the information i 'm providing you with . 
  anyways , have a nice day and even if you ignore everything i said in favor of your own , flawed , worldview then i hope that others reading it might have learned something . 
  simple , because we are not comparing the wehrmacht to the us military now , are we ? 
  last time i checked they were not on the same level ... oh and the us was part of a small organisation called the ` un ' and signatories of the universal declaration of human rights , which means they were obligated to intervene . 
  we can also further explore the concept of `` guilt by association '' if you want to . 
  you want me to quote you again ? 
  you said that the us military is responsible for less dead civilians in the whole 20th century , than the wehrmacht only in that one week . 
  i provided you plenty of sources and proof that this is not the case . 
  and i 'm not up for cherry-picking after the fact . 
  that 's ... not at all what i said . 
  read again . 
   concentration camp guards and other ss members who can be directly and evidently linked to their crimes . 
  so unless the medic gave the direct order or the accountant participated directly , they are not even on the list . 
  completely blanked on the us in ww2 in [ my ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a5n9c/world_war_ii_justified_by_former_german_soldiers/d9dybtz/ ) comment . 
  damn , that would 've made it even easier ... 
  indiscriminate bombings because `` everyone is a commie anyways '' or `` who gives a shit about them '' is just that . 
  but alright , since you want such * very specific * examples of us supported/condoned actions , i 'll give you that . 
  here we have the [ sinchon massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinchon_massacre ) , `` but that 's only a lousy 30.000-35 .000 dead ! '', 
  you might say . 
  okay then , here is the [ bodo league massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bodo_league_massacre ) . 
  hey , around about 100.000-200 .000 dead , including children and all those `` filthy communists '' . 
  slaughtered by the south korean forces ( supported by the us ) while the us sit next to them and did ... nothing . 
   in one case a us officer is known to have sanctioned the killing of political prisoners so that they would not fall into enemy hands . 
  oh , well , i mean you ca n't blame them for killing the occassional communist themselves here and there eh . 
  those rascals ! ... 
   the massacre was also reported to both washington and gen. douglas macarthur , who described it as an `` internal matter '' . 
  because who gives a shit about civilians !, 
  are you satisfied yet or should i move on to the vietnam war * or * guatemala ? 
  they usually go after concentration camp guards and other ss members who can be directly and evidently linked to their crimes . 
  do n't see anything wrong with locking that scum away . 
  whether they pay for their crimes when they are 40 or 90 does n't matter . 
  killing civilians is killing civilians . 
  how it is done in the end does not . 
  matter . 
  the people , families , children , elderly are dead . 
  whether they are killed by a shot from a rifle or by a cluster-bomb that was dropped on them does n't fucking matter . 
  oh certainly , i was more aiming to say that there will always be those who romanticise certain factors or groups in history . 
   i would say that american army killed less civilians throughout entire 20th century than germans in that one week in warsaw holy . 
  aight , let 's get counting . 
  you raise me 50.000 dead in the wola massacre . 
  guenter lewy , a * supporter * of the us actions in vietnam suggests 220,000 dead civilians as part of the us `` body count '' . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnam_war_casualties#civilian_deaths_in_the_vietnam_war ) - as also talked about in his book `` america in vietnam '' . 
  the estimates for north vietnamese civilians killed * only * through bombs is already around 50.000 - 60.000 thousand , according to this [ source ] ( http://faculty.washington.edu/charles/new%20pubs/a77.pdf ) . 
  but wait !, 
  there is more !, 
  what did the united states use again in vietnam ? 
  that 's right , a chemical called ` agent orange ' . 
  spraying a whopping 76 ** million ** liters of it over a 6 year period . 
   vietnam 's government claimed that 400,000 people were killed or maimed as a result of after effects , and that 500,000 children were born with birth defects . 
  now , one might put some doubts on the vietnamese governments perspective and that is quite alright . 
  let 's dial those numbers down a bit to perhaps 300.000 killed and * only * 400.000 born with birth defects . 
  further reading can be done both [ here ] ( http://www.agentorangerecord.com/impact_on_vietnam/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/agent-orange ) but wait , was n't there * another * war that the us happily participated in during that time period ? 
  why yes , there was . 
  in laos the us dropped just about 2 ** million ** tons of explosives . 
  most of which have not been found and are cluster ammunitions , maiming and killing people to this day and every year . 
  civilian casualties are around about 50.000 civilians since 1964 , lots of them children . 
  source [ 1 ] ( http://legaciesofwar.org/resources/cluster-bomb-fact-sheet/ ) and source [ 2 ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/05/asia/united-states-laos-secret-war/ ) ) and that is only vietnam and laos . 
  should i also cover the gulf wars and the korean war ? 
  or perhaps i should also add the numbers from the south vietnamese government or the south korean government , who were openly and widely supported by the us . 
  or maybe take a look at south america ... ? 
  unfortunately that is extremely common . 
  go to the us and ask people about the atrocities that us troops committed in vietnam or korea , hell , even more recent in iraq if you want to . 
  i promise you many will become immediately extremely defensive or even aggressive , same thing in russia . 
  they view it as you attacking their ` tribe ' or social group , that they envision themselves part of . 
  whether this makes any logical sense is irrelevant , as they view it as part of their social identity . 
  then again , going to a wehrmachtsausstellung or similiar is bound to attract all the apologists and ` hitler did nothing wrong ' - fuckwits in a large radius . 
  a better eu , [ with force if needed !, 
  do n't think anyone , apart from borderline-nazis , is saying that . 
  however , since the wehrmacht was so large it 's almost impossible to identify those who took part in mass murder and atrocities . 
  saying `` every soldier was guilty of it ! '', 
  is just as stupid as saying `` every soldier was innocent ! '', 
  do n't worry , in that case russia will only send 20 % of its military to end the evil fascist opression . 
  how are they going to do that when they become part of germany , as he envisions ? 
  there is also a real , genuine threat in iraq , afghanistan , mali , a large-part of sub-sahara africa and so on . 
  luckily they do n't all count as legitimate refugees . 
   meaning that neither of those migrants are usually genuine refugees when they come into eu . 
  considering that this is mostly semantics , it 's moot . 
  otherwise you 'd have the exact situation that happened last year , with greece and italy almost bursting and especially greece sitting on the brink of total collapse . 
  since there are now deals for that in place , to re-distribute the refugees from those countries , that means they keep their refugee status as they are simply relocated . 
  also , first `` safe '' country is relative . 
  parts of turkey are not considered `` safe '' for example , which makes it a legal dilemma .
