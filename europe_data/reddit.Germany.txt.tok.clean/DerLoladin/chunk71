  you 're either `` normal '' or not healthy . 
  hell , i 'd prefer not to look at ashley graham 's blood results ... 
   the models can still be anorexic , they just ca n't model then . 
  so where is the ban on the other side of the extreme in the same swing ? 
  why not ban models above a certain bmi as well then ? 
  it 's just as unhealthy . 
  ( well ... more long-term but still ), 
   no , the point is that nearly all are of them are slim or anorexic . 
  well , [ this website ] ( http://www.anneofcarversville.com/body-politics/2013/4/22/does-fashion-industry-promote-anorexia-do-models-eat-tissue.html ) claims 31 % had eating disorders , not really `` all of them '' but close enough ... i guess ? 
   plus size models usually are n't that obese . 
  now ** that ** is highly dependant on your definition of when someone becomes obese . 
   women exist in all shapes , why should fashion be limited to the thin ones ? 
  oh god , a `` all shapes are beautiful '' argument ...  all the media about fashion and beauty ... 
  so wait a second ... you 're saying that `` slim '' models only exist to create a beauty standard while `` plus size '' does n't , but only serves to show of the `` diversity of the human body '' . 
  you can spin that argument the other way around and end up at the same place . 
  oh great , anecdotal evidence . 
  i am aware of the differences just not sure how that factors into my comment ? 
  my point was that `` diversity of the human body '' is pretty bullshit when it comes to modelling , it 's not about diversity but showing a certain product . 
  and i 'm sorry but even `` plus sized '' is not healthy . 
   but others are anorexic because they 're being pressured by designers , their peers and the industry to be as thin as possible . 
  the surely you want to control the industry rather than the people . 
  such as force them to adopt a certain , eu-wide , code of conduct and behavior ( sexual abuse is rampant as well ) . 
  tackle the root of the problem . 
   which is why a ban on anorexic models is justified and necessary . 
  which is fighting a symptom rather than the cause . 
  the environment does shape the perception of beauty in a regard , however , that is limited to an extend . 
  there are borders to the perception of `` attractiveness '' for the regular individual based on biology and what our minds see as healthy . 
  meaning both too fat and too thin is not healthy and thus looses attractiveness . 
  but you are correct in the sense that [ the environment does have an effect ] ( http://www.livescience.com/52355-beauty-eye-beholder-environment.html ) , people will not , however , just end up aspiring to become insanely overweight or extremely bony just because they saw it on facebook once or twice . 
   people have been saying this for ages . 
  `` people '' have also been saying that the eart is really flat and the moonlanding was fake . 
   it affects models who are being pressured into being anorexic correct , however , certain individuals seem to have that odd concept that the modelling-industry is `` easy '' or a `` relaxed '' job , which it really is n't . 
  so a mixture of having to keep a certain form as well as the insane amounts of stress cause eating disorders . 
  ( similiar to how pressure and stress from school can do the same ) not helped by the fact that many of these women are rather young and can cope with the environment even less . 
   the idea of plus size models is to show diversity of the human body . 
  ah right , well , in the same way the idea of anorexic models is to show the diversity of ... yadda yadda . 
  that 's a non-argument . 
   the idea of the other models is to create beauty standards . 
  says who ? 
  you ? 
  [ not particularly difficult to find , but i guess google is still magic to some people . 
  ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ashley-graham-hottest-plus-size-6451770 )  they get spammed with unhealthy thins . 
  `` unhealthy thins '' now i 'm not sure which kinds of shopping malls you visit but last i checked h&m is n't advertising with anorexic models ... 
  currently you have many problems in libya . 
  militia factions , a lack of quality of life for the people , no real security . 
  furthermore an un backed government that does not have the means to deal with these issues . 
  libya is ( and should be ) a pressing matter for europe however , an issue that needs to be adressed just as much as russias presence in the north and east . 
  north africa * needs * to be stabilized through modern means with the long-term goal of establishing peace and prosperity in the region . 
  first , however , libya needs to be stabilized with lessons learned from the past 20 years , including iraq , syria and so on . 
  much more importantly though , the libyans have to do it themselves . 
  ( for the most part anyways ) how is this achieved ? 
  * step 1 : get the smuggling operations under control . 
  achieved via a mix of intelligence assets to identify , track and convey targets and information . 
  identified targets , including operation controllers and ships used will then be tackled by sf and naval assets . 
  to increase the effectivity , libya 's coast needs to be shutdown by the european navys , meaning no ngo 's , smugglers or whomever else will have access to the waters surrounding the libyan coast . 
  * step 2 : with a headache to europe , the un backed government in libya and a source of income for the militias taken care of , or at least under control , it is time to move on . 
  next on the list is wrestling control away from is militias and other militias on the country , this has to be done by the un backed government - however , the eu can help here greatly as well . 
  by deploying key assets with libyan troops ( drones , intelligence material , air support and sf backing , for example ) the fighting capacity of their forces is greatly enhanced , with the aim of introducing more troops from other parts of the country that are less radical and more open to negotiation , another part in which the eu can be of great assistance . 
  * step 3 and 4 : during the same time as military operations are underway , there need to be pushes for the safety of the civilian population as well as raising the standard of living . 
  achieved by funds from the eu to rebuild the country , assist with doctors and teachers and use our own expertise to train the police and military force in the background . 
  ( similiar to mali or training of the kurdish forces in syria ) thus you create a strong base for the country to stand on once the internal struggle is resolved . 
  * step 5 : ( this would actually be done much earlier but fits better here ) surrounding nations need to assist with the fight against extremism , be it in a military capacity or by cutting off supply routes for anti-government forces . 
  a potential prime ally in the region would be tunesia while negotiations with egypt could be fruitful as well . 
  * step 6 : let 's assume that the plan to pacify the nation goes well , some militias and factions are actually interested in rebuilding the nation and having a say in it , once this is all over , while others refuse and are destroyed . 
  the biggest hurdle to overcome will be the extremists and is still rooted in parts of the country which can be overcome , at that point , with deploying western combat troops and pushing them out . 
  now starts the rebuilding process that will need ** a lot ** of handholding . 
  also , this is of course not a perfect solution nor is it very refined , furthermore i do not believe in the gna to be a proper government to work with solely but would prefer a solution with the house of representatives and gna , which will only happen with eu influence as the un is way too weak for that . 
  it 's also important to note that this will only ever be possible if the eu works together in full capacity and yes , even our eastern members have a reason to do so , since it means we can idealy install a stable , eu-friendly government and not let russia take control of libya . 
  so by the same logic fat and obese models are having the same effect , yet you claim `` it would n't have the same effect . '', 
  furthermore , the idea `` it gives x the impression to be like y '' is old tumblr-ina circlejerk information not backed by modern science . 
   you think i 'm an afd supporter never said that . 
   throwing around buzzwords ? 
  because you are . 
   can talk about issues without instantly building in some prejudiced nonsense sure , if you 'd actually talk about issues that is . 
  which you are n't , you 're regurgitating facebook-level garbage with nothing to back your claims . 
   exactly why we do n't fix those issues ah yes , i 'm sure . 
  especially after those `` thousands of ex-taliban '' are now ruling the country amiright ? 
  obese models next please , thanks . 
  neither do anorexic models . 
   it 's models inspiring young people to become anorexic . 
  which is an ancient tumblr-concept since debunked , many times , by science . 
  u/ultimatedream is quite correct in his statement . 
  are you legitimately curious ? 
  'cause otherwise i wo n't bother, 
   it would filter out some radicals who think they 're going to hell if they lie about their religion . 
  many islamists never directly lie about their religion . 
  they always weasel out of the questions , a strategy which is easy to defeat if you know the right questions to ask . 
  since you are such an expert on the topic , why do n't you offer that expertise to the government ? 
  islam-experts are highly sought after !, 
   the correct question to ask is `` if a person in an islamic state is judged to be an apostate of islam according to the rules of the sharia , should that person be put to death ? '' . 
  simple answer `` since i do n't wish to cause any trouble in whatever nation i live in and if such is the rule of law in that state , then i accept that rule of law . '', 
   we did take in thousands of ex-talibans source  had extremist imam 's come and go for decades correct because , similiar to the church , the state does not get involved in religious activities and dictates who may or may not come in . 
  while it is an oversight , said situation is being fixed currently . 
   the lacking seriousness about filtering out radicals is well documented . 
  ah yes , filtering radicals . 
  the modern buzzword and equivalent of `` nonsensical '' - would you mind explaining how you want to filter the radicals ? 
  and no , `` we setup checkpoints at the border ! '', 
  does not work when we 're talking about a few hundred thousand people . 
   terror warnings from other countries , from our countries , yet nothing is done . 
  how do you know nothing is done ?
