  quite a lot is done actually , would you mind to share your insight ? 
  hey , if you 're working at the bka or bnd , maybe you can do an ama !, 
  / s  heck , we ca n't even fucking integrate turks that lived for generations in the country ah yes , the issue going back almost 50 years now . 
  but i 'm sure the afd will fix it with a fingersnap . 
   ignoring reality is n't going to solve any issue . 
  well no , of course not . 
  we just live in different realities apparently , i tend to prefer one less relient on `` perhaps '' and `` maybe '' 's . 
  nah there are considerably better and more long-term solutions for libya, 
  how does that relate to the events regarding converts and homosexuals ? 
  or are you just ranting ? 
  `` every news outlet i want to be mainstream is or is n't mainstream '' ok dude . 
  bullshit , the issue is that these events happen in asylum/refugee centers and are rarely reported or can be followed . 
  but hey , might as well ask everyone at the border `` what would you do if someone converts from islam ? '', 
  - i 'm sure the answers will give you a great insight . 
  no , we 're talking about germans who hold a dual-citizenship . 
  ( as the amount who are * only * turkish citizens is minimal ), 
  they did n't abolish democracy , they merely voted on giving the president excessive and massive amounts of power . 
  turkey is still a democracy ( in theory anyways ) . 
  this is not syria where a ramshackle syrian military fights against a bunch of fanatics on half a dozen fronts at the same time . 
  while it is an efficient way to go about things , believing the turkish military would let it come to that is short-sighted . 
  especially considering the difference in experience between the two forces , believing that a full-mobilisation of the cyprus national guard would be possible is ... naive at best . 
  well , the death penalty is ruled straight unconstitutional ( same with the eu and un rights ) which is why any citizen * voting on it * , no matter where , would act against the constitution . 
  further , any vote on such a matter will never be permitted on german soil for the same reasons . 
  ( embassies do n't count as german soil , for example ), 
  correct but it prevents german citizens from acting against the constitution . 
  cool , you can prove that he did it 100 % , no other possibilities and with all eventualities ruled out ? 
  'cause that is so insanely rare that the death penalty is just unnecessary . 
  that requires a certain fanatism , extremism and indoctrination . 
  now if you 'd like to suggest that cyprus has a population largely willing to blow themselves up in the name of ... ? 
  then go ahead . 
  because you believe the population of cyprus would resort to vbied 's and the usage of human shields ? 
  that is ridiculous . 
  well , no . 
  it 's about considering each countries capacity to stage a quick invasion and establish control on cyprus with their forces - then hold that island . 
  this was never about the greek mainland , which is why the ww2 comparison is ... * kinda * odd . 
  establishing who is better suited for that situation would require a long and hard look at surveillance and intelligence capacities of both countries , naval and maritime naval assets , aerial assets in both a superiority and cas role and especially the training and experience levels of all these . 
  which is why it 's not necessarily a clear cut . 
  ah yes , 10 % analysis and knowledge and 95 % nationalism and pride . 
  makes for a great combination as an argument . 
  now hold on , i was talking about the standards and not loony-level ridiculousness . 
  but yes , i am sure there are republicans on that level ... hell , i 'd put money on it . 
  well yeah , that is the point i was trying to make . 
  aside from that , most republicans would be very extreme , even for some eastern european standards . 
  now ** that ** is a pretty good joke , i must say, 
  not nearly as much as obama . 
  clinton was n't really much of a figure in europe , afaik , and can not recall anyone here ever talking about bush senior . 
  this is of course all anecdotal but considering how relevant kennedy still is here as a figure ( and obama ) i 'd put those two first . 
  think it has little to do with europe being more left but there simply being no other president in recent times that is as well liked in europe . 
  ( hell , last i can think of * might * be kennedy ), 
  there is something easy to support the claim . 
  mostly france = / = us, 
  a lot happened since the elections of 2016 - the afd pretty much imploded into itself and i highly doubt their ability to pose a grand-political threat again . 
  * riiight * , cause there is no critic of the eu here whatsoever , no sir / s but hey , i guess not rooting for fascism is `` europhile '' by the standards of some people ... yikes, 
  your point ? 
  would you like to claim that le pen is a healthy president for france ? 
  or perhaps that this ... uhm , `` referendum '' or whatever , is not a farce and a straight up borrowed from some good ol' dictators and their `` referendums '' ? 
   ` these subhuman genocidal maniac russians are at it again ' ca n't remember anyone ever saying that ... unless you wish to claim that mister navalny beat himself up and almost poked his own eye out . 
  oh , and thne resigned from running from president ( totally not disqualified ) did i about wrap up your opinions on these topics ? 
  perhaps , but the eu can back their claims that this is `` the best way to achieve this '' with professional and scientific backing . 
  the other side can not . 
  ( not only because theirs is somewhat non-sensical . ), 
  and ? 
  technology has to move forward with the times , that includes investing in them . 
  well , it 's not about them suffering though . 
  never will be , never was . 
  the companies will continue to bring in the same profits , however , they want to spend less money on new projects that are required by new legislation and thus resort to lobbyism . 
  a few hundred thousand euros are nothing for those companies , but it 's still percentages that they wo n't invest if it can be avoided . 
  well , there has to be transparency , however , one should not go overzealous . 
  personally i do not have an issue if a politician is flown to a specific location by a company/organization to make a point or better their argument . 
  it all has to be put into relative terms , which is why the next step imo , should be an eu-based oversight department for corruption and lobbyism , unpartial and investigating those where they detect fraud . 
  not reporting your `` benefits '' as a politician should have serious consequences , imo ranging between corruption up to treason ( since they are actively working against the state if following the instructions of a company ) . 
  all in all however lobbyism needs to be toned down , it 's one of the things why people loose faith in the government , national or eu based . 
   why would we acknowledge this terminology for this particular incident , but not for others in that same war ? 
  then go ahead and show me another incident in the wars that constitutes the definition of `` genocide '' . 
  and before you go on a nonsense-rant like the other guy , that includes the mentality-part and the physical component ( including means to doing so ) . 
   for no apparent reason well no , the reason is very apparent except for people who actively have an agenda and refuse to accept these reasons ... again , ` muh proud people ' . 
   and its diversity is much older than the political union . 
  now thats , again , some bullshit . 
  i want you to find a historic example of greek yoghurt being available in spain for the average guy and not at ridiculous prices . 
  good luck . 
  what a ludicrous statement . 
  the precursor to the eu made the economic connections , the current eu makes the political ones . 
  they all contribute to a long-lasting peace , because as the previous poster said , issues are now settled with words and pencil strokes rather than armies and tanks . 
  citing the `` atrocities '' of the world wars is kind of sad on your end , considering that humanity was never particularly concerned with the atrocities of war or the victims of such . 
   do you think uk will enter a war soon ? 
  considering the historic role of the uk and their dependance of the european continent that 's , another , ridiculous comparison . 
  so yeah , unbelievable . 
  woah , greek-made yoghurt packaged in germany being sold by a german distributor chain in spain !, 
  insane !!, 
  yeah , how dare greece manufacturers export their product to a german company who then gets it packaged and sells it in their stores across europe !, 
  how ** dare ** they ?!, 
  it 's greek-made and then shipped to germany for packaging . 
  so not at all a cheap knock-off but the real thing . 
  the solution is to set certain guidelines as to what is allowed and what is n't - add to that legislation that means every government official has to publish their benefits from a third party ( dinners paid by them , trips to locations , certain ` gifts ' ) and you have already taken strides to lobbyism becoming less of a `` who can pay the most '' - bonanza and more about expertise and who can provide the best arguments . 
  oh wow dude ... have you even read the article you 're commenting under ? 
   all three quotes have response in that block of quote . 
  considering half of those quotes were related to the length of the conflict , which , as i pointed out holds no relevance to srebrenica other than an * extremely * dodgy quote from wikipedia , that is written in a fashion very unlikely an objective view on the topic . 
   mhmm , so you decide when something is genocide and when something is n't . 
  no , the un does . 
  [ again , not exactly difficult to find .
