  ] ( http://www.preventgenocide.org/genocide/officialtext-printerfriendly.htm )  in same sense , what is few thousand bosniaks compared to hundreds of thousands of serbs , greeks , armenians , and similar people who had much more victims through 20th century ? 
  what a stupid statement , please , read it again and then think about what you 're saying . 
   just because someone kills few thousand of bosniaks does not mean entire population of bosniaks was exterminated alright for the third and last time , it 's about exterminating the population of an area . 
  30 deaths in a village is not the systematic extermination of an ethnic population of an area furthermore , there is no data that i know of , indicating that these massacres were committed with that intention in mind . 
  ( unlike srebrenica )  and even in srebrenica women and children were not targeted for fucks sake , this again ...  just like katyn would n't wipe out the polish nationality . 
  again , for the last time , quit being a troll . 
  katyn was the massacre on perceived ** political ** enemies of the soviet regime and those they saw as a threat to their consolidation of power . 
  it did n't matter if they were polish , german , czech , russian or whatever else . 
   if you ca n't see the double standards ( as do note that there have been thousands of serbian civilian victims as well in bosnian war ) in where the definition of genocide is used when related to bosnian war , then there is no point in discussing this further . 
  your own source quotes the number of killed serbs at around 25.000 ( as said by the source itself , one of the few reliable numbers ) which is , over the course of such a lengthy conflict , a victim number that is to be expected . 
  especially considering that all involved militaries had a certain disregard for the civilians of the other side . 
  so yeah , there is no genocide connotation there . 
  again , genocide is not some `` magical buzzword '' as you call it , there is a certain definition to it , you just lack the ability to grasp it . 
   anyone who has a say in it agrees implying that anyone you disagree with does n't have a say in it . 
  or anyone who knows what they are talking about agrees - funny that also includes the serbian government . 
  you now wan na try and make a `` not a real scotsman '' argument ? 
  ah right , the `` only the scientists that agree with me can be right ! '' - argument . 
  suppose you also believe in a flat-earth then ? 
  since those with a say on the topic are obviously all lying as well ... / s, 
  nice way of mixing up quotes from me that do n't correlate with one another . 
  also , your quote has a massive ( from wikipedia itself ) disclaimer writting above it and reads like written by someone who had difficulty being objective . 
  the source provided by whoever made that claim also does n't back their numbers . 
   as you said , this does not make these events any less of a genocide . 
  correct . 
  however , a genocide is always larger scale and has to be specifically aimed at exterminating an entire population of an area . 
  ( that includes having the means to do so - meaning only because someone kills 5 people of the same ethnicity , his/her acts are not suddenly a genocide . ), 
  funny that you mention those three because before that you claimed that `` thousands had been massacred '' - that 's quite a stepdown , would n't you say ? 
  but aside from that , the acts are still horrible but lack the genocidal term for obvious reason . 
  ( as i just explained )  it almost seems like you can shape these definitions to fit your narrative , huh ? 
  it 's almost like you 'd have to apply common sense and some logic to a definition to use it in a context . 
  it does n't matter that they were polish ? 
  why ? 
  because the nkvd would have done ( and did ) the same thing to any other nationality . 
  it also does n't have the very important mental bit of * intending * to wipe out the polish nationality . 
  come on man , this is not difficult . 
  nice wikipedia link that does n't have anything to do with what i said , but nice try anyways . 
  let 's read my comment again , it very clearly talks about collective punishment and not trial ( on a legal basis ) for collaborators . 
  reading comprehension 101 . 
   read up your own history . 
  oh i am well aware of the volksdeutscher selbstschutz - however , their actions ranged from full on terrorism , sabotage and genocide down to housing german soldiers . 
  you still seem to suggest that the actions of 25 % justify collective punishment , is that correct ? 
   hahahaha . 
  punishment ? 
  good job finding an article that describes the german movement from the eastern bloc in ** the 60 's and 70 's ** . 
  [ here is the wikipedia for the relevant timeline ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_ ( 1944 % e2 % 80 % 9350 ) ) with such loving bits like :  in poland and czechoslovakia , newspapers , leaflets and politicians across the political spectrum , which narrowed during the post-war communist take-over , asked for retribution for wartime german activities . 
  responsibility of the german population for the crimes committed in its name was also asserted by commanders of the late and post-war polish military . 
  or quotes such as :  karol \u015awierczewski , commander of the second polish army , briefed his soldiers to `` exact on the germans what they enacted on us , so they will flee on their own and thank god they saved their lives . '', 
  and death estimates ranging between 500.000 up to 2,5 million deaths . 
  but it 's all good , because they deserved that collective punishment , right ? 
  oh it definitly happened and i 'm not denying that , it 's just that the connotation between events in ww2 and in the late 90 's is a rather far-fetch . 
  ( i was also more curious to see his sources , if he had any ), 
   applying the same logic , that means bosniaks and croatians committed genocides against serbians as well , no ? 
  sure if you can find some sources citing large-scale events of collective killings of serbs for their ethnicity . 
  'cause i can think of only one . 
   seriously ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_persecution_of_serbs one out of two - where is the other ? 
   this does n't seem pretty political to me tbh . 
  now i 'm beginning to think you 're a troll , it says right here  of the total killed , about 8,000 were officers imprisoned during the 1939 soviet invasion of poland , another 6,000 were police officers , with rest polish intelligentsia that the soviets deemed to be `` intelligence agents , gendarmes , landowners , saboteurs , factory owners , lawyers , officials , and priests '' . 
  how is that ** not political ** ?!, 
   maybe not for you , but i think it is pretty significant detail , since majority of people act like war began in 1995 . 
  it holds little to no relevance for the event itself , which is why i do n't see the point in bringing it up . 
  very well , let 's go through your response and refute some of your nonsense . 
   people just do n't want to fall into semantic trap and group this along with pontiac , armenian , guatemalan genocides and holocaust , because while it is a war crime , claiming srebrenica was genocide just reeks of agenda pushing to the majority of the people here that does n't make it any less of a genocide . 
  ( the un has a definition on it , you know )  especially when people consider that there were dozens of srebrenicas committed upon serbs during the ww2 , and even before the events of '95 there were thousands of serbian civilians killed around srebrenica region . 
  source for both claims please . 
   claiming srebrenica was a genocide would be akin to claiming katyn massacare was a genocide . 
  no it fucking is n't . 
  katyn was a massacre for ** political ** reasons and ** not ** for ethnic reasons , unlike srebrenica . 
   also , people often seem to think that srebrenica came out of the nowhere , ignoring the fact that the war had been raging for ~ 5 years by then . 
  not at all relevant . 
  any better now ? 
  you did n't make any arguments , you rambled for a bit and then went over to whataboutism . 
  there is nothing to refute there . 
  those two sources , holy shit . 
  yes , perfectly legitimate sources , not at all biased or agenda-pushing . 
  but hey , might as well grab the first things that fit your narrative eh ? 
  what has acknowledgement of a genocide to do with personal guilt ? 
  that is the same shitty argument that 's brought up by every serb that ever felt stepped on their toes in that regard . 
  take notes : acknowledgement of a circumstance and terminology = !, 
  personal guilt of all people sharing the nationality . 
  ah so 1 out of 4 took some part in it , mind you that the definition for `` participation in the war machine '' is a very , ** very ** vague term . 
  so , since we 're apparently back to collective punishment , why not do the same to the french collaborators ? 
  just sentence all of their families for crimes against humanity as well , 'cause why not . 
  or italy - what , you fought against the fascist regime ? 
  well too bad , 'cause your brother was a party member and thus you are pretty much done for as well . 
  top argument though , no really . 
   because women and children were spared , only military age men were targeted . 
  [ even more alternative history - nsfl !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mbugm0b.jpg ) ( part of [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/avmlz ) album ) holy fucking deflection and whataboutism . 
  everyone who has any say on the topic agrees on the term of a genocide . 
  hell , the peacekeepers who ** were there ** agree on it . 
  serbs have , for some reason ( * cough * rabbid nationalism * cough * ) their head so far up their own arse that they refuse to acknowledge the obvious . 
  'cause `` muh proud people '', 
   they were humanely displaced that 's some `` alternative history '' right there . 
  ah yes , when the legal leverage over the opposition is denying them their `` rite to deni genocide '' then truly , serbia has great opposition . 
  well , it 's the same in spain , italy , czechia and so on . 
  lobbyism to this degree is the cancer of governments . 
  make it possible that they are part of common european history ? 
  yeah , i guess i * am * pretty godly . 
  do you vote for your ambassadors to other countries ?
