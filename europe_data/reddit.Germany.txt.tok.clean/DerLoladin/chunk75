  you 're approaching this from a somewhat thought out and logical standpoint . 
  do n't forget that far-right terrorism is still very much alive in germany , it 's not like they dissapeared over night . 
  that matters little as his voice is still important , both inside the government and as a public figure . 
  working with his counter-part , or at least attempting such , would also have been valuable work . 
   in his position as german minister for justice he should have tried to free a journalist incarcerated in turkey ? 
  in his position he has quite a bit of leeway and say in political affairs , do n't act like ministers are living only in their small bubble . 
  especially maas is a career politician and as such , very well connected . 
  he also would have been a valuable and major voice in the government for the release of the journalist . 
  heiko maas can shut his mouth and tape it shut . 
  he has done nothing to push for release or show that he actually has a spine - the guy is worthless beyond believe and one of the most disliked ministers in germany currently . 
  keep in mind that this is only the numbers of the ones who actually voted . 
  nato bombed specific targets in montenegro which where used by the yugoslavian military despite montenegro wishing to remain neutral . 
  only in one such attack were people killed due to the montenegrin authorities not warning the population of the attack . 
  ( they were informed as to be able to take such precautions and issue the bomb warning ), 
  but muh innocent ideology !, 
  that 's pretty much what 's happening . 
  since the mandate for the mission is running out soon , it is extremely unlikely that it will be renewed . 
  unfortunately , bases in other countries , such as lebanon , have a lot of disadvantages and would make the whole thing more expensive as well as decrease it 's strategical effectiveness . 
  yeah , government officials not being able to visit the troops , no big deal . 
  by the way , is turkey still bitching and trying to spin history their own way while helping out good ol' da'esh across the border ? 
  rather the desire for prestige of one sed leader . 
  there had already been a similiar uprising that was swiftly culled with the help of the soviet military . 
  ( the uprising of 1953 ), 
  gdr leadership really , ** really ** wanted to get mixed up in there though . 
  what ?!, 
  according to many on this sub russia is not ** ever ** holding any kind of military exercises anywhere near to other countries , they are all held in siberia because the russians are so considerate and do n't want to start a war , unlike evil nato fascists !, 
  that kinda thing has never worked and will never work , as the powerful and mighty can allways influence such workings . 
  let 's say the us ambassador to armenia gets accused of running over a group of cyclists - you seriously believe that would ever be put infront of a court ? 
  so what stops a government that `` wants '' something to just make claims up ? 
  it would , for example , enable iraq to simply state that some ambassador murdered a prostitute . 
  bodies are not hard to come by and the ambassador is the direct representative of the country . 
  yeah thats not how it works , sorry son . 
  then what would stop other countries doing the same ? 
  you oppose air-policing over the baltics ? 
  well , go fuck yourself then . 
  well , my media is n't telling me that somehow 80.000 people all collaborated for a coup against the grand sultan erdogan ... but sure , that makes perfect sense . 
  it 's so sad and pathetic how the turkish people just swallow everything that is thrown their way, 
  `` pretty sure '' does not make you right . 
  fact is , you can apply for social welfare once you are granted aslyum ... or rather , * if * you are granted asylum . 
  since the process to get anything from the state is grueling and takes for ages and does n't get you a whole lot most do n't even do it . 
  and paying for a car with hit ? 
  good for the netherlands . 
  you do n't get anywhere near that much in germany so yeah ... 
  the `` generous '' monthly pay of 150 $ ? 
  well ... if you can buy a car for that . . 
  there is something i do n't quite understand though , she claims she ca n't remember anything that happened between 2am and 6am ... yet she claims she was raped by those 9 men . 
  how would she now that it was exactly those 9 ? 
  they do n't have a choice unless they want to loose nato coverage and most likely get heavily sanctioned . 
  also remember that portugal and spain have the strongest interest in a stable north-africa , unlike the nordic or eastern european countries - so it balances itself out . 
  riiight , [ so much pro-eu propaganda ... ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ), 
  no , just stop . 
  a military plane does not even need 2 hours from , let 's say , france to bulgaria . 
  the equipment can be flown in as well and whatever is too heavy can be driven there from the closest storage facilities . 
  already explained the benefits of a european military and how a national guard ( or traditional military ) would factor into that . 
  and yes , the brexit is not a good example , considering the media campaign against the eu that has been running in the uk since the 90 's . 
  first of all , no army travels for two days in this day and age . 
  secondly , the forces would be split so you 'd have a mobilised force already in bulgaria that is then just awaiting reinforcements . 
  aside from that , since tensions would be on the rise before that , you 'd probably already have a large amount of troops before anything happens . 
  the brexit is not a very good example as the british have allways been ... ` special ' and never considered themselves a true part of europe . 
  very different on the continent though . 
  ( edit : i should add that a common european military is not something that will happen anytime soon . 
  perhaps 50 years in the future , but not in 10 or 20 . ), 
   on behalf of the french no one is fighting `` on behalf '' of someone else , but rather when the eu has to be defended . 
  meaning that if turkey would decide to attack bulgaria , that would be an attack on the eu . 
  aside from the fact that in such a scenario a large part of the surrounding countries would join in as well , it 's only logical . 
  do n't underestimate the willingness to fight for others and for common values . 
  especially in a union that has been getting closer over the years - take the eu mission in mali , as an example . 
  can think of a few great reasons for it . 
  * less money spend on new developments as they are now for the entire continent and for use of every nation . 
  * much more effective troops due to a common system across the continent , easier interaction with one another . 
  * complete independence from the us in terms of defence and military * `` together we are stronger '' - as in , a common european military makes for a much stronger target . 
  ever heard about nato ? 
   i do n't mean a german media source , they are the farthest away from being trustworthy well tough then , the afd gets very little coverage as is , since their ideas are ridiculous , but most if not all media sources are german . 
  since you do n't `` trust '' those then ... well , that 's just rough . 
  and no , not every nationalistic party has been `` shamed '' as a neo-nazi party , only if they actually are exactly that . 
  want examples ? 
  aight here we go - afd is not only composed from ex-members of the npd but also of those with a radical-right history . 
  their ideas and policies also hint towards a very radical-right leaning mindset . 
  next one is the fp\u00d6 , similiar ideas to the afd , but not `` quite '' as bad . 
  problem is , their chancellor is openly calling for an `` anschluss '' to germany ... yep . 
  next one is front national with some ... interesting remarks , especially from jean-marie le pen towards the german occupation of france and the holocaust . 
  also considers putin `` defender of the christian heritage of european civilisation '' ... yep . 
  very much rooted in reality all that . 
  so while all in all the term `` neo-nazi '' might be a bit ... harsh . 
  there are many things they share and you 'll find that these parties are filled with people who hold ... sketchy views . 
  what you * can * say about all of them is that they are extremely populistic and jump at whatever gets them votes . 
  what the hell do i care about lebanon when the topic is europe ? 
  the middle east has allways been very unstable and imploded into itself in recent times . 
  very much unlike europe which is , despite some internal back and forths , one of the most stable regions you can possibly have . 
  the afd is openly claiming that every ** german ** family should get more children , suggesting that somehow the german `` race '' is superior to , let 's say , british people . 
  what he states is :  wow . 
  if only every western woman was like her . 
  thus implying a superiority of `` western '' families/children over , let 's say , asian ones . 
  or eastern european ones . 
  and so on ... 
  the definition of racial purity is a long the lines of breeding a certain race not only superior to others but also `` pure '' in the sense of no traces of others . 
  you , for example , might have both german , polish , jewish and italian ancestors . 
  you are therefor racially - `` impure '' as your family history is not purely of one descent . 
  another example would be someone who might look like your every day dutchmen , but is mix between a dutch father and a russian mother -  racially - `` impure '' . 
  there is nothing wrong with your personal preference to how you want your children to look .
