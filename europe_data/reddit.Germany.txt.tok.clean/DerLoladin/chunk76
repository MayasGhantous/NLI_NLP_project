  while i find it a bit odd that it matters to some people what eye-colour or hair-colour their children will have , that is your choice . 
  but it 's very different from demanding racial-purity from an entire country or continent . 
  a homogenous society is not anywhere near the same as `` racial purity '' , unless you want to go ahead and defend hitler 's concept of the `` herrenrasse '' and the superiority of aryans then i 'd suggest you read up on the difference between the two . 
  yeah , as it has allways worked . 
  migration is natural and has allways occurred , there is simply no other way to sustain an ever growing economy . 
  pretending like europe will turn into mena though is fucking retarded and has no anchor in reality . 
  that 's not how it will work or how it has ever worked ( in the history of humanity ) - but keep on being retarded . 
  and it 's not your job or my job to plan for obstrouse scenarios in a european union that is n't even in the pre-planning stage . 
  you also have n't brought up any other arguments against a united european military other than `` but who would they fight for in obstrouse scenario x or y ?! '', 
  yeah and as i also said , that is not for us to decide and way to early to even discuss . 
  just like there are precautions for an internal fight within nato , there will be such in a more united eu . 
  let me reiterate  take the us as a comparison , the government troops would not fight for anyone without a direct order to do so . 
  the national guard however , is a different story . 
   so the eu would not fight for anyone unless they are , for some reason , acting aggressive against their neighbour - the units designated as a national guard for those countries might be different though . 
  just delivered an explanation to you . 
  it also does n't help that you said `` through some catastrophic even '' - well , specify `` what '' kind of event , what exactly is the scenario ? 
  you 're trying to widen the topic on something that has to be narrowed down and is not up to reddit to decide . 
  that 's like saying `` what if aliens invaded ?! '', 
  - take the us as a comparison , the government troops would not fight for anyone without a direct order to do so . 
  the national guard however , is a different story . 
  so the eu would not fight for anyone unless they are , for some reason , acting aggressive against their neighbour - the units designated as a national guard for those countries might be different though . 
  ah alright , so you 're just making shit up so you can prove yourself right . 
  fuck man , i can get 200mb/s per second from kabel deutschland and even more from t-com . 
  and i live in the ** outskirts ** of berlin - so stop making shit up . 
   wow . 
  if only every western woman was like her . 
  yeah keeping the racial purity thing strong and immigrants out !, 
  fucking hell , some people ... 
  the afd is a boiling pot for the insane and radical-right . 
  mind you , this is a party that wants to force people to have children as to keep germany self-sufficient . 
  a party that denies the holocaust , a party that has ** no ** policies other than `` mah evul immigrants !, 
  '' , a party that is cuddeling up to russia and putin and is openly advertising isolationism . 
  no , she is not fucking acceptable for ** anyone ** who votes right and is not a complete tard . 
  uhm , no . 
  greetings from my 50k internet and everyday clothing . 
  not in our day and age . 
  the european identity is still relatively strong and the `` bond '' with other nations , such as germans and dutch is very strong as well - the entire concept of firing on civilians is also flat-out stupid . 
  simply false . 
  look at north-africa or the defense of the baltic sea . 
  sure , the eastern europeans do n't have much to do with north-africa , unlike southern and western europe . 
  on the other hand , southern and western europe has relatively little to do with the baltic sea , yet other parties are much more interested in that area . 
  you wo n't find a common ground everytime , but that 's how it works in every military , even just for a single country . 
  a wants one thing , b wants another . 
  yet they can come together and cooperate either way , because they need one another . 
  that 's what it boils down to , the european countries needing one another to survive and thrive in an ever evolving world-stage with new challenges and problems at every step . 
  the military is a job and most european militaries are already fighting more for europe , than for their own country . 
  so the difference would be minimal . 
  well , i did n't downvote you but if i were you i 'd stop caring about those things in subs such as r/europe or r/worldnews, 
  the women claiming the sexual offences has come out and stated that it was made up . 
  ( edit : apparently i was mistaken , the prosecuter just retracted the arrest warrent but still keeps up the inquiry so comes down to the same thing . ), 
  so yeah . . not sure what you 're on about, 
  it 's only a 1-minute recording , almost even cuts off the `` in one of the interpretations ... '' - part . 
  so i can not say anything about the entire discussion as it is just a tiny , tiny cut out part . 
  most likely specifically for the purpose of making such an argument . 
  but if i were to go from what the man states in the article he presses that it 's part of an academic debate that revolves around the meaning of a specific part scripture . 
  adding , and this should answer your question , that there are many interpretations but daily mail and co. decided to pick out * this * specific part of his discussion . 
  im talking about moderate and modern islam and you bring up stuff that da'esh does . 
  end of discussion . 
  * you * had to deal with an entire generation of young adults , all of the ones not bright enough to make it to university are now too lazy to work . 
  grand , thanks for the insight . 
  one thing has nothing to do with the other . 
  it merely means that there are less and less well paid jobs in those branches that can rely much more on automated systems . 
  ( examples being car manufacturing ) * why * amazon is looking for such workers , i do not know . 
   because kids of that age are too lazy to work aaaand here we stop reading because it 's complete and utter bullshit . 
  why would i give a shit about what a lunatic says to drum up badly needed public support in the middle east and with his former ottoman allies - because tha 's the only reason that unit ever existed . 
  arguments - oh alright , where do we start . 
  the islam can be a perfectly fine religion with most muslims practicing it in peace and without disturbing others . 
  most people will never find out that they are muslims if they are n't asking . 
  is the quran completely fine in its ancient , over 1200 years old form ? 
  simply because it was never meant to be applied to our modern times . 
  unfortunately there is a large number of people from highly underdeveloped areas that follow a much more strict and backwater version of islam . 
  similiar in essence to the kind of christianity that is being taught and spread in uganda and certain parts of the us and south america . 
  now , does the islam have a place in europe ? 
  yes and no . 
  a modern and moderate islam , as it is practiced by most , definitly has a place in europe as it adheres and supports the democratic and western values that define europe and its people , which they are part of . 
  on the other hand , a radical islam does not have a place in europe , just like a radical christian community does not have a place in europe , as they do not support or accept modern , secular , western values or lifestyles . 
  i could go into more detail but feel like i 'm largely wasting my breath anyways . 
  here are only two of many sources [ 1 ] ( http://www.radioeins.de/programm/index.htm/psdoc=%21content%21rbb%21rad%21programm%21sendungen%21sendungen%2199%211606%21160418_eins_sondersendung_25001.html ) and [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yw-bk7-gw0 ) - if you do n't speak german either get someone to translate it for you or google both speakers , they have plenty of posts and statements in english . 
  oh , also it 's funny you 'd call me a radical left-leaning activist when most people and myself as well , consider me rather conservative and leaning to the right . 
  just with some actual thinking process and not just going full-retard ... like you . 
  have you actually listened to it ? 
  at the very start he says the following `` one of the ** interpretations ** of this is ... '' do i need to explain what a theological discussion is ? 
  sure bro , 
  there is next to no way for an administration to figure out , in good time , where someone is from or what their actual reasons are . 
  so how do you figure out where someone is from , then cut their benefits , then ship them back ? 
  all of that with as little money as possible . 
  it 's simply not possible to implement such a system that checks all these boxes . 
  a ** european ** solution is needed and not one that differs from nation-to-nation . 
  nah , there is just no one engaging in actual debate and rather talking bullshit about things they know absoloutly nothing about . 
  hey , just like you in that other comment chain !, 
  what a coincidence ... 
  ahahahaha right . 
  ** next **, 
  please google slavery before making such assumptions . 
  and you can live on those wages , just not the comfy life that many in europe and the us would like to have . 
  `` omfg its obviously they are radicals because they are evul muzlimz ! '', 
  nah , you 're just retarded mate . 
  but do n't worry , we 'll get those evul brown people eventually !, 
  ( not to say that there is allways a cause to action . 
  no criminal is a criminal `` just cause '' .
