  no radical islamist is such `` just cause '' . 
  but hey , who am i to criticise your naive world vision . ), 
  the guardian , one of the world 's best news outlets that is left-leaning but extremely factual , is suddenly `` leftist propaganda '' and is on the same level as daily mail or the sun ... are you for real ? 
  learn to read . 
  now hush hush , back to the retard cave . 
  well , glad that i 'm living in an extremely diverse area with many social issues and an area with a large muslim population as well as being well-informed in regards to the topic from both islamcritics and islamresearchers . 
  but sure , go ahead being ignorant . 
  i 'm tired of debating the topic of radicalisation with uneducated plebs on r/europe . 
  ( edit : if you were blessed with the ability to `` read '' then you might 've also spotted that i stated that social issues , rejection by peers and members of their social and age group are a large factor in radicalisation and ** help ** to pave the way . 
  not that it 's the cause ), 
  that largely depends on the kind of lifestyle you expect . 
  if you want to live in central berlin , eat out at great restaurants every two days and drive expensive cars then no , not at all . 
  but if you have your finances under control , are fine with living a bit further from the center and are not a single with children , then yes , you can live quite alright for that sort of money . 
  ( edit : i should add that it 's plenty for a young adult and with no prior job experience required !, 
  for those conditions thats great money . ), 
  the principles of a moderate and modern islam are very much so compatible with western values . 
  it 's exactly that kind of mentality and general accusation that helps to open the way for radicalisation of young adults . 
  ( note that i 'm not saying it 's the only reason , but rather that its helping it ), 
  we are living in a time of great change and many worklines transitioning to automated systems . 
  it 's not the governments job to set the wages and companies can complain all they want , however , it ** is ** the governments job to push for an opportunity that might help out the german economy . 
  and do n't forget , you can easily find work that pays `` alright '' and will enable you to get a better lifestyle . 
  ( advert i saw just yesterday for amazon warehouse ~ 1600 $ netto . ), 
  here is a factual piece to disturb the circlejerk . 
  this is not a bad idea . 
  simply because there are so . 
  insanely . 
  many . 
  trainee positions and apprenticeships and no one wants them because those jobs pay like shit . 
  companies are complaining about a lack of `` suitable apprentices '' but in turn they do n't pay enough to survive in your average larger german city nor do they offer enough vacation or a real `` future '' . 
  be they over - or under-qualified , there are too many open spots and not enough young people who want to take those jobs . 
  filling them with migrants and refugees who are willing to work is a pretty good idea . 
  ( as long as they balance the payment . 
  non such bs as receiving social salary and their apprentice salary ), 
  no , islands are not a solution for europe . 
  holding camps in the specific countries , protected by an armed police force/european border force and with a strict screening and selection process is a solution . 
  saying `` lul just put them on some island '' is n't . 
  going from the daily mail as a source to the sun . 
  what the actual fuck . 
  he also clearly states that it 's a crime , abhorrent and that the entire discussion around the topic of the scripture is of largely academic nature . 
  that 's what it is , in essence , a debate about an ancient scripture that is of academic nature . 
  i 've read the article and ca n't find ** anything ** that would lead me to believe that he is in support of such a practice . 
  it 's false . 
  what has nato access to the black sea to do with the turkish military ? 
  not really . 
  take a look at poland or france or the possibility for germany to just throw money at its weapon industry . 
  yep well , no different in the eu when one looks at turkistan . 
  there are treaties in place that guarantee access to the black sea for nato members and for the mediterranean , there are plenty of other allies . 
  18 % in germany is a god damn disgrace ... ( assuming the question was a bit more in-depth ), 
   and having to serve for mostly alcoholic idiots dat left-wing shaped viewpoint though . 
  is n't it sad that i thought `` huh , that 's higher then i thought ... '' ? 
  there is an ever so slight difference between criticising a politician and flat out denying one of humanities worst events , coupled with spreading such sentiments to others . 
  just like we can differentiate between severity of a crime and understand why a country that has a drug problem might be tough on drug-related crime , one should be able to guess as to why germany takes particular issue with holocaust denial . 
   ** only ** my view is legitimate !, 
  none may differ from it !, 
  you stated that they are protesting ** for ** the elected government . 
  a coup which , as you also stated , was `` supported '' by democractic europeans . 
  ( although i know of no political leaders who said so ) that is simply false . 
  as i said in my post before , the organisation behind this rally is related to akp and wants a `` show of force '' of their totalitarian followers . 
  haha right - now back into the basement for the crazies ... 
  there was actually a debate whether the rally should be banned as many attendees and organizers made violent threats to those opposing erdogan . 
  in the end the police force there will be massive and it will probably tolerate very little provocation . 
  and what does that have to do with this rally ? 
  very , very false . 
  but goes to show just how indoctrinated the turkish public is . 
  this rally is organised directly through an akp-related organisation , aiming to `` project power '' through their groups of influence into the politics of other nations . 
  swastikas are banned in public , for obvious reasons and you may not deny the holocaust in broad public ( speech and simliar ) but i know americans love to jerk on about such a stupid point . 
  you are allowed to state it , just not in broad public or in a speech . 
  if you want to chat at home about `` how the holocaust never happened '' then go ahead , but it will get you arrested if you make such claims in a speech or at a similiar large public event . 
  uhm , no . 
  ford differentiates into the north american sector and the european sector , with different cars and offers . 
  europeans consider us cars too thirsty , expensive , loud , obnoxious and generally just lower quality than european cars . 
  ( why buy a cadillac if you can get an e-class for the same price ? ), 
  yeah all those european countries who are not doing anything , like france , germany , britain , italy ... 
  huh , you sound like a putinbot ... now why is that . . 
  spot the retard , lads . 
  why ? 
  it makes almost no difference since those buildings and locations are instead protected by sek , who would be better used assisting ongoing police operations . 
  no one is calling for military intervention in every scenario or to suddenly point weapons at protesters . 
  but why fly in sek and mek teams from the entire area , which takes hours , when there is a military base 10 minutes away . 
  yeah , uhm , no not really . 
  simple - they can free up police officers who are stuck protecting public buildings and transportation hubs . 
  it would also allow the military to assist with helicopters to transport wounded and so on . 
  except that plenty of things , especially regarding erdolf , are very easily backed up with source material . 
  and someone told me recently `` nooo there wo n't be any death penalty !, 
  he 'd have to go througj parlament etc. '', 
  yep . . well ... just like i though , now he does n't . 
  you know who else did that in 1933 ? 
  yeah ... 
  hah , that remains to be seen . 
  problem in german politics is right now that all the somewhat left-wing parties intend to form a coalition for the next election ( so everything from center-left to extreme left ) while the cdu and csu are bickering with one another and merkel would rather sit on the left side of the political fence , apparently . 
  while you are right to a degree , the picture is much wider than just `` it 's the faith '' . 
  the biggest issue is simply that the islam is , much more so than any other religion , very open to interpretation . 
  there is no `` central '' authority like the pope to say what is the right interpretation and what is the one wrong . 
  that means that through the centuries and especially today , you have such a wide variety of preachings of the same religion . 
  i 'm certain most mosques are preaching completely normal thing , happiness , peace etc. 
  but then you have all those who take a completely different approach and interpret the islam in a much more violent and hateful way . 
  are they wrong ? 
  just like there are ( much less in quantity ) churches who preach these things , they are all based on their own holy book . 
  ** if ** you or anyone reading this understands german , there are 2 links i want to ** highly , highly ** recommend to anyone . 
  they give amazing insight into the issues that plague the islam and many muslims alike .
