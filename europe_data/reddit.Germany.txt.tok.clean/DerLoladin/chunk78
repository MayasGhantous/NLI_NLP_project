  [ hamed abdel samad on islamic fascism and many issues with islam in europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yw-bk7-gw0 ) 2 . 
  [ radio one with ahmad mansour on whether the islam fits into germany ( i do n't recommend the moderator , jakob augstein to anyone , fucking disgusting person ) ] ( http://www.radioeins.de/programm/index.htm/psdoc=%21content%21rbb%21rad%21programm%21sendungen%21sendungen%2199%211606%21160418_eins_sondersendung_25001.html ), 
  the syrian civil war began with [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_uprising_phase_of_the_syrian_civil_war ) . 
  peaceful protests that were heavily surpressed until assad began to let his troops shoot at the protesters . 
  at that point they took up arms . 
  then , over time as the civil war went on longer and longer , the islamistic groups took over more and more land , fighting against the freedom and democractic rebel movements . 
  ( assad supported them btw , the enemy of my enemy and all that ) no . 
  assad has to go . 
  that 's the end of it . 
  there will never be peace in syria with assad , he has done too much and is the very reason that this civil war is even happening . 
  russia likes him because he 's their only satellite state in the middle-east , but the assad government can not stay in power if there is ever to be peace . 
  right , all those students protesting peacefully were in secret just islamists , waiting to turn off their bearded cloaking devices . 
  there are still plenty of democractic movements in syria . 
  especially those backed by the ypg and peschmerga tend to be very secular . 
  and no , fsa is n't islamistic nor is it democratic . 
  assad is not needed for a free syria , what is needed however , is a international collaboration which will never happen , as both the us and russia will not back away from their goals regarding assad . 
  there is no democratic lybia . 
  there are 2 zones , both ruled by different `` governments '' . 
  except the op corrected himself . 
  you realise not everyone is on the same level when it comes to english , right ? 
  that people in the middle east are more ready to commit violent actions due to regional and cultural difficulties is suddenly racist ? 
  interesting ... or that muslims provide an easier base , again due to religious , personal and cultural reasons , for radicalism and terrorism is suddenly also racist . 
  amazing . 
  for fucks sake ... 
  are you retarded ? 
  so you 're suggesting a psychopath-murder is not crazy , but a product of society ? 
  because we ca n't say he has issues , that would be racist/sexist/whatever commiting such crimes such as the ones listed by u/winter-sun are the product of some very strong issues , be they of personal , cultural or religious nature . 
  thats part of the issue but there is a much larger one , that many europeans are completely unaware of . 
  many of the islamic organisation , entire mosque organisation are not self-funded , but rather funded by different islamic countries . 
  the largest one in germany for example , is funded by turkey . 
  another one funded by qatar and saudi-arabia . 
  those organisations are actively preaching `` their '' version of islam , more often than not with very hateful and dangerous undertones . 
  further , only 2 years ago they refused to help with refugees and immigrants , help them integrate . 
  guess what , just last year they were all over the idea , saying how amazing it would be if they could take these young people `` into their care '' . 
  yep ... well ... their care is radicalization . 
  why burn the books if you can just burn the people who ** wrote ** the books ? 
  much easier and they are evil putschists and gulenists anyways . 
  all hail glorious leader gollum, 
  interesting . 
  i found that eating in the `` less touristy '' places , even in spain and croatia , tends to be tremendously cheaper due to the financial natur . 
  at times it was a matter of walkign 500m further and prices for a full breakfast went from 8 $ to 4 $ with mostly self-made stuff . 
  really amazing - is that possible in the region as well ? 
  avoiding the more central areas and going off the beaten path , so to say . 
  yes , i 'm currently serving with the bundeswehr and i 'm glad we can help . 
  hopefully the supplies of weapons but non-lethal equipment , like winter gear , mine clearing equipment and vehicles , can make the fight for the kurdish fighters easier and safer !, 
  it 's sad that we can not help directly , but then again perhaps it is for the best that your country/region is growing such an experienced and well trained fighting force . 
  `` soooo . . conventional warfare it is then ? '', 
  - `` with or without the biological and chemical agents ?? '', 
  - `` who 's in favor ** for ** biological and chemical warfare ? ... all in favor , great !, 
  this oughta be interesting ! '', 
  sprinkle some plutonium on it and the radiation is also completely real !, 
  what a pointless argument . 
  you dislike that other people make some light-hearted jokes because apparently you got a broomstick up yours . 
  that 's your problem . 
  i do n't mind it . 
  my family has plenty of experience with the welfare system and while not perfect , if you 're not a lazy bum and are somewhat qualified , it 's a means until you find something better . 
  if not then it gives you the opportunity to learn something new that suits your wishes . 
  uhm , well yeah . 
  why have ridiculously expensive submarines with nuclear warheads if you are not prepared to use them ? 
  might as well safe the money at that point . 
  anyone here personally effected ? 
  if so , please speak up if you mind the light hearted approach that some people prefer to take in events like this . 
  it 's called a coping mechanism . 
  and yes , i can make fun , light and everything else of whatever i want . 
  freedom of speech and all that . 
  eh , i do n't really care about a tourist industry , when i actually go on vacation i much prefer being as far away from other tourists as possible . 
  if i do n't see a single stupid head , shirt or sunglasses for the entire duration i 'm a happy camper . 
  what is the average cost of a solid warm meal for dinner ? 
   germans are very much respected here , so you will find friends pretty quickly . 
  heh , well , i 'm glad . 
  some friends came back and told me that training the kurds is both interesting and annoying at times since they tend to do things ... well , their own way . 
  eh , i prefer humor in an event like this . 
  these things just happen . 
  every year some idiot/lunatic decided that it would be great if he/she could hurt some people ... 
  not much of a sightseeing person , for me it 's mostly about getting to know the culture , learning the differences between the kurdish people and the rest of the world . 
  allways been told that kurds are very , very different from their neighbours and an amazing bunch to be around . 
  ( very friendly and all that ) also trying to gather information for my potential deployment with the german forces . 
  trying to learn a bit of the culture , language and so on beforehand . 
  so far no one has been reported dead . 
  except that in a confined space such as this , in a panic with adrenaline rushing through your body and you being completely unprepared for the situation , chances are you 'd do more damage than anything else . 
  let me say that again . 
  guns in an enclosed space with people = big mess . 
  especially if the person has n't undergone rigorous training how to handle such a space and situation . 
  ( like soldiers or police officers ), 
  curious question unrelated to the topic at hand - would you recommend a vacation in kurdistan in the current climate ? 
  heard the region is relatively safe , as long as you stay away from the front lines . 
  ( the perpetrator has been shot by the police . 
  this was confirmed by a speaker of the bavarian interior ministry at monday evening in munich . ), 
  edit : the article states further that an arrest was attempted , during which the perpetrator was shot . 
  a secular anti-erdogan deputy mayor gets shot in the head . 
  ** what a surprise **, 
  well , the suspect has been shot . 
  so `` someone '' died . 
  according to [ this source ] ( http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/bluttat-in-zug-bei-wuerzburg-mann-attackiert-21-menschen-mit-axt_id_5741372.html ) he was shot while attempting to flee . 
  unlikely to be a terror attack , but we will see . 
  he has been shot while fleeing according to every german newspaper . 
  the greens helped a lot there , as they did n't know what they wanted . 
  cdu is only interested in $ $ $ and the spd is unable to find its own arse in the dark . 
  the energy situation in germany is so fucky right now . 
  the syrian civil war began with protests from the people .
