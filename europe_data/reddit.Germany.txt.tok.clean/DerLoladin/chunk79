  no rebels , but riots and protests that were countered with violence . 
  for gods sake ... where do we start . 
  let 's say russia would decide to attack the rest of ukraine and march towards kiev , this would prompt the instantanous mobilisation of the entire romanian and polish military , as well as the us most likely . 
  the rest of europe would most likely join in as well , since europe and nato as a whole can not allow ukraine to fall into russian hands . 
  now , georgia , the country the us has pledged to protect in case of a new conflict initiated by russia . 
  they are also part of a special nato deal and it 's only a matter of time until they join . 
  the us supports them -  most of nato does . 
  who is talking about switzerland ?!, 
  nah , i just dislike debating nato with people who do n't know its defensive policy , especially when it comes to inclusion of other countries and non-members . 
  or who do n't understand democratic values , a democratic system or , in a combination of all these , why russia is only a democracy on paper . 
  riiiight . 
  now go find some crayons and go back drawing pictures of putin . 
  tl ; dr i do n't understand how democracy works or have any clue or like to entertain any thought in my limited headroom as to why putin is considered to be a de-facto dictator by ... well , pretty much anyone . 
   most opposition organizations independent from the kremlin encounter a draconian law on political parties , refusals of registration by the justice ministry , censorship in major mass media , primarily federal tv channels . 
  according to vladimir ryzhkov , `` over the last 4 years ( i.e. 
  from 2007 - ed . ), 
  for identical `` formal reason '' nine political parties were denied registration - from left to right . 
  and not any new party was registered . 
  in modern russia , this is not possible '' . 
  weird . 
  why would he say that ... and why would the russian opposition all rally behind a single man . 
  but yeah , opposition is very healthy in russia . 
  unless you actually decide to , you know , oppose him . 
  in that case you 'll come down with an unhealthy case of radiation poisoning . 
   and if you think he 's not popular in the country for his actions as a leader he is even very popular . 
  modern russians have grown up going from one de-facto dictatorship to another . 
  they do n't mind and are quite content that it is that way . 
  i also never said he is n't popular , just that he is a dictator . 
  that you associate that with unpopularity amidst the russian people , that 's on you . 
  and in regards to nato , georgia is ` almost ' a nato member and ukraine would love to be one . 
  in the current political climate we can consider both to be nato members , as nato would react would they be attacked . 
  nato = majority of europe and is the strongest military bond between those nations . 
  and yes , i 'm sure putin is completely rightfully elected , no issues there . 
  or that he just switches positions so he can rule the country longer . 
  nah , all good . 
  oh , and do n't be part of the opposition or you 'll see jail , but that 's all democratic - everyone else is doing it as well !, 
  oh ... no ... wait ... just that turkish bloke at the other end of the black sea . 
  huh ... 
  no , definitly not . 
  however , i tend to feel a bit more threatened by a dictator who is already fighting a war in one of his neighbouring countries , with an 1,8 million strong military at his disposal . 
  so russia is not a scapegoat , but ** together ** with islamic terrorism the biggest thread that nato is facing . 
  awesome , get fucked google . 
   its mainly center right , with centrist and far-right factions . 
  all of which have strong ties to the politically very influental orthodox jewish groups and organisations . 
  some of them may not be religious hardliners but ca n't afford to go a different route due to the lobbyism influence . 
  and yes , i agree , the palestinians must compromise just like israel has to compromise . 
  the right of return is a ridiculous demand on their side , while i find israels blocking of jerusalem as a shared city equally ridiculous . 
  i 'm ignoring past history because it is of little relevance to the massive shit-hole that palestina has turned into . 
  20-30 years ago it was pretty bad , but not as bad as it is today . 
  and no , i 'm also not stating that anyone is innocent , quite the contrary , hamas is one of the worst groups in the regions . 
  both sides are guilty , both sides share a deep , deep hatred for one another . 
  but one of the two players is a leader in the region , hell , even one of the world leaders in some regards . 
  meaning it 's a make or break with the next elections in israel . 
  abbas wants talks only with international support , netanyahu wants to avoid and international attendance and rather have the talks directly . 
  two individuals want to hold talks under completely different conditions , which is no surprise since abbas was rather furious when the negotiations collapsed in 2014 . 
  yeah those things tend to happen if you match one another tit-for-tat on a political level . 
  netanyahu has held talks with palestina on one hand and another speech about the evil of all of them on the other hand . 
  but no , no , excuse me . 
  of course all palestinians are just evil jew haters and netanyahu is the grandest leader of all time , such a gracious individual . 
  if it were n't for the evil muslims there would already be peace in the region !, 
  plenty of engineers and doctors in palestina . 
  a massive amount actually . 
  sure , but now you have a potential political alliance between the most powerful country in the middle east and their rowdy neighbour . 
  ( us will probably help out as well ) you either choose attacks now and a long lasting solution or you just truck on as it is and there will allways be attacks and deaths . 
  ** or ** israel could do the resonable thing , which btw almost worked 2 years ago , and engage in talks . 
  they made massive progress , plastinians were even at the point where they considered dropping the jerusalem demand . 
  ( they want it to be a shared city ) but no , israel had to continue with the settlement expansion instead of halting that and when both kerry and the palistinians protested they said `` welp , go fuck yourself then . '', 
  but to come back to the point . 
  a proper conflict solution requires first of all a different israeli government that is not only composed of religous hardliners . 
  after that , israel and palestina can begin talks again and strengthen the palestinian government , helping to stop the hamas influence . 
  media campaigns together with proper aid distribution , for example , would go a long , long way in establishing a much better relationship . 
  quite false . 
  in every aspect . 
  terrorism is not exclusive to muslims or `` brown people '' . 
  it is rather a very common phenomena and the result of a very multi-facetted issue . 
   those barbaric actions can never be justified and like the increasing islamic terror acts in europe should only be condemned . 
  no one is talking about justification . 
  it 's an analysis which makes a point . 
  there is a reason for everything , nothing happens `` just because '' . 
  if we ignore those reasons , whatever they may be , then there is no way to change the current situation . 
  how come so many muslims live peacefully in many eastern european countries ? 
  how come the huge amount of muslims living in israel live there peacefully ? 
  there is a core root to everything and this report adresses that issue , which are the general conditions in palestina in which radical and islamic movements thrive . 
  no one is blaming the jews , but the israeli government . 
  and if you 're trying to tell me that their policy towards gaza and palestina is `` completely fine '' then i 'm gon na need therapy hours . 
  and now try to live a few generations under occupation , every now and then a few artillery strikes , tank attacks and such . 
  you can not leave the area or if you do , you have to go through harassment of the `` guards '' that are supposed to guard you like sheep . 
  do n't forget the shitty living conditions because your neighbouring state embargos the crap out of you . 
  or how their religious extremists just take your land without asking you . 
  you protest about it ? 
  enjoy getting shot . 
  as the article states , the ** psychological root ** lies with the beginning of the occupation . 
  alright let me reiterate for the more simple minded . 
  a country can and will not just support a coup , if they do n't know that its successful . 
  do plenty of eu nations and probably even the us hoped it would succeed ? 
  yeah , definitly . 
  but you ca n't go out and support it until it 's done with . 
  in this case , the economical and strategical ties are too important . 
  there is too much at stake to just go out and say `` awesome !, 
  especially if there is a good chance it 's a setup by erdogan himself .
