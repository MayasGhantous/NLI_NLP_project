  sure , mostly due to political persecution or religious discrimination , at least last time i checked . 
  so it overlaps with refugees due to persecution . 
  just like people from syria can run from isis and call it an `` accident '' while saying `` nah , we are n't refugees , but i 'd like to immigrate ! '', 
  stating however , as the op did that i responded to , that ` most ' people coming from africa * and * the middle east are immigrants and not asylum seekers/refugees is quite simply false . 
  he/she might feel/think so but that does n't mean it 's a fact . 
  since an asylum seeker and a refugee ( because of persecution ) comes down to pretty much the same thing , it can be counted as such . 
  reported, 
  `` did you just assume my nationality ?!? '', 
  but seriously , if they have only german citizenship then they are only german with turkish descent . 
  nothing is stopping them to drop that and move to turkey , but they do n't want those arrogant fucks . 
  oh it 's that time of the day again , where did i put the link ... ah yes , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a1xj0/germanys_justice_minister_defies_angela_merkel_to/d9d5xte/ ), 
  the un and eu disagree in their assessment of `` safe countries '' . 
  they want to claim stabbing attacks ? 
  well hey , they might be interested in the berlin police feed - they can claim non-stop attacks !, 
  oh please you did n't take that completely serious now , did you ? 
  christ dude ... 
  well , i mean it * is * supposed to be a creepy mansion . 
  such a thing could only help, 
  it 's the erdogan-loyalist line of how things went down and pretty much the narrative that has been pushed from the very beginning . 
  and why not , i mean it turns the whole thing into a massive win for erdogan . 
  considering that die linke is kind of his lifes work and , one might say , `` his baby '' you ca n't really fault him for that . 
  also , people who change partys do n't tend to do very well . 
  he is imo a very loyal soul and would probably bust his ass off trying to fix the party . 
  like he is trying right now with the linke . 
  his sed past is the only thing i do n't like about him , in terms of policies and ideals he is more in line with the spd anyways . 
  i 'd never vote ~ ~ sed ~ ~ linke either , but he is still a great politician . 
  never said either of these things . 
  what i * said * was that the * invasions * ( not mass killings ) of the satellite states of the ussr were internal affairs . 
  there is no disputing that , as warsaw pact membership and satellite state was pretty much equal to being a part of the ussr anyways . 
  so as i said before , i never stated that the ussr did * not * conduct mass killings and genocides within its own borders and its satellite states . 
  but statings things like  the soviet union and its communist ilk were truly evil constructs that conducted not only the biggest mass killings the world has ever seen ( as another poster did further up ) and calling them facts , is simply false . 
  calling the communists `` evil '' is a very nice and easy way not to think about any of the backgrounds . 
  if communism is so very , very evil ( just stating it like that feels like a 60 's tv advert by the us ) then why do so many people adhere to it ? 
  how did it work in china ? 
  man , china must be the evilest nation of them all in that case ... and so is vietnam !, 
  you see that such statements just do n't work in a historical context and no matter how recent it is for many in eastern europe , it is now history . 
   ca n't really see how that 's related . 
  as i said before , i took issue with the statement of `` biggest mass killings of all time '' . 
  eh , you could turn it into a creepy mansion or rent it out for airsoft games or something . 
  while slowly renovating it . 
  all just fantasy anyways , the place will soon be gone . 
   when a user here calls a pro-gay politician an `` idiot '' and `` borderline retarded '' let 's just make this very clear . 
  heiko maas is * not * pro-gay . 
  nor is the spd , otherwise they would have changed that law long ago . 
   why would any german give a shit about the rape laws or consent laws ? 
  because they were and still are a joke . 
  the punishment is weak for such an awful crime and the judges tend to be old sacks who do n't see it as `` all that bad '' . 
   why is maas useless ? 
  because , like the rest of the spd ( and to answer your question further up , no , i 'm not a cdu voter ) , he is spineless and without any ambition other than `` existing and floating around in politics '' . 
  why is this so upsetting ? 
  because you are watching a previously amazing party , the counter part to the cdu , desintegrate and commit suicide by promoting and parading morons like heiko maas or sigmar gabriel . 
  so would i. 
  hell , if i had the money ( the land probably costs more than the actual castle ) i 'd totally buy it to bring it back to its old glory . 
  and now it has turned into [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/the_abandoned_castle_%28backside%29_%28explore%29_%286646304233%29.jpg ) almost looks like the top floor burned out and they added those disgusting stairs ... 
  definitly , but the place is a ruin pretty much . 
  ( judging from the pictures on wikipedia ), 
  while unfortunate , just look at [ how many castles belgium has ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_castles_and_ch%c3%a2teaux_in_belgium ), 
  this just in : [ berlin right now !, 
  sure do , especially since i have had the , uhm , ` opportunity ' to see a pegida-demo first hand . 
  the others usually tend to be able to spell the name of the party right , when they go with the `` holier-than-thou '' attitude . 
  ( ignoring facts and history , but whatever fits the agenda ), 
  oh for fucks sake not another one of these idiots ... 
  that 's unfortunately exactly what he is . 
  and no , i 'm not exaggerating , he is a `` pretty face '' and that 's about it . 
  he never says anything relevant or at all competent , did i mention that he has recently stepped back from his proposal to ban child marriages ? 
  yeah , he is * that competent * . 
  he had ** three ** years to fix the laws on rape , on child abuse and marriage and plenty of other things and he has done exactly * none * of these things . 
  fuck yeah they do !, 
  [ here is a guy who just stood next to their protest marches with a european flag , guess what happened ] ( http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/44757/ich-muss-dagegen-aufstehen ), 
  as a german , yes , that 's exactly what it means . 
  also anti-eu , anti-foreigner or whatever else you might be able to think of that fits into their xenophobic brains . 
  maas is also a borderline retarded , useless and incompetent idiot rivaling de maiziere and \u00d6ttinger . 
  he is completely ** useless ** and has not done shit the entire time . 
  considering that there are elections next year , this is some extremely obvious pre-election talk that has no substance whatsoever , unfortunately . 
  fuckin ' hell , is there a nest for idiots like you somewhere ? 
  you allways seem to come crawling out whenever a thread is in dire need of some twatty and idiotic opinion, 
   stabbing in the public places is some good old burger tradition i suppose more a favorite among nutjobs and lunatics as well as junkies . 
  or nazis , or anti-fascists . 
  then again the last two actually prefer beating people to death , but still, 
  yeah , yeah whatever . 
  since i live in germany * and * in berlin this is now northern afghanistan . 
  man , barely can step outside anymore without having some jihadi try and blow me up or cut my head off . 
  hahaha and you probably even believe that . 
  jesus christ some people are beyond any help, 
  gysi is pretty well known for being in the wrong party for way too long . 
  sadly he 's also a loyal idealist, 
  it was more of a character-centered comment, 
  hell no , i meant the `` potential '' new chancellors who would come after merkel . 
  that 's rather depressing urgh gabriel as chancellor , i 'd rather take gysi any day, 
   is not be particularly interesting it 's also real depressing, 
   the german state serves the german people no , it does n't . 
  the official elected government and all state servants * serve * the people , the state itself does n't . 
  get your political education straight . 
   you do receive `` pocket money '' a whopping 70-120 $ , my good , they are getting rich !!, 
  fucking seriously ...  no , quotes , just sources yeah . 
  sources who obligate us to take in refugees . 
  and grant right of asylum to those who seek it , no matter where they come from . 
  and if they drop out of a god damn plane and land on german soil , then they can claim asylum here . 
   none of these say you have to take anyone who went through a safe country the suspended dublin regulation , the turkey deal and the eu-internal deals with italy specifically say otherwise . 
  well , good thing they are n't granted refugee status or asylum then .
