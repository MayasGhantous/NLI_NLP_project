  did i mention that a government will ** never ** officially back a coup ? 
  ** never ** now go and play with some crayons . 
  you can not support a military coup as a world leader/member of nato/member of the eu . 
  ** the end **, 
  well , it ** is ** undemocratic . 
  that 's a fact . 
  aside from that , it 's obvious that no government would back a ** failed ** coup . 
  perhaps you have noticed that all the `` support '' only came out after it was obvious that the coup had failed . 
  a coup has plenty of backing in the west . 
  aside from that , the country has drifted quite a bit away from secularism and more towards support of erdogan . 
  best of luck with that . 
  just saying , when the people tried that in nazi germany , it did n't go over all that well . 
  if the us would 've actually done a coup against erdogan , you bet that it would n't have looked like that . 
  you can hate or dislike the us as much as you want , but they do n't fuck it up ** this ** badly . 
  while it 's something to consider , it matters relatively little . 
  everyone is responsible for their own government . 
  perhaps not directly for the actions of said government , but since erdogan and akp are elected , this is the fault of the people of turkey and no one else . 
  akp and erdogan have been running a ** massive ** propaganda campaign through mosques and similiar in other european countries . 
  many turks have no idea what this means or what will happen , it is this blind propaganda they are following . 
  tip of the day : bail the fuck out, 
  hmm , civil war or dictatorship ... civil war or dictatorship ... 
  such an odd choice to make . 
  wait , you do n't seriously expect government leaders to support a military coup , right ? 
  muslim = !, 
  thank you for actually looking that up . 
  completely forgot that he joined an anarcho-syndicalist group . 
  aside from that , what i remember from the documentary and book about van der lubbe and his interrogation , he stated to the police `` the communist movement has come to a stop and needs to be ignited , similiar to how it was ignited in the , now , soviet union ! '', 
  ( of course not exactly what he said , but along these lines ), 
  it is not up to some conscript grunt . 
  and no , most of turkey is not islamistic , not yet anyways . 
  the decision was made and happened in the higher-up ranks . 
  the entire coup was hasty and rushed , perhaps even a fake by erdogan himself . 
  conscript follow orders or they are court martialed , easy as that . 
  and while i do not know martial law in turkey , i 'm certain the punishment for disobeying a direct order could end up in indefinite detainment or dangeling from a tree . 
  aaaand what else does it mean ? 
  correct , young adults from all religions , ethnic backgrounds , wealth levels ... 
  so hardly `` islamic families only '' . 
   what if the populace chooses wrong again ? 
  how would they do that , the akp would 've ceased to exist . 
  meaning you have a choice between the secular opposition parties , the kurdish party and another more `` central '' party which i ca n't put my finger on right now . 
  the akp has a whole range of people/groups to blame . 
  to name a few : kurds , jews , secularists , foreigners , turks living abroad who are `` unclean '' , newspapers , opposition and so on and so on . 
  everyone who disagrees , is an enemy . 
  cheeky breeki, 
  one thing after another . 
  first of all we got ta pull our soldiers out of incirlik and commence the operations from somewhere else . 
  probably wo n't happen since the base is basicly us owned but whatever ... 
  soldiers are conscripted -  come from islamic families ... wat mate , do you know what conscription means ? 
  the very second turkey seizes those nukes , they get the shit bombed out of them by the entirety of nato . 
  the country is still using f4 's so ... yeah . 
   massive anti-erdogan campaign in western media , accusation of human rights violations by eu officials , and finally the coup , as a logical enging for all this . 
  check yourself before you wreck yourself , edgelord . 
   i think now turkey will turn east , to russia and china . 
  yeah , because relations between russia and turkey are just ** fucking cozy ** right now . 
  rule # 1 if you attempt a coup , shut down ** everything ** . 
  no communication except your own . 
   they are also ineffective for dispersing crowds wut ? 
  bullets are ** amazing ** at dispersing crowds . 
  the military never announced any kind of dictatorship but rather that they declare martial law until things calm down and then have a `` peace council '' ( abiding the constitution ) govern the country until new elections can be held . 
  but yeah , totally a dictatorship . 
  while you 're at it with your ability to see the future , mind telling me what to bet on ? 
  go back , think about whats happening in turkey since erdogan has taken power , then think about why a military coup might 've been the last resort before turkey falls completely into dictatorship , then come back . 
  thanks . 
   the shutting off of power of us military bases in incirlik a more suicidal idea than when hitler declared war on the us . 
  i 'm not too sure about that . 
  one thing is that on incirlik are many nations , french , germans etc. 
  so this is meddeling with nato directly . 
  we will see which internal consequences this will have , but it 's far from declaring war on the us or any other nation for that matter . 
   if he starts aligning turkey towards isis that 's not gon na happen , i 'd think more iran rather than isis . 
  remember , many islamic leaders ( even the extremists ) have no interest in properly aligning with da'esh . 
  especially erdogan who is a mixed bag has probably more interest in his `` ottoman empire '' dream . 
  making the ~ ~ german ~ ~ turkish reich great again !, 
  the problem is , europe is already granting him ** a lot ** of leeway , simply because of the refugee issue . 
  erdogan might be a lunatic , but he is n't stupid which is why he will do a lot of it through the premierminister and `` behind the lines '' . 
  the us is another issue entirely . 
  honestly , he can do and say whatever he wants to them , obama has no more ` real ' power left . 
  so there wo n't be any real reprecautions . 
  but you are right , no one really cares about turkey if it were n't for their economically and strategical position . 
  loosing the bosporus for the nato would be disastrous . 
  i honestly believe erdogan will go berserk in turkey , now that he can . 
  he might follow the `` normal '' way , but i 'm rather certain he 'll just be able to threaten his way to the supermajority he needs . 
  afterall , no one is safe now as he can be branded a `` traitor '' and `` putschist '' . 
  why am i even arguing . 
  self-reflection is a gift , you know ? 
  aside from that , russia has n't really warmed up to the idea of democracy and probably never will , so whatever . 
  if russians , whom i barely know and friends alike , ask me how to gtfo out of russia and into the eu because they ca n't feed their families or are unable to find a job , even with master degrees then i have reason to believe the living conditions ** might ** be subpar to the surrounding countries . 
  and hey , if you like living in a dictatorship in which a human life is less worth than the bottled up bortsch in the supermarket , then so be it . 
  nah do n't worry , the rest of the world knows you guys love to live in a single-entity state with shitty living conditions . 
  his motivation to go to germany was much more to `` establish communism '' or `` tear down the nationalistic old regime '' etc. 
  that 's why i 'm saying he was an anarchist . 
  yes , he wanted to help communism , however , it 's the way he was convinced it would work and how he explained himself in the police interrogations . 
  well , 50/50 it is then . 
  you can allways write your representative , for example . 
  and you actually believe the parties will dare to oppose him ? 
  now ? 
  i highly , highly doubt that . 
  erdogan and akp wants blood and they 'll get it ( as they are already doing ) . 
  the bundestag has already been considering this , even before the coup . 
  should the country further destabilize , you bet that our soldiers are being pulled out asap . 
  if not , von der leyen will be able to mark the end of her political career faster than you can say `` flintenuschi '',
