  now if only we had a map somewhere ... 
  putin is also elected . 
  or was he elected at some point ? 
  i do n't even remember , it has been too long . 
  similiar to erdogan . 
  the good old days !, 
  aaah , how amazing the world is if we can just ignore reality ... or geographical context !, 
  yes , he can . 
  since the parlament is already in his hand , he can just change the constitution over night . 
  he already dismissed a shit-load of judges , who is going to oppose him , especially now ? 
  hell , i 'd be surprised if the soldier-murderers are even looked into . 
  except that , unlike erdogan , he can and will be blocked middle , left , right and center . 
  even more so in the courts . 
  more of an anarchist , really . 
  is he already waging war against a cultural group ? 
  is he jailing politicians , opposing military leaders and journalists en masse ? 
  is there hardly and opposition media left ? 
  is he trying ( and in a position to ) turn himself into the dictator of the us ? 
  no it is not the do all , end all solution . 
  although it may very well be the only solution when erdogan fully establishes his dictatorship after the coup attempt . 
  oh i 'm sorry , what i meant is that no one would ** ever ** put capital punishment on anyone . 
  especially not in the 70 's . 
  no , never . 
  turkey out of all of them totally did n't execute anyone . 
  oh no there were plenty . 
  not many more than there usually were though , turkey only got rid of the death sentence in 2004 sooo ... 
  you do realise most of these points are already happening in turkey right now ... right ? 
  yeh amazing right . 
  erdigan is such a fair westernised ruler that loves democracy . 
  grant , love your vision of the future . 
  even though there is no turkish military history to back that up , nor any announcement to suggest that outcome . 
  government elite and akp leadership would be imprisoned , probably for treason of the state . 
  which is business as usual . 
  families would be left untouched . 
  this is happening in turkey , not in some afghan backwater . 
  no , it would n't . 
  nato is not allowed to interfere in interior matters . 
  do you even history ? 
  the turkish military has done these coups multiple times already . 
  hell , their entire identity is based around the idea of being the `` guardians '' of a modern , secular turkey . 
  they take control and hand it back as soon as they can . 
  do you understand how nato works ? 
  they can not and will not be called to help in an interior matter . 
  ** the end **, 
   imagine the damage he would take if evidence would appear that he has orchestrated this just like any big political move ever . 
  that 's why you do your best to cover everything up . 
  ** next **  the people would do it themselves . 
  would n't be too sure about that . 
  due to his massive backing from the religious body in turkey , he could probably downplay it to a minimal involvement or simply `` not taking it serious enough '' . 
   why should they particpiate in such a plot ? 
  there are a number of great options to make people do what you want !, 
  blackmail for example . 
  or threatening their family . 
  or buying them . 
  the mit wo n't have much difficulty just shipping them off somewhere once the show-trial is over . 
  fact is , no one actually knows . 
  marius von der luppe was a slightly deranged anarchist , not exactly someone you would put in close relation to the nsdap leadership . 
  a lot of berlin police officers also give testimony to what they saw and heard , also the interrogation reports with von der luppe are still around . 
  ( back then the police was by no means in close relation to the nazis ), 
  nah they are doing both right now . 
  islamo-fascism does well in turkey and other me states . 
  holy shit , that i get to see this . 
  people arguing ** against ** secularist and pro islamo-fascism . 
  amazing . 
  are you retarded ? 
  do you know how many ukrainian refugees poland has taken , for example ? 
  or any other eastern european nation ? 
  erdogan is pushing against secularism and has granted the islamists in turkey ridiculous amounts of power since his rise . 
  so yeah , they align with him and would do almost anything to keep him in power . 
  riiight ... satellites were trying to overthrow assad , not his own people . 
  i allways forget that part . 
  huh ? 
  the turkish military is n't interested in a military dictatorship . 
  a large portion of their entire modern understanding is that they are `` guardians '' of democracy , a secular state with a fair government . 
  no executions most likely , life long jail time in a dark hole probably . 
  but regardless , it will be mid-level officers taking the fall in such a case . 
  thanks for summing those up , thinking about it thats the first that came to mind . 
  the military leadership is probably rather fed up . 
  hardly a democraticly elected leader at this point though . 
  so far it certainly looks like the military is pretty united in this . 
  and erdogan has been treading the line , hell , i 'm pretty certain he had most of the `` old guard '' leadership locked up . 
  this can either end amazing with a more secular and stronger turkey ** or ** really , really badly . 
  nato will not and can not get involved . 
  the soldiers there will only resort to self-defense if necessary . 
  exactly . 
  are you serious ? 
  might wan na look up the history of coup 's and you will find that many were for the better . 
  civil war is not an option in turkey . 
  it 's literally part of the turkish livestyle . 
  did i mention the ** massive ** military they have ? 
  the coup is either successfull because the entire military is backing it or it is n't . 
  i 'm curious what the actual reasons are , the turkish military is not known to just initiate a coup willy-nilly . 
  the turkish military has a history of stepping in if the government `` goes too far '' and then handing control back , once a new government is in place . 
  good example . 
  it was also a much more political approach which is even more dangerous . 
  ( pakistan is a great example for the terrifying consequences of political terrorism ), 
  it 's not ** our ** morals , we do n't have some kind of single-right on them . 
  people are complaining about `` interventionism '' in the middle east and how we should mind our own affairs and in the next sentence they complain we are n't active enough against china ... what happens on the other side of the world , the bickering over a whole islands and a sea region , is none of our concern . 
  if there were a war then yes , perhaps we should do something about it . 
  but as it is , the eu is doing plenty in already helping and advising the smaller countries bordering the south chinese sea .
