  and why exactly would any european nation do that ? 
  it 's not our ballpark and concern . 
  we also need the trade , especially nowadays . . 
  the thin stretches of autobahn for our eastern european lorry drivers . 
  it really is n't . 
  europe has experienced its fair share of terrorism , nowadays its much closer to every one of us through the internet and `` knowing '' people from that country . 
  life-wing ? 
  but ... i 'm pro abortion d :, 
  even better question ? 
  is there perhaps a difference between cultural groups ? 
  those muslims living in bulgaria are completely different to those in france . 
  ** next **, 
  same argument can be made for the left . 
  ( not sure what her name was anymore , but someone from die linke had a cake thrown at her because she said `` we ca n't help everyone '' ), 
  how is pro-refugee not left ? 
  from my experience of reading the front page of the bild and bz everyday , they switch sides all the time . 
  sometimes extremely pro-refugee and next week anti-refugee and so on ... 
  yup , except you can not even back up or properly construct your arguments . 
  i 've now tried 3 times arguing with you and every time you just abandon ship, 
  we have many other scenarios where europe needs to intervene to keep existing . 
  most of all , african conflicts . 
  we do not have the benefit of the us of being covered on both sides by massive oceans . 
  our long-term security relies on a stable north-africa and middle east, 
  back when airbus began working on the a400m they were nowhere near in size where they are now . 
  there were also dozens of new firms created only for the parts of the a400m . 
  all in all the aircraft is a raggedy economics project for all the involved eu countries more than anything else . 
  nato is making an effort but many powerful political groups across europe need the russian propaganda to fuel their political campaigns . 
  ( perhaps even funded by russia ) and will fight tooth and nails against such plans . 
  yes , when it comes to comparing the telegraph with a story from the guardian perhaps . 
  not with rt and sputniknews sadly , since they resort to publishing flat out lies and not a different viewpointm, 
  it 's the same for other newspapers or blogs with thousands upon thousands of viewers who are an outlet for left-wing propaganda . 
  every political side has their own site or newspaper they turn to to misinform themselves . 
  funny , you sound like you actually believe that . 
  if someone is truly in a state where their brain activity has reached zero and there is no chance of them ever coming back , then it is my opinion and personal wish ( for myself ofc ) that the plug is pulled . 
  someone in a coma has/had these abilities , but can not use them as of that point in time . 
  rather different to something that has , up to that point , never been in posession of these capabilities . 
   a man , woman , or child of the species homo sapiens , distinguished from other animals by superior mental development , power of articulate speech , and upright stance . 
  http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/de/definition/englisch/human-being a fetus is not in posession of any of these , for example . 
   spreading of her genes , which , as i said , is the only purpose of life . 
  not today anymore it is n't . 
   like stem cells from the baby healing the mother healing the mother from organic injuries ** inflicted because of the pregnancy **, 
   parasitic relationships a parasitic relationship is one in which one organism , the parasite , lives off of another organism , the host , harming it and possibly causing death . 
  the parasite lives on or in the body of the host . 
  http://www.necsi.edu/projects/evolution/co-evolution/parasites/co-evolution_parasite.html curious , huh ? 
  so , a fetus is draining resources from the mother - check . 
  a fetus has negative side effects for the mother - check . 
  a fetus does not have physical positive side-effects for the mother - check . 
  but it 's not a parasite . 
  interesting new definition of a well established biological truth . 
  what does the body of themother ** factually ** gain by keeping the fetus alive ? 
  ( and no , `` reproduction purpose '' is not part of that since it entails nothing physical but merely a goody feeling . ), 
  again , that matters very little . 
  or are you suggesting that a fetus can live perfectly fine without sustenance from the mother ? 
  that the mother does not have any side effects of the pregnancy . 
  i 'll be intrigued if you can back that claim . 
  a parasitic relationship is not exclusive to 2 species but certainly possible within a species . 
  and it does not matter whether the only purpose is reproduction . 
  the product of said reproduction holds a parasitic relationship to the mother . 
  apologies in that case . 
  but where does your definition come from , then ? 
  based solely on the fact that they tend to be created via sexual interaction of two human beings ? 
  in such a case , all art would mean any offspring from such methods would not be human . 
  by your definition , as a fetus is `` vaguely shaped human '' but most definitly not a human , apes should fall under human rights as well ? 
  how i see it , a fetus/embryo/whatever is not human till the very late stages of a pregnancy and no one , not even a potential human being , has the right to ruin someones life just because some people would like it that way . 
  instead you end up punishing two people for the sake of keeping life ` holy ' . 
  funny enough that in most societies nowadays abortion is the only topic where life is considered holy or ` sacred ' . 
  which is simply wrong . 
  you wan na have children ? 
  grand , have children . 
  you do n't and are a teenager , victim of rape or just forgot to take the pill or whatever ? 
  you should n't be punished for the rest of your life for that . 
  except i 'm making my mark in the world , working for my own living without harming others or draining off others in the process . 
  look up the biological definition of ` parasite ' . 
  a fetus is exactly that , living off a host for no positive effects and/or only negatives . 
  a fetus is not a human being . 
  depends , when does a fetus get to the point of being able to feel emotion ? 
  when does it have an overwhelming amount of human qualities ? 
  i can not answer these questions but from what i understand , the overall consent is around 3-4 months for a safe abortion , as one should n't forget it also entails serious health risks for the mother . 
  however , a doctor should be able to grant the right for a longer ongoing pregnancy , since in some cases it only shows up very late and/or in rape cases where the victim did not dare to go to a doctor . 
  perhaps it 's different from location to location , but i 've never met anyone , regardless of age who brought flowers unless it 's a very special occasion . 
  ( a birthday or some such ), 
  it does n't even mention the ecb . 
  nor was merkel ` against ' helping the italien banks . 
  italy wanted to do it 1-way ( their own way ) germany says they got ta stick to the rules like everybody else . 
  ** its a conspiracy everyone !, 
  you only give flowers to ** really ** good friends or if you 're hitting on someone . 
  can people shut up about the whole `` oh its in the control of germany ! '', 
  its getting to the levels of `` the jews did it ! '', 
  freedom of choice . 
  its their body and just like you are allowed to get an increase in breast-size or fake-muscles as a guy , every women should be able to decide what to do with her body . 
  a fetus is , for the most part , a parasite ( literally ) . 
  a fetus is , for most stages , a parasitic entity thats part of the females body . 
  as such , until a certain point where we can consider that its experiencing ` human ' feelings ( emotions , receiving signals etc ) imo an abortion should be fully at the discretion of the women . 
  eastern germany has allways been a haven for right-wing extremists . 
  that is not to say that it should remain that way , but it 's rather difficult to fight against the strongly ingrained xenophobic standart that is the basis for social interaction with `` non-german outsiders '' in many rural areas and villages . 
  similiar to , well , many rural areas around the world . 
  however , it is also an issue in big cities such as leipzig , but much more so on both sides . 
  just last week i read an interview in focus ( i think ) with the leipzig police chief who complained about a huge amount of violence from both left and right , yet that he does n't have the means to fight both , especially if one side is being completely ignored by media and politicians . 
   many , many of these instances go unpunished yeah , but not necessarily due to political bias . 
  first of all , many of these events happen in rural areas with the suspects being masked .
