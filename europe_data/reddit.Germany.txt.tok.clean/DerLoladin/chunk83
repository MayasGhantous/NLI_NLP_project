  it 's very difficult to extract information from the residents in the area , since they did n't want that refugee-shelter in their village to begin with . 
  secondly , you have an far , ** far ** overstretched police force thanks to both spd and cdu continuing with their `` less is more '' rhetoric for both the police and the military . 
  there is an estimate that the police in germany requires over 15.000 more officers !, 
  and lastly , german laws in these cases are pitiful . 
  if there is even a conviction . 
  similiar to violent riots from left-wing extremists , a lot of cases are just thrown out due to a number of reasons . 
  be it lack of evidence , intoxication , mental illness ( all claimed ) and so on . 
   there seem to be many groups involved , many of which do not condone violence . 
  that 's just tough shit . 
  if you have a peaceful protest and are next to a group of people who start throwing molotov cocktails and/or bricks , you get the fuck out of dodge and do n't stick around . 
  once a peaceful occupation turns into borderline domestic terrorism , you do n't debate or haggle with them , you remove the thing that causes issues . 
  rather i 'd argue that they can be happy the authorities let them go ahead with what they did for so long . 
   you confirm that riot police are hardcore and need to be brutal . 
  that is the case in berlin , because it has to be that way . 
  look up 1st of may riots from 10-15 years ago . 
  there are demonstration , rallies , marches of many groups here all the time and they can very quickly turn violent . 
  to protect themselves and the peaceful protestors , riot police in berlin are swift and brutal . 
  that has nothing to do with a lack of trust in the police , berlin has allways been a hotspot in that regard . 
  violent harassment is something neither i or any friends ( of all ethnic backgrounds ) have experienced , as long as you are at least somewhat nice to them . 
  if you are n't , well , that 's on you . 
  really not his fault . 
  pretty much every referee article i 've read about it states that it was a normal move , trying to reach the ball with the head . 
  something you just do n't give a penalty for, 
  because there is no one else on that position, 
  just ... what . 
  the csu is a conservative party of the right-wing . 
  it 's not going around , hunting and scrabbeling for every voter it can get like the afd . 
  nor is it reliant on single issues . 
  the csu is more conservative than right-wing when it comes down to it . 
  a far-right party is indeed afd or npd . 
  most definitly not csu . 
  uhm , yeah ? 
  that is common knowledge . 
  cdu is ( supposed ) to be center-right while the csu is a little bit more to the right , both still center orientated . 
  die gr\u00fcne / b\u00fcndnis 90 are in some areas center-left but tend to be very left in most . 
  normal for berlin , really . 
  they went from beating each other to just beating police officers . 
  violence against the police from the left has gotten a lot worse over the years - and nobody cares . 
  are you calling the greens a center party ? 
  are you out of your god damn mind ? 
   calling the leftists terrorist that he wo n't negotiate with because that 's exactly what they are . 
  they light up peoples cars , destroy the surrounding area and go after people crossing through `` their street '' . 
  an spd bloke called for `` talks '' with them , which the innensenator , luckily , immediately shut down . 
  why is that good ? 
  simple . 
  imagine it was the other way around , right instead of left . 
  the spd would be ** furious ** if anyone even mentions talking to them and would send the police in faster than you can say `` political bias '' . 
   there were many police men who clearly enjoyed the prospect of being able to escalate the violence and used unnecessary force in breaking up the protests . 
  welcome to berlin . 
  riot police here is not pussy-footing around if they get attacked - that 's what makes them so effective ( because they have to be , especially here ) but also gives them both a good and bad reputation in the entire german police force . 
  alright , where do we start ... first of all , nato is responding to a russian threat to the baltic nations . 
  now you will say `` but there is no threat ! '', 
  - oh , there is . 
  nato did n't actually commit any troops to the baltics until 2008 , the georgian war in which russia demonstrated that it is more than willing to wage war against its neighbours . 
  after that you had cyber attacks , russian military exercises ( which include the nuking of warsaw ) , a huge amount of investment in military equipment . 
  then in 2014 the annexation of crimea and now war in eastern ukraine . 
  nato is doing exactly what it 's meant to do , defend its members against potential enemies . 
  this includes deterrence against a russian federation thats more aggressive than ever before . 
  mind you , deterrence coupled with continued talks , inviting russian military observers to ** all ** nato exercises in the area and so on . 
  unfortunate part is , russia is not very reliable when it comes to promises , talks etc. 
  as they generally just deny everything . 
  an offensive coalition would mean that nato is actively engaging another force as the aggressor , which it is n't doing . 
  anyone who claims nato to be a `` offensive coalition '' has either no clue about the political and legal backing , what the word means and/or is retarded . 
  ( die linke tends to mix all 3 of these things when they throw around the word `` but its against da constitution ! '' ), 
  rather than debating your odd `` because a survey says so i 'm right ! '', 
  statement , i 'll go into ` why ' that is . 
  germany has had probably the strongest economical ties with russia of all the european countries . 
  this was helped by a generally very russia-friendly left side . 
  ( spd , die linke , gr\u00fcne ) and an economical-minded center-right ( cdu ) . 
  the next part is that news about the conflict in ukraine or the annexation of crimea are not all that `` big '' in germany . 
  the government deliberately downplayed it due to fear of an economical backlash with russia - which did n't matter in the end , since sanctions were imposed anyways . 
  next is a generally badly informed public about nato , not helped by the general anti-military mind of germans in general . 
  and last but not least , russia propaganda , such as rt and their youtube presence ( especially aimed at teenagers and young adults ) is huge in germany , with so much bullshit that you could make bio-fuel instantly a business . 
  remember the `` news '' about the supposed rape of a 13-year old russian girl by refugees ? 
  yeah , that came from rt in germany , turned out to be completely made up . 
  funny that she is russian too , huh ? 
  edit : once again the commentator u/romek _ himself evades any kind of discussion where his points might be rebuked . 
  why am i not surprised ... 
  nah , russia got k\u00f6nigsberg ( the little semi-island ) the former capital of prussia , while poland got all of eastern prussia and czechoslovakia the southern blip of eastern prussia . 
  you claim he should be in jail or be slammed for those attacks because he is the highest military official ? 
  that 'd put every political leader in a pretty bad spot whenever one of their soldiers commits a crime ... 
  germany is stepping up their military commitment . 
  very slowly though , since the left is all over that, 
  yeah right . 
  then how about you stop spouting bullshit in nato - russia related post , without any facts to back you up . 
  or , even worse , state some crap , get proven wrong and then back out . 
  that comparison does not work for a whole number of reasons . 
  did the us plan to bomb those targets ? 
  gave obama the direct order to do so ? 
  did he personally oversee preperation and execution of those attacks ? 
  plenty of eastern european countries still remember the russian dictatorship quite well and what a fucked up time it was . 
  aside from that you have a lot of ** very ** real threats coming from russia ( massive border deployments , military exercises where they train nuking warsaw , cyber attacks against estland . ), 
  also , if any nato article 5 guarantees a war for all nato members , meaning that the threat-scenario is very real for all members . 
  ( as it is supposed to be ), 
  russia = nation that only wants peace prevention against russian military actions = risking ww3 wat ... 
  do n't forget steinmeier shortly before the summit ... really , it 's embarassing . 
  oh you 're that kremltroll again that i tried to have an argument yesterday since you only talk crap . . 
  you are aware of nato article 5 ? 
  if russia decided to attack one of the baltic states , it would mean war for all of those who you claim to be ` not-threatened ' as well . 
  wow !,
