  i did not know the us president himself is the one shuving a jet engine up his butt , flying over the middle east and dropping bombs !, 
  all makes sense now, 
  yeah i know , reading is hard ... 
  those who ignore history are bound to repeat it, 
  right , that 's why nato is inviting russian military observers to all training operations , is constantly holding talks . 
  also why many european countries are wanting to negotiate while also granting security to their nato-allies . 
  now , does russia invite nato-observers to their operations ? 
  ( like the one where they trained nuking warsaw ) or how well does talking with russia go ? 
  wait , someone is on the phone right now and he is saying `` crimea 2014 ! '' . 
  odd . 
  and germany will most likely do that . 
  especially with the brexit . 
  yeah totally !, 
  nato began the georgian war , annexed crimea and is right now waging war in ukraine ... 
  yeah no difference between tourists and an invasion force that 'd love to create soviet union 2.0 ... 
  while certainly similiar , for me there is still a difference between attacking those who 've been living there for years and refugees that a lot of people , villages , hell even entire areas do n't agree with or want to have around . 
   kohl population will rise slower though , due to a large amount of chain-smoker in the population, 
  i 'd suggest adenauer instead of erhart, 
  a-huh . 
  now take those swastika-curtains down and take a look at the real world . 
  ** perhaps ** people would be willing to discuss issues with you if you did n't shout `` conspiracy ! '', 
  or `` oh ma gawd immigrants everywhere !, 
  remove pc remove left ! '', 
  well , this is again all based on the argument that you want to do something illegal but ca n't do it freely . 
  and gema is a shitty institution but kinda irrelevant due to spotify . 
  i appreciate being able to download game updates at high-speed and can afford the occassional game . 
  you could also allways use a vpn, 
  fuck the telekom , seriously . 
  they are only protected because they are a massive german brand representing the country internationally ... 
  no but i 'd wager luxembourg is much more expensive than berlin or frankfurt and so on . 
  that 's because the wifi-provider , such as a caf\u00e9 or such , will be charged if anyone does anything illegal with it . 
  this will change very soon however , which will pave the way for more wifi . 
  if you see the only use for internet in torrenting then ... well ... 
  it 's uncertainty . 
  and if businesses and the market hate one thing , it 's not knowing what will potentially happen, 
  was n't housing ridiculously expensive ? 
  what a bunch of crap . 
  you can easily get 100mbit and if you take a deal with a 2gb data cap then thats on you, 
  yeah !, 
  in the eu there are no chances for poor people ... oh no wait ... there are !, 
  plenty even, 
  oh i did not know you are blind , my mistake . 
  someone with sight and some experience with alcohol will see how drunk he is . 
  you ... do realise he is fucked out of his mind on alcohol ? 
  i mean , you can almost see the smell, 
  the us is n't an organisation , first of all . 
  secondly , larger economy , larger military , larger science devision ... 
  [ `` rumors '' right ... nothing but rumors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpgii46fcdu ), 
  read my post again . 
  then think about what you just said . 
  then come back . 
  should you arrive at the same conclusion i advise you to visit a psychiatrist because you might be a bit mental . 
  do n't care about his stance as of now . 
  i care about him being one of the faces of the eu , representing every european citizen and holding talks with other global leaders . 
  while you may be completely fine with having an alcoholic represent you , i do n't , thus i do n't give a toss about his stances and policies if the man ca n't even get a grip on his own life . 
  [ no truly , an amazing person . 
  well deserved to be in such a high position in the most powerful organisation in the entire world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpgii46fcdu ) you are , of course , absoloutly right . 
  how could i possibly think that this ** machine ** of a man would be unsuitable to lead the european union ... 
  did he find his `` vision '' at the bottom of a gin bottle ? 
  because if not than i 'm curious how that vision looks like or will ever come to pass . 
  no , it 's not hard , i just did it . 
  if someone is completely off their hooks half of their meeting times because he keeps on chugging one gin tonic after another whenever he can , then i call that what it is - incompetent and a drunk who should be nowhere near politicis on such a scale . 
  except that juncker is also a drunk and an incompetent cretin, 
  mayhaps my perception on that issue is a little distorted , considering that i 'm from berlin , but i have yet to meet someone who considers turks , who speak fluent german , hold a german passport and so on , as foreigners and not part of our society . 
  what ? 
  really ? 
  may i ask which city ? 
  ( if its munich im gon na laugh ), 
  are you retarded ? 
  oh wow the last part is actually really scary - that 's the same rhetoric the nazis used in regards to the jewish businesses . 
  what a load of rubbish, 
  oh please , meeting a turk who speaks fluent german without using `` vallah lan alter schw\u00f6r '' at the end of every sentence is insanely rare . 
  and yeah , they do n't consider themselves german so why should everyone else ? 
  on the other hand , those who do make the effort , do n't see why they should n't be german ? 
  they still could voice their opinions , however , if someone goes so far to say these kind of things to their neighbours , friends etc. 
  beat up someones grand-child because they are not ` english ' then yeah , you are a xenophobic shithead . 
  do n't bring this `` it 's the pc 's cultures fault ! ', 
  bullshit in here . 
  some peoples concerns were indeed silenced by a certain crowd , but do n't pretend like that turned them into vile individuals filled with hate . 
  more like `` it 's the jews fault ! '', 
  we 'll replace britain with you lot eventually, 
  nah in the studio the younger guy , a total knob , even said `` that was inappropriate , we do n't want to draw the brexit into this '' fuck that guy, 
  orange can come back !, 
  perhaps ... until then you can cheer for your eastern border-brothers !, 
  it 's pretty awesome that every continental country seems to share the same sentiment in that regard . 
  ( and sense of humor ), 
  iceland played an amazing match - england fucked up royally . 
  ( ha ) it 's insane since the entire icelandic team is not even worth half of a single english player !, 
  ( sterling ), 
  on german tv : `` after the brexit , we now have the exit '', 
  on brexit followes the exit . 
   because english is a language that many people throughout europe learn , it seems like it would make the uk an easier country to move to than say , a non-english speaking country that would require another language for work . 
  yes and no . 
  many countries in europe , on such a highly professionell level , offer those jobs in english . 
  i know for a fact that most of my local hospitals have doctors who are still in the process of learning german and thus communicate in english . 
  no problems to be had . 
  that 's modern europe nowadays , most larger cities are becoming very multi-cultural with a heavy focus on english . 
  hell , at times there are more people around me speaking english than german !, 
  also consider that the nhs is not on a good track for a health service . 
  ( not saying it 's bad , just that it has gotten worse ),
