   if the answer is yes , then it simply does n't matter if less people want to come to the uk if the answer is still a bigger number than they can accept . 
  this is about highly sought after personnell , like doctors , engineers , managers etc. 
  to whom other countries , which also tend to offer their jobs in english on a large basis , might be more attractive now . 
  only over my cold , dead body, 
  franziskaner for german beer ?!, 
  ** bloody heretic !, 
  their own , sweet patriot act ... 
  because some of these rules are binding and the uk does not recognize them and would rather use their british rights bill ... or something like that, 
  you do n't need a carnet for island or norway . 
  perfect example , thank you . 
  you have daily mail , we have bild - a shitty tabloid for everyone !, 
  his statement from 10 days ago was `` there will be economical consequences , both for the eu but also for britain '' that 's not a threat but a logical conclusion to something called `` economical change '' . 
  everything is a fucking `` threat '' for leave voters apparently , jesus christ ... 
  source, 
  germany has pretty much come out and said `` plz stay , we wan na be friends ! '', 
  so yeaaaah ... 
  damn immigrants , even stealing our newspapers !, 
  do n't forget that europe and the us live in a symbiotic relationship with one another - the us is economically dependant on europe , while europe benefits from military security . 
  meaning the us makes boatloads of money while smaller countries in europe can focus on economy and prosperity -  giving back to the us . 
  europe , as a whole , is relatively close to the power of the us . 
  however , nato can not exist without the eu since even the us need their european partners as they offer amazing training opportunities and much , much more importantly - a beachhead in europe . 
  then again , i 'm of the opinion that germany desperately needs to get off its ass in terms of military budget . 
  one of the biggest world players in terms of economy and politics yet we only fulfill 1,2 % form the 2 % of nato quota . 
  nor is any other country in europe by that definition . 
  all rocket shields are under nato control . 
  germany is one of the main nato partners in europe , not only because of the many military installations but also because of our very modern and well trained military force . 
  haha , germany with wmd 's under our control . 
  that 's a good one . 
  where exactly ? 
  germany can and is providing protection to poland just fine . 
  aside from that , we have a rocket shield over europe soooo ... yeah . 
  small difference between pkk and peschmerga and ypg/ypj . 
  ( although less towards the latter ), 
  except erdogan did fuck all for the economy and merely enjoyed a public opinion wave because of it . 
  tornados will be replaced by a new project - this has already been announced , we jusf do n't know with whom yet . 
  and yes , germany has to ask for permission to use those nuclear warheads , they are still at our disposal . 
  good thing germany has that . 
  oh get off your high horse . 
  if it was ` disputed ' whether a shooter shouted ` allah ahkbar ' before he fired and happens to be of brown skin colour , you would n't call for ` careful consideration ' and ` not jumping to conclusions ' . 
  source for ` most ' - from what i 've seen 2/3 are certain and the last just does n't know . 
  that 's actually really funny - thanks for the chuckle . 
  they ** are ** fully turk-german mp 's though , which is the funny part . 
  so i suppose they are n't `` true '' turks because they did n't do what erdogan wanted them to do . 
  not yet perhaps . 
  we shall see what the future brings and where the country goes . 
  funny , just recently erdogan went on to say that german mp 's have `` impure blood '' and are n't `` true turks '' - strong similarities in the statements , would n't you say ? 
  must be fun living with a distorted sense of reality , so many truths to ignore ... 
  [ no prob bro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_party ), 
  right , right . 
  akp lacks 2 letters you know that ? 
  sure thing bro . 
  it 's gon na be fun when people complain about erdogan after the country is wasted economically . 
  whow , do n't mix apples with oranges . 
  the ottoman turkish forced emigration is one thing , but that was not genocide , nor extermination . 
  but forced emigration , similiar to germans from poland and eastern prussia after world war 2 . 
  the armenian genocide is called such due to the systematic rounding up and followed extermination by various means , of a certain ethnic group . 
  now you may dispute numbers , but the fact remains that during the first world war , the ottoman empire systematically tried to eradicate the armenian minority within its borders . 
  that 's unfortunate - then again my view might be a bit skewed since i 've been born and raised in berlin , which is very multi-cultural in its very essence . 
   this is not correct . 
  yes and no . 
  while you are right , lots of these newspapers will follow the akp line if properly `` encouraged '' . 
  armenian genocide recognition coverage makes that very clear . 
   as for social media , opposition is dominant in nearly ever single turkish online platform . 
  oh i 'm certain it is - but just 1 finger snap away from going away ... ( yes i know you can use vpn 's ) regarding the making up of the government , i ca n't really comment on that . 
  the point i was trying to make though was the influence this would most likely have , which i 'm sure you can see . 
  ( as it would be no different in other , similiar countries ), 
  people like to blame merkel for a lot of things , but i 'm not sure which one it would be here . 
  the refugee-deal ? 
  best thing that could 've happened for us in a while , saved austria from an ( almost ) extreme right-wing president and has the added bonus of making it clear ** who ** is to blame , should the refugee influx on greece increase again . 
  ( hellooo sanctions in that case ), 
  erdogan has full control over the media , such a `` win '' over the eu would be paraded up and down and squeezed for every last bit of propaganda gain he could get out of it . 
  ** especially ** now after the german recognition of the armenian genocide . 
  economy yes or no , basically shitting on the eu by openly saying `` get fucked brahs '' ( not a quote obv . ), 
  and still getting what he wants is a sure way to impress all the voters in turkey , who value a `` strongman '' . 
  while true , imo we have a responsibility not to lend any aid to dictators , politically or financially . 
  1,5 of those 3 million are german but just like the rest they can feel free to move to turkey . 
  keep in mind that we also have a pretty large number of ethnic russians in germany , none of them decided to go up and arms when sanctions were put on russia . 
  36 billion , not as much as with russia and we sanctioned them too . 
  careful what you wish for . 
  if turkey were to open the flood gates it would mean sanctions for turkey - sanctions which would drive the country into ruin most likely . 
  enjoy your sanctions then . 
  it 's political capital and would mean vote-gain for erdogan - not worth it . 
  why would the eu do that ? 
  erdogan polls high enough to consider him `` the face and voice of the country '' . 
  especially because he 's being cheered on by so many waving the constitution away . 
  not anymore it is n't and soon wo n't be . 
  russia is also more than putin , yet it matters little since he polls very high . 
  similiar to erdogan . 
  dont worry , should you brits choose to stay cameron will get right back trying to get turkey in the eu and then complain about the eu wanting to do so . 
  billions in trade with turkey ? 
  huh ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  indeed you are and i 'm glad for it !, 
  all hail kebap !, 
  depends , if you speak the language and have a normal life i do n't see why people would not see you as a german . 
  ( as i can only speak for my nation ) on the other hand , if you refuse to learn the language , live ** only ** by the customs of your parents country and only stay within that cultural group - yeah , people might not see you as part of their culture/that country . 
  holocaust is also distorted history , right ? 
  oh and jews are behind all the bad things that happen in the middle east . 
  except it 's not bullshit but history . 
  i know , that your country has done a bad thing in its past is such a tough lesson and really hits the ego hard , but history does not change just because your feelings are hurt .
