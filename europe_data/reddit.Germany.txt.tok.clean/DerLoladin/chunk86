  so you actually believe that turkey will join the eu anytime soon ? 
  just like syria and iraq ? 
  funny that the tories were the ones pushing for turkey eu-membership ... huh ... 
   all we got ta do is take the blame for any genocide we 're ever accused of happened around 100 years back and is regarded as such by a huge numbers of countries -  `` we are accused of '' kek . 
  wow you really are disconnected to eastern european society during the cold war . 
  honestly that is kinda laughable . 
  of course she does , she is from die linke . 
  no one is doing that . 
  there is a law against insult - and in germany the law holds , against for you , me and also for erdogan . 
  do you happen to be wearing saggy pants ? 
  or perhaps a wife beater and are tattooed with gang tattoos up to your neck ? 
  oh or perhaps you like to chill with 3-4 guys who 've been arrested multiple times before ? 
  well now im fresh out of ideas ... 
  one would think people had learned what happens if you put all on an early win with russia and do n't go for the long game . 
  it can , they just do n't need those photos that badly that they are willing to pay the excessive amounts that are offered by tabloids . 
  on tabloids , big pictures sell . 
  on cnn , for example , great pictures about a us terror attack would sell . 
  see what im getting at ? 
  not every news outlet is so interested or dependent on pictures . 
  they dont need those pictures so badly for their headlines . 
  tabloids make all their money from big pictures and large-size headlines . 
  then rake in the monies . 
  money, 
  they actually want to drive their cars for a while , so unless they start buying lexus ... 
  nah most of them are leased vehicles :d, 
  pkk is obviously german ^ / s, 
  switzerland can only exist the way it is because it has allways been small . 
  my recommendation would be frontex - they have very solid charts and depictions for the refugee flow . 
  however , once i 'm home i 'll try and look into it . 
  edit : here are a number of sources that go into greater detail in regards to migrant flow . 
  [ frontex report from on all the routes ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/migratory-routes-map/ ) 2 . 
  [ a report on a reported 90 % drop on arrivals in greece ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/news/number-of-migrants-arriving-in-greece-dropped-90-in-april-6e7obw ) 3 . 
  [ the wikipedia link for 2016 , all the frontex reports are easy to find here , just follow the noted links ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis#2016 ), 
  yes , it has . 
  and hurriyet is the only one without a depiction of merkel as hitler or something similiar . 
  rules for migrant workers having nothing to do and not causing any complications for rules towards exchange students - are you serious ? 
  `` hey guys , here are the rules for this awesome program !, 
  - oh cool , i want to be part of it but do n't give a shit about the rules . 
  - well , that 's too bad . 
  our program , our rules . '', 
   look at the greece/euro crisis : for a simple reason - germany paid the most money . 
  by ** far ** the most money . 
  if the other countries are willing to accept the german plan , make a compromise and then roll with it , you can hardly blame `` strong german influence '' for that . 
  slowenia could 've paid a shit-load of money and then reason why their plan works best and make compromises with the rest of europe . 
   the redistribution rhetoric of the eu this rhetoric was brought up by the eu first , then picked up by german politicians . 
  not the other way around . 
   the refugee deal with turkey since germany took in the most refugees in comparison to all the other eu countries ( some of them flat out rejecting all refugees ) it seems reasonable that german politicians negotiate the deal that is then voted for in parlament . 
  they could allways say `` no thanks '' . 
   eu-russia relations/sanctions to a much lesser degree . 
  in comparison to the rest of europe , germany allways held good relations with the russian federation and was very reluctant to impose sanctions , much later than most other countries btw . 
  control by whom ? 
  you ? 
  he is arguing that the eu is completely aligned with german interests , in every aspect . 
  that is simply not true . 
  take the relatively recent ruling on vehicle emissions for example and what car produceres are allowed and what not . 
  you had massive resistance by car manufactures such as bmw , mercedes , vw and so on , yet , it still went through parlament . 
  how is that possible if germany hurts its own manufacturers with such a ruling ? 
  fact of the matter is , the power triangle of germany - france - britain holds the most `` power '' . 
  that is to the surprise of no one and just a given , since they are the largest economies and have allways dominated european politics . 
  but to say that the eu is aligned with germany is nuts . 
  i 'd rather say that germany is strongly aligned with the eu and their rulings and ideas . 
  then we agree , both on your point as well as the fact that `` germany is the single power in europe '' is bs . 
  otherwise , especially with the support of france , it surely would have already happened . 
  this is pretty sad to read , since it goes to show how uneducated and willfully ignorant some people are towards the existence of the eu and how it came to live . 
  people fought as to have peace on their own accord , not forced upon them by a foreign invader . 
  after ww2 that is exactly what everyone was hoping for , peace for the continent . 
  what , that makes no sense . 
  you just said they are supporting a redistribution , under the condition that they do n't have to take any more refugees . 
  yet , those plans failed . 
  how is that possible if both france and germany support it ? 
  by your logic and the logic of op , that surely would mean the redistribution should be happening this instant , since they hold all the power . 
  the vast majority does not care what happens in the eu in general , unless it has to do with taxes or a politician wants to make political capital on it . 
  those who do see a lot of potential outcomes , some of them good for the rest of us and some of them bad . 
  mentions hitler -  argument worthless . 
  so just like the uk gets their special treatment ? 
  why are the refugees not distributed then ? 
  the current government is democratically voted in . 
  last i checked iraq is still ( somewhat ) self-governing . 
  thats not a broken treaty . 
  but cool story brah, 
  so many people died for peace in europe . 
  ** peace ** go read a book or something . 
  erasmus ** will ** be affected by the uk leave , as the government plans to implement harsher laws on migrant workers . 
  switzerland was kicked out for that exact reason . 
  and quite correct . 
  gim me a broken treaty for iraq 2003 . 
  you said the qualifiers are n't robust enough , well , the eu , germany and un seem to disagree with you in terms of war . 
  so i presented you other reasons why someone might still qualify for asylum . 
  not my problem that you 're reading spiegel . 
  how about reading a proper newspaper that isnt written by autistic apes without integrity, 
  let 's dig up some more , hmm , what do we have ... oh , there is supressed religious minorities . 
  there is the active punishment of homosexuals and those of other sexual identification . 
  ( attack helicopter does ** not ** count ... this time ) there is the very real possibility of being murdered if you tweet , blog or share the wrong thing ... any better ? 
  they could certainly try . 
  then again , that 's a stupid comparison . 
  or did i miss something and there is an insurgency in aquitaine , deus vult ` ing across the landscape as well as britanny being claimed as rightful uk-clay ? 
  well then . 
  thanks for your knowledge regarding demascus . 
  aside from that , the country is a war-zone , thus refugees from syria = legit refugee status . 
  done .
