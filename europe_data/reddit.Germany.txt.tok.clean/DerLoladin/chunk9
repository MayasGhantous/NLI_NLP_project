  and as we all know , africans are also born without families and have the inherent * need * to travel to europe ... or something . 
   you are still not much worse off than working a full time job in some poor countries as someone who has spent a significant amount of time in russia ( pre-sanctions and all that ) and travelling eastern europe , with friends from all across the east and west , that is simply not true . 
  my father lived on hartz 4 for multiple years , barely scraping by . 
  it 's not a good life , especially if you also have children . 
  ( you receive a bit more money , but just enough to feed them and buy them some clothes )  that you can do odd jobs getting paid under the table for extra cash that 's hardly something that the state can do something about othern than raids on suspected employers , for which the police neither has the funding nor the manpower . 
  at least that 's what [ this graph says ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/169582/umfrage/beliebtheit-von-politikern-in-deutschland/ ) on another one the handelsblatt claimed de maiziere was only short behind sch\u00e4uble ... could n't link that , because that claim is just a bit too ridiculous for my taste . 
  read somewhere that the unhrc gives members a place so they can `` learn and better themselves '' . 
  yeah right ... 
  so while bullshit and stupid , it might explain why god damn saudi-arabia is in there . 
   the difference is that one is a german citizen , whom the german government has sworn to serve uhm , okay ? 
  makes little difference since it 's not the government who provides the welfare and benefits , but the state . 
  state = / = government . 
   why not go even further with your relativism and just give everyone on earth the same treatment as a hartz 4 recipient ? 
  that does n't even make any sense , how many times do i have to explain the `` status '' that certain people are granted due to coming from a warzone . 
  for fucks sake . 
   all you have to do is literally walk in and ask for asylum . 
  alright , you 're actually retarded . 
  learn to read , but i will reiterate for you - you are ** not ** granted ** any ** benefits aside from basic things like food , shelter and a place to sleep ** until ** you are processed . 
   you receive benefits after you 've been given a rejection no , you do n't . 
   please , give me the quote and source that says you have to take in people from across half the globe who do n't even have any identification . 
  [ knock ] ( http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/handbook-law-asylum-migration-borders-2nded_en.pdf ) [ yourself ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html ) [ out ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_16a.html ), 
   and to think that he 's rumoured to be next in line for chancellor . 
  oh please , you do n't actually believe that , right ? 
  without aiming to insult anyone , but he * is * an edgy cripple who is hated by a good chunk of the eu members . 
  fuckin ' * great * conditions . 
  haha shit that 's funny suppose the enforcement is just different . 
  it 's here in germany also not enforced by the state , rather by private companies who `` ping '' certain torrents and thus figure you out . 
  it 's super shady and is unlikely to hold up in court , if i remember my lawyer correctly , but considering that just paying the 900 $ is cheaper than being dragged into court ... 
  your question has no merit though , as it was never implied by my . 
  the turkish government has every right to their actions , just like any other nations government . 
   do you want to undermine sovereign nations elections and its goverment legality ? 
  weird , then how can people in this thread claim `` europeans do n't want these people '' or `` our politicians only want them ! '', 
  afterall , thats what they voted for did n't they, 
  it 's quite literally the legitimization of the matter . 
  so unless you know of a way how to make turkey * not * send over the refugees ( at times by force ) you might as well accept the fact . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/eu-turkey-refugee-deal-qa ) [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation#partial_suspension_of_the_regulation_during_2015_european_refugee_and_migrant_crisis ), 
   yes , but people who are a burden on the state ( meaning they 've received welfare in the past 5 years ) can not become citizens . 
  since i can only apply this to germany -  similiar rules , however those who want to stay will have found work as soon as possible anyways . 
  trust me , sitting around doing nothing all day while also living off of very little money is not a particularly good time . 
   they 've arrived to europe without a visa , therefore they 're illegals . 
  completely and utterly false . 
  as soon as they say they are refugees/claim asylum the illegal immigrant status is dropped . 
  so no , they are n't . 
  they get that status back once their request has been denied or they are ordered to return to their country . 
   most of which were economic immigrants who slowly leech of the european society to this very day . 
  agreed , especially because most of them came from the balkans . 
  torrenting is still illegal in austria and even in germany you are not `` basically fucked '' . 
  did receive a letter once about a movie claiming over 900 $ in compensation ... so i called up my lawyer , he set up a letter and i have never heard of them since . 
  since the dublin regulation was suspended by certain countries ( to take the weight off of greece and italy ) there are now deals in place that will transfer them to those countries . 
   are n't you exaggerating a bit here ? 
  he is n't . 
  from my experience and those around me , once you begin to watch your tv shows and movies in english , it 's really difficult to watch movies in german . 
  you can actually ** see ** that they are saying the wrong words , so the whole thing just feels fake as hell . 
  internet is probably the worst , the copyright is the exact same as in most places of the western world . 
  romania just does n't care and lets people pirate stuff all they want ... 
   kosovo , sudan , lebanon , mali , senegal , somalia or northern iraq ? 
  the un and eu . 
  germany can not deploy any troops outside its own border without legitimizing it through a third party organization . 
  meaning right now either the un , eu or nato . 
   who have already worked get harz4 yup . 
  last time i checked they also were n't refugees from an international recognised warzone . 
  but hey !, 
  if you 're unhappy about that , you can always give up german citizenship , travel to syria , apply for syrian citizenship , travel into one of the conflict areas , stay there for a while and * then * travel back to europe in a boat . 
  you might die but oh well . 
   you give people free money for just walking in and kinda being refugees . 
  man , people always seem to lose the ability to read on that part , weird ...  they get at least some free money or other stuff which is simply not fair to the people who are paying for this i 'm paying for it and i do n't have an issue paying for our international and european obligations which germany signed . 
  you know , it 's part of not being a shitty third-world country . 
   the other people who are not so well off . 
  refugees are suddenly `` well off '' ? 
  holy . 
  shit . 
  do i have to remind you that every eu citizen can come to germany , apply for a job and just begin to * work * ? 
  does n't even matter where you 're from !, 
  polish ? 
  no problem !, 
  czech ? 
  do n't worry about it !, 
  estonian , romanian , british , french , latvian ... it does n't matter !, 
  so you want the turkish government to go against the will of their people ** yet ** you want the european governments to follow the will of some populist numbnuts ? 
  interesting view , very interesting . 
  the australian solution could allways be done in a better fashion . 
  then again , best solution would still be un camps in neighbouring nations . 
  not quite sure what your point is ? 
  your chart also very nicely goes to show what i already explained , germany is cheaper than most of western europe , but more expensive than eastern europe . 
   ca n't you restrict the welfare to eu/eea citizens ? 
  they are actually going to receive less , to limit welfare tourism from within the eu . 
  ( well , only less if they do n't work . 
  for which you do n't need a permit ) it would also mean that the state could just go ahead and say `` yup , we 're gon na pay for your rent ... but nothing else . 
  not our problem how you scrape by and eat . '', 
   what a disaster . 
  everyone has a right to apply for citizenship . 
  does n't matter if you are american , european , russian , chinese , phillipene , argentinian or syrian . 
  that goes for your country as well , most likely . 
   nope , they 've entered the eu without a visa . 
  they are therefore illegals . 
  you do know what the right of asylum and the refugee charter are ? 
  they hardly need a visa ...  we 'd better start taking border protection seriously . 
  [ frontex ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/ )  also , is n't their world supposedly on fire ? 
  why should n't they be happy to stay in safety until the wars are over ? 
  believe it or not , but even syria enjoyed a certain standart of living .
