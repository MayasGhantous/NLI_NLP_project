honestly i thought it would be the other way round , because of post-ww2 dispossessions and resettlement to ( west ) germany . 
   well it means `` is peeing '' in silesian sounds very familiar to the ( rarely used , as far as i 'm concerned ) `` pullern '' in german . 
  wow , it even has it 's own [ wiktionary page ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pullern ) :d, 
  sounds like the mexican virus joke from the early 2000s , turned into this : `` dear terrorists , since we ca n't find you we kindly ask you to visit one of the police stations in your area and turn yourself in . 
  thanks in advance for your cooperation ! '', 
  correct , the swedish platypuses from paradox interactive . 
   once it rises above the death toll of right wing crazy idiots , we might consider doing something . 
  we 'll see how that goes . 
  the nsu investigations and trial ( [ rightist terror cell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nsu_trial ) ; not the [ car manufacturer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nsu_motorenwerke ) ) are n't exactly a stern example of how to investigate those crimes . 
  one could even say the opposite is the case with the [ bfv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_office_for_the_protection_of_the_constitution ) ordering the destruction of related files back in 2012 ... 
  bad time to attempt to sack greece if you ask me . 
  but ca n't into space . 
  * greetings from / r/eu4  *, 
  you 're looking kinda chill for someone having an armed chinese guy in weird clothes on your back . 
  pinnacle of german entertainment :p reminds me of their 1945 image of destroyed cologne , titled `` great !, 
  the new subway is finished '' after the town archive building collapsed - nearby subway construction side kinda `` undermined '' the foundation of that building iirc . 
  username checks out , i guess ? 
  consider yourself warned :p, 
  at least the chances are increasing . 
  `` chances without being sentenced to eternal damnation '' , that is . 
   with regard to your side note . 
  i 'd rather host some nukes than a couple of trump golf courses . 
  trump is n't likely to visit nukes but there 's a very real danger that he 'll visit his golf courses . 
  so think of it as not so much paying to keep nukes but paying to keep trump away . 
  interesting view . 
  i like the gold course idea though . 
  shitting right into the holes ( not on the greens , into the holes ) would make for a nice statement i guess . 
  part of the nato policy commonly known as [ nuclear sharing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_sharing ) , so i guess we have to blame - at least in parts - ourselves in this aswell . 
  when i can spare some time i 'll do . 
  right now i still in shock about what is on the horizon in the west . 
  i 'm really concerned about the us presidential elections this run , and for the first time = / on a side note trump just uttered germany shall pay for the nuclear weapons stored on us bases in our country . 
  like we actually would want to have them here in the first place \\* facepalm *, 
  i always thought the hairstyle was quite silly . 
  seems as if the rest underneath is n't any better . 
  your garage will be full and empty at the same time , until you have a look . 
  not long i swear and i will switch on prime time news to see the camera lock-on to the host , who goes : `` good evening to the tagesschau . 
  breaking news : everyone went nuts . 
  and now the weather forecast for the next days ... '' fake smile , transition to weather forecast , evening program , done . 
   germany has mass surveillance of the own population and others , industrial espionage and is a economic and politically bully in europe . 
  which is shit as it is , but i 'm glad we do n't it to the extent the us is engaging in stuff like that , let even have the means to do so ( a german echelon would wreck public finances ... ) . 
  concerning surveilance : we - germany and the us - are on the same team on that crap , assisting in prism with the famed `` selector lists '' and what not . 
  and that 's to `` prevent terrorism '' ( and really working great / s ) . 
  but remember the uproar in western media when china started their relentless mass surveilance shit ? 
  `` that 's opressing the opposition , hindering democracy ... yadda yadda yadda . '', 
  did i hear `` double standards '' ? 
  of course not , at least not from western media . 
  ( there 's actually an interesting ongoing discussion about what is perceived by many german citizens as a fairly one-sided media coverage of recent nato-russian tensions lately btw . ), 
   and you want to go back to the 50 's , do you really want to play that game ? 
  did n't say anything about going back to the 1950s . 
  i pitched that decade as a starting point when us foreign politics really went nuts on a global scale ( thinking of the dulles twins for example ) . 
  to cut a long story short : i would have wished for humanity to be smarter than starting this whole geopolitcal bullshit all over when in ended in desaster twice before . 
  and a good time for starting to act smarter would have been in the 1950s . 
  the us . 
  if germany were to act like that ( which does not seem to be the case as of now ) i would n't feel any different , btw . 
  `` hate '' is strong word . 
  it 's more of a strong disliking of the `` we are team world police , and when we do x it 's ok - but god forbid anyone else dare to it '' mentality they are following since the 1950s . 
  replace x with any of those - covert ops - regime change - influencing public opinion via ngos - mass surveilance of the own population - industrial espionage ( on friends and foes alike ) . 
  and the list goes on . 
  came here to say it . 
  since media sure wo n't . 
  not quite anime , but 2d tv had bits about stupid terrorist , e.g. 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncheows17c4 ) or this [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9tbrm8xbpa&amp;t=941 ) . 
  since 1845 !, 
  watch your words , that 's my brother !, 
  whatever floats your boat , mate . 
  just make sure it 's consensual . 
  can confirm , the castle is beautiful . 
  has a good restaurant / cafe in it aswell . 
  would definitely help avoiding stuff like `` that was a disgusting act of terrorism \\ #niceattack '' on twitter . 
  i 'm always thinking `` is he/she secretely applauding the attacker ? '', 
  still rather confused when reading about `` nice terrorists '' . 
  that chance just passed . 
  michael bay gifs is leaking ? 
  i think he 's referring to the fact that mostly those madmen are stopped by police and the like , rather than by civilians armed for self defence . 
  hahahaha , nice satire ... at least i hope so . 
  that 's obvious : `` toilet paper '', 
  i guess that leaves you with two option : either get in touch with them and tell them of your concerns , trying to influence their future work , or start your own , avoiding the pitfalls you mentioned in the process . 
  no , but a watchblog sure helps document the ongoing press nightmare . 
  spot on . 
  allmost all there is to be said about this so called `` newspaper '' . 
  for the rest see www.bildblog.de, 
  i ca n't help but feel like you came here with the `` i did not click the link '' express from i-do-not-get-the-reference-town . 
  based on a lack of alternatives i suppose . 
  maybe `` nothing going on here , but it 's still has super beautfiul nature-island '' , but that is clunky as hell . 
  catch him , he 's super rare !, 
  so we are basically the blorg of europe . 
  `` you will be befriended .

  oh , i love this `` parrot '' . 
  his brexit bit on last week tonight was great . 
  still laughing from thinking of that kid in the union jack vest and his song . 
  in the news right now aswell : `` uk soccer team strips itself of status as aaa class team '' once more congratulations to iceland :p,
