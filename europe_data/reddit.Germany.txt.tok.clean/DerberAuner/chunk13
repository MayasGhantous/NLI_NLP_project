  but thanks for clarifying . 
  i am now certain , that you , too , have no idea if they were actually refugees . 
  you just recognized the general region they were originally from . 
  a shame . 
  alright , that makes it clear why theres no charges being pressed . 
  in that kind of situation , hes fearing for his life . 
  no doubt about it , this is one of the clearest cases of self-defense you can come across . 
  and you told that to the police ? 
  out of curiousity : i dont suppose you can/could assess the nationalities specifically , can/could you ? 
  im asking cause im trying to get a bit of a clearer picture here . 
  someone speaking a foreign language might well be a long-standing resident of germany ( you just have to look at some turks to realize , that many people dont integrate well into germany ) , despite looking like a refugee or sth . 
  im trying to assess if you could actually discern these two groups , cause if not , were as far as we were before , in that we know that these were people with `` migrational background '' , not neccessarily refugees . 
  : s though the timing , of course , does not bode well ... 
  im german on the internet . 
  how would that be different from any other day ? 
  if i piss someone off im a nazi , if i correct someones grammar im a nazi , if i tell people `` exterminate the jews '' im a nazi ... where does it end ? 
  ^ ( this is a joke ; please dont take it seriously ), 
  was on the tip of my tongue  i was trying to bridge the gap between `` youre not neccessarily reacting to something '' and at the same time saying what i meant , which led me to the scientific term `` excitation '' ( `` erregung '' in german , which i think is an apt translation of `` hevige gemoeds ** beweging ** '' ) idk . 
  interesting in any case , and thanks for sharing . 
  cheerio , 
  id say in german that would be `` heftige gem\u00fctsbewegung '' ( literally ; not ideomatically ) ? 
  sooo `` strong excitement '' or `` strong emotional excitation '' ? 
  something like that ? 
   not sure how to translate use the dutch term . 
  dutch is kind of german , right ? 
  ( seriously , use the dutch term , im curious , and almost certain theres a german term thats similar )  you can surely plead for one of those if you get attacked or someone you loves get attacked . 
  you can , i would think . 
  `` verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit der mittel '' ( reasonable force ) takes into account what ** you ** deem reasonable , according to the situation you are in , and according to what ** you ** percieved . 
  if you feel threatened for your life , then use of deadly force may well be legal in germany . 
  that said , there has to be reasonable reason for you to feel threatened in that fashion . 
  an old man living alone or with his wife would certainly fit in this category . 
   for nothing you idiot it she adverbial adjuncts explaining why the subject of the sentence ( i ) has the predicate ( shitty looks ) happening for it referring to it 's actions . 
  `` i get shitty looks for nothing '' , not `` i get shitty looks even though nothing happened . '', 
  i understood what you wrote . 
  im just trying to tell you that youre looking at it from your own perspective alone . 
  the outside perspective is not the same . 
   seriously trying being the swcirceljerk somewhere else brother , im so far from sjjjjjjw , you have no fucking clue . 
  dont compare me to those mental defectives . 
   no one denied that what happend was wrong . 
  no one excused the acts that happend . 
  no argument here . 
  i think i said that before , didnt i ? 
   but that would be just boring to actually understand the context right ? 
  im trying to tell you that for other people ( like myself ) , this is not `` nothing '' . 
  and since you still dont seem to get it , let me be blunt : you being black , or arab or whatever now is not `` nothing '' to them . 
  because now they always have the context of this incident in mind , so theyre trying to protect themselves , by keeping their distance from people who are part of a group of people ( black/arab people ) who instigated this incident . 
  still think im sjjjjw ? 
  -- apparently `` sjjjjjjjjjjw '' ( with one `` j '' ) is banned here . 
  so my earlier comment was removed . 
  and i was worried about the word reeeeeeetard ... 
  interesting if true . 
  do you have an article handy ? 
  i thought it was more complicated than that . 
  many , but not all . 
  in fact , most of my friends and relatives didnt have days off . 
  though with january 6th around the corner , it is reasonable to assume that quite a few people used four days of vacation to have a week off . 
   i did nothing . 
  agreed . 
  but its not like this happens to you `` for nothing '' . 
  people are fucking worried , cause this sort of thing hasnt happened before . 
  for reference , this is what you wrote :  i get shitty looks for nothing now . 
  --  are you even serious right now . 
  about 50 % . 
   i do n't even live on those cities . 
  either you ca n't read or you are really stupid . 
  nah , i can do both . 
  but theres a difference between something being `` for nothing '' , i.e. 
  there not being a reason at all , and something happening to you despite you not having done anything wrong , i.e. 
  you getting blamed/suspected for the actions of others , e.g. 
  simply because you share a certain phenotype . 
  it was just a suggestion , though . 
  dont take it so seriously . 
   i never denied that . 
  never said that you did . 
  what i meant by that is that inherently `` for nothing '' implies that `` nothing happened '' . 
  id be fine with the expression , if youd be a victim of some sort of moral outrage or some shit like that , which essentially is nothing , but were talking about real crimes that happened to real people here . 
  this is not nothing . 
   i said it is bad for me as well being of my skin color . 
  agreed . 
  and im sorry about that . 
  i truely am . 
  believe it or not . 
  one of my core thoughts in all of this is `` what can effectively be done , that , while solving/mitigating this issue in the future , at the same time does not adversely affect innocent bystanders ? '', 
  and the only response to that that i can come up with is increased police presence . 
  which in itself is fucking depressing , seeing as germany is in essence such a safe nation . 
  or `` was '' , up until ~ a few days ago . 
   so do us a favor and read before you comment . 
  i did read . 
  you didnt think throug hwhat precisely it is you wrote . 
  `` 90 alleged cases that range from theft to rape '' is not `` nothing '' . 
  oh for fucks sake germany ... 
  i wouldnt say `` for nothing '' ... i would say `` despite not having done anything wrong '' . 
  would you be alright with that ? 
  cause at the end of the day , this is one of the worst incidents of a similar kind in germany , that i can remember . 
  id hardly call it nothing ... especially not for the victims . 
  because it took time for all the reports to come in and be filed . 
  at least i hope thats what it is . 
  the alternative is that there was a delay in order to make sure the story is `` presented the right way '' . 
  : s id hate for us to go down that route ... again ... 
   you have a huge crowd of almost exclusively refugess ( i was there , i saw it ) and that 's where all the raping , groping and robbing happens .
