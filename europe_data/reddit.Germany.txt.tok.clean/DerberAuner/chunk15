  where ? 
   and those are not unemployed because they are employed as you said yeah well , they might as well be unemployed , since they cant sustain themselves despite a job . 
  a job that you cant live off of is not a job . 
  get real mate . 
  sais nothing about the methodology . 
  sorry , but unless you directly link me to the methodology used im not going to accept this . 
  cause the agency is cheating when creating its own statistic . 
  it counts people who are `` looking for work '' not as unemployed , since theyre `` looking for work '' . 
  it counts people in `` arbeitsschaffende massnahmen '' not as unemployed , etc. 
  unless i can see exactly how its all measured and how the data is gathered , im not going to accept a statistic . 
  there are just too many ways to fuck around with them . 
  and im not even talking about people who get unemployment benefits despite working , cause their work just doesnt pay enough ( yes , we have those in germany as well ) . 
  wheres yours ? 
  you made the original claim man , and if youre gon na cite a statistic , i wan na see methodology , and compare it to methodology from previous statistics . 
  but suffice it to say for now , that i know people who work/used to work for the unemployment office , and know how these stats are made . 
  unemployment is actually worse . 
  the numbers are just hidden better . 
   in general i would say that a very big part of germans is actually quite content with how the government is doing its job and a lot more than the other european countries seem to be with their governments . 
  yeah , but thats also cause most germans dont want to `` rock the boat '' too much . 
  not to mention the fact that we have very little to write home about in terms of bad government . 
  most things are running fine . 
  better than in the rest of the union , i would argue . 
  well see if that changes in the coming years , but i honestly dont expect it to . 
  im not an expert , but to me this read like sarcasm . 
   wait what ? 
  fission products are well documented , as are nuclear decay product . 
  ok , then why dont you list to me which fission products will occur after a fission reaction of lets say 1 kg uranium in which quantity . 
  should be easy enough if it actually * is * that well documented , right ? 
  i mean , its not like fission products in turn could absorb neutrons from further fission reactions , right ? 
  -- at this point im just gon na stop . 
  theres so much `` if '' and `` once '' attached to this im going to make this clear for you once and for all : nuclear waste is a problem that isnt solved , and that wont be solved within the next century . 
  and you cant just `` store this stuff for a century '' and then use your ( theoretical ) new technologies to further process it , cause nuclear waste will eat through almost anything within that timeframe . 
  i really think you havent thought this through . 
  and the whole `` space elevator '' stuff really makes it pretty clear you are one of those futurology nuts . 
  im going to give you a piece of advice that might prove useful in the future : stop living in `` if-land '' . 
   by that reasonning we should just stick to coal since a few decade ago solar panel and windturbine were also not economically viable this one for last , cause again its one of the more ridiculous comments . 
  the advantages of solar and wind were pretty commonly known , while it was also known that there were no expected sideeffects like ... i dont know ... *** nuclear waste *** , that still had to be solved . 
  its the difference between `` i can reap a lot of benefit potentially '' and `` i can reap a lot of benefit potentially , ** if ** i can solve this huge problem that still isnt solved more than 50 years after the technology was developed originally , and will ( if i dont solve it ) haunt people living thousands of years after im dead . '', 
  are you getting it yet , or do i have to take out some sort of sky writing advertisement near you ? 
  nuclear waste is a huge problem that cant just be `` put off until we solve it '' . 
  its simply not that kind of problem , end of story . 
  pretending otherwise is nothing short of delusional at this point . 
  if they ever solve this issue , we can talk again about nuclear reactors , but until then i dont want those things anywhere . 
  and no , `` digging a really deep hole '' is not a solution . 
  ive heard this soooo often , but it ignores the simple fact that youre still leaving nuclear waste around for thousands if not millions of years , not to mention the fact that the chain reactions that occur with that waste are nigh-on unpredictable on that timescale , simply cause the actual fission products are nigh on unpredictable . 
   and that 's the worst case scenario , best case we 'll just use the waste as fuel for new rapid neutron powerplant yes , i wonder why we dont have these magic powerplants ? 
  could it be cause these plants could actually be used to make weaponsgrade uranium/plutonium and the political shitstorm attached to those is unimaginable ? 
  or was that the one that simply isnt economically viable ? 
  face it , if it actually * were * that easy , it would have been done already . 
  i know reddit has a hard-on for nuclear power , but come the fuck on ... at least do your research properly . 
   then we could just dump the waste in space ( throw it into the sun to be sure it wo n't come back ) . 
  ok , i had to put this one underneath cause its just fucking ridiculous . 
  do you know what this would cost , if you used uranium as a large scale powersource ? 
  or are you some futurology nut who thinks `` surely spacetravel will cost less in the [ near ] future '' ? 
  nothing emotional about it mate . 
  rationally speaking , we have no place to put the garbage/nuclear waste . 
  which changes the perspective on how safe it actually is . 
  ill grant you that co2 is the more imminent problem , but in the long run you cant just ignore the nuclear waste problem . 
  depends largely on the actual percentage and when the spikes happen in relation to when the demand spikes happen . 
  to my knowledge , currently theyre using water pump reservoirs as storage cause theres simply nothing more efficient right now on the neccessary scale , which admittedly is a big problem . 
  but its not like fission is much better ; and fusion is still 50 years away at best . 
  not much choice there imo ... 
  tbh , what turned it around for me was the episode on france that stephen fry did on qi . 
  apparently french soldiers are historically the most successful/best ones . 
  that said , up * until * that point i saw it for what it was : a joke . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  i think its both , actually . 
  hillarious * and * stupid . 
  sounds like a great sense of humour to me , tbh . 
  stupid , but a great sense of humour . 
   oh my , that condescending tone . 
  yeah , cause yours was better . 
   the lack of any constraint is one definition of freedom [ im getting sick of this ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberty#politics ) `` to be free , to the greeks , was to not have a master , to be independent from a master ( to live like one likes ) '' [ if you go by this ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/freedom ) , the most common one is basically what i said , since nothing here has any restrictions placed upon it . 
  this one stands out : `` philosophy . 
  the power to exercise choice and make decisions without constraint from within or without ; autonomy ; self-determination . '', 
  [ liberty ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/liberty?s=t ) isnt very different here . 
  sorry mate , but you really dont have a ground to stand on in this . 
   it does n't matter where the line is exactly yes it does . 
  cause the statement franklin made was boolean in nature . 
  `` if youre beyond the line , you are beyond hope '' . 
  if it had more nuance , we could dicuss this point . 
  but it doesnt have nuance . 
  it sais `` either youre for freedom , or youre against it '' . 
  that means you need to know exactly where you draw the line . 
  cause frankly , i dont think im against freedom/liberty , but i bet that by american definition , i actually would be . 
  most certainly by franklins if other people in this thread are to be believed . 
  --  the important thing is to maintain a reasonable equilibrium . 
  the european and us views on free speech are both reasonable . 
  alright , let me make this clear : im discussing this quote , which has the very specific context of an absolute statement . 
  in general i agree , both forms of freedom are acceptable , so long as they are reasonable ( which imo they are ) . 
  that said : thats not whats in ben franklins quote . 
  in there it sais in essence `` if youre not for absolute liberty , youre not for liberty at all '' . 
  and that makes it a shit quote to ever use in the context of liberty . 
  what about your right to say insulting words ? 
  does it end when it might be heard by other people ? 
  what about the right to say untruthful things ? 
  does it end when it can harm others ? 
  what about your right to believe what you want ? 
  does it end where you might inspire someone to genocide ? 
  or sooner ?
