  dont pretend like this is some easy cut-and-dry issue . 
  its not . 
  to be clear though : im not saying israel is the definite villain here , either . 
  its more nuanced than that . 
   you comment is a fallacy : you 're defining `` freedom '' in a self-destructive way so you can conclude that it has to be restricted . 
  no , im defining freedom exactly the way its defined . 
  in that you are free to do whatever you want . 
  even in my definition , freedom itself isnt self-destructive . 
  freedom only is destructive ( not ** self ** - destructive ) in combination with multiple people being around . 
  which is a natural state , i. e. freedom is destructive by nature . 
  youre putting a lot of restrictions onto freedom , just to make in a `` good thing '' , which is utterly ridiculous . 
  its almost as bad as when people call something they dont like `` unamerican '' , as though `` american '' were synonymous with everything thats good . 
  freedom means the ability to do and/or say whatever you want . 
  that is by nature destructive . 
  only when you put restrictions onto said freedom , e.g. 
  by saying `` you are not allowed to do/say x '' , it becomes a valuable commodity . 
  in its pure form , you end up with an animalistic state of being . 
   the self-coherent definition of liberty is `` being able to do anything that does n't impede on the rights of others '' and where do you draw that line , huh ? 
  thats something i * hate * when people make this sort of argument . 
  they usually cant even define what `` rights '' are , let alone * basic * rights , or for that matter rights that infringe upon others . 
  every society draws that line at a different place , which should tell you just how spongy of a concept what youre saying here is . 
  it is by no means as cut-and-dry as you make it out to be . 
  example : i have ( by nature ) the ability to kill others . 
  so does every other human . 
  i also have a ability by nature to kill anything i see . 
  take anything i want , fuck anything / - one i want . 
  but do i have the right to `` not be killed '' ? 
  by nature , i have to say noone has that right . 
  because by nature , rights dont exist . 
  they are human constructs . 
  rights only have meaning if theres someone there to enforce them . 
  cause otherwise , what does your precious right to `` not be killed '' mean ? 
  someone might just come along and kill you anyway . 
  rights are human constructs . 
  if you dont define what the rights are that people have , the statement is once again spongy as fuck , and can be interpreted as the ravings of a madman , depending on the position . 
   that 's the principle of liberty that must not be sacrificed for `` security '' . 
  well , i got bad news for you , every society on the whole goddamned planet already does that to some degree . 
  let me give you an example of what i mean : germany : you have no right to insult someone , cause it infringes on the rights of others to * not be insulted * . 
  im not making this up , the law exists and is being enforced . 
  now , by americas definition , thats not freedom , cause in america you have the right to say whatever the fuck you want , so long as you actually believe it ( something you honestly believe can by definition not be slander in the us ) . 
  but by german definition it is , cause people have a right `` not to be insulted '' . 
  are you starting to see the problem , or do i have to dumb it down even more ? 
  even the definition of liberty you gave is spongy as fuck , cause the definition of `` rights '' is not incapsulated in it . 
  and thats what makes this quote a shit quote . 
  it oversimplifies an issue that should not be reduced to this degree . 
  end of story . 
  you really havent thought this through at all , have you ? 
  oh thats great , so slander would be fine , then ? 
  face it , no matter how you twist and turn it , so long as theres human interaction , there need to be limits on freedom . 
  maaan , thats a far fetched argument thats incredibly difficult to prove or disprove . 
  if the causal chain is weak to begin with you cant just go ahead and claim `` we prevented terrorattacks '' . 
  to clarify : by `` the causal chain '' , i mean the likelyhood that someone leaving the country as you described will eventually cause a terrorattack . 
  all indications are that there isnt a strong causal link . 
  look , ultimately , id guess the amount of terrorattacks you prevent like this is disproportional to the amount of privacy you sacrifice for this miniscule gained safety ... 
  hate to break this to you , dude : but this isnt about the core values of the religion . 
  cause believe it or not , brutality is part of the bible , too . 
  gods a pretty vengeful fucker in the old testament . 
  if they didnt do it for islam , theyd find something else to do it for . 
  like fucking cthulu , or some sort of norse religion or sth . 
  and even if you eradicated all faith , theyd still be doing it . 
  islam has nothing to do with this , beyond that it was the first adress these people went to . 
  its an excuse for them , nothing more . 
  eif you kill the religions , they might eventually run out of excuses for why theyre doing it , or they might simply invent a new one . 
  the religion is a pretext . 
  nothing more . 
  its the people underneath , and the respective situations theyre in that are the core issue of terrorism . 
  it always is . 
  you think terrorism is new ? 
  let me remind you of idealists called the `` red army faction '' . 
  or maybe you prefer the `` irish republican army '' ? 
  you think terrorism comes from religion ? 
  grow the fuck up . 
  it originates with malcontents who blame the state of society or the world for their own personal situation . 
  and like it or not , in some cases these people are actually right to blame said state . 
  and just so were fucking clear here : im not condoning anything they did . 
  im telling you why theyre doing it , and im telling you that it achieves the goal they want to achieve . 
  frankly , im doubtful well ever solve this problem , cause its roots are in discontent . 
  and `` killing the islamic state '' certainly wont solve the issue , either . 
  itll only create martyrs , whom the next incarnation of the same idea will follow . 
  social values have little to do with it . 
  if you think society is stacked against you , why should you care about social values ? 
  why would you seek a `` fair '' fight ? 
  why would you move according to human decency , when savagery is soooo much more effective ? 
  sure , at the lowest of the low , you might actually find some religious fanatics . 
  but i doubt you will ** ever ** get rid of those ... even christianity still has those . 
   jews , because of their minority status , have rarely committed acts of violence . 
  hmmm ... how does modern israel fit in with this statement ? 
  the problem isnt islam . 
  islam was creating better societies than christianity was back in the middle ages . 
  the problem is that you have people who have zero perspective , nothing to look forward to , while in the west you have excess and people living in relative luxuary . 
  its a problem with poverty , education , and worldwide injustice . 
  you can temporarily shut it down , but you wont be able to solve this easily by dealing with dictators and shit . 
  that part is only a symptom . 
  thats my take on it anyway . 
  wasnt there a statement by the american mass survailance programs head , saying they prevented no terrorattacks ? 
  never liked that ben franklin statement . 
  `` freedom above all '' is a naive position , that breaks down if you actually try to enforce it . 
  simple example : absolute freedom would mean you could do whatever you want whenever you want . 
  it would mean you could kill people at will . 
  and thats simply anarchy .
