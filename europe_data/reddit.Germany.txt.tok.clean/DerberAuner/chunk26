  wouldnt `` lowering the standards '' simply mean that well be breathing toxic/harmful air ? 
  arent those regulations there for a reason ? 
  to be fair , christianity is the most dominant religion in germany by a wide margin . 
  and if you dont pay church tax , you wont be counted as catholic, 
   this is physics no its not . 
  its sociology/psychology id think . 
  source : am physicist . 
   in my view the `` left '' today are not rational , all they care about is their personal political agenda , but its the immigrants who will be paying the price in the future . 
  honestly , i dont see the agenda . 
  i see naivity , i see people turning blind eyes , i see desperation ( especially in germany ) . 
  but i dont quite see `` the agenda '' . 
  would you mind elaborating on what you think the agenda is ? 
  sounds reasonable in principle . 
   we 're not fascists , we 're sane . 
  in my experience people in large groups , especially when under the influence of fear , do not always act rationally/sane . 
  im not saying the worst case scenario will neccessarily happen , but as the old saying goes `` vigilia pretium libertatis '', 
  i use res . 
  for some reason i couldnt watch the vid , and only saw the title . 
  sooo ... no . 
  but now i did :d . 
  why the fuck did i click on that - . - ' ? 
  i shouldve known it would be the hoff . 
  ive actually heard this before . 
  its always a question of measurement , but in sciences and math , i actually believe that the east may have the advantage . 
  do you pay church tax ? 
   i do hold to the view that there is some kind of unchanging truth available to man . 
  and thats the crux ( again ) . 
  to some people , the unchanging truth lies in christianity , or in islam , or in hinduism , or where-the-fuck-ever . 
  to these people * we * are the indoctrinated ones . 
   the idea of something being ` true ' or ` false ' can also be concluded , to an extent , through logical reasoning . 
  ah , but in religion , `` the word of god as written down by man '' is above even logical reasoning . 
  which is why if you get right down to it , religion is truely fucked up . 
   however , when you look at education rates , then you see that the more educated people are the more likely they are to lean to a liberal/western view point . 
  see , this is already what im talking about . 
  you might not think it , but this * already is * a value judgement , namely that `` education is better '' . 
  its only implied , but its there . 
  i know this sounds fucked up , but there it is . 
  to some people , education is bad , especially if it contradicts certain teachings , because these teachings are seen as sacrosanct , and above all else . 
  thats * your * view as a westerner . 
  eastern perspective may be quite different . 
  * if * youre claiming youre right , youre automatically claiming as well , that western values are the * better * values . 
  and while i happen to think this is true , at least when they are contrasted with islamic values , both you and i are biased in our assessment of the situation . 
  in fact theres noone whos completely unbiased here . 
  this isnt quite as easy as people are always making this out to be . 
  on a philosophical level , when trying to be as objective as possible , you are already making a value judgement about what are `` good '' values . 
  thats whats causing most of these culture clashes . 
  thats why i think this immigration thing will be a giant clusterfuck . 
  lets be real here , its not just muslims that dont do that . 
  people from the west emigrating into the east also largely maintain their own culture . 
  this is just a human thing . 
  the question is if something can be done about it , and if not , if it will negatively impact society to such a degree that its no longer acceptable . 
  got ta admit , this does have a certain appeal ... 
  ... outside the context of the translation , sure . 
  well ... what else would i be talking about ? 
  it started out with me bitching about the translation , afterall . 
  nope , youre not getting it . 
  in german youre right `` staatsgewalt '' is usually not used in this sense , however in english , `` force '' implies the use of stately force . 
  that means , if the german text implies the use of `` stately force '' ( as it does here ) , you have to translate it with `` force '' , not `` violence '' . 
  thats the point here . 
  the force being exercised is state-sanctioned , therefore `` force '' , not `` violence '' . 
  violence implies a certain britality or absent of `` order '' for lack of a better term that is not given in this specific situation . 
  * sigh * . 
  `` gewalt '' , when exercised by a stately organ as allowed by law is * always * `` staatsgewalt '' . 
  you dont say it in german , but this is what is meant here . 
  therefore , the correct translation has to be `` force '' , not `` violence '' . 
  its more the english definition thats the problem here i think . 
  `` violence '' has a different connotation , and wouldnt be used in this situation . 
  as i said elsewhere , `` force '' is more commonly used when the state threatens to use violence . 
  violence seems more on a non-legal/non-approved basis . 
  `` staatsgewalt '' is almost always `` force '' , and in this context `` gewalt '' is short for `` staatsgewalt '' metaphorically speaking . 
  based on the context it can only be `` force '' . 
  ah , so the same as me , 
   definitionen von force  substantiv  strength or energy as an attribute of physical action or movement . 
  he was thrown backward by the force of the explosion  synonyme : strength , power , energy , might , effort , exertion , impact , pressure , weight , impetus  coercion or compulsion , especially with the use or threat of violence . 
   `` they ruled by law and not by force '' source : google translate i think force is more apt . 
  i didnt assume malice . 
  its just a question of nuance , and `` violence '' is a tad bit harsher than `` force '' , which would be more accurate . 
  `` violence '' implies actual acts of violence , like say a riot , whereas `` force '' implies the use of state-approved methods of well ... force ... which as a rule are more controlled and less lethal , unless explecitly called `` lethal force '' . 
  its just the linguist in me . 
  force is when its done legitimately by the state , violence is when theres no legal basis ( i think ) . 
  the only thing i think that can be adressing this is to keep the nuance alive . 
  to remind people continuously that it doesnt have to be binary , but rather that there is a spectrum of opinions . 
  just cause i got ta ask and im curious by nature : why `` sevenvolts '' ? 
  `` gewalt '' means literally `` force '' in this case . 
  as in `` well keep these people out of the country , with force if need be '' . 
  just a little pointer here : `` gewalt '' in this context means `` force '' , not `` violence '' . 
  yeah , i dont know what that is all about . 
  all this binary thinking that seems to be going on in the us . 
  it seems to infect everything within us culture . 
  from the politics to the tv shows and even the movies . 
  the destruction of nuance is a terrible thing , and i honestly hope europe isnt moving towards that . 
  fair enough . 
  im not a regular on the sub tbh . 
  so i dont know how to react to this . 
  then again , this description :  when i visited / r/de ( for the first and last time ) it seemed like a disgusting place full of brainwashed losers that turned off logical thinking . 
  seems to be apt for quite a few of the bigger subs . 
   i 'm very positively surprised by your post , because apparently it 's not always as hopeless there as i imagined . 
  presumably you speak german , so maybe visit the sub yourself and judge for yourself . 
  the link is in the google doc . 
  its possible i gave people more credit than they were due .
