  the point right now is to decide who takes care of how many , cause its the most immediate problem . 
  once that is done , you can let in as many refugees as you need , distribute them as was decided , and control more actively . 
  yeah well , those werent the founding principles of the eu , and its definitely not where germany wants the eu to be heading given the investments germany has made via transfer payments . 
  youre not going to sell this to germans with what just happened in greece , and seems to be a common theme over the last decade or so : germany pays . 
  i already posted this elsewhere : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exwfh6sgyso&amp;ab_channel=klute2006 ) came to mind -- but id be careful about shoving it all onto `` germany '' , cause its a ) not * just * or `` first and foremost '' germany and b ) merkel isnt germany . 
  i didnt see anyone else trying to step up and actually make something work in regards to refugees , did i ? 
  or was all that stuff drowned out in all the clamor about `` germany doing this '' and `` germany doing that '' ? 
  i dont see anything really constructive going on here , only blocking on an eu-wide scale . 
  i mean , what the fuck do people actually want ? 
  you cant have the benefits of an organization like the eu , and then not try and work with people when it comes to something where * you * might have to put something in ... just seems ridiculous to me . 
  from where im standing , kill it now . 
  this experiment has shown precisely what is eventually going to kill the union if people dont start to defer some power to eu wide authorities . 
  cause thats what were talking about here . 
  are you willing to give up some of your national sovereignity to the eu ? 
  read the wikiarticle mate . 
  you wont find the idea that germany would start another world war being key to the mountain union in there . 
  seriously , this was in 1951 . consider for one second the historical context ... 
  obviously . 
  cause youre making statements , which are downright devoid of facts . 
  get back when youre being reasonable and we can talk again . 
   there is just too much circlejerk on reddit , period , these days . 
  agreed . 
   but mass migration has many challenges associated and to think that just passing laws or making statements that `` x number of refugees go here , then y go there '' is sufficient does n't look at solving any of the problems . 
  neither do i. the idea to take on that many refugees is just downright moronic if you ask me ... especially due to the cultural differences and germanys history both from 1933 to 1945 and in regards to past handling of migrant workers . 
  i doubt this will end well . 
   to arbitrarily say that each group must take a piece of the total is nearing absurdity . 
  i dont think it would be arbitrary . 
  i think it would be based on estimates of what each country owuld be able to handle . 
  that seems like the german way of going about it to me . 
  then again , merkel has made some very `` ungerman '' decisions in the past ... 
   the ecsc was first proposed by french foreign minister robert schuman on 9 may 1950 as a way to prevent further war between france and germany . 
  its literally in the wiki article . 
  it wasnt to prevent a `` world war '' , it was to prevent a war between germany and france . 
  cause these two countries had been at each others throats for a century or so . 
  especially over alsace-lorrainne ( elsass-lothringen for the germans ) . 
  the notion of a split german state `` starting another world war '' ( learn your history , the first one started in austria , not germany ) is ludicrous . 
  especially when russia seemed to be the new big bad at the time ... just to rub it in a tad bit more :  the schuman declaration that created the ecsc had several distinct aims :  * it would mark the birth of a united europe . 
  * it would make war between member states impossible . 
  * it would encourage world peace . 
  * it would transform europe in a ` step by step ' process ( building through sectoral supranational communities ) leading to the unification of europe democratically , unifying two political blocks separated by the iron curtain . 
  * it would create the world 's first supranational institution . 
  * it would create the world 's first international anti-cartel agency . 
  * it would create a common market across the community . 
  * it would , starting with the coal and steel sector , revitalise the whole european economy by similar community processes . 
  * it would improve the world economy and the developing countries , such as those in africa . 
  all from the wiki . 
  its not that difficult to find this stuff . 
  seriously , get lost . 
  you dont know your shit . 
  and if you think germany will just let people drive through its country when the eu is abolished , youre in for another rough surprise . 
  edit : formatting, 
   what 's beneficial for everybody is great -- eea . 
  what 's not beneficial for everybody is n't that great . 
  so we should kill all the [ transfer payments ] ( http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-243792-thumbflex-xmfc.jpg ) germany and other rich countries are making to poorer eu states then ? 
  cause obviously those arent good for everyone , are they ? 
  theyre only good for the poorer countries . 
   ecsc was founded so you germans wo n't start another world war . 
  there 's no fear that czechs will do that . 
  yeah totally . 
  cause germany was in a state where it could actually * start a war * back then . 
  is that really what you think ? 
  are you mentally ill ? 
  the german state was * divided * it was * broken * . 
  there wasnt a snowballs chance in hell germany would start something again . 
   and no , eea will stay , since it is n't necessarily tied to the eu , there 's no reason for it to go down with the eu . 
  keep dreaming . 
  yeah well , i was using the opportunity to clarify my own position . 
  im just sick of the circlejerk a bit . 
  `` yeah , kill the eu , what did it ever do for us ? '', 
  it feels like a scene from monty pythons `` the life of brian '' : [ `` yeah lets get rid of the romans , what did they ever do for us ? 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exwfh6sgyso&amp;ab_channel=klute2006 ), 
  sooo ... whats beneficial to you is great , and what isnt isnt ? 
  does that about sum it up ? 
  the eu was founded on more than * just * economic benefits ( though its original predecessor , the [ `` mountain union '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_coal_and_steel_community ) , wasnt ) i think the first thing to go if the eu goes will be the eea . 
  simple as that . 
  cause it seems like one of germanys biggest bargaining chips . 
  due to the central location of the country , if germany * isnt * part of that agreement anymore , youll get a whole bunch of problems . 
  im not being an asshole . 
  im honestly saying : kill the eu . 
  lets see what happens . 
  maybe im wrong and all the other countries will be better off , and germany will be the worse for it ( wouldnt that be interesting ? ) . 
  but honestly , based on the economic transfers that happened in the past years , and especially now the greek crisis , im not convinced this is actually what is going to happen . 
  youll probably see a decline in the standard of living throughout europe ( including germany ) . 
  only thing is : i dont think germany will feel it quite as much as the other states ( again , i can be wrong ) . 
  just do it already and be done with it . 
  i honestly dont want to deal with all the bullshittery anymore . 
  let us see , what * actually * happens if the eu is suddendly dissolved . 
  cause at this point ... i honestly dont see what the point of the eu is anymore . 
  i just dont . 
  not if * this * is the result of the first stress test . 
  -- and just so were clear : im not in favor of merkels idea to get as many refugees as possible . 
  seems horribly thought out , and more of a hail mary to solve our demographics problem , cause i think by now it should become accute . 
  an injection of fresh immigrant blood should stall it long enough for merkel to not have to worry about her own pension . 
  can you explain it to me please ? 
  for the record : i think youre talking about the idea of universal human rights , shared responsibility , and trying to work together , but im honestly not certain . 
  no malicious intent here . 
  gaslighting seems an inapropriate term here . 
  would you be so kind as to explain to me what you meant ? 
  ( its an honest question , dont be alarmed ), 
  as a german : yupp .
