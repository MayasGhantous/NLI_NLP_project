well , the same can be said about the autobahn ( germany is a transit country , so * very * many transports from the whole eu/schengen area are using this roads , which were build by german taxes . 
  the smaller roadways ( landstra\u00dfen ) have a speed limit of 100kmh and so far stay free to use . 
  no , it only affects people who use the german autobahn . 
  it 's a fee , not a tax . 
  only if we can tax spaniards in germany for using ours . 
  so , no . 
  they already do that , at least in bavaria . 
  no , that 's no joke . 
  by the way , us has something similar , for [ bridges ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_toll_bridges ) . 
  * sigh * have an upvote . 
  as the other commenter said : this was a direct quote from cgpgrey , who talked about colonies and colonial empires in the world . 
  do n't feel insulted - watch the video ans see if you still are mad . 
  ahh france , the queen of not letting go . 
  nice to hear !, 
  yes , if that would bring any sentiments . 
  i for my part would like it , as much as i like the french-german thing . 
  i just wanted to ask if the population would accept something like this . 
  `` evil german money nazis '' and stuff ... 
  how about german ministers in your cabinet ? 
  would n't that be reason to worry , for the normal guy ? 
  europa universalis iv circlejerk anyone ? 
  til [ markus s\u00f6der ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/markus_s%c3%b6der ) is a franconian . 
  i do n't even have to click the link and can hear it ... 
  `` naples stays with us !, 
  [ we demand ] germany within the borders of 1228 a.d. '', 
  all the `` vernichtungslager '' were actually outside of the reichsgebiet . 
  most people were murdered ( by germans ) in the reichsgouvernement polen . 
  the lager on german ground ` only ' were `` sammel - or arbeitslager '' . 
  that 's heisenbergow . 
  valid argument . 
  hmm ... 
  96 is the maximum number of seats in the european parliament . 
  germany had 99 until the law changed . 
  did you drop this '' / s '' ? 
  i hope i got wooshed . 
  [ germany brought lenin into russia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/oktoberrevolution ) . 
   they could take berlin in one week . 
  mwhahahahaha ... hahaha ... ha !, 
  poland alone would break them . 
  no state can join nato when it has border disputes with other countries . 
  nato would have to chance rules or ukraine would have do waive claims on both crimea and ` novarussia ' . 
  maybe gon na remove the skulls from your hat , too ... 
  maybe not for american politics . 
  at least their leader is an ethnically german convertite . 
  does that count for two ? 
  [ to cut a long discussion short . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckp7gshwmnq#t=19 ), 
  i just read your original post as if that was the point you 're making `` even without eu the british helped poland '' - my point was : they did n't help chechoslowakia/sudetenland , they had no binding alliance with them . 
  for todays situation : you are right , i think they ( or the eu ) would support countries , even if they are not in the eu . 
  as they do in ukraine , kurdistan and many other countries in the world . 
  he took over the eastern part of poland , in agreement with nazi-germany . 
  there were n't an union then , but strongly allied with belgium and guaranteed polish souvereignity - do n't think they did this out of philantropy . 
  you 've been made mod in / r/moskva, 
  why , he is so much cuter than her !, 
  there you are heavy on the woodway . 
  * blame do n't you dare to bleam ( sic ! ), 
  this on your poor phone again !, 
  my comment :  do n't know that . 
  maybe you mean `` schadenfreude '' ? 
  you apparently * do * know german . 
  i 'll try to remember this . 
  edit : i ca n't even read your alphabet . 
  it looks like a cross between greek/kyrillic and sanskrit . 
  the only writing like this is georgian , which i also can not read . 
  i think it 's armenian writing . 
  same articles are coming up in germany . 
  read one in `` die zeit '' lately . 
  to reiterate : i can critizise the state of israel and its policy as much as i like - even can say the idf kills children ( wich is true , while the stereotype * `` the jew is a childkiller '' * is wrong ) - and still am ** no antisemite !! ** . 
  everyone who tells me i am an antisemite for critizising persons ( or institutions ) who happen to be jewish can fuck off . 
  ehem ... 
  which nazi-gold you are talking about ? 
  there never was any and we gave it all back . 
  ok let me ask again : how do i supposedly want europe to fall ? 
  edit : downvote ? 
  keep on trolling , / u/yaix :-), 
  see my other comment for this . 
  nowhere i say `` let poland deal with this alone '' . 
  all i am saying is , we do n't have to wonder that russia retaliates . 
  i think i want to eat a polish apple right now . 
   you like to fall , it appears . 
  how exactly ? 
  i am not disputing that . 
  european countries have to have solidarity with each other !, 
  oh come on . 
  enacting sanctions versus russia and getting butthurt if they enact sanctions too ? 
  france : * old french rifle to sell , never used and only dropped once . 
  * why do french streets mostly are alleys ( the streets with trees on both sides ) ? 
  because germans like to march in the shadow . 
  poland : * how many gears does a polish tank have ? 
  four reverse and one forward , in case the enemy comes from behind . 
  i did n't - i just laughed out loud because you wrote `` eastern european countries '' and the first thing which came in my mind where the three partitions of poland . 
  and * then * i saw your flag . 
  much kek :-), 
   back door deals between germany and russia generally do n't end well for the third party ( eastern european country x ) . 
  * looks at flair * seems to check out . 
  there is no censorhip in germany . 
  it is forbidden to say `` there is censorship in germany '' . 
  why , poland will be future-germany !, 
  stop considering , do it !, 
  if journalists can visit the area on the day after , you surely can do it a week later .
