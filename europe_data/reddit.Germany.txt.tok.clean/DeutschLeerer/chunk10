  i guessed so , but i wanted to explain that not every german wears lederhosen - or maybe as many as slovenes wear this : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/0758_volkstrachten_paar_in_traditioneller_oberkrainer-tracht_ ( slowenien ) , _ sanok_2013 . jpg, 
  in my childhood we played a game in school named `` wer hat angst vorm schwarzen mann . '', 
  - `` who 's afraid of the black man '' . 
  bayern is as much germany as all the other bundesl\u00e4nder . 
  kinda complicated . 
  ah reddit , you never disappoint . 
  well , i once did not beat them up , but they wo n't get better !!, 
  in my city in germany , we do . 
  and it works out fine . 
  almost the same crime rates and standard of living as the rest of our immigrant populace . 
  flula is best !, 
  my brain hurts when i hear him talk . 
  have you seen `` shooting fish in a barrel '' or `` daddy long legs '' ? 
  who would 've guessed !, 
   [ ... ] oops where is my phone ??? 
  shit on the train . 
  [ ... ] to shit on the train is not the best course of action - and dangerous too !, 
  you are right ( `` right '' huhuh ) . 
  * you * are a fascist , not pegida . 
  it is n't confirmed they tried to attack the race , mind that before you spew brainless catchphrases . 
  what the hell has pegida to do with this , you propagandistic fascistoid f ** k. 
  the public prosecution office has confirmed that the two arrested persons belong to the salafist/wahabi scene . 
  they had a pipe bomb , ready to use . 
  tomorrow there will be a big bicycle race around frankfurt/main , but they do n't have evidence of a concrete plan to attack this event . 
  apparently the suspects were monitored and because of the event , the police decided to strike today . 
  well , nowadays they have * many * potatoes . 
  germans like potatoes . 
  other than that , also nothing . 
  i mean , it 's an interesting island with old culture and nice people , but i do n't know either . 
  oh yes , there even is a picture of the flag in the article . 
  which flair would that be ? 
  maybe message the mods - or make one yourself ? 
  we could call the parts * generalgouvernement deutschland * and * wielkopolski * or something like that . 
  what is this `` joke '' you 're talking about ? 
  sometimes , but it definitely is meant as a joke . 
  you could avoid this phrase entirely , like they did in the greek version . 
  question : did you purposely mention erdogan and g\u00fclen in one sentence ? 
  i thought they were rivals/enemies ? 
  you did n't really say that , did you ? 
  i bet this comment was edited by our l\u00fcgenpresse . 
  looks more like / pol / . 
   it 's `` equally populated '' , not `` equally sized '' . 
  yes it is . 
  i would like to see a map with `` equally economic output '' . 
  yes it does . 
  the taxes go directly to the city , so the big money has more control than mom and pop . 
   2/10 would not bang . 
  yea , her ellbows are * way * to pointy . 
  so the `` german question '' is actually if we stay a puppet of the us - because if we try to be in the middle between russia and the us ( speak * european * ) the us-empire will fail ? 
  let 's become neutral , folks . 
  and i mean this as `` european , and not an ally/puppet of the us nor russia . '', 
  yea but to always turn the other cheek does n't make much sense , when 500 battle hardened ( potential ) murderers want to come back to your country . 
  yes it is - and * you * coined it !, 
  all hail / u/kaeptn _ lechuck !, 
  so , essentially the `` no true nazi '' fallacy ? 
  i do n't know but i wan na scream at you right now !, 
  since `` handy '' is a slang for `` einen runterholen '' , the answer is easy . 
  / r/europeanculture is better suited for stuff like that . 
  yes . 
  would you please use the [ lord 's resistance army , under infamous `` kony '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%e2%80%99s_resistance_army ) the next time ? 
  makes a better argument than those wbc softie jerks . 
   nato is a defensive alliance , it has done nothing aggressive whatsoever . 
  [ ... ] reality check [ ... ] [ here 's a reality check for you . 
  ] ( https://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/russia_wants_war_look_how_closely_they_put_country_to_our_military_bases.jpg ), 
  try / r/europeanculture or / r/europeans instead . 
  well , it 's easier to become a prostitute than to become a woman . 
  edit : i want to donate 75 off this upvotes to / r/titlegore . 
  that 's the slogan of our luftwaffe . 
  do they screen the movies in original language ? 
  well , if it 's pulp fiction , i probably could learn chzech through it , i know the dialogues by heart . 
  if it 's to boring , we always could sit together and answer the old question : `` when does the narwhal beacon ? '', 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ at ^ ^ midnight , ^ ^ but ^ ^ pshhhh ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ spoil ^ ^ it . 
  also : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_museums_in_prague * in theatre : alice in wonderland , don giovanni , classical concert at the prague castle , pachebel mozart and vivaldi at the municipal house - and many more . 
  * some chzech guy could show us their typical food , excellent beer , best dancing clubs , nice parks , lead a tour through the old city , red light area and shopping malls . 
  * learn a few words of chzech * play ingress * go to quiz night * maybe life musik , a concert or karaoke ? 
  * i personally would like to see the famous window ( see `` defenestration '' or `` 1 . 
  prager fenstersturz '' ) * oh and since jewish areas are quite an interesting place in most eastern cities ( kasimierz , i 'm looking at you ) - i want to see josefstadt/josevov . 
  feel free to add . 
  so ... do they still steal our jobs or what ? 
  also becomes suddenly `` liberated '' . 
  that 's another can of worms right there , would be a good discussion for an extra thread , but : why is it , that so many 3rd generation immigrants ( who have a german passport , hell , sometimes even their parents have one ! ), 
  do identify still as the nationality of their grandparents ? 
  i work in school , and i have `` turks '' in my family , and i am still encountering this `` i am a turk , kurd , whatever - but i am not german '' things ... 
   jury ? 
  edit : i just wanted to stress that there is * no * jury system in germany . 
  sorry for misunderstanding . 
  depends on : is the burglar armed ? 
  did he threaten you or others ? 
  are there more than one ? 
  are you disabled or weak ? 
  even if i 'd get attacked , i 'm only allowed ( `` exactly '' ) as much force as is needed to stop the attack/prevent another attack from happening . 
  if you are asking especially about `` castle laws '' - no such thing exists in germany . 
  on the contrary : if you do a `` citizen arrest '' , you are * not allowed * to use force . 
  you may only announce it and wait for the police . 
  before you shake your head : this rules have a distinct plus - burglars and thiefs , and to an extend even robbers do n't carry guns/weapons as often as in countries with other laws . 
  it depends . 
  generally there 's the rule : lawful people do n't have to avoid unlaeful people - you have the right to defend yourself ( notwehr ) and others ( nothilfe ) . 
  this defence has to be ` reasonable ' . 
  you are only allowed to use force to stop an attack or to prevent expected further attacks . 
  but you ca n't defend your stuff or yourself with deadly force .
