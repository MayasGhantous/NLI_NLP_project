  there have been cases of notwehr were the assailant was killed and the defender was not jailed - if one believes ( even falsly ) to have no other choice , a unreasonable defence wo n't be prosecuted . 
  well ... punching people * is * illegal . 
  minimum penalty , oh ... 
   while theft is only a `` vergehen '' ( misdemeanor ? ) ... 
  what ? 
  do n't spread false information . 
  http://dejure.org/gesetze/stgb/242.html theft carries punishment up to 5 years in jail . 
  one thousand `` police known multiple offenders '' are congregating in the train station - and the police does n't do anything ? 
  thank you . 
  the typical word when determinativ-komposita are taught is : `` donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapit\u00e4nsm\u00fctze '' . 
  take that , schlaganfall . 
  indeed it is , partly . 
  in the fifth line . 
  ( on mobile ), 
  it happened in syrian territory . 
  really ? 
  yes , turkey shot down a russian plane . 
  with the actual polish strength ( both military - and politicswise ) i can support this . 
  ~ ~ fascism ~ ~ representative democracy you 're partly right though : i 'll bet no refugees live next to the politicians who decided this . 
   many syrians wo n't return home if assad is in power , i bet more will return home under assad than under isis - or even a fuckfest like iraq . 
   ... for you to masturbate other what ? 
  do you expect me to masturbate while misspelling the word `` over '' ? 
  i would never masturbate over iliterates , you are the problem with masturbation . 
  ehem . 
  / s ps : maybe you meant it . 
  so ... masturbating * others * is a possibility ... 
  i thought that would be the nederlands . 
  for me austria is more like the strange uncle nobody talks about . 
  slut = end , ending ? 
  more like `` exist '' . 
  mark the whole balkans and write `` albanians shqip here '', 
  better idea , monaco invades france and albert gets to be king ? 
  well ... nevermind . 
  me too . 
  ( regarding the strike more than the direction of fallout . 
  why not open a new thread about the ( important ) criticism of islam ? 
  and argue about berlin politics in here ? 
  you are derailing the argument to win it .

  `` its own cem \u00d6zdemir '', 
  frauke petry spoke publicly about shooting people ( refugees ) who cross the eu borders illegally . 
  but hey , only men and women . 
  children could be captured and sent back . 
  tl ; dr : comparable to geert wilders . 
  another * solution * ? 
  ok , but can this one be f. . . abulous ? 
  woah , i saw your flag and read austria . 
  imagine my surprise when the guy said `` by boat '' . 
  what ? 
  iran * is * in asia ? 
  i think it 's pretty shitty to participate in traffic intoxicated ... but i respect her move to accept responsibility and to immediatly resign . 
  very well said !, 
  they werent . 
  one was member of the european parliament in 1990 , in the same fraction as jm le pen . 
  the other one invented the [ rezeptions-\u00c4sthetik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reader-response_criticism ) a way of interpreting literature . 
  there seem to be some more . 
  source , link above . 
  whatever that means . 
  well , most of the times at least . 
  i do n't know if the eu member states should or would transition into a common armed force . 
  as this question is not absolute imho , i advocate for a strengthening and even expansion of a/the european armed forces . 
  but , and this is a big ` but ' , no state should completely dissolve or transition its national af into this eaf . 
  imo small states * should be allowed * to do this ( think andorra , luxembourg ) but the eu right now is a political monster , a combined army would scare me somehow . 
  and the russians for sure . 
  so after my rambling , would you kindly differenciate your `` pro eu '' stance and your assesment of the developement ? 
  i 'm interested . 
  good points . 
  i did n't want to declare this a * de jure * eu army . 
  this wo n't be possible for decades . 
  we do n't even have a fiscal union ( what 's the english word ? 
  common taxes and budgets ... ) which is a crucial requirement for a common standing army . 
  that 's not the point , because like you say  it depends on how one defines an eu army . 
  but the `` europe of two speeds '' thing has already begun in military aspects . 
  we have already several joint forces , may they be the 18 battlegroups , the dutch/german-corps and so on . 
  ... which translates roughly to  a person recruiting or helping to recruite a german citizen for a foreign power 's be it a military or similar organisation ( think militia ) will be punished with jail , ranging from 3 month to 5 years . 
  do other countries have similar laws ? 
  this paragraph could be the reason for it leading and inviting other countries by germany . 
  note that * joining * a foreign army does n't lead to the loss of german citizenship anymore ( eu , nato and cool countries at least ) . 
  but promoting and recruiting is still forbidden . 
  opinions anyone ? 
  is n't this * exactly * what is happening ? 
  g\u00f6ring comes to hitler into the staatskanzlei and tells him : `` mein f\u00fchrer , italy joined the war ! '', 
  hitler rubs his hands and says , `` gut , gut , send two divisions to rome . '', 
  g\u00f6ring : `` aber mein f\u00fchrer , they joined on our side ... '' hitler pales and stammers : `` then send ten ! '',

   ukraine ukraine ... nato ... choose one . 
  what is it now ? 
  20 pages of paperwork ? 
   nuclear weapons are not used by launching them . 
  that 's what i was saying . 
   ... russia has free lunch and can simply demand stuff from any non nuclear european country . 
  like they did with crimea in ukraine - they rolled in and declared crimea the russian territory . 
  you are contradicting yourself . 
  they did n't * demand * , they * rolled in * .
