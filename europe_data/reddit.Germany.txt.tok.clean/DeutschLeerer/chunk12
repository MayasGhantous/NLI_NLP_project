  you say it . 
  my question stands : do you realistically see russia attacking a european country ? 
  yes . 
  if they want to conquer , they would n't destroy it all . 
  i hope . 
  nuclear weapons aside ... do you really think russia would attack europe in a whim ? 
  i do n't want to argue here , just an explanation . 
  it is a difference if you spend your military budget for new weapons , planes and ships * or * if you mostly pay the soldiers wages ( and pensions ) with it . 
  i do n't know about the greek situation though . 
  the only thing i know is that greece spends more ( % ) than germany for example . 
  you are right . 
  no you do n't . 
  but it is a grauzone . 
  if you simply pick up a weapon ( stick , kitchen knife , key ring , springerstiefel [ wtf german law ? ] ), 
  to defend someone against an unarmed attacker you could be charged . 
  you probably would n't be indicted ... `` i 'm eifer des gefechts '' . 
  but let 's say this guy took a photograph of your girlfriend - yes , the law covers this - and you took your umbrella and beat him and give him a soft kick in the ass , as he lies on the ground , this is `` notwehrexzess '' . 
  ^ ^ oh ^ ^ how ^ ^ do ^ ^ i ^ ^ love ^ ^ korinthenkacken, 
  so you are a judge ? 
  that 's why i argument for a corrective . 
  `` bland altruism '' would be nirvana , if everyone would live like that . 
  like communism . 
  but we both agree this is n't possible . 
  in an ideal world though ... 
  i do n't think he will , i was just making a point about the general ` notwehr/nothilfe ' . 
  your example is fitting . 
  someone help us all !, 
  yes we do . 
  i 'm not only talking about the population but also political at this point . 
  * the british are part of the same cultural , historic and philosophical family * uk has excellent relations to usa and commonwealth * uk has big immigrant population ( same as eu but different [ cw again ] ) * every power ( eu ) needs a counterweight to balance it . 
  i 'd love to have a nagging briton ** in ** eu to influence decisions i do n't like * why do you think eu leaders are making such a fuzz about gb leaving ? 
  they are scared as shit . 
  summa summarum ** do n't let us alone with france **, 
  sorry but this is factually ** false ** !, 
  please edit your comment accordingly , this could prove useful for others . 
  so , it would n't be permitted to * enter a car and crash into the attacker * but it would n't be necessary * to exit it and beat the attacker * see http://www.juraforum.de/lexikon/nothilfe in section i. 2 for a detailed explanation . 
  to expand on that : if you want to help a victim , and shoot an unarmed attacker it could be possible you get charged with `` notwehrexzess '' :  ein notwehrexzess liegt dann vor , wenn sich der notwehraus\u00fcbende nicht \u00fcber die voraussetzungen der notwehr irrt , sondern die grenzen der notwehr aufgrund eines sog . 
  which is kind of a good trait - if we have some buddies to correct it when needed . 
  ^ ^ uk ^ ^ pls ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ leave !, 
  ^ ^ we ^ ^ need ^ ^ you, 
  albania versus whom ? 
  great britain will be downgraded to just ok britain . 
  do n't feed the troll please . 
  i do n't like it - i just said it 's the law . 
  that would be extremely intrusive ( and illegal ) , regarding our laws . 
  you misunderstood . 
  intentionally ? 
  a majority of ** voters ** voted akp . 
  pro tip for propaganda : include children as well , maybe you can push the numbers even lower !, 
  also , turks in germany voted for akp ( erdo\u011fans party ) in the majority . 
  is n't it only in cases of defensive wars ? 
  it 's the greek way . 
  but we will buy ** five ** ouzo per person . 
  that 's the german way . 
  yea , i 'd guess poland , since they have all our tanks . 
  we could tell them there are refugees who want to go to poland or something ... 
  the last ones ( mgm-31 ) stationed in germany were demolished in 1991 . 
  [ german wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/mgm-31_pershing#abr.c3.bcstung ) . 
  [ :-( ] ( http://www.angelfire.com/ga2/highadventure/images/hesswonder.jpg ), 
  well , movies too . 
  but we can understand each other too !, 
  we 're even learning your language so you like us !, 
  in english , is there a semantic difference between surrendering and capitulating ? 
  it says `` friendly '', 
  why not make it two kings and see if the situation gets worse ? 
  [ you were saying ? 
  this is true about [ swans . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swan_upping ) ca n't imagine it for mushrooms . 
  what would those suspicious circumstances be ? 
  poland ? 
  can you acces foreign porn sites ? 
  or would the owner pay taxes in romania too ? 
  deception ? 
  `` if you kiss me between the legs , i will become a prince ! '', 
  \\* 12 years of prison * ( joke aside , this is similar to sweden , afaik . ), 
  schloss is palace . 
  burg would be castle . 
  so ... palace moat festival . 
  also , no chainmail but fancy hats and colorful coatumes please . 
   flood the country but , but ... 
  i get the swiss blockading roads , tunnels and stuff . 
  but why would you flood your own country ? 
  that seems extreme . 
  the joke here is : 1st , 2nd , 3rd . 
  hey cool and we do n't even have to fight for ourselves since [ we sold a few of them to poland . 
  have you never eaten those tiny hot dogs , k\u00f6ttbullar or the cookies at ikea ? 
  savage !, 
  that to do sounds as if could it fun make ( das zu tun , klingt als k\u00f6nnte es spa\u00df machen . ), 
  i will this also times try . 
  what happens if they leave * before * the uk leaves ? 
  would they stay in ? 
  i think it was the offshoot from the left corner , not just from spd . 
  urgs . 
  up until now , i had . 
  thank you * very much * . 
  ok .  also in both cases ( do n't mind the saxons ) the language is german . 
  also in both cases the language is german . 
  a good gulp of a good wine has made the evening better ? 
   this clown he was n't talking about charlie chaplin . 
  i hereby condemn you rhetorics .
