  brethren of / r/europe , follow me into this completely justified crusade !, 
  so ... getting no special treatment is considered unfair ? 
  it is n't , has to be enough viral matter . 
  like , a mosquito ca n't transmit it . 
  and we 're talking about a similar order of magnitude . 
  sponsored by whatever is not to your liking . 
  so far i 've heard russia , cia , freemasons/illuminati , npd , jewish world conspiracy , wto ... 
  i think you misinterpret : most of them are anti-gouvernment . 
  or at least anti fat cat . 
  since the government is middle-right right now , the are `` left '' . 
  oh so you think breitbart is fake news ? 
  two can play that game : http://m.dw.com/en/german-chancellor-merkel-working-to-hold-the-eu-together/a-37464058 https://www.neweurope.eu/article/macron-praises-angela-merkel/ https://sputniknews.com/europe/201609141045284339-germany-merkel-policy-refugees/ https://www.ft.com/content/95273a42-c078-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354 http://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-angela-merkel-the-last-leader-of-the-free-world/, 
  the amount of media coverage is n't the fault of reddit commenters but rather the workings of your ( us ) * media * , do n't you think ? 
  \u00dd\u0173\u00f5 wh\u00e5\u0165 m\u0105\u021b\u0117 ? 
  \u010c\u00f8m\u00eb \u00e6\u0163 m\u0115 b\u0159\u0151 !, 
  i guess you 're right somehow - if those floats were in the us , they would 've been sponsored by a party/pac . 
  be assured , some people in those karneval-associations * are * members of a party , but they are building and financing them as private citizens . 
  also , regarding which topics are actual , the always criticise politics in general . 
  search for the floats of the last years if you do n't believe me . 
  private citizens . 
  edited link . 
  i think when you argue about the meaning of the word ` contract ' , you wo n't regard any argument from my side . 
  maybe search some sources which help your argument then ?

  straight from article 1.1 , page 3 . 
   uk membership of the european union ( eu ) creates rights and obligations : for the uk as a state , for individual citizens , and for businesses and other organisations . 
  there are cross-cutting rights and obligations , such as the uk 's right to a say in the making of eu laws , ** and its obligation to comply with them once agreed . 
  ** edit : now you give me a document o why states can agree on laws and funding and somehow do n't have to fulfill those contracts later . 
   there is no legal reason [ ... ] there is . 
  it 's called a `` contract '' . 
  how did eu act like a ` twat ' ? 
  ( i assume you mean ` unfair ' ) did n't uk agree on the conditions ? 
  no arguing here , i just try to understand your sentiment . 
   the money is not strictly a charge for leaving since * the bill comprises various financial commitments made during the u.k. 's membership , such as pension obligations to eu officials and past pledges to the bloc 's budget and projects . 
  * [ italics by me ] ther * is * a legal obligation , or what else would you call a signed treaty ?

  he cares so less of romania , it 's worth three comments . 
  interesting . 
  how would the deal be reciprocal ? 
  what does eu get for agreeing to void the rules ? 
  uk : can we just not play by the rules ? 
  eu : no let 's play by the agreed rules . 
  uk : \\* angry \\* yolo !, 
  country describes the ethnicity ( kind of ) while nation implies the concept of `` state '' . 
  kind of . 
   russian u it 's pronounced '' \u00fcpsilon '' you plebeians . 
  so ... the original memes were cringe inducing ? 
  now do `` i am * indifferent * to the germans '' !, 
  i asked myself for some minutes `` where 's the protest ? '', 
  because seeing eu-flags is just so common in my area . 
  i 'll be drinking a hitler or two later . 
  join me , maybe let 's meet in warsaw ? 
  thanks . 
  i knew you would agree . 
  i post stupid pictures of women in nazi uniform on 4chan . 
  i * wish * i would get payed . 
  germany will combat fake news and russian upvote-bot-networks . 
  not employ this tactics ourselves . 
  what would be the german reeeeeeee ? 
  i propose w\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4 !, 
  to sing praise , maybe ? 
  and more like ` mersi ' . 
  but even the spoken language differs vastly between north , south and even napoli ?

  like zeeland and holland in the netherlands ? 
  do n't joke , there are people who think the jews were responsible for the holocaust . 
  like in : they organised it and used the nazis for its execution . 
  cool , i was in oswiecim/krakow last year . 
  what do people ask about polish guards ? 
  and what is your answer ? 
  translate.google.com can :  cologne - with machine guns , they were supposed to protect a christmas market in cologne - but the two policemen had no ammunition magazines in their arms . 
   after numerous reactions in the social networks on thursday to a photo in the `` k\u00f6lner stadt-anzeiger '' , the chief police director michael temme speaks of a single case . 
  `` my employees are very aware that only a machine gun that can be used immediately provides the protection that people and also the policemen used in emergency situations need , '' he said on thursday in a report from the cologne police . 
   a magazine in the western bag is not sufficient for fast availability . 
  he had caused the superiors of the two policemen and the section leader to have a clarifying conversation . 
  ( dpa ) - source : http://www.ksta.de/25363940 \u00a9 2016 badly . 
  so , the two police officers had their ammunition in bags on their uniform . 
  the other 22 ( uniformed ) officers at the weihnachtsmarkt were armed with loaded guns .

  thank [ this guy , bomber harris ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/arthur_harris ) . 
  he was responsible for ordering the carpet bombing of german civilians . 
   br\u00f6tchen ist hochdeutsch and that is what everyone learns . 
  no strawman , no strawman !, 
  ( really , is n't it more like `` moving the goalposts '' ? ), 
  at what age did * you * try to kill people at a christmas market , then ?
