  `` yea well go fuck yourself / s '' the / s does n't always make it funny , that 's my point . 
  please do n't go fuck yourself . 
  top kek !, 
  not that ... 
  whom = accusative it really is that easy . 
  well , even in percentage - the raise in defense spending has to come out of other branches ( healthcare , education , infrastructure ) . 
  no difference if you say it in % or $ . 
  flag too . 
  you have been banned from / r/minsk . 
   gutenberg , charlemagne , mozart too many germans . 
  [ explanation ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/berliner_pfannkuchen ), 
  look at [ this map ] ( http://imgur.com/t6knzru ) . 
  it explains much . 
  i can understand the ` problems ' between bavaria and the saupreissn . 
  do you actually know where the hate towards bavaria comes from ? 
  or is this more like ` tradition ' . 
   special words `` la france d'outre-mer '' or `` dom '', 
  what 's a hoity toity ? 
  ^ ^ too ^ ^ lazy ^ ^ to ^ ^ google, 
  there should , and there should be a maximum wage , too . 
  i did n't get you . 
  i 'm just upvoting , do n't mind me . 
  i do n't know how this should be of importance . 
  wow . 
  you actually explained what a joke is * and * got me to laugh . 
  so meta !, 
  ** germany : ** * most people in my region ca n't stand s\u00e4chsisch , a variation from the area arount the state saxony . 
  it has a negative reputation for `` being simple '' and the ( relatively more ) nasal and strained sounds just sound funny and silly . 
  i for myself like it very much , since the vocabulary can be completely different , which makes this variant interesting and complicated . 
  * \u00d6sterreichisch is another one , combined with the traditional playful hostility between germans and austrians , we ( in this case , i ) feel stressed while hearing \u00d6sterreichisch . 
  it 's * almost * german , but in the end it is n't , which leaves your brain a mess . 
  ** england : ** * i * love * hearing and trying to understand cockney . 
  i wish i 'd speak glaswegian , since i saw some skits by a north-english comedian . 
  i understood him quite well , but all the weird blubber from the mouth of north english people ... omg , a completely new language !, 
  i am astonished how many variants this little island has . 
  see australian , american or restoftheworldian . 
  ** france : ** * i do n't speak french , but i saw the movie `` the sh ` ties '' . 
  seems to be a northern french variant ( possibly bretons ? ), 
  and it is reported to sound very funny in the ear of a native french speaker ? 
  ** netherlands : ** * dutch sounds like drunk german . 
  i like it , especially when drunk . 
   82 %  17 % 1 % would n't talk to a strange man without their husband present, 
  this is a very informative picture , thank you very much !, 
  yes , i can affirmate both of your theories . 
  latent anti-americanism and a feeling of guilt do both play into my attitude . 
  not really . 
  my country was held back by the cold war , not by the russians only . 
  also only for 45 years . 
  i must say , i respect your position regarding russia , but can not understand it completely . 
  regarding this motives , please see the [ other comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/29cxkh/lavrov_russia_wants_eu_to_have_good_relations/cijwms0 ) i made . 
  i just do n't get the whole `` russia is evil '' drift . 
  sure , russia has its own interessts . 
  sure , they annexed krim and support seperatists in ukraine . 
  sure , they do some other stuff right now . 
  but , here 's my problem with it : this happens always and by ( almost ) every other nation , especially the eu and us . 
  i can not believe that * we are the poor victims here * . 
  nothing happens without provocation , and russia does not stir up europe without reason . 
  i do n't say this reason would be worth it for other countries , but there has to be a ` valid ' reason from russian side . 
  and now , after we toppled the ( eastern leaning ) gouvernment of ukraine , which wanted to trade more with russia - and installed a western leaning gouvernment , which wants to trade more with eu and us - i simply ca n't understand why we wonder that russia reacts . 
  another thing : if i 'd say `` i want that russia and china have good relations , but stay independent . 
  '' , is this troublesome somehow ? 
  am i a bad person when i want this too ? 
  i like good relations with the us , but we should remain independent . 
  where seems to be the problem ? 
  definitely the first . 
  even rome was n't build in one day . 
  mabe in ten years more uk citizens will favour the eu ( or better , their involvement into the european thought ) . 
  so do n't you have some old guys who retire soon ? 
  i would buy one . 
  since the bavarian state is holding the rights to it , this book ca n't be bad . 
  i 've seen [ some cool pictures ] ( http://imgur.com/tb0apn8 ) by this hitler guy , but never heard much about him . 
  did he also play music ? 
  upvote for honesty !, 
  all you stupid bigotted downvoters , he is participating in , hell even * adding * to this conversation and you downvote him ? 
  i am a avid supporter of the principles of the eu and the uk staying in it and strenghten it , but i do n't downvote based on herd mentality . 
  depends what you would expect by `` normal life '' . 
  most of them are working , have a family and friends . 
  they get by , either by active help of others or by excuses ( left my glasses at home , i have hurt my hand ) . 
  but , they do n't get by * easily * . 
  it hinders you when you can not read street names , letters , invitations , sms , books , even an advertising billboard . 
  our society makes it easy to be iliterate : - big classrooms ( the loud students with bad writing abilities get seated in the back or get pushed into the next grade , just because the teachers can not do all the things at once ) - everywhere pictures or symbols . 
  you do n't need to write or read , you find everything . 
  toilett ? 
  train station ? 
  center of town ? 
  - the technical advancement `` helps '' too . 
  you can now * tell * your cell phone what to write and whom to call . 
  no need to even type a message anymore . 
  to get back to your question : yes , it may be easy to live a normal life , if you have your coping mechanisms . 
  i 'll bet you already know an `` analphabet '' but are not aware of his/her lack of skills . 
  i wanted to say `` we speak german '' , that 's the title of a polish book for learning german , i have in my bookcase . 
  that 's depending on how you measure it . 
  i work in this field and newer studies speak of 5 million `` functional iliterates '' . 
  this may still sound high but it includes people who can write their name , read simple things like street-signs or `` achtung lebensgefahr '' - schilder but no letter from the arbeitsamt . 
  really high ? 
  but understandable . 
  * tourism * transit country for hinz und kunz on their way to south-east europe * direct neighbour of austria ( ? ), 
  was it vacation ? 
  in tourist regions , virtually everyone speaks some ( or ten ) foreign languages . 
  moviemu pa nimiecky !,
