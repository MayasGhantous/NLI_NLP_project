  no , i still have my hair , thank you . 
  teuro ? 
  dutch pronounciation : `` duuro '', 
  hey , what about germany [ building a high speed railroad corridor through poland ] ( http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/korytarz_polski ) , to connect lituania ? 
  you do n't have enemies in the west anymore :-), 
  he is describing `` trickle down economics '' . 
  very cynical , too . 
  for really changing ones diet , you need to switch to a way of eating , * which gives you pleasure but is healthy also '' . 
  no one would sustain a live long diet on tasteless powder/shakes . 
  that 's not what you said when the us seceded . 
   the only reason the dutch are doing this is because of their drug policies . . 
  so much wat . 
   especially after wwii exactly that is the catch !, 
  no way to go to war against those countries , since they would instantly know . 
  at least he ` ate you . 
  it is . 
  i think they accepted lomg afo that they never could go back . 
  especially after brandt . 
  they visited their place of birth , after the fall of the iron curtain . 
  as it seems the polish family now living there is quite nice , and even invited them in for coffee . 
  ( they would n't give back the house , though ), 
  no they were ethnic germans living in germany . 
  after the war , those `` ostgebiete '' fell to poland . 
  since my grandparents families did not want to assimilate they fled west . 
  no , i look dumb because even the name ak-47 implies this fact . 
  hey at least we both get upvotes . 
  edited . 
  russian soldiers who rape and threaten the ( german ) population into leaving . 
  i will visit poland with my family . 
  since i am grown up by now , this will be a very weird holidays - camping with my 60yo mom . 
  for the reason : my grandparents came from the former german regions , while my grandfather served in the marine , my grandmother fled from the russians , after getting their house shot up . 
  she still has a framed picture of her father and grandfather , * with a bullet hole from an ~ ~ ak ~ ~ rifle through it * . 
  i will be visiting gorzow wielkopolski ( formerly known as `` landsberg an der warthe '' -  grandfathers house ) , drive through lipiany ( lipehne -  grandmothers house ) , then bath at the baltic sea ( ostsee ) and maybe do a sightseeing tour through gdansk ( danzig ) . 
  so , a quite historically intersting tour , at least for me . 
  german name for lorraine is also `` lothringen '' after its founder [ `` lothar '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lothair_i ) . 
  gorbatchow tried to sell kaliningrad/k \u00f6nigsberg in 1999 , for lousy 40 billion euros . 
  itt : * trollbait * `` but i do n't wan na be a muslim '', 
  i 'd guess dutch would be `` korruptie '' ? 
   [ ... ] diplomacy [ ... ] trade [ ... ] best option for uk [ ... ] so you want to reap all the benefits , but not contribute a fair ( whatever that word means ) share ? 
  give it five years . 
  so if you can be english * and * british , why not a little bit of european next to it ? 
   guess what - i just googled ` transnational class system ' , and nothing came up . 
  that means that you 're just making shit up as you go , and your words do n't actually have any meaning behind them . 
  guess , what - i did the same and got about a million results . 
  maybe you 're the one making shit up here ... 
  do you think this will change after leaving the eu ? 
  and for the worse or for the better ? 
  it 's a valid plan if one meets some prerequisites . 
  * eu-citizenship * money for at least three month of living ( and housing ) in advance * a solid education , aprenticeship or degree * good understanding of the german language * a job ( try [ the official page of the german ministry of work ] ( http://www.jobcenter-ge.de/ ) for starters ) as other commenters already said : you 're welcome here . 
  ^ ^ ^ terms ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ conditions ^ ^ ^ may ^ ^ ^ apply . 
  astonishingly few of them . 
  we have a `` save third country '' rule , which means if they flee/immigrate through a safe neighbouring country , they are here illegaly . 
  our `` naher osten '' is also called `` levante '' , a geographical ( no , more * cultural * ) aproach , which also is understood in the english speaking world . 
  and a basisti is a supporter of the president ? 
   sunt multi basisti pe reddit , n-ai ce-i face what is a basisti ? 
  certainly not the musician !, 
  no i am talking like i did n't knew this fact until now . 
  i was under the impression of the north being quite industrial but the south more of an agricultural ( sorry , `` poorer '' ) region . 
   real life is not civilization v nice demagogic argument . 
   the uk is not an influential nation because they have a lot of ships . 
  not only because of this , but it helps ... no , i wo n'tpick your words to pieces , i shall rephrase : `` since the european parliament has no real might yet , italy should work in areas where it has prestige and experience ( things i mentioned ) . 
  parliamentary work certainly is ** not ** one of these fields of expertise . '', 
  depends on how you define a leader . 
  certainly they wo n't become military ( france ) , naval ( gb ) , industrial , or economical * leader * . 
  with the italian experience in culture and politics though - historical and the last 60 years italy is a power house !, 
  i can imagine them italian diplomats doing very fine work . 
  maybe `` infiltrate '' the eu-organisations , for more indirect power ? 
  maybe no commissar for industry ( antonio tajani has this position atm ) but culture , language or politics ? 
   they have no idea what occupation even means . 
  `` they use the word occupation wrong '' ftfy but joke aside , the definition of occupation * is * complicated , i would argue germany to still be occupied by the allies . 
  several baracks of gb , france , belgium , netherlands and us . 
  2009 it was 80.000 troops . 
  but very cool to ride . 
  was in spain with an interrail ticket for three weeks , and the trains were speedy , punctual , clean and * ice cold temperated * , like heaven in 40 \u00b0 weather . 
  the highest court does not prohibit it , i 'd say . 
  and while i never would do the salute myself , i aprecciate the concept of freedom of expression . 
  thank you , is this from a commentary ? 
  would you post the source please . 
  allowed = / = okay, 
  no word of `` armed '' . 
  resistance , yes , but within the normal criminal justice laws . 
  why do you assume the non-voters would not vote npd in the same distribution as the voters ? 
   the principle of the second chamber in germany , the bundesrat , is exactly the same . 
  as is the us senate , ~ ~ and the european commision ~ ~ ( two constituents from every state , regardless the number of inhabitants ) . 
  smaller states/nations/regions tend to get to be overrepresentated , but as i said , i think that 's needed for the democratic process . 
  but the csu just competes in bavaria - and has an agreement with the cdu that neither they will run in bavaria nor the csu in the remainder of the republic . 
  do n't know if you are serious ... those two parties have a special agreement , and have a joint list . 
  since in germany * all parties * competed with a common list * for all of germany * , your argument is moot . 
  edit : also , for clarification , `` we '' means `` the german voters '' . 
  we are underrepresented , yes . 
  but imho , that 's ok . we are overrepresentated in a few other aspects of politics , too . 
  look in the sidebar , right beyond the user-counter it says :  show my flair on this subreddit ... check the box and klick on  edit behind your nickname .

  small portions , would guess max 5g of very ^ very ^ ^ very bad weed . 
  about 20 $ around here . 
  not that i would spend the money ...

  germany : 3 $ ( $ 4 ) for 0.4 l ( 12 oz ) at 5 % alcohol . 
  in case of indication of violence , there are games where no alcohol gets served in the arena an in the vicinity of it ( shops , gas stations ) .
