  german hooligans get seldom drunk though , they meet up after the games and fight , you do n't want to be ( too ) drunk for this .

  some are literal translations , some are my comments . 
  i do n't get you in your first paragraph ... anyways : if you go for funny , the right-wingers are on the top : http://imgur.com/a/gx2wt, 
  it 's one of the few election posters which is completely true . 
  well , did you hear of the austrian politician j\u00f6rg haider , who crashed into a wall because of high speed ? 
  `` gas geben '' is an * innuendo * of his death and his right wing attitude , gas as in `` nazi '' . 
  does this count ? 
  sorry , is an innuendo only sexual in english ? 
  in german it is used as `` allusion , hint , reference '' . 
  i try to translate some catchphrases if needed - see descriptions of the pics . 
  something happened to 3-5 , the rest is ok . 
  the `` partei '' is a project of the satirical newspaper `` titanic '' , and some of their demands are : * only one year of higher education * build a wall ( around switzerland ) * make a show trial for merkel ( like mubarak or saddam hussein ) * as an innuendo on the `` frauen-quote '' ( about 50 % women in higher economy positions or politics ) , they demand the `` faulen-quote '' ( faul = lazy ) i do n't think i am gon na vote them , but alas , maybe they will make the campaigning funnier . 
  as if we needed a * plot * to get rid of him ... 
  jesus/isa , maria/meryem , josef/yussuf and so on . 
  but : alexander was n't a christian - 300years to early . 
  agriculture = agora = field or open place horticulture = hortus = garden well ... is there mariculture ? 
  while in holiday in croatia , our host would give us macedonian tobacco for free . 
  a very tasty light ( from color ) tobacco for a reasonable ( very cheap ) price . 
  [ it is . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/wpz9bjb ) edit : still mercator-projection but alas ... 
  well , the name iskender still exists in the turkish language - i do n't think a turkish boy gets named konstantin ... 
  everything but turks apparently . 
  that 's the sort of people one should worry the most about . 
  would you please refer to the colours of the flag as `` schwarz , rot , * gold * '' , because , that 's what it is . 
  godwin 's law and stuff ... 
  hitler was `` ethnic austrian '' but somehow he was as `` german '' as genua once was . 
  you were as german as hitler , beethoven and queen elisabeth 's husband . 
  `` holy roman empire of the german nation '' anyone ? 
  germany : * the first university ever founded on german soil was in ... wait for it ... prague . 
  [ univerzita karlova v praze ( link to english wikipedia ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_university_in_prague ) * the german police forces fired about 50 bullets in 2012 . 
  2 of them on people ( none fatal ) , the other for warning , accident or to kill hurt cattle, 
  yea !, 
  came here to say that !, 
  it means : i know about ten turks or people of turkish descend , most of whom live in my vicinity , and i do n't know * one * american or canadian . 
  and if those turks define themselfes as european , even better !, 
  it 's not about what you think is right , it 's how i feel about it . 
  let me have my opinion , i 'll let you have yours and it 's ok . 
  even culturally , i like turks ( or their culture ) more than americans and canadians , sorry :-), 
  will work harder !, 
   but we must keep them `` competitive '' . 
  * make * , i guess . 
  so you are telling me by paying my taxes for 2012 , i single-handedly payed the equivalent of one polish guys ' part of eu integration ? 
  or maybe some meter of road ? 
  i think i should earn a little bit more next year , so that i can pay then hungarian next . 
  this is easily worth it . 
  edit : no need to thank me guys !, 
  edit2 : i just remembered my last vacation in croatia , i seem to have financed the screens in the local police station , there where little stickers on each screen `` sponsored by eu '' :-d, 
  do you really call him that ? 
  so , where is this border ? 
  and do islands count ? 
  where ever you draw this border , surely the part of turkey west of the bosporus counts ? 
  albeit only about 2 % , * somehow * , turkey is more `` european '' for me than usa and canada . 
  well , germany `` defended germany 's freedom '' ^ ^ tm in the hindukush-mountains in afghanistan - surely russia could see its existence threatened in ukraine . 
  shots fired !, 
  because romanian use of german loanwords and latin gramar just fascinates me . 
  actually the group with the fewest deviant votes in the actual parliament is the egp . 
  this may be so for the normal person or maybe a student , but a politician ( candidate for brussels , not for a greek speaking region ) should understand enough english to understand the point of the question . 
  it 's fine if he answeres in greek , that 's what the translators are for . 
  but in the time frame of a debate , to simultaniously translate all questions ** and arguments of the opposing candidates ** is very hard . 
  more like to the middle , so that * they * do n't vote right . 
  really ? 
  whole germany was shocked , but a few days later this * incredible * tv show host said something very stupid . 
  so that was that . 
  i do n't understand ? 
  that 's not fair . 
  we gave them three subs , they had only to pay two . 
  and the savings where about 4billion , not twenty . 
  what about johann auto ? 
  that 's not exactly what i meant , but thank you for the information . 
  i 've seen such a map for the whole of europe and aparently everywhere you find such sentiments . 
  my question was targeted at the oversea territories , and the crown colony gibraltar , the falklands , and parts of the uk in outer regions . 
  the uk/british isles look weird if you do n't draw the whole irish coastline ... also , what 's up with the colonies and territories ? 
  are there any segregational or partikularist movements worth speaking of ? 
  so would you call the period in germany between '33 and '45 `` adolfman empire ? '', 
  that 's what he called his girlfriend/wife eva braun . 
  afd does neither want to leave the eu nor leave the eurozone . 
  they want a slower , more democratic based integration and the poor countries ( greece , i am looking at you ) to leave the eurozone . 
  besides the frisian north , dutch actually has derived out of * two dinstinct * german dialects , `` old north low franconian '' and `` old south low franconian/ripuarisch '' . 
  [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/niederfr%c3%a4nkisches_sprachgebiet.png ) may illustrate it better . 
  says the turk !, 
   muvaffakiyetsizle\u015ftiricile\u015ftiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmi\u015fsinizcesine it is derived from the noun `` muvaffakiyet '' ( success ) and means as though you are from those whom we may not be able to easily make into a maker of unsuccessful ones . 
  in newer times this viewpoint shifted . 
  now the prostitutes are legit business-women ( if they pay their taxes ! ), 
  - the guy who goes to prostitutes is frowned upon , though . 
  hey , but at least we do n't have to pay 2000 $ fines , like the frenchmen !, 
  i guess nobody would ever think that . 
  go to other smaller subs and you will find the same . 
  think of / r/feminism or / r/mensrights and similar stuff . 
  for every one gypsy i see in germany , there are * three romanian prostitutes * five romanians who harvest our crops ( asparagus ! ), 
  * ten men who build our buildings, 
   i can see why this person would face discrimination  face discrimination  face, 
  well , it can have a negative point , if this point illustrates the situation accordingly . 
  arguably `` jail population '' is way more telling than other data points , do n't you think ? 
  yes , it seemed like a way to get more points for eu . 
  why not `` landings on the moon '' or `` nuclear warheads '' , `` oscar-winning movies '' or `` percentage of population in jail '' ... 
  yes , indeed . 
  in germany you just have two parties which do n't want the further eu-integration . 
  i 'd say just afd and parts of the linke do n't want that . 
  most of the german populus thinks the eu may have its flaws , but is worth it .
