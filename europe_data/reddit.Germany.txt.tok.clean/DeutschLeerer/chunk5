  this ad is * not * by the cdu or another party , it is by the bundesregierung . 
  has to be `` neutral '' , and should only encourage to generaly vote . 
  each party has their seperate posters and campaigns , with their respective candidates , paroles and stuff . 
  during the winter war , the american did it just like that - they sent weapons , but only after realising they would n't send those weapons to the russians directly . 
  is n't it more like * i arrange a party at your house and push you out * ? 
  this needs an own entry on wikipedia : population to mountains ratio . 
  if you get hartz iv ( about 335 $ per month ) the state additionally will pay for your flat , up to 400 $ for a single person and up to 900 $ for a family of four . 
  maybe they mean this ? 
  you have been banned from / r/moskva . 
  they just do n't advocate themselfes with his face as candidate , i think most of the meps will vote for him , if the situation/majority is scarce enough . 
  they even have the word `` tolerast '' , for people who tolerate homosexuality . 
  pretty extreme view . 
   ( nsfw ) but in a good way, 
  lol , in german google , the eu-question is autocompleted ** twice ** in different wording . 
  yes , please explain this !, 
  no , merkel promises imediate action , boycotts the local baguetterie . 
  bild 's opinion : `` a strong signal for peace !, 
  merkel-super-woman . '', 
  du ju really sink , that ju coult recognise a german by his writing stile ? 
  well , it * is * true . 
  it is very profitable for germany ( something 40 million $ in interest from the bailout ) and no , germany will drive the eu integration further , maybe faster than a lot of other european gouvernments are comfortable with . 
  i will vote for tripras , because i feel the comission could need a corrective force , even if schulz gets elected ( since the left wo n't have a reasonable chance ) , this will be a clear message of `` take it slow '' . 
  they did boycot the referendum , did n't they ? 
  anyone informed about number of populace and effect on ukraine , in case of a mass exodus of refugees ? 
  i do n't get this view of '' [ white ] europe will get a brown piece of slush '' . 
  honestly , what do you care ? 
  `` your culture '' wo n't matter to you in a hundred years . 
  no irony , pls explain ? 
  well , especially new technical or scientifical things get named with `` fremdw\u00f6rtern '' , so its things like : computer , internet , handy ( cellphone !, 
  ) , operator - stuff which spread since the 90s . 
  you forgot : polish ( arrived 50 years ago with all the gastarbeiter ) greek ( for sciency things ) italian ( for cooking , like french ) and a few words from a dozend other languages , like arabic . 
  i bet that in 20 years we * do * have some more arabic and turkish words in our language . 
  even if you have decided to go to paris , here 's one more alternative : hamburg . 
  it 's not as far as madrid or paris and if you 're going with your gf , take her to see the opera !, 
  first a stroll on the [ elb-ufer ] ( http://www.falkensteiner-ufer.de/images/falkensteinerufer.png ) , then to the [ opera ] ( http://www.hamburgische-staatsoper.de/ ) , [ eat something ] ( http://www.hamburgportal.de/media/au-quai-restaurant800a.jpg ) after that and finally , go to the [ reeperbahn ] ( http://www.printart24.de/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x800/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/0/8/0867-reeperbahn-200x100.jpg ) . 
  for a portuguese , yes . 
  a tourist pays at least double ( or lives on a camping place , drinks water , eats noodles from the supermarket ) . 
  wow , that 's quite a coincidence !, 
  i like that they call this `` exercise '' , just like the usa did right next to iran , when there was a crisis in the region . 
  the thing is , the russian economy is about as big as italy 's . 
  and 30 % of it is with the eu . 
  i think we can do this longer than them . 
  also , nice time , now that it gets warmer , less gas needed ... 
  western media is more about to decide * what * to report , not as much * how * to report it . 
  i agree with you , though . 
  especially rt is for the lulz . 
  not even german ard , while connected to the gouvernment ( or should i say , state ) , it 's really something completely different from this russian propaganda machine . 
  no please no anschluss again . 
  we need a new catchy phrase . 
  how about we * liberate * you ? 
  fundamentalist for one side , hero of civil rights for the other side . 
  i actually have worked in/for his movement without better knowledge . 
  it was a teaching job in one of his private tutoring schools . 
  from what i was seeing there : the slogan of his movement is : integrate yourself through education . 
  follow the laws . 
  but also they had a room solely for reciting the q'uran and praying . 
  like sunday school for christians . 
  also , relatives of mine are 2nd/3rd generation immigrants from turkey : they are leftist ( read : anti religious ) and do n't like g\u00fclen nor erdogan very much - but would rather have erdogan than a ( more ? ), 
  religious leader . 
  it 's much propaganda out there ... so , no easy answer . 
  edit : read [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%bclen_movement ) and make your own opinion . 
  balticum = / = balkan first is estland , latvia , lithuania - latter the clusterfuck of ex-yugoslavia ( let 's see if i get all of them : albania , bosnia and herzegowina , croatia , serbia , kosovo , slovenia ) edit : macedonia !, 
  apart from your blatant naivity regarding money in politics : the adac is no union but a club for car drivers . 
  iirc aaa does this in the usa . 
  german afd too . 
   the 3 % threshold was declared unconstitutional 2 weeks ago aswell , so we will certainly see them in the ep along with a few more obscure parties . 
  really ? 
  i got the impression that it stays at three because 5 % is to high . 
  researching now . 
  you are right , [ source to your claim ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/drei-prozent-huerde102.html ) . 
  why do germans love the eu ? 
  maybe it 's because we can feel nice , like a good country this time . 
  we want peace and are very ashamed of our past - maybe that 's why we overcompensate sometimes . 
  it is nice to have borders to only friends and allies . 
  ok , switzerland too , but meh . 
  it is a glaring contrast to the fourty years of heavily guarded borders through your whole country . 
  now we have friends left and right and on top and bottom . 
  we can pay everywhere with the same money , can travel , work and live in soooo many countries , most of which are warmer and better for holidays than germany . 
  last but not least : you may have heard that the german economy massively soars within the eu and in worldwide comparison . 
  nothing of this wealth gets to the common citizens , but trickle down economy will surely fix this !, 
  / s just my two cents . 
  note , they are n't against the $ in general , they think it is a good idea for germany , just all the poor countries should leave and devalue their money , pls . 
  something important : they are nor with the efd coalition neither with another fraction in the european parliament , but run as `` independends '' in germany . 
  estimatedly 3 to 4 % would vote them , with the 5 % - hurdle declared unconstitutional ( it stays at 3 % ) , they almost surely will get some seats this year . 
  well , there is `` protest ( - marsch ) '' as well , but it is not as politically conotated as `` demonstration '', 
  [ three years ago ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/middleeast/15bahrain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) . 
  edit : oh , and it is sunday , 9 . of march . 
  well , the russians indeed say , `` kosovo is illegal '' . 
  furthermore with your argument , bavaria could choose to be a country again , and the german gouvernment could n't do anything against it ? 
  or this common , external * enemy * will weld the russian people together , and ten years after the sanctions , voil\u00e1 , czar putinovitsch . 
  i remember from another thread : * in england they traditionally vote on thursdays , apparently because friday was market day or something , so it was very practical . 
  * in germany it is on sundays , because you do n't have to work at this day ( read : the least people are working sundays ) and also because it is very handy indeed . 
  may be that in past times they wanted the church on sunday morning to influence the voter base ? 
  just a guess . 
  so , on which day does your country vote and why ? 
  i think that is a very important proposal . 
  maybe , instead of letting it get burried , you would make a new , seperate , thread ? 
  the question of `` british english or american english '' would spark some interest , i 'd guess . 
  you are right , but i think they would n't be free under the supervision of a pro-western ` gouvernment ' ( i.e. 
  not democratically elected ) either .
