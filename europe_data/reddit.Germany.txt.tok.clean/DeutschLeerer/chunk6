  lol ? 
  they * do * have the right to vote . 
  the election was moved from may to march , iirc it is on 25 . march now . 
  they just vote for more of an autonomous status , * not independence * . 
  the russians and many ukrainians would n't call it `` opression '' but `` peace keeping '' . 
  now they are forced by thousands of russian soldiers instead of radical neonazis and agressive maidan hooligans . 
  i can only give you another argument : the comment section on the tagesschau is horrifying too ... 
  i lived right next to an old bundeswehr workshop . 
  every few days , they brought some tanks to repair and mantain . 
  quite shocking to see some heavy transports with 3 or 4 leopard ii driving slowly through your neighbourhood . 
  if we are not going for everyone , we just could go for noone since eventually they are all dead . 
  this violates my sense of equality before the law . 
  as i said in another comment in another thread : it 's not about them being in prison . 
  even if they are charged , the trial will be `` postponed for medical reasons '' indefinitely . 
  it 's about sending a message . 
  you can insist all you want , but it 's up to israeli politics , courts and populace . 
  traitor or revolutionary , that 's the question . 
  edit : just saw your handle , are you boycotting the '' \u00e4 '' ? 
  you can only do this with capital letters : scheisse !, 
  or if you are swiss . 
  this would never work . 
  try to guard the borders to 19 nations and 66,000 km coast line . 
  nobody has time/money for that !, 
  it is more of a local grassroot organisation ( at least around here ) with very good contacts to other local/regional antifa groups . 
  fyi antifa is like anonymous , everyone may build up a group - some of them do good work , some others use the name for own interests , anti-semitic or anti-german propaganda or violence . 
  frankfurt did not get to be the capital of west-germany because russian troops could 've reached it in about an hour . 
  the border was between hessen and th\u00fcringen , afaik no 50km away . 
  yes , now . 
  in the new parliament they get 12 . 
  edit : see the original edited post . 
  the german one ? 
  strange that they got this wrong ... 
   why does croatia have 11 mp 's , the same as lithuania , when croatia has around 4.5 million citizens , and lithuania around 3 million ? 
  croatia , ireland , lithuania and slowenia all have 11 mps . 
  4,3 mio , 4,6 mio , 3mio and 2mio citizens , same order ... is it * time of membership * somehow ? 
  area ? 
  gdp ? 
  anybody ? 
  ** edit : ~ ~ i just have read wikipedia . 
  croatia has 12 mps for 2014 , the argument is non-existing . ~ ~ ** edit 2 : the page seems to get changed . 
  now it 's 11 again ( but shows 12 seats for 2013 ) and slowenia only gets 8 . 
  what is this sorcery ? 
  germans traditionally vote on sundays . 
  same reason : very convenient . 
  tips feudora ? 
  you forgot those brackets : ** [ feuding intensifies ] **, 
  you have the health care system to treat ** 1/10 ** of your population with therapy ? 
  that 's good news , in a screwed way ... 
  i wish we had this capacities , but no : wait half a year and pay for yourself !, 
  from what i 've read from you , i too consider you an eu-sceptic , but in the classical sense , not * against everything * but * critical * . 
  `` our boy adolf '' at least used * racism * in its definition : racial or ethnical affiliation , not citizenship . 
  it 's not about prison anymore , they will never see it . 
  in this old age you merely get house arrest . 
  if you ever survive the trial ( `` postponed for medical reasons '' ) . 
  it 's about the message . 
  the first thing you said , i second completely . 
  maybe denmark could compensate a little bit for the poor european economy . 
  second point : it is waaaay better for denmark to have this opt-out . 
  in case of a $ - crash they could de-pegg their krone easily . 
  it just states that the blame is to be shared . 
  could be 90 % to 10 % , i must admit but nevertheless . 
  this is common theory for english speaking historians nowadays . 
  the german historians still research and write about the * kriegsschuldfrage * on a base of `` only the reich is to blame . 
  and enough money and no family please . 
  also no ( radical ) muslims to appease the population . 
  could you please please please do this again for germany ? 
  i would gladly give another upvote for that !, 
  montan-union ol\u00e9 !, 
  will you shut up if i give you an upvote ? 
  it 's not england , it 's you ... to be honest : why do n't you * take * something out of the pot ? 
  seems like your politicians are chosing to not to do this , to manipulate the voters ? 
  so why all the hate on this sub ? 
  if you simply had read the list of contents on page 3 ( the first page with actual text on it ) of the ai-study you would have seen that on page 9 is every * tidbit * you asked for . 
  you may read the other study for yourself . 
  these two studies by [ amnesty international ] ( http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdf/mde150272009en.pdf ) and the [ world bank ] ( http://web.worldbank.org/wbsite/external/countries/menaext/westbankgazaextn/0,,contentmdk:22145826~menupk:294384~pagepk:141137~pipk:141127~thesitepk:294365,00.html ) seem to prove the opposite . 
  [ amnesty international ] ( http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdf/mde150272009en.pdf ) and the [ world bank ] ( http://web.worldbank.org/wbsite/external/countries/menaext/westbankgazaextn/0,,contentmdk:22145826~menupk:294384~pagepk:141137~pipk:141127~thesitepk:294365,00.html ) published studies about the ( unfair ) distribution of water between israel and the west bank/occupied territories . 
  both seem to prove that israel is activily shifting the balance to its advantage . 
  i just skimmed through but read something about 70 % vs 30 % in advantage for israel - while the natural supply by rivers and springs is factual in the opposite . 
  read it up for yourself and build your own opinion , but the statistics seem to be `` checked '' and furthermore , common knowledge ^ ^ even ^ ^ if ^ ^ they ^ ^ are ^ ^ told ^ ^ in ^ ^ german . 
  me too !, 
  `` is it der haus or das haus '' and stuff . 
  i like to teach and explain , but sometimes it gets silly . 
  [ / r/lanl _ german intensifies ] ? 
  synonym for `` most '' or `` typical '' i 'd guess . 
   hate me for who i am , not for who you mistakenly believe me to be , damn it !, 
  that 's simply racist . 
   hate me for * what i do * , not for what i am ftfy, 
   some countries have a military tradition that makes voters more or less pacifist . 
  moreover some countries have more interests in arms spending because they export them . 
  * cough * ^ ^ ^ ^ * germany * * cough *, 
  country yes , culture waaaaaay longer . 
  my argument would be that we need those strong , eurosceptical forces * in * the eu , to correct the course - not leaving it . 
  while norway is n't a member per jure , with the eea it is * de facto * - exempt for some small differences and special fishing rights . 
  you should watch [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ) for more information about this !, 
  i ' guess a lot of germans/europeans are ` still sceptical ' of this , too . 
  could you do this again , this time regarding the color patterns of the highway signs ? 
  germany is white letters on blue background for the autobahn , and black on yellow for landstra\u00dfe . 
  other countries must have this too !, 
  so you are from a southern bundesland ? 
  they `` pay '' more than they `` get '' from the l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich .
