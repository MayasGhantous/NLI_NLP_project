  no this just works the other way around . 
  just like hitler was austrian and beethoven german . 
  seats ? 
  in the parliament ? 
  that 's not what matters today . 
  every state has one member in the commission - so maltas ( 500.000 population ) and luxembourgs ( 600.000 population ) heads of state have the same position a germany ( 80.000.000 ) and france ( 65.000.000 ) . 
  i would call this over representated , would n't you ? 
  one has to commit that the commission ( at least now ) has more to decide than parliament , do n't one ? 
  sorry , it 's not political but just used in normal speech for this region of europe . 
  one could say ` adriatic ' , but that 's just not what we learn in school . 
  how would you call it ? 
  darmstadtium ist named after my hometown . 
  local patriotism for the win !, 
  i do n't get it . 
  if even , the smaller countries are systemically * stronger * represented than the bigger ones . 
  but financing is happening through gdp ... would you please explain how those three countries use their demographic power ? 
  this is a very unspecific question . 
  which countries do you want to visit ? 
  which climate do you prefer ? 
  wan na watch fjords and go hike and paddle ? 
  wan na cook in the sun ? 
  snorkeling ? 
  sailing , surfing ? 
  for start i want to tell you of [ `` le gurp '' ] ( https://maps.google.de/maps?q=le+gurp+maps&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;ei=a5xiussuosrbtaawt4d4dg&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq ) it 's a camping place near bordeaux , one of my all time favourites . 
  they will have the chance [ in march . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_local_elections,_2014 ), 
  i read a list of all the possible candidates for president - tsipras seems to be the only valid candidate for the left . 
  i do n't wan na vote for martin schulz , since he seems like on of this fat cats we already have enough of . 
  the iss will be decomissioned in a few years anyway . 
  2020 if i remember correctly . 
  to clear up the confusion : nobody is saying that we `` suffered '' from this war , i think every german would understand this , how it is meant : this war - even if just with planes and no troops on ground - was a groundbreaking chance in the german pacifistic foreign politics . 
  never before did we partake in an encounter against enemies since wwii . 
  all this happened with a green/center-left gouvernment , sparked up a hell of a debate and chanced the german conception of germany , its military and its responsibilities as major player in europe and the nato . 
  nobody is marginalising the death and suffering of the population in your country !, 
  peace !, 
  is it political correct to think this is a little bit funny ? 
  called * mohrenkopf * or * negerkuss * in germany . 
  first one is acceptable since it never was used as a slur , and if so , a hundred years ago . 
  neger is not pc anymore . 
  maybe in another hundred years . 
  kartoffel , erdapfel , grundbirne , bramburi , knulle - these all are words for * potatoes * . 
  so german has more vocabulary than french , or what ? 
  ok , slang for germans is `` kartoffel '' , maybe that has to be considered ... 
  lol , language a hurdle - really ? 
  i have a nurse in the family , he barely can communicate with his spanish coworkers . 
  most east europeans ( generally the older generation ) speak better german or at least english . 
  this is going overboard ... b2 is not enough !, 
  i admit , even at a1 you learn the names of the basic bodyparts and organs , but as * a doctor ??? 
  what 's the vierbund ? 
  never mind , just looked it up . 
  it 's `` mittelm\u00e4chte '' in german - never ever heard of the expression `` vierbund '' , not even in ap history class . 
  grrr ... 
  seems like bulgaria 's participation is less known around here . 
  [ proof ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/vierbund05h.jpg ) to use an old german saying : man lernt nie aus . 
  edit :, 
  i just thought about that and scanned the survey for personal questions . 
  it does n't even ask your age , so it 's less intrusive than many other ` surveys ' i have seen . 
  it would be even more of a debate , if he 'd come out * before * he ended his career . 
  there yet has to be an active soccer player to out himself . 
  in other sports ( hell , even in women 's soccer ) they are much further . 
  the german player [ steffi jones just married ] ( http://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/steffi-jones/steffi-jones-frauen-haben-es-leichter-34199794.bild.html ) . 
  joke aside , i think economically we compare ourselfs to china and the usa ( in terms of export capabilities at least ) . 
  sometimes with the eu as a whole . 
  afaik germany has 20 % of the total gdp in the eu ... edit : i wrote 40 % , it is 20 % . 
  yet in germany they seldom try to enforce them . 
  from what i get from the media , the situation is worse in the uk for example . 
  the difference between switzerland and germany was at least as big as now , though . 
  this map is strongly simplified and biased . 
  interesting anyway . 
  following towns and cities ** did have ** and adolf-hitler-platz at some point in time . 
  actual names included . 
  look for yourself if your city had honored him with that . 
  fun fact : some bavarian town revoked hitlers status as a honorary citizen [ * last year * ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/18/bavarian-town-council-revokes-hitler-honorary-citizenship ), 
   why do n't you go and find out for yourself ? 
  to spark up the debate and get people to comment about such an essential european topic ? 
  i want to rephrase though : why is n't lithuania member of the esa ? 
  are these two sputnik-like satelites ? 
  i know they are cubic , but aside from gps , a camera and a small antenna , they seem to have no other instruments . 
  this is more of a prove they can go into space - for the next missions , whatever they would be . 
  is lithuania member of the esa ? 
  no , what i meant was : the workflow is from east to west ( and from south to north ) . 
  who is harvesting asparagus and potatoes in poland ? 
  i 'd guess people from further east . 
  and so on , and so on . 
  i think even if we granted him asylum , the cia could snatch him waaaaay easier than from russia . 
  they did so before , and eu-leaders may have covered that . 
  [ source ] ( http://assembly.coe.int/asp/apfeaturesmanager/defaultartsiteview.asp?id=362 ), 
  i get him , in germany we have guaranteed * freedom of thought * but no real * freedom of speech * , too . 
  i see where you get from . 
  around here , nobody wants to do the field work , only 10 % of german workers will work longer than a week . 
  that 's crap . 
  so , logically , they pay people who will work the whole summer/autumn . 
  who are these people ? 
  east europeans . 
  i think we do n't want to make russia any more angry/concerned . 
  the trouble with ukraine trade treaty is enough for now . 
  that 's why kosovo is easier than moldova imho . 
  the whole of cyprus ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  turkey has to join first , to concede to such demands .
