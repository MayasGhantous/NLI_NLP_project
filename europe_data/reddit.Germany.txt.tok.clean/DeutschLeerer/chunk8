  and switzerland ? 
  they are * so * neutral , i do n't think they would join the eu . 
  to where ? 
  he is a spanish national . 
  * much fish to eat . 
  * `` mediterranean culture '' , even if it is not directly at the mediterranean sea . 
  * your language is like a mixture of spanish and french , with the mouth full . 
  * one of the giips-states . 
  do n't know how `` poor '' in reality . 
  * very hot climate . 
  * always thought porto was your capital . 
  * mother of brasil , and vice versa it brought much brasilian/south american influence to europe : music , capoeira and stuff . 
  i 've heard about * ch ` ti * , care to explain ? 
  it is a nice phrase to explain resentiments agains immigrants - quite catchy , do n't you think ? 
   i guess the [ they ] are seen as betrayers of our tolerance nice !, 
  mhm ... there always is / r/lanl _ german ... 
  [ you are right ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/germanic_languages.png ) . 
  but it is not only francian , but a little bit westphalian lower german , especially in the north of the nederlands . 
  not just that , but loving your european identity , culture and friendship . 
  exchange , travelling , working , living in an neighbour country or working there and and and . 
  that 's a wonderful description . 
  i can imagine this soooo good !, 
  even if you could ` buy british ' for the same price ? 
  could you explain that ? 
  when did germany go into * scary mode * the last time ? 
  i think many ` leftist intellectual ' germans have heard of volker pispers , but yes , he is not very famous internationally . 
  his rant is partly amusing , partly shockingly absurd . 
  many germans favour his kind of `` anti-amerikanismus '' . 
  you have to realize that this is aimed at the gouvernment ( which many americans themselfes critizise ) and not the general population , tough . 
  edit : i find him very funny and his kind of politisches kabarett is very eye opening , but may be a * little bit * exaggerated . 
  there are [ car alarms designed to kill people ] ( http://www.cnn.com/world/africa/9812/11/flame.thrower.car/ ) so why not an explosive device in a save ? 
  this ` rule ' may be helpful if applied correctly , but can discard any assumption or argument or theory of wrongdoing too easy . 
  * `` security agency x has ` lost ' several billion $ '' * `` oh surely it 's just incompetence , do n't worry '' edit : i just realized , i do n't need to refere to another example ... * `` palestinan ambassador dies in explosion , several minutes after he opened a safe '' * `` oh , surely he was just incompetent , do n't worry . '', 
  i think it is dangerous to apply this rule automatically . 
  this does not apply to anything related to politics , diplomacy or intelligence . 
  from wikipedia :  during the period of the ancien r\u00e9gime , starting in the early 17th century , * the royal standard of france became a plain white flag * as a symbol of purity , sometimes covered in fleur-de-lis when in the presence of the king or bearing the ensigns of the order of the holy spirit . 
   * the white color * was also used as a symbol of military command , by the commanding officer of a french army . 
  it would be featured on * a white scarf * attached to the regimental flag as to recognise french units from foreign ones and avoid friendly fire incidents . 
   the french troops fighting in the american war of independence * fought under the white flag . 
  *  the french navy used * a plain white ensign * for ships of the line . 
  smaller ships might have used other standards , such as a fleur-de-lis on white field . 
  commerce and private ships were authorised to use their own designs to represent france , but were forbidden to fly the white ensign . 
  the joke actually has some historical basis . 
  see it like a / r/whatif, 
  ok , in a case of external agression , i would guess that europe/nato would stomp it quite fast . 
  i was thinking about internal wars between the eu countries . 
  so , whom would great britain attack immediately , and who would attack her ? 
  a fine of 1500 $ the first time and 2000 $ the next times , iirc . 
  i will drink every tea except for fruit tea with milk and three spoons of sugar . 
  even earl grey . 
  condemn me if you please , but it is just yummy !, 
  it was introduced because old recipes for beer often included even more psychoactive substances than alcohol , nightshade and other stuff . 
  to control the drug ( and the population ) the reigning/established class introduced such rules as the reinheitsgebot . 
  economical and other reasons may have been important too ... 
  oh , that 's interesting . 
  like the polish `` nimiecky '' which means `` land of the mute ( those who ca n't speak our language ) '', 
  could you please give some explanation/translation ? 
  vokietija , what does it mean ? 
  i imagine something like `` land of the [ insert stereotype ] '', 
  2 % of land mass but 5 % of population of turkey is in europe . 
  i think it 's more of a societal or cultural viewpoint : turkey is very laizistic ( churchs and state are different , more than in germany for example ) . 
  also since atat\u00fcrk the country is very modern in comparison to it 's arabic neighbours . 
  ever been in istanbul ? 
  it 's like a typical european metropolis . 
  i think it is going to happen * before * turkey may join someday . 
  the principle in article 5 is clearly restriced . 
  ( i do n't argue this is necessarily wrong , it is just not complete redefreiheit , just meinungsfreiheit . ), 
  [ it passed but was declared unconstitutional by the highest court . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/28/world/europe/france-armenia-genocide/index.html ), 
  also hitlergru\u00df and hakenkreuz . 
  i do n't know if it is reasonable . 
  a few years ago some anti fascist was sued , because he wore [ this ] ( http://media.epochtimes.de/2007/03/15/20070315105719_deu_rechtsextremismus_hakenkreuz_bgh_fra110_pt_8.jpg ) . 
  after that the law was slightly changed . 
  the law regarding the armenian genocide was in [ france ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18758078 ) , i mixed that up . 
  it 's just the shoa ( and armenia iirc ) , denying other genocides is not censored . 
  but , additionally , every call for agression and the relative unspecific `` volksverhetzung '' are forbidden too . 
  we do have freedom of thought , but not freedom of expression , like the usa has it . 
  about = `` slightly less than '', 
  sometimes with `` schuss '' though . 
  i typically associate it with silvester . 
  do you mean `` german christmas markets '' or in general ? 
  maybe it 's a dutch thing ? 
  feuerzangenbowle is for silvester/new years eve . 
  weihnachten is all about gl\u00fchwein . 
  it is . 
  you do n't go to a ( weihnachts ) markt to eat good stuff , you go there for the atmosphere and gl\u00fchwein . 
  i was there with a boat tour ... it was rather boring . 
  a lot of cliffs ( `` highest cliffs in europe '' ) and water . 
  it got interesting when the boat passed between two islands , on one of these there is a chapel . 
  this church was build because 200 years ago , it ** snowed ** in august at this very place ... best part was the salt water sea on this one island . 
  i forgot the name . 
  but it was warm and very nice there . 
  if not for the other 500 people having the same idea . 
  while wandering through krka , i was very happy that all the things like fishing , swimming , cooking , smoking etc were forbidden almost everywhere - the place would be trampled down and ruined ... 
  i swam under the waterfalls , it 's marvellous !, 
  in connection with your french flair i can not not imagine you other than [ this ] ( http://www.theatrepeople.com.au/sites/default/files/images/monty_python_holy_grail_script_090_french_taunting.jpg ) . 
  oh and yes you 're right . 
  they are silly people . 
  mostly it 's your wooden shoes ... 
  that 's the opposite of what i learned in school .
