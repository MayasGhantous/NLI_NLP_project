  there is a rule that as colder as it gets , the extremities ( arms , legs , ears and stuff ) get smaller to minimize loss of warmth . 
  there are several groups of amish , but i think the ` pennsylvania dutch ' are n't actual one of them . 
  different religion or something . 
  also they do not oppose technology as strong as the amish . 
  [ source ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/pennsylvania_dutch ), 
  you are banned from / r/spainyang . 
  somewhere down there are the sandwich islands . 
  now you know the coolest of them . 
  i would like to take those countries to europe pls . 
  also the ( richest ) part of russia , west of the ural mountains . 
  asia can have the rest of it . 
  i did not research , that is what i have heard at a pub quiz though . 
  regarding andorra : while it is technically an own country , spain and france alternate ( biannual ? ), 
  in governing it . 
  andorra does not have an own gouvernment . 
  guys , i upvoted you all just because i was allowed to read your discussion . 
  * de facto * we have the grundgesetz as a constitution - * de jure * it is not !, 
  the grundgesetz was never legitimized through a vote . 
  it claims that the german people should give itself a constitionon though . 
  that will never happen . 
  when this debate is over , we will vote for an european constitution instead . 
  it amazes me every time : i buy water at aldi and pay more money ( $ 0.25 ) for flaschenpfand than for the product itself . 
  seems like every country has its texas ... 
  sez every province in the netherlands , i would guess ? 
  `` ost-friesen '' - jokes are * very * popular in an age between 6 and 10 . 
  then you learn that those groups really exist and stop telling them . 
  wo n't happen . 
  the german government is way to far up the ass of the us of a. btw , we have those laws . 
  but i dont think we would honor them . 
  meter and not yard . 
  since the exit polls are from 18h local time , you got informed pretty much * instantly * over there ( timezone !, 
  for germany : * http://www.meinpraktikum.de/praktikum/suchen?location=&amp;q=&amp;utf8=%e2%9c%93 * http://www.praktika.de/ * http://karriere.unicum.de/praktikum/ * http://www.praktikum.info/stellenangebote?utf8=%e2%9c%93&amp;q=praktikum&amp;location= and last but not least , the official page of the jobcenter in germany : * http://jobboerse.arbeitsagentur.de/ search for `` praktikum / trainee '' and enter a city . 
  may i ask which kind of job you search ? 
  until some idiot chopped down an oak . 
  yea , but the austrian navy is not able to cover all their maritime and oversea posessions right now . 
  easy to destroy with one attack - better build your capital in a populated centre , to deter nuclear strikes . 
  one could easily decapitate the eu with one small nuke / naval attack / raid on sealand - but even russia would not bomb a city of millions just to destroy the capital city . 
  [ for our german viewers . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5lrhd__teg ), 
  apparently it is `` samlag '' - to lay together ? 
  in german there 's `` beischlaf '' - to sleep together . 
  sweet . 
  fun fact : while the evildoers in `` die hard '' where germans , in the german dub they spoke in a russian accent . 
  mhm ... yes could be . 
  was to lazy to look it up . 
  while the second one surely is funnier , the first one is a real gory horror movie . 
  go watch it !, 
  please come !, 
  one of my buddies from the local pub is a girl from eesti , and despite her denying her viking heritage ( we had a huge fight about this theory of mine ) she is very cool . 
  imho estonians ( and europeans as well ) * do * integrate themselfes into german culture gery well . 
  not that other countrymen do n't do this ... it 's just that the rate is much higher for some peoples . 
  ( poles , for example ) . 
  what ? 
  why not mention the first one ??? 
  also , they are swedish movies . 
  i loooooove those movies !, 
  `` ehrenarier '' - * honorary * aryans - just like the japanese ( and chinese ) . 
  i get your point , i was arguing : * everybody * has to stop this or it wo n't work . 
   i have n't done the math [ ... ] well , that 's the flaw in your argumentation . 
  that would be like demanding of schleswig-holstein to stop fishing , since the oceans get depleted of fish . 
  you profit from it , pay the price . 
  i thought wodka was the polish product while vodka is russian ? 
  it was a joke . 
  while / u/yasenfire clearly cites the sith way of teaching/learning the might , my comment was a ( also slightly falsified ) quote by oby wan kenobi . 
  only anti-monarchists deal in absolutes . 
  o_0 that 's like : `` germany '' - do n't know that ... `` you know ... 
  nordrhein-westfalen ? '', 
  a miscarriage is a car of a train , solely for women . 
  you 're thinking of ** stop this shit ** . 
  oh , i thought the conclusion was : `` us sucks '' . 
  does n't he have to sign laws or something ? 
  our president does have to , for them to get valid . 
  \\* faking an american accent * shut up , indonesia . 
  yea , if all greeks come to hessen , we would have * double the gdp of greece !, 
  and about half of greek population . 
  oops , you 're right . 
  maybe i confused my `` indians '' ... 
  care to explain ? 
  does anybody watches this station ? 
  what 's broadcasted there ? 
  in turkey , turkeys are called hindi . 
  and that 's where they 're actually from . 
  germs from germany ? 
  some guy named st. cyril invented it . 
  there are massive differences . 
  check it out . 
  wiki or so . 
  see my answer to the other commenter . 
  i was not saying ` soldiers ' . 
  it 's not ` soldiers ' but ` personen im wehrf\u00e4higen alter ' , which includes medics , administrative personell , cooks , mechanics , drivers and so on . 
  also : javanse jongens tobacco . 
  it 's quite tasty . 
  if we 'd mobilize , we would have 15.5 million men and 14 million women in our army . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.laenderdaten.de/militaer/wehrfaehige.aspx ) for now we only have 180.000 standing troops . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/!ut/p/c4/dcmxdyawdatawvgg7unyaugc8kswi4omiestxxm002d8sewqy7jrstshc-4p94l0hencnxeguvxxsumkg8fwbd26td9uizit/ ) for estland the respective numbers are 213.000 men and 255.000 women , completely mobilized . 
  3800 members of their defence force in peace . 
  again ? 
  we already tried that , did n't work out too well . 
  and my ex . 
  to do that , you have to supply arms to * both * sides .
