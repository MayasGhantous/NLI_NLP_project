yeah but who does decide if there is `` a need to do something '' ... you ? 
  in this case , it was the government 's decision . 
  that bribing thing would only work , if they would n't get any other eu citizenship . 
  because - as you pointed out - bribing them off their belgian citizenship only for them to become citizen of another eu state and possibly even move back to belgium woud defeat the entire porpuse . 
  but who would take them instead ? 
   no surprise every kid with half a brain has or is about to gtfo for the uk , germany or the us if he/she can . 
  i get your sentiment , but i think the idea of bribing the unwanted to leave belgium would work a bit differently . 
  they would have to denounce their citizenship and i am pretty sure that in that case , they would not get citizenship in any other eu state , nor the us . 
  maybe some mena country would take them . 
  hm . . some ecclesiastical chorals , maybe ? 
  of course they should stick to their specialties . 
  i do n't want to see some monks rapping in latin . 
   sure technically they could have stopped the process do n't make it sound like this decision was a no-brainer . 
  after all , they needed several days to deliberate on a course of action in this case and in the end half of the involved secrataries voted to not prosecute . 
  only because the chancellor 's vote decides in a stalemate , merkel was able to get the decision her way . 
  as i said , i see both sides of the argument , while personally i tend more to the side that no prosecution would have been necessary . 
   yeah how about we just stop enforcing the law genius huffpo commentator the law gives the executive branch room to decide whether to prosecute or not . 
  it would have thus been completely legal to not prosecute . 
  of course there are arguments for a prosecution ( underlines the separation of executive and judicial branches ; international relations etc. ), 
  as well as against it ( underlines that there should not be a special treatment for heads of states ; strengthens the idea of free speech etc. ) . 
  as you can see , there were two ** legal ** options and no obvious correct choice . 
  hence the arguments you see now . 
  so , the huffpo commentator seems to support the second option more , not the idea to break laws . 
  the only thing that is for sure is that this law is horrible and will hopefully be history in the foreseeable future . 
   did you guys have your own reagan/bush years ? 
  i do n't want to blame italy 's situation solely on one person , but i 'd say that berlusconi 's career is at least a sign that something went wrong in italy during the last years . 
   so , you seem to be upset about actual bonafide syrian refugees coming to europe . 
  that 's an unusual critique , but i think i understand you now . 
  do n't put words in my mouth . 
  the wave of economical migrants is what is straining europe/germany currently . 
  and the stance on econimic migration is hard throughout most of the german public , parliament and goverment ( at least since last autumn ) . 
  so there is no argument here . 
  what i am talking about is that even syrian/iraqi refugees have to return , once the situation allows it . 
  you yourself have said that it is the current state of the law and that it is what happened during the balkan wars . 
  now , my critique is mainly that the image was created that this humanitarian act of providing shelter for people fleeing from a war zone is actually a form of permanent immigration . 
  which it should not be . 
  and the first time merkel addressed this was - you guessed it - january of 2016 . 
  i hope you finally understood what i am trying to get across . 
  this is still not addressing the discrepancies between what is the law and what has been propagated . 
  even if you say that merkel did not encourage anyone to come here , it certainly was perceived this way . 
  nothing you have mentioned so far shows how merkel has been trying to end the myth of her `` invitation '' and if she did , she certainly did not do a good job at it . 
  the first exception is - as i have been mentioning several times now - that statement at the end of january . 
  and no , citing statements that either have nothing to do directly with this situation ( i.e. 
  talking about economic migrants ) , citing the laws ( that no one read , certainly no one in the me ) or trying to make this argument into one whether syrians have a valid claim or not , is not going to convince me that merkel did nothing wrong . 
  those things you are posting were all about the influx of people from the balkans . 
  at least that was the main reasoning at the time , and it is now also being applied to people from the maghreb and afghanistan/pakistan or bangladesh . 
  namely , by reducing financial aid and increasing the amount of states that are deemed to be safe , it was tried to reduce the influx of people with ** no ** right to receive asylum or refugee status of any kind . 
  you could call this group simply economic migrants . 
  during september , there was never a statement from merkel or some of her subordinates indicating that people who fled from syria/iraq would have to return after three years ( if the war was over ) . 
  and it would have been contradictory to the frenzy about integration that she and the government were propagating at the time . 
  i distinctly remember statements from representatives of the government that the german populace should expect most of the refugees ( = syrians/iraqis ) to stay for a long time or even for ever . 
  while this may be true , if the chaos goes on for decades in that region , merkel 's statement in january is of a new quality , since the temporary nature of the shelter given to syrians/iraqis was for the first time the main topic . 
  ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/fluechtlingskrise-merkel-die-meisten-werden-zurueckkehren-muessen-14043375.html#/elections ) this would be a rough translation of the important part :  most refugees are only provided with temporary shelter in accordance with the geneva convention . 
  this shelter is - for now - limited to three years . 
  keeping in mind the efforts of integration , merkel also said , that the affected parties should be made aware of the fact that they can only have a temporary stay in germany . 
  `` we expect that they return to syria and iraq , once the civil war is over and is is defeated . '', 
  while it may be true that the clusterfuck of communication is mostly to blame on the media , it still remains that she did not enough on her part to correct that image , ** until ** january 2016 . 
  i remember that the media was surprised by merkel 's stance , since it contradicted the - at the time - current narrative of her being mother theresa . 
   `` there 's no upper limit to the right of asylum '' merkel is correct with this statement . 
  however , most syrians fall under the refugee convention and not under the asylum convention . 
  why she would conflate the two is beyond me , especially since she later in january 2016 clarified this . 
   you wo n't be granted asylum in germany - a lie you only get asylum if you can proof that you are individually persecuted . 
  for most syrians , the refugee convention is in effect , which grants a three year stay ( followed by a re-evaluation of the situation -  if the war is over in syria , they will have to return ) . 
  thus , the narrative that once in germany they have the right to stay for ever is simply not true . 
  merkel even said that !, 
  in ** january ** 2016 , and thus several months too late . 
  the afd themselves do not want to be part of the government ( yet ) . 
  and they are right , if they are ever going to have a position in a government , they should at first have had some experience in the parliament . 
   it was a punishment method in the roman army for units that committed serious offenses like mutiny i still think that decimating could be used here - even in the literal sense . 
  the main point of the decimation was - as you described - to punish serious offenses and discipline the unit . 
  if the left only achieves disastrous results in the elections , the main effect may very well be a change in attitude . 
  i think you can already witness that already , since feymann morphed from merkel 's lap dog to an integral part of merkel 's opposition in europe . 
  at least that 's how it seems to me as a german . 
   in rwanda they managed to kill 1 million humans with machetes and small firearms ... 
  in 100 days . 
  literally from one day to another people decided to go to their neighbours and kill them with machetes . 
   if they really wanted to make an european union , german politicians would have done federalisation during the 1970s , when the european monetary system was created . 
  german politicians want the eu to be exactly the way it is now . 
  yeah , that 's simply not true . 
  kohl himself stated that a monetary union would only be possible in conjunction with a political union . 
  this was in the early 90s , but the political union was more or less blocked by the french . 
  and this situation still exists [ today ] ( http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/web/rielcano_en/contenido?wcm_global_context=/elcano/elcano_es/zonas_es/economia+internacional/wp8-2014-oteroiglesias-germany-and-political-union-in-europe-france ) . 
  i 'm not saying that it is ** only ** france that hinders a true political union , but putting the blame solely on `` german politicians '' is simply wrong . 
   the germans must be literally brainwashed with guilt for ww2 in order not to see how destructive merkel 's policy ( lack of ) has been ** to all of europe !, 
  ** * but did n't you know ? 
  merkel is the only one advocating a european solution . 
  * this is something most people believe in germany . 
  mind you , most in europe do ** not ** support merkel 's solution and insisting on it has been destructive for europe . 
   the not all thing yes , it always surprised me when people use this argument . 
  * `` so we can not prevent that there will ever break out a fire ? 
  well , no need for firefighters , i guess ? 
  '' * that line of thinking is so retarded . 
  it 's still not as ideal as people try to put it . 
  let 's assume we have a migrant that is 20 y/o and has had no real education as of yet . 
  even if he is able to obtain an education in germany in ten years , this will most likely offer him a job in manufacturing or other low to mid-skill position . 
  for all the other , high-skilled positions you would most likely need another 5-10 years in terms of university , or be able to capitalize on education that he already obtained earlier in life . 
  anyways , the main argument i want to make , even if you are optimistic , chances are that these people will start to work ~ 10 years later than their german counterparts . 
  in the long run , this does not solve the demographic problem , since missing on 10 years of paying for your retirement is something significant . 
  and certainly not everyone will be able to enter the workforce . 
  to put it blunt , the age group 20-50 is the ** worst ** to immigrate , if they have no education .
