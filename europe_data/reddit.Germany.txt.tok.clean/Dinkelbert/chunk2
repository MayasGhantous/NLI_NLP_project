  let me elaborate : if you have people in the age bracket 50 + , you could cinically say that even if they will never contribute , you 'll most likely `` only '' have to pay them welfare for a few decades most . 
  if you have people in the age bracket 0-20 , you are still able to educate them decently and also influence their core values , which are formed during these years . 
  but in the remaining age bracket of 20-50 integrating and educating is harder , since ( a ) most people will not easily change their obtained values and ( b ) it becomes harder to learn new skills and languages . 
  furthermore , if we are again being cynical , if people in this age bracket remain unemployed , you 'll have to support them up to 50 years . 
  but still , if these people remain here , you are right that we will have to try to integrate them regardless . 
  it 's comparable to the australian model , which is rough and produces ugly images , but works in that it reduced the influx significantly . 
  setting up huge camps on some greek and italian islands deporting anyone without a valid and already accepted asylum claim to those camps might do the trick . 
  but again , it would be harsh - at first . 
  there 's a saying : * the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
  i 'm only waiting for the raising taxes and reduction in social benefits that will inevitably come . 
  i would be happy about that , if i could experience the reaction of those smug moralists telling me that `` it would cost only a tiny fraction of the tax income and that * they * are willing to contribute that '' . 
  but i am realistic , when the taxes are raised and the welfare system bludgeoned , those guys will remain silent or blame the evil corporations . 
  this entire situation warrants a max liebermann quote : * i can not eat as much as i would like to vomit . 
  the parent comment you answered to is - of course - wrong . 
  but there is a point to be made that the nsdap can not be simply put on the normal left-right axis , since there also was a labour movement within the party ( i.e. 
  gregor strasser or ernst r\u00f6hm , both eventually marginalized/killed by hitler ) . 
  there is a reason why fascism/nazism was often referred to as third alternative to capitalism/liberalism and socialism/communism . 
  this is also one reason , why it is better to expand the definition by another axis , libertarian < -  authoritarian . 
  that 's what the [ political compass ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/ ) tries to achieve . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/axeswithnames.gif ) is an example . 
  ( `` we will handle this ! '' ) . 
  a joke currently is to change her mantra to `` wir sind geschafft !, 
  '' , which would be translated to something like `` we are on the ropes ! '', 
   i still have n't seen a conclusive plan what happens when the quota is reached . 
  also just funneling people through to germany is not a solution . 
  this is the typical argument being used against people like seehofer demanding a maximum quota of 200k/year . 
  however , even merkel has said that the number of migrants has to be lower this year than last year ( which was at around 1million ) . 
  at the same time , she always spouts that having a maximum quota is not a solution . 
  but in reality , the declaration to reduce the numbers is nothing but a quota , which is somewhere below 1million . 
  and if you want to know the details of how to keep the number below a certain quota , then do n't make the mistake to believe that nothing will be done to hinder migration , and once the quota is reached , every new arrival will be shot at the border ( this being hyperbole of course ) . 
  what they are trying to do , is to make it more and more difficult to reach germany . 
  but if merkel would signal conclusively to the governments on the balkans that she will not accept more migrants than number ** x ** , then all the reinforced borders between the balkan states would close within a few weeks , since only few of those states want migrants accumulating on their turf . 
  of course , this would be ugly at first , and eventually you 'd get an accumulation of migrants in greece . 
  but once it is clear for everyone that there is nothing more than a ( secure ) life in a camp in greece , no one will pay thousands of dollars to get , what they already have in turkey . 
  in consequence , this would be similar to the australian solution , which worked , albeit it will generate ugly pictures . 
  but it seems that merkel is sending contradictory signals to her european partners , at least that 's what the austrians are accusing her of . 
  tbh , germany was lucky in that regard . 
  there were several attempted attacks ( [ sauerlandzelle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_bomb_plot_in_germany ) , [ kofferbomber ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_german_train_bombing_plot ) ) , then there were several terror warnings within the last months ( in [ hannover ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/germany-terror-alert-horrific-hanover-6860636 ) and [ munich ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12077040/munich-terror-alert-train-stations-evacuated.html ) ) that we know of . 
  furthermore , some of the terrorists involved in the [ 9/11 attacks started their radicalization in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohamed_atta#germany ) . 
  so let 's not pretend that everything is peachy , because it is n't . 
  the bertelsmann-stiftung more than once does polls with these stupid questions . 
  iirc , they once asked whether people are in favour of a `` fair/just education system '' . 
  they got an approval somewhere between 80-90 % and used this number to argue that the german populace was in favour of a school system constisting of comprehensive schools . 
  there were plans ( look up operation unthinkable ) . 
  the main problem was , though , that the ussr would win any conventional war in europe at that point . 
  and when it comes to nukes , you have to keep in mind that they were not being mass produced , yet . 
  so , if the allies attacked the ussr by the end of 1945 , you would have started a war that could not be won conventionally and you might nuke a soviet city every other month ( which would anger the soviets , but not change the outcome of the war ) , until europe completely falls under soviet rule . 
  then even the deployment of nukes becomes a problem , since there were no icbms or intercontinental bombers , yet . 
  at least you can vote for them . 
  do n't let the austrians off the hook . 
  [ say that again .

   the walking debt : deutsche bank edition i think this is better . 
  one of the good things west germany should adopt from the former gdr was their stance on child care and working mothers . 
  you could categorize the stances of the eu member states in three or four categories : 1 . 
  the moralists ( germany and sweden ( at least until they closed their borders ) were nearly indifferently taking anyone in who screamed `` asylum '' and scolding anyone who opposes such a policy ) . 
  the observers ( most of weu , they are actually sceptic , evidenced by only offering symbolic help , such as taking in a few thousand refugees over the course of the next years . 
  but since they are not directly affected , they keep mostly silent ) . 
  the border countries ( these includes countries on the balkan route and to a lesser extent italy or spain ; they take the brunt of the migrant load , but since there is no redistribution , they just funnel them to germany/sweden , since it is the destination of most migrants anyway . 
  they want ** a ** european solution , being a redistribution model , or a closed border model , but in any case , they want european support in enacting this ) . 
  the critics ( mostly v4 and others , critical much like the observers or border countries , they are sceptical of the migrant influx . 
  but in contrast to the observers , they openly criticize the current migration policy and favor strict border controls and in contrast to the border countries are not in such a need of european support when it comes to handle the migrant flux ) . 
  of course this is not 100 % accurate and does not delve deeper into the different political trends within the member states . 
  however , ironically the moralists are the biggest obstacle in enacting a european solution ( = closing the european borders ) . 
  and now they ( = germany ) are trying to get turkey doing the dirty work for them . 
   i 'm not following . 
  why would n't it work ? 
  a europe-wide solution does n't necessarily imply taking in lots of people and doing redistribution , if that 's what you 're concerned about . 
  `` european solution '' is at this point synonymous with merkel 's `` redistribution plan with a little more border control '' . 
  but you are correct , currently the only european solution i would expect is to close the borders ( be it greece or somewhere on the balkans ) . 
  let 's pretend that we speak english due to the british empire ... 
  this way , we can still be smug about our superior european culture . 
  well , even merkel is aware that time is running out for her . 
  if she is not able to noticably slow down the influx of migrants within the coming months , her policy has failed . 
   if you do i consistently it will fix the problem . 
  exhibit a : australia . 
  say what you want about what they have done , but you can not ignore the fact that it eased the situation . 
   the current minister of interior is from merkel 's party , same as the guy who 's vin charge of finance . 
  both of these guys are not exactly happy with merkel 's policy , though . 
  since they are part of the government , they do not openly criticize her , but there have been incidents where they have been pretty critical of her ( mostly in autumn of last year ) . 
  heck , merkel even tried to disempower the current minister of interior last autumn , but failed because of other parts of her party protesting against it . 
  this power struggle was national news . 
  i 'm not stating that they are guilty . 
  but it underlines that the legal aspect of merkel 's decision is not as clear as most people claim . 
  in the end , the courts will have to settle this . 
   which point out that he talks out of his ass . 
   sorry but this is absolute bollocks . 
  okay . 
  so i should instead believe you , who gives no sources at all rather than an expert involved in that field during the last decades , who in his books references everything he claims and also shows how he calculated everything . 
  granted , he is an enthusiast and probably could be judged as being optimistic , but i 'll give him still more credibility about his claims than a random guy on the internet . 
   how dare a democratic government making decisions for its electorate . 
  well , it 's not like there are serious claims by former supreme judges that merkel 's actions should have at least been coordinated with the states , ultimately begging the question whether her actions were indeed constitutional . 
   any estimate is invalid because it takes into account materials which still do n't exist . 
  well , he calculated those costs with * current * technology . 
  furthermore , he states that the radiation problem is also being exaggerated , as the only real danger is due to solar flares during the transit . 
  which could also be mitigated by a water shielded panic room in the center of the spacecraft . 
  also , the likelihood of solar flares depends on the solar cycle , which you can more or less predict ( i.e. 
  fly to mars when there is less activity ) . 
  on mars you have the atmosphere to shield you , and you can submerge the habitat under regolith for further shielding ( btw , that is a way bigger problem for lunar bases since you have no atmosphere and you are nearer to the sun ) . 
  and all this took into account the radiation data taken by curiosity .
