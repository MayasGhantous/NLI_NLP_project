  for further information , read his book . 
  he addresses every point you are raising . 
   for 50bn we could probably send person to mars according to dr. zubrin , a mars program worth $ 30bn would get at least four manned missions to mars ( each having 4 astronauts ) . 
  if you have n't read it , you should really look into `` a case for mars '' by dr. zubrin . 
  very interesting . 
  it 's in an article of der spiegel , published on 30.01.2016 . 
  the printed version . 
  i am not sure whether the entire article is available online . 
  edit : found the [ article ] ( https://magazin.spiegel.de/sp/2016/5/142149732/index.html ) , but it 's behind a paywall . 
  she is getting psychiatric treatment . 
  furthermore , people ignore that it seems that she was sexually abused ( not raped , though ) by other men . 
  this is unrelated to the migrant crisis , but it seems that she is definitely a victim in this as well . 
  i could n't have worded it better . 
  and good for you that you capitalized on your political insight and made 300 $ . 
  ever thought about persuing a career as political commentator/pollster/journalist ? 
  these guys have failed miserably during 2016 and you certainly did a better job than these `` professionals '' . 
  well , brexit is just ~ 5 months old . 
  these things take time to sink in . 
  especially in eu/europe . 
  and there have been hints that an eu army could happen , now that the uk can not keep obstructing these plans . 
  i mean , the entire argument mostly boils down to the uk wanting to have access to the single market , but at the same time wanting to restrict immigration of eu nationals . 
  i can understand that the uk would like to limit the access of eu-immigrants to their welfare system , that 's sensible . 
  an example being that you only should be granted access to the welfare system if you contributed to it as a tax-payer for at least x years . 
  but you can not have access to the single market and ignore some of its fundamental rules that everyone else has to abide to ( free movement of capital , goods , services and people ) . 
  why not become the 17th state in the federal republic of germany . 
  :o e : we have more money anyways . 
  the circle of life . 
  i know , 
   but we have probably the best infra ** e ** structures in w. europe , for example . 
  that 's not difficult , when the rest just has infrastructure . 
  ^ i 'll ^ ^ show ^ ^ ^ myself ^ ^ ^ ^ out, 
  the [ old king - juan carlos ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/15/084d0f4c00000514-2911905-image-m-35_1421340612390.jpg ) abdicated due to scandals and age and [ his son - felipe ] ( http://www.counter-currents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/king-spain-photos_2.jpg ) is the new king . 
  he is more popular than his father . 
  it was still part of the ussr , it only changed from russian ssr to ukranian ssr when chruschev decided that it should be swapped . 
  this was no problem , until the relationship between russia and ukraine deteriorated . 
  i 'm by no means defending the russian way of acting , but there were still living a lot of ethnic russians on that peninsula . 
  that reasoning was also used by russia regarding the crimean peninsula , though . 
  as i pointed out , this all depends whether assad has the power to fight them . 
  currently , it does not look like assad is going to win any time soon . 
  and even then , he will probably need a few years to consolidate his power . 
  and by then , who knows how the world will look like . 
  sure , in some situation where there are only assad and the kurds left with sufficient power and will , they possibly would start fighting each other . 
  but currently both have more pressing issues and they share similar enemies ( sunni rebels , isis , turkey ) . 
  but it is as easily possible that assad would be content - albeit it being only due to his lack of military power - with getting the western parts of syria back under his control and leaving the northern and north-eastern part to an autonomous kurdish government . 
  you are aware that the kurds and assads troops do not seem to be too much at odds ( for now ) ? 
  the west got a huge hit in terms of moral high ground when the us , uk + allies invaded iraq on false and fradulent proof . 
  while saddam surely was a dictator with blood on his hands , the lack of a un mandate and the fact that the leaders of the coalition used made up proof , makes that intervention a preventive war/war of aggression ( not sure whether that 's the right term ) . 
  in any case , such an act would and should be investigated and punished by an international court . 
  that did n't happen and most likely will not happen . 
  thus , only some third world dictators in africa and maybe the balkans are subject to these international tribunals , making them obselete and giving other nations - like china , russia etc. 
  - every reason to ignore them , since they are nothing more than institutions puppeteered by the west . 
  the same applies to other un institutions by extension . 
  tbh , this year has n't really been that thrilling for the eu . 
  to be fair , i 'd also be excited about the future if i suddenly received ~ 800k $ . 
  there are several other systems , which are neatly explained by cgpgrey [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7twhjfhiyo&amp;list=pl7679c7ace93a5638 ) . 
   we ca n't sentence people based of the will to commit crimes . 
  uhhh ... depending on what crimes and whether you can proof it , yes ? 
  yep , what he is saying . 
  was n't meant personal at all . 
  dude , try reading for once ? 
  your statement  if they do n't break any laws . 
  vs mine  ** proof ** that someone is guilty , before you can put them in prision and  if those plans are coupled with the will to ** enforce these goals by violence ** , then yes - you can and should be put into prision . 
  so let 's stop this pissing contest , since you already wet your own pants before it even started . 
  tbh , i 've seen what you have stated on all sides of the political spectrum , being it leftists ( `` capitalism is evil '' ) , greens ( `` we will all die if they build the nuclear power plant here '' ) , liberals [ the european definition ] ( `` a minimum wage will destroy employment and cost the society in the long run '' ) , conservatives ( `` our society will crumble if we allow abortions/gay marriage etc. '' ), 
  or far right ( `` the immigrants will steal our jaaaaaabs '' ) . 
  that 's what i was thinking as well !, 
  yeah , i do n't know where you are coming from , but that 's not what i said . 
   did n't anyone ever tell you that putting people in prisons and murdering them because of their ethnicitiy or religion is generally frowned upon ? 
  being an islamist means by [ definition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamism ) that islam is a political ideology for you and that you want to replace the current constitutional order . 
  if those plans are coupled with the will to enforce these goals by violence , then yes - you can and should be put into prision . 
  islam is not an ethnicity . 
  as i said under point 1 : islamism = / = islam . 
  the point i was trying to make was that you have to ** proof ** that someone is guilty , before you can put them in prision . 
  and if you live in a nation that values human rights , then that 's the hard part , since actual islamists will not simply admit that they want to overthrow the current constitutional order - especially when they are put to trial . 
  although there are always exceptions . 
  please think twice before answering in such a ridiculous fashion . 
  unless you want to continue to humiliate yourself . 
  the real question now is : who are the fools , fanatics , populists and demagogues ? 
  not the guy you answered to , but he probably meant : unfortunately not the most serious , because the current attack - as it looks like - had no lethal victims . 
  meaning : it is unfortunate that during other attacks there were victims , who died . 
   isis is slowly losing the war in syria . 
  should remove a major nucleus for terrorism . 
  one concern i 've heard several times is that if isis loses their de-facto statehood that they will then resort to more and more terror attacks in western countries . 
   close all islamists in prisons or on some island the main problem would be to proof that they are islamists . 
  it 's like saying , we have to incarcerate all terrorists . 
  welp , they wo n't voluntarily go to prison only because you wish that they did . 
   in short ~ ~ the middle east ~ ~ saudi arabia is doomed ? 
   chauvinism is an exaggerated patriotism and a belligerent belief in national superiority and glory . 
  damn , those copyright laws have been extended to more than 3 millenia ? 
   since wwii , austrians do n't consider themselves to be germans anymore . 
  which is really convenient for them . 
  yep , but there are no germans or people speaking german there anymore . 
  and unification was always about uniting all german speaking peoples in one nation . 
  a valid exception would be swiss-germans . 
   also how would germans react to spending 15 billion euro extra on defense each year ? 
  even the budgets are irreconcilable . 
  in germany , the public at least has started to acknowledge that the military has been underfunded that last few years . 
  so increasing military funding was already on the table , even before proposing the eu devense union . 
   the eyes should be open and the ** ears must be visible - they should not be covered by hair . 
  ** so why is wearing a hijab on a passport photo even allowed ?
