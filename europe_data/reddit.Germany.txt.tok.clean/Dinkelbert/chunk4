  not that i know of . 
  but , surprisingly , i read a few years ago that if flanders became independent , that wallonia would rather try to become a state of the federal republic of germany . 
  at first i was baffled , but considering that wallonia would still have a lot of autonomy in the frg compared to the centralist french republic and that the frg is doing economically pretty well , it is sound reasoning . 
   make a place independent from state or local laws , so there is not interference with this . 
  when belgium had no government for several months , some people proposed to split the country into three parts : 1 . 
  wallonia 2 . 
  eu-city of brussels, 
  and we could save ta ... o wait . 
  the history of poland : if there is a world war - no matter what - we 'll get fucked . 
   have it in stra\u00dfbourg and have elsa\u00df-lothringen be a special territory !, 
  yes , and let 's call the special territory [ ~ ~ reichs - ~ ~ eu-land ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alsace-lorraine ) . 
  huh , never thought of it that way . 
  flawless logic ... 
   soviets were always claiming that they had been caught by nazis by surprise in 1941 . 
  they were probably surprised by how early germany would attack . 
  stalin 's strategy - and biggest motivator for the hitler-stalin-pact - was to let germany fight with the capitalistic western allies . 
  having the meat grinder of wwi in mind , most would have expected a long and costly war ( enough time for the ussr to modernize their forces ) . 
  stalin certainly hoped to have the opportunity to then impose his will on the weakened third reich and western allies . 
  what caught the soviets by surprise was that germany was able to beat france and the british expeditionary forces so swiftly . 
  although even then , there were soviet intelligence reports warning the soviet high command of operation barbarossa . 
  stalin ignored those reports . 
  the rest is history . 
  just picturing the ussr joining germany , italy , japan , spain and hugary in the [ anti-comm-intern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-comintern_pact ) . 
  history sometimes surely is weird . 
   and overall our future would be better under just one german , occupation do you mean with that that germany should 've occupied poland at once and not later invaded the ussr-controlled part in 1941 ? 
  just curious . 
  personally , i think the most likely entity to replace merkel is her own party . 
  if they keep losing elections as they have been the last few months , at some point they will depose merkel . 
  maybe he was refering to the car ? 
  does your car have no name ? 
  i call mine mercedes ... < 3, 
  i 'm wondering , how many people - give or take - tend to arrive at the italian shores annualy ? 
   alternativlos ( . _ . ), 
  - <  - edit : i know your feeling . 
   it 's germany , sweden and all those who are inviting immigrants hey do n't rope all of us into this . 
  a lot of germans were as surprised as you were about our government collectively going insane a year ago . 
  apparently more and more people have started to realize this , though . 
  classic mistake to compare european nation states with traditions that can be centuries old with states like canada/usa/australia that are based on immigration . 
  it 's apple and oranges . 
  maybe french people smoke cigarettes that they rolled themselves and thus it is not reported ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i do n't know , but the trope that french people smoke a lot [ does not seem to hold up . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita ) they are 62nd , below the us . 
  triggered ... 
   tax evasion , people do n't respect the law or their fellow citizens and then it 's the germans fault that greece is in an economic crisis . 
  the problem is , what can the politicians do ? 
  if they openly state that they want to keep - in some form - in the eu , they are seen as traitors ignoring the people 's will . 
  having another referendum with a `` remain '' vote might aleviate that , but then you get into the territory where you might as well vote about staying in/leaving the eu every next month . 
  keeping in this kind of uncertain limbo - what pm may seems to try , simply because she needs time to assemble a team of experts for the negiotications - is also problematic . 
  if this does not get resolved in one way or another within the next few years , you will have so much uncertainty which will poision everything . 
  that question made me really laugh , so oddly specific and then even in two iterations . 
  polandball comics leaving their mark on society . 
  yes , what islam needs is some form of enlightenment . 
  let 's hope that the new marines will help to plot a coup ... 
  but they 'll probably die to siege tanks friendly fire ... 
  is n't it already forbidden in germany to wear masks in public ? 
  or maybe it was just demonstrations ? 
  that 's football . 
  germany had a lot of attempts , but still lost . 
  eh , i just mute it and read the text . 
  still somewhat amsuing . 
  what did you expect from a german ? 
  a cheap joke about the netherlands not making it to the euro 2016 . 
  what did you expect , you did n't even make it to the bedroom . 
   i do n't get it either . 
  die linke is anti eu and rejects it as a capitalist conspiracy ... also , the stats seem to be from 2016 . 
  so , the afd certainly was a thing during collection of the data , how come that the afd ( certainly to be considered right , and not simply a splinter party everyone can ignore ) seems to be more pro-eu than say moderates like the cdu ?!, 
   i would n't be surprised if uk was paying eu even more money then they are paying right now and with having less to say . 
  eea membership includes free movement , the very thing the brexiteers want to abolish . 
  i do n't get the stats for germany . 
  does this imply that both , left and right , are more in favour of the eu than the moderates ? 
  also , do n't forget that the scottish might try to give indipendence another go ( with the aim to join the eu ) , leaving only small britian behind , outside of the eu . 
  a brexit might really start a nasty clusterfuck no one really expected . 
  i read somewhere that the us administration decided to act in the following way : forgive russia , ignore germany and punish france for not joining the coalition . 
   i think middle east and africa will have major ethnic/religious conflicts they are already happening . 
  isis murdering minorities in syria/iraq , boko haram targeting christians in nigeria . 
  the shitfest that is sudan/south sudan . 
  then there is rwanda . 
   frexit oh dear , what a word ... ca n't stop laughing . 
  do you mean the [ moon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_%28moon%29 ) , the [ asteroid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_europa ) or the [ chick ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_%28mythology%29 ) ? 
   the annoying thing is , if we do n't push for what we think is the right course , everyone says `` germany should go ahead , germany should lead according to it 's importance '' . 
  then , if we do that , everyone is like `` germany is going imperial again , we are not their colony '' . 
  that is something that will always happen to you , if you are at the top . 
  similarly , you can see people whine if the us intervenes as policing force of the world and how they whine if the us stays out of foreign conflicts and horrible things happen . 
  the conclusion to this is to not let your judgement cloud by what other people think , because there will always be whiners . 
  this is just speculation , but most muslims in germany are of turkish descent . 
  while there have been problems integrating them , they usually are more nationalistic ( i.e. 
  extremely pro-turkey ) rather than religious . 
  maybe that 's why they are less likely to become islamists . 
  furthermore , germany had a lot of luck regarding terrorist plots ( [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_bomb_plot_in_germany ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_german_train_bombing_plot ) ) . 
  however , we will not get info from him whether he acted alone or not . 
   secondly , they should be droppping migrants back there , which would actively reduce the honey pot situation . 
  and australia can be used as a precedent here , where it seems to have worked . 
   but it 's just not * legally * doable ftfy . 
  ready for duty . 
  am scientist and get paid by taxes . 
  thanks taxpayer . 
   the 6 will be just for the swimming lessons , the rest of the sports lessons can outweigh that . 
  i remember having had swimming lessons during an entire semester . 
  so at least the halbjahreszeugnis will get a hit in that regard .
