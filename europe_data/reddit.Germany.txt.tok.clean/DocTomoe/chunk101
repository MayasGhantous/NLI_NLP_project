  we have this joke about airports on the british isles , especially since ryanair ... : london northwest doubles as dublin east - so if you want to fly from london to dublin , just walk out if the gate for 10 meters and enter the dublin gate ... 
  local airports do exist . 
  you do n't have an international airport for every minor industrial center like berlin in the states either . 
  you want to tell me that teletubbies is not looking a lot like what you expect to see on psychedelic drugs ? 
   ... it 's the anniversary of locals watching . 
  actually , if they had only watched ... in fact , they cheered the mob . 
  to be fair , noone needed a berlin airport , and a country the size of germany is well-served with two international hubs ( which are , of course , fra and muc ) . 
  txl was everything berlin ever needed . 
  but hey , let 's shutdown all the airports near the city and build one somewhere about an hour out of it . 
  you mean that i coincidentally only met the bad apples up to now ? 
  yeah , likely . 
   but these repeated occurrences are statistically so irrelevant ( not even .1 % of the muslim world population have you ever met ) that it 's downright foolish to base anything off these experiences . 
  the point is that i do not live in the whole world . 
  i live in a relatively small area of it , and within this area , maybe 0.01 % of the muslim world population lives . 
  unfortunately , of these 0.01 % , 75 % of the youth is * celebrating * thug life , and acts accordingly . 
  it is possible most people i would meet in jakarta are the nicest people on the world . 
  unfortunately , i do not live in jakarta . 
  what i am baffled about is that you 1 . want to make this a matter of racism . 
  it is not . 
  it is a matter of threat avoidance , we treat obvious neo-nazis ( no hair , bomber jacket , springer boots , baseball bat in hand ) just the same - we keep away from them . 
  2 . want to make this about me personally . 
  it is not about me . 
  it is about repeated occurrences with close to the whole population , especially in larger cities with a higher migrant population . 
   we do n't treat individuals as walking representatives of their race in which magical wonderland do you live ? 
  i suppose you do mean the us ... then ...  we do n't arrest black people because statistically they are more likely to be criminals . 
  ... is a perfectly wrong information . 
  black people are statistically more often arrested , more often singled out for checks , more often and harsher punished . 
   then you have a serious misunderstanding of how statistics , patterns , and trends work . 
  have n't been beaten up by a muslim gang in two decades , actually , have n't been beaten up by anyone in two decades . 
  my statistics might not be accurate , but avoiding potentially dangerous situations and people works for me . 
   but that does not mean all muslims will act this way !, 
  the main problem is that once is coincidence , two might be also , but three is a pattern , especially if it is not limited to one persons experience , but something that happens again and again . 
  there actually are districts today where german police does n't dare to walk in anymore because the local libanese/morroccan/turkish youth will overwhelm them with pure numbers . 
   i mean does n't that sound ridiculous ? 
  it does , and actually , i do have a few rather friendly syrian friends . 
  however , after my experiences , and the shared experiences of my peer group , i am more than cautious when encountering a non-known obvious muslim , male , between 15 and 35 . 
  ( interestingly , older ones are mostly harmless and very nice people ) . 
  it 's not racism . 
  we handle germans that belong to groups considered potentially dangerous in the exact same way , for example bikers . 
  but i assume you have not grown up around here , so you probably do n't understand what a nice feeling it is to have a minor quarrel with a muslim kid at age 10 and suddenly all of it 's brothers and friends turn up like a angry wasps swarm , ready to beat you up - and more often than not actually doing so . 
   really ?!?!, 
  that 's pretty fucked up . 
  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/baugestaltungsrecht  it 's nice to know that everyone in germany is a stereotyping asshole , and that they all judged me based on people who looked like me rather than me for who i am . 
  i like that . 
  technically , that phenomeon is something you will find anywhere in the world . 
  look like a potential threat , be treated like a potential threat . 
  heh , i may not even have a red roof if all the roofs around me are darkish-brown - why should someone be allowed to put an orientally-designed building into a medevial-looking city center ? 
  that being said - of course the rule is used to discourage the building of mosques , because really , we ( = long-term germans ) tend to like things as they always have been , and most of us think of muslims as highly aggressive ( everyone who had contact to groups of muslim teenagers in his youth will agree with me in this case ) . 
   did i miss the news of terrorist attacks , honor killings or widespread extremism in germany ? 
  [ it seems you have . ] ( http://www.mpicc.de/ww/en/pub/forschung/forschungsarbeit/kriminologie/ehrenmorde.htm ) . 
  i consider institutionalized murder a major incident . 
  he extracted information and tried to sell them - why are we even discussing this ? 
  of course he is a criminal . 
   no , they need to write or translate their so-called unbiased article in english so we can all understand it . 
  cultural imperialism at it 's finest . 
  here 's a hint for you : reading and understanding english is one thing . 
  writing journalistic articles in a foreign language is a completely different level . 
  i do n't blame the language - yet , if too little unbiased english-language information exists , you need to spread out . 
  this is an official , nonviolent protest by center-right citizens , so they should be allowed to voice their opinion . 
  if you want to know how it looks if this would be a real hate thing , [ look at what we did only twenty little years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riot_of_rostock-lichtenhagen ) . 
   or an intention to topple the constitutionally protected social democracy of germany . 
  to be fair and unbiased , there * have been * repeated incidents of high-level politicians of the linke claiming to want to abolish the fdgr , which in fact is seen as a threat against the state . 
  the government to not issue the building permit . 
  this is often done for `` preserving the look and feel of a city quarter '' . 
  there is a reason why most german mosques are built in industrial areas , where little to no restrictions exist . 
  as he was able to write that message , probably not . 
  someone should tell them that burning german flags is not something we care much about . 
  this is not the us ... 
  ... unless it is sabotaged , and i know certain politicians who are trying just that . 
   because we just trust you guys not to use our police to oppress your people and that is why you would send us units , of all things ? 
  if i think of `` human right abuses at public protests '' , i think of china , iran , and the united states . 
  there is a difference in `` shooting a plane '' and `` shooting down a plane '' - intent to destroy . 
  it is very possible to damage a plane in a way that forces it to land . 
   anyway i think military equipment should be used during natural disasters etc. 
  technically , this was allowed already as so-called `` amtshilfe '' , and has been done extensively . 
  this will never happen . 
  the problem with english is that articles from english sources often have an anglosaxon bias and do not reflect what is actually going on well . 
  * nods * language-specific articles in self-posts with a small english-language summary , that is something i can get behind . 
  neither . 
  [ we ban third-world-country airlines if they are insecure and their planes fail security checks ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/list_en.htm ) . 
  i do n't see how an insecure european airline should be treated any other way . 
  in short : ** not sure if misanthropist or ryanair employee **, 
  actually , the situation is not quite like the bbc make us believe . 
  from 15000 portugese who tried , about 26 ( twenty-six ! ), 
  actually got employed . 
  mostly they failed the language barrier . 
  disclaimer : i happen to live and work in schw\u00e4bisch hall . 
  [ and a link to a german-language newspiece about the situation ] ( http://www.swp.de/regiobusiness/magazin/aktuell/art1164023,1575884 ), 
  this must be some setup for an elaborate monty python sketch ... 
   a smattering of software developers ( see silicon glen ) i work in software development , and do have a ton of international professional contact . 
  this is the first time i heard of that location designator . 
   we have no intention of being germany , i never said that . 
  i just pointed out your existing economic output is likely unsubstainable in the medium to long term , and the idea that this will rapidly change is unlikely . 
  only solution : as this is gross misconduct by the pilots to take off in such a fuel situation as well as the company demanding the pilots to forget about their first and foremost duty : security ** shut that airline down **, 
  a most fragile economy , as someone with an username hinting at anarchism and thus communist ideas will surely agree upon . 
  i am not aware of scotland having much aluminium ore . 
  bonn ... we do have all the necessary facilities ( including a plenar building we used for about three years ) , transportation is available ( airport and high-speed train ) , and it is relatively in the center of the eu . 
  why spend money rebuilding anything when everything is available right now and unused ? 
  if it does not produce much , it will become a country having a permanent negative trade surplus - and we have seen how greatly that works for the giips ... 
  so , with the fish population rapidly dwindling , renewable energy ... which is not something easily transportable , and you can not eat kilowatthours .
