  i am pro-europe , but anti-eu . 
  maybe what we need is an organisation that connects europeans without trying to meddle in politics - a circle of friendship , not an union or a federation . 
   then i realised i 'm extremely cynical and pretty much hate every german refreshingly honest , i like that . 
  i would be interested , however , why you feel like that . 
  happy cakeday !, 
  yes , we ca n't have a single currency - and we said that back in the late 1990s when the euro started to take form . 
  it was madness to begin with , madness , by the way , that was demanded from us by the brits and the french in the 2 +4 treaty discussions , to defuse what they called the `` german nuke '' , which of course is the d-mark . 
   in the us , the richer states give money to the poorer states , in italy , nothern italy gives money to southern italy and we germans to that as well ( it 's called l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich ) . 
  however , we do have checks and balances in place to make sure the poorer l\u00e4nder are not just burning the cash , and their own , thus making themselves poorer and more eglible to free money . 
  do we have such checks and balances on the eurozone level ? 
  then : no money . 
   then your banks would fail and your government would have to bail them out ... for a second time . 
  which would have caused a lot less domnestic problems for the government . 
   at the same time , the euro would fail because it would become evident that no one was willing to defend it . 
  cry me a river . 
  the euro is a tool , tools can be exchanged . 
  in fact , as the anti-germans in this subreddit do n't fail to point out , germany is an export-oriented economy . 
  a weak euro would have helped us transform from an exporter to the eu to an exporter to the world , thus easing us going back to a national currency . 
  seems like a win-win scenario to me . 
   offering peanuts to greece , asking the impossible in return and then complaining that it is getting the short end of the deal . 
  ok , so tell me : what exactly is it that we asked from the greeks that turns out to be impossible ? 
   [ chart ] what are you talking about ? 
  it says down left , in light grey on white : only male population . 
  that is about 50 % ...  the law does n't lie but not everyone is going to retire when it 's legal for them to do so , especially if they do n't have enough money to support themselves . 
  retirement is legal at any age - if you are a multi-millionaire , you can retire at 25 ... 
  the retirement age is when you have the chance to get retirement benefits . 
  which is a solid ten years earlier in greece than in germany . 
   saving the greeks = free money ? 
  as i see it , you are lending them money , earning interests , so they can repay back to you and at the same time buy german capital goods . 
  [ it seems giving them free money or loans does not do much good for them buying stuff from us ] ( http://www.een-bayern.de/een/inhalte/laender/europa/griechenland/export-import-statistik-griechenland.jsp )  albeit all the problems in the south it is nice of you to forget that the culprits of the crisis are the architects that allowed a system that would be so unbalanced . 
  funny , i do not recall a referendum on abandoning the dmark in favor of the euro - that is probably because there was n't one : it would have failed dramatically . 
  so , if you now work the line of `` the average greek is innocent '' - so is the average german , and ~ ~ we ~ ~ most of us refuse to loose our wealth on foreign debt . 
   finally , germany , as most studies show , is one of the biggest earners of the system , which you conveniently forget . 
  and your point is ? 
   it 's the obligation of the richer countries to help the poorer countries in the european union and that is fixed in law ... where ? 
  i do n't see how any richer country would have agreen on an union with a variety of countries who would become alimented economies forever . 
  * my * government has done everything to soften this for the greeks * by saving their asses * - and has taken beating after beating from * both * sides . 
  maybe it would have been easier if they just have had them slide . 
   maybe you should just tell them the truth , that is , that the [ 3 ] average retirement age in greece has been higher than germany since before the onset of the crisis . 
  only trust the statistics you have falsified yourself . 
  for instance , this chart only is about half of the population . 
  laws , however , do n't lie . 
  believe what you want , we see who 'll be laughing when the shit hits the fan for the us economy sometime in the next decade . 
  if i turn out to be right , i suppose noone will be laughing anymore . 
  people and governments dislike their assets being devalued by some freak in washington starting his printing press . 
  eventually , they will search for another large , militarily-backed reserve currency , and that most likely will be the renminbi . 
  ok , you do n't care about the risk to our economy and do care about the average greek . 
  * grins widely * oh , just you wait . 
  you got more than twice as much debt on your head than an eurozone citizen ... end eventually , you will follow greece faster than a cruise missile . 
  in the late 1960s , we called them jubelperser . 
  i wonder when they are taking out the sticks and start beating protestors . 
  hint : we do n't really care if the average greek is the most likeable person on earth . 
  we care about them having a problem that more and more becomes ** our ** problem , because our moronic leadership has decided to make it ours , and that this problem is a direct result of greece living way beyond it 's means for decades . 
  it is hard to explain to people who have raised the age for early retirement to 65 only recently why they should support a country where the age of early retirement is 55 . 
  heh , so the eu commission , the single largest civil-rights-denial organ in this hemisphere of the world , asks people which civil rights they like ? 
   germany was the first country to break the rules . 
  * quod licet iovi , non licet bovi * - in fact , while we broke the rules , we both knew we broke them responsibly enough not to cause a major financial meltdown . 
   juncker 's remarks are about the present , because germany 's federal elections are coming and the signs are worrying . 
  sure , blame elections for it . 
  france does n't protest because france is a tier-b , soon-to-be-bailouted country . 
  they know better than making policy against themselves . 
  i 'm all for it . 
  the sooner our `` i forgot the suitcase with 100k dem in bribes '' finance minister leaves berlin and moves to a position noone gives a fuck about , the better . 
   you completely misunderstood me . 
  after having re-read the original sentence , i am sorry for misunderstanding you . 
   resentment is growing - understandably so , but hopefully it wo n't lead to anything drastic so effectually we germans are only a step ahead , maybe specifically because we disliked the euro from the very beginning and - contrary to other peoples in today 's eurozone - have not been asked about introducting it . 
  the signs have been on the wall even then , but our politicians ( willfully ) ignored them . 
   especially after ww2 . 
  you know , now , that the vast majority of ww2 participants are dead , this is a bullshit argument . 
   same with finland , denmark and even uk . 
  we 're all taking a hit , but for the better and looking towards the future , we all sail this boat together , knowing that we 'll come out stronger and more united after we reach the shore . 
   are you trying to tell me the populations of finland , denmark , the uk or estonia are happily emptying their purses for the great eurozone and sing a gay ( in the original sense of the word ) tune to it , filled with overwhelming joy of what a future might be ? 
  we also have a study that prognostices an economic decline of 15-20 % of our current output - which is a hard hit , but it is manageable . 
  we had worse when we did our reunification . 
  germans and germany do not exist to ensure the eu project to succeed . 
  we live our own lives , and the eu is a tool to us , not a religion . 
  if it makes more sense to us to leave than to stay , we will . 
  sorry , i got sidetracked ... a large part of our population was very , very unhappy with the euro to begin with , and feels like they already knew it from the beginning . 
  our banks ( and many of our larger retailers ) already do run it development and drills on switching currencies should the euro cease to exist . 
  effectively , we already are in alert mode . 
  to us , the euro is mostly dead , and it is time to move on . 
  we have had a study by our ifo institute that at this point in time , kicking out greece of the euro is actually cheaper for us than keeping them in the euro .

  so , human rights apply only to poor people ? 
  hahaha , you should have read the whole sentence , it was only two more words . 
   you 're thinking too high level , i could make a simple `` clerical '' mistake and state mr.taxevaders nationality whom is actually german as swiss , singaporean or whatever nation i like . 
  sure you can . 
  of course that would be criminal by the laws of switzerland and would lead to swiss prosecution , which , as i have been told , is more severe than for instance the german one . 
   why does anyone put their money in switzerland ? 
  security , no-questions-asked no-hassle account access , general worldwide availability . 
  three very important things once you live in an unstable country like each of the eurozone ones . 
  so many questions on one post ...  why is it hard ? 
  mostly it is because every conservative party in existence needs a scapegoat faction of people to prove they are `` good for the original citizens '' . 
  in the us , it 's `` illegal immigrants '' , and in germany it 's alternating between people on social welfare and foreigners ( which naturally include asylum-seekers ) . 
  in fact , when we had massive neo-nazi ... [ well , it was as close to a progrom than you can get against asylum-seekers in 1992 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riot_of_rostock-lichtenhagen ) , politicians choose not to persecute the nazis ( who actually tried burning the asylum home in the presence of police officers ) , no , they choose to change the grundgesetz , our version of a constitution , so that it is almost impossible to achieve asylum status to begin with ( for instance , you may only apply if you have come directly from an unsafe state , which rules out any other transport than aircraft ) . 
  then , even if you have the asylum status , you are forced to be resident in one of the towns you have been assigned to , and to the flat you have been assigned to ( which is in many cases contrary to what we think of human dignity ) . 
  you may not work for the first year and live in a shithole . 
  many townships do not care about your situation , your kids might get schooled , but that 's about it ( and thou there is a duty for kids to go to school , more often than not , this duty is not enforced in asylum-seekers , thus only adding to the circle of no social contacts and litte to no learned language skills ) . 
  naturalization is by design very , very difficult , and nowadays forces citizens-to-be to pass a test that is difficult even for born germans . 
  the test does demand - and that is a good thing , imho - language skills , but lessons are not paid beforehand and are too expensive to be taken from the 250 $ of asylgeld ( of which only about a hundred are actually paid in money , depending on the town you are being assigned to ) .
