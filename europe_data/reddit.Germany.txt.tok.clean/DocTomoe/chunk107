  so was hiroshima . 
  this will be a hard road , no doubt , but by far not a catastrophy, 
  oh , fun , i remember ireland setting it 's coorporate taxes to a laughably small level , thus first parasitically depriving its fellow member states of the quickly-relocating companies , and * now * sings the song of us all being in the same boat . 
  i would help my sister out - for a little time , i would not give her access to continue her ways that led to homelessness or other desasters in the first place : this is what we do to greece : we have seen our sister/greece comming out of a situation of domnestic abuse/gross financial misconduct . 
  we will not allow her/greece to return to a known wife beater/gross financial spending spree . 
   we have all made mistakes . 
  germany is no exception difference : germany paid for it 's mistake itself . 
   oh , come on man , i 'm not a fan of wasting money either but that was a good cause , just like it is a good cause to spend money in keeping europe together . 
  it 's always a good cause when someone else pays . 
  when it 's you who is footing the bill , you might see it a little differently . 
   you ca n't blame the people from gdr for their misfortune of being in gdr and not in frg just like you ca n't blame `` southerners '' for being from a country that made bad policies - there 's no sense in punishing the population . 
  i do n't blame either group - but i also do not see why we should give out blanco cheques . 
  blanco cheques was what led to ww1 . 
   they way you talk , it 's as if you 'd be against the government trying to save people from floodings , earthquakes and other natural disasters , nope , those are emergencies where life is at danger , and which are not caused by the people who need help . 
  i am aware that you will now point at your politicians , you bankers , claiming that the average southerner is innocent . 
  well , the average southerner is the one who let it happen for decades , wallowing in many of the policies the higher-ups decided to make them soft . 
  noone is innocent when a nationstate goes bankrupt . 
  that might shock you , but some people have principles . 
  not giving your teenage daughter your credit card ** after ** she burned through your first one is one of these principles . 
  it it takes the world burning to understand that ultimately , * pacta sunt servanda * , then let it burn . 
   what about the germans living there ? 
  those were ** east ** germans - just like north koreans and south koreans are very different people . 
   are you suggesting that no reunification whatsoever would be best ? 
  i think we should have introduced a western-controlled puppet regime in the gdr , and over the course of fourty , maybe sixty years rebuild them , out of their own power . 
   where else would you rather spend that money ? 
  for instance , instead of creating unused-yet-superb infrastructure in the east , we could have used those funds to * maintain * infrastructure in the west , which is crumbling by now . 
  we paid for the east because we were morons . 
  it was three lost decades , and uncounted trillions in exchange for no industry , 17 million unemployed and the massive rise of right-wing extremists in their underemployed youth . 
  not to mention eight more years of the pear . 
  we learned that supporting second-world-countries ad infinitum does not generally improve their situation . 
   why do you have to make it look like we 're such a burden to you when we 're in this together and our failure also means your failure ? 
  ... said the drowning person to the one just merely able to stay over water as he pulls him down . 
  is this statement the headline of a news article ? 
  answer : depending on the definition of `` hot '' : not so much . 
  welcome to the simple fact that we do not work on the quality levels chinese workers do . 
  that being said : our wages in production are probably a lot lower than you think they are . 
  note that h4 ! = minimum wage . 
  well , for a lot of reasons , for example the one that laws we rightfully have not passed / the bverfg has kicked out come back as directive zombies out of the eu commission . 
  the eu is an antidemocratic factor when it comes to german politics . 
  why would we stay in the eu after loosing the eurozone ? 
  past figures for a future scenario . 
  people do adapt , and so do economies . 
  at first , it will hurt , if it will hurt more than what we are headed to now is questionable . 
   would be surrounded by countries in recession , unable to buy german products fun fact : europe is not the only market we ( can ) sell to . 
  the horror scenario of noone wanting our stuff anymore is wrong . 
  we did great before , we will do great again . 
   and decades of work toward greater european integration could unravel the eu is a tool . 
  a tool that has outlived it 's usefulness should be discarded and exchanged for one that would solve the problem at hand in a more efficient manner . 
  if the eu prooves to be useless and potentially dangerous , it 's time to shut it down . 
  in the case of germany , the rammifications would be people loosing even more confidence into the euro and the euro-creating party cdu ( which would naturally be bad for merkel ) . 
  yeah , right . 
  we have heard * that * devil scratching on the door for quite some time . 
  our current approach of burning money does not work , maybe we should try a new one . 
  [ no , it is n't ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ) . 
  germany has the same prices as the uk , and we have no minimum wage - it seems you are complaining on a high level . 
  not at all . 
  i hope that stays as such and we do n't crash our economy by paying for the south . 
  technically , they are nervous about us because we are supposed to pour money into the mediterranean sinkholes with firehoses . 
  maybe it 's time to stop doing that . 
  let it burn . 
  you sometimes need a wildfire to provide for fertilizing . 
  in this point you are right . 
  never write about german bureaucracy before you had at least two cups of coffee . 
  ... from what i see at the sources , it seems this is some kind of an overarching myth to boost french self-respect . 
  in fact , outside of french reports , there is very little which points at french tanks having had a decisive advantage . 
  amusing , considering this did not prevent them from being overrun in three weeks . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanks_in_world_war_ii#france ) : `` the french army preferred to fight a defensive battle and built tanks accordingly . '', 
  ok , let 's do this . 
  first : the german council of economic experts is a quasi-government organisation ( ~ ~ of which sinn is a member ~ ~ ) , and they are hellbound to protect the euro as a cdu ( merkel 's party ) project . 
  this worst-case scenario is somewhat tilted for political reasons . 
  second : [ read this guy 's papers ] ( http://www.cesifo-group.de/docdl/cesifo1_wp3500.pdf ) and [ articles ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/ecb-s-stealth-bailout ) ( this link is readable even for non-economists , and details his plan on solving the crisis ) . 
  sinn has the opinion that the current crisis did not start in 2008 , but before that , because the countries failing today have traditionally had a trade deficit . 
  when private capital fled these countries between '08 and ' 10 , the ecb allowed them to take credits at the bundesbank , over 300 billion to this date , and pay it over the target system . 
  this effectively was a bailout before the bailout discussed now , which - and that is even worse - was granted without parliamentary support and thus unconstitutionally . 
  sinn sees the bailout as a continuation of these - unsuccessful - practices and notices how this will eventually bleed out the german economy , leading to a more catastrophic crash of the euro than the one we are risking at this moment . 
  sinn is regarded as one of , if not the our top economic experts . 
  oh , we do have a bunch . 
  we usually do n't tell them , though , because of our eagerness to just go on with life . 
  but here , just for you :  how do you identify a french tank ? 
   one forward gear . 
  six backward gears . 
  three decades being pampered ( 50s-80s ) , three decades paying back ( 80s-today ) ... 
  i think it is safe to say they paid their dues ... 
  oh yes ... the solution to all problems : inflation . 
  not gon na happen without a major quarrel with germany . 
  rightfully so . 
  a growing numbers of cowards distance themselves from him because they fear standing too close to him when he gets shunned because his - very thoughtful - insight is not wanted by current politics . 
  reminds me of that old , politically incorrect joke : small peter has finished his abitur , but he and his class goes to paris before they get their diploma for celebrating . 
  when he tells this to his grandpa , the latter smiles , closes his eyes , and remembers . 
  `` paris '' , grandpa says , `` me and my friends went there after our abitur as well , we drank all night , we took every girl we wanted , and their boyfriends did n't even raise an eyebrow ... '' two weeks later , peter comes back to grandpa . 
  he 's lacking three teeth , his chin is broken , his whole body blue and green . 
  `` grandpa , you lied to me . 
  we drank all night , then we took every girl we wanted , but then their boyfriends took offense and kicked our asses . '', 
  `` well , '' grandpa answers . 
  `` maybe it 's your friends that are the problem . 
  you was there with your no-good hippies . 
  i was there with the wehrmacht . '', 
  oh , believe me , if the euro fails and we are suffering from it , we 're bringing all of you down with us . 
  we do have a mechanism allowing supranational influence into our legal framework . 
  surrendering to br\u00fcssel , however , is not something we should want to do , and thankfully , the judges see it the same way ( as prooven in many , many cases ) .
