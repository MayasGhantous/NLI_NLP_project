  we made the grundgesetz hard to change for a reason - it 's good it is . 
   it would be a shame if 8 judges would overturn a legitimate majority of our parliament . 
  it would be rule of law . 
  according to both common sense and [ betteridge 's law of headlines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ) : no . 
  i do firmly believe the judges are now taking their time after they have been pressured into a quick decision merely because they can . 
  a demonstration of power . 
  they will look like champions of justice when this guy dies from old age on his way to the gallows . 
   i 'm sorry i just do n't believe that . 
  ah , and here we are again , `` not believing '' in science . 
  what are your takes on evolution , big bang theory and young-earth creationism ? 
  science is not something you believe in or not . 
  it is an absolute . 
  just because you are uneducated about a topic does not change it 's validity . 
  actually , and bverfg judge will - and rightfully so - decide that you have every right to mutiliate yourself for religious reasons , but * your * religious right will not be sufficient enough a reason to mutiliate * someone else * . 
  in the end , while the legislative might give some input , the judikative will throw it out . 
  gewohnheitsrecht never trumps the basic law , and the right to physical security is one of those . 
  gewohnheitsrecht does also not relate to anything in the stgb . 
  not this article , but many which have been published recently , e.g. 
  actually , yes , the ban of k\u00f6rperverletzung is a law ( stgb \u00a7 \u00a7 223-229 ) . 
  what has changed ( and rightfully so ) is that a judge saw the practice of genital mutiliation as k\u00f6rperverletzung . 
  imho , the next and necessary step would have been to create an example by jailing the doctor * and * the parents to the fullest extent of the law ( up to ten years according to \u00a7 225 stgb ) . 
  but ... but ... it 's a ** jewish ** tradition ... ( yes , i know , the muslims do it as well , but frankly , we do n't give a rats ass to what our muslim population wants ) i consider myself a liberal/libertarian minarchist , i do not deny my people did unspeakable things to people of jewish descent - but i start to think they * want * to be hated . 
  i am sick of being bullied around with the nazi club . 
  your religion mandates the genital mutiliation of infants ? 
  well , maybe there is something fucking wrong with your religion ... 
  i do not give a full-face tattoo of a sperm whale to an infant because my religion mandates it ... thankfully , should the political arm decide to change the law , this will definitely go to karlsruhe , to judges which are more concerned with human rights than political reason of state . 
  actually , the pope 's preference for fanta is pretty well-established : http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/uups-et-orbi-der-fanta-faktor-a-626333.html, 
  uh ... we germans are paranoid about car theft , and if you bring this up , we will tell you it is * everywhere * . 
  it 's also become a bit of a meme where we could find our rides afterwards , but in the spirit of friendship between peoples , i will not write about this here . 
   i 'm 94.9 % certain . 
  in other news : 83,53 % of statistics are made up on the spot . 
  joke 's on you , it was * your * tea , owned by one of your nationals , transported on one of your ships , and destined for your turf . 
  * sings * it get 's better ... only that 's a lie . 
  you would be surprised how fast our surpreme court does work if it is an emergency . 
  in fact , they [ are rushing this decision to the 10 ^ th of july ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2012-07/verfassungsgericht-klage-euro-rettung ), 
  compromise is a bad word when a compromise leads to all of us failing . 
  if staying course and saving all of our butts means we have to reject a compromise , then so be it . 
   not that i think she should get blame at all for realizing that all major eu players stood against her on this one . 
  that 's like going to a kindergarten and ask the kids `` who wants ice cream ? '', 
  not really a surprise considering that this amounts to both exterminating the better part of german economy doctrine ( which comes down to `` spend money wisely '' ) and will not hurt everyone else . 
  in short : a billion flies eat shit - they ca n't be all wrong . 
  this is probably the most elaborate twisting of a post i have seen this year . 
  i never said we were taking one for the team . 
  i say if we had n't attacked the russians , it was only a question of time for the russians to have attacked us . 
  it 's in the nature of dictatorships . 
  ah , come on ... it 's not that the german-soviet subwar was one ruthles warmongering dictator against another ruthless warmongering dictator . 
  in fact , it was only a question of time one of our countries would have taken the first step . 
   first , you start by admitting that you are not giving money to greece ( aka black hole ) when the vast majority of the money has gone to banks , including german banks . 
  you are paying off the debts owed by greece to your banks so as to protect your economy from too-big-to-fail banks . 
  second , the money you are transfering to greece is in the form of loans ... 
  in other words : we are giving you a loan which you use to pay your debts with banks that chance to be in our country . 
  effectually , yes , we are giving you free money , as there is little chance you do * not * default . 
  you will keep spending like you are used to , because your population demands all the luxuries it had when your politicians poured cheap money anywhere . 
  if you claim you wo n't ... well , that happens to be what austerity is about . 
   germany should have relenquished its mercentilist tendencies and acknowledged that trade in europe under a single currency is a zero sum game . 
  we were foolish to get into a single-currency market with countries who could not deliver - that much i give you . 
  i blame kohl and his thirst for reunification voters ...  now , i think the only hope for europe is a clear roadmap to integration ... 
  i can assure you this will never come , mostly because the longer we are in the eu , the more we feel like everyone 's fool . 
  the german population sees the eu as a tool to enact laws that are against our constitution , and feels surrounded by a series of countries who try to blackmail us into submission , wanting cash , or simply do politics on our expense ( romania , i 'm looking at you ) . 
  again , many of us do n't see the benefits anymore . 
   this statement reinforces my point that germany can not cope psychologically with the burdens of leadership . 
  trust me , you do n't want us to lead . 
  you want us to pull you out of your problems . 
  leading means being empowered to make unpopular decisions . 
   the allies needed a prosperous germany so that the german people would feel secure in their futures and less prone to aggression those are the same allies , btw , who copied our ethnic cleansing , who were famous for their rape brigades in the east , who would let us starve to death in the winter of ' 47 , and who specifically ordered their soldiers to not even talk to our civilians . 
  that whole situation only changed when the soviets broke away from the alliance and france and britain started to understand germany was the only thing standing between them and the red army . 
   i can not claim to know what it is like to be german . 
  go on a three-day school trip to prague , look at kzs and places of atrocities for two days . 
  have a grandfather-type czech give you the `` german salute '' in despise ( we were 17 at that time ... ) when he notices the german license plate on our bus . 
  have redditors start to talk about the war once they find out where you come from . 
  the rest of the net is worse . 
  be forced to keep your political opinion about the middle east problem under the hood , because once you say * anything * , adolf 's ghost is pinned to you by your opponents . 
  those shackles will not be removed in our lifetime . 
  it 's just too convinient to keep them so we can be pulled off our feet ...  to say that you do n't benefit from it is actually an admission that you simply do n't know how to benefit from it or are unwilling to step fully into the spotlight in order to benefit from it . 
  well then , how do we benefit from giving free money , effectually the wealth we amassed by hard work and good trading , to black holes , who have a long history of deficits and no political will to ever get better ? 
  ( [ yes , greece , i 'm looking at you ] ( http://books.google.de/books?id=01obaaaaqaaj&amp;pg=pa207&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) ) if we burned those banknotes , at least we would save on heating in the winter ...  . never mind the mere fact that they would continue to be a vital market for you . 
  would you go to a market with buyers that do n't pay ? 
   more importantly , it is entirely beneficial to have a periphery that is not imbittered toward you . 
  they will seek partnership and stewards elsewhere and germany could find itsel ; f politically and economically isolated ... all because of its short sightedness . 
  ah , now we 're at blackmail . 
  do n't worry , in the end , disenchanted partners and stewards will return . 
  just do n't trust that we will then be as cordial as we are now . 
   you are right and i never suggested that germany 's support should be without conditions . 
  but when you ask a country to achieve in two years what you yourself took 10 to accomplish is rather preposterous . 
  so what would be acceptable conditions ? 
  what would you be ok with ? 
  time is a rather critical factor , and we did n't have ten years either . 
  we just transformed ten years ago . 
   no one in my country thinks germans are so stupid as to think that the two situations are identical and therefore the same medicine is required ( at least not in the german government ) . 
  i agree with you on that point - just ... time is pressing , and this now has been an ongoing problem for four years . 
  tell me , what would you do differently if you were in charge of greece right now ? 
   therefore , it is no wonder that those who are suffering might conclude that germany wants greece to feel pain more out of a sense of retribution and a threat to spain and italy rather than an achievement of some positive outcome . 
  actually , i am convinced that this is partially part of german politics , but certainly not what the average german wants . 
  what we want is to be kept alone and not be burdened with the results others ' irresponsibility . 
  actually , we all would be speaking russian . 
  be thankful we volunteered to be the puffer zone in europe . 
  ** edit ** : this post refers to the special role of the brd post-war , and not of the role of the german empire in ' 41 . 
  you know what ? 
  there 's a cutoff date for such things . 
  if not a big-ass meteroite had flattened the earth 65 million years ago , neither you or i would exist .
