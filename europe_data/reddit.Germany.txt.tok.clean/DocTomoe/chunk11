   those guys obviously are n't dangerous to society pretrial arrest has several functions ... one being the accused not fleeing while waiting for a trial . 
  well , they use industrial-grade vacuum cleaners usually . 
  which is , in this aspect , * uncommon * . 
  yeah ... one was done for sports and the sake of it , to show what you are capable of if you only try hard . 
  the other one just was to piss off the authorities . 
  a few clowns ruining it for everyone , again . 
  so , if you got house arrest , they put rocks into your home for you to crack with a pick ? 
  it 's the same situation as in turkey : only a very small part of it is in europe , and there are cultural differences . 
  plus , unlike turkey , they 're an economic timebomb . 
  sometimes , setting your own boundaries is a good thing . 
  we 're the * european * union . 
  we can always tell egypt , israel , or south korea that unfortunately , all we can give them is a `` partnership '' because of these boundaries , and that cover gives us a certain sense of security . 
  let 's not destroy our cover . 
  i do n't see kazakhstan being allowed to join . 
  note that i did not comment on the moral aspect of this conflict , but on the misconception that a moving line on a map means anything until the conflict is over . 
  territorial gains do not equal military success . 
  see * la grande arm\u00e9e against russia * the third reich against russia * us in the vietnam war eventually , there will be a turning point , and that 's going to be the end of this conflict ( and likely , of ukraine as the country as we know it ) . 
  edit : added a non-russia-involved example, 
   police had initially accused them of vandalism , a less serious crime , but changed the charge to hooliganism and asked the court to place them in pretrial detention . 
    the judges ordered house arrest instead . 
  sounds like the court was * lenient * , not draconian , until a final verdict is reached , at least . 
  with building climbing now having devolved into political stunts , i fear this might be the end of russia 's climber scene . 
  sad . 
  yeah , the dear leader says so . 
  we do n't * need * something , therefore it 's forbidden . 
  what else do n't we need ? 
  food other than [ bp-5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bp-5_compact_food ) ? 
  let 's ban all those k\u00f6tbullar ^ 1 ( and for that matter , all other food ) !, 
  saves so much methane from cow 's intestines , also no more kitchen appliances . 
  i 'm pretty sure we do n't really * need * music . 
  let 's get rid of radio and concert halls . 
  less electricity needed , and less transportation to concert halls . 
  the environment will love us !, 
  noone really * has * to shower with warm water . 
  from now on , only 4 \u00b0 c water is approved by the parliament . 
  no more energy wasted on warming water . 
  while we 're at this : why shower at all ? 
  let 's just go dirty . 
  so much water saved !, 
  why single out vacuum cleaners when we can go full caveman with another stroke of a feather by eu meps ? 
  [ 1 ] disclaimer : i love k\u00f6tbullar , and got reminded of it by your flair . 
  all those parliament members are housekeeping specialists and vacuum cleaner engineers ? 
  so , again , it 's only another regulation targeted against `` the common man '' . 
  good job , eu . 
  equivalent to a modern power plant running four hours in that week . 
  for all of europe . 
  for 1388888,9 hours of work being done . 
   the vorwerk is , of course , also bloody expensive , but then it 's vorwerk and your grandchildren are going to be able to pass it down to their children . 
  from having owned a vorwerk while also owning a dog : this is a very optimistic idea . 
  my kobold 135 fell apart after only 4 years . 
   the difference equals to the annual electricity consumption of hungary . 
  would n't call that insignificant . 
  either hungary discovered electricity only last week , or this is bullshit until i get some reliable numbers . 
  for instance , i would wager that vacuum cleaners are neglible compared to industrialized electrolysis ... 
  yeah ... if . 
  their highest-powered cleaners suck ( or better : do n't * suck * ) even compared to mid-range siemens ones . 
  us military conduct in me theatres , and the west-sponsored overthrow of the egypt mursi government . 
  hint : bringing democracy by shitting on everything these people believe in - and then financing the overthrowing of their new democratically-elected leaders after a year because we did n't like their policies is n't exactly going ti work . 
   breed 10 of their kind . 
  goddammit , adolf . 
  did n't we tell you to stay undercover ? 
  why do n't we start mandatory death penalty for anyone acused to do anything unlawful ? 
  prooving an accusation is * hard * . 
  seriously , i would not trust us security for reliable data when it comes to this kind of thing . 
  well , if your country is anti-liberty and anti-choice , you get to a country that 's less anti-liberty and anti-choice . 
  i approve that . 
  alright ... time to go fully `` outbreak '' on that neighborhood . 
  ... karma-grabbing image-series `` vehicle registration plates of europe '' in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  seriously , how often do you look at your passport ? 
  allies are n't necessarily friends . 
  not a problem . 
  we just produce them in china and export them from there to russia . 
   the supplier had changed the way they sealed the top to something impenetrable by the supplied straw , sounds a lot like [ capri sonne ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=capri+sonne&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=2pfyu73ifcbeofvfgngb&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=895 ), 
  i am anti-only-believing-one-side 's - propaganda . 
  i am also anti-start-a-war-with-a-potentially-unstable-nuclear-power . 
  / r/europe is snorting ukraine 's propaganda like it 's coke - hardly surprising , given that the original rebels were staunchly pro-eu . 
  russia is involved because the west claims russia is involved . 
  plus , for a russian diplomat , a trip to berlin is rather safe . 
  by definition , an invasion is one nation 's military getting into the territory of another nation without being invited . 
  this is not an invasion until you can point at officially-russian soldiers . 
  by now , it 's a civil war - mainly people of the same original nationality fighting each other . 
  there 's a difference between full-out civil war and a group of leftist `` anarchists '' turning protests into violent protests . 
  but the results still will be there , and chances are that even if the ukraine somehow survives this madness of fighting back against russia , it wo n't be the last conflict . 
  it took the balkan a decade to get * halfway * back to a decently-running system . 
  i do n't see the ukraine even close to being a candidate in a decade . 
  god no !, 
  we should not and * never * accept countries currently in a civil war . 
  you go and prove you can make peace while following the ideas of universal human rights , and then we consider you a candidate . 
  seriously , i 'd rather take turkey , which followed all the rules and have tried for decades than a country which has a `` revolution/insurrection '' every ten years and no economic weight . 
   the fact , that no one from so called separatists is involved into talks clearly shows who is the main enemy of ukraine . 
  yeah , because if you 're a separatist in dnr/lpr right now , you would easily fly to berlin to talk with two countries you have no business with , one which is your enemy and one which sent some support . 
  people do n't go to meetings that do not concern them . 
   when you 're forced to use gmail , outlook or any other free email provider to find work , you can operate your own mail server . 
  it takes some skill and funds , though . 
  but for that , you keep all your data to yourself . 
   and google docs or office 365 to write your own cv , openoffice/libreoffice is free . 
   there 's very little that 's optional about any of this , unless you want to shut yourself out of much of society these days . 
  but that is a viable solution . 
  in the end , you ca n't eat your cake and keep it . 
  you need to set priorities .
