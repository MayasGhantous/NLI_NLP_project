  ** edit ** i do agree that diplomats not paying taxes because of an oldish rule should be reconsidered . 
  i am reserving seats all the time without my id card , thank you very much . 
  and my packages get sent to the post office , where i am known . 
  no need for a national id card . 
   i am not a native english speaker , but i think everybody should speak english . 
  full stop . 
  ha , good luck with that kind of basta-politics . 
   i 'd like a newspaper reporting on eu issues . 
  what is going on the parliament , what are the debates etc i am sure we will have that once the ep has any * real * power and influence . 
   it 's a useful tool to guarantee everyone gets what 's their right . 
  actually , that sounds more like a threat than a promise . 
   `` hey , those darn americans made us watch stuff about a bunch of tough guys hitting each other and trying to be the best at sports . 
  lets get them back by making them watch our continent wide pop singing competition . 
  that will show them who the real sissies are . '', 
  well , at least we do not watch a sports that is mostly about tight pants and guys laying on top of each other . 
   our gays  your gays . 
   if you threatened to make iranians watch the entire thing , they 'd surrender without a fight same with the superbowl , the main game of the most boring sports after nascar . 
  actually , i like the russian grannys ... 
  germany has something like that with the personalausweis , but the readers are expensive , and there is no real use-case for it ( but querying flensburg and the schufa . ), 
  we have been assimilated into an us way of life in the last fifty-odds years . 
  frankly , i think we are close enough , i still would like to keep some of our customs . 
  do n't worry , we will never allow the turkish into the eu , it would be electoral suicide for the c-parties in germany . 
   the tax only makes the bonds slightly less attractive for those with capital who want to buy them - they pay the tax , what does prevent investors from just investing into countries that are not issuing some strange tax , e.g. 
  singapore or indonesia , or india , all of which are fairly stable , thus bleeding out the european bonds market ? 
   turns out there is a real cost and burden to society when it comes to financial institutions and their doings ( such as bailouts ) . 
  actually , there would n't be such a cost if we just let banks operate like every other business : if money runs out , the bank is shut down . 
  no bailouts , no `` too big to fail '' . 
  1 ma\u00df = 1 litre , in reality a little more . 
  but bavarian . 
  similarily : `` oi hoibe '' = 0,5 liter , the standard measure for beer . 
  seriously , i have no idea . 
  do you have a source ? 
  the brits will gladly notice that 1 ma\u00df = 2,113 pint , and love us ever after . 
  so the country is paying taxes on it 's own bonds ? 
  yeah , talk about bureaucracy . 
  becomming a failed state is not better than having a great depression-style event . 
  if i want credit from my bank , they demand a collateral . 
  they do not come to my house at gunpoint to get it ... 
  would n't that only mean speculative attacks will be reshifted to countries without an ftt ? 
  i can stage a massive bet against the euro in hong kong , or even in new dheli . 
  i still fail to see how a ftt would solve any problem we are encountering . 
   . but the article talks about businesses , not individuals . 
  excuse me , my greek is basically non-existing ( we had ancient greek in school for a few years ) . 
  nontheless , businesses ultimately are people . 
  businesses is not only chandris , it 's also petros , the nice tavern-owner next door . 
  will some people get the hard stick and be `` punished '' though they are innocent ? 
  unfortunately , yes . 
  but this - forgive me the term , as i find it tasteless myself - is collateral damage . 
  what is almost tragic is that the anti-german sentiments that have been massively televised over here , have led to many of us reshuffling our vacation plans , thus weakening your economy and your money influx even more . 
  maybe , with a rapidly-devaluing new drachma , at least this aspect will turn to the better . 
  there will be even harder times for greece before anything gets better . 
  you are facing a collapse situation , and i beg all the heavens you prepare yourself . 
  build small communes , deal within , maybe use some kind of interim money . 
  there has been an article around here about tems . 
  do not expect anyone to help you . 
  it 's sad , but it 's inevitable . 
   my point is that they will never accept austerity , they would sooner leave the eu altogether and put landmines on their border . 
  excuse me , but if that is the case , both nations/nation-like entities would be better off if they would just do so . 
  greece would - of course - become europe 's north korea . 
  where do i talk about invasion ? 
   or that tax evasion is a simple as flipping off the tax-man when he shows up or even better invite him for a drink well ... [ with a tax evasion rate in the 40 % margin ] ( http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22770&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=29345 ) , i would say not even a drink is needed . 
   hey , remember when germany had to pay war reparations after wwi ? 
  remember what that lead to ? 
  jupp , hyperinflation and a little later war . 
  the strategy to prevent this from happening again is : we prevent hyperinflation by forcing the greeks to keep their money together . 
  ... just something warm to retire to . 
  but actually , we have had enough experience in taking up a second-to-the-brink-of-third world country . 
  it did n't go so well ... 
  : the same media that makes you think we are all nazis makes us think you are all lazy tax evaders . 
  think a little about that ... 
  i see no punishment . 
  austerity is about living within your means , and greece has not done so for a long time . 
  now , if we tried to be punitive , we would probably start making them hand over territory . 
  i still would pay good money for a team soulcalibur-created beat-em-up game set in the late 19th century . 
  queen vicky vs. 
  the kaiser * drumroll *, 
  i thought like that , too , until i spent a few years in southern bavaria for studies and beer . 
  nowadays ... 
  i just want to go back . 
  never set foot to bavaria . 
  i 'm lost , but you can still save yourself . 
  please give me one point in time when the eu was a democratic construct . 
  ... ** edit ** : instead , i got a downvote . 
  well , actually , i still think english became the * linuga franca * on the net because it is a lot more primitive in it 's grammatical structure and thus easier to learn . 
  and then , finally , everyone will speak german . 
  ;-) seriously , us , i fail to see how that was such a horror scenario for you . 
  you must have tons of tourists where you are . 
   like kings i totally read that as `` like *** vi *** kings '' . 
  ok , so we have two different kind of taxes . 
  `` steuern '' , which go into a central budget , but can be used for everything , and `` abgaben '' , which are purpose-bound ( let 's keep the brainfuckery of federal , local and city taxes out of the picture for this point ) . 
  one of the major problems i have with taxes is that we have too many steuern and too little abgaben . 
  car taxes ? 
  steuern , nope , no new roads for you , not even the old ones repaired . 
  telecommunication taxes ? 
  nope , not used to build better infrastructure . 
  a fairytale tax just because they can . 
  i would have no problem with a defense-abgabe , or a firebrigade-abgabe , or a road-abgabe , or an education-abgabe . 
  it would give us some idea about what is spent for what . 
  but steuern suck . 
  that 's because there are two options : * keep the euro and live austere * ditch the euro and do whatever you want .
