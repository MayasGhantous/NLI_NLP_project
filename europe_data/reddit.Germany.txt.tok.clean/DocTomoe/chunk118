  one of many , and of those many by far the largest payer . 
  your point is pretty moot . 
   nuclear waste safely buried so many errors in only four words . 
  in short : nuclear waste can not be safely buried . 
  easy : because we pay the bill . 
  obviously , you have never encountered our steuerfahndung . 
   kick the shit out of france you have my sword ... 
  welcome to germany , where this seriously is not a problem . 
  if there is a medical need , and psychological trauma is considered a need , any doctor has to help . 
  i have not seen a single proof against my theses in this thread . 
  i get slam-dunked by teenage pseudo-liberal folks and a small but vocal group of self-styled transsexuals ( who probably are just the random plain-vanilla redditor with a cause . ), 
  and i just do n't give in a question of morality against socketpuppeteering and the downvote brigade . 
   i am the teacher , you are the student . 
  you are preposterous , delusional and generally funny . 
  you 're welcome as well . 
  i do n't see where this becomes a liberty issue . 
  as soon as the person is 18 , he or she may do whatever he or she wants in my book . 
  until then , this rightfully is the right of the parents to decide , or , as they both have given the right to decide to the jugendamt , of those officials . 
   and you know the pain of gid because ? 
  the pain of gid is irrelevant when it is compared to impairing a large number of lifes . 
  if you can save one life and have to shoot 100 randomly-choosen people in the knee for that , would you do it ? 
   how can losing a few years of development compare to the pain of gid ? 
  so now we 're comparing psychological anguishes against each other . 
  why is a gid-related suicide attempt any less desireable than a suicide attempt by a 20-year old who just got into puberty and has a very disturbed relationship life for it ? 
   but , their feelings should be seriously taken into account . 
  yes , if the results are reasonable . 
  the question is what reasonable is . 
  is it reasonable to impair their lifes if there is a 90 % chance of them not actually being trans and a 4 % chance ( 10 % of them being trans , 40 % of trans kids attempting suicide ) of them attempting suicide at one point in their development ? 
  and 1 % ( 25 % of attempts usually are successful ) actually dying from suicide ? 
  so for every suicide prevented , i 'd have to play god with 100 puberties and developments ? 
  does n't sound too reasonable to me . 
  yes , the 90:10 ratio i pulled out of my behind . 
  i will look up some study to find a reliable number of `` real '' trans kids compared to `` later homosexual '' trans kids . 
   you simply resume your normal puberty . 
  and have lost years . 
  so while your peers have a healthy relationship life , you are stuck in a grown version of a 12 year old child . 
  when they start families , you have developed enough to have your first sexual experiences . 
  when you are ready to settle down , there are n't many potential partners left , so you have to settle for someone less acceptable ... you will have puberty-related anger fits in your job , and eventually your boss will have enough of it and set you free for the labor market . 
  you will be laughed at because hey , got a boob job ? 
  at age 19 you were flat as a board , and now you got 38c , ... the problems will last until the day you die . 
   to call it a want is diminishes what it truly is when it causes a great deal of suffering in a large portion of the population . 
  fun question : how did transsexuals survive before your frankensteinish hormone puberty blocking chemical cocktail was invented ? 
   and yet , it 's even more cruel to force puberty on someone who is trans . 
   this is why , if a child requests it , they should delay puberty . 
  children do n't have a say in their medical treatments for a reason . 
  they do n't know the risks involved . 
  in the specific case medical guardianship is with the jugendamt , so it 's not his/her parents . 
  and the jugendamt has decided it 's in the kids best interest to learn about the other side before trying what seems to be a highly experimental and unusual treatment . 
   which is worse to you ? 
  having children that ask for it sacrifice a few years when they turn out not to be trans or to having children that ask for it sacrifice their entire lives because of gid ? 
  yes , because once you hit 18 , there is no way to turn back . 
  once you 're 18 , you will be stuck in your body forever . 
  it 's a little bit like a christmas present . 
  `` but i want it * nooowwwww * '' . 
  nope , you 're going to wait until you 're 18 . 
  main difference in your equation compared to mine : you see the single individual `` alex '' . 
  i see the general scenario , and that does involve many such or similar cases . 
  and to sacrifice years of life from several people to make one person not feel bad for a few years is cruel and unusual for the group . 
   you ca n't play with a person 's life like that in the event that she really is trans . 
  another point where we disagree . 
  if you have to negatively influence the lives of 100 people to save the one person who is trans , does try suicide and is successful with it , then yes , you can play with that person 's life . 
  the lives of many are more important than the life of one . 
  it 's a matter of causing the least problems . 
  and yes , starting puberty at age 18 * is * a rather heavy burden people will have for the rest of their lives . 
  how large is the ratio of kids who actually are trans ? 
  how large is the ratio of those kids who attempt suicide ? 
  ( you stated 40 % ) 3 . 
  how large is the ratio of those succeeding ? 
  how many deaths compared to how many lives that can be lived undisturbed by `` delayed puberty '' ? 
  as cold as it might sound , but it 's all a numbers game . 
   because not doing so and her turning out to be trans would cause more problems than the spiro would cause . 
  see , and this is the main aspect your point of view and mine differ . 
   no one is suggesting giving her anything that will change her body . 
  just anti-androgens to keep her body from changing . 
  i think that 's a philosophical question . 
   this is in the standards of care here in the us . 
  i would assume that germany is just as progressive , if not more so , than the us . 
  excuse me , but the us has less than stellar reviews when it comes to anything but same gender/phenotype heterosexualism . 
  we have open homosexuals as our foreign minister ( which kinda is an idiot , but that 's on another paper ) , who was progressive enough to introduce his husband on an official trip to iran , where homosexuality is punishable by death , and as the major of our capital . 
  looks that indeed we are a little bit more progressive than the states . 
  we have a long culture of transsexual people acting as entertainers , not as freaks in a freak show but as stars in revues . 
  while we do n't necessarily encourage transsexualism , it 's not as if we think of it as being of the devil . 
  in the case of gid , we simply are more careful , and as long as there is no indication of there being a problem , we do n't use drugs . 
  in the most cases , that is the right cause of action ( remember , do n't fix what is n't broken ) , and in the few cases where it is not , we can handle the problem later . 
  all studies tell us that the majority of kids showing signs of gid turn out to become homosexual people , but their gender readjusting to their phenotype later on . 
  so why start to pump hormones into a young kid for the off chance of him or her becoming a real transsexual later ? 
  if someone talks about suicide , he or she gets put into the psychiatry . 
  no discussions . 
  that 's actually the law , and a doctor can get his approbiation revoked if said doctor does not force the patient into the psychiatry . 
   so , my question is , what is ` gender related therapy ' mentioned in the original article , seeing that i ca n't read german . 
  the article actually outlines two different approaches : 1 . 
  the reeducation one , which is described as being a wishlist by the jugendamt to a psychiatric ward . 
  that approach is obviously flawed , but not to be taken serious , because frankly psychiatries are not chinese-style reeducation camps . 
  the jugendamt can wish what it wants , but that does n't mean that will happen . 
  hormone therapy , which we frankly have no ways of accepting right now for the simple reason i stated here again and again : we can not be sure that a gid now will irrevocably , and in the most cases , result in transsexuality as an adult , and we do n't want to change a person 's body for a legal battle or some radical groups . 
  as we have repeated that loop for three times now , by the rules of chess the game is over . 
  as long as you willfully misunderstand the reasons for the kid 's visit to the psychiatry , we 're done talking . 
  with your statements in this post , you disapprove of many sources cited by people thrown into my face ... it seems that there is n't really any common ground within your group , so why should i give your circumstancial evidence any credibility ? 
  just because ** you ** did n't change your mind does n't mean it does n't happen . 
  just because ** you ** are chronically depressed does n't mean that happens in 100 % of the cases .
