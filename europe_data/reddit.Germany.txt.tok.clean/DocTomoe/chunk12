  wanting to use services without agreeing to their tos ( or wanting the state to declare them unlawful * after * you agreed to them ) is just being parasitic behavior . 
   and for your information no , most of europe does not have strong privacy protection , that is a german thing and you are really uninformed if you think that 's the case . 
  another reason why - in the long run - germany is set up for failure .

  yay , destroying their agrarian sector . 
  because that 's gon na help . 
  that 's a wonderful way to 1 . lose even more money , because food needs to be transported and refrigerated and , more importantly , 2 . destroy the agrarian economy in those countries even more . 
  a lot of very scattered places ( camping places ? ), 
  in the vicinity of the netherlands and the alpine regions ( which is a dutch hotspot in germany/austria/switzerland ) , close to major highways , and the observation that 80 % of dutch vessels i see on the autobahn indeed have a [ trailer ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=trailer&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=z_vwu_uwoo7t7abct4gwag&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=640#q=camping+trailer&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  you travel a lot by trailer , right ? 
  merkel has sworn an oath to work for the best interest of the german people . 
  getting entangled in conflict with russia , which is one of our main economic partners , is * not * in the best interest of the german people . 
  i do n't like merkel , but she did handle this well over a long time . 
  no ... that only works when * she * has the fullest confidence . 
  dark merklic at it 's best . 
  can someone translate what is said in this video ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i heard an `` allahu akbar '' at 0:14 ... which would not make sense in the ukrainian theatre . 
  24 millionaires went to a third-world country and after only 7 games , some who were embarassing ( seriously , brazil ? 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ) consider themselves the best of the world now . 
  and i should feel better now ... why ? 
  because they wore a flag whose related nation-state embezzles money out of my paycheck ? 
   we already have that ? 
  in germany , you have the bundesdatenschutzgesetz , which is almost , well , fascist in it 's pro-consumer rules . 
  i am pretty sure it 's the same or similar in other eu countries . 
   if you mean the rights we give away when we sign terms & conditions , it does n't work in its current form . 
  that would be a contract made between two willing participiants , and frankly , you ca n't eat the cake and keep it . 
  you can tell from a grainy video ? 
  what is the specific difference from an 1994-era btr-80a ? 
  the original 1972 marder 3 is not used anymore . 
  nor is the original m2 from 1982 . 
  these are not `` modern '' vehicles , their current subversion is . 
   what 's your point ? 
  my point is that a third of the description already is wrong . 
  now , are those really insurgents , is this really filmed in the ukraine , and is that really a btr-80a ( i guess it would be easy to make a standard btr-3 look a lot like an btr-80a if you wanted to ) ? 
   as a citizen i find this whole situation great . 
  please remove yourself from the internet .

   the spanish man who won the court case was in the right , no . 
  the spanish man * would * have been in the right if he pursued the original source of the offending content , e.g. 
  the newspaper . 
  the content is not removed - it will continue to exist , and it will be found . 
   what we need is an electronic bill of rights , where we are allowed to keep the data that we provide to these corporations , and have the right to delete and forbid them sharing with third-parties unless properly authorized - each and every time they want to do so . 
  we already have that . 
  this does not apply to newspaper articles , though , and that 's a good thing , as it would infringe the freedom of the press - which arguably is more important than privacy . 
  is that a satire article or did they just re-enact * [ girls and panzer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/girls_und_panzer ) * ? 
  [ `` modern '' ifv ... in production since 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/btr-80#russian_federation ) . 
  i just do n't consider western/ukrainian propaganda to be any better than russian propaganda . 
  but i know , whoever is not with you is against you . 
   if you plan to show the public your trucks , why not show them trucks loaded with actual humanitarian aid , rather than empty space for potential soldiers to be carried ? 
  maybe they did , and the twitter folks decided to only show the `` reserve '' ones . 
  actually , this is best practice in convois , especially in a military setting . 
  hell , it even applies to aircraft . 
  when germany moved tornado fighter jets to afghanistan in the 2000s , we sent three times the number we actually needed there , two thirds to return pretty much immediately , because we feared them failing , being damaged on afghan runways , yadda yadda ( and in fear we wo n't be able to manage another flight approval with a douzend foreign airspaces ) . 
  `` all media is propaganda '' is hardly a conspiracy theory . 
  it can easily be shown that selective editing exists pretty much everywhere . 
  but i guess i 'd rather be a conspiracy nut than a 21 ^ st - century version of [ pollyanna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pollyanna_principle ) . 
  well , i pointed out that there is no independent media , that all media is propaganda . 
  you called that negativism , implying that it would be better for society if we would n't think like that . 
  which is pretty much `` lie to yourself about how great things are '' . 
  so they start to organize their humanitarian mission outside of a military camp ( hardly surprising ) , which also has actual weaponry based there ? 
  note how that trailer is * inbound * , not outbound . 
  you 're walking right into `` brave new world '' territory with that statement . 
  `` lie to yourself about the realities , because if we all lie to ourselves how great everything is , everything will be great '' . 
  again , what russian media ( at this point i consider all russian media to be state-controlled ) does is irrelevant . 
  just because your neighbor steals your apples does not entitle you to do the same . 
  that 's appeal to authority , and an example how most western constitutions are n't actually democratic . 
  infringed human rights , and free speech is a human right , are by definition undemocratic , and a constitution that allows basic human rights to be limited is as well . 
   russian propaganda is a revolting insult to any civilized society so is italian private tv ( seems it consisty mostly of scandly-clad future state ministers ) . 
  just because something is idiotic does not mean it needs to be banned . 
   if individuals wish to seek out russian propaganda for their own intellectual curiosity ; then all power to them . 
  but to expose the general public , most of whom will take every word the talking heads on tv say as pure truth , is socially irresponsible . 
  you are claiming there are people mentally able to interpret what they see in a subjectively `` right '' way ( = the way you see it ) , and the vast majority would not be able to do so , e.g. 
  be too stupid . 
  frankly , i find that view insulting . 
   [ fox news and bush pre-iraq ] do you not think that was immoral ? 
  of course i do . 
  and i see it happening today ... on ard , on france 1 , on bbc ... building up the fear of a russo-european military conflict . 
  they just are a bit more subtle . 
  do never believe we are any better than fox news or russia today . 
  we 're running a propaganda machine as well , and it works ( unsurprisingly ) well . 
  just look around how / r/europe beats the wardrums already . 
  well , you ca n't just ex post ipso facto declare agreement of the international community about the state of a territory wrong and consider the annexiation illegitimate . 
  the geneva conventions were finalized in 1949 - at that point , latvia already was part of the ussr for five years , so the geneva conventions do not apply . 
  the european union did not exist at that point , the united states by definition did not recognize anything the ussr did , the unhrc did not exist until 2006 ( fifteen years after the dissolution of the ussr ! ), 
  and the echr only gained permanence in 1998 . 
  so their opinion is pretty much irrelevant . 
   except that people dont tend to read/watch media outlets with differing view points and therefore the libel/slander will in their mind never be disproved . 
  but then their minds are made up beforehand , and by blocking these channels you will have achieved nothing . 
  the bbc has a russian broadcast . 
  so does the dw . 
  right and wrong do not matter in history . 
   being unhappy does not mean being right . 
  many slave owners were unhappy after slavery was abolished . 
  and that 's why they waged four years of war against the north . 
  which they lost . 
  had they won , well ... [ this might be how society is now in the south ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewyajii3a4c ) . 
   many racist in the usa were unhappy after civil rights act of 1964 .
