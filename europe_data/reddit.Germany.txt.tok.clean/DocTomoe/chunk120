  as the jugendamt has reasons to believe that the mother is the problem , giving alex the chance to experience male gender behaviors to decide upon the best course of his or her future is the actual sane thing to do . 
   you think that these doctors want to turn boys into girls because they feel that it will forward their cause and show the world that liberalism is the way to go or something ? 
  i do see that in the case discussed , three sets of doctors are mentioned , one who had contact to the kid , and those docs did come to the conclusion that no treatment was necessary . 
  i also do note that i have a regular contact to about 400-600 people , and of those people one ( who is a very good friend ) identifies him/herself as a transsexual . 
  while in here , suddenly , `` transsexual '' people plop out by the dozens once i hint at putting a suicidal kid not on suicide watch but on hormone therapy might be a wrong thing . 
  so , call me paranoid , but yes , i think the rather liberal reddit hive-mind is in this thread , trying to scream me down , and this involves the occassional socketpuppeering . 
   that being said it is irrelevant because we 're not arguing about the safety of the drug , we can find a new drug that will do the same thing , more safely . 
  and until we do that , we risk people 's lives for something not medically necessary ? 
  asked a little more bluntly : would you , should your daughter insist of it at age 11 , pay her a boob job , with all the risks involved ? 
   causes of transsexualism a well-sourced theories page . 
  you might notice just how much larger the `` medical '' part is , and how underdeveloped the psychological theories part is ( it even tells us that ts people dislike psychological theories ) , though i have no doubts about transsexuality being an immensly interesting field of research for anything that starty with psych * . 
  i am not stating the article is biased . 
  i just point out that it likely lacks the depth it could have . 
   10 year old jackie , born a boy , happier as a girl a newspiece , and i must say , a rather disgusting one , because it leads to her being a gimp in a freak show , carefully worded or not . 
  has the following nugget : `` jackie 's sister , sagan , was the first to ask if she really wanted to be a girl . 
  `` yeah , '' she told her sister . '', 
  - which sounds like suggestion to me . 
   gender identity disorder ( link # 1 ) a quick infosheet by a government facility . 
  does n't tell us much new , only adds symptoms not related to the case at hand . 
   gender identity disorder ( link # 2 ) bbc . 
  tells us nothing much new . 
  has the following nugget that has been denied again and again in this thread :  gender identity and sexuality are undoubtedly linked , and so issues about gender identity during childhood and adolescence can be a common experience among gay people growing up . 
  but among that small group who continue to have gender identity disorder into adulthood , the question of their sexual orientation is irrelevant . 
  which means we now have two groups : 1 . 
  true trans kids , who grow up to be transsexuals , the minority 2 . 
  trans kids who actually are gay and switch back to their original , biological gender , the majority the solution , it had been stated , was to wait for a few years , to chemically slow their development down , because they might , you know , actually be trans . 
   gender dysphoria treatment the wikipedia article i have quoted from earlier . 
  has the following , unfortunately unsourced , nugget : `` it should be noted , however , that such blocking of growth hormones may cause significant detrimental musculo-skeletal problems if done for a prolonged period of time ''  if what you say is true and gender identity does n't set in until a later age , why do we see so many 3-4 year olds saying they 're transgender ie `` mommy i 'm a boy '' that has been explained in the bbc link : mostly , they 're actually homosexual . 
   yeah kids get sex ed classes and at 11 you think they 're going to say to themselves `` huh the teacher said that typically testosterone has the effect of giving facial hair to genetic males , i wonder if maybe jimmy is transgender because he does n't have a beard by age 11 '' i have been snarky with that comment because someone wanted to make me believe that somewhere on this planet there are superkids who can wrap their heads around highly-complicated concepts of biochemistry at age 11 . 
  i am sorry if i hit the wrong guy . 
  i can only talk about the sex ed we got at age 11 , and that was mostly `` where do babies come from '' . 
  hormones have been on the schedule years later . 
   but as you can see many psychologists do believe that the evidence points towards gender identity being established early on . 
  psychologists also tried to treat a lot of other stuff which later turned out to be perfectly healthy . 
  they even invented illnesses . 
  i am * not * saying transsexualism does n't exist . 
  what my basic point is is that given a simple risk/reward analysis , the kid in the original article rightfully should be put in psychiatry for having shown suicidal-depressive tendencies and should * not * undergo hormonal delay of puberty , for the simple fact that there is no risk of life involved . 
   can you show me where i 've contradicted myself ? 
  in this post ? 
   transgenderism is n't a `` self-perception thing '' , so i do n't know why you bring that up . 
  there was this nice graphic someone posted around here which had three dimensions of one 's own sexual perception , and as i get scolded again and again to use `` sexuality '' for everything , i made a point in writing all relevant dimensions into my sentence . 
  just another loop to jump through . 
   transgenderism is a `` gender thing '' in the same way that someone born with ambiguous genitals is a `` gender thing '' . 
  and there is no denying that someone with ambiguous genitals can often have a `` medical problem '' . 
  there are very vocal people in this thread downvoting me with their fanboys who in fact state that there is a very definite distinction between gender issues and genitals , and that this line is holy . 
  ha , really ... 
  i seriously have not seen niea 's response . 
  lifeinneon 's is copypasta i 've answered again and again , and who has become abusive , prompting me to stop talking to him . 
  we differ on the categorisation of that boy/girl as trans . 
  i 'm not stating he or she is , i just say that gender identities change rapidly at that age . 
   that 's similar to what was proposed to homosexuals years ago . 
  yes . 
  but in the case of suicidal depression , his or her life is at stake . 
  i am not arguing about gender identity issues when i talk about psychotherapy . 
  you brought up intersex kids . 
  you are muddying the waters , stating my point to make it look like i claimed the exact opposite . 
  is this arguing fairly ? 
  so i linked one page by an independent organisation quoting both sides of the story . 
  let 's see what you have given me . 
  * link 1 : issue-based partisan self-help page with not much credibility and with no scientific sources for that claim . 
  * link 2 : kohlberg , a theoretical psychologist mostly concerned with morality , ** suggests ** . 
  well , that 's a relief , obviously it is now an well-established fact . 
  * link 3 : a college lecture talking about early-childhood development , that kids learn by emulating the world around them , have toy preferences based on those emulations , and then tries to tell us that ** perhaps ** this is a sign of early childhood gender identity . 
  from what i 've seen , unsourced . 
  that 's a rock-solid scientific proof of the thing you want prooved ? 
  * link 4 : yay , healthychildren.org . 
  one-sided display of the issue . 
  paywalled . '', 
  by age four , children 's gender identity is stable , and they know they will always be a boy or a girl . '', 
  contradicts established scientific studies , some of which you yourself quoted . 
  oh ... and unsourced . 
   shall i go on ? 
  if all you can give me is that quality , i spare you your time . 
  that was dreadful . 
   i 'm not arguing if that drug is dangerous or not , its unimportant and its not what we 're arguing about . 
  endangering lives for pulling what seems to be a political agenda more and more the longer you and your friends argue is despicable . 
  btw : you asked for biological negative results , and yes , those are related to the drugs used . 
  surprise surprise . 
  you backpedalling now looks a lot like what you describe as being `` beaten '' . 
   what kind of kid would jump to that conclusion . 
  the same kids getting sex ed classes about hormons at age 11 . 
  please point to the sentence where i expressed transphobia . 
  you claim i 'm not responding as a response to my response ? 
  is this some kind of inception-style stuff ? 
  ok , internet knowledge here ... 1 . 
  the treatment is described as `` controversial '' : http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=90273278 2 . 
  from that same article : `` polly carmichael , a british psychologist who works at the portman clinic in london , which has a unit specifically dedicated to gender identity , ** says the identity of most children this age is in constant flux . 
  ** '' ( which is exactly what i 've argued the whole time ) 2 . 
  from the same article : `` taking testosterone or estrogen immediately after blocking puberty will make a teenage patient sterile . '', 
  ( yes , i know , that 's for stage two ) 3 . 
  one of the drugs used to delay puberty is [ goserelin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goserelin ) - there might be others , but let 's focus on this one , as i am not a pharmacist . 
  but i 'm sure i will find similar stuff for any drug you 're giving me . 
  let 's see what wikipedia tells us about the side effects ...  `` memory loss may be severe and may not return to normal levels . '', 
   why do his/her peers know that they are on hormone blockers ? 
  as if kids would n't realize * somebody * is the last one to develop a beard/breasts . 
  you are wrongfully assuring that hormone and thus puberty-blocking is free of negative permanent biological and societal results leading to unhappiness . 
  as in problems with the muscoskeletal system , or depression created by mobbing from his or her peers ( or being known as * that * person ) . 
   back when i was suffering in my own way [ . . ] , i did n't seek meaning . 
  i sought an end to the suffering . 
  which is fine .
