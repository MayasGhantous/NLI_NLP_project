  but sometimes one thing is the other . 
   we can help her to not suffer . 
  why would you refuse her this basic human right ? 
  we can help him or her not to suffer later in life . 
  or we can , with the same action , * cause * suffering later in life , should alex decide to be male later in his non-puberty . 
  i wrote about that somewhere else here ... 
  as you now state clearly that you intend to insult me for no good reason ( but your own twisted way of morality where allowing a healthy kid to grow up is equal to setting it on fire ) , i will cease communicating with you and have reported the last post to moderators . 
  it 's a fun thing i have n't willfully insulted you one time in this thread , while you do so in every single post . 
  i guess it 's just something you ca n't accept : that there are people who think that what is not broken does not have to be fixed . 
   at the moment it is both though , except that there is no psychiatric remedy for the situation . 
  none . 
  you are of course an expert for the psychiatric remedy of suicide prevention . 
  which often enough is getting strapped down and drowsed , but usually involves antidepressive therapy . 
   the most reasonable course of action is to give the kid time to decide for themselves without making permanent changes of any kind . 
  as you are making permanent changed in any course of action , do the one that would naturally occur . 
   i 'm sorry your parents did n't tell you the truth . 
  what does that have to do with this ? 
  medical remedies are something usually not discussed to kids , there is little doctor -  kid communication . 
  it is something that was like that back then , and it is something that i see every other day today . 
   by age 17 , most girls are already doing that whole menstrual cycle thing . 
  it would be silly to do it at 17 . 
  extremely silly . 
  i am a male , but i doubt the average 17-year old female intuitively learns about which hormone is created where when and what effect it has . 
  it 's like looking at a venus transit and understanding the physics involved . 
   psychotherapy has never worked . 
  sure . 
   you want to use psychotherapy to treat a medical condition , gid is a medical condition when it 's convinient for it to be one , and a psychological one when it is convinient for the reddit hivemind . 
  in another subthread , another proponent argues exactly in the different way . 
   kids with medical conditions learn about their treatments . 
  this is normal . 
  `` mommy , i think i 'd rather have an unicorn bed ... '' - `` ok . we 'll pump you full of growth-inhibiting hormones , throw you back six years behind the social development of your peers and when your father has no more say about it , we start snipping away your genitals '' . 
  when i was 10 , i had that rather unusual , 6 * 1.5 cm long melanocytic nevus cut out , because they feared it might be a melanoma . 
  technically , i had a medical problem . 
  guess what : the doc did n't start to explain me what exactly the problem was , i had no idea about things like skin cancer , surgery or anesthetics . 
  i got sent into there , got cut and stitched up , and then i went home . 
  i learned years later what that was about . 
  maybe i was just half a year too young , or this was not related to my gender/sexuality/genital complex ? 
   lots of things cause suicidal depression in otherwise perfectly healthy people . 
  depression itself is the illness to be treated . 
   the correct response is n't to try not to feel the emotion but to try to get into a better circumstance that does n't depress you . 
  some things can not be had . 
  i recommend viktor frankl 's `` trotzdem ja zum leben sagen '' , in which he argues that anything can be coped with by ignoring bad emotions and concentrating on the good things in life . 
  he survived auschwitz with that , so i think he has some street cred . 
   you 're denying this girl that right . 
  i deny that 11 is an appropriate age to let a kid decide that medical doctors play chemical cocktail funtime with its body . 
   if you 're a girl , and you start growing body hair and your voice deepens to masculine levels , that 's going to depress you . 
  actually , what would depress me is an environment that does make fun of me in that situation . 
   the answer is n't to take medication to counteract the depression . 
  it 's to take medicine to counteract what 's giving you body hair and deepening your voice . 
  i do think we disagree on this one . 
  btw : deep voice and body hair are something pretty natural for xx-chromosomial hetero - / homo - / pansexual female-gender girl-phenotypes ( i hope i touched all the relevant bases now ), 
   you 're conflating the terms medical condition with psychological disorder . 
  in the end , there is no difference . 
  both are deviations of the percieved norm that cause suffering and/or social stigma and that can be treated using the appropriate therapy . 
   but transgender people do have a problem that often needs medical treatment , and that is not a problem that can be treated through mood stabilizers , cognitive behavioral therapy , or any other form of psychological treatment . 
  if there are two ways to solve a problem , use the one less likely to cause medical harm . 
  which , indeed , are psychopharmaka and psychiatric therapies in this case . 
   and being depressed is a healthy response to that . 
  there is * nothing * healthy about anything that involves suicidal depression . 
  if we ca n't even agree on that one , i fail to see how we are going to carry on with the discussion . 
   it 's a discrepancy between your gender identity and physical sex . 
  it has nothing to do with who you 're attracted to or what turns you on . 
  yay semantics . 
  i fall over this trap again and again because we simply do n't distinguish in our language outside of very academic circles . 
  you are right , of course , and i did mean that half-sentence in the way you just described . 
  having gender issues is not the reason alex is getting ferried to the local psychiatric clinic , having hinted at suicide is . 
   that 's what you 're arguing . 
  actually , i 'm not . 
  i 'm arguing that no intervention is necessary nor advisable until the kid is in an age able and legally allowed to decide what happens to him or her . 
  but if you think this is a medical problem , then change the one thing with less medical risk involved , and the one less invasive . 
  which happens to be the brain . 
  slippery slope * can * be a logical fallacy , when you talk about a =  b =  c =  d , but that 's not my argument at all . 
  i used it as a warning . 
  not wanting to put a kid into the hands of doctors to satisfy one side of what seems to be a parental dispute now makes you `` transphobia scum '' ... nice . 
   we 're talking about letting people have medical intervention for an 11-year old kids ? 
  it might feel wrong , but guess what : we all had changed to our bodies in our puberty we were n't exactly happy about . 
  that 's normal * and * expected . 
  it might just hit him or her a little harder . 
  slippery slope . 
  you could argue that if there is a problem between body and brain , why not change the brain ? 
  do we really want to have that kind of medicine back ? 
  hm , just read the icd-iv description of gid :  f64 .2 gender identity disorder of childhood : a disorder , usually first manifest during early childhood ( and always well before puberty ) , characterized by a ** persistent ** and ** intense distress ** about assigned sex , together with a desire to be ( or insistence that one is ) of the other sex . 
  there is a ** persistent preoccupation with the dress and activities of the opposite sex ** and ** repudiation of the individual 's own sex ** . 
  the diagnosis requires a profound disturbance of the normal gender identity ; ** mere tomboyishness in girls or girlish behavior in boys is not sufficient ** . 
  gender identity disorders in individuals who have reached or are entering puberty should not be classified here but in f66 . - . 
  emphasis by me . 
  guess what : when the taz article describes how he or she was put in front of a cupboard , dolls left , play cars right , that was exactly what the doctors were testing : persistent preoccupation and repudiation . 
  when he or she chose a puzzle ( and thus gender-neutral ) , she or he prooved that this criterium does n't apply . 
  i do n't see how the rightness of a biologically natural puberty has anything to do with my perception of transsexuality . 
  but yes , it does exist , and yes , he or she might have it , with emphasis on `` might '' . 
   you appear to be confusing puberty delaying androgen blockers with cryogenic suspension . 
  so , let 's say he or she stays in a child-like limbo until at age 18 , the doctors decide it 's time to stop possibly dangerous medicamentation , he or she is old enough to choose . 
  for reasons unknown , he or she decides either way . 
  the appropriate steps are done . 
  either way , she or he will have lost years in her mental and sexual development , lost opportunities to learn how to hook up with potential partners , how to act in an adult society . 
  hormones change behavior , as every parent of a teenage kid will tell you , and she or he will experience this at age 18 or 19 , when he or she is supposed to be at university or working ( which will probably lead to problems in either field ) . 
  he or she will always , for the rest of her or his life , lag behind his or her peers . 
  sure , that 's not cyrogenic . 
  but it still is a problem . 
   which is exactly what having any puberty you 're not sure you want would do .
