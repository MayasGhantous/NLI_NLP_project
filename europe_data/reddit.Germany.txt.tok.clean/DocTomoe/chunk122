  hence delaying it until she 's older and can make a more informed decision . 
  and once again we are mistaking `` growing legs '' with `` amputating legs '' . 
  the first fixed rail is a naturally-occuring and biologically-speaking healthy phenomeon . 
  the second one is not . 
   if you 're insinuating that going through the wrong puberty has no negative consequences , i know a fair few transsexuals ( and know of one cissexual ) who would disagree with you . 
  we 've all , regardless of our gender perception , had our bad teenage years . 
  it is pretty natural . 
  you slap the face of every * real * disfigured person on this planet . 
  i think i 'm done discussing this with you . 
   gender identity disorder hm , there is . 
  so let 's look what the easily-accessible sources ( in this case : wikipedia ) say , huh ? 
   some clinicians report a significant proportion of young children with gender identity disorder no longer have such symptoms later in life . 
  or ... `` it just may be a phase '' . 
   it should be noted , however , that such blocking of growth hormones may cause significant detrimental musculo-skeletal problems if done for a prolonged period of time . 
  or ... `` irrevocable medical issues in preventing puberty '' . 
   yet , because transexuality disturbs you personally and because one of the accepted treatments for gender dysphoria is sex reassignment , you will ignore the criteria and the diagnosis that best fits the situation and insist on a less accurate one instead i am ** not ** disturbed by transsexuality . 
  what ** does ** disturb me is seeing a healthy kid getting thrown into a legal mess because his/her parents fight , and now is supposed to do an unnecessary medical treatment to proove a point and to make her/him stand on a pedestal of self-proclaimed gender equality crusaders , stealing from him/her the opportunity to make an informed , adult decision later in life only * after * her/his body has been irrevocably altered ( and yes , delaying puberty * will * alter her/his body and mental development . ), 
   spiffy , i think you 've indicated your level of credibility in this discussion very well . 
  somewhat more educated about things of psychical nature than you are ? 
  yes . 
  i do n't know where you live , but at age 11 , in 5 ^ th class , we did receive sex ed . 
  it just did n't exactly include biochemistry . 
  that came at age 17 , 11 ^ th class , with the female menstrual cycle . 
  please tell me the country where 11-year-olds are taught that they can be any gender they prefer if the nice doctor gives them a syringe of inhibiting their natural development and transform their body into * appearing * to be what it is not . 
   they want and deserve relief then . 
  as a non-medical son of a family of psychiatrists , all the symptoms that have described in this thread sound a lot like it could be solved by a diagnosis of adjustment disorder ( icd-10 f43 .2 ) and the subsequent psychotherapy , which , guess what , sounds exactly what the jugendamt seems to advocate . 
   umm , yes , most transgender people require the medical treatment of hormone replacement therapy , and most require significant surgical interventions . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; we 've had people decide some gender/sex/self-perception things were a medical problem , and that led the affected people to death camps . 
  we have now agreed , and it took us a long time to do so , that neither is a medical condition . 
  depression from failure to adapt can be . 
   how does manipulating sex organs change who you want to have sex with ? 
  you are contradicting yourself right now . 
  gender-identity ! = sexual orientation . 
  and biological sex is neither . 
  the moment doctors start manipulating sex organs , and they will do so when they start screwing around with his/her puberty , it is a matter of sexuality . 
  your chart is nice , but it describes a very specific way to use language that is not based on biology . 
  i 'm sorry , but i * refuse * to accept healthy sexual deviancies from the percieved norm to be classified as illnesses that have to be treated . 
  we 've done this until the 1970s , and one of the main good things we 've done was accepting people as they are . 
  i do believe the jugendamt will do the steps appropriate to the situation , and that very well could be genderneutral psychological treatment from all i read - or what polemically has been described as `` giving her/him the opportunity to develop another gender image '' . 
  at least the jugendamt does not pull her into the spotlight of a rather shady newspaper . 
  does she/he die within a short timespan because of natural causes if he/she does n't get that treatment ? 
  suicide is not a natural cause . 
  if not , then it is not a necessary medical procedure . 
  and again : medical guardianship has been transferred to the jugendamt by her mother , who now can not decide on that anymore , and his/her father wo n't decide so , either . 
  it might not solve his/her problem , but it would solve mine , 
  as her parents have given the medical guardianship to the jugendamt , the matter is out of their hands . 
  in the end it will probably result in psychoanalytic therapy , likely what the official wants , if not all that extreme . 
  i wonder where alex got the idea that she absolutely has to get any hormone treatment at all ... when i was 11 , i had no idea about anything like that . 
  is there some kind of kid 's self-help book like `` my first sexualtherapeutic doctor 's visit ? '', 
  german law is not created by the `` world professional association for transgender health '' . 
  you have to be an adult to decide about unnecessary ( = non-emergency ) medical procedures being done upon you without your guardian 's permit . 
  are you implying that transsexuality ( and by proxy : homosexuality ) are medical conditions to be treated ? 
  i had hoped we 've come over that idea . 
  ah , come on . 
  intersex very obviously is a medical condition , comparable to other deformities . 
  in the case of `` trans children '' we are talking about a healthy male or female body with the brain being hard-wired to be the other gender . 
  genetics 101 do disagree . 
   the use of puberty delaying drugs that buy time , followed by hormone therapy for those who need it , has overwhelmingly better results than any other treatment . 
  treatment would imply there is some kind of medical problem , which is not . 
  alex is a healthy 11-year-old . 
   a trans girl is a girl . 
  a carrier of the y chromosome is male . 
  that 's pretty much basic biology . 
   you are making claims condemned by all major world medical authorities . 
  a `` major world medical authority '' of course per definition is what agrees with your views on the matter . 
  not necessarily insufficient . 
  it is a naturally occuring phenomeon . 
  i deny that the puberty that has been programmed into him/her is inappropriate or wrong . 
  nobody asked me if i was * happy * with growing two legs , why had i not been asked if i might want one sawed off when i was 11 ? 
  after all , my personality could have been extremely damaged by growing up like my genetic predisposition dictated . 
  it seems we have a different definition of `` damage '' . 
  and the appeal will fail as well . 
  lets hope the provisional measure that will come sooner will not cripple the situation even more . 
   there 's talk about brainwashing her into being a boy . 
  there 's a wishlist of what her/his public worker wants therapy to be . 
  which has nothing to do with what a psychiatry would do . 
   the average patient is depressive , not transsexual . 
  from a medical view , a suicidal patient is by definition either depressive , suffers from a bipolar disorder or is schizophrenic . 
  there is ( no longer ) a diagnosis called `` transsexuality '' . 
  if alex has been identified as a suicidal person , this has nothing to do with her/his percieved sexuality . 
   btw : the most likely outcome of trying is suicide . 
  of course it is . 
  / s  well , imagine people in white coats talking you into feeling , being , and identifying with another sex than you actually have . 
  no self-respecting ethical framework allows such things . 
  so anything that might force you into doing things you would n't normally do tortures you ? 
  it might come to a surprise to you , but even delaying puberty is a medical procedure , and kids under 18 can not agree on such procedures . 
  right . 
  so where is there a rights infrigement when a thus legitimized official decides someone is suicidal and puts that person into psychiatry ? 
  genderchanging surgery exists and is relatively often done . 
  it 's not life-long . 
   it 's not lost years , it 's years in which she is n't forced to go into directions she does n't want to go into . 
  naturally occuring , healthy bodily changes are hardly force . 
   read the article , that dutch study , which says that trans kids claim to be girls , homosexuals merely want to be girls . 
  a single dutch study . 
  would you risk your kid 's life and the chance of future happiness on it ? 
   what 's currently at stake is getting her brainwashed into not being trans . 
  if he/she really is trans , no amount of brainwashing will change that . 
  he/she might learn to live more to the ideas society has about him/her , but in the end his/her sexual identity will not change . 
  if it 's just an episode , there have n't been any negative ideas , either . 
   `` alex has never been assessed independently '' .
