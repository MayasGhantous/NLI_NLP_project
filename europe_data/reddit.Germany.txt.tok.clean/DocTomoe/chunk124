  the way dkms operates is standard operating procedure on the international level . 
  if ont takes the sample , the associated dataset is marked as `` belonging '' to ont . 
  only , they did n't . 
   i think this is the what ont is unhappy about , i.e. 
  the people did n't give dkms permission to store the samples in a database for other , future , cases . 
  i know the form ... they can choose to do or do n't , but it is highly encouraged to do because of humanitarian reasons . 
  the article does not mention ont being unhappy about the privacy situation . 
  here is what dkms does : 1 . 
  they get a patient that has no viable match in their database . 
  now they go there with a team of paramedics , and collect samples from volunteers . 
  this usually happens on a saturday in a large auditorium , and is heavily advertised both by the patients family as well as by dkms itself . 
  these samples get tested . 
  statistically , there is a higher chance of viable donors in your town , especially if your family has lived there for a longer time . 
  if a match of the individual donor for the original patient was done , great , let 's start the transplantation process . 
  if no match of the invidual donor was made , dkms puts the info into it 's database , to make it possible to match the donor with a future or present patient . 
  this info has a half-life , because , well , donors do n't live forever . 
  matching the nonviable donors to completely foreign patients minimizes costs and maximizes survival in leukaemia patients . 
  the 14500 bucks/transplantation donor are for financing this process . 
  the article , and the ont press release , are highly biased , imho . 
  the spanish system might work to ~ ~ extract ~ ~ get donated viable organs from just-deceased persons , but bone marrow transplants need active intervention by willing donors , while they are alive and healthy . 
  it seems to me their ont system fails in such cases . 
  * edit * changed last paragraph to make it sound less evil - it was not intended to sound like that . 
   the bone marrow surely belongs to the person whose bones it is . 
  and you read otherwise where ? 
  the system does not claim rights on bone marrow , but on the dataset based on it . 
  the organisation who took and analyzed the sample has put money in this process , and gets compensated . 
  the mere fact that not every sample collected ( the fewest do ) leads to a transplantation does mean that the `` positive match '' has to pay for all the `` negative tests '' . 
  to maximize the intake of samples and to prevent double testings , an international database exists , which dkms has put it 's datasets in , with the agreement that whoever gets this donor has to pay the analysis and administrative fees . 
   with the donors permission ? 
  does n't the company need permission to store samples for any length of time ? 
  seems like a privacy issue it seems you are not a registered donor ( i happen to be ) . 
  you undersign that they are allowed to do exactly this . 
  which makes sense ( your marrow might be incompatible with the case at hand , but a perfect match for someone else fourty kilometers away . ), 
   not using the database that dkms has set up seems like the thing to do . 
  sure , let your patients die while they wait for another donor from another , smaller database . 
  i guess they would love that idea . 
   is doctomoe on dkms payroll ? 
  is stating facts and arguing consistently now a case of looking like a sockpuppet ? 
  i work as a database guy in a retailer , 
   they have absolutely no vested interest . 
  there is no such thing as altruism . 
  maybe their interest might not be done in terms of money , but aspects such as prestige or rising in the ranks do exist . 
   dkms ( in business to make money ) . 
  the dkms is a gemeinn\u00fctzige gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter haftung ( ggmbh , roughly translated to `` non-profit with limited liability '' ) . 
  this is one form of non-profits in germany . 
  by law , they can not use any money they make outside of their field of operations , especially they can not get money out to their shareholders . 
  hm , we are talking about this very specific thing : bone marrow transplants . 
  it might be a nice thing to have a few million non-opposing kidney donors ( in case of neurological death ) running around , but bone marrow is different . 
  * firstly , it ( usually ? ), 
  is to be donated by living people , and i just ca n't see the police rounding up random passer-bys to check if someone is compatible with a leukaemia patient . 
  * secondly : you need a database to check for compatible cases , as compatible donors are hard to come by . 
  this is what dkms does : it does testings on possible donors , categorizes it , and makes the database and/or matchings available for hospitals . 
  the associated fees are for maintaining the infrastructure and doing the initial testings ( note : several hundred people will have to sign up for that testing before one donor in a case is found . 
  each of these testings costs ~ 60 $ according to the last figures i 've found . ), 
  arguably i am not a specialist in the legal process of organ donation , especially not over different legislative systems . 
  i do remember , however , that a few years ago we had statistics of donations per hospital , and i can very likely imagine that it reflects badly on a hospital if it has a substandard relation between donations and dead patients , which might result in scrutiny of the bmg and/or repressions in funding . 
  of course i can not prove any of this , but i like to be a little paranoid when it comes to areas that might affect survival . 
  i do not believe the well-being of many do trump the well-being of the individual . 
  we all have our codes and legislations and best practices , but can you claim with a clear conscience that you always followed every rule , even in cases where noone could reasonably question your judgement ? 
  you think medical doctors are the one , only profession in this world who do not cut corners now and then ? 
   the donors proportion is 34,2 per million inhabitants . 
  the article is about bone marrow transplants . 
  for a leukemia patient it 's only little comfort to know that if he had a problem with his or her kidneys , he 'd be privileged . 
  let 's not muddy the water . 
  from the article : * spain : 90000 donors . 
  [ 90000 / population of spain ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%289*10000%29%2fpopulation+of+spain ) = 1990 donors per million * germany : 2500000 donors . 
  [ 2500000 / population of germany ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2500000%2fpopulation+of+germany ) = 30500 donors per million . 
   even if you are n't a registered donor , you ( or your family ) can decide to done your organs ** at any given time ** . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; i hope this is meant to mean something different than how i read it . 
  i 'd like doctors to put every effort into getting me back to a stable life instead of running to my family , which whom i might not be on best terms , and ask them if they can harvest my organs . 
   this company is attacking the very thing that works marvellously in spain , the organ donor system . 
  from the statement in that very article :  the fact is , there are only 90,000 registered donors in spain , versus 2.5 million in germany . 
  excuse me if i 'm wrong , but that does n't sound like a marvellously working system . 
  editorializing , are we ? 
   * the fact that the ont does * believe * dkms 's actions to be illegal does not make them illegal . 
  there are a lot of conjunctives in that paragraph . 
  questions of legality should be solved in a court of law . 
  * is n't there some kind of eu legislation about tissue traffic ? 
  ( i only found [ this ] ( http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/docs/news/organtrafficking_study.pdf ) , but it does n't define tissue . 
  is a salvia sample , and thus parts of the oral mucosa , which should be unfit to transplant , `` tissue '' in the sense of the * 2002 additional protocol to the convention on human rights and biomedicine concerning transplantation of organs and tissues of human origin * ? 
  was money involved in the transfer of the salvia samples , e.g. 
  did the donors get paid for their samples ? 
  ( else it would n't be `` trafficking '' ) * the dkms is a non-profit , a so-called `` gemeinn\u00fctzige gmbh '' . 
  they can not , by law , turn up profits to be distributed to shareholders . 
  * what are the `` usual '' fees ? 
  usual in which context ? 
  usual in spain ? 
  in the iberian peninsula ? 
  in europe ? 
  everything is a little more expensive over here : cars , taxes , why not bone marrow matching services ? 
  * as far as i understand it , dkms does not invoice recipients , but their insurances . 
  * dkms is funded by the krebshilfe and by donations . 
  coty is one of those donors , but by far not the the largest one . 
  is this getting back at us because of the cucumbers ? 
  you mistake pride with paranoia and a sense of impending doom , 
  china is no threat . 
  they are masterful copiers , but there is no innovation . 
  the idea is to out-innovate them . 
  in the 1950s , we mostly traded with south america , africa and the middle east . 
  this might have it 's reason to the fact our direct neighbours did n't exactly like talking to us for obvious reasons .
