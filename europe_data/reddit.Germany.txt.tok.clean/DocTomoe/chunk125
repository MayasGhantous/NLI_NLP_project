  still , our economy grew massively . 
  in the 1990s and 2000s , we mostly traded with the eu , and not only did we pay massively to an international body that treated us as a moneysack , our economy also was close to collapse , several times . 
  i know , post hoc ergo propter hoc , but i am convinced there 's a pattern . 
  i am aware that with a little luck and good salespeople , we could quickly reroute our wares to other , less looting customers . 
  in the end : higher bank fees for the small customers . 
  nobody expects the banks to pay it out of * their * pockets . 
  you are aware that frankfurt is a rather important financial market , and that it 's only a matter of time the deutsche b\u00f6rse buys the london stock exchange , much like we bought the nyse ? 
  just for the sake of the argument : what makes you believe there is not a very obvious link between economic and structural growth ? 
  i am comparing a time when we rebuilt the better part of the country from post-war status to somewhat halfway presentable to a time when we rebuilt the east from something resembling hardly a second-world country to something somewhat presentable . 
  given , the task in '48 might have been easier , but in the end , it 's not that different . 
  and the advantages are getting ripped off by both tax offices ,

   so you can base your opinions on where am i from ? 
  actually , i enjoy learning other languages . 
  i said we become increasingly willing to let the eu crash . 
  there 's a difference . 
   that 's even more terrible . 
  why ? 
  do you think a system that has outlived it 's purpose has to be kept intact no matter the cost ? 
   you think wwi would have gone global if you germans has just had the sense to march up to the belgian frontier and look across and look at each other and say , yes . 
  it only would have ended much worse for germany , with a stronger western front that would have quickly extended into baden and rhineland areas . 
  have a look at the pact systems 1914 , and tell me again there was no reason for a global war if it had n't been for the rather unimportant belgium . 
   everyone does n't have to die for this . 
  everyone would have died for something else . 
  war was already set in motion , it only was a question about how it would proceed . 
   the belgians did n't invade germany . 
  they were happy to get the spoils afterwards , though . 
    nazi club  wut it 's a common strategy when it comes to arguing with germans : just show them just how racist they are supposed to be ( invoking images of slave-labour and racial slurs ) , and thus send them on a guilt-trip back to ' 41 . 
  we call this the `` nazikeule '' or `` nazi club '' . 
  spanish ? 
   neither enlighten me . 
   yes , but you 've said that you want to quit eu no . 
  i said we become increasingly willing to let the eu crash . 
  there 's a difference . 
   but the germans invade the belgians twice in 25 years and start 2 world wars ** one ** world war . 
  the second one . 
  ww1 was austria 's doing . 
  thanks for proving my point : everyone invades their neighbors . 
  thanks for the insight in british history ( not exactly my strong point ) . 
  and for those videos , 
  spanish ? 
   it 's not because you are solidary international politics never are about solidarity . 
  it 's always hard cash . 
   you can compare the situation with the immigrants from southern europe i wonder what you would have written if you had n't had that nazi club laying around ... 
  well , ask the scots about that , or the welsh . 
  or the irish , for that matter . 
  other than that , it 's hard invading neighbours when you 're an island . 
   well invading people is n't exactly being neighbourly is it ? 
  when i look at my history book , well , actually , that 's exactly what neighbours do with a certain frequency , regardless of the flag they rally under . 
  i do not say it 's a nice thing to do . 
   baden-w\u00fcrtemberg why yes , i am . 
  i also lived in bavaria for the better part of my studies . 
   as you can see , most of your exports are within the eu . 
  if the eu '' burns '' like you say , you will not be able to export for free . 
  that is an assumption which imho is wrong on several levels . 
  you think we could not quickly reshuffle our exports back to the international stage . 
  believe it or not , but german machinery is well-liked everywhere . 
  you think either of the european countries can afford putting high import tariffs on our goods . 
  guess what : that would ruin them even quicker . 
  eu or not , we still are the economic powerhouse of the continent , and we are well able to wage economic war against something the size of france . 
   the only l\u00e4nder that sustain germany . 
  actually , hessen is pretty well-off , too . 
  i agree that we should probably kick the fnl out and gift them to poland or something . 
  too much trouble . 
   the russians did n't declare war on germany . 
  it was mutual , and the russians had started planning for this in mid-july . 
   as for that luxembourg thing , that is even more horrible . 
  i am not aware of us acting exactly savage with either the belgians or the luxembourgish . 
   but you germans invaded poor old little belgium , which really was a bully thing to do , how much smaller than you is belgium ? , before russia invaded you . 
  we also invaded luxembourg , which is smaller still . 
  russia declared war on august 1 ^ st , 1914 . 
  we invaded belgium on august 4 ^ th , 1914 . 
   that 's a horrible way to carry on and it changed a row into a war . 
  it was the only way to ensure having a mere chance to break out of the entente . 
  destroy french resistance early . 
  total destruction was pretty much gone in the 60s . 
   if you had n't declared war on them , the russians might have put their preparations aside . 
  yeah , sure . 
  russia * wanted * that war , as did france . 
  the whole treaty system between france , russia and england ( look it up : entente ) was designed for this kind of war to break out . 
   and anyway , you germans shot up about 170,000 russian in a week in late august 1914 at tannenbaum . 
  war is hell . 
   it 's not fair to blame the german invasion of bruges on the russians . 
  i never did that . 
  russia prepared war against germany , thus prompting germany to declare what was already done de-facto . 
  the first acts of war were done by russia when they marched into eastern prussia . 
  bruges ... was an act of self-defense as well as a violation of international law ( which , as we all know , does not exist in the absence of a leviathan ) . 
  it was clear we would not survive a two-fronts war . 
  give me * any * data , and i spin it in a way to support my point of view . 
  it 's journalism 101 . 
  die welt is a highly partisan newspaper close to the cdu . 
  she is not a reliable source . 
  the federal budget , however ... 
   you declared war on russia , then france , then you invaded belgium . 
  based on this logic , russia and france started it . 
  they could just have ignored the austrian declaration of war . 
  that being said : ww1 broke out . 
  ww2 was unleashed . 
  the question is not how often you fall , it is how often you stand up . 
  that being said , you draw a very ... one-sided picture of germany 's economic role in the early 20 ^ th century , conviniently letting out reparations of ww1 which were ** designed ** to crush us .
