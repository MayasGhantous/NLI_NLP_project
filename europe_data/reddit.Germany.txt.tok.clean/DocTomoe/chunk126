  the economic crisis and in the last aspect ww2 was created in versailles . 
  you have proovable sources for this , right ? 
  i fail to find a `` massive income from the eu '' line in our federal budget . 
   and if it ever happens and germany survives good luck in competing against the 408kg gorillas from other continents in the globalized economy . 
  we did it before , we will do so again . 
  can italy ? 
  can france ? 
  the rest , we will see . 
   without the eu germany would have not being able to grow as much as it it ( especially recently ) since the german `` boom '' depends on exports . 
  if there was no euro and no eu german exports would have been far less . 
  funny how we grew a lot more when we traded with international , non-eu countries , and when there was no euro , in the 1950s and '60s i know , i do n't speak for the majority in this subreddit , but the majority of the german population is just about to want to see the eu burn . 
  we have the funny idea that the eu might have benefitted the economy , but not our population , now the population is asked to pay for countries who acted irresponsibly . 
  that some of those irresponsible countries now have the chutzpah to act against us , the ones trying to rescue this sinking ship , will only be seen as arrogance , and will turn the public opinion even more against the eu . 
  we gulped down the greeks who had the audacity to ask for a referendum when we basically gifted them money with very few strings attached , strings that would have benefitted their situation in the medium and long term . 
  we also mostly ignored them trying to guilt-trip us into the nazi corner . 
  france and italy are well-adviced not to assume we 'd be as forgiving again . 
  public support is quickly crumbling , and we have elections comming up in ' 13 . 
  if the situation deteroriates again , i can see leading parties becoming eurosceptic . 
  let them come . 
  and when we 've crushed them , i hope they have the dignity not asking us for handouts again . 
  i think we 're done talking here . 
  let 's hope we do n't have too many of your kind in positions of political power . 
   i always was for giving bavaria the right of secession . 
  me too . 
  i happen to not be bavarian . 
  but i like their way of life . 
   yes , german wages were almost stagnant . 
  desaster !, 
  they were stagnant while inflation was prevalent , thus resulting in real wage decrease . 
  i personally know people who pray the winter is n't coming because they would n't be able to affort heating ( and those are what you would describe as `` middle class '' ) . 
  compare that to countries where wages rised faster than inflation . 
  the absolute amount of money is irrelevant . 
  what matters is the relative loss of standards of living . 
   which was in your opinion the first country to break the maastricht criteria and set an example ? 
  i give you a guess , it was none of those you listed . 
  you are wrong , i listed it . 
  it was us . 
  guess what , when we did , we did n't bring down the whole eurozone with us . 
  shall we have a look at the respective countries ' debt-to-economy relations ? 
   no , i believe rescuing the union is necessary to save our economy . 
  we disagree on this one . 
  i think there is a point in time when an arm has to be amputated before it kills the whole body . 
  i 'd rather have three to five years stagnation while we get our exporta back to the international market than continue playing with fire in the gunpowder house , and risk our good credit standing . 
   our poverty is nothing compared to the poverty that still exists in those countries whose standard of living improved `` dramatically '' . 
  so ... to allow them to get dramatically better , we now should be the nice guys and give up what we worked hard for ? 
   they just came out of the collapse of the soviet union . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  check real wage development of the last twenty years in spain , portugal , greece , italy and ireland compared to germany . 
  neither of these countries were vasals of the ussr . 
  those happen to be the countries who spent like there is no tomorrow , and now come to get bailed out . 
   i do n't have a credit card . 
  what are you implying ? 
  i am implying that it might be a bad idea to give your credit score into the hands of people who have proven again and again that they are unable to handle money in a sane manner , exactly what will happen once we are to pay for eurobonds . 
  right . 
  we have this faction of pro-europe folks who do believe rescuing the union is worth destroying our economy , and by proxy those of other european nations . 
  fact is , the german economy will suffer greatly , resulting in even more povertisation than what we endured the last twenty years ( a time when other eu standards of living rised dramatically ) , while we will give nations who have proven they ca n't handle money direct access to our credit rating . 
  would you give a 16-year old your black amex card ? 
  we can only hope they will stay firm on this one . 
  right . 
  you wrote that , too . 
  and quickly hinted that the bverfg judges might ignore the gg for the greater good . 
  i doubt that would match the usual , rather conservative way of them to interpret the constitution . 
   germany could give itself a new constitution you think abolishing the gg to allow eurobonds would be a suitable reaction ? 
  neither . 
  currency fluctuations of this level happen all the time . 
  when the euro started out in ' 02 , it immediately went down in value against the dollar , then , for a few years , the dollar was worthless against the euro . 
  it happens , and it will happen again . 
  yeah . 
  when we dumped hugo boss , everything went downhill ... 
  i blame our sense of fashion . 
  this sounds a lot like the premise of hellsing , but i 'd love to see your idea on the silver screen ... 
  i 'd pay good money for a ticket . 
  hm , the argument gets thrown around every time we do some big sports fest . 
  the 1972 olympics were meant to be the `` gay ( in the sense of happy ) games '' to make the world see we 're nice guys now , the 1974 worldcup had similar slogans . 
  i think it 's mostly a marketing slogan for us to gulp down the massive costs . 
  the fun fact is that the more the war is mentioned , the more we belittle the one doing it . 
  the uk seems like the old grumpy grandpa who still has not gotten over it . 
  too bad the rest of the world has moved on . 
  have a sympathy upvote for making me laugh . 
  i fail to see nationalist bitterness in my post . 
  the uk is doomed if they continue on their course , and they shy away from the life-buoy we have been offering them for decades now . 
  your * strukturwandel * you 've had in the 1970s and 1980s would have been a lot easier if you had been better integrated . 
  now , you are overly dependant on your financial sector - a system that has crashed slightly in ' 08 , and which will crash catastrophically within the next decade . 
  this time it 's for real - let us save you , or vanish . 
  in my reality , the uk becomes more irrelevant by each day - they know it , they know their american friends will not help them uphold their status , and joining the eu for real goes over their head for historical reasons . 
  they are in fear , anxietous to be controlled in part my paris ( you fought countless wars against the french ) , in part by berlin ( oh , the krauts , the krauts ) , in part by athens and rome and lisbon . 
  and they hate it . 
  so they become delusional naysayers , trying to prove their own worth by diminishing the standing of uk 's neighbours . 
  history will tell which of our realities was closer to the truth . 
  you said it yourself in the title : '' ** british politicians ** and central bankers to call for a downgrade for france '' . 
  such a downgrade , whom would it help , * cui bono * ? 
  right , eurosceptic british politicians . 
  there is a conflict in interest , and this makes me think this is likely a political plot instead of a fair approximation of statistical values . 
  fiscal manipulation to strengthen domnestic political goals . 
  the bbc had it right years ago . 
  from `` yes , minister '' ( episode * a conflict of interest * ) :  ** hacker ** : do n't tell me about the press . 
  i know exactly who reads the papers : the daily mirror is read by people who think they run the country ; the guardian is read by people who think they ought to run the country ; the times is read by people who actually do run the country ; the daily mail is read by the wives of the people who run the country ; the financial times is read by people who own the country ; the morning star is read by people who think the country ought to be run by another country ; and the daily telegraph is read by people who think it is . 
   ** sir humphrey ** : prime minister , what about the people who read the sun ? 
   ** bernard ** : sun readers do n't care who runs the country , as long as she 's got big tits . 
  we got it , you do n't like the french .
