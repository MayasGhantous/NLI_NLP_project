  either they have citizenship and a right to stay , or they do n't , in which case make them leave . 
   if we agree that radical islamist teaching of children is not something we protect under freedom of speech , and here we already got problems . 
  how radical is `` radical '' ? 
  what might appear radical to you might be perfectly sane to me ( for instance , you might think sacrificing small animals is unacceptable , or having to propelytze every saturday ) . 
  is there a real difference between radical islam and radical christianity ? 
  as we can not find a common denominator about what constitutes `` radicalism '' , the only things we can do to be fair is forbid everything , or allow everything . 
  also , i consider it wrong to compare free citizens to children . 
  there are unjust wars , and it is a moral imperative to * not * follow them . 
  if you follow laws just because they exist , well , that 's stepping right in line with a new autocratic system . 
   what if they knowingly show pictures of severely injured children from syria and present them as evidence of atrocities committed by your soldiers not our soldiers , but i can see that every night on the tagesschau . 
  and why would i want to hide that : those kids certainly did not hurt themselves , and people need a reminder sometimes that war is hell , or they become too fond of it . 
   unless they are n't , but are told that they should be . 
  so you distinguish between `` real '' unhappiness , and `` taught '' unhappiness ? 
  do you believe in the concept of free will ? 
   and anyways , if an insurrection can be democratic , then so can censorship . 
  censorship is inheriently undemocratic . 
   should democratic countries allow groups who wish to destroy said democracy ? 
  it 's not an easy question . 
  yes , it is , and the answer is `` yes '' . 
  if your people is so little convinced about democracy that such propaganda would sway them , your democracy is dead to begin with . 
   viasat wo n't take any responsibility if they will decide to `` rise up '' due to brainwashing in russian tv 's , right ? 
  if 30 % of a population is unhappy with how things are run , another 30 % do n't raise their voices because they 're indifferent , then we 're close to a majority for regime change . 
  which would be ... democratic . 
  remember : democracy is not an end to itself . 
  `` hey , look , i just pulled a big number out of my ass '' . 
  this is about investment losses ... which will eventually return . 
  investment losses also do n't immediately affect the population , so the $ 7000 figure is pretty much bullshit . 
  please be because censorship is wrong ... * click *  `` we are not restricting the broadcasting of the russian channels out of respect for the freedom of speech , '' said henrik toremark , mtg head of public affairs . 
  wonderful . 
  seems we all can learn a bit from these guys . 
  yeah , this pretty much a `` no true scotsman '' argument . 
  `` oh , those are n't * real * protestors , just criminals '', 
  wait . 
  euromaidan removes old government . 
  new `` government '' ( which only exists because of euromaidan ) starts to fight euromaidan ? 
  is the revolution already eating it 's children ? 
  and by `` similar '' , they mean `` black with arabic words on them '' . 
  which means she took away a flag mourning the civilian loss of life in gaza . 
  actually , we specifically have 1,5 % milk in germany , next to the 3,5 % liter , because more fat is said to be bad for you . 
  are we really cheering on people who obviously condone terrorist activity now , just because we do n't like their current democratically-elected leader ? 
  i mean , there 's an old guy in there who cheers on suicide bombers , a ton of youths dressed like eta members , a guy ( mustache , glasses ) positively talking about arson and mob violence . 
  and after all that , you have the western `` journalist '' describe their breeding ground as a `` friendly neighborhood '' . 
  what 's next ? 
  a picture series `` europe 's terrorist cells '' ? 
  the ode or the eu ? 
  because neither is about peace . 
   `` freude '' instead of `` frieden '' `` freedom '' translates to `` freiheit '' . 
  `` frieden means `` peace '' . 
  i disagree with your evaluation of the european union , it 's goals and it 's achievements . 
  it too misused this piece of art as a cheap propaganda device . 
  but i remember how i exactly felt like that , before i understood the realities . 
  never study political science if you want to continue believing in this . 
  so , he who buys the most ( and at the same time has a competitor knocking at their door ) , gets a rebate . 
  this is bad , ... how ? 
  because , it turns out , i 'm horrible when it comes to black sea geography . 
  i was rather sure that was on the crimea . 
  i guess that only makes the whole excercize even more pointless , though . 
  `` look , we managed to get about a hundred persons and a few music instruments into a room we claim to be an odessan airport terminal ~ ~ ( where it should be * crawling * with pro-russian security ) ~ ~ , to ( badly ^ 1 ) perform a piece of music your supranational body decided to take as a symbol , to show you how ` freedom-loving ' we are . 
  wo n't you please help us ? 
  oh , here , have some singing of our hymn and some flags so you do n't forget who we are . 
  ignore the shouts of slogans , you wo n't understand them anyhow . '', 
  [ 1 ] the tempo is n't right , i think they 're about a terz too high , and it 's massively cut short, 
  kinda defeats the message behind the ode . 
  i never said such a thing !, 
  i just said that the influence of `` independent bloggers '' , `` internet news '' and `` non-tabloid newssources '' is massively overestimated . 
  all it takes is the necessary bank account to buy two , maybe three influental newspapers , and you could cause havoc . 
  in fact , some say [ this has already happened ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rupert_murdoch ) . 
  or have an [ italian example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silvio_berlusconi#business_career ) . 
  give the people of europe easy explanations and tits , and the `` thinking for themselves '' soon will be replaced by whatever you want them to say . 
  gabriel is trying to position himself to become the next spd candidate for chancellorship ... and with him as their option , we 'll get four more years of merkel . 
  this is not about ethics . 
  it 's about the campaign trail . 
  to be fair , up until a few years ago , you just had to get a copy of the official us state department phone directory of the embassy - it only had state department employees on it , no intelligence agents ; so you knew whoever was not on that list , but accreddited as a diplomat was a spook . 
  see ? 
  they even let pirate vessels go . 
  clear violation of article 100 of the un convention on the law of the sea . 
  these monsters / s, 
  rhine to the west , alpine ridge to the right . 
   most europeans have access to independent media outlets , and are taught from a young age to think for themselves . 
  few do , though . 
  go to a newsstand and look at some tabloid headlines : that 's what most europeans are aligned to believe . 
  take control of the bild , the sun , and the like , and within 3 months , you can move europes political system anywhere you want to . 
  actually , it 's the same as the one of russia , today . 
  i guess they changed some lyrics , though . 
   that does sound like some pretty strong propaganda . 
  i am pretty sure if you staged something like that ( with roles reversed , think putin in stalin 's uniform shooting young girls in the face or the like ) in berlin , amsterdam or paris , public support for a military intervention would skyrocket just as much . 
  but we are more subtle . 
  we take an opportunity someone gave us , then without any indication about what exactly happened , we start spreading stories ( `` they 're stealing the flight recorder and bring it to russia '' , `` they 're stealing the corpses '' , `` they meant to shoot that down '' , `` we know for a fact it was the kremlin itself who pressed the button '' ) until it sounds believable . 
  it 's cheaper , too . 
  and this , exactly , is why i am * not * ok with the eu using a well-known piece of art as their `` hymn '' . 
  a song about essentially the joy of living becomes little more than a propaganda piece . 
  a very sad day , indeed . 
  also : raped version . 
  the original is  10 minutes long . 
   amazing that none of the specialists at the zoos has thought of that . 
  well , when i look at the news archive for `` danish zoo '' , i would question the general sanity of these `` specialists '' . 
  fibs3n might be onto something . 
  ... in front of children , so they can learn what 's inside them . 
  i hope those `` strict requirements '' include at least two doctors attesting a terminal , painful disease , and that the parents have absolutely no say in a go/no-go decision . 
  giving teenagers an easy way to commit suicide because of lovesickness would be a horrificly bad idea .
