  [ obligatory self-realization ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1vxamejru ), 
  all three are things that are illegal and/or non-existant in germany ... so the law has not exactly become less severe for us . 
  * abortion is illegal , but `` is not persecuted under certain circumstances '' ( see : \u00a7 218a bgb ) * there is no gay `` marriage '' , only civil unions ( and a subset of that existed long before anyone thought that might apply to homosexuals ) . 
  * euthanasia is * highly * illegal . 
  actually , it is cheaper because they can write it off their taxes as a deduction - which is a net plus , as compared to a net minus for having to call a waste disposal company to come and get it . 
  unfortunately , that leads to a lot of said food being actually * bad * , and extreme costs to the operators of such soup kitchens , who * then * have to pay to dispose the 50 % unedible food . 
  technically , the us slavery laws did not limit the rights of slaves , but allowed certain people to * own * slaves . 
  by abolishing these laws , the pre-existing rights of the slaveowners were diminished and the up-to-then perfectly legal practice of slave-owning suddenly became illegal - thus making the law stronger , not more relaxed . 
  enter [ the biogas plant ] ( http://energisesussexcoast.co.uk/our-biogas-plant/ ) - buy a truckload of unsellable food for a symbolic euro , get electricity . 
  the french agricultural sector in general , not the agricultural sector of the french poor . 
  do n't worry , the next time agrar subsidies are talked about , they will make berlin pay for that . 
  actually , whenever i am at the doctor ( ~ 2 times a year ) , there always are a ton of old people who are there every other day , often just to talk to the doctor ( because anyone else wo n't listen ) . 
   throwing away bread is more efficient than selling less because you ran out . 
  the point is more the customer stopping to come to your bakery alltogether if that happened a few times because `` why bother , they never have anything around anyways '' . 
   i think everyone agrees the plane was shot down now . 
  the disagreement is on who did it . 
  yes , it was shot down . 
  now , was it specifically targeted ( = attack ) , or was it an idiot at the controls/weapons system malfunction and the rocket got a plane noone actually wanted to shoot down ( = accident ) . 
   ou seem to think that if something is n't specifically mentioned in the nato treaty text , it 's `` illegal '' ( in what court ? ), 
  as much as i think international law is a joke : illegal by international law that prohibits wars of aggression . 
  there 's a reason why nato goes to ask the security council whenever things seem like a get-to-the-guns situation . 
   most of the passengers were citizens of nato countries . 
  does n't matter . 
  the word `` citizen '' does not appear in the north atlantic treaty . 
  the limits ( both what is protected and where ) are there for a reason : just because a us american citizen gets fatally run over by a car in beijing does not mean nato is entitled to full-out nuclear war against china . 
   unprovoked attacks on civilians is certainly more than enough to justify a response if there is something close ot a consensus among the members . 
  for that , you would have to prove it was an `` attack '' as compared to an `` accident '' , and you would have to show some hard proof who did it . 
   neither bosnia or kosovo were treaty states , were they ? 
  and thus nato involvment in these theatres was unlawful . 
   there is also the matter of the crash site . 
  which also is not in nato territory . 
   it 's a nato issue if nato decides to make it a nato issue . 
  which will happen when it 's against a small enemy who is not much of a threat , e.g. 
  serbia . 
  with russia , the cost/benefit ratio is just too bad . 
  heh , they should have done it the ** european ** way ( which is : the ** german ** way , a.k.a the `` mitst\u00f6rerhaftung '' ) . 
  allow free wifi 2 . 
  make the wifi operator personally responsible for everything that happens over their network . 
  which may include copyright claims , jailtime for kiddie porn , ... 3 . 
  ... wait 4 . 
  ... no anonymous wifi anymore . 
  read [ the actual treaty ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm ) : the mh17-incident did not 1 . include a plane of a nato member and 2 . did not happen over treaty territory thus : it 's not a nato issue . 
  not even close to a nato issue . 
  to be right , you would have to have a point , and i fail to see you having one . 
  all you have done by now was downvoting and declaring logic a `` silly semantic trick '' . 
  i do not consider wars genocidal that are proportionate . 
  if you hit me , i would be wrong in putting a [ 15-megaton-device into london ] ( http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;kt=15000&amp;lat=51.499167&amp;lng=-0.124722&amp;airburst=0&amp;hob_ft=0&amp;ff=68&amp;zm=10 ) . 
  a few larger fireworks rockets being shot at towns in your country do not make full-out 1000-civilian-casualties-per-week military engagement in any way legitimate . 
   i guess you 're conceding that every single war where anybody died was a genocide then . 
  i was just reaching for the lowhanging fruit . 
  a is not a genocide and a is a bloodless war does not logically lead to `` only bloodless wars can be non-genocidal '', 
  a bilateral trade agreement between an eu member state and a non-eu state by definition would not be a `` common '' commercial policy . 
   but since you are a block of nations , we can not just single one out , we must negotiate with the whole block . 
  huh ? 
  why is that ? 
  the eu does not prevent it 's member-states from making bilateral treaties . 
  did n't we already have that over the uk -  commonwealth-of-nations link ? 
   i 'm not being facetious at all : name me one war that is not a genocide by this definition . 
  any war , fought by any belligerent . 
  here you go : the [ three hundred and thirty five year 's war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_hundred_and_thirty_five_years'_war ) . 
  also , [ here are a few more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloodless_war ), 
  oh , it is . 
  there 's actually a pretty [ good definition of the term ] ( http://www.preventgenocide.org/genocide/officialtext-printerfriendly.htm ) , and the palestinian situation matches a surprisingly large part of it . 
  well , the 75 million euros overwhelmingly go to the bavarian state budget . 
  that equals about 6,03 $ per bavarian , taxes that have not to be raised elsewhere . 
  i 'd call that a win . 
  right . 
  but society as a whole has been better served with these 75 mio . 
  $ as compared to having to pay for a year or two of jail costs for ecclestone . 
  everyone wins . 
  with no word i condone the actions of a small terrorist organization operating from inside the gaza strip . 
  they should be dealt with , quickly , and efficiently . 
  israel does have the means to do so : they just need to take away the little leverage hamas has over gaza strip civilians : charity . 
  give the palestinians real support , give them water , electricity , food , and work - and they will not feel like the only way they could survive is to trust hamas - or iran . 
  give the palestinians something to lose , because if they got * nothing * to lose , they only will grow more dangerous . 
  instead , they choose to send in the idf , killing hundreds of people without getting closer to shut down hamas , thus perpetuating this conflict for the next fifty years . 
  ** edit ** : back-of-an-envelope peace plan . 
  specifics obviously have to be ironed out . 
   paragraph 153a just to be clear : stpo \u00a7 153a lists several ways a defendant can go to have the case closed . 
  they can * make sure the damage done by their deed has been repaired * pay a sum ( that 's determined by the court ) towards charity or the state * do `` other charitable acts '' ( = e.g. 
  appear in an ad , do a year with medicins sans frontiers , work in a soup kitchen ) * ( in alimony cases ) : pay alimony * ( in traffic cases ) : go to special training seminars for road safety . 
  which of the routes the defendant * has * to go is to be determined by the prosecutor ( before the case is given to the court ) or the court ( after it got the case ) . 
  \u00a7 153a is not a `` bribe yourself out of jail '' card . 
   there is nothing darker than war . 
  i beg to differ . 
  genocide is darker than war , and a modern , first-world military acting against what essentially is a third-world country actively attacking civilian areas ( and areas protected by geneva conventions ) is pretty close to genocide . 
  it is at least equally ridiculous to cheer on the willfull endangerment of civilians and obvious warcrimes because of that reason . 
  war is hell . 
  but this is n't a war anymore . 
  this is darker . 
   hamas has fired thousands of explosive rockets at israeli civilians [ it appears they are very bad at it then ... 40 casualties in ten years ] ( http://mondoweiss.net/2014/07/rocket-deaths-israel.html ) . 
  that 's about how many palestinians are dying every 12 hours or so . 
  talk about proportional response . 
  '' ... separated as soon as the go/no-go decision has been made '' ( as it was the case here ) . 
  this is a question of reliability , and we 're hurting ourselves if we reserve the right to just cancel any deal for any reason at any time . 
   its logo [ 1 ] would look great on a pack of some quality sour cream or cheese . 
  actually , that 's how street signs in munich ( and likely other places ) [ look like ] ( http://www.hotel-monaco.de/galerie-hotel-muenchen/mnchener-frhling-041.jpg ), 
  the first politician with a spine ... 
   the rank of germany as an arms exporter is n't at risk and the `` prevented '' deals only take place very selectively . 
  this single deal might not be much of an issue , but once berlin has started putting their noses in business that should not concern them , things are unlikely to stop .
