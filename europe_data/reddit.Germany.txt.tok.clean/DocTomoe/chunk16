  also , our rank as an arms exporter * is * at risk as soon as customers get the idea that their approved deals can be thrown out by random politicians at a moments notice . 
  the us deliver , so do china and russia . 
  '' [ lindenstra\u00dfe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lindenstra%c3%9fe ) '' ( our variant of the british `` coronation street '' ) . 
  a weekly soap about people having enough problems to send them into a closed psychiatric ward after one episode ... only it 's been going on since 1984 . 
  actually , as it reads , asian carriers are not affected right now . 
  which means more money to asian carriers , and financial problems to european ones . 
   so , do regular germans think the warsaw uprising was a good thing for the polish to do ? 
  there is hardly a consensus , and the matter gets entangled with anything ghetto . 
  in fact , a lot of people will likely think it was mostly a jewish uprising with some sympathizing polish running around there . 
  was it a good thing ? 
  actually , i do think it was the same you saw in iraq , ca . 
  2004-2007 : a grassroots `` terrorist '' ( in fact , the wehrmacht used that exact word to describe it ) situation doing asymmetrical warfare against a massively militarily superior foe . 
  insofar , it was to be expected that the `` uprising '' was doomed from the beginning . 
  what it bought the polish was mostly post-war bragging rights . 
  so , was it worth it ? 
   its been really hot people are starting to complain about it [ 3 ] ( the express is a joke of a paper but i had to provide a link ) . 
  86 \u00b0 f = 30 \u00b0 c = 303.15 kelvin ... warm , but hardly `` hot '' . 
   so they are basically saying though luck , what are you going to do about it ? 
  does n't sweden have antiaircraft systems ? 
  ah , the good old `` i 'm all for plurality and freedom of opinion , as long as it is my opinion '' route . 
  that worked so well the last time . 
  some of us actually do work for our living , kefeng . 
  that are the ones who prefer our politicians to not shoot our economy in the foot . 
  but amuse me , if you think my statement that this is a bad decision cost/benefit-wise is `` idiotic '' : we do need the ukraine ... why ? 
  ( alternatively : our economy will be unaffected , because ? ), 
  when i look at [ this nice list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_aircraft_of_the_malaysian_armed_forces ) , the malaysian af seems to be a very balanced customer , not dependant on any single producer . 
  it is refreshing to see the country that was directly affected by the accident/shootdown of that aircraft is the only one not immediately trying to get political brownie points out of it . 
  europe likes money and jobs . 
  the us produces their own stuff , so there 's really one big other player in the market . 
  yep , hurting our economy for unimportant countries and their inability to either solve their own problems or bend over and take it . 
  what a glorious and smart move . 
  next in this theatre : opening our gold reserves for the greeks to take what they want . 
  yes . 
  and one of those `` experts '' was the guy they wanted to bring over here . 
  seems the non-pressure-suit method works really well . 
  this might shock you , but most countries and almost all universities nowadays do not make doctors swear the oath - for instance , it would prevent doctors from doing surgery . 
  that vehicle in picture 2 is ... somewhat cute . 
  does anyone know the model designation ? 
   also , assimilated ? 
  the vast majority is , the rest is largely integrated . 
  yeah . 
  let me show you through kreuzberg . 
  or hasnbergl . 
  just because most immigrants you know are able to speak b2-level german does not mean they 're assimilated - or integrated , for that matter . 
  there are aspects other than language that play a role here , like cultural norms . 
   or is it impossible to be german and also be muslim ? 
  it is not * impossible * . 
  i somewhat sloppily used `` muslim '' as shorthand for `` immigrants of near-east descent '' . 
   how come the turk next door talks just like me maybe your neighbor is , in fact , assimilated into the majority culture already . 
   what is this leidkultur you want us all to assimilate into ? 
  define it , please . 
  i guess that 's a freudian slip . 
  the `` leitkultur '' is a somewhat bad construct for it was created as a political assault term and in itself is not defineable . 
  of course we do - as a culture - agree some things are unacceptable , for example killing your younger sister because of her boyfriend or using excessive amounts of violence in the subway . 
  we do believe in the legal equality between the sexes . 
  we do not consider blasphemy to be a crime worthy of death . 
  and we do not try to create small state-like spheres within the majority culture that work outside of the laws of the land . 
  we know to communicate , we need to speak and understand the majority culture , and if we move somewhere to live there permanently , we better learn it . 
  it 's many small things . 
  i am not crazy , you just are incapable of reading in a foreign language . 
  ** in no word i condoned genocide ** . 
  i explained how a subset of a population can get hated , and eventually experience violence against them . 
  obviously you can not distinguish between describing a process and thinking said process is a good idea . 
   killing the danish football team denmark has a football team ? 
  the majority is not assimilated and cause problems *** such as *** staging undesireable protests . 
  highlighted the keywords for you . 
  i thought it is pretty clear i talked about the subset of a subset . 
  pray , what do you think do people cough and sneeze out ? 
  could it be ... bodily fluids ? 
  like , infectous material ? 
  or is such material suddenly sterile when it leaves the body through a nose or the mouth ? 
  i guess all those doctors who treat ebola patients in pressure suits are in some way insane , huh ? 
  indirectly , yes . 
  the irish situation did not just come out of nowhere in the late 1960s . 
  directly from your link :  ebola does not spread through coughing and sneezing but only by coming into contact with body fluids of persons suffering from the viral disease . 
  that 's * exactly * what a `` tr\u00f6pfcheninfektion '' is - aka `` airborne disease '' . 
  patient coughs , stuff gets inhaled by up-to-that-point healthy person , bam , infected . 
   the same way the catholicism was the motivation behind the ira 's violent actions . 
  which is to say , none at all . 
  yeah , go and tell that to the british ... or the irish . 
   ostracized ? 
  you mean threatened , beaten up , discriminated against , boycotted , have their businesses vandalized and more or less forced to leave the country yes , obstracized . 
  there was antisemitism in germany before ' 33 . 
   contrary to what the `` st\u00fcrmer '' says , jews usually do n't look that different from other germans and were blending in just fine . 
  i am not talking about phenotypes . 
  i 'm talking cultural differences , names , different customs - in which yes , they were very noticeable . 
   are you serious ? 
  the holocaust was the fault of the jews ? 
  i know people , especially people living in the same country as i do , like to think of perfectly innocent groups of victims . 
  there is no such thing , hate does not just materialize from thin air , it is created with a certain number of bad experiences with a group of people . 
  in some areas , it might have been the jewish cattle trader who ( willfully ? ), 
  sold sick cows , in others , it might have been the banker who evicted `` good germans '' , and in even others , there might have been a jewish family who did particularily well , creating something germans know even today : sozialneid . 
  that the group stood out particularily easily did not make it harder to hate the group , not the individuals . 
  these feelings , even if they were created only eventually became a stereotype , and stereotypes eventually can be ignited to hate . 
  what that ends in we have all seen . 
  nowadays , we have the very same thing : we might never have had troubles with turkish youths , but when we are approached by a group of them , we prepare to fight or flight . 
  we might never have had anything taken from us by a sinti/roma/gypsy ^ 1 , and still when they come to park in our neighborhood , we make sure to lock our bikes extra well ... and do n't get me started with polish car transporters driving through well-off neighborhoods at night , very slowly . 
  note : i do not condone in any way the horrific crimes of the 20 ^ th century . 
  i just want to point out that nothing happens out of the blue . 
  [ 1 ] yes , there are those of them who want to be called that ...
