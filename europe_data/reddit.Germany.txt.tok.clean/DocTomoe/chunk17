  the who link does n't discuss airborne transmission . 
  the cdc one lists several transmissions , using language that indicates there might be other ways . 
  the rki recommends `` kontakt - und tr\u00f6pfchen-isolierung `` isolation ( = of patients and protection gear against `` tr\u00f6pfcheninfektion '' = airborne transmission . ), 
  i 'd say the cards are open . 
  yeah , because the distinction is irrelevant . 
  antijewish persecution did not make some statistic where they saw that x % of the german-jewish population was well-assimilated - it picked out the most `` outrageous '' examples and pulled them into the spotlight . 
   you think the holocaust happened because jews were n't assimilated or integrated into german society . 
  wtf . 
  you only are a minority if you are in some way distinguishable as said minority . 
  if you are n't distinguishable , thus assimilated , there is no way your group can become a target . 
   israel was established with jews fighting tooth and nail for it . 
  oh , i am aware of that . 
  [ it was the example that showed us religiously motivated anti-state terrorism works as a catalyst for building a state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zionist_political_violence ) . 
  the jews having had the shoah was a convinient way for the british to hand over infertile land that only came with violence and save face at the same time . 
  today , there are many assimilated muslim migrants in germany . 
  the majority , still , is n't assimilated and causes problems ( such as , for example , staging protests in which they call for all jews to be killed ) . 
  guess which ones we do have an issue with ? 
   '' these protesters ( against israel 's gaza operation ) don ` t know how to say ` hello ` in german , but they know very well how to shout that israel is fascist and cruel , '' he said . 
  a politician from a nation that only exists because it 's people were obstracized in germany ( and elsewhere ) based on their refusal to blend in with the majority culture - and got into a very nasty genocide for that - attacks another population in germany on grounds that they do not blend in enough into the majority culture ? 
   `` if you do not stand by our side , the day when islamic terror will reach your homes , your beds and your kindergartens will come soon , '' he warned . 
  actually , i would argue standing by israel is the one major way to get into radical-islamist crosshairs . 
  that 's very selective quoting . 
  they do establish that airborne transmission is possible . 
  i would , but the [ canadians have been four years faster ] ( http://healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/pigs-monkeys-ebola-goes-airborne-112112 ) ... 
  i do fully agree with that . 
  it 's a humanitarian catastrophe . 
  i 'm not anti-sierra-leoneans , i 'm just anti-pathogens-in-my-neighborhood . 
   if a western hospital can safely handle hiv or hepatitis patients they can also safely handle an ebola patient . 
  [ this is how hiv patients are treated in a western hospital ] ( http://images.counselheal.com/data/images/full/5011/patient-doctor-hospital.jpg?w=600 ) [ and this is how an ebola patient is treated in a western hospital ] ( http://www.aerztezeitung.de/docs/2004/12/03/2003-050a0101.jpg ) can you spot the difference ? 
  there 's a reason tropical diseases are pretty much only treated in major university clinics over here . 
  i am well aware that ebola spreads by direct contact , contact with fecal matter and airborne infection , thank you very much . 
  i also am aware that virii sometimes mutate . 
  just wait when mr. kunnunen suddenly demands a free republic lapland and gets a norwegian antiaircraft system . 
  yeah ... we usually do stupid stuff twice . 
  well , experts experimented with the marburg virus ... until it escaped . 
  experts controlled grundremmingen-a right into an accident that destroyed the reactor . 
  experts often overestimate their capabilities . 
  sometimes , common sense is the right path to follow . 
  given that the ukrainians are shelling civilian buildings , there are no innocents in such a war . 
  also , i have no illusions such a conflict could very well become much larger than the ukraine , and probably would involve us in some capacity . 
  which would be devastating , at first . 
  but sometimes , you have to burn grasslands for new life to come . 
  inviting people over which have a sickness that 's highly contagious and extremely deadly is not a good idea . 
  i 'd pay serious money for such a game . 
  well , i start to wish they would just start moving in so we get this situation over with , and quickly . 
  the ukrainian/western propaganda is getting unbearable . 
  seriously , whoever thought that was a good idea should get fired from his/her respective position . 
  either that , or migrants have some kind of strange canary function when it comes to unseaworthy vessels . 
  this guy is an officer . 
  he openly criticizes his superiors in the media . 
  we call that insubordination , and pretty much every military penal code has sanctions against this . 
  move on , nothing to see here . 
  you know you 're screwed when the british house of lords , of all organizations , acts as the voice of reason . 
  `` german synagoge that was burned down by the nazis in ' 38 '' is kinda redundant and only used to link arson related to the israeli-palestinian conflict to the third reich . 
  seriously , who would have imagined that if i make renting unattractive for landlords , new flat construction might take a dip ? 
  / s i think hollande is actively hurting his country , and should step down . 
  just saying that the number of ships sinking once they are boarded by immigrants/refugees is surprisingly high . 
   was n't the sa purged after the night of long knives and basically nonexistent afterwards ? 
  they were decimated , but not purged and continued to exist , with eventually plummeting numbers ( because their members transferred to the wehrmacht ) numbers , right up to may 1945 . 
   after that , the nazi regime developed a strongly anti-gay identity , and ended up sending thousands of gays to the extermination camps : it could be a case of `` he doth protest too much '' - and even the `` high '' number of 15k makes it seem like a token , an easy excuse to get someone into the camps . 
  read on about the history of the sa . 
  it very much was r\u00f6hm 's specially-selected group of guys - people he knew from his wrestling courses . 
  was the sa some kind of 100 % - homosexual army ? 
  surely not . 
  but their main guys were , at least into 1935 . 
  and their body cult did not come from nowhere , either . 
  read on . 
  there are r\u00f6hm 's letters . 
  please note how they did not specify in * which * week . 
  money shot :  but its reputation for street violence and heavy drinking was a hindrance , as was the open homosexuality of r\u00f6hm and other sa leaders such as his deputy edmund heines . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] one american journalist would later write , '' [ r\u00f6hm 's ] chiefs , men of the rank of gruppenfuehrer or obergruppenfuehrer , commanding units of several hundred thousand storm troopers , were almost without exception homosexuals . 
  '' [ 7 ] in 1931 , the m\u00fcnchener post , a social democratic newspaper , obtained and published r\u00f6hm 's letters to a friend discussing his homosexual affairs . 
  actually , it is pretty much considered a historic fact that major nsdap members , especially within the sa , were in fact homosexual . 
  yeah , it 's been a while since we played ... those . 
  of course , either choice would have been horrible . 
  radetzky only is acceptable in vienna , every january 1st . 
  ca n't decide if that 's clever or horrific . 
  comes in with the ~ ~ radetzky ~ ~ march ... that 's when i noped out of that . 
  i want to take this opportunity to apologize to an obviously more cultured and saner neighbor for anything we might have done in the last thousand years or so . 
  switzerland . 
  great cheese , great chocolate , nice scenery , people a little reserved , but `` true originals '' . 
  oh , look , they used `` gay '' as a derogatory thing in a testosterone-filled environment . 
  what monsters ... only that it 's [ rather widespread ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyfsdj1j5vw ) . 
  looks like it 's no good against a few separatists ... 
  i guess by now that 's a statement that 's universally considered to be true - like the plane not having arrived at all . 
  what the interesting question is : whodunit , and was it deliberate or an accident . 
  it 's probably a bad idea to write while suffering from dehydration :p thank you for this correction . 
  well , the wh ( = wehrmacht ) did n't exist until 1935 , and the list of war crimes and ideals that follow you ~ ~ are kinda incompatible ~ ~ do n't really match that much with it 's precedessor , the reichswehr . 
   yes , not all of german soldiers were bloodthirsty maniacs , but let 's not forget that wh this article is about wwi , not wwii . 
  ... implying the english team manages to somehow magically pass through qualification . 
  actually , they very carefully and very skillfully made sure the us stood in the other corner , unable to move . 
   most of those people are now benefiting from democracy . 
  actually , most postsoviet republics today are dictatorships or unstable regimes , noteable exceptions are the baltics . 
  any by proxy , the world 's . 
  if you make people stand in a corner , they wo n't be able to evade you by stepping back - they only got the option to aggressively attack as long as they still can . 
   create more trauma to families and the rest of the dutch by telling them its not worth the cost s to try to find out what happened to their citizens . 
  that would be an `` investigation '' . 
  this article is about a `` war crime investigation '' = the dutch already think they knew what happened and now try to justify further steps . 
  which is very different from an open-ended investigation . 
   where are you from ?
