  there is no sense in getting involved in a civil war . 
  ah , come on , that 's nothing ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icoo7ut1p4y this guy was the governor of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  then we dumped his ass to somewhere he ca n't do much damage : the eu . 
  remember , that 's the same cameron who threatened ( again ) to leave the eu only four weeks ago . 
  and now he wants a stronger eu response . 
  talk about being a hypocrite . 
  we call those people `` kidnappers '' . 
  terrorists kidnap people and cut their heads off on live pre-dinner tv to make a point . 
  well , all it takes is one quick [ google images search ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=flight+recorder&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=bhfmu9ecjyg7ygoi1ohoaw&amp;ved=0cbsqsaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=683#q=flight+recorder+777&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  not exactly rocket science . 
   the main task of ukrainian government is to prove their guilt now , so all efforts are for it . 
  and what would that accomplish for kiev , exactly ? 
  so instead of an antonov , rebels accidentally downed an airliner . 
  that 's tragic . 
  but i fail to see how this has any relevancy to solving the conflict . 
  oh , there are now terrorists in the eastern part of the ukraine ? 
  what acts of terror have happened ? 
  no , rebels/insurgents/freedom fighters are not terrorists . 
  the definition of terrorism is not met . 
  of course , talking about `` terrorists '' is great for propaganda and getting some attention in a post-9 / 11-world . 
  actually , if it was n't for / r/europe and ukrainian spinnsters , i 'd likely have forgotten about this irrelevant conflict in a third-world-country weeks ago . 
  your `` press around the world '' is rather silent about the whole thing ( with the notable exception of the tragedy of the last two days ) . 
  make it disneyland boring resort . 
  and this , ladies and gentlemen , is why i am in favor for the legality of a nuke in every citizen 's hand - to deter the state from defending something that is not legally theirs . 
  meanwhile , ukrainian propaganda is busy spamming reddit . 
  [ well , what might they do about it , i wonder ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction ), 
  the cdu should recruit our part of the peacekeepers from those cdu members who got that kind of idea . 
  it 's always easy to send in troops if it 's not you yourself who has to go . 
  a sam system is hardly a wmd . 
  yes , this thing might have killed 300 people . 
  wmds are a little bit ... more deadly , though . 
  and it is the nature of a plea that it can be denied . 
  which is the sane way to go . 
  yes . 
  we have no justification for protesting russian involvation in the donetzk , luhansk , abkhazian , transnistrian , alanian or nagorno-karabachian de-facto regimes if we have boots on the ground in the kosovarian de-facto regime . 
  also , it 's none of our business . 
  the neglectful death of civilians is not an act of war . 
  and the north atlantic treaty clearly states that it is about vehicles carrying the flag , not passports . 
  on what basis ? 
  neither the ukraine , nor russia , nor malaysia is in the eu or nato . 
  there is no basis for an intervention . 
  thank $ deity . 
   is this an act of war against the nations of civilians killed , legally ? 
  legally , it 's destruction of property . 
  for an act of war , you 'd have to proove the plane was shot down , and it was intended to be shot down - an accident does n't matter much . 
  see korean 007 or iran air 655 . 
   is nato obliged to be called upon to defend the other nations ? 
  malaysia is not part of nato . 
   are we looking at troops on the ground , increased sanctions , or no response ? 
  no response , a week of public outcry , and longer flight routes . 
  the alternative would be no taxes in a country that historically has had an abstrusly high percentage of tax cheating , and rapidly going bankrupt , which would hurt even more people . 
  [ so do americans ] ( http://www.myvideo.de/watch/8197565/weird_al_yankovic_party_in_the_cia_parody_of_party_in_the_u_s_a_by_miley_cyrus ), 
  and this , ladies and gentleman , is why we seem to not be able to finish construction of ber - we reallocated airport-building resources to a more worthy project . 
  now we are just nitpicking . 
   in short : if someone has a bigger buddy they can call you should take it up the arse from them . 
  if you try to do something about that you 're the one at fault . 
  pretty much , yes . 
  that 's one of the main reasons noone fucks with smaller nations . 
   no santa and his crew . 
  of course . 
  i would have hoped for a source . 
  but maybe i should have asked more directly . 
   what serious firepower ?? 
  well , you do n't think nato would just have given them a nice cozy seat next to the fireplace , right ? 
   are you also with the iipb there ? 
  false dictinomy - just because you happen to think the right for self-determination of the chechen people should not be violated does not make you a sympathisant for terrorist organizations . 
   oh i forgot , geopolitics justifies all wars . 
  well i guess we better start then . 
  especially a belgian should realize that justification is irrelevant . 
  we 're talking about realpolitik here . 
   seriously . 
  what have they gained ? 
  who is the `` they '' you 're refering to ? 
  they have made nato involvement toxic for a few more years . 
  they also have shown that they are well able and willing to defend their sphere of influence , they 're not as toothless as the west might have thought post - ' 92 . 
  south ossetia ? 
  they have not again become a part of a country where their ethnicity is considered to be an enemy people and to be ethnically cleansed . 
  independence is worth something . 
  they also got some international recognition , which is nice . 
   the aggressor against who ? 
  south ossetia ? 
  yes . 
  given south ossetia is allied with russia , georgia should have known better . 
   oh man i can already hear the world crying murder because they did anything to hamper their attacks / s south-ossetian attacks against georgians in 2008 pre-war ? 
   oh right , damn . 
  that justifies the war . 
  oh wait it fucking does n't . 
  hell yes , it does . 
  if you move in serious firepower right next to my borders , that 's an aggressive act , and preemtive self-defense is justified . 
   do n't you think that what georgia was about to do was surprisingly similar to what rufed did in chechnya ? 
  yep , and i am on the chechenian side in that conflict . 
  self-determination of peoples and such . 
    [ russian response ]  a damn one sided response is n't it . 
  but if you think fighting russia is a good idea - like georgian politicians seem to have thought - do n't come back complaining about the bruises . 
   they wanted that war and geopolitics does n't justify it . 
  yes , it does . 
  why would they decline a free meal handed to them on a golden plate ? 
  alright , off now ^ soccer time, 
  [ ] ( / indignantcelestia ) yes , there are a ton of possible diplomatic solutions .
