   why not ? 
  by using evil means , you yourself have become evil . 
  the result , intended of finalized , therefore can not be truly righteous . 
   most hong kong chinese citizen did devellop a hong kong identity of chinese culture but not communist . 
  there is no inherent preservation of the status quo in such situations . 
  if hong kong wants to secede , they should be given the opportunity to do so - though if they 're not allwoed , the only way would be a civil war - and let 's face it , realigning your political views is less problematic than actually dying . 
   look at taiwan for example . 
  oh , you talk about the de-facto regime without international recognition ( whose recognizion this democratic west took away ) which for some reason considers itself a state that 's still at war with the prc , and which still stares down prc troops every other year ? 
  yeah , that 's a great example . 
  yeah , you 're right !, 
  let 's bomb bomb bomb beijing !, 
  or maybe we can do the right thing and have the chinese deal with their own issues . 
  just like we did with ukraine . 
   second , olympics seem to have become a showpiece for dictatorships . 
  that 's because democratic societies and their public opinions are heavily leaning against the olympics , for obvious reasons . 
  i 'd wager we wo n't see olympics in democratic countries for quite some time now . 
  because there 's a typo in the headline . 
  what they really mean is : `` the eu could *** pay *** for a 50 km rail tunnel '', 
  the one thing you should have learned about german tactics in the last hundred years or so is that we have no issue making a deal with satan himself if we deem it necessary . 
  that being said , you could argue the presence of us forces in germany was more a liability than a protection . 
  i agree . 
  so let 's cause the largest possible loss of enemy life . 
  because that 's what nukes are designed to do . 
  heh , you think i fell for the `` to defend '' newspeak for the old word `` to occupy '' . 
  i am aware on that part of nuclear strategy ... and i am also aware that russia has a few very creative ways for ensuring second strike capability ( like , for instance , constantly driving their nukes around even in peacetime instead of storing them in silos ) . 
  if a strike devastating the second strike capability becomes impractical , you no longer have a reason not to just hit them hard . 
   it can easily be a force for good . 
  you can not do righteous things by evil means . 
  hey , you finally got the message . 
  that was n't so hard now , was it ? 
  i do n't even mean this to be sarcastic : this is what the majority of germans do believe . 
   and you plan to project power to defend the baltics/scandinavia , why would we want to defend the baltics or scandinavia ? 
  all they ever did for us was abba and ikea , and those guys did n't do anything in the last few years or got ridiculously expensive for deteroriating quality . 
   provide humanitarian interventions oh , do n't worry ... the refugees will come to us just fine . 
   secure trade routes with a shoe-string budget ? 
  find better trade routes , do n't need a budget at at . . 
   they should do more to sway opinion . 
  hero cults are considered a little dated and heavily scrutinized over here , to the point that `` hero '' itself has become more a sarcastic word than one invoking images of heroism . 
  that kind of propaganda wo n't work here anymore in the forseeable future . 
  the point is that differently from the us , you do n't need that many nukes to eradicate russia . 
  their infrastructure is way more centralized , their population more densely spread . 
  ah , those were the times ... viewmax forever . 
  same surveillance , worse search results . 
  yeah , i can see that service go far . 
  yes , yes , i am a nazi . 
  and my american friends want to give me the tools i so desperately lack to overthrow all of the world . 
  / s sometimes , i wonder if us-flavored jingoism literally kills most of an infected brain . 
  you said tuvalu is excused because they 're small . 
  i said that comparatively , the netherlands are small as well . 
   the matter of fact is that history shows and logic dictates that if you are not willing or not able to protect those interests then they will be lost to someone who is . 
  what history had shown is that the time we had ridiculously little military spending also was the most propserous timespan , and the longest time we have had peace in written history within our borders . 
   that being said , a heightened sense of military cohesion between the eu , led by the big 3 that drive it only help europe 's aims in the long run . 
  the problem with that idea is that german interests are not british interests are not french interests ( and , for that matter , are not cypriot interests ) , and heightened military cohesion would eventually lead to troops fighting wars for other eu countries against their people 's best interests . 
  now , how you are going to explain to a population that their sons return in body bags because for some reason someone in brussles dislikes a people 's right to self-determination in one case , but not another one ... you will have to make some kind of propaganda narrative , give them a bogeyman ... 
  such use of military forces will likely cause enough tension within germany to shut down the eu project completely . 
   that being said , i doubt that many still fear that merkel will lead a nuclear-powered fourth reich out from the dark heart of europe . 
  go ask the greeks :p . you are aware that germany , in fact , is considered a '' [ screwdriver-nation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paranuclear ) '' ? 
  it 's not a question of us being morons . 
   that is not true as we did have a strong military during the cold war and it was n't the ss . 
  ... for very low values of `` strong '' . 
  the common joke was that the bundeswehr was good for keeping the russians distracted until a real army comes . 
  very little , but then , i do n't think `` military superheroes '' when i hear `` netherlands '' , either . 
   i mean , i do n't even remember anybody criticizing the dutch over srebrinca or europe in general over the balkans . 
  had the dutch not send troops into that region , they would n't have been blamed for what happened there : noone blames , for example , tuvalu for the massacres . 
  the us has started [ no less than 60 military conflicts since 1800 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_the_united_states ) ( i even removed the ones which the us only decided to meddle with after some time ) . 
  i dare you to give me a nation who out-wared them in that time period . 
  you can be a warmonger without being a nazi . 
  reference : united states . 
  being aware of the danger of higher military spending and warning of likely results is sensible , not an insult . 
  technically , germany was created in 1871 . 
   you 're going to turn into a nazi , start slaughtering jews no , that 's so 1930s . 
  i 'm saying if all you have is a hammer , suddenly any problem you encounter looks like a nail . 
  which is bad news for our neighbors . 
  still , the us leads by a large margin . 
  well , apple should just pull out of the eu market and make a campaign how they do not sell in areas that are anti-freedom . 
  it 's a game of media manipulation ( `` tax evaders '' vs. `` freedom '' ) , and differently from the eu , apple has a stellar track record in media manipulation . 
  well , look no further as to your own home turf to see what a large military does to a nation : the us has the largest military , and started the most wars in the last two centuries . 
   spend what you are supposed to as the richest country in europe we do n't believe in half measures . 
  it 's either the swiss guards or the waffen-ss , regardless of if you 're german , us-american , or chinese . 
  damned if we do , damned if we do n't . 
  if you got a strong military , eventually , you would use it , and the last time we did we left four years of brutal war on everyone 's front door . 
  better only have a ceremonial one . 
   why is the historical stadtschloss from 15th century a monstrosity because it wo n't be the `` historical stadtschloss from 15 ^ th century '' , not even a pre-war variant of it , but [ this monstrosity ] ( http://www.sbs-humboldtforum.de/files/media/cdn.php?params=%7b%22id%22%3a%22mdb-e8db34b5-439f-4e2d-b616-ec212c7462f6-mdb%22%2c%22type%22%3a%22image%22%2c%22date%22%3a1385470156%2c%22chain%22%3a%22c0_0_1000_581.max320_0.q85%22%7d&amp;20120918_belvedere_klein.jpg ) , complete with brutalist facade and virtually no relation to the original building . 
  trying to rebuild this thing on a street that already has enough hohenzollerian buildings , and having torn down a very innovative building which itself was a focal point of a very large part of our nation 's history , which was more a community center than a parliament , is a sin to our future . 
   can you get cell phone reception at 30,000 feet ? 
  does n't necessarily need to be cell phone coverage ( though i think that would be possible ) . 
  think five or ten years from now when voip from your mobile phone will be more ubiquious , and airlines providing hotspots for laptop use , you wo n't need cell coverage anymore . 
  `` silent '' in the sense of `` no cell phone usage , thus no talking on cell phones '' , not in the sense of `` no music without headphones '' . 
  a lot similar to what the deutsche bahn does with it 's '' [ ruheabteile ] ( http://static.hogenkamp.com/old/2006/10/aufkleberruheabteil.jpg ) '' , only enforced because of contractual liability . 
  if there is no cell signal in the air , how were the 9/11 flight passengers able to call their families from their cell phones ? 
  well , because we , too , did not remember history . 
  worse then lenin ( which at least made for a good scene in a recent movie ) , though , was the demolition of the * palast der republik * and the monstrosity they 're building on that spot now . 
  [ yeah , but only technically ] ( https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fwirtschaft%2fservice%2froaming-mobilfunkanbieter-nutzen-gesetzesluecke-a-986635.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  ( warning : google translate version ), 
  while this is the defeatist solution to the problem , i can but hope airlines will still enforce house rules - good ones will understand there 's a market for `` silent '' flights , and will act accordingly . 
  so , you do believe by making a service * worse * ( from the standpoint of the sender ) , they would somehow become a trendsetter ? 
  for the sake of energy security , that statistics should make us want russia to completely take over ukraine : the less transit states , the less chance of stuff going wrong with delivery .

  `` expert '' ? 
  more like `` jack of all trades , master of none '' .
