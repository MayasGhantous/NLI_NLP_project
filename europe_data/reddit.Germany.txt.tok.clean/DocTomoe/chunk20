  us policy , though , is a show of force , and overwhelmingly so . 
  not that this is in any way relevant to the fictious equivalent situation i was designing to explain to you what actually did happen . 
  i also am able to answer to the post i do not disagree with without resorting to insulting the poster . 
  i do n't need to wonder who is the shill here . 
   the thing with that was russia anticipating the georgian response to ossetian provocations and attacks . 
  we call that politics , and good strategic planning . 
  if you realize your potential enemy is about to roll in tanks , you better make sure you 're prepared . 
   they had peacekeepers in the area , they knew what was going on , they did nothing . 
  doing anything in that kind of situation would have made * them * the aggressor - something russia clearly did n't want to look like . 
   hell hours before the attacks there was still a negotiation sought by the georgians but the ossetians did n't show and russia 's chief negotiator in the area `` had a flat tire '' . 
  what kind of policy making is that ? 
  `` meet us for negotiations , or expect to be bombed ? '', 
   i think georgia was at fault for letting themselves get lured out of their den but russia was no angel . 
  there never are angels in uniforms . 
  but there 's justified response - georgia was on the brink of becoming a nato country , and us warships were in the area to support the georgian offensive logistically . 
  this clearly was a serious threat for russia . 
  just imagine if russians suddenly started working with cuba and built a base there , maybe to set up middle-range nuclear weapons . 
  oh , wait , that happened , and it almost triggered ww3 . 
  so , the russian response was quick , it was decisive , and most importantly , it was appropriate and it was proportional - russia , even though nothing would have stopped them , did n't demand any more territory or reparations from georgia . 
  they did just enough for georgia to stop the attacks on south ossetia . 
   south ossetia . 
  south ossetia is a very small part of former georgian territory which has been self-governed for over a decade now - with georgia unable to prove their claim over it by actually enforcing their policies there . 
  it also is governed by south ossetians , who might ethnically be russians , but not by moscow . 
   so the only alternative for eu 's passivity would be go to war with russia . 
  this debate is getting boring real quick . 
  in the end , it 's let soviet ex-republics fight their war between themselves , or fight on one side of that conflict . 
  / r/europe considers not taking actions to be the act of cowardice here - what else than being passive is there ? 
   who said something about overthrowing russias dictator . 
  first , even though this might be an unpopular opinion , putin is by no mans a dictator . 
  he follows their constitution to their letter , he accepts his term limits , he is democratically elected . 
  [ he has a 86 % approval rating within russia ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-26/why-putin-is-in-trouble-with-86-approval.html ) . 
  there is a tendency on reddit to call anyone whose policy the hivemind does n't like a dictator . 
  remember bush ii ? 
  people here ask for `` regime change '' . 
  we have seen how western-influenced regime change looked in kiev , where a democratically-elected president ordering insurgents to leave public places and public buildings they illegally occupied , and when they not followed that order , he moved in people to shoot them as something ** evil ** , but when a few months later a self-declared `` government '' orders insurgents to leave public places and illegally-occupied government buildings , lest they move in the army to shoot them is ** very , very morally ok ** . 
  it sure feels good to always be on the right side , huh ? 
  [ ] ( / spikefacepalm ) if costa rica had a border dispute with panama and bombed a panamaian village near the border , and suddenly the us moves in with all they have to protect their interests in panama , costa rica still would be considered the aggressor . 
  that is what happened here . 
  who started the military operation ? 
  hint : it was not russia . 
  actually , i did not add the [ 1 ] . 
  this might be res playing a prank on you . 
  and of course , there are tons of quotes and references in my link - you might want to re-read them . 
  as should everyone who believed your assertion . 
   it was that he has a viable business and the economic situation is so crazy that still he 's left starving . 
  any my point is that if he 's left starving , he does *** not *** have a viable business . 
   and there 's also the case that all that tax money never gets back to the people of greece . 
  yes . 
  that 's because the greek people got it * beforehand * as a * loan * . 
  with that , they financed a public sector ( = jobs & economy ) that was unsubstainable , a military ( = jobs & economy ) that is unsubstainable and keynesian building ( e.g. 
  the athen olympic places , which means jobs & economy ) that was unsubstainable . 
  eventually , you have to pay back loans . 
   paying high taxes to sustain an unsustainable un-repayable , exponentially increasing national debt makes no sense . 
  you sound like originally , they all were tax-paying , law-abiding citizens who never cheated on their tax declarations . 
  which ... frankly , is not true . 
   people wanting high taxes is a matter of redistribution and public services . 
  yep . 
  they already got the services . 
  now it 's time to cough up some euros to pay the piper . 
   it 's stupid to say that someone making 20000 a year is too poor . 
  in other countries , the tax would be low enough so that he could make a living . 
  check your local tax code and see . 
  i know my local tax code . 
  that 's why i had to give up my business ( which yielded a little more than what this fellow claims ) a few years ago - suddenly-mandatory health insurance for the self-employed put my income lower than what is considered `` poverty '' over here . 
   nevertheless russia invaded and now controls it . 
  russia controls georgia ? 
  i guess someone should tell the georgian government . 
   not everything has to be about pragmatism . 
  yes , it has to be about pragmatism . 
  there are 400 million people within the eu who overwhelmingly would rather continue to live than be put into a senseless war between two ex-soviet republics . 
   ukraine borders europe . 
  do we really want constant aggression and war on our borders . 
  it 's not if we want it or not . 
  we play the cards we 're dealt . 
   when ukraine situation calms down , we can be pretty certain russia will go at it again with someone else . 
  because thats how putin keeps his position . 
  as slippery a slope as you get . 
  who else would be in the fireing line ? 
  nato countries obviously are n't ... and everyone else we care little about . 
  also , if nato has learned one thing out of the iraq debacle it 's that it is good to have one strong man controlling something as compared to an area descending in chaos once you get rid of them . 
  ah , look , it 's that discussion again . 
  so , the ukrainians obviously do n't control the territory ... who does control it then ? 
  actually , given that they are obviously able to defend themselves and have powerful allies , you might want to reconsider that assessment . 
  well , if best korea ^ tm says so ... hope your guys have not flown home already . 
   nato wo n't ever show up . 
  and why should they ? 
  this is not an article-6-case . 
  ukraine is not a nato member state ( and for an obvious reason ) . 
   georgia during summer olympic games [ international observers almost unambigiously agree that georgia was clearly the aggressor in the russo-georgian war of 2008 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_for_the_russo-georgian_war )  ukrainian crimea during winter ones in fact , that happened * after * the sochi winter olympics . 
   the rest of the ukraine during the finals of the world cup ... 
  i find a large-scale ukrainian-crushing invasion within the next twelve hours very , very unlikely . 
   eu will do nothing , france will still sell russia the ships , half of the eu ( poland included ) will still buy russian gas and oil , germans will still want to have partnership with russia and nato will send harsh words and do nothing more . 
  aka `` the sane way of doing things '' : do n't piss off the russian bear about territory you have little interest in . 
  well , actually , russian troops went three kilometers inside the [ lugansk people 's republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lugansk_people's_republic ) , which may or may not have invited them . 
  yes , it might provoke kiev , but there are two parts of this medal . 
   can anyone know for certain what his business/family/country status will be in 5-10-15 years and that any decisions now wo n't be detrimental in the future ? 
  but i see what assets i have , how secure they likely are , how my government is spending ( hint : no new debts in 2015 for the first time in half a century ) , and then i decide if having a * small * family is a good idea . 
   and it 's not that he can get rid of his children . 
  oh , there are n't orphanages in greece ?
