   we 've been under occupation for 123 years because our neighbors decided so and international community had nothing against that . 
  yes ... because you have been unable to defend your territory from outside forces , not because we just did n't let you into the clubhouse . 
   why else would we say it 's a big deal that `` state x recognizes state 's y independence '' . 
  to perpetuate the myth that statehood in some way is linked to foreign approval . 
   if you buy a plot of land in germany and samehow make international community to recognize your plot of land as an independent state - you have an independent state and you 'll be treated as such . 
  i do n't necessarily need to * buy * the land . 
  i just need to successfully project force over it that 's larger than that of the state it originally came from . 
  if i can only legally pay with oompah-loompa money , the postal service only delivers letters only if willie wonka is featured on the stamps , if the policemen are green-haired and the army features sugar cones , if said army can defend the area i live in from it 's neighbors , if there is some kind of court system and a firm set of laws , then i 'm in the wonka state , even though berlin might consider it illegitimate and part of it 's territory and the un does n't take it seriously . 
  that 's pretty much the situation in transnistria , taiwan , and a whole shebang of other de-facto regimes . 
  does n't make them any less a state . 
  * 3rd separate spetsnaz regiment ( kirovograd ) * 8th separate spetsnaz regiment ( khmelnitskyi ) * 10th separate spetsnaz detachment ( kyiv ) * 50th special center ( kirovagrad ) * 801st anti-diversionary detachment ( mykolaiv ) * 73rd special naval center ( 73 mtssn ) ( ochakiv ) * `` omega '' ct unit ( within the ngu , stationed in kyiv ) pick one . 
  of course , that would make a cold war very , very hot , and kyiv knows a shooting war with russia would result in a larger russia and a no-longer-existing ukraine . 
  actually , the widely-accepted definition of terrorism is just `` trying to change policy by means of illegitimate force and terror '' . 
  remember , one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter , and had the word been around back in the time , the country whose flag you 're wearing would have been called `` a illegitimate terrorist takeover '' by the british . 
  i guess you are entitled to your ... imho kinda warped ... opinion of international law and affairs . 
   jellinek is nice , but the un does n't give a shit . 
  this is the official international definition . 
  given that the un is not some kind of international leviathan , the un 's opinion means shit . 
  if a group de facto controls a territory and keeps it running , it de facto is a state . 
   the donetzk republic fails at full-filling the last one . 
  how so ? 
  the donetzk republic very well is able to enter relations with other states . 
  just as northern-cyprus , south ossetia ( even recognized by a few un member states ) , abkhazia and all the others - even like kosovo or taiwan - do . 
  the moment a government ( or a group of people calling themselves a government ) can pick up a phone and dial the number of a consulate or foreign office anywhere , they have `` the ability to enter relations with other sovereign states '' - if the state which was called does n't answer that call , that 's not a problem of the de-facto-regime . 
   if only russia and a couple other non-recognized states recognize a state , it does not count as an official state and thus will be regarding as part of another state , in this case ukraine . 
  so , you now officially granted south-ossetia official-state-status ? 
  after all , they are recognized by at least nicaragua , venezuela , and a few other un-recognized states i do n't recall right now . 
  `` but those were bought by evil russia '' , you might protest . 
  well , so the eu bought belarus which was about to recognize south ossetia , but was given visa-free entry for some top officials to the schengen area for stopping the recognition process . 
  the rules you state are very open by necessity . 
  for instance , by your rules , if you do n't extend statehood to south ossetia , kosovo would n't be a state either ( it is n't recognized by all - or even a majority of un member states ) - nor would either of the roc/prc be . 
  in the end , the un seal of approval means shit . 
  in the end , what matters is whom you buy stamps and passports from , who cares for internal and external security , and who decides economic policy . 
  if ukraine ca n't do that in the donetzk republic - or crimea , or that other breakaway republic whose name i keep forgetting ( lugansk ? 
  ) , then de facto it is no longer part of their territory . 
  just came home and skimmed over the original paper . 
  recognition is not a requirement - even though the donetzk people 's republic has it . 
  or maybe it has become that much of a footnote , 
  technically , yes , an organized crime syndicate could very well be considered a state if their level of organization is big enough , e.g. 
  they de-facto are the force controlling a territory and it 's people . 
  i am suggesting russia helping pro-russian forces in east ukraine is the same thing as the eu helping pro-eu forces in west ukraine . 
   a self-proclaimed republic , a russian proxy recognizes another sefl-proclaimed republic ? 
  of course , this changes everything . 
  given that south ossetia itself is recognized by a few un countries , yes , it does . 
   this is what state sponsoring of terrorism is , by definition . 
  you may call it terrorism ... 
  i call it `` international relations '' . 
  it seems the ukraine has nothing against `` terrorism '' when it comes in monies from the eu to kiev ... 
   oh indeed !, 
  you guys are more about the netherlands , right ? 
  yeah , pretty much , [ even though the netherlands is n't much of a match either ] ( https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dfb.de%2findex.php%3fid%3d500000%26no_cache%3d1%26action%3dshowrivalbalance%26liga%3dnationalmannschaft%26gegner%3ddfbat6%26lang%3dd%26chash%3d99f2fab2e4212e39c206f75fa63b240c&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  but then , we kinda still hate how the dutch players were kinda unsportsmannish when they spit on our team in ' 90 . 
  for example , when ~ ~ we ~ ~ ... our sponsors forced them to sit in the stadions without pants in 2006 ( because those pants were brewery-sponsored ... ), 
   both self-proclaimed republics and their `` confederation '' is not recognized as a state by any other state/government , including un and even russia herself . 
  that 's irrelevant if you are a follower of ~ ~ jellniek ~ ~ jellinek 's `` law of three elements '' : if you have territory , a people and de-facto power over and within said territory and people , by definition , you are a sovereign state . 
  by the way , the people 's republic of donezk is recognized by south ossetia and heavily supported by russia . 
   could you please clarify a bit of an `` understanding of international law '' 1 . 
  state philosophy , e.g. 
  ~ ~ jellniek ~ ~ jellinek which i outlined above 2 . 
  united nations general assembly resolution 1514 ( xv ) recognizes the right of peoples to self-determination . 
  ... so does un charta article 1/2, 
   england has particular rivalries with germany a rivalry that 's not mutual , btw . 
  mostly because the english team has not been much of a threat for a long time , wembley ~ ~ ' 64 ~ ~ '66 obviously was a biased referee ( who - as a russian - answered `` stalingrad '' about why he decided the german goal was not a goal ) , and we got our revenge for than in south africa , when an obvious english goal against us was not given . 
  well , where exactly was she put into arrest ? 
  in ukraine , or an east-ukrainian de-facto regime ( which may or may not be considered a sovereign state depending on your understanding of international law ) , or in russia ? 
   otherwise someone could register company in european equivalent of somalia and de facto abuse its workforce . 
  oh pray , tell me where this wonderous eu somalia is located ?

  the fun part is that our counterintelligence originally caught this guy because they thought he works for the russians . 
  evil tounges say had they known the us was involved , they would just have given him a free pass . 
  yeah ... but how do you call a wage increase for people having done their industrial or trade `` meister '' title ? 
  a meister raise !, 
  thank you , thank you , i 'll be here all week . 
   the intention is to exclusively charge non-germans for this by offsetting the vignette for germans through our car taxes . 
  ... for now . 
  we all know that eventually - and eventually might be less than five years - the offset will shrink because of `` road building necessities and solidarity '' , and we all just will pay more . 
   how fast is landing plane going ? 
  according to my google-fu , average speed for boeing 747 is about 130-160 knots ( ~ 240-300 km/s km/h ) . 
  only the landing plane is not a 747 - it 's a 767-300 - which has an [ approach speed of 140 knots according to boeing ] ( http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/faqs/arcandapproachspeeds.pdf ) - or slightly less then 260 km/h . 
  [ vq-bsx is a 17-year-old plane , which makes it a senior citizen ] ( http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b767-27612.htm ) . 
  it flew for klm and air astana before it was given to utair in april . 
  it only has economy seats , 336 in all .

  ah , i see how you are mistaken . 
  this wo n't make the zoll any less uncomfortable - it 's for big business , not for small standard citizen . 
  we got a free trade agreement with switzerland - every third package i get from there gets sorted out by the zoll . 
  well , we 're already thinking about throwing their cia representative out of the country . 
  stuff like this at this point in time will not necessarily make us less likely to do so . 
  the osce disagrees . 
  so does nato . 
  even the eu blames * both * sides , not russia exclusively . 
   if they had n't fought back then , now we would have georgian ssr , but russia would be responsible . 
  and if the sky was n't blue ...  they tried the same trick with ukraine , but ukraine responded correctly , and thus was n't deemed as an aggressor . 
  after parading three tanks around and declaring them as russian , it looks a lot like an ukrainian-sponsored gleiwitz-style incident to me .
