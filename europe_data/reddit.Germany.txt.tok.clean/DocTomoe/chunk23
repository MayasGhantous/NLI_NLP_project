  mk 11.15-17 ; mt 21.12-3 ; lk 11.45-46 ) there are a few more examples ... 
  it 's better hidden , but it is there . 
  yeah , sure . 
  ever read their holy book recently ? 
  judeochristian religions are * anything * but meant to be peaceful . 
  ... unless they 're [ protestants ] ( https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=utf-8#q=catholic%20persecution%20of%20protestants&amp;safe=off ) . 
  or [ jews ] ( https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=utf-8#q=catholic%20persecution%20of%20jews&amp;safe=off ) . 
  or [ scientists ] ( https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=utf-8#q=catholic%20persecution%20of%20scientists&amp;safe=off ) . 
  or [ not well liked by the current pope , sometimes for petty reasons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_excommunicated_by_the_roman_catholic_church ) . 
  you do n't torch your house down to avoid fire . 
  that 's what happened in south africa . 
  so we have two things here : 1 . 
  a preexisting medical condition . 
  people sometimes die from epileptic seizures , regardless of where they live . 
  the inability of affording medicine - this might come as a surprise to op , but we have societal layers in germany who are very unable to pay for medicine , even if it is a life-saving one . 
  the inability of affording a funeral - a lot of people have that problem here . 
  around 22650 times in 2010 alone , tendency rising . 
  it is a horrible situation for the family in question , and they do have my sympathy . 
  what does not have my sympathy is making this a `` woe-is-us-greeks '' sob story decrying the unfairness of the greek system , especially in times where such an accussation impliies things are related to external factors . 
   l'alsace-lorraine was ours to begin with . 
  yeah , sure . 
  that territory changed hands every other decade . 
  keep enjoying it . 
   it 'll be a day of drinking and celebration . 
  stereotypes are that scotsmen do n't need a reason for that . 
  and it worked rather well ... 
  yeah , sure . 
  you do n't even understand simple vocabulary in bi - and multilateral agreements . 
  i 'd say you 've been either talking out of your ass and are a troll , or you should get to whoever sold you that course and ask for your money back . 
  as you are obviously unwilling to learn , i do n't see what good can come out of continuing this conversation . 
  have a nice day . 
   ( not even to the page ! ), 
  sometimes , ideas and concepts - and the arguments leading to said theories - ca n't be put in two succinct sentences . 
  sometimes , it needs a whole book . 
  the sane , informed reaction would be to do a minimum amount of work , get the book , and read it . 
  go read some kratochwil ( i suggest  kratochwil , friedrich : international law : acontemporary perspective ( boulder , colo. , westview press , 1985 ) co-edited with richard falk , princeton university and saul mendlvit , rutgers law school . 
  and then we talk further on this . 
  actually , i get most of my international news from the beep , which i consider to be rather too careful than too sensationalistic . 
  you have obviously little to no idea how legislation regarding to international treaties work , nor do you understand the difference between treaties , conventions , declarations or protocols . 
  in short , you are not qualified to talk about this stuff . 
  an `` international law '' would need an `` international leviathan '' to ensure it 's being upheld . 
  as no such international leviathan exists , there 's no such thing as an international law . 
  at best , an un treaty can - but does n't necessarily need to - be translated to national law , which in turn then might or might not be followed . 
  you are making the obvious mistake to limit the problem to the experiences you made by ( willfully ? ), 
  ignoring the very existing problems around you . 
  kreuzberg does exist , so does hasenbergl . 
  we have a massive problem with what our media has started calling `` s\u00fcdl\u00e4nder '' , to not call them `` turks '' . 
   english , french , italian , russian , azerbaijan , greek , ... 
  they all seem to be doing fine . 
  common european ancestry . 
  that very quickly turns around once you start looking at albanians or anatolians ( i 'm not considering every person of turkish descent to be a problem - it is just we got mostly poor , extremely-conservative rural dwellers ) . 
  you might be surprised , but african `` asylum seekers '' ( who more often than not are in reality `` wealth seekers '' ) do not share a common european heritage with us . 
   there was a huge influx of polish/silesian people in the 1880-ties and 1890-ties as well . 
  ... having common european heritage - even more so , often common prussian heritage . 
  they hardly had to integrate . 
   and sending those back who fail to make the effort . 
  careful there ... have n't you heard this makes you a nazi ? 
   current job means i 'm driving 90 km per day to and 90 km back from job ; my brothers moved even farther away )  the `` job deficit '' is very much a solvable problem , especially for people willing to work . 
  a way of life also means that you are based somewhere - it means you have friends and colleagues , that you might engage in local life . 
  you are sacrificing that for your job , but it 's not for everyone . 
  also , you say it yourself : you work in it . 
  that means you are highly-trained . 
  we lack jobs for those who did not have the skills to get into that kind of job . 
   everyone who 's willing to work and integrate into the society should be welcome yeah , because integration worked so well with the other groups that have come here in the last 60 years . 
  you are aware that we do have a job deficit , especially in the lower-tier area , and you are aware that asylum seekers are banned from working here for some time ? 
   yes , they ca n't do that because mexico is n't a war-torn devastated country . 
  mexico did n't just experience massive social upheaval in the last few decades . 
  erm , does the term `` zeta '' ring a bell with you ? 
  mexico is about as close to an anarchist/civil-war country as you can get without an actually hot war starting . 
   these people are absolutely destitute , have no money or resources of any kind and dumping them in a country like morocco is probably gon na end with them dying somehow i 've just last week seen a documentation about a refugee ... well , it 's best described as ` township ' in morocco , with people being ` parked ' there for months and years , waiting for their chance to cross . 
  it 's not like they 'd automatically die . 
  but in the long run , everyone dies . 
   it a ` int because they 'll be treated like angels , it 's because they get to live . 
  it is because they think they made it , and now their life in milk and honey country starts . 
  most of them are being sent back pretty quickly . 
  there is no such thing as `` un law '' . 
  the universal declaration of human rights ( udhr ) is just that : a declaration , and it 's being widely ignored completely or in parts by every single member state of the un - thus , it 's obviously not legally binding . 
  the 1951 convention and it 's 1967 protocol only define what a refugee is and what * is to be done by member states * , without describing any consequence if said things are not done - thus it is a feel-good gesture , but not a law . 
  technically , it was a tank . 
  though i prefer this [ oldie but goldie from our british friends ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nifdpfoy1fq&amp;feature=kp#t=0m20s ), 
  `` parking enforcement business '' - you just roll over cars that are parking wrongly , thus motivating the newcomers to do it right . 
  possible customers : * people whose rented parking plot always is filled by others * ex-spouses out for revenge * supermarkets wanting their parking plots for their customers , not for customers of other markets ... 
  i think you might want to have less beer before answering to posts that you might or might not have completely understood . 
  i 'm trying to dumb it down : to get your country together after years of decline , a common enemy and another superpower being dependant on your energy deliveries might be exactly the thing you want . 
  from time to time , tanks show up . 
  low-hanging would be the observation that this is the first time poland gets motor-driven vehicles from germany and has to pay for them . 
  ( we consider car theft mostly being done by polish citizens , with the intent to take it over the border . 
  `` come spend your vacation in poland - your car 's already there '' ), 
  a lot of our neighbors thought nazism actually was a good idea , and it was an even better idea to join what appeared to be the winning party at that point in time . 
  of course , once the war was over , those very same people vehemently denied ever ever having seen nazi soldiers or having exchanged any words with them . 
  rule of thumb : the louder they `` celebrated '' not having been nazis , the more likely they had tons of voluntary ss divisions . 
  i 'm not going to point fingers to our neighbors , but there are no innocents . 
  nato strategy was to use up to 300 nukes of different yield in the fulda gap within the first 24 hours after a soviet invasion scenario . 
  i guess it 's safe to assume that they did n't give much of a fuck about their comrades either . 
  seriously , i think you guys might have a problem . 
  one bike is fine . 
  two ... on hot days with much physical labor . 
  but more than two bikes is an addiction that needs professional help . 
  no more bikes for you until you can prove that you 've been in bike addiction treatment . 
  we might have some of them still standing around .
