  where do you want them ? 
  only our cars have that . 
   if russia simply offered to buy crimea back from ukraine , for , say , forgetting the ukrainian gas debt , would n't that be a more profitable deal for russia ? 
  it seems everybody would be happy . 
  you do n't understand . 
  you do n't buy back what you consider to be stolen . 
  buying back something stolen to forget about other debts is like being stolen from twice . 
   anyone remember how russia spent $ 50 billion on the olympics to impress the world and show how modern russia is ... actually , those were 50 billion to raise nationalist feelings with their own population ( remember the ~ 1000 kids singing their anthem at the closing ceremony ? ), 
  and i would argue that everything is going according to vladimir 's plan . 
  seriously , the cold war is the single best thing that could have happened to our societies . 
  it got us space access , computing power , increased manufacturing , and a billion things that help us with everyday life - all spoils of defense developments . 
  all that with an enemy we could respect , and which we knew was not as insane as to actually start a hot war . 
  who says closer russo-chinese relationship , weakened oligarchs at home , getting europe off their back , a stronger nato ( and thus a bogeyman to help raising defense spending and for rhetorics ) was n't exactly what putin wanted ? 
  chinese having a sweet deal with russia will make border disputes easier , and make the chinese more likely to cooperate in the security council ( and , for that matter , in pacific operations ) . 
  the west being forced to put more spending into defense will make a lot of small nations very nervous and more likely to buy russian defense systems ( think , e.g. 
  jordan , or the lebanon , or syria , or about three douzen central asian nations , who all have an interest in keeping `` independent '' ) . 
  putin is many things , but he is not an idiot . 
  every step he has taken since his ascension to the presidency in 2000 was carefully planned . 
  why does the nyt think he just went insane ? 
  yeah ... you might want to quote the * whole * sentence ...  *** according to press releases *** during the 2008 russian invasion of georgia polish-made grom rockets targeted russian planes and helicopters 20 times , 12 rockets were fired out of which 9 hit their targets . 
  [ 1 ] ( last edit on that article at time of writing this comment : may 25 ^ th ) so 1 . 
  press releases = propaganda 2 . 
  the `` russian invasion '' is only a russian invasion if you listen to georgia . 
  most sources agree that georgia was the obvious aggressor in this one [ sauce ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_for_the_russo-georgian_war ), 
  yes . 
  strength noone is able to provide . 
  we 're talking about russia here , not tuvalu . 
   we ( on average ) do n't like the lgbt people and we never even had a gay parade , which seems to be a pretty big deal in the western europe . 
  actually , noone gives a damn . 
  it 's just the internet , and then mostly reddit , which has an issue with that . 
  well , i certainly hope that the nato makes clear poland is on it 's own - you ca n't start alliances outside nato and expect us to help if that goes bad . 
  one out of three , with a target drone that does n't do much obvious evasive maneuvering . 
  seriously , you got ripped off . 
  ** edit : ** seven downvoters can not into space . 
  yay warmongering . 
  just put a gun in the hands of those who feel threatened instead of the more cool-headed ones , it all will work out . 
  noone took the eu parliament elections seriously because the eu parliament is as close to useless as it can get . 
  there 's no legislative power , no decisionmaking , no influence on everyday life . 
  the real politics happen in the kommission , and those guys are not elected ( and frankly , that the kommission president now is ` elected ' - which in fact he is n't , it 's more of a `` suggestion by the voters '' , does n't make it much better ) . 
  people will take the eu parliament seriously when there * is * something to be taken seriously . 
  up until then , it 's a clown show . 
  i guess we both know how i meant that ... 
  but then , still better than [ this guy ] ( http://www.maxhavelaar.be/sites/default/files/schulz_martin_official_portrait.jpg ), 
  just came back from voting . 
  given the alternatives , the only party mildly attractive was the eurocritical afd . 
  given what i saw , morning turnout is rather low ( i saw about 20 wahlbenachrichtigungen up to now ) , which is kind of an indicator what to expect . 
  i guess that the local elections , which happen simultaneously , will give the eu parliament election a bit of a boost , though . 
  in germany , depending on the election , an empty ballot can be understood as an endorsement of a certain political party ( this is mostly the case in local elections , though ) . 
  all other `` invalid '' votes are counted in the `` ung\u00fcltige stimmen '' category , which directly translates to `` people who are too stupid to follow easy instructions , thus to vote to begin with . '', 
  also , statistically , conservative voters vote early in the morning , while socialist/social-democratic voters vote later in the day . 
  as there 's a higher chance for rain in the afternoon , go figure . 
  they got infiltrated by a whole bunch of crazies , ranging from radical feminists to antifa antideutsche . 
  for instance , they do have someone on their list for the eu parliament who took part in a [ femen-style protest thanking the british bomber command general for his devastating attack on dresden in 1944 - while the rest of the city mourned their dead , which were mostly old people , women and children , a fact that was known to british bomber command * before * the attacks . ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/femen-aktion-in-dresden-zu-bomber-harris-sorgt-fuer-streit-a-954246.html ) . 
  ( link might be nsfw , above-waist nudity ) . 
  actually , the old , technological-oriented core went on strike against their own party leadership after that , shutting down their communication infrastructure . 
  they just were disorganized three years ago . 
  nowadays , their leadership is batshit insane , and their `` original members '' have mostly given up . 
  if that was n't about hitler , it would be a funny story . 
  he tried to become a german citizen ever since 1913 , mostly to avoid the austrian draft . 
  in 1925 , after his prison sentence , he officially declared himself `` staatenlos '' ( not sure how to translate this , he gave up citizenship from the austrian state ) , to avoid being deported there . 
  given that the austrians were not to keen to take him back , they happily agreed . 
  back in the day , you could work for the government to become naturalized if you were staatenlos . 
  nowadays , you first need to be a citizen - we do learn from our mistake . 
  his politically more successful friends then started a whole series of attempts to get him a naturalization , but after his putsch in munich , most of them failed . 
  when he had a chance , he sabotaged himself ( for instance , he was given a job as a police officer . 
  when he learned he would have to do actual work , he destroyed the document declaring him a german citizen ) . 
  eventually , he was planned to become - i kid you not - a professor for political science in braunschweig ( a city that was mostly social-democratic/communist at that point in time ) - a faculty specifically designed for hitler at the technische hochschule . 
  a fact , btw , that the university only got to know * after * the state ministry - led by a nazi sympathizer - fucked up and put it in the budget plan . 
  then , they tried him to become a mayor of a small town . 
  did n't work out either , mostly because the local parliament was against it . 
  finally , he got a pro forma job in a state ministry , and thus became a citizen in 1932 . 
  he worked there for two days ( ! ), 
  before he asked for a vacation to take part in the elections , and , after a little more than a year , he quit . 
  of course , after austria got `` heim ins reich '' in 1938 , and all austrians were automatically germans , that issue never came up again . 
  bundestag ( lower house ) and bundesrat ( upper house ) . 
  bundestag gets elected once every four years , half of the seats get assigned by a direct vote , the other half based on lists . 
  members are said to be `` responsible only to their conscience '' - and their conscience is the will to be put on the list again next year , so technically and with very few historical exceptions , they vote along party lines . 
  bundesrat are two members of the government of each bundesland . 
  this is where usually the magic happens and where real debate - and real drama can be seen . 
  it 's also the house that usually gets ignored by the public . 
  well , then leave . 
  it 's going to be the 1970s all over again , and nothing good ( but monty python ) came out of that decade . 
  by the way : you do understand that your non-eu trade is not that much more than your eu trade ? 
  yes , it is . 
  by the way , your own revenue & customs office says uk exports to the eu are [ at around 13 billion in march ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/euoverseastrade/pages/euots.aspx ) . 
  that 's ridiculously little . 
  most of your exports are mineral fuels ( ~ 2.5 billion ) , non-rail vehicles ( ~ 1.4 billion ) and nuclear reactors ( ~ 1.4 billion ) . 
  to say this the most friendly way , that 's not something with a long-term demand that only the uk can provide . 
  other players work on * those * markets . 
  not only that , but at the same time , you 're importing around 19 billion . 
  so technically , you only make about 6 billion in revenue for the whole of the eu per month . 
  so , what do you * import * ? 
  non-rail vehicles ( 3.5 billion ) , nuclear reactors ( 2.4 billion ) and electrical machinery ( 1.5 billion ) ... 
  it seems the uk ca n't even satisfy their own demand with domestic production . 
  frankly , in a `` eu decides to make an example of a seceeding uk '' scenario , you 'd be fucked . 
  all values up to here in gbp , relevant to march of 2014 . 
  13 out , 19 in . 
  now let 's compare that to germany , shall we ? 
  [ this is the document by the statistische bundesamt ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/publikationen/thematisch/aussenhandel/gesamtentwicklung/zusammenfassendeuebersichtenm2070100141034.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) about march 2014 , the part relevant for this comparison is chapter 2.1.1 for exports , and 2.1.2 for imports . 
  as you can clearly see , we have about 65 billion euros in exports , and 57 billion euros in imports .
