  if we translate the euros into pounds , we get the following : | country | uk | ger | | : ----------- | ------------ :| ------------ :| | exports | 13 | 53 | imports | 19 | 46 | deficit/surplus | -6 | +7 in short ... be careful what you wish for . 
   but the uk , when it leaves the eu , is going to keep trading with the eu . 
  it is implied that someone who leaves voluntarily would get hit by massive punitive import tariffs by the remaining eu countries . 
  that 's the main reason we 're still in . 
  so , given the uk is not exactly a producer of goods , it 's unlikely . 
  kudos for getting that guy 's nationality right . 
  i do n't feel that i can fully comprehend the message of that video without understanding swedish ^ 1 . 
  they are likely using an analogy . 
  as it stands , it could either make fun of hilarious believes of eurosceptics or call into question the percieved power of the eu . 
  [ 1 ] `` otros l\u00e4ndre politike '' ^ 2 is likely `` the policy of other nationstates '' . 
  that 's about it . 
  [ 2 ] phonetic approximation of how i think it 's pronounced . 
  npd ... maybe . 
  there are not `` the '' freie w\u00e4hler , it 's a fragmented little group , and as they do n't appear on all ballots ... 
  germany : the cdu - like always . 
  and still , as we do n't have an entry barrier anymore , the big winners will be the `` small '' parties , like the eurosceptical afd ( said to be able to reach 7-9 % , which is considered a catastrophe by mainstream media ) , the fdp ( dropped out of the bundestag in the last election ) , and maybe the piraten ( which should be happy if they got a percent after their major fuck-ups in the last years ) . 
   `` people are angry because we did not strike syria at one instance but guess what : today , 92 percent of all the chemical weapons in syria are out and being destroyed and the other eight percent will get out , '' that was a russian proposal , and they are being destroyed in the l\u00fcneburger heide , in germany . 
  so , the united states being the united states ? 
  what a shocker . 
  aka `` every political party , ever '', 
  so you know where you stand politically , and you do not wish to be represented ? 
  voting invalid is just showing you are too stupid to vote . 
  noone 's going to read your notice anyways . 
  * wipes a tear from his eye * thank you ... 
  i sometimes forget there * are * sane places on reddit . 
  i really did n't think about that one ... and still i think it 's ironic that they would drown after they spit on our soccer players in 1990 . 
  it 's ... beautiful . 
  no , really . 
  that 's what the seven kingdoms are told . 
  ah , come on . 
  we have * an obvious troll winning the eurovision * pointless ep elections coming up * potential future member states ( = serbia ) suffering from a natural catastrophe * the us trying to push through ttip you really expect us to care for what essentially is an everyday situation in the ukraine/russia ? 
  you 're on reddit , and have been for some time . 
  you should know that eventually , topics meander away from the original post . 
   either europe stands for the things that matters , like the rights of their citizens , or it is not worth . 
  in this subthread , the topic is your erroneous idea that gay rights is the `` thing that matters '' , and the most important issue the eu has to handle at this point in time . 
  indeed . 
  nothing else matters . 
  europe will survive with gay rights as they are today . 
  europe - and particularily spain - will * not * survive if we keep having the employment problems we have today . 
  you claiming that gay rights `` matter '' is denying more important issues . 
  seriously , the eu has way bigger problems than gay rights . 
  they might matter , but they do matter way less than - for example - employment . 
   maybe she did not expect it to become violent ? 
  then she either lived under a stone - those protests * always * become violent - or she 's mentally challenged . 
  it 's an intermediate version of what eventually will become a centralist country run by one of the big three : uk , france , or , most likely , germany , much like classical china . 
  in many ways , it already is . 
  you 're on reddit ... the ukraine does n't matter anymore : putin just fuelled spacefaring . 
   country , not the benefit of the immigrants ...  ... like everywhere else in the world yeah , right . 
  yeah , destroy the innovative and competetive companies that give people what they want . 
  support siemens and the likes instead , who do a great job producing junk . 
  changed my view , have a delta : \u0394 then , of course , binge-drinking on coffee does n't cause traffic accidents . 
   you ca n't play bluff with nuclear missiles you moron . 
  mankind has been doing so since ' 45 , and it worked out great - and they bluffed against people way less sane than putin . 
   excuse me if i ignore some random american who only says things about a different country because that 's what his country is like . 
  i 'm not american . 
   besides , you think putin will see a trident nuclear.missile flying towards his lunch and say `` drat , foiled again '' or do you think he will say `` bring me the nuclear suitcase '' ? 
  `` targeted '' , not `` launched '' . 
   it 's not `` the '' ukraine . 
  [ we 've had that discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25679w/some_fresh_russian_literature/chefia9 ) . 
  in short : it depends on your cultural background . 
  actually , mad saved our asses for half a century , so technically , it 's the most awesome thing ever . 
  in your scenario , obviously the strike was n't thorough enough . 
   ok , so vaporizing 100 millions civilians does n't bug you , fine . 
  and it 's not `` slow annihilation or quick one '' , that 's utterly stupid . 
  no matter how brutal conventional wars are , entire nations are never destroyed by them . 
  100 million die quickly , or 80 million die slowly after being raped , shot at , run over by military hardware , summarily executed or put into labor camps . 
  how do you quantify human suffering ? 
  why do you think the survival of a nation state is more important than minimizing the suffering of it 's population ? 
   i 'm saying it will take you years , a decade at least . 
  a decade ? 
  ha ... you are aware we do have delivery systems already ready ? 
  this might not be known in cozy france , but we were ready to become a nuclear battlefield on a second 's notice in the later 20 ^ th century . 
  the idea was the us would let us participate in their arsenal - but i guess we did n't believe that either . 
  it would not surprise me if we had some quasi-assembled bomb casings somewhere with the physics package missing . 
   what the fuck are you on about ? 
  i am pointing out that conventional warfare is irrelevant , and nato 's full of shit . 
  the only thing that will prevent russia from invading * any * of us is the fear of getting a bad blow themselves , something conventional warfare just does n't offer . 
  thus , we all need to have first - and second-strike capability - not to use it , but to show we 're willing to use it . 
  the fail-deadly system is just so some soft-washed westerner does n't decide it `` is n't really necessary '' - because once one of them does so , the threat scenario is gone and everyone elses nukes are worthless . 
  and should we have to use them ... then better make sure the least amount of human suffering will come from it . 
  which of course means going for the 100 % annihilation rate . 
  who was talking about ww1 - a conflict that was heavily mismanaged by the russian side , and which they eventually just gave up on to help survive their internal struggles ( brest-litowsk was not exactly a defeat ) you might be surprised , but the majority of the people who died in napoleon 's russia campaign were what we would later consider to be `` germans '' . 
   well if the annihilation of humanity is a desirable end for you ... well , if it 's going to be war with russia , it 's either slow annihilation by conventional warfare , or quick one . 
  i prefer the quick route ... ... and it is not i who calls for war . 
  that 's nato . 
   you know that one nuke would n't do shit , right ? 
  you would need hundreds of them , long range missiles and pilots capable do carry them , heavy infrastructure to launch them . 
  and you think germany , out of all the countries , is n't capable of finding a way ? 
   besides you do n't seem to realise that germany would cease to exist if you do that , while russia , by its sheer size would survive and give you the finger . 
  you seem to think that survival is the win scenario here . 
   eu has 500mil . 
  * [ age distribution eu ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=age+distribution+eu ) and [ russia ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=age+distribution+russia )  plus eu surpasses in production many times . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  war is about destruction and will to destruction , not about production . 
   there are nukes in eu too you know . 
  they 're only 1 . 
  [ too few ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=nuclear+arsenal+gb+vs+france+vs+russia ) 2 . in the wrong hands and 3 . meant for the wrong people . 
   it worked so well in dr. strangelove ... actually , yes , it worked exactly like designed . 
  it would also force people to not put insane guys into positions of power . 
   besides , you do n't even have nuclear weapons [ . . ] so it 's out of question for you .
