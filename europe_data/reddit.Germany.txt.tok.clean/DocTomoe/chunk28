   call russia 's bluff and make putin back down , which would shatter his diplomatic might playing russian roulette with ss-18s . 
  sounds like a good idea . 
   but look at how wwii started and how it could have been prevented , had heads of states not tolerated nazi germany annexation/expansion nazi germany did not control wmds with global-twenty-minute-to-target delivery systems . 
   this is unthinkable , way too close to russian cities and most populated areas . 
  or are you implying russia would try to nuke european countries or the usa ? 
  a nuclear conflict would pretty quickly devolve in an international exchange of megatons . 
  in such a scenario , the first strike option is the preferrable one , because it gives you some time to prepare . 
   why would russia risk annihilation over crimea ? 
  why would the west ? 
  neither the ukraine nor the crimea is worth it . 
  that 's an awfully lot of `` should '' . 
  there 's no agreement , only a `` declaration of will '' - which costs nothing and still implies that do work on some level . 
  the moment they do , the ukrainian energy minister will suddenly morph into a glowing beacon of morality and an an example of the fascist and corrupt russian system persecuting innocent honest people for political reasons . 
  aka . 
  `` human nature '' . 
  take a public office , and within a year , you too will have your stack of secret bank accounts , investments and nonmonetary perks . 
  i gurantee it . 
  you guys all need to read and understand the treaty . 
  there is no automatism , and what france and the usa are doing has nothing to do with nato . 
   they had already soldier on place undermanned and underfunded . 
   but it has many cities all with a population which likes the `` opposing forces ''  and is nearly an island i do n't see how you think that 's relevant . 
  please elaborate . 
   they deployed quite a great deal of influence by mean of media and spontaneous pro russian groups . 
  aka . 
  psychological warfare , winning the hearts and minds ... 
  it 's military strategy 101 . 
   draft the basis of an european defense policy . 
  `` we 'll give some fighters to poland '' is not an european defense policy . 
  european defence policies do exist and have been `` successful '' . 
  we call them frontex . 
   withouth defense and intelligence , many countries might be vulnerables to similar well crafted take-overs . 
  i agree . 
  of course , there 's also the pact thing which makes most of the eu pretty much a no-go area for the red army . 
  was . 
  past tense . 
  in fact , russia is - despite it often is depicted like that - not run by madmen . 
  the crimea is an easy , soft target with a clear geostrategic relevance . 
  poland is n't . 
  neither are the baltics . 
  actually , i guess russia does n't give a shit . 
  spheres of interest yadda yadda . 
  thankfully , * some * of us have learned the lessons of the last century . 
  yeah , let 's pour some more oil into the fire . 
  it 's almost like certain nato countries * want * russia or poland to do something stupid and start ww3 . 
  actually , it 's my bank account 's choice . 
  i ran the numbers , and living nearer to my place of employment would be more expensive ( by the factor of 1.5 to 2 ) than owning and operating a car . 
  i also like having some food on the table from time to time . 
  do n't even mention the fact that moving for a job ( and giving up all the social contacts you have built over the years ) is not exactly a healthy thing to do . 
  i do n't vote because every vote i make takes money out of the tax fund and puts it into some party 's budget , which i disagree with on a moral basis . 
  it 's called `` parteienfinanzierung '' . 
  bah , what did the environment ever do for * me * ? 
  well , i do n't feel like i want to get up at 4am in the morning to get to my job by 8am sweaty and with crampy legs . 
  i also would like to have some free time before i fall asleep . 
   kosovo and south sudan - legal . 
  i might have missed the memo , but when did the un general assembly vote on the legality of the kosovan independence ? 
  `` and for the status of crimea *** as part of ukraine *** '' ... as you might have overread that . 
  now , i 'm not exactly a constitutional scholar when it comes to the republic of the crimea , but that 's the one which has this little sentence in it that the crimea is part of the ukraine . 
  well , it applies to most of the eu , so ... 
   except in this case it is n't democracy , who is to say that voting was not rigged ? 
  well , fuck-di-doodle-do : * every * voting is rigged , * especially * in european nations , either by making the possible answers difficult to understand , by having arbitrary limits on how many people have to vote and what percentages a party needs to get , by limiting the number of contenders or a whole bouquet or other methods . 
   you for the restoration of the constitution of the republic of crimea in 1992 and for the status of the crimea as part of ukraine ? 
  sounds like `` i want to stay ukrainian '' for me . 
  sounds like an either/or question . 
   are you a model ? 
  why do you need to wear makeup and style your hair for work ? 
  getting to work by bike requires effort and there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  fuck you if you think i should turn up without a misplaced hair . 
  at some places and in some jobs , coming to work looking like a gorilla just beat you up and stinking is not an option . 
  anything which puts you in front of a customer is such a job . 
   your loss . 
  cyclists are healthier , happier , and better for the environment and the economy  well , some of us dislike sit next to sweaty people who just biked into work for eight hours of every day of our lives . 
  tell me about your plan to flatten my neighborhood . 
  i think i would like a perfectly flat environment . 
  just for reference ... how long was your name on the waiting list for a studentenwerk room ? 
  back in my days , it was six semesters ... 
  which is great if your alma mater is in heidelberg , but horrible if it 's in munich . 
  on my first year of university in munich , i would have * killed * to have a room like that in the city ( and not the 2 hour each way commute i had ) . 
  eventually paid 360 euros per month for a room that was not * that * much better , without food coupons . 
  that was ten years ago . 
  luckily , natural selection eventually weeds them out . 
  * sigh * it 's a direct link to the relevant part . 
   it has been shown that *** it is possible to monitor computers from a distance *** , with only commercially available equipment , *** by detecting the radiation emitted by the crt monitor *** . 
  this form of computer surveillance , known as tempest , involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters . 
    ibm researchers have also found that , for most computer keyboards , *** each key emits a slightly different noise when pressed . 
  the differences are individually identifiable *** under some conditions , and so it 's possible to log key strokes without actually requiring logging software to run on the associated computer . 
    and it has also been shown , by adi shamir et al. , that *** even the high frequency noise emitted by a cpu includes information about the instructions being executed *** . 
  essentially : once you got a audio bug in the room , you 're screwed . 
  once your electrical grid is accessible ( within some perimeter ) , you 're screwed . 
   i 'd like an apology from everyone that used the argument ` the cold war is over ' in regards to gchq in the past 6 months . 
  only that the gchq spied on allies , not russia . 
  unless , of course , you do believe ww2 has n't ended , either . 
   only russian people can remove putin . 
  yeah , but why would they ? 
  the putin years are a lot better to russians economically than the pre-putin years were . 
  people vote for the betterment of their wallets . 
   if a nato ally so much as spots such a vehicle on the move they are on the move , constantly , and have been since the 1960s . 
  that 's part of the strategy . 
  you only know where they are for sure once you see the missile on the radar . 
  [ no network and regular wipes wo n't save you ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer_and_network_surveillance#monitoring_from_a_distance ) . 
  i guess it will depend on how you acted before .
