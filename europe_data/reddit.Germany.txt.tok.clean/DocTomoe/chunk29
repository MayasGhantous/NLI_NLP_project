  hint : poland provoking the bear will not make us want to risk getting collectively murdered . 
   paczki interestingly enough , those are almost exactly what we call berliner ( northern germany ) or krapfen ( southern germany ) . 
  we 've only recently annexed an second/third-world area in the east . 
  twenty years of economic stangnation was the result . 
  i do n't think we will repeat that error anytime soon . 
   unless article 5 is invoked re-read the article . 
  it just says that if one member state is being attacked ( within certain geographic areas ) , other member states * should * take '' * such action as it deems necessary * '' . 
  which could be laughing while poland gets slaughtered . 
  it 's not an suicide pact . 
  though they 're going to pay the iron price , not the gold price . 
  [ oh , you know , google news ] ( https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=china+on+ukraine&amp;oq=china+on+ukraine&amp;gs_l=news-cc.3..43j43i53.1519.4904.0.5264.18.9.0.9.0.0.312.756.7j0j1j1.9.0...0.0...1ac.1.q5tx37miuii ), 
  ww2 was `` doing too much , too late '' . 
  and we 're again at that point : it 's too late to have a non-catastrophic impact . 
  so all we can achieve is a catastrophic one . 
  and frankly , in that case , doing nothing is * exactly * the right decision . 
   there has to be diplomatic and military deterrent in place . 
  no one says that we have to send tanks to fight them , but we should send these tanks to show off that we are there if need be as a deterrent . 
  read up on the history of ww1 . 
  it 's only been 100 years . 
  well , if you want to fight the russians , go ahead . 
  just do n't drag everyone else into a conflict everyone just will lose . 
  they wo n't just lose an all-out war and ignore the capabilities they have - and the larger the conflict becomes , the more likely nuclear options will get . 
  postapocalyptica is cool in fallout 3 ... 
  it 's probably not so cool in reality . 
  * [ china agrees with russia over ukraine situation ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/03/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-china-idusbrea220ge20140303 ) * [ china is pursuing a gas deal with russia ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702303945704579390173038353200 ) china 's interest clearly is to have a happy russia . 
  my prognosis is this : we will see the crimea becoming another de-facto regime , like abkhazia , berg-karabach or transnistria . 
   why are so many people talking about russia like it is some kind of global super power . 
  it 's economy is smaller than that of italy . 
  ** the only reason they are able to do this is because of nukes ** and we ( nato ) have those as well . 
  i highlighted the answer you gave yourself . 
  as china already is siding with russia ... no need to tremble . 
  markets will realign . 
  meanwhile , poland ( and much of the eu ) is dependant on russian energy . 
   not with weapons , but with economical sanctions . 
  i am sure russia already is trembling in fear ... 
  yepp , pissing off denmark will make picking up eu negotiations so much easier / s, 
   yeah , but leopold was , you know , living there the equivalent would be an adolf-hitler statue in berlin . 
  i would think the vote was not a secret one - and that everyone in that parliament wonders when the reign of terror ^ tm sets in - would n't surprise me to be quick and bloody given how the last few days went . 
  `` i voted to impeach the president '' might be the one sentence that would spare someone their noose . 
  the plot thickens ... , 
  oh , he 's referring to that * other * part in belgium . 
  as neither romania , bulgaria nor croatia are not contracting parties in the 2002 treaty , they do not need to ratify . 
  in fact , once a treaty is ratified , it does n't automatically get un-ratified the moment one of the contracting parties gets enlarged . 
  this merely is an old and likely faulty database entry - or the contract would not be in effect ( see article 25 paragraph 1 ), 
   following rejection of the eea agreement in a referendum , the only way of mitigating the impact of the no vote involves the conclusion of bilateral agreements . 
  `` we shit on the democratically-expressed will of the peoples involved in a referendum and do it anyway '' . 
  it seems to be a common theme when it comes to the eu . 
   ratification status not   last update : 11/08/2009 i will refrain from invoking another of those `` eu efficiency '' arguments , but that 's rather pathetic . 
   people 's livelihoods are just as much at stake when their job is jeopardised because their employer ca n't compete with swiss products and services they are - but by far not as much as if the swiss economy would have an endless supply of cheap labor . 
  i am generally against labor competing , because it always competes with the local workers - thus diminishing standards of living for everyone . 
  see : wage development in germany 1990-2014 compared to wage development in the rest of the eu during that timeframe . 
  it is more than understandable that a people would not agree to that kind of attacks on their livelyhoods . 
  if we are fighting economic wars , we should at least fight them on something more abstract than people 's lives - capital , products and services work nicely . 
  go to switzerland and indulge then . 
  you have no idea what you are missing . 
  you have never dealt with siemens , it seems . 
  everything siemens does is produced more cheaply by chinese knock-off companies . 
  how comes siemens is still in business ? 
  just because you finished econ 101 does n't mean the models you have been taught are true in all instances . 
   if functionality is what you care about , a 30 $ casio does the job just as well . 
  and this is what we differ on . 
  also , [ ~ ~ 30 $ ~ ~ cheapish casio watches might get you in trouble at airports and lead to involuntary vacations in the carribean ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casio_f-91w#claimed_use_in_terrorism ) . 
  the british and the danish refuse to join the euro - even though they are obliged by eu law to introduce it . 
  how about we start cleaning in front of our own house before we alienate the only true democratic country in europe ? 
  i am for separating treaties that have * nothing * to do with each other . 
  the swiss do n't want free movement of people ? 
  fine - of course that also applies to swiss citizens within the eu . 
  does n't have a thing to do with air traffic ... 
  if you say so ... 
  ever tried swiss chocolate ? 
  i would wager if you had , you would n't write that kind of talk . 
   the eu has to look out for her citizens interests i agree . 
  after twenty years , they really should get started . 
  ... would n't touch them with a stick , really . 
  there 's a difference between `` expensive because of functionality '' and `` expensive because we can '' . 
  if those were available - or desireable . 
  in fact , someone who wants a swiss watch will not accept a cheap non-swiss knock-off - or all of us would walk around with chinese ones . 
  someone who uses abb for their production automation in a 30-million-euro-factory will not scrap the factory and rebuild with the incompatible siemens system . 
  it has n't done that in decades , so why start now ? 
  now , think quickly ... how does this affect an eu importer ? 
  if my customer wants a victorinox knive , an omega watch or some part for it 's process automation from abb , they will still buy it . 
  it will raise prices for tariffs , sure - but that would be seen as a moneygrab by brussles , thus making them even less popular with the eu population . 
  explain to me again how air traffic corridors or standardization of goods is relevant to settlement ? 
  [ actually , yes , some contracts are immoral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_merchant_of_venice ), 
  i would hope you give the eu a big middle finger and roll your own . 
  and you would find such behavior morally ok ? 
  from wikipedia :  these negotiations resulted in a total of ten treaties , negotiated in two phases , the sum of which makes a large share of eu law applicable to switzerland . 
  the treaties are :  first treaty   1 . 
  free movement of people  2 . 
  air traffic  3 . 
  road traffic  4 . 
  agriculture  5 . 
  technical trade barriers  6 . 
  public procurement  7 . 
  science   later treaties   8 . 
  security and asylum/schengen membership  9 . 
  cooperation in fraud pursuits  10 . 
  final stipulations in open questions about agriculture , environment , media , education , care of the elderly , statistics and services . 
  obviously , the one of `` free movement f people '' is affected , and likely `` security and asylum/schengen membership '' . 
  the treaties about air traffic or agriculture or standardization are not affected by the vote .
