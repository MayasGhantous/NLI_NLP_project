  renegotiating them is retalitatory . 
  the piece of legislation that makes this possible is the so-called * guillotine clause * - and it got that name for a reason . 
  taking your house is in the same contract as the mortage . 
  what happens here is more like you deciding not to extend your line of credit ( because you do n't need it ) , and the bank trashes your credit , freezes your account , conviniently forgets about that savings account you have and takes your house . 
  they are about to break * one * treaty . 
  this article talks about *** all *** treaties . 
  this is retaliatory and not very mature of the eu . 
  just like a little kid . 
  `` wahaaa , you do n't like to play house , let 's discuss about taking away every little thing from you . '', 
  actually , this will only strenghten the swiss position . 
  i 'm sure the decision was made in that * other * part of belgium , right ? 
  actually , in german , one of the synonyms for laissez-faire capitalism is `` manchester-kapitalismus '' . 
  funny thing is , after having read a bit about caligula ... 
  i could see how he might have ordered something like that . 
  so ... you claim sexual orientation is a genetic thing ? 
  do you have any studies that point to a `` gay gene '' ? 
  ( seriously , i 'm interested . ), 
  *** edit : *** thank you , that was interesting , even though up to now , all we have is hints , not proof . 
  i am aware of p4311 , and you are right , i used a term in the legal definition used in europe instead of the one issued in the states . 
  i am also an opponent to any right to pardon anyone , regardless of the definition , for the simple fact that a pardon ( or an abolition ) * always * is a violation of separations of power . 
  it is - regardless of who it is that gets the pardon - an act of despotism . 
  i am in no way an us constitutional scholar , but technically , what ford did was not a pardon , but an ` abolition ' ( need to find the matching us legal term ) . 
  a pardon is taking away the punishment of a convicted person , the abolition is stoping the legal process that might lead to one person being convicted . 
  also , see [ burdick v. united states ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burdick_v._united_states ) . 
  once you issue a pardon , and the pardon has been accepted by the one it is directed at ( a pardon ca n't be `` forced '' upon someone being guilty ) , there is a presumption of guilt , and for the pardonned it is like an admission . 
  a pardon shortcuts the judicial process . 
   where 's his ( = snowden ) pardon ? 
  you ca n't pardon someone who has not been tried and found guilty . 
  and snowden does avoid being tried pretty efficiently . 
  you are aware that when it is cold and moist enough for ice , chances are either there 's snow/ice on the solar panels , or the sun does n't shine ? 
  or that is what we are made to believe ... 
  well , great . 
  for some reason i do n't seem to remember the vote in west germany if we wanted them to join us ... well that 's maybe because there was n't one , and for good reason : we would have widely denied it . 
  there was another way , one that would have caused less ripples in the standard of living of both sides : gradual equalization in two states and eventual reunification . 
  of course , kohl would n't have won the 1990 elections without the votes of the east , so rapid and uncontrolled reunification it was - with massive loss of jobs on both sides . 
   the star wars scene where palpatine announces that `` the republic will be reorganized into the first galactic empire '' with a faux german accent , and natalie portman 's part ( `` this is how liberty dies '' ) as prominent polish anti-eu polititians . 
  how nice that we do n't actually make huge engineering mistakes like leaving a heat exhaust pipe open for terrorists shooting torpedos in . 
   excuse me , we have voted and accepted that framework , lucky you . 
  us germans were not so lucky - our leaders decided on the introduction of the euro north-korea-style . 
   his daughter with cher was chastity bono who the * fuck * would call a child `` chastity '' ? 
  as a reminder to use condoms the next time ? 
   i really , really disliked kohl , but the kohl/mitterrand generation would have handled the crisis so much better than this one . 
  well , kohl rushed into essentially annexing a bankrupt state in a - successful - attempt to get another re-election , so there 's that . 
  we 're going to pay for that mistake for decades after his death . 
  may he have a long life suffering his dementia . 
  this is not about compassion . 
  this is about survival . 
  this is not about making people miserable , either , but i simply do n't see why germans do n't see wage increases ( and have n't seen them in decades ) to not rock the boat , and everyone else around us demanding 20 % more each year . 
  i am sick and tired of being held responsible for someone else 's irresponsibility . 
  how about everyone starts building their wealth not on the bank accounts of their states , but on their own accomplishments . 
  by the way , there is little correlation between money and happiness . 
  1923 was bad , and for germany , it was not over in 1929 . 
  mass unemployment persisted well into the 1930s and were one for the major reasons for the rise of the nsdap . 
  you therefore are right : i do n't care about other countries mass unemployment , as long as it is a healthy shrinking process . 
  every country by definition can only support as many jobs as it 's productivity is worth . 
  there is no right to work ( but people are always able to either raise productivity or make the state stop throwing stones into the way of people starting their own business ) . 
  if you think i am a believer in a false dichotomy , you believe there 's a third option which does n't include magic at some relevant point . 
  please share that one with us . 
  i believe the euro to have been a horrible idea from the very start ( and have thought so since the early 1990s when the idea first became relevant ) for reasons which happened to prove themselves true in the last few years . 
  i would rather see the euro go bust than not - for everyone living and earning their living in the euro zone , it would be a massive win to go back to national currencies . 
  until that day , thought , we need to keep the euro as stable as possible to not make savers , and those mostly are `` small people '' suffer for mistakes they had no saying in . 
  we have n't even begun to start using force on you guys . 
  there are no sanctions against you , there is no embargo , we have n't frozen your offshore assets . 
  stop making * us * look like the irresponsible ones . 
  that 's the guy who did n't see the us housing bubble and who claimed the internet was a fad that would collapse by 2005 because `` no one really has something to say to anyone '' . 
  ~ ~ kurgan ~ ~ krugman ( damn autocorrect ) is not exactly a credible source . 
   do we want the greek to suffer for the mistakes their previous governments made ? 
  suffering is healthy . 
  we had one hyperinflation in 1923 . 
  we do n't need another one , thank you very much . 
   no , the only thing we really care about is that greece balances its budget so the euro itself does n't drift into dangerous territory . 
  what happens to 11 million greeks is of secondary importance . 
  so instead of 11 million greeks , 250 million eurozone citizens should suffer , for the mistakes of the greek government . 
  how that is any better you will have to explain to me . 
   carrier groups are utterly useless in modern warfare , good for taking out a bunch of cavemen in durka-durkastan but in real war carriers will last all but 30 seconds when 35 yakhont anti-ship missiles start their trajectory towards them . 
  that implies you have 35 p800 anti-ship missiles , which i doubt . 
  currently , even the russians only have two swimming units carrying this weapon system . 
  the syrians at one point had 72 rockets - which means at most they can take out 2 carriers ( if the system works as promised ) . 
  the us has a few more than just two carriers . 
   greece is the most militarized country in the western world next to usa [ actually , that would be israel , then cyprus , * then * greece ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_global_militarization_index ) ( the us itself is on place 31 ) . 
  by the way , how do you tell your senior citizens to take another cut in their pensions while paying for another oversized mastrubation device ? 
  interestingly , most germans i am in contact with do admire the italians for their way of life and their ability to be laid-back and at the same time ardent about things . 
   100 russian battle-ships are you going to give some to them ? 
  the black sea fleet currently has 43 swimming units ( `` battleships '' , but really , those also include transport ships ) in varying states of disrepair and activity . 
   greece is the most strategically important place on planet earth as far as the near-future is concerned actually , that would be the east china sea and the gulf of aden , depending on your geopolitical goals . 
   russia would love nothing more than to unite with greece and get a few navy bases in greece , i am sure your allies , the americans , will have a word with you about that . 
  a word supported by a few carrier groups . 
   our military strength for the defense of our nation is un-beatable by any foreign power on earth . 
  keep believing that . 
   greece is anything but economically destroyed , its not 2008 anymore want to take a guess why that is so ? 
  hint : it has something to do with stopping to spend like a drunk sailor . 
   and greece is building itself up to be the next norway with trillions in oil/gas reserve money yeah , sure . 
   to provide funding for high-tech greek research projects . 
  sure . 
  it is interesting to see this happening , though i fear it 's more a pipe dream and an easy way to syphon money out of the state . 
   eu needs us far far greater than we need them , best to never forget that . 
  hahahahahahahaha ... are you serious ? 
  racist !, 
  what you conviniently forget to mention is how all these costs were inflated like a balloon after they joined the eurozone and getting cheap rates , with no real intention of ever paying back - and back then , it * was * for getting re-elected .
