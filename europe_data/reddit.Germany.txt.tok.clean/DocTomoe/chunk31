  well , there is that tale that mafia actually stands for * morte alla francia , italia anela * ( `` the death of france is desired by italia '' , excuse my bad italian ) ... 
  you tend to dislike the bank manager who decides to freeze your overdrawn account . 
  that would pretty much boil down to / r/shitcsumemberssay - most bavarians are actually sane . 
  source : i lived with them , jane-goodall-style , for some years . 
  we do . 
  it 's just that your idea of ` good ' is n't necessarily identical with our idea of ` good ' . 
  trust / u/quebe . 
  you would n't like us when we go to scary mode . 
  well , somehow he has to make it to all those kids houses in such small time . 
  russia is a * big * country, 
  just look at all that target practice ... ( wish i could change my flag to `` chinese '' for this comment only ), 
  hm , has the \u00d6bb any assets that can be taken in the us ? 
  note , though , that these seem to be dumping sites , not sites of nuclear reactor failures . 
   there are plenty of lakes around russia that do n't freeze at the winters now , even though nothing new is poured in them . 
  that 's pretty cool , actually . 
  a lot more contries use russian designs - it 's not just russia and the ukraine . 
  the list also does n't take mobile reactors into consideration . 
  overall , i would guess the number kind of evens itself out , with maybe 20 % more western designs in operation . 
  let 's see . 
  i see * violation of the vermummungsverbot * obvious attacks against the police with pyrotechnics and stones * destruction of property ... and even then the police allowed the protestors to leave peacefully . 
  ( 3:10 ) seriously , these vandals should be happy they did n't get all rounded up and sent to holding cells . 
  given that the russian-designed reactors up to now have one catastrophic failure while western-designed reactors up to now have four catastrophic failures , i would say : good for the finnish . 
  do n't worry . 
  by now , they will even think we 've been in the center of europe forever instead of relocating to east asia about sixty years ago . 
  [ tell that to the people of duisburg ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=duisburg+roma+house&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=mvc3ustgcoszhaft2odybw&amp;ved=0cfgqsaq&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=639 ) . 
  this area has essentially become a no-go zone for locals . 
  of course , they do n't exactly `` work '' , so the headline holds true . 
  while such a statistic may or may not be true , it does n't work well with the common voters who use a more `` common sense '' approach . 
  actually , it 's not about the benefit system primarily . 
  it 's about the labor market . 
  why would i employ someone from my home country for low-level work if a tadzbekistani immigrant does it for a fraction of what the local worker asks for ? 
  actually , not really . 
  first , you need to understand that austria-hungary did consider themselves in the defense - they worked under the assumption that their heir to the throne had been killed by serbian and/or russian operatives . 
  the fact that serbia refused to allow austrian investigations in sarajevo only increased such ideas . 
  in short : a strike against serbia was an act of * defense * , not one of aggression . 
  insofar , austria and poland were in a similar situation ( while , of course , for the polish in 1939 , the situation was a lot less ambigious ) , the so-called `` blankoscheck '' we gave the austrians was essentially a note that read the following ( sorry for my strange translation , ancient german is a bitch to translate ) :  \u201e kaiser franz joseph can be assured that his majesty [ = wilhelm ii ] , in accord [ ... ] with their old friendship , stand faithfully by the side of austria-hungary . `` note that this is n't even a promise of military action . 
  this is a reassurance that we are with them , not more . 
  if such a military conflict even was considered when this blankoscheck was written is a matter of constant debate . 
  of course , the austrians believed this was a go-forward to declaring war . 
  might be , but not because of the malt . 
  likely ipa has other non-allowed ingredients . 
   this is bullshit , al qaeda ( btw , is this the official notation ? ), 
  wikipedia :  al-qaeda ( / \u00e6l\u02c8ka\u026ad\u0259 / al-ky-d\u0259 ; arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 al-q\u0101\u02bfidah , arabic : [ \u00e6lq\u0251\u02d0\u0295\u026ad\u0250 ] , translation : `` the base '' and alternatively spelled al-qaida and sometimes al-qa ` ida ) see also : http://xkcd.com/927/, 
  actually , malt is explicitly allowed ( it comes in through the barley ) . 
  so , why does everyone get pissy when we invade belgium and the netherlands ? 
  according to that logic , it 's like sitting on your front porch :p, 
   german political leaders a hundred years ago did . 
  that war did n't start with austria-hungary attacking serbia ; it started with germany giving the blank cheque to austria-hungary - which was 22 days before austria-hungary declared war to serbia . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  it 's like saying britain started world war 2 by giving the polish gurantees against nazi germany . 
   austria-hungary did n't had the guts to go to war without having the coverage of germany . 
  actually , i would not be so certain about it . 
  it was a fucked up time . 
   the allies declared germany as the starter of the war because that was the easiest way to weaken them significantly . 
  * vae victis * - and in this case , also the victors . 
  by declaring us the aggressors unjustly , with unintended consequences , the victors prepared a fertile ground on which something really dark grew . 
  we tried . 
  i think it is save to consider that gold stolen , given there is not even a proof it actually exists in that vault . 
  actually , it is ( see the bierverordnung which declares parts of the vorl\u00e4ufiges biergesetz as still valid , also see the rules for creating bottom-fermenting ^ 1 beer ) . 
  it has law-like status without actually being called a law anymore . 
  [ 1 ] thank you , dict.leo.org, 
  you ca n't legally call it a `` beer '' if it does n't follow the rules . 
  btw : i think the rules are there for a reason , and they should persist . 
  time to rid myself of all investments and start buying ( physical ) gold . 
  five more years , at most . 
  we were n't even the spark . 
  the austrians were . 
   germany might have started the war it is an accepted historical fact that we did * not * start ww1 . 
  in fact , the first declaration of war was the one by austria-hungary on 28 july 1914 . 
  what followed was a chain-reaction of military pacts being put into action . 
   he was n't the one who moved troops into a neighbouring country 's territory , russia was . 
  actually , that only holds water for as long as you realize that the de-facto-regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia are recognized as independant nations by russia . 
  russia moving peacekeeping troops there is akin to the west moving peacekeeping troops to the kosovo ( which , by the way , is not recognized by russia or - for that matter - russian-affiliated serbia ) . 
   in what world is attempting to restore that territory to georgian government 's control `` a war of aggression '' ? 
  in what world is attempting to restore the polish-controlled german ostgebiete to the german govermnent 's control `` a war of aggression '' ? 
  see how easily your line of reasoning falls once you see another perspective ? 
  abkhazia and south ossetia were relatively peaceful in '08 - until they were being militarily assaulted by georgian troops . 
  the one who starts an attack is by default the aggressor - he wages a `` war of aggression '' . 
  you might read what other , more reliable ( as in : actually knowledgeable about geostrategic and military operations ) organisations and analysts had to say about that war - it 's right under the part of the eu 's class report of mutual guilt in the very article you 're linking . 
  actually , minus the civil war thing , that sounds almost exactly like the german political system . 
  i fear we already live in your future . 
   he was semi-autocratic at times and not the model of leadership during the war with russia and its puppet regimes , but overall not bad considering the quality of leadership in post-soviet countries in general . 
  yep , the guy who * begged * the us to support him in his war of aggression ( that was times to coincide with the olympic opening ceremony in beijing , fucking with the idea of peaceful contest ) against fucking russia and who wanted to create ww3 over some territories the size of a county , overall did not bad . 
  you can solve the embassy problem easily . 
  `` of course we 're going to help you , citizen . 
  for the small fee of 500 quid per inquiry that is outside of the focus of counsulary services . 
  per incident . '', 
  also known as `` common courteousy '' . 
  it 's reassuring to know europe 's madmen government sees things level-headed once in a while . 
   `` the internet is new territory for all of us '' . 
  actually , she used `` neuland '' , which is a lot more like * terra incognita , here be dragons * than `` i 've never been there , but i know it exists '', 
  hey , it 's not like the irish have a monopoly on insane law-and-order politicians . 
  it 's a worldwide phenomeon ( over here , some guy told us the other day that he thinks google streetview is a great thing , for now the police can check on the streets in real-time ) . 
  you mean , not everyone happily jumps into a plane for a multi-hour trip to attend a funeral of a person who used terrorist tactics , morphed to a nice peace-talking uncle afterwards and who they most likely did n't even personally know ? 
  the horror . 
  probably better translated as `` the guy who has been our au\u00dfenminister in the last four years has been openly gay for two decades '' . 
  that being said : i do n't like him , but when he brought his husband to a state visit to iran , he showed some serious balls . 
  taking personal responsibility . 
  a behaviour bush 2 did n't show . 
  so what will happen is that the police will stand just outside of that shop and start taking driving licenses from patrons .
