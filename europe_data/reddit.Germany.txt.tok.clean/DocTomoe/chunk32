  marijuana consumnation is probable cause of not being mentally ripe enough to operate a vehicle . 
  stuttgart has a population of 613.392 - the game says it 's 1,980,000 people . 
  that 's when the game obviously was making shit up , and it 's likely other cities are equally inflated . 
  thus it is unsolveable . 
  97 % in 1:31 seconds on the first run ( mistook crete for cyprus ), 
  you seem to [ x ] lack a sufficient understanding of the grundgesetz [ x ] have not understood this is n't about the opposition, 
  different times . 
  the spd will be a * very * difficult coalition partner , knowing well that if they relive merkel i , in the next elections they will be in the single digits . 
  merkel has a way of making her coalition partners seem obsolete . 
  an unrestful germany is a very dangerous thing for europe as well , and a grand coalition is an unrestful one . 
  frankly , i think the effects of politics to the country i am living in are more important than the effects to europe . 
  europe is n't going to pay my rent , my unemployment benefits or give me another job . 
  europe also is n't going to change the grundgesetz . 
  actually , i do n't think an cdu absolute majority would have been * worse * for the country . 
  an coalition with two thirds of the bundestag under it 's wing is a very , very , very dangerous thing . 
  which , given the inflation that will be fanned by such a measure , is pretty much like burning their money - without the added benefit of warmth . 
   remember that you 'd have to start a new company every time you have more than 4 employees in one company . 
  actually , the workers * can * form a br when they reach five , but in reality , those easily can be controlled ( by making them understand that a betriebsrat would limit their carreer chances ) . 
  this becomes unfeasible at around 300 employees . 
  well , noone wants to live where there are no jobs . 
  as far as i have heard , though , the boh\u00e9me currently moves from berlin to leipzig because of berlin becomming too expensive , so i guess things will change . 
   if several companies are run by the same entity * if * . 
  you would be surprised how creative you can get with company registrations and foundations . 
  actually , they 've hired me because i am the cheapest who will do this kind of job at this quality level - in this way , it 's just like any employer-employee relationship . 
  and believe me , i work much more than only half an hour extra a day . 
  people who let their hammer fall at 5pm are nothing we respect . 
  well , for instance , the betriebsrat ( = the body responsible for worker 's co-representation ) often has * huge * ties with the unions . 
  our unions strike rarely , and if they do , they make sure not to cause too much of a ruckus . 
  i think the last general strike was in 1948 , strikes afterwards often were one day or two ... maybe a week , but that 's rare . 
  betriebsr\u00e4te mostly work as job securing devices because the representatives are no longer fireable , so everyone wants to be one . 
  most often , they are merely legal advisors to the workers and wield no real power against the company - because the representatives prefer belonging to the ruling class instead of actually acting against them . 
  in short : they are pretty superfluidous . 
  well , considering this article and this thread is about germany , let 's not forget about the scope , shall we ? 
  that being said , i do n't think i have ever seen a cubicle over here . 
  i would * kill * for a cubicle instead of the open-floor plan we have now . 
  before i am answering what seems to be a thoughtful post , which is not applicable to the german situation - you are familiar with our system , right ? 
  90 % of all statistics are made up on the spot , right ? 
  so , how many millions of their own investment will they lose should the company go belly-up ? 
  instead , their wages will be continued by the arbeitsagentur for a few months so they can find something else ( `` insolvenzgeld '' ), 
  i guess then you 'll just love your unemployment benefits , and whatever else you might be entitled to . 
  it 's not really the point . 
  we have a huge number of unemployed just waiting to get a job that is freed because someone feels like they 're better than working half an hour extra a day . 
  actually , i am in software development - and i think benefits have to be earned , not to be given out because of some political knick-knack , to not damage a system . 
  compared to average wages , unionized wages are ridiculously high , thus inflated . 
   someone has to decide how much they 're being paid , just because the workers actually have an influence in the matter given that the workers carry zero risk in a company , why should they ? 
  well , if that 's the case , i guess you just love your unemployment benefits ( and the alms that is hartz4 after a year ) . 
   you mean that company is managed by inept individuals ? 
  because that is what they would be demonstrating by doing what you say . 
  why would it be inept to get more work out of less people ? 
   or abusers , that is criminals , if their solution is to take the work but not paying for it we call it `` vertrauenszeit '' . 
  it 's rather common ... 
  so common that some of our music bands actually have [ written songs about such practices ] ( http://www.universal-music.de/deichkind/videos/detail/video:270107/bueck-dich-hoch ) . 
  you want to be a teamplayer , right ? 
  actually , it means the employees in large firms are getting representation and hugely inflated wages ( because of the representation ) , while the regular employee in the mittelstand can suck it ... 
  the markets will cause competition , and that competition will be over wages : cheaper employees = better chances . 
  such a huge win for the german worker . 
  which is why there are a lot of companies just under that treshold ( hiring stop ) or getting split into two . 
   it 'll make no difference if you work for mcd , bk , starb or aldi because they will probably go for minimum wage . 
  of course you think that job training requirements for a job at mcdonalds are the same as those for aldi . 
  they 're not - each has a three-year apprenticeship requirement ( `` systemgastronom '' for the fast food branches , `` einzelhandelskaufmann / - frau '' for aldi ) it also means that people now earning slightly more than a proposed minimal wage will get downgraded to it ... 
  the argument works the other way round , too : a worker who brings in less than he earns ( for the company ) gets fired . 
  suddenly , companies will question if they really need a janitorial service after all , making their regular employees do those chores and thus lowering their productivity ( or making them take unpaid overtime for those ) . 
  works for all cases where cost of productivity loss < cost of increased wages . 
  well , so let 's spend like drunk sailors and hope the next crash/global military conflict wo n't wipe all of us out , i guess . 
  people who live in hyperinflation-struck countries are people at unrest . 
  people at unrest means bad things for their neighbors . 
  europe has lived in the longest period of peace also because of the bundesbank 's anti-inflationary policies . 
  ... leading to more people from the parts where they earn less moving to those parts of the country where they earn more , thus leading to more unemployment in the `` richer '' parts of the country , because suddenly there 's to little work for all the newcommers . 
  great idea . 
  so the worth of work should be determined by need , not by the actual work being done ? 
  is the work of a glass surface hygiene manager ( actual job description in my company ) worth any less if it is done in rostock compared to munich ? 
   comparing greece to germany is obviously farcical . 
  i never did , but at the current point in time , i agree with you . 
  but let 's not forget how wages roared in greece compared to germany in the 2000s , shall we ? 
  see also : ireland , spain , portugal , france ... ( i think france will be the next to demand a bailout ... )  even capitalist extremists like the uk and us have a minimum wage . 
  they also * wage wars ( = easy way to dump people with few skills into an environment with high probability to get them killed , and out of the unemployment statistics while at the same time subsidizing high-tech firms by buying overpriced military hardware ) , * threaten countries which do not want to use pretty worthless dollars for international commerce with bombings and invasion , * glorify inflation as something ** good ** , because fuck you , small savers , * and pretty much act antagonistic to the eu in every conceivable aspect of our relations , so ... those are not exactly good examples . 
  [ ] ( / twireally ) what you 're really saying is `` let 's import more plastic crap from third-world-countries and fuck up our economy at the same time '' . 
  minimum wagers wo n't exactly buy domnestically - or even eu-created products - too expensive . 
  yes , the moment we 're talking hard data , suddenly it 's not good enough . 
  we know that tactic all too well . 
  i think we 're best served with the simple rule : never touch a running system . 
  our system works . 
  why risk crashing it ? 
  unemployment rate = people registered as searching for a job / ( working people + registered jobseekers ) * 100 % in real numbers , 2.801.000 persons are registered as seeking for a job . 
  current statistics at http://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de, 
  [ ] ( / tavireally ) shall we start comparing unemployment rates vs minimum wage laws ? 
  ** edit ** : data point for germany : 5,1 % unemployment ( mostly skewed because of the east ) , no minimum wage . 
   while making germans a lot ~ ~ richer ~ ~ poorer and more unemployed . 
  ftfy, 
  i do n't think it will come . 
  we 're at the end of an economic boom phase . 
  when this is about to get enacted into law , unemployment will sharply rise , and minimal wage will suddenly be considered even more damaging that it actually is . 
  that 's the time when merkel will consider scrapping the rule `` alternativlos '' - and that 's about it . 
  women on boards now are considered to have gotten there by merit . 
  women on board when this has happened will be considered to be there to fulfill the quota , making their work worthless . 
  but that 's just the eu way : devalue work . 
   solar from [ . . ] north africa yeah , because we learned north africa is such a reliable and stable partner ... 
   the reichsarbeitsdienst targeted only a specific part of the population - the poor , uneducated , diadvantaged , powerless . 
  actually , the rad was a compulsory service time for * everyone * right just before of military service . 
  it was not the third reich 's variant of 1-euro-jobs .
