  political leverage without the military power to wield it is worthless . 
  much better to have stayed creators and dealers than work in a field we can nothing gain from . 
   if you want to be cynical , germany failed twice to restore the glory of the old empire which never was the reason for any war we were involved in . 
   it 's funny because nobody here wants to be in control , but if things continue like they are , then it may be inevitable . 
  i hope they start increasing the defense budget then . 
  all speech and no stick will only get us into a worse position . 
  if we 're going to play superpower , we better * are * a superpower . 
  so , you decided that we were to be treated `` fairly '' ... until you decided you did n't ? 
  if you forfeited the money , then you ca n't bring it up decades later . 
  as for `` orders of that magnitude '' : the reparations thing was linked to the idea that we stopped doing some things , like waging unprovoked wars . 
  we held our side of the bargain . 
  the european help comes with some cavecats as well , such as you not getting the cash and burning it right away . 
  after 1914 , germany has stopped giving away blanco cheques . 
   this could not have gone much better for germany . 
  the only question is : * because * of the euro , or * despite * of the euro ? 
  the answer differs according to which economics professor you listen to . 
  how about you start accepting that you already forfeited that money ( if it was a war reparation claim ) or the statute of limitations has passed ( if it was , like you claim , theft ) . 
  do we really need to chew through this again ? 
   hundreds of billions of gold bars til greece once had more gold bars than exist in the history of earth . 
  aliens ? 
  good for them . 
  now if they also asked for the real price of their services instead of the heavily-discounted price we gave you in addition to the bribery ... 
  oh , the eurozone functions exactly as designed : as an europeization of the l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich - something we have been lied to for fifteen years of this never going to happen ... we do n't like it , and we will see what the elections will bring . 
  ... says the guy with the berlin flair . 
  well , that explains a lot . 
   mostly it 's about us beating the snot out off the them in naval battles . 
  ist that olds law still valid what allows every danish to beat swedes dead with sticks if they come `` walking over the sea '' ? 
  how does this work with the modern-age \u00d8resund bridge ? 
  well , death is the one big equalizer . 
  ... thus invoking the streisand effect . 
  a job well done , pr person at the wiesenthal center . 
  when they started catering to [ fringe groups ] ( http://popcornpiraten.de/polizeilich-durchgesetztes-hausverbot-gegen-ehemal-vorstandsmitglied-lv-niedersachsen-auf-der-piratinnenkon/ ) while violating their very own basic rules , they were doomed . 
  ah , well , let 's see if the afd is any good . 
  [ people die when we are proud ] ( http://satwcomic.com/evil-flag ), 
  austerity delayed by months did n't work . 
  immediate austerity we still have to check . 
   it actually appears that you nato guys are just happy to rent ukrainian ans whenever you need to ship your military to some not so distant location , like afghanistan or mali . 
  yes , because renting is way cheaper than owning . 
  it 's common sense - and frugal . 
   baltic states will crumble first like georgia did in 2008 . 
  poland and ukraine will be next . 
  after romania is done , your turn will come . 
  so what you 're saying is that mother russia is out to get us ? 
  i very much doubt that . 
   or you will be charged so much for the gas that you economy will default and bought out by gazprom . 
  you are aware gazprom is not our main supplier , nor is gas our main source of energy ? 
  do n't project the shortcommings of the ukrainian economy to the west . 
  hahahaha , yeah , sure . 
  first , nato is overrated . 
  secondly , nato wo n't allow central europe to be dominated by anyone that would be able to do so . 
  it 's a direct threat to our neighbors . 
  thirdly , we do n't need most of the spending - we 're quite capable of domnestic protection without long-range military delivery planes or the hn90 . 
  heh , everything is possible if you have the political will to do it . 
  what is the world going to do ? 
  invade us for no longer giving monies to the third world to buy water pumps ? 
  what is your problem ? 
  * every * state can easily slash a few percent . 
  let 's have an example : http://www.bundeshaushalt-info.de/startseite/#/2013/soll/ausgaben/einzelplan.html germany has a spending of 302 billion euros . 
  10 % are this around 30 billion . 
  end the bundesministerium for economic cooperation and development : 6.3 billion euros saved . 
  only buy every other eurofighter : 0.5 billion saved . 
  stop the a400 program : 0.725 billion saved . 
  only buy half the ships we want : 0.300 billion saved . 
  only use every other bullet : 0.180 billion saved . 
  stop the uh90 helicopter program : 0.230 billion saved . 
  cut the cultural exchange with foreign countries by half : 0.4 billion saved . 
  cut the `` general accounting '' by half : 10 billion saved . 
  stop the `` bundesfreiwilligendienst '' : 0.242 billion saved ( and a ton of new jobs created , because that work now has to be done by * paid * workers , thus lowering the cost for work assistance programs ) . 
  well , almost there . 
  now strike anything else down by 2 % , and we 're here . 
  and nothing much of value was lost . 
  first , you are talking about 100000 when wikipedia talks about 200000 . 
  ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%bcrken_in_berlin ) second , you are implying that they mix with the nonturkish population when clearly there is a ghettoization of people with migratory backgrounds . 
  you 'll find very few turkish in gr\u00fcnewald , kreuzberg , on the other hand ... thirdly , i never said anything about extremist islamism . 
  i am saying that there are areas in berlin that are no longer being controlled by germans . 
   now tell me how you are not exaggerating tell me how you 're not trying to twist my words before they left my mouth . 
   describes the policy itself `` lower the debt by spending less than you earn . '', 
  works pretty well . 
  technically , article x of the treaty of utrecht is about the city , castle , port and the fortresses , * not * necessarily the ground they stand on . 
  without such ground , there 's no territory , and thus no territorial waters . 
  technically , with the police retracting from hotspots , some areas of berlin are de facto no longer under german control . 
   austerity is defined as `` the deliberate deflation of domestic wages citation needed . 
  relevant to this topic : [ cod wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cod_wars ), 
  you have the right to protest - to the extend of the law . 
  once your protests become a problem to other people 's rights , there has to be an objective cost/benefit analysis - and frankly , if i was a storeowner for ... let 's say , antique books at the taksim place right now , i 'd be pissed because those protests and anything that comes with it ruins my business and my livelyhood . 
  yes . 
  and for as long as there is no other election , the turkish government is * de jure * perfectly fine to both building that mall as well as ensuring safety on the streets by driving away and/or jailing violent protestors . 
  if you have a dissenting voice , you * can * go the juidical route and try to win in front of the judges . 
  of course , then you would have to proove laws have been broken by the government . 
  turkey actually is one of the fastest-growing economies in the eme theatre . 
   i dare you to defend this . 
  try . 
  it was the greek public broadcaster . 
  the greek government , as representatives of the greek people , have any right to shut them down . 
   you forget to mention stuttgart 21 and the elbphilharmonie btw . 
  actually , look at the other two links , 
  note that germany is [ currently ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elbe_philharmonic_hall ) [ rather ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_brandenburg_airport ) [ bad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stuttgart_21 ) with large-scale construction projects . 
  i am looking into my crystal ball and see construction being delayed for at least two years and cost overrun by 300 % ... 
  the main difference being that there actually were ruins of the frauenkirche and noone built something that could be considered an architectual feat ( see : palast der republik ) on it . 
  this reeks of victor 's justice by the west .
