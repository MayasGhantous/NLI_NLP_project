  ... and we took inspiration from * you *  the polish `` madagascar plan '' was thus scrapped . 
  following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 , the ss revived the idea of sending jews to madagascar . 
  stop putting on the mask of the innocent . 
  poland was not that much better , they just had the fortune of having been stopped by the war before they took the same steps we eventually did . 
   and you call my ancestors terrorists ? 
  i pointed out that at that time , they were seen as those ( as evidenced in contemporary military reports ) . 
  nowadays , they were `` freedom fighters '' , which essentially is the same thing , only for people that are liked . 
   they were soldiers of polish underground state . 
  as that one was not given any recognition by us , that was not really a state , more a terrorist/resistance movement . 
  essentially , it would be like al-quaeda claiming statehood . 
  for a state to exist , you need a people , a territory you can sucessfully defend , and the power to rule within . 
  the so-called polish underground state lacked both the defendable territory as well the the power to rule . 
  thus , even by modern political standards , it was never a state . 
   you mention stroop 's report and tell me that what polish jews did was comparable to terrorist activity ? 
  fine - but it 's better to be a terrorist trying to sacrifice his life killing sons of bitches that killed millions of jews than wait to be butchered like an animal . 
  i 'm not saying that the jewish insurgents were terroists , nor that their actions were deplorable . 
  i was pointing out that language matters . 
   it is personal issue , the memory of war is still fresh . 
  ... and playing the victim forevermore is so nice , giving you sympathy for everything . 
  how about 70 years after the war 's end , you stop wailing and get to build some respect for yourself ? 
  stereotypes changes perceptions . 
  you think we are all war-mongering nazis just about to get another piece of underdeveloped unagrarable land from you . 
  we ^ 1 fancy the stereotype that polish people are mostly sad car thieves who lack the ability to smile . 
  nothing good can come from such stereotyping . 
  [ 1 ] just for the naysayers who will come to tell me that i should n't talk for us all : ` we ' in this context means ' a large subset of germans ' . 
   uh , so , you 're not really proving me wrong here , given that the only actual example you 've provided is the american occupation of iraq . 
  * alright . 
  let 's play `` who 's the oppressor ? '' . 
  how about tibetan terrorists attacking the chinese pla ? 
   the suppression of the warsaw uprising is not what made the nazis infamous excuse me ? 
   what made them infamous was the mass slaughter of villages because of some slight connection to partisan activity , and , oh right , the einsatzgruppen and gas chambers that killed millions of polish ( and other ) citizens simply for being of the wrong ethnic background . 
  well , genocide is not something that is particularily * german * , is it ? 
  that being said , i am not aware of an order to single out polish citizens for mass-exterminations for the virtue of being polish . 
  that the polish had jewish citizens is true , but not relevant in this context , as [ antisemitic thoughts were prevalent in interwar poland . 
  ] ( http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/reading/total/polish%20antisemitism.htm ) you ca n't hate them when it 's convinient and then claim them to be of your own when it 's convinient a few years later . 
   for the warsaw uprising , you 're counting all deaths of poles compared to the total population of warsaw . 
  actually , 400k people was the population of the ghetto . 
   fallujah has 300,000 + inhabitants . 
  at the time of the battle : no . 
  most civilians - thankfully - fled in time . 
  you are aware that whenever there is an occupation , the resistance is called `` insurgents '' or `` terrorists '' ? 
  of course , if you happen to have sympathy with the people being surpressed , suddenly the very same guys are `` heroes '' and `` freedom fighters '' . 
  are you aware that the us hardly is the only one currently ocupying and surpressing foreign peoples ? 
  what i was pointing out is that the much-hated nazi german troops more often than not engaged in antipartisan operations just like any occupying military force does , with the very same line of reasoning as is prevalent today . 
  but you are right in connecting the dots , there is little difference between the `` cleaning of the warsaw ghetto '' and `` operation phantom fury '' - even the battle death rates are highly similar ( 23,67 % in warsaw ^ 1 vs. 24 % in phantom fury ^ 2 ) . 
  the time we can finally agree that war is a dirty , dirty thing and not to be touched will be the day when finally we can see that killing civilians is bad , and should be condemned , regardless of the color of the offending party 's uniform . 
  [ 1 ] 71000 deaths on the polish side ( stroop inofficial number , official is 13000 ) out of a population of 400k people ( german estimates ) [ 2 ] 1200 deaths on the iraqi side out of a population of 5000 people ( numbers from wikipedia ) . 
  you know , i never even used the word iraq - or america . 
  it 's interesting how you draw that conclusion . 
  maybe your subconscious was seeing a pattern here . 
  yes , it is . 
  so once you have spent your first day in school , you 're your country 's slave , forever ? 
  education eventually is paid up , with profits . 
  your part of infrastructure is eventually paid up , with profits - and your workforce you pay yourself . 
  it 's called wages . 
   we are all , including turkey , signatories to the european convention of human rights . 
  hungary , anyone ? 
  why not first solve problems that have existed for longer ? 
   a significant amount of our citzens are also turkish citizens , or turkish descendants . 
  so many of ` our ' people also have a direct connection to this in germany , most of those are the more-islamic , more rural and more-akp leaning people . 
  i do n't know if that 's what we should consider as our measuring stone . 
   there 's at the least a big chance that they 'll be part of the eu in the future . 
  no , there is n't . 
  not as long as germany is part of the eu . 
  i just want to come here to point out that * some * of us do believe in statedom and the three-elements-rule by jellinek . 
  oh , * someone * hears the song of the past . 
  do n't worry , we do n't want you anymore . 
  we have taken up a backward ex-socialist country and it almost destroyed us , we do n't need that experience again . 
  do you apply the same logic to supermarkets ? 
  supermarket a has ravioli for 2 euros . 
  suddenly , supermarket b opens up next door and has ravioli for 1,40 euros . 
  if customers now go to supermarket b , is it taking supermarket a 's money , or just the money of the consumers ? 
   nor the last act of german anti-polish nationalism - and germany has never apologized for it excuse me ? 
  [ seems the polish media has a short attention-span ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-02/news/mn-22740_1_warsaw-uprising-poland ), 
  just because you 're not paranoid does not mean we 're not out there to get you . 
   over 16 % of polish citizens died during ii ww and only 1 % of belgian citizens . 
  most of the polish did n't die in death camps , either . 
  they died as collateral in war operations , which is hardly surprising considering poland was * the * major battlefield in the european theatre * twice * - and in anti-terrorist operations ( make my day . 
  read the stroop report . 
  notice how the talk about insurgents and terrorists sounds awfully familiar to more recent military operations on another continent ) . 
  more importantly , their [ training wing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/training_air_wing,_finnish_air_force ) still uses it today . 
  oh , i would love to hear what actually is more moronic to them than the key disclosure law ( `` regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 '' ) in the uk ... 
   they find jobs , actually , asylum seekers in germany are forbidden to work . 
   the map you provided is for nyc proper , not the suburbs . 
  when us people talk about suburbs , they think about winding roads with mcmanisons . 
  when europeans talk of suburbs , especially when it comes to problematic ones , we think of [ banlieues ] ( http://www.bsavenir.fr/homepages/15/d310812895/sitebsavenir/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/juillet-banlieu.jpg ) , which is more something resembling the bronx . 
   and in the us the dangerous areas with a lot of minorities are n't really immigrant areas , crime in the us comes mostly from native-born americans . 
  crime by people with migration backgrounds comes from second-generation immigrants over here . 
  as most european countries have ius sanguis , those are n't necessarily `` native-born '' . 
   an ethnic underclass segregated in the suburbs of big cities in the us ? 
  where exactly ? 
  [ here you are - ethnicity ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/01/23/nyregion/20110123-nyc-ethnic-neighborhoods-map.html?_r=0 ) cross-examine those with income levels and crime rate , and you might see a correlation . 
  with asylum seekers ... no , not really . 
  we have our issues with second-generation gastarbeiter , actually ( gastarbeiter is someone who came here to work on the premise that eventually he/she would leave again . 
  few did , but they are n't exactly immigrants either , as they do usually not try to get citizenship ) . 
  all the time , actually . 
  from time to time , though , we have to force them ( we call it `` abschiebung '' ), 
   the result : the creation of an ethnic underclass segregated in the suburbs of the big cities . 
  actually , that 's exactly what we see in us urban areas as well . 
  so ... where is the overwhelming welfare state and the strong unions in the us ?
