  to solve this problem , you need to make taxes just , either by * lowering them for all ( and cut benefits ) or * making everyone pay everything and have someone decide their need - because a dirty rag to wear is good enough for everyone , and a stalk of celery is enough for a week . 
  of course , the latter has been tried in the past , which led to a leading caste of bureaucrats who lived in luxury while everyone else was miserable . 
  some countries still try today , see north korea . 
  ca n't decide if you 're pro or anti high taxes . 
  our infrastructure is falling apart , and we got high-ranking politicians telling us they want to build internet backbones `` for eternity '' . 
  our military does everything but actually fight . 
  we got an aggressive superpower to our east ( russia ) and we got one to our west ( the us ) . 
  education is mediocre , we are no longer able to build simple things like airports anymore without screwing up , we have areas with 20 % and more unemployment , raging ecological damage , we 're on the brink of losing energy security thanks to the ausstieg ... ... but sure , let 's fight anti-semitism . 
  because obviously that 's a useful way to spend our ceo 's time . 
  well , how about we all just pay 100 % of our income to our tax offices , and then some perfectly fair bureaucrat will decide what each of us is entitled to have ? 
  both are considered `` waterbombs '' in germany , though . 
  given how easy it is to grow your own ... never gon na buy foreign tomatos again . 
  so , tl ; dr : like everyone else , you use the eu as a nice dumping point for politicians who could n't compete in their own countries anymore ? 
  oettinger for `` digital economy and society '' is a big fuck you to the internet and civil rights - not because he is maleficent , he 's just so incompetent it 's almost funny . 
  as left as you get before going down the communist path . 
   i think most people ( badener and bavarians ) did you just consider stuttgart a badenian city ? 
  hahaha , stuttgart as the new capital of `` greater bavaria '' . 
  there 'd be riots on the streets . 
  both from munichers and stuttgarters . 
  i 'm all for it , as long as every bundesland holds a referendum if or if not it 's population wants to actually join the eu , and it 's result being legally binding . 
  ah , i 'm not questioning the abc numbers . 
  i 'm questioning the claim that they 're half of the worldwide neo-nazi population until we get some good statistics about how many neo nazis there are in the world ( and , for that matter , get a good definition of what constitutes a neo nazi ) . 
  i support the recognition of the kosovoran republic by germany , just because any people have a right to self-determination . 
  of course , that applies to * any * people , so i also support the ( de-facto or future ) independences of scotland , abkhazia , tibet , lugansk and bavaria . 
   half the worlds neo-nazis live in russia . ^ [ citation_needed ], 
  oh god , thank you so much ... maybe / r/europe becomes more readable again . 
  you 're downvoted because you 're speaking reason in / r/europe . 
  you should know better . 
  here , we cheer at the dawn of ww3 . 
  ah , just get a swedish vpn already like everyone else . 
  [ i call double combo ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=woosh ) ... are you new to the internet or just trolling ? 
  oh , i understand ... as you can not into space to have a look , you rely on bad information from wikipedia . 
  actually , central europe , that 's pretty much us ( denmark/germany/liechtenstein / italy ) . 
  you , sir , are in east europe . 
  but then , i guess everyone thinks of their own place as `` central '', 
  hahaha , not gon na happen . 
  if britain can park their troops in poland , they can pay for their highways . 
  well , i 'd just love to buy a rifle , but we 're not free enough for that . 
   western europe infrastructure is n't really that bad you seem to believe the ** polish ** pm poposes that fund for anything but ** east-european ** interests . 
  they want east europe to get the money , and west europe to pay for it . 
  yes , it is . 
  but not paying a fine might be a pretense to make a random russian court order a stop to delivering at all . 
   also , where are they going to sue them ? 
  in russian court - good luck with that :d `` no gas until you pay up . '', 
  remember that winter is upon us . 
  honestly , let 's throw out britain first ... for the sake of not having to watch mummies doing the 1970s stuff again . 
  they will propose it knowing well that wo n't come through . 
   what everyone is waiting from germany is a sanction that has weight , in energy deal or something . 
  well , this is three people standing in a circle , putting guns to their heads , promising they will shoot themselves if the others shoot first . 
  we 're not wrecking our economy while madame france decides to `` not sell right now , but mayhaps tomorrow '' . 
  [ we already did a month ago ] ( http://www.dw.de/germany-stops-russian-arms-deal/a-17831571 ) . 
  the british and the french did n't move yet , though . 
  `` putting things on hold '' is not sufficient . 
  i just love how suddenly dealing weapons to russia becomes acceptable again , yet the only major eu country who cancelled it 's weapons deals with russia regularily is called out for `` not being hard enough to putin '' and `` only looks out for it 's own economy 's interests '' . 
  / r/europe logic at it 's finest, 
  you 're supposed to steal them ? 
  we only fell them with chainsaws . 
  obvious phallic heathen spring-symbolism and such . 
  `` suspends '' = not `` cancels '' . 
  `` we 'll sell to moscow once the dust has settled . '', 
   numerous photos , videos , satellite images , instagram/facebook posts to confirm the fact . 
  all those things ( minus instagram and facebook ) also confirmed the presence of wmds in iraq . 
  i was unaware that they eat the mosque grounds . 
  ah , the president of hearts . 
  i would have preferred a president of brains . 
  technically , ukraine played both sides like a fiddle in the last two decades ... and eventually one side snapped . 
  t'wasn ' t us , though . 
  enlist , train , become a mercenary . 
  i had not heard of that before . 
  do you have a link ? 
  my google-fu seems week today . 
  note that while they talk about thousands of weapons , they do n't talk about ammunition for the rifles and pistols . 
  it would also piss off the nato neighbor state turkey , whose territorial integrity is directly threatened by a future kurdish state . 
  it 's the current version : [ helpful wikipedia link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panzerfaust_3 ), 
   you have told me to leave the sub on numerous occasions . 
  that is n't censorship ? 
  actually , no , that is not censorship . 
  censorship would necessiate that your written words and thoughts would no longer be available to be read . 
  my links are friendly reminders that there are subs out there you might enjoy more with the worldview you are obviously endorsing . 
   what are you suggesting with your claim i am fascinated with poland ? 
  i 'd rather not put words in your mouth and am curious on your answer . 
  i just notice you bring up poland a lot , like it held some special importance to you . 
  maybe you have polish ancestry , or a girlfriend there . 
  maybe you 're a history buff and like stories about the [ battle of the ice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_ice ) . 
  maybe you enjoy [ polish buffalo grass vodka ] ( http://www.beveragewarehouse.com/search/more_info.php?item_id=3089 ) ( which reminds me , i should stock up on that stuff ... christmas is coming ) ? 
  there are wild regions , and there are `` wild '' regions . 
  i will take your advice into consideration , though . 
  i have great respect for wildlife , especially wildlife that might be lethal . 
  actually , yes , by trekking i meant hiking  thanks for all your info . 
   you think germany is using elderly women on the front lines versus the professional armies used in the rest of europe ? 
  i do not . 
  but i do know we will again if the shit hits the fan and regular troops are not sufficient , as a last line of defense . 
   you use quotes around medically discharged as if that is a thing that does n't exist . 
  as long as you can breath , you can fight in some capacity . 
  if the shit hits the fan , just a missing leg will not spare you from not serving . 
   r/europe is n't as xenophobic as you are . 
  i am not xenophobic . 
  i just do not like being dragged into a military conflict on behalf of a country which has played both the russians and us europeans for the last twenty years and now has folded . 
  i do not like being dragged into a conflict because `` hurr durr , it 's our old enemy '' , or because first-semester-students at some danish/british/dutch / us university think it 's better to heroically drum the war drums on the internet during their lecture than take notes . 
  and i do not see why my job security should be threatened because the polish feel angsty about their neighbor .
