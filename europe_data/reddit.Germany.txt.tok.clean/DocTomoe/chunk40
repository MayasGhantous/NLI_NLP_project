  both transsexualism and otherkin do exist . 
  thus he does raise a good point , even if the vast majority does not fall into his camp : how far will social justice in the end have to go ? 
   because fucktards still voting for the cdu/csu . 
  there are many valid reasons to vote conservative in germany . 
  elections are not a single-issue thing , and thank $ deity for that . 
  seriously , that 's kind of a dumb argument you give . 
  for the simple reason as it would raise sympathies with those cultures , who in many respects are a lot less free not only on the topic of ssms , but more important issues . 
  in short : `` those arabs are right about gays marrying , maybe they are right on other things like woman drivers and executions for sex offenders as well '' ... 
  i would wager that had it not been for fukushima , baw\u00fc still would have voted black - for the simple reason that while state politics was a factor , most of us wanted to lay the issue to rest already . 
  to be fair , * any * new party not obviously communist is usually at first considered a right-wing party in germany ( yes , even the pirates were tried to be constructed as nazi sympathisants when they became `` too successful '' ), 
  the fun thing is that we already had an anti-euro party before who noone seems to remember : [ pro deutsche mitte - pro dm ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/pro_deutsche_mitte_%e2%80%93_initiative_pro_d-mark ), 
  not with the contenders there are . 
  steinbr\u00fcck , main other guy got candidate status and the very next day claimed that he thinks chancellors are paid to little - as the candidate for the socialist party . 
  noone thinks anything about the fdp winning anymore . 
  the greens ? 
  not unless a nuclear plant blows up a week before the elections , ideally somewhere far away ( that 's how one of them became ministerpr\u00e4sident of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ) . 
  they are considered conservative . 
  most of the leading figures are economists and university professors . 
  other than re-questioning the euro ( they are for an reevaluation and an election for or against it , not necessarily it 's immediate dismantlement ; of course , there is no question how an election on remaining in the eurozone would turn out ) , change of immigration laws to be more like the canadian model ... 
  i really should look up more about them , but i 'm at work right now ... 
   '' ** we ** decide '' . 
  that 's an awfully bad translation , implying authoriatism [ 1 ] . 
  actually , it 's more `` the ` community ' decides '' or `` we as a community , as a people , as a group of people looking out for each other decide '' . 
  [ 1 ] almost as bad as this one : [ mokusatsu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mokusatsu ), 
   a party that gets less than 5 % will not enter the parliament . 
  ... unless this party manages to get people directly elected into parliament . 
  if they get three people , they are a fraktion again ... 
  the pds ( `` the party formerly known as the sed '' , nowadays pronounced ~ ~ symbol ~ ~ `` die linke '' ) managed to get into the bundestag a few times by that rule . 
  when was the last time anyone got into prison for blasphemy in germany ? 
  * looks it up * oh , not since the 1950s ... 
   no mate , it becomes illegal . 
  let 's ponder on this point a little . 
  technically , you unfortunately can not be put before a judge for violating the amtseid ^ 1 , and yet , morally , i do believe that once you violate it , you have lost your democratic legitimation , thus making the acts you do against it 's spirit un-democratic in the sense of the word . 
  [ 1 ] that should be changed . 
   the representatives take ** an oath ** to guard the interests of the people [ ... ] does it make it non-democratic ? 
  it becomes undemocratic the moment politicians actively violate the intend of that oath , which now happens on a regular basis . 
   but people do n't think longterm easily , so i would n't trust the majority ... 
  so you are a friend of non-democratic systems ? 
  nurses in germany ... that might be related to nurses having a hard job and get paid shit - * if * they are lucky . 
   that 's just `` small time crook '' level actually ... 
  i have a few other examples of not convicted criminals that are somewhat worse ( w. bush comes to mind at first place ) . 
  acting directly against the letters of the constitution , and worse of all , for his personal profit ( and not to save lifes : when schmidt did that in the hamburg flood , not only did we forgive him , he is considered a hero for it up to this day ) . 
  that 's a little more than a small-time crook . 
  but yes , of course , there are worse people . 
  kohl is not pol pot . 
  then , i guess , kohl would n't have what it takes . 
   he just made a choice for the people against their will ... 
  he violated his oath of office . 
  it was very , very clear that the euro was diametral to the welfare of the german people - we pointed out the very obvious flaws back when we first got the idea told , which just happen to be the flaws that now have led us where we are . 
  by the way , social security - when it started in my country - was highly popular , and still is . 
  this is not the us   but now you 'll tell me that 's bad too to which i 'll direct you to / r/libertarian [ 1 ] / and you 'll respond that i should go have sex with myself . 
  am i wrong ? 
   matter of fact , you are . 
  hahahahaha , yeah , sure . 
  *** someone *** should read up on kohl many achievements ( which include standing to his word of honour when it came to give out names who ~ ~ bribed ~ ~ gave money to his party when the constitution demanded he do so ) . 
  this guy is a criminal on the level of nixon . 
  [ oh , really ? 
  ] ( http://blog.mdmadman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/youdontsay.png ) i still think this guy should be tried and put into prison for the many times he acted against his oath of office . 
  kohl is the single worst and destructive chancellor the federal republic ever had . 
  hint : if it easily rips and dissolves in water just as easily , it 's not a teacloth ... 
  become prime minister . 
  enact some policies that piss femen off . 
  announce appearance at semi-secure location with bad security . 
  their day will become a lot worse once the protester has been contained and the debriefing rolls in . 
  yes ... but if it is a banking matter , they would have no way to change the interest retroactively . 
  so that 's kind of a moot point . 
  also , it was not a `` loan '' , it was a forced buy of obligations . 
  which work even less flexibly than loans when it comes to interest . 
   the funeral would be held in london i suspected that because of her furneral likely not being too profitable , it would n't be held at all . 
  why invest in a loss leader ? 
  on what legal basis ? 
  essentially : 1 . 
  if it is a considered an interest-free loan by the greeks , then it can not bear interest , and we pay it out of the coffee fund . 
  if the greeks consider it theft , the statute of limitations have passed , both in german criminal law , as well as in greek criminal law . 
  if it is considered a war damage , the 1990 treaty kicks in . 
  so , what is it to be ? 
  let me tell you what will actually happen : nothing . 
  all the greeks will hear about this matter is laughter from berlin . 
  the thing is a non-issue for two reasons which [ forbes did explain a lot better than i ever could ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/09/12/does-germany-really-owe-greece-a-etrillion-in-war-reparations-probably-not-no/ ) . 
  i think her state funeral should be privatized . 
  you only should say good things about the dead , so ... it 's good that she 's dead . 
    we are risking our own russian supply to help you . 
  what a typically german attitude to the so-called `` european values '' . 
  [ actually , we do have problems with our own supply right now . 
  i am personally convinced that * every * system is a democracy - there is no such thing as a dictatorship . 
  if people are fed up enough with one system , they vote - either by ballot , or , if they do n't have that option and the problems for them are big enough , by use of revolutionary violence . 
  obviously , the psychological strain from authoritianism is not large enough yet in belarus , the ukraine or russia . 
   `` if someone does n't care for something for 60 years then it 's not his anymore '' i 'm for it if it is valid for any side ( including so-called `` beutekunst '' ) . 
   as a german , living with the experiences we had in the last 120 years or so , a people of `` terrorists '' is far more desireable to me than an exterminated people . 
  implying that i suspect something like that to happen when the world looks the other way . 
   you do n't need extermination camps to create a genocide . 
  which , as many peoples have learned the hard way , is an universal truth . 
  it is not me saying there is currently a genocide happening in israel . 
   on 15 june 1961 , it was true that there was no wall . 
  you misread the comment , or you seriously think that a person who laughed about the idea of a wall ( a word which he himself used for the first time in this context ) and the very same person started building just such a wall two months later is a mere coincidence . 
  if you believe in the latter , i doubt any good will come out of a discussion with who i would think as mentally challenge . 
   you 're claiming that there 's a genocide happening today nope . 
  you seem to have a reading disability . 
   srs stealing passwords etc ? 
  those are pretty serious claims .
