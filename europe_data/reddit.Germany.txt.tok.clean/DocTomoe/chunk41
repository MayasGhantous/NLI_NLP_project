  got any proof of that ? 
  personal experience . 
  comments appearing under my username that were inciteful and misgynist - with them starting an uproar against me . 
  my password being unknown suddenly and only to be changed after resetting it ... 
  yes , i know , circumstancial evidence , but for me that 's enough to know where i stand when it comes to them . 
   are you referring to creepshots and jailbait ? 
  oh , doxxing was not a violentacrez-only thing . 
  it happens all the time . 
  actually , there is no such things as austrian german . 
  til i learned about the source of that quote . 
  aaaand tagged `` potentially srs '' for using keywords ( in this case `` freezed peach '' as a mocking of `` free speach '' ) . 
  no link to srs in your comment history , but that 's probably because they like to keep their main account separate from their srs account . 
  in the moment an organisation starts to actively attack people by stealing passwords , falsifying comments , and starting to dig up accounts on other websites to create a personal profile to destroy ones existance , they are powerful enough to make people shut up . 
  this has happened in the past , it is still what ( some of them/they ) do , even when they do not admit it . 
  to know the enemy . 
  srs and what they claim to stand for is the single most dangerous group to the continued existance of free speech on reddit and to reddit itself . 
   what about china that oppresses tibet ? 
  i never got why one maniac theocracy is to be feared ( iran ) while an equally-brutal other theocracy is to be protected/their occupation is to be protested ( tibet ) . 
  yes , yes , the dalai lama does better marketing for his cause than ahmadinejad . 
  but the time we followed the ideas of charismatic leaders should be over post-45 , should n't it ? 
  what is ignorant is that you obviously can not distinguish between a comment about a language and a comment about the people usually speaking that language . 
  actually , the time on the job would be longer - but the pension would be paid until death , which usually is longer than three years , so it 's not a fair comparison , is it ? 
  also , usually , it 's higher than 55 % . 
  a massively incomplete list . 
  we call it `` pension '' . 
  every sane system has it . 
  you mean hollande ? 
  champion of the poor ? 
  `` tax em higher '' hollande ? 
  that 's why we have more conservative politicans : more reliable voters . 
  i would be interested in said script . 
  danger , will robinson : you are extremely close to surpressing ( potentially valid ) opinions that do not match yours , ministry of truth style . 
  freedom of expression always is the freedom of expression of the one thinking differently . 
  i had the great fortune of having studied under an english teacher who * insisted * on teaching us be - up to the point of creating his own copied materials instead of the provided textbooks . 
  from what i see from my younger silbings and their kids , these days you have one year of be , and the rest is a conglomerate of 90 % ae and 10 % be ( relation might be a little bit different , though ) . 
   that 's the actual genocide part , and nothing like those has happened in israel nor are the israelis planning on doing anything like that . 
  ( `` noone plans to build a wall '' , walter ulbricht , head of the gdr , on 15 ^ th of juni 1961 - two months before the berlin wall was built . ), 
   you 'd think a german , steeped in education about the holocaust , would be able to correctly identify a genocide . 
  what i , a german who had been spoonfed holocaust for most of his school career , can very well identify ghettos , rapant racism and fascistoid behavior when i see them . 
  you do n't need extermination camps to create a genocide . 
  what i see in the middle-east-conflict is something very , very similar to the warsaw uprising - an armed revolt of a majorly disadvantaged occupied people against a massively racist and disproportionally more powerful army . 
  which , by the way , did not end well for the warsaw citizens, 
  actually , nowadays close to noone learns english . 
  we all learn the bastardized american variant . 
  close enough , sure , but definitely not english . 
  every language is worth learning , because with speaking and thinking in a language come new ways of thinking about things - which might be enlightening . 
  languages are needed for communication with yourself as much as they are needed for communication with each other . 
  that 's a nice strawman you have here . 
  i could easily provide with quotes and links that would make any side look bad ( for example : [ forced birth control for jewish ethiopian immigrants to israel to keep the count of black israeli low ] ( http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/314-18/15744-focus-israel-admits-ethiopian-women-were-given-birth-control-shots ) ) . 
  it 's not a game of he said , she said . 
   ukraine now imports considerable amounts of natural gas from germany til we had natural gas fields to exploit . 
  oh , wait , we do n't . 
  instead , we are risking our own russian supply to help you . 
  did not deny anything you quoted . 
  just be sure that you understand that one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  as someone who lives in a country still under the daily threat of old mother russia shutting down your energy lines , i thought you might understand that . 
   insulate palestinian authority from the dreadful consequences of breeding hatered and terrorism . 
  as a german , living with the experiences we had in the last 120 years or so , a people of `` terrorists '' is far more desireable to me than an exterminated people . 
   this is why eu must stop sponsoring arab/paletinian terrorism . 
  teenage hosts of a tv show which was also affiliated with an ngop the eu happened to support reciting from a poem from the 1970s ... 
  i can already see the quassam rockets with the eu banner on them ... 
   the textbook had an article about a punk guy who can not get a job because of this `` mohawk '' haircut and this is discrimination actually , that 's bullshit . 
  punks get jobs all the way . 
  they do n't necessarily get the jobs they want , though . 
  for instance , banks would probably rather not have a heavily-tattooed , pierced , mohawk-haired punk serve at a counter because of public perception . 
  but that is not discriminatory . 
  he is not not hired because of his political views , but because of his free decision to have a phenotype unlike most of his surroundings . 
  unlike a black person , who ca n't really change his appearance , the punk can . 
  and how exactly are you supposed to do that ? 
  you have to hit the leadership where it hurts - which almost exclusively will be about money . 
  not doing research exchanges with a country makes research on their side more expensive ( and on your side , but that 's just taking one for the cause ) . 
  loss of souvereignity with very little to show for . 
  not to mention the eu is a nice tool for our politicians to enforce political decisions upon us that are unpopular within our country and did not get a majority in parliament . 
  also : highly undemocratic . 
  so , if i see injustice in the world ( regardless of what injustice ) i am just to suck it up and still support said group of people whose leadership is offending ? 
  he actually is supposed to live in saransk . 
  he only has a flat in this building . 
  grozny is no longer the civilwar torn hell we as we remember it from around the 2000s, 
   * obligatory comment about how the age of legal marriage is 14 for girls in vatican city *, 
  that 's how secure it is :p actually , the town i am living in , which is a minor one , is larger than vaduz . 
  the antifa i have seen and know is indistinguishable from anarchists , both in what they do , nor what they want , now how they act . 
  as , from what i have seen at such events as a neutral bystander , the danger to public safety usually comes from the side of the antifa , that actually is sound policy . 
   ** manchester united ** player provides unmitigated joy for a good fraction of their ** 659 million fans ** citaton needed, 
  so , french clubs now pay their players 400 % what they paid them before . 
  which will of course be put on the shoulders of fans ( by tickets , merchandise ) and non-fans ( by increased tv fees ) . 
  everyone looses , again . 
   because she is also sacrificing long-term stability in the region ? 
  or because people have the right to self-determination ? 
  and that suits her political self-preservation ... how ? 
   what tangible effect does this ability to `` bail out greece '' have for the lives of greek people ? 
  have a read about the political and security situation of argentinia in the 1990s and we talk again . 
   so , if some greater power decided that the german economy was immoral then they 'd have the right to nuke you from orbit ? 
  difference : the german economy works . 
   first , it will lose direct access to the markets of all the eurozone countries . 
  obviously , the german economy did not exist pre-2002 . 
  til . 
   second , it will lose the ability to be compensated for its exports in something that is valuable to them . 
  answer : we go back to the system we had before . 
  we will accept gold . 
  actually , the eu is a circlejerk , and they have been masturbating for much , much longer .
