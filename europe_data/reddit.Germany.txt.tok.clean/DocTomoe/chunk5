   i am not part of any propaganda team . 
  i speak my opinions and you are free to speak yours . 
  i have zero intention of silencing you . 
  given how you do make me feel stalked and how you seem to be on this topic 24/7 , you would make a great addition to your country 's propaganda team . 
   you though are constantly looking for ways to make people leave and censor them . 
  do i ? 
  actually , i consider myself more a counterweight in these discussions . 
  i do n't want historians in fifty years claim that `` resistance to the warmongers was non-existant '' . 
   it is n't peace loving to watch a country get fucked and be more worried about your own hide . 
  peace , sir , is the absence of war . 
  currently , there is an absence of war within the borders of eu member states . 
  a situation a lot of the people around here want to change . 
   you would sell out poland just as fast as you would ukraine . 
  what is your fascination with poland , i wonder ? 
  those do look even more inviting . 
  wants me punch in next years vacation already . 
  i did not even think of bears , though now that you mention them ... yeah , those are probably the most dangerous aspects down there . 
  what i actually meant to say is : how is the crime situation in these areas ? 
  do i have to expect being robbed ? 
  so , how safe is romania/transylvania for trekking ? 
   what do you mean `` this is n't the us '' ? 
  it is a worldwide website based in the usa . 
  / r/murica is over there . 
   what is your next comment , if you are a woman or old shut the fuck up since you wo n't be on the front lines ? 
  might as well take the vote away from them too . 
  actually , as you might have learned from my countries history , we have no issues putting women , old people , crippled and wounded , `` medically-discharged '' and children in uniform if we need to , unlike you . 
   sounds like you are just annoyed at what you thought was a clever jab not working my point still stands . 
  from the safety of your home , you are willing to send people to do the dying for you while you hide behind your `` medical discharge '' , and then have the audacity of claiming people who are more peaceloving than you are `` sellouts '' . 
  and when someone points out that / r/europes pentagon/ukrainian propaganda squad might graciously pick up their weapons and do their fighting themselves , you get annoyed , because that would take away from superbowl sundays and internet access . 
  and you think your `` i 'm too sick to go to war '' line will give you any brownie points ? 
  this is n't the us , and you are not considered a hero just for once having showed up . 
  last time i checked , there was no war within the borders of the eu . 
   yes , that absolutely represents hundreds of military personnel in usa and also the rest of nato as well . 
  that represents pretty much any military unit . 
  war dehumanizes , and dehumanized soldiers will get their frustrations out in bad ways . 
  by the way , as you are one of the warmongers in / r/europe as well : are you enlisted ? 
  you will be trained in to answer to such scenarios in boot camp . 
  til . 
  it 's happening in pretty much any war on pretty much any side , yes , [ even with `` professional '' armies like the us ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/abu-ghraib-leash.jpg ) . 
  edit : added image , lest we forget . 
  yeah , because the us has such a great track record in terrorism prevention . 
  actually , a major terrorist attack on an european capital imho is the best that could happen to us right now . 
  it would finally tke away our attention from the ukraine war . 
  so , if you want war , why are you not yet in your country 's recruitment office ? 
  or is it only cool if someone else does the murdering , raping and dying ? 
  disregard this message if you are in your country 's military or military reserve . 
   europe has surely learned by now not to attack russia in the winter . 
  oh , well , third time is a charm . 
   mistrals be among the most up-to-date pieces of equipment in the russian army ? 
  i 'd wager the russians would n't use them in their * army * but their * navy * . 
  which at the current point in time is not majorly involved in the east-ukrainian theatre . 
  well , it obviously is a town without a name ... which could make pre-war/now satellite picture comparison easier . 
  [ sorry , i could n't convince myself not to post this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or6mo5rfsz4#t=4m27s ) laugh , it 's german humor . 
  seriously , your stuff looks delicious . 
  the article is written by a greek national living in greece . 
  it is somewhat believable . 
  that 's source enough for anyone . 
  demanding `` sources '' for editorials like they were some scientific study is a common tactic of antipropaganda . 
  just saying . 
   not that hard to do if your ass is also so far away from russia . 
  actually , the [ us does share a border with russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ussr%e2%80%93usa_maritime_boundary_agreement ) . 
  i still wonder how much of it is ukrainian-led propaganda effort and how much is armchair generals ' insanity . 
  i honestly could n't tell . 
  / r/europe is fully in hysteria mode . 
  and you do believe that russia just will take the sanctions like a little bitch . 
  you might want to read about the stuff that led to pearl harbor . 
  it seems someone in the us administration has a cooler head than most people here . 
  you ca n't slip out of war crimes accusal by claiming you never * declared * war . 
  well , then the rest of you can go to war , because that 's what this is comming down to - if you can manage to find a theatre of operations that 's not * our * parking plot . 
  do n't expect * us * to pick up your rebuilding tab caused by your collective insanity , though . 
   on face value , few of the licences read like they matter much to the kremlin 's military machine , with its $ 81bn annual budget . 
  during the past 12 months , for example , the uk granted the export of # 480 worth of semiconductor chemicals , and # 6,261 of swimming equipment . 
  yeah , that 's pretty useless for slaughtering ukrainian freedom fighters . 
  of course , it 's equally useless as the german battle simulator we * decided * not to sell after all , even after it got greenlit . 
  point is : we do n't do business with them when it comes to military applications . 
  the uk ( and , for that matter , france , who sells entire warships ) does . 
  but * we 're * only concerned with our gdp . 
  you do have my sympathies . 
  kaufland is a soulcrushing place . 
  i 'm glad i can mostly avoid them . 
  only that the article very clearly states the opposing force tried taking them prisoner , not kill them . 
  standing up from behind cover with hands in the air internationally is recognized as a sign of surrender . 
  it developed from raising muskets butt-first into the air ( thus : unable to fire ) at least since the hessian wars ^ 1 . 
  hands in the air is a sign that you are not holding a weapon . 
  holding a disguised weapon in such a manner would be considered a war crime . 
  the circumstances ( massively overpowered foe ) and the fact that the opposing force did close in with no cover being taken when the ukrainian forces raised their hands , it 's pretty obvious this was not some kind of military maneuver , but an act of perfidy . 
  [ 1 ] the white flag as a sign of surrender came from the time where you raised your opponent 's flag as a sign of surrender . 
  as the french royal flag was white , units surrendering to the french raised the `` white flag '' . 
  different layers of `` trustworthyness '' . 
  you can be reliable and still prepare to have a nice short trip through polish territory . 
  fear of the evil nazi still is strong in poland . 
  well , as opposed to britain , * we * stopped our weapons exports to russia . 
  i guess * not * selling somehow strengthens our economy . 
  in fact , it did n't happen in most conflicts post - ' 45 . 
  the [ few examples ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_war#declared_wars_since_1945 ) which did you can count on two hands . 
  and this is why the eu will not in the forseeable future have a common foreign policy : you ca n't have one side of us trying to calm a situation with diplomacy and have their insane neighbors rattle their sabers like that all the time . 
  it does send mixed signals . 
  actually , no . 
  the un is a supranational treaty organization and exists because nations signed that treaty . 
  if you scale it down , e.g.
