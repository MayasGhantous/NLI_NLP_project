  why ? 
  the benefits what you gain from first gas attack is lost because enemy will use gas attacks later to you . 
  actually , there were [ gas attacks in ww2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_warfare#world_war_ii ) , only mostly none in the european theatre . 
  fewer than 300 warheads in the 100-300kt range . 
  [ that 's going to hurt , but is survivable ] ( http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;kt=300&amp;lat=52.516306&amp;lng=13.377218&amp;airburst=0&amp;hob_ft=0&amp;zm=12 ) . 
  practically speaking , a strongly-worded letter is assistance . 
  a nato-russian war by definition would be nuclear . 
  your question has invalid options . 
  well , i 'd rather have ww3 with nukes and fallout ten years from now rather than right now , thank you very much . 
   sorry , but france 's army is bigger , more experienced and better equipped ... france is the stronger neighbour right now , military wise . 
  just like it was in 1940 . 
  let them have it . 
  `` to maintain the security of the north atlantic area '' . 
   ** g\u00f6ring ** : why , of course , the people do n't want war . 
  why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece ? 
  naturally , the common people do n't want war ; neither in russia nor in england nor in america , nor for that matter in germany . 
  that is understood . 
  but , after all , it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship . 
    ** gilbert ** : there is one difference . 
  in a democracy , the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives , and in the united states only congress can declare wars . 
    ** g\u00f6ring ** : oh , that is all well and good , but , voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders . 
  that is easy . 
  all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger . 
  it works the same way in any country . 
  in an interview with gilbert in g\u00f6ring 's jail cell during the nuremberg war crimes trials ( 18 april 1946 ), 
  read article 5 correctly . 
   will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action *** as it deems necessary *** , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
  i highlighted the important part to you . 
  i can conceive actions that we could deem necessary which does not involve our military hardware being involved . 
   hmm . 
  it also means that we are useless when it comes to our own defense . 
  i am sure we can handle luxembourg should they go rouge . 
  or france . 
  and noone can handle rusisa , not even nato , without most of us being dead anyways . 
   surprinsingly less than japan by a few billion dollars . 
  japan mostly spends in naval developments because of their geostrategic position , and naval projects are expensive . 
  they also have a plausible threat scenario right at their doorsteps . 
  those actually are americans . 
  and some british . 
  the polish attack plan : 1 . 
  go to germany 2 . 
  steal tanks instead of cars 3 . 
  and their fees towards local merchants , which in turn will raise the prices . 
  in the end , the end customer pays the taxes . 
  you are aware amazon actually sells stuff other than books ? 
  also , why is everyone here so eager to give their money to the state ? 
  the tax money from bookstores now lost has not been paid by the bookstores , but by * you * . 
  people having jobs is better than people dying . 
  well , speak for yourself , then . 
  i prefer to decide what my money works for myself instead flowing into the public service of murdering people in the middle east . 
  sure . 
  and now , amazon will have to raise prices . 
  so you are n't just paying the tax , you also will pay * their * tax . 
  did you think they just pocket the extra cost ? 
  false headline . 
  amazon 's customers are going to start paying more eu taxes . 
  that 's you , me , everyone . 
  yay . 
  heh , germans make fun of mecklenburg-vorpommern because `` noone lives there , and those who do n't best get lost anyways '' . 
  then i took a look at the baltics - or spain . 
  seriously , now i imagine those places like a fallout-3-esque wasteland . 
   unless your are profiting from your grandfather 's action that that 's why we got a statute of limitations - to cause a state of peace under the law . 
   we enjoy cheap goods , certain resources and we thrive on the wealth erected upon the shoulders of exploited people in developing countries . 
  and yet , here you sit on a highly-developed machine created by the work of child slaves who scratched the precious metals needed in it 's creation out of the earth with their little hands . 
  why do n't you sell this product of injustice , and everything else you own , and give it to those poor oppressed peoples ? 
   if you buy stuff at the discounter , it 's your sin , not your grandfather 's . 
  hahahaha , yeah , right . 
  you grow your food yourself , right ? 
  just because my grandfather did something to your grandfather does not give you a legal right to act against me . 
   ( hey , look at us , we can do all this crap and get away with it , hue hue ) . 
  aka : what superpowers do . 
  and those who have been demoted to `` great powers '', 
  the president should take responsibility for the actions of his staff . 
  what you see here is poe 's law at work . 
   those demands may have been coming from the german presidents wife , who also attended the commemoration . 
  german presidents have been forced to step down for less . 
  and i never liked gauck anyways . 
  too bad merkel ca n't afford to lose yet another president . 
  there 's this thing we like . 
  we call it ` austerity ' - aka . 
  fiscal responsibility . 
  you may have heard about it . 
  edit : to all 28 of you who decided on the downvote : woooosh . 
  and a rather bad one at that . 
  i mean ... they got actually edible food . 
  well , it 's far from stellar either . 
  and i guess after this week , they 're going to drop some more places . 
  ahem ... remember 11.9 . ? 
  11.9.1973 , i mean , when the us supported fascist dictator pinochet to overthrow democratically-elected socialist allende in chile - and in thus , the murder of thousands of political rivals by their new puppet . 
  he was considered to be the `` pro-west '' person . 
  that 's pretty much the history behind any putsch since 1945 . 
  to say it with volker pispers : '' ... and then we choose ourselves a nice , dynamic young dictator ... '', 
  is it ? 
  is n't that pretty much the executive summary to every war , ever ? 
  well , then maybe they should n't live in what obviously is a bad neighborhood . 
  also , the dutch . 
  they practically are germans with a weird dialect . 
   seems a bit excessive to me ? 
  given they planned an airport without adequate fire-warning systems ... yes . 
  how do you explain these things to a belgian ... ok .
