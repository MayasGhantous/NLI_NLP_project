  no , because the vast majority of / r/europe wants to go to war . 
  because it appears repeating the same mistakes over and over again does n't make the next generation any brighter . 
  and if you want war , you need to be pumped up . 
  well , maybe they should be conceived and born with [ `` the spirit of ' 43 '' ] ( https://archive.org/details/thespiritof43_56 ) playing in the background . 
  or maybe '' [ the new spirit ] ( http://www.popmodal.com/video/18890/pay-your-income-tax-1943-disney-propoganda ) '' . 
  would save us some troubles . 
  none of these movies is exactly kids-friendly . well , maybe star-wars , and even that one is n't for `` young '' children . 
  youth camps . 
  seriously , guys , keeping out some words is completely misleading and clickbait . 
  norway builds `` secret '' base 2 . 
  norway sells it for a steal over the internet 3 . 
  new owner allows civilian russian research ships to dock there . 
  because they fly a russian flag instead of , say , a liberian one , everyone goes apeshit ? 
  seriously , maybe we should calm down a bit . 
   for instance doctors can overrule the objection of certain religious groups that refuse blood transfusions when it comes to their children . 
  is that a british thing ? 
  i am pretty sure in germany , they can not . 
  again , i am not against vacciniations . 
  they are useful . 
  i am against making them mandatory by law - given there * is * the - albight slight - possibility of permanent damages by vacs , making them mandatory is the equivalent of forcing a parent to play russian roulette with ther child 's head . 
  it goes well most of the time - until it does n't . 
  also , i do fear that once you make * one * medical procedure mandatory , eventually , * other * , maybe more risky , medical procedures will become mandatory as well . 
  ah , `` a threat to the common good '' . 
  if we one day find out that - let 's pick something random and outrageous - red-haired folks are a hundred times as likely to be unaffected transmitters of the hi virus , should we all castrate them , for the better good ? 
  i respectfully disagree - for the simple reason that mandatory anything usually starts to grow from very strictly defined to increasingly more cases . 
  just need to give my italian friend some perspective before he gets his nuclear boner . 
  and it is . 
  if only having guns is a crime , only criminals will have guns . 
  if russia decides to use nukes on the us for interference ( as in parking part of their navy in the black sea , or parking a division or two in the baltics ) , the us will retaliate unilaterally . 
  there will afterwards be no need for nato to get involved ( and no nato , either ) . 
  i am not an anti-vaccer ... 
  i got all my shots , and i think anti-vaccers are stupid . 
  still ... 
  headlines like that give me the chills . 
  do we really want to live in a system where there are mandatory medical procedures ? 
  til : one slavic female surname . 
  i am aware of that . 
  i just pointed out that the spd has a long history of being turncoats , and the phrase is as valid today as it was in 1918 . 
  if hitler used it in his propaganda ( which i doubt ) , well , even a broken clock it right twice a day . 
  for those who do not understand this ... 
  it 's a reference to the license plate `` h982 fkl '' of a car clarkson from top gear drove ** in argentina ** , obviously to piss off the locals - it could be understood as '' ** f ** al ** kl ** and ( 1 ) 982 '' . 
  of course , they later claimed it was merely coincidental . 
  [ have a link with a photo of said car ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2886973/of-course-meant-journalist-noted-gear-controversial-h982-fkl-number-plate-slams-idea-accident-says-no-one-think-casual-thing.html ) . 
   how would a german like mayotte ? 
  you mean [ this place ] ( https://www.diveand.travel/images/inf000169_indischer_ozean_mayotte_01.jpg ) ? 
  very nice !, 
  but then , i 'd prefer papeete . 
  i 'm more a pacific kind of person . 
  yeah , because hartz4 , the first vorratsdatenspeicherung and the kurnaz case ( amongst other things ) are examples of something the pre-hitler weimar republic did . 
  `` die da oben '' = ` those up there ' = any level of government . 
  you got my heartfelt sympathy . 
  should you ever come to southern germany , give me a poke so i can go and have a beer with you . 
   school psychologist halina wysocka said : `` children are not emotionally mature enough to experience prayer during which the holy spirit may enter them . '', 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; implying that she does believe adults are mature enough so the holy spirit , ** which she accepts as an actually existing force of nature ** , can enter them . 
  is there seriously any question about these kind of things in the polish public ? 
  ( edit : changed pronouns ), 
   that 's all true . 
  but the 4 year old thing really is crucial . 
  especially in dutch . 
  that language barely has any rules so it mostly comes down to intuition . 
  so set up mandatory preschool . 
  even though i do n't think dutch can be that difficult . 
  seriously ? 
  has it been increased in the last few years ? 
  last time i saw figures , bbc fees sempt lower . 
  are you an influental us state department employee deciding which of these potential pms gets us support and monies ? 
  because then , i would think that is slightly problematic . 
   the point was smart people ca n't live up to their potential because of language issues . 
  then they should focus on the language first . 
   i mean my english is pretty good but it will never be as good as the english that natives speak . 
  are you sure ? 
  the [ cpe ] ( http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams/proficiency/ ) is n't that hard , and certifies a c2-level use of the english language . 
  it 's mostly done by people who started learning english long after their fourth birthday . 
  will you be able to know * everything * ? 
  there 's always dialects and insider jokes . 
  but then , academically-speaking , your english will likely be * better * than most of the native speakers - mostly because most native speakers do not use their language in an academic setting . 
  your point being ? 
  if they want to excel academically in the netherlands , that would be a good idea , do n't you agree ? 
   they spoke the language well enough to understand everything said but not well enough to put their thoughts into words on tests properly . 
  well , then obviously they are not fluent . 
  language skills are about communication , and communication means expressing ones own ideas . 
  remember [ victoria `` fuck the eu '' nuland ] ( https://youtu.be/2qxz8t3v_bk ) , which handpicked new ukrainian `` leaders '' while the euromaidan just started up ? 
  or that nice [ i am an ukrainian ] ( https://youtu.be/hvds2aiiwla ) video that was created using support from larry diamond , a member of the council on foreign relations ? 
  yeah , * i * 'm the conspiracy nut . 
   they spoke dutch fluently but it was still not good enough for them to get the grades they deserved . 
  this sentence does not make sense . 
  either they were fluent , which ( in this context ) means they were able to understand the vast majority of it and able to look up the more esoteric stuff , or they were not ( and then they got the grades they earned ) . 
  just because you are able to communicate in a language somewhat does not mean you deserve to be a straight-a student with no extra effort . 
  we are talking immigrants here , not refugees . 
  and yes , immigrants should take language courses . 
  after all , we do not want the unskilled traditionalist backcountry farmer , we want the somewhat-educated city-dweller ( which also is less likely to be a religious extremist ), 
  ... or we could only let people into our countries who have at least a b1 level of language skills - with a c1-level after five years ( or they are asked to leave ) . 
  hell , i 'm even willing to throw in a citizenship . 
  a russian would now likely say that there is not that much a difference . 
  ... says the kievan troll who posts a six-month old non-story . 
  yep ... so who is to blame they have worse chances ? 
  the evil state , or their own modus operandi ? 
  yeah , but then the british could watch german tv ^ 1 without paying our ( considerably higher ) license fees . 
  [ 1 ] not that anyone would want that .
