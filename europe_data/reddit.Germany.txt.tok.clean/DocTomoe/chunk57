   this whole bloody mess in ukraine started only because putin perceived the west as corrupt , divided , and weak . 
  after the failed angloeuropean coup in kiev ( also known as `` euromaidan '' ) , i would say he is spot-on . 
  so , how is your civil war going again ? 
  yep ... still , an hour for finding out the `` solutions '' are the same old bullshit is hell of an investment . 
  it is the duty of the immigrant to learn the language of the land . 
  interestingly , this only seems to be a problem with turkish/arabian immigrants - the second-generation vietnamese immigrants i know are all fluent . 
  i 'm anything but pc , though . 
   you really think such an incident would a war to break if it actually were an accident ? 
  yes . 
  this is n't india and pakistan , ca . 
   there are enough precedents for skirmishes at times of peace that did not spark a war , and there are plenty of skirmishes in times of peace that intentionally sparked a war . 
  and then you have the wars that have started in a skirmish , but noone ever admitted it . 
  we would never know who fired the first shot . 
   neither of them will let some random retards dictate their foreign policy . 
  your words in god 's ear canal . 
   and you do n't need to have the intention of starting a war if you want to be ready for war . 
  war is peace , freedom is slavery , we 've always been at war with oceania , huh ? 
  the existance and presence of troops is always demonstrated intent to engage in warfare , much like owning a car is intent to drive around in it . 
  `` hello applicant , please fill in this form . 
  oh , i see you are just black ? 
  sorry , all the black spots are filled , so you do n't get the job '' . 
  positive discrimination is just discrimination . 
  whoever thinks of that as positive is either benefitting from it or brainwashed . 
   it would be a good idea to have more specialized educational offers for the needs of recent immigrants . 
  i do find this idea , which insinuates that immigrants are in some way more stupid or unable to compete on the existing , level playing field , to be inheriently racist . 
  one fucking hour . 
  are the solutions `` hey , just pay all our debts and then some , and we 're going to be great ? '', 
  buildup to ww3 . 
  actually , two years ago , i would have considered that a nutjob idea . 
  right now , i fear i might be correct . 
  i hope when you die hit by some sniper sometime next year , you will remember typing this , and realize how foolish you were . 
  never in the history of war has the presence of opposing troops made a situation safer . 
  there is no state of war ... yet . 
  but when us troops * parade * 200 meters from the russian border , all it takes to start a war is a young russian private loosing his cool when he sees an apc approach . 
   and it 's not done in with the intention of provoking one . 
  and this is where our opinions differ from each other - the guys in washington are too bright to do this if they were n't willing to start a war . 
  actually , i was not particularily talking about greece here ... there were a lot of countries which wanted their turn . 
   you suggested it by adding `` peace is the exception '' . 
  you are aware that `` peace '' is more than the absence of war , right ? 
  not having much hills and wide green belts actually does play a role in this . 
  you ca n't do this in nyc . 
  or stuttgart , for that matter ( munich i could imagine ), 
  that 's really convinient timing ... no , it 's not a political decision at all . 
  after all , now that we got us troops with loaded assault rifles at our borders with russia , polan stronk . 
  new tricks being `` just turn over and relax your economic muscle '' ? 
   those are people welcoming american troops , a token which shows that usa is serious about its promises . 
  aka . 
  `` mobilized american troops marching to war '' . 
   the presence of american troops ensure peace . 
  the sad thing is that people actually believe this . 
  back in 1914 , they did not cheer for war either - they cheered for `` a demonstration of strength '' = `` security '' . 
  please kindly keep your warmongering to yourself . 
  i think you mistake san marino with the vatican, 
  there 's actually an [ wikipedia article about this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_see_and_the_united_nations ) . 
  in short : they are n't a member , so they do n't get to vote . 
  no real scotsman , huh ? 
  hahahaha ... yeah , great . 
  given there is an ongoing attack against any network at any given point in time we now can call article 5 at will , huh ? 
  note how article 5 specifically talks about * armed attacks against territory or flagbearing vessels * . 
  cyber is very obviously not an armed attack against territory or flagbearing vessels . 
  well , similar to pictures and threads currently on the / r/europe front page , like * [ this one about poland ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30pjfl/meanwhile_in_poland/ ) or * [ this one about the czech republic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30p7zk/meanwhile_in_czech_republic/ ) or * [ this one about lithuania ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30qkye/meanwhile_in_lithuania/ ) history repeating , all over again . 
  look , northern holstein is spawking up again , 
   i would prefer `` the empire '' . 
  which we would promptly translate to `` das reich '' . 
  yep , great idea . 
  let 's move forward . 
  we could even call it the fourth ( following three former reichs ) . 
   ~ ~ bribe ~ ~ gift `` consultation fees '' . 
  ftfy, 
  yep , because / r/europe * hates * bankers and fund managers and consider anything they demand to be horrific , unless they demand european federalization . 
  should n't the common-sense approach be `` hey , usually these guys have bad ideas , so let 's rethink this idea for a while '' ? 
  lowest common denominator of `` humor '' for hipsters . 
  tries to imitate stefan raab - who has done this kind of thing more professionally and funnier since ... 1999 ? 
  starts witch-hunts against photographers who try to protect their copyrights . 
  and then we wonder why everyone thinks we 're bad at humor . 
  i think / r/trees might be involved . 
  montana . 
  great scenery . 
  clean water . 
  reasonable weapons laws . 
  reasonable building codes . 
  very few people . 
   edit : great to downvote somebody who simply ask for peace and tells you that humans are dying . 
  you are surprised that / r/europe , which has morphed to warmongers central in the last year , is anti-peace ? 
   here in australia nazism is the thing people know most about germany . 
  well , you have to have * some * stereotypes . 
  for instance , anything relating to australia is about kangaroos and steve irving here . 
  it was highly unpopular both with the political caste as well as the population . 
  the euro was france 's demand to accept the reunification to dearm the `` german a-bomb '' - the d-mark . 
  then we understood how we could use the new situation to our advantage . 
  evil us . 
  reading / r/europe for the last year made me think otherwise . 
  so your argument that a conflict is not settled as long as anyone having benefitted from it ins still alive ? 
  well , there are people alive today that only are alive because of the persian war . 
  ww2 was 70 years ago . 
  ever since , germans happily have accepted the blame , and we have picked up the check book again , and again , and again . 
  we even abolished a perfectly good currency to start the euro for reunification , which is a direct result of ww2 , and we essentially rebuilt our country twice when everyone else rebuilt theirs once . 
  one day , there must be peace , and one day , the world needs to understand we have bled enough . 
  there is rising public opinion that that point is long overdue . 
  differently from the 1970s , when we just rolled with the punches , today , we got presidents who claim `` national itnterests '' that need to be protected by means of force , if necessary - we start to develop a sense of relative power again .
