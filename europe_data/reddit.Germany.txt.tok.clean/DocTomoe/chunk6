  to the [ west nordic council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_nordic_council ) you will see it 's international recognition is irrelevant for it existing . 
  noone cares if bhutan formally legitimized a supranational entity to exist . 
  we all know ukraine is in a civil war in which the opposing forces are supported by russia logistically . 
  in civil wars , the hauge conventions do apply . 
  what russia calls it is irrelevant . 
  remember how the korean war was called a `` police action '' - did n't make the war crimes happening there ( by either involved party ) any less warcrimey . 
  actually , the `` other countries recognizing something '' litmus test pretty much only applies to statehood . 
  according to the un resolution , offensive wars without the agreement of the security council are by definition illegal . 
  as the ukrainian media ( = the ukrainian state ) obviously endorses a war crime , it could not be the dead suicide-bombers , but the ukrainian leadership which could face the hauge tribunal . 
  of course , given that they 're `` the good guys '' , that wo n't happen . 
  but by the letter of the law , it should . 
  the opposing forces closed in in an obviously very uncovered way - which hints at the weapon in question not visible at least . 
  i do n't think that this exception will match . 
  mandatory pointer to this [ not exactly being a new thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) . 
  but then , the us * is * giving them an easy target . 
  it 's safe to express such ideas if you 're an absolutist micronation that 's not in the eu , and even in the worst case you would have to take in freaking * two * guys . 
   the injured ukrainian officers stood up with their hands up . 
  signalling surrender in an internationally accepted way . 
   notably , they held things in their hands , and a moment later there were several powerful blasts like grenade explosions . 
  yay for the war crime of [ perfidy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfidy ), 
  just to illustrate how the pictures that are published look to me : [ look at this russian t-72 , from a rare subversion that only exists in russia , crushing innocent ukrainian children right in the middle of the euromaidan ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qnf0x0rzgwa/tfhfk6fjy8i/aaaaaaaaane/sezx1m-uofs/s1600/t-72b_with_kontakt_era_reactive_armour_ukraine_ukrainian_defence_industry_military_technology_640.jpg ) the other day , there even was one of the usual `` russian tank column in the ukraine '' article here , showing the picture of an * ukrainian * tank column for illustration ( they admitted it , and the flags were hardly hidden , but seriously , wtf ? ), 
  i do trust pictures that show definite proof of where they were taken . 
  put a landmark somewhere in the background , and it becomes believable . 
  the mere image of a tank in front of a tree or on some random road without definite roadsigns is meaningless . 
  also , it would help if said image was part of a series of images from different angles , or a small animated sequence - as they 're less easy to forge . 
  well , no . 
  but i would be wary when you would claim there were doctors in your country and show me pictures of random people wearing white coats in nondescript woods . 
  some call it the lhc . 
  other 's call it a thinly-veiled [ doomsday device ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doomsday_device ) . 
  we could put them in flecktarn and send them to ukraine to help . 
  that would imply there actually * are * russian tanks in the ukraine ( all we have seen up to now are photos of tanks , that could have been taken anywhere ), 
  i think netherlands ( and others ) helped because they did not want nato to get put to a test . 
   you are the one saying nato does n't mean germany had to actually help poland read the fucking treaty . 
  `` take action as they deem necessary '' . 
  if we deem necessary to get a bag of popcorn and watch warsaw - or , for that matter , dc - burn , and we do that , we technically hae fulfilled the treaty . 
  there is no automatic `` you have to send troops into a fighting war '' clause in the north atlantic treaty . 
  we are no slaves to the pentagon . 
   you do n't think poland is important anyway and is actually a rival . 
  militarily speaking , in a shit hits the fan scenario , it 's only importance is being a buffer zone . 
  and of course it is a rival . 
  so is pretty much any other country in the world ( remember : germany nowadays defines itself by economic output , not military strength ), 
  turkey played with the idea to ask nato to help , then got told in no uncertain terms such a request would be unwise . 
   and syria never went to war against turkey . 
  the north atlantic treaty does not speak about war , it speaks about `` attacks '' . 
  which also mean stray shells or shooting down fighter jets . 
  falkland islands , where the british elected to handle it themselves , instead of summoning nato . 
  the falkland isles are not north of the tropic of cancer last time i checked , so nato was not responsible anyway . 
  well , turkey got attacked by syria two years ago , and nato did nothing ( what was done was bilaterally ) . 
  nato still exists , thus your outlook is wrong to begin with . 
  your second paragraph works on the unprooven premise that nato is being taken seriously today . 
  you seem to have made a hobby of twisting words . 
  i said any attempt in a fictious poland-is-invaded-by-russia scenario would be futile and thus would n't happen to focus on more important tasks at hand , like getting prepared when the red army comes knocking at our doors . 
   defending a country with a military appliance is n't letting them rot as a convenient safety buffer . 
  if russia was as insane as to invade poland ( unlikely ) , it is pretty clear they wo n't stop once they 've got it . 
  defending poland then is not a priority . 
  btw : that was nato strategy during the cold war : using germany as a safety buffer for france and britain to prepare . 
  but i guess if the us does it , it 's awright . 
  i 'm not flipflopping . 
  in an russia-invades-poland scenario , we need a few days to get into full battle mode . 
  by then , poland will be lost anyway . 
  we 're not in high-alert mode , mostly because there 's no reasonable threat . 
   on what planet does it exist that the less you spend on military the higher the quality it is ? 
  i did not claim it was automatic . 
  i did claim spending based on gdp is meaningless . 
  of course you can buy shit with little money as well . 
  but then , there is a reason why we are one of the largest weapons exporters in the world : we 're known not to manufacture shit ; we only have problems with shit military goods when we import them ( currently eurohawk , also prominently and not forgotten is the f104g debacle )  i am actually fine with germany having a weak military anyway being considered weak is an advantage . 
  read some sun tzu , and some clausewitz . 
  oh , a cheap joke about the not exactly native-speaker language proficiency . 
  i hope i made your day in a life of mediocrity better . 
  anyone else who read that probably has understood my meaning . 
  so , instead of 10 * 1x , i spend 1 * 5x ( which still is less than 10x ) . 
  now i 'm under the 2 % gdp mark , essentially being inviolation of what the us thinks is healthy . 
   it depends on the `` something '' you do . 
  just because you do n't like the kind of leadership we take does not mean you can start fearmongering against us . 
  personally , i prefer the tunnel variant ... noone wants to drive over a bering strait bridge when there 's a storm :p estimated time of project completion : late 2311 . 
   look how well iraq did with quantity . 
  iraq is a * wonderful * example on how the 2 % mark is meaningless : [ their spending is way over the 2 % mark ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs/countries/iq?display=graph ) , and still , their quality is so bad that they run from a handful of isis terrorists . 
  now , had they invested 1.5 % in * quality * training and equipment , they might not have that problem anymore . 
   nato requires self defense to ensure the protection of a country 's borders . 
  note : self-defense !, 
  not attack wars as foreign legions for washington . 
  1.4 % is plenty for self-defense . 
   if there is an invading force , defenders are deemed necessary . 
  under certain circumstances , yes . 
  but then , there are factors such as `` projected loss of life '' that could make defending one 's territory a bad deal and capitulation an option . 
  well , i guess we 're the only ones qualified to do so - maybe because we 're the only ones not already fuelling their bombers . 
  let 's have a look at this glorified table , shall we ? 
   they are the united states , greece ( 2.5 % ) , united kingdom ( 2.5 % ) , france ( 2.3 % ) and turkey ( 2.3 % ) . 
  the us is drunk with it 's military and uses it not unlike prussia did in the 19th century - as a continuation of diplomacy with other means . 
  they need large spending to be able to wage offensive wars world-wide . 
  this is not something we should cheer for . 
  the uk is over the 2 % mark because they 're currently upgrading their fleet - few expeditures , but large in individual size ( see [ the historical chart ] ( http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_2005_2018ukb_30t ) ) . 
  greece and turkey do not increase their military spending to support nato , but to be ready should their eternal rival ( turkey or greece ) decide to come to a visit . 
  in fact , these two countries are the most likely nato members to start a shooting war against each other . 
  this policy is one of the many reasons why greece went belly-up , btw . 
   estonia and poland are close to the 2 % level -- at 1.9 % each . 
  estonia and poland have relatively small economies , and tanks do n't magically get cheaper when you 're poor . 
   germany spends just 1.4 % of its gdp on defense . 
  which is quite enough . 
  it supports a standing army with relatively new equipment , well able to enforce our international commitments .
