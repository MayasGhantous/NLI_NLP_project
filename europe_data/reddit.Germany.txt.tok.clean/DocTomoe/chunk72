  hahaha , sure . 
  you got a link to such a landesgesetz , right ? 
   landkreis ostalg\u00e4u has 102 police men in total and they are responsible for an area of 1.395,09 km \u00b2 . 
  most of it inaccessible forests , mountains and uninteresting farmland on which noone would start a riot . 
   within a few minutes obviously , you are delusional . 
  noone ever claimed they 'd be that quick . 
  usually , illegitime protests do n't just vanish within a few seconds , either , so it 's still enough time for the nightstick to come out . 
   add 30 min preparation time and time to find a spot to land , it easily takes an helicopter 60 min to get here . 
  i already took prep time into account . 
  if you think it takes the sek 30 minutes to gather , you have the wrong idea about what they actually are . 
  also , schwangau is close enough to the border for bundespolizei being around . 
   there was a big fire here a couple of years ago and it took reeinforcment 2 hours to get here and they hurried the fuck up . 
  `` there was this one event which i took a personal interest in which the police did not think was as important than i do , so the police must be massively understaffed '' that being said : when there 's a big fire in * my * town , i call the fire station , not the police . 
   you think farmers announce their protest when they block the road and empty out wine transporters ? 
  they should , or riot police . 
  and , in fact , in germany , they do . 
   except that it is happening regulary everyone knows that saxony police is essentially a right-wing organization . 
  try staging an antifa gig , and see how many people they can gather , quickly . 
   it was not the firce case of this happening in cologne only that * that * is an example of a major police force sucessfully regaining peace and order through massive show of force . 
   long response time even in severe cases are not unusual . 
  the article title ends with a question mark . 
  [ betteridge 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge's_law_of_headlines ) applies . 
  20 minutes is n't so bad , actually . 
  also , the police itself gives figures of 6 and 9 minutes . 
  of course , people in emergencies tend to overestimate response times . 
   in case of a school shooting , the nearest gsg unit is in munich , which is about an 45 min away with helicopter 1 . 
  in case of a school shooting , it 's not the gsg which is called . 
  2 . the bell `` huey '' 1h , which is used by the gsg , has an air speed of 217 km/h - 45 minutes would point you around 150 klicks away from munich , if you take some prep time into account . 
  so you 're either near passau - which has a sizeable police presence , or n\u00fcrnberg , which too has a lot of police , or ansbach , also full of the men in green , or very close to the german border , which means bundespolizei . 
  honestly , i think you have no idea what you are talking about . 
   and the police is not coming by helicopter for a farmers protest . 
  protests are announced , giving the police a chance to prepare , or they are riots - then it 's riot police time . 
   they severly lacked manpower yes , in that very specific situation on a date that has both lower manpower ** and ** simultaneous events happening everywhere . 
  think like this : usually , there are enough doctors for everyone , but if a large-scale manu happens , there might be a manpower shortage . 
   i lived in a small village in bavaria and if anythign serious happened ( like an heavy accident ) it took the reeinforcment of the police over an hour from the next bigger town . 
  that 's just for unimportant stuff like heavy accidents . 
  be assured they 're a lot quicker if someone brought a gun to their school . 
   even in cologne on new years eve they did not have enough police sure they had , they just planned horribly . 
   it took over five hours for reeinforcment to arrive . 
  it 's a bit hard to get hold of people on new year 's eve - the bereitschaft is shut down mostly , the officers on leave are drunk , and there 's new year 's eve situations literally * everywhere * ... 
  the question should be : how can it be that there were only 6 policemen ? 
  in germany , they 'd call in reinforcements , and they 'd have a hundred swat guys there in half an hour . 
  you mean , by drinking french wine , one supports terrorism ? 
  alright , let 's switch habits . 
  but then , of course , instead of bringing out the stick ( thus * increasing * violence against public servants ) , they could just start to treat citizens as human beings instead as * untertanen * ... 
  a perfect example of what happens to mud-shovelers : they only get depressing thoughts , downvote and suffer from pain , thus they groan all the time . 
  at least , misery loves company , and they get an upvote or two . 
  we consider comparing ourselves to those lower to be a strategic failure . 
  reach for the stars , do n't shovel in the mud . 
  i do not think that merkel , or other european leaders , for that matter , are too fond of press freedom , and everyone has secret dreams about bombing some opposition ... just because you think something is bad does not mean they might not secretly be envious . 
  people like people who get stuff done . 
  now , how many of us would they need to jail before we got rid of the zdf ? 
   i think it really shows the paranoia and thought which remains in the russian leadership . 
  russia needs nuclear weapons to ensure that regardless of conventional power , they can destroy any country which may attempt to attack them . 
  well , what 's the difference between iraq and north korea ? 
  north korea got the bomb . 
  oh , i do understand per capita . 
  i am saying he kind of got a bit of selection bias . 
  if i compare the population of singapore vs. the population of africa , of course the singaporians are - per capita - richer . 
  such a comparison , though , does n't show the whole picture . 
   why does the french crew need to wear headscarfs when they 're not even muslims , there is no reason at all . 
  why does the cook islander crew have to wear clothes in europe when they 're not even europeans , there is no reason at all . 
  the answer , of course , is that different cultures have different cultural norms , and guests are to follow those rules . 
  yeah , but then we got 150 million more people . 
  if you want this comparison to be fair , you need to compare the average european vs. the average canadian + us-american + mexican ... 
  i 'd wager their footprint comes down a lot then . 
  yeah , that 's why we feel the need to ban the npd , the most prominent faction , and have felt that need for more than a decade now - and why the current sed incarnation ( at 20 % no less ) is closely watched by the verfassungsschutz ... 
  you 've already made up your mind about the existance of such notions and accused two of germany 's most reputable media sources of making up polls . 
  this is exactly how pegidists work , and given that you can not convince the crazy , i will end this conversation here . 
  have fun chanting in dresden on monday . 
  well , i see mostly elder people and young professionals , with opinions raging from concern for their own future and security to stuff that would make an obersturmbannf\u00fchrer blush . 
  very young people and people far in the leftist-alternative scene are different , but i see a strong anti-migration bias in the general population . 
  ( this is baw\u00fc , btw ), 
   the other list a non-existant survey . 
  hahaha , so you 're one of the l\u00fcgenpresse crowd , are n't you ? 
   the amount of gloating and admiration you have for a poor petro state russia does a lot of things right , they play the international scene well - still , considering them a capable player is n't exactly admiration . 
   you must think usa rules the universe i do think that there is very little clay where the us has no influence , yes . 
  i got you two reputable secondary sources . 
  if that is n't good enough for you , nothing is . 
   i 'm pretty amazed to see this kind of thing coming from a public service broadcaster . 
  seriously , you are *** amazed *** to see propaganda from state-run tv ? 
  ... immediately afterwards , we had four nazi parties and more communist splinter parties than i can remember . 
  well , i would wager they just would move to the next-most-radical party , which would be the linke ( which is surprisingly anti-immigrant in the east ) . 
  funny how that quote works both ways , is n't it ? 
  kant did not say `` be ` good ' '' , he said `` act like you would like your laws to be '' . 
  if someone wants the law to be ` no homosexuals ' , he would be perfectly covered by the categorical imperative . 
  that 's what the \u00d6r wants us to believe - that the pro-migration leftists are the majority . 
  a quick 360 \u00b0 - analysis tells me that 's far from the truth . 
  i am not paying money to get copies of old polls to convince a moron , for they only see what they want to see . 
  i 'd rather save that for when they come around to ask for some stones and cement . 
   then this is where we do stop because burden of proof is on you . 
  i dont have to disprove something that doesnt exist . 
  ah , the age-old cry of the intellectually-challenged . 
  [ but sure , let me do your homework for you ] ( https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=die%20mauer%20wieder%20aufbauen ) . 
  different years and different polls have different numbers , but usually , it 's somewhere between 20 to 30 % . 
  given the refugee crisis and the bad role the east plays in it , chances are today it would be a few percent more ... 
  the beauty in the russian case is that they do not have to threaten anyone , and still they are feared , obviously even by the us . 
  seems like the kremlin 's way works well . 
   and has one base past their border in the entire world why have a few of them if you only need one ? 
   any attack they make will get a response .
