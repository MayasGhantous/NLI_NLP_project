  we have the concept of `` shared responsibility '' - often , accidents are the results of both involved parties having fucked up , so both get to pay a part . 
  try googling for `` in [ state ] , it is illegal to ... '', 
  ah , so now a state body decides which news source is credible and which is n't . 
  i see absolutely no way how this could possibly go wrong . 
  well , for instance , we do not have laws against carriyng ice cream cones in your back pockets . 
  yes , i know , legally , we can not . 
  morally , we should be able to , though . 
  you 're talking about kfz-haftpflichtversicherung , while i think / u/mattk talks about haftpflichtversicherung , which is completely optional ( but does n't cost that much and is well worth it for the extra security layer it provides ), 
   like the haftpflichtversicherung that 's not for getting screwed over , but for protecting you against your own stupidity and accidents you could have prevented . 
  but sure , if you want to cover medical bills for broken legs and hips because you could n't be bothered to clean the driveway at 6am in the deepest winter , go ahead . 
   they 're going to be the fucking south korea of europe . 
  they also are morphing into a thinly-veiled dictatorship . 
  right on track to 1970s sk . 
  that 's not what germans do to poland historically ... 
  yeah , now good luck prooving that . 
  they all could have `` visited friends and family . '', 
  technically , gema does not delete . 
  it just wants its pound of flesh for the video to be shown . 
   they could let people to act freely at those times . 
  there are those who think people are generally stupid and need to be protected from themselves . 
  given what was known about communism in the 1960s , they choose wisely . 
   so , actually they were prbably just following the us ' orders . 
  i do n't see how the us could have * enforced * their national interests upon turkey in the 1960s - the ussr would have done backflips to get turkey into the boat , would likely have made them their version of israel - particularily , amongst other reasons , to control the bosporus . 
   becuase they supported the religion against communism well , if you have to choose between the pest and cholera , you choose the evil you have experience with . 
  evil maid attacks on nuke-carrying submarines , seriously ? 
  sounds like a problem you can solve by gluing down usb ports and not letting just about anyone near those systems . 
  and where did i claim it they had ? 
  so , it appears someone thought it is a good idea to link up computers responsible for launching nuclear warheads to the net ... how about the uk just fires that guy and cuts some cables ? 
  see it from the us perspective : nato had to be invoked once because the us let it 's guard down - an error they quickly correctd with a massive investment in leos . 
  europe just stumbles from terror attack to terror attack , while doing virtually nothing against them , and thus is likely to become a hotbed for `` real '' military conflicts in the future . 
  it 's not about leeches , it 's about shouting to your neighbor that his house is on fire while he keeps laying in his hammock . 
   entangled europe in an armed conflict that had little or nothing to do with europe 's own security . 
  so you argue that the rising islam-inspired terrorism we see in europe in the last decade only happened because of the us ? 
   they did not have majority of voters there is virtually no political system in the world where the popular vote actually matters . 
  yeah , good luck trying to install something like that . 
   democracy ca n't truly work in a system where media groups are being raided . 
  to be fair , we have that in * every * country sooner or later . 
  [ have one from germany from 2005 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cicero_ ( magazine \\ ) #incidents ) , and the attempt to [ put another one in front of a judge for `` treason '' in 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netzpolitik.org#treason_investigation_2015 ) . 
  or have the british [ guardian , which had intelligence agency agents supervise the destruction of laptops ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq ) to prevent information from being spread . 
  of course , we protest what happens in turkey - but it is kinda like the pot calling the kettle black . 
  given the turkish military 's track record , i think they should be more heavily involved in turkish politics . 
   they got 40 % in july elections . 
  which are irrelevant now unless you 're a historian , are n't they ? 
   so they did n't have majority of the votes , as you implied , they barely missed half in latest elections and they actually never got more than 50 % of the votes . 
  `` more than half of the seats in parliament '' is good enough to be called a majority , though i would argue `` more than any other party '' would be good enough . 
   presidential elections actually had same number of votes for erdogan as akp did for latest elections at 20 million , but participation for it was very low due opposition being unknown in the country . 
  just because voters did n't bother to show up does not mean the elections did not show a clear majority for erdogan . 
   first off , that would imply that isis is a state technically , isis has a territory , a people and the power to defend either - it fulfills all the basic necessities for being considered a state . 
  send them to north korea , give kim five hundred bucks for each one . 
  actually , the eu has very nice working agreements with serbia about taking back extradited serbian nationals . 
  actually , there might be local laws to prevent this , but there actually is no international treaty preventing a state from kicking someone into statelessness for being a threat . 
  it is my understanding that at least since 2005 , that was more or less a moot point . 
  also , being anti-military in turkey does n't exactly translate to being pacifist in the west - the military is/was a strong political actor who was opposed to anti-kemalist factions like the akp . 
  well , they got around 58 % in the presidental election of 2014 , and roughly 49,5 % in the last parliamentary election of november 2015 . 
  the lowest results for elections which actually have an effect for today are the municipal ones of 2014 - when they still got 42,87 % . 
  so ... which election are you talking about ? 
  so , now the question is , did we already transfer those 6 billion euros to him ? 
  as the akp got a majority in the last election , it is safe to assume the majority of turkish voters are anti-western . 
  surprisingly , i do not * feel * particularily free . 
  maybe we should find a balance that 's closer to what the americans have . 
  the putin one translates pretty well compared to the erdogan one . 
  given the username is * very * german , i think he 's far away from turkey 's borders . 
  now , given i am not a native speaker ... did i tapdance in the minefield of inappropriate designations for people occupying the british islands again ? 
  englishman is a no-go , they say , while scotsman would be a-ok for people from scotland . 
  so you 've stirred my curiosity - why is `` briton '' wrong ? 
  `` fascism '' , even though the political left does n't seem to understand this , is actually a word that has meaning , and is * one * far-right variant , with many others existing . 
  `` wall them off , watch them closely '' ... yeah , * that * 's what we 're going to do , given our historically very successful track records . 
  yeah , good luck convincing britons of that . 
  parts of kreuzberg . 
  it 's not limited to berlin , either : duisburg-marxloh , for instance is called a no-go-area by the german police . 
  which was mostly due to them giving us a conservative , * likeable * mp , in stark constrast to the conservative guys who were way out of touch with the population the cdu gave us ( often without an election by resigning inter-term ), 
  yeah , i really would have trained medical personnel rule on that in a case-to-case decision . 
  well , * one * of the causes of such necessity is * phimosis * , and [ wikipedia says it 's happening in 1 % -50 % of males ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phimosis#epidemiology ) ( nsfw ) . 
  of course , this does not say anything about the necessity of surgical procedures . 
  to say it with the [ greatest british philosopher ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5xd97hey70&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=26s ) : belgium is a country that was invented so britain and germany have neutral ground to fight out their disagreements on . 
  was she free to leave in those 47 years , a chance she did not take ? 
  if so : it is premediated murder . 
  i do not see how this could be considered self-defense . 
  wait , belgium still exists ? 
   circumcisions is genital mutilation and should only be allowed to be preformed on consenting adults ,18 year or older . 
  with the exception for medical necessity , which does exist in rare cases . 
  ... and nothing of value would be lost . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  plus , merkel has had an `` destroy enemies in your own party '' approach , so right now , there are n't any powerful inner-party opponents left ( with the notable exception of sch\u00e4uble , who - let 's not kid ourselves - noone wants to see as a chancellor . ), 
  think kim jong un , or your random off-the-mill bond villain  highly intelligent , but most certainly a little strange in the head , with the capabilities and will to cause a lot of damage . 
  hm , maybe , subconsciously , i thought that there was no need for the hard stuff once you got weed . 
  yes , typing it out makes me realize how stupid that sounds . 
  til the netherlands - of all countries - have a problem with drug gangs . 
  we love madmen being in control . 
  it makes the common german more sane in comparison and hardly ever goes wrong . 
  ... which was mostly because it was rock-solid . 
  ... and then we allowed the austrians to control our decisions ... again . 
  we 've learned our lesson on austrians and their ideas on politics . 
   does anyone have any actual level headed explanation for berlins behavior in all this shit ? 
  the easy answer is that merkel might be certifiable , a true simad . 
  the difficult answer involves merkel trying to leave a legacy after years of inaction by being `` the good mother '' and failing hard , to the point where she destroys the legacy of her political father kohl ( `` europe without borders '' ) and her own . 
  just imagine : someone got paid for this . 
  it 's not that easy , actually - [ depending on which law you read in , a child can be anyone under 13 , 14 , 15 or 18 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kindheit#deutschland ) . 
  i referred to the widest definition in the bgb . 
   13 year old is `` child '' ?
