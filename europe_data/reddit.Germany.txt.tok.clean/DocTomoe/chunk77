  preteen maybe , teen perhaps , but `` child '' ? 
  legally speaking , people under 18 are considered children in germany . 
   12 years old , what about 13 , 14 , 15 ? 
  congratulations , you understood the problem . 
   `` oh your honor i was 19 i did n't realize how wrong my actions were but now i 'm 20 actually , while you are considered adult at age 18 in germany , you can be tried as a youth offender up to age 21 , if it is questionable that you are `` adult enough '' . 
   bamf just for those who do n't know : bamf = bundesamt f\u00fcr migration und fl\u00fcchtlinge ( `` federal office for migration and refugees '' ), 
  yeah ... particularily given that last year 's russian entry was actually one of the better songs of the contest . 
  yeah , [ we had one of those as well , though it never made it to esc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jji3h-igdgo ), 
  well , we * did * put a long of effort into changing our image . 
  never thought we would be * that * successful , though . 
  i would vote the shit out of * that * song , without even hearing more than the title . 
  yeah , there 's no shortage of * those * . 
  the dhingy 's life-savers read `` olympic '' which is a reference to the conspiracy theory that instead of the titanic , the worse-built olympic was deliberately sunk in a large-scale insurance fraud scheme . 
  i can bring some schweinshaxn and beer . 
  also , a plan for some fortifications ... 
  worst enemy : france closest rival : france . 
  bonus round : best friend : france . 
  hm , from my experience , it appears that the integration was mostly in creating in - and outgroups early , so that you have all-arab , all-turkish and all-european cliques ready when you start primary school . 
  yeah , they have . 
  those are not gdr-style , though , there are no `` pioniere '' and no fdj . 
  child care does not stop with kindergarten . 
  giving your child to be raised by the state has worked so well for us in the past . 
   the worst part is that they are protected by the same amnesty law that freed their victims . 
  actually , that was one of the main reasons you did not have another civil war in the late 1970s/early 1980s ... 
  [ let 's have this page ] ( http://realbusiness.co.uk/article/26248-top-10-uk-exports ) as a matter of discussion . 
  precious metals . 
  now , how many diamond mines are there in wales ? 
  none ? 
  well , then maybe they are n't * producing * , but dealing with these things , which makes them just another superfluous middleman . 
  a whopping 18 % of output !, 
  machinery - this is most likely related to wharfs ( which are ridiculously expensive ) and reactor vessles ( which is a shrinking market ) . 
  mineral fuels including oil - yeah , we 're living in the 21st century , these things are about to become uninteresting . 
  also , chances are that scotland would leave a brexitted britain and return to the eu . 
  11 % 42 % of economic output in industries that are either complete bullshit or about to die . 
  yeah , `` lots of stuff '' . 
  well , first , you would need to want to trade something from the uk . 
  which ... well , does n't produce very much in recent years . 
   why would china help a country it 's sanctioning and denouncing and why would russia help ? 
  neither needs nato / another us ally bordering directly to them . 
   but they have no means of delivering it by missile you 're still thinking like the 20 ^ th century . 
  [ it 's the globalized future now - and delivery systems are ridiculously cheap . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=shipping+container&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=653&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewil7o3tvcrkahwlj3ikhazubt4q_auibigb ), 
   nk declares war on the south , they kill each other nk starts nukes . 
  us retaliates . 
  china comes to help , so does russia , because why not . 
  sweden wo n't get paid . 
  how do you plan to keep supply lines for those systems open to halfway around the globe ? 
   well . 
  do nk have technology to find the swedish u-boats ? 
  do they need to ? 
  last time i checked , north korea was not dependant on water-based supply lines . 
   do they have planes that can withstand jas gripen ? 
  and pray , where are the swedish cv groups to serve as airbases , because the gripen wo n't fly non-stop missions of 40k klicks and it is highly doubtful if south korea or japan would be stupid enough to serve as a nuke target because they support the swedish side . 
  that 's what germans thought at d-day . 
  until we had to realize the allied side would just send people to get shot until we were out of ammo . 
  north korea : * active frontline personnel : 690,000 * active reserve personnel : 4,500,000 sweden : * active frontline personnel : 14,000 * active reserve personnel : 26,000 numbers according to http://www.globalfirepower.com so 144 north koreans for every swedish soldier . 
  swedish technology should better * be * magic . 
  one of the smallest military forces of the world against one of the biggest , on the other side of the globe ? 
  yeah , sure , that 's gon na happen . 
   you got a pretty pathetic view of your people . 
  i 've lived long enough with them to extrapolate likely future outcomes . 
   ed gein  `` gein confessed to killing two women -- tavern owner mary hogan on december 8 , 1954 , and a plainfield hardware store owner , bernice worden , on november 16 , 1957 ''  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ed_gein that and the family thing - plus the fucked up shit he did which included collecting samples and most likely necrophilic acts - put him deeply into the `` kitschy 1980s movie serial killer '' area for me , if not by the numbers , then by intend . 
  there will be a limiting number eventually - but it will be a lot higher than the number of migrants in that year , and not be enforced in the end because `` you can not make them die '' . 
   i do realize the poll numbers of afd are still kind of low with 10 % , but is n't there the risk of a landslide if problems and costs are rising ? 
  i do n't think the afd will get a landslide victory - the german voter is too lethargic for that . 
  in the end , we will accept . 
  yes , but on another level . 
  also , as i have stated : eu treaties are more of a constitutional thing . 
  the bundestag * can * change our de-facto constitution . 
   neither can a state parliament change an international treaty unilaterally , do you see a democratic defecit in that ? 
  [ actually , there are parliaments who can . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_clause ) . 
  also , eu treaties are a lot more invasive than mere bilateral treaties between souvereign nations , they are more on a constitutional level . 
  yeah , not gon na happen . 
  if we want to enforce border security , that means authorizing - and using - lethal force . 
  berlin is not prepared to do that . 
  actually , the cdu was more a zentrums-successor . 
  the cdu never tried to openly reestablish fascism . 
  the nsdap successor was the srp , which we banned , and nowadays , the npd . 
  obviously , noone is going to start a coalition with them . 
   so stop doing this with die linke . 
  ... which essentially is powerless and just a location you dump your failed politicians to . 
  nope , the buchenwald ones also are a myth . 
  there was , though , an american serial killer who did something like that in the 1950s . 
  note how i talked about generations and how they generally see the whole euro/eu thing - these are not my views . 
  my view is that the european union is a highly undemocratic economic institution and should therefore be disbanded and replaced by a truly democratic political institution without actually being a * federation * in the old sense of the word . 
  yeah , given that we built one of those in the 1980s ( see : hermes ) , that 's progress . 
   what 's your guess about the next kanzlerkandidat ? 
  three likely contenders : 1 . 
  ursula von der leyen - though she 's `` merkel 's pet '' , which will damage her . 
  also , there 's that issue with the likely plagiarized thesis 3 . 
  julia kl\u00f6ckner . 
  young , somewhat attractive , deeply conservative and anti-immigration . 
  also , she tries to get federal media to notice her and has started building a powerful circle of friends . 
  for the coalition to break apart , either the spd or the csu would have to leave . 
  the csu wo n't , because there 's always the fear the cdu could open a landesverband in bavaria , killing them in both local and federal elections . 
  and the spd wo n't , because they actually do worse than the cdu right now . 
  the linke is considered a `` traitor party '' by the spd , because most of them used to be spd back in the day . 
  the other part is a direct successor of the gdr 's quasidictatorial sed party . 
  the linke is a no-go . 
  given that there is no way the spd will build a coalition with the linke , and the fdp is out of the bundestag for good ... merkel will be the eternal chancellor .
