  as a w\u00fcrttembergian ... 
  i would gladly become swiss . 
  these guys do a lot of things correctly . 
   do n't get me wrong that kind of attitude exists but it 's like a 10 % minority so , like , two guys ? 
  but then , virtually noone would put a w\u00fcrttembergian flag on the wall . 
  or we can just build a large wall around it . 
  actually , the swiss had a law in the making that specifically dealt with allowing w\u00fcrttemberg to become a swiss canton a few years ago . 
  do n't know how far that went . 
  yeah , only the crimea one * was * successful and quickly moved with the russians , so they should n't technically appear . 
   just because they are bombing the kurds who are fighting isis it does n't automatically follow that they are supporting isis . 
  they are also shooting down russian jets who are fighting - amongst other rebels - isis . 
  how much indirect support do you have to give before you become an isis supporter ? 
  and even medical doctors do n't swear the hippocratic oath , because it explicitly forbids a lot of modern medical practices . 
  yes . 
  solving this issue with force has been long overdue . 
  you need to fight to keep the little freedoms you still have . 
  we do n't want to have a situation in which freedoms have eroded so much that we got our own gezi . 
  that also is not how the concept of freedom works . 
  that 's not how the concept of freedom works . 
  yeah , it 's not like the polish would fine you ... but most likely , they wo n't provide emergency services in the off time . 
  i 'd make a wild guess and say snow and associated dangers ( freezing to death , avalanches , ... ), 
  i am surprised there still are syrian border control agents or working airports ... 
   that 's demonstrably false . 
  simply open the programe of syriza and golden dawn . 
  they disagree on literally everything . 
  yes . 
  and when they are elected , it 's the same shit , differently colored . 
   as for the broken promises , you can , and people do , punish them by voting them out . 
  for example , the most recent polish elections . 
  choosing differently-colored shit . 
   large scale roads have never , in history , been created by a private entity . 
  private entities can be hired by the state to complete certain aspects of it but they have never made them privately . 
  never . 
  feel free to prove me wrong by linking a single case . 
  railway networks of north america and early lines in india have . 
  [ projects for roads do exist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bangalore%e2%80%93mysore_infrastructure_corridor ) . 
  hell , it 's even a [ small business idea ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2014/aug/04/private-toll-road-bristol-bath-a431 ) . 
   denying this is paramount to denying evolution or gravity . 
  it 's not up to debate . 
  i did n't deny it . 
  i said because they are profitable , they should be easily built by private entities . 
   you do n't own them . 
  the public does , of which you are a part of . 
  the public is a separate legal entity from you . 
  if it was n't , you would n't be able to sue the state . 
  yeah , it does n't work like that . 
  i do own some stock , so i do own some parts of a company - and i can sue the board all i want . 
   and as a matter of fact , you ca n't access all you pay for too . 
  i see you do understand my point . 
   yes , they do some good to keep the community from revolting against them . 
  however , you can neither affect who they are or what actions they take . 
  the very same thing can be said for the state . 
   charity is not a government responsibility . 
  they argue desaster preparedness and protection of civilian life is . 
  surprisingly , they suck at that . 
   it takes money and provides services for it . 
  services that noone needs without oversight . 
   you can and do choose , by voting , the policies and the extend of them that the government officials must follow . 
  actually , no , you do n't . 
  what you * do * choose is one of several candidates whose policies are all alike , and neither of whom will be held responsible if the promises he or she gave to you are broken . 
   further on , taxation , unlike the extortion by monsters , is n't used to profit them . 
  yeah , in a perfect system , it is n't . 
  but then , [ we are not living in a perfect system ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/03/greece-margaret-papandreou-swiss-account-allegations ) . 
   it is , to a large extend , redistributed inside the country to help make great works which an individual ca n't not has any reason to do , but that do benefit society as a whole ( roads , large bridges , cheap hospitals etc ) and still , every single of these things were created before a form of taxation `` for the greater good '' existed . 
  people created something called `` companies '' for that , in effect investment funds for singular , large-scale projects . 
  the investments then were repaid by means of tolls . 
  why industry today should not be interested to build roads , bridges or hospitals today ( to improve mission-critical infrastructure ) has never been explained by statists . 
   you use these utilities every day too , as does everyone . 
  technically , i do , because i * own * them , at least a fraction of them . 
  now i did n't run the numbers , but i am pretty sure i own more than i use . 
  why should i have been paying for that ? 
   the mobsters just build a villa . 
  only when they do n't . 
  for instance , which organization is usually the first one to set up shelters and soup kitchens after a cataclystic earthquake in japan ? 
  nope , people would literally freeze or starve to death if they waited for the government . 
  it 's the yakuza . 
  not a singular example , though . 
  who cleaned up neighborhoods after hurricane sandy ? 
  you bet it was the [ american mafia ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/gambino-mobster-wristslap-rebuild-homes-article-1.1238705 ) . 
  all while the ~ ~ gang bosses ~ ~ [ prime ministers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maximos_mansion ) , [ presidents ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=aso+rock+villa&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=653&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmijrw07o_jyaivxlcuch0uvgk1 ) and [ royalty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qidyri4ci4a ) just build villas with tax income . 
  it seems that from the points you give , the two organizations are rather similar . 
  ok , let 's have a thought experiment . 
  consider the following two scenarios : 1 . 
  you own a little shop . 
  every month , two mobsters with wide italian/albanian/russian accents , a small one who has a quick tounge and a very large one who has arms wider than your body come in to collect `` protection money '' . 
  you pay because you want to avoid them using their influence to ruin you . 
  you still own that little shop . 
  every month an anonymous group sends you a letter demanding `` taxes '' . 
  the letter includes thinly-veiled threats that should you not pay , people with nightsticks and guns will come to throw you into a hole and keep you there , thus ruining your income and health . 
  you pay because you want to avoid that . 
  how can you consider one thing racketeering and the other thing `` lawful taxes '' ? 
  it 's the * very * * same * * thing * !, 
  again , you seem to think that just because injustice is done by some people in suits that consider themselves rulers over the realm , it ceases to be unjust . 
   oh please , that 's the same logic used by those saying taxation is theft . 
  technically , it 's racketeering . 
  theft implies secrecy and the absence of use or threat of violence . 
   is those hours at work that go into taxation slavery too ? 
  it 's racketeering , and you can get out of that by exploiting loopholes . 
   some countries need conscription to secure themselves . 
  or they could just cough up some cash and find people willing to fight by offering money , making it a job .
