   a culturally and linguistically unified 350 million strong domestic market to primarily target that actually is an argument * against * european movies : a movie about finnish reindeer herder 's matrial problems is of little interest to portugese fishers . 
   a long movie-making history with huge studios , facilities , expertise and financing aka . 
  `` signs of quality ''  huge incentives across the country i am not sure what exactly you are trying to say with this . 
   uses the global language in a world of dubs , this is n't really a problem , is it ? 
   india has a strong domestic market with arguably mostly poor quality films , with notable exceptions ; you mean , just like america ? 
  did you really watch `` boston '' in your local cinema ( i did , because it was a sneak preview ) . 
   china is even worse due to heavy government meddling . 
  china has some brilliant historical dramas , also , jackie chan . 
   south korea and japans could be the two shining stars but most of their productions never make it out of the domestic market for a reason . 
  you mean `` just like europe '' ? 
  also , i can give you a douzen recent asian movies without even thinking . 
   european cinema produces many interesting films should you try to watch some . 
  let 's say `` a few '' . 
  but lars von trier has n't done anything in recent history , amelie is at least 15 years old , and `` i am daniel blake '' is an interesting movie , but doomed to economic failure . 
   and it goes without saying that the number of viewers is absolutely not related to the quality of the content , with crappy but popular teen drama and comedies originating from the us being consumed heavily across the globe . 
  that 's cinematic snobbery - i can relate , i like an intellectually interesting movie as well . 
  but i find it problematic to force people to consume a product they obviously do not want . 
   i for one would like to watch more german films being german : you probably do n't . 
  there 's very little quality here , mostly `` komitteefilme '' - movies written with themes that can maximize grants from the state . 
  `` tatort '' quite literally translates to `` crime scene '' , btw . 
  actually , that 's unnecessarily condescending , and yes , it is as simple as that . 
  there 's a reason why european cinema is not economically feasible when american and asian cinema produces blockbusters . 
  tatort ? 
  there are few good ones , but overwhelmingly they 're mediocre at best . 
  if that was actually true , you would not need a protectionist law like that . 
   quality european content exists , it just is n't picked up . 
  it it had quality , people would demand it and it would be ( and actually is ) picked up . 
   and even if you were right , what is the problem ? 
  how can having more stuff on netflix hurt you ? 
  if you do n't like it , then the front page sorting algorithm will take care of it for you . 
  more european stuff will mean less international stuff , because on a spreadsheet , in the end something will have to offset the extra cost - and with mandatory eu streaming , european rights-hodlers will raise prices . 
  and cinemas show them - but noone wants to see them , so it 's only smallish and specialized arthouse cinemas in big cities . 
  showing unwanted movies in front of empty seats cost money and eventually leads to cinemas closing down for good . 
  why should they if they can just force everyone to carry their shit ? 
  please , do tell which ones you love . 
  have you seen our trash ? 
  it 's good trash . 
  it 's the best trash . 
  we are the greatest tv trash producers there is . 
  tl ; dr : `` we can not compete with quality , let 's make our shit mandatory '' . 
  we just give her a mutterkreuz to soften her up - and then sing . 
   to german kids they 'd quickly lose custody , and the kids get suitable foster parents taking kids away from a minority parent to be put into foster care ... that 's a little too lidice for today 's society . 
   you are tried as an adolescent `` can be tried ''  jail sentences are very rare . 
  ... for first-time offenders, 
  the americans seem to be pretty fond of them . 
  to be honest , the first one looks pretty gypsy to me . 
   ( except for some schnitzel-sauce , lol and 1970s pop music, 
  he 's not necessarily talking about areas that are lost , but areas that are under `` polish administration '' . 
  actually , as this guy is clearly not 70 years old , he has absolutely no right . 
   poland was robbed during wwii of many cultural goods like paintings , sculptures etc by germans , and stresses during the interview with the journalist , that germany should return them is he talking about museums in formerly-german areas ? 
  because we have an extensive program to return raubkunst - looking at you , russia . 
  after reunification , we learned the hard way there was no lebensraum in the east - only depression . 
  yeah , because in a regulated market , that 's what is going to happen . 
  honestly , how often does the eu want credit for this ? 
  there must have been a thread for this every other week for months . 
  a real bavarian known true bavaria ends at the danube . 
  that 's what we like them to believe , at least . 
   like when your borders are being invaded ? 
  that would be a `` verteidigungsfall '' , in which case the bundeswehr would be mobilized . 
  up to now , it has not happened . 
  let 's hope for our all sakes that it never will . 
   might have something to do with the knowledge that civilians would not giving a damn about their sacrifice , if they were killed . 
  actually , there is very little incentive to become a professional soldier if you can earn several times the money in the free economy without the possibility of some middle-easterner shooting you in the head . 
   linke and everything left of it hates the bundeswehr and thankfully , these are fringe groups that do not wield enough influence to manipulate policy . 
  your comment is wrong on oh so many levels . 
   1st because an arm race/re arming from them will be saw on many matters and second because they are between actually , we get encouraged daily to start an arms race to satisfy natos 2 % goal . 
   second because they are between 2 nuclear nation france and russia it will not take long before neutralizing the threat if the nazi come back which would be unfortunate . 
  as if we would not be able to create nuclear weapons as deterrent within days if we wanted to . 
  this is not north korea , after all . 
  in fact , a lot of right-wing extremists are opposed to the bundeswehr because they are seen as cronies of the current system . 
  so , which one of the two is the dsss person ? 
  on the one hand , the guy has very little hair on his skull . 
  on the other hand , the girl is wearing an uniform . 
  i can seriously not tell . 
  it 's not beautiful , but ecologically speaking an abnomination to send some joghurt thousands of kilometers . 
  i would love to link the results from a *** metro *** politan publication ( which includes a video of the speech segment ) , but it appears the powers that are are opposed to this site . 
  [ i can think of a reason why britain might not be a top vacation location , even should it come free ] ( https://youtu.be/sulihktthiq?t=1m16s ), 
  at least he is not talking about keeping eu citizens hostage like some of his ukip brethen . 
  sure . 
  let 's also send you invoices to access ours . 
  what might be more expensive in the end , one uk intelligence , or 27 european ones ... what do you think ? 
  actually , the spd carousel had been spinning long before they lost their social-democratic base . 
  improving german-russian relations in the process , which is actually good given we are a * trading * nation nowadays . 
  `` polling '' usually refers to opinion polls ( in this case : the sonntagsfrage ), 
  so hard at w\u00f6rk trying to find the hair in the soup . 
  i think everyone understood what i was saying  ps : *** before *** the 1998 schr\u00f6der election , [ the party polled at 43-46 % ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/allensbach/2002.htm ) ( figures from the cdu-leaning allensbach institute ), 
  it also was his second rodeo . 
  31 % ( today ) * 1,3 = 40,3 % , which they achieved consistently in 1998 . 
  he and kiesinger both . 
  look up who the ksk is , what they do , and how unusual camouflage might and in fact does help them achieving their mission objectives . 
  then look up what a burqua is and consider how much gear you can hide under it . 
  everyone in germany with a higher school education knows that the plans and early prototypes were weimar republic projects . 
  the trope was `` hitler * built * the autobahns '' , not `` hitler * invented * the autobahns '' - and for most of them , that actually is true . 
  in 1998 , germany was in an economically bad shape with high unemployment . 
  he started the agenda 2010 , which was a masterplan that diminished worker 's rights and unemployment benefits in order to get more competetive . 
  this lead to the spd splitting ( one part eventually merging with the communist sed-successor pds to form `` die linke '' ) , and many voters , traditionally from the worker 's milieu , to move to other parties . 
  germany eventually * did * recover economically - under merkel 's leadership , but because of schr\u00f6der 's policy . 
  the spd never recovered , currently polling consistently 30 % lower than it used to before schr\u00f6der . 
  yep , he might have been . 
  only that the ep is virtually nonexistant in german public opinion , and those who know about it consider it irrelevant and without actual influence .
