  which ... believe it or not , is payment , as `` it gives you something '' . 
  you get to go home with a good feeling about yourself . 
  if you thought it was mind-numbingly boring , you would n't do it . 
   i assure you , there is no `` self-righteousness '' happening when you serve on an obscure transit-commission going over ridership numbers that most people would find mind-numbingly boring . 
  actually , having a background in big data , i love things like that . 
   cheers !, 
  keep reading !, 
  have you considered a university yet ? 
  i have choosen , in fact i do hold two degrees , working on my third . 
  thank you for trying to belittle me . 
  in fact , of course you ** are ** getting paid for that work , not in money , but in the selfish indulgence of feeling self-righteous . 
  altruism does n't exist . 
  if it did n't give you anything , even on a just emotional level , you would n't do it . 
  you would n't volunteer at your local assembly line in a for-profit company , right ? 
   why are you giving me a `` beyind microeconomics approximations 101 '' ? 
  it is you who draw devils on the wall about a perfectly impoverished buyer 's base . 
   of course if you heavily tax workers not all of them will protest/go on strike . 
  i never said anywhere i wanted to heavily tax workers . 
   as much as if you heavily tax capital holders , not all of them will go away/stop investing . 
  only that one capital holder leaving for greener pastures hurts your country 's overall wealth a lot more than one , ten , or hundred striking worker ( s ) . 
   how do you pay anyone if you have nothing to sell/nobody to sell it ? 
  then obviously my area of operation is choosen poorly , and i have noone to blame but myself . 
  a perfect shutdown of all economic activity , as you imply in your comment , is a theoretical construct that simply does not happen . 
  what does happen is a time of economic crashes and money devaluation , which then is followed by quasi-money and a black market , in which the economically more savy will once again come out as `` winners '' , only their capital now is booze , cigarettes or bottlecaps instead of euros ... 
  would you work if you would n't get paid ? 
  seems you need someone to pay you ... 
  ah , nice , now you start invoking threats of violence against the ones who make our economies tick in the first place . 
  chances are you are more wealthy than i am . 
  is it ok for me to `` find '' that money at your place while i put a gun at your head ? 
  we all know what happens when you piss off us long enough . 
  we all know it wo n't be beautiful , and while everyone would get hit , southern europe will be hit much more . 
   he is implying that the ones staying in their places are ungrateful . 
  we got crazy right-wing protestors every once in a while - and conter-protestors , usually a few times as much , to counterbalance that , and to show the protestors they are a minority . 
  i note there are no greek pro-bailout protestors . 
  now , what picture do you think this casts on you as a nation ? 
  please take great care in reading what my fellow countryman wrote , referencing `` the greek population '' , and how you got the idea he was talking about you specifically . 
  argentinia only gets shamed a decade later by financial clowns taking their ships hostage , and being unable to force said ships ( and their crews ) out . 
  nationstates ' military navies getting effectively attacked by companies with less than 500 employees is pretty much something that does not belong to this time and age . 
  heh , this is exactly what i said would happen : if europe does n't buy , we will find other buyers . 
  of course , / r/europe was never tired of downvoting this simple truth . 
  two mouseclicks and one tan entry later , and greece is done . 
  who needs tanks and fighter planes when you can freeze assets ? 
  actually , if they have managed to invent something like that , they should build those things and sell them . 
  their deficit would be diminished immediately . 
  [ because you are in the minority ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/21/greek-bailout-eurozone_n_1615213.html ) , [ even in your population ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/business/global/euro-isnt-loved-but-poll-shows-little-desire-to-drop-it.html?_r=0 ) . 
   the loans are being paid back . 
   with interest . 
  this is what even greek politicians are doubting . 
   `` the uk might have to bomb your airports to prevent invasion '' huh ? 
  explain , please, 
  someone is afraid of this causing even more problems with scotland . 
  technically , that 's a coloured map , not a study . 
  it even lacks a source ... ** edit ** it 's actually from [ this study ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iq_and_the_wealth_of_nations ) , which has a highly ... interesting way of raising data . 
  in short , it is close to worthless . 
  so a ship of a group announcing to perform medical procedures that are unlawful in a country is not allowed to get into that country 's harbour . 
  color me shocked . 
  next on that channel : * us spy ship blocked from chinese port of shanghai * colombian drug-trafficking ship blocked from us port of san francisco, 
   with an average iq usually around 80-90 if you do have any studies prooving such an average iq , i would be interested in those , for ethnologic reasons . 
  if not , you might wish to change the statement . 
  it 's mostly xenophobia paired with reddit 's anti-religious stance . 
  nothing to see here , move on . 
  i am talking about those killed * after * the war . 
   the german basic law merely took them over actually , the basic law has no hints of banning any symbology . 
  the laws you mention are in the stgb , and those indeed existed before the gg . 
   i emphasize on can , because it all depends on your superior . 
  who might be a nationalist himself , or he could have the sense that ferrying a soldier back home is expensive and weakens the force you have to do your job down there . 
  there is an official , parliamentary investigation underway right now . 
  unfortunately , all the relevant files in out police forces have been `` automatically '' shredded about a week * after * the first suspicions were voiced . 
  how convinient . 
  [ of course , there are things that are undeniable ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-police-kept-jobs-despite-ku-klux-klan-involvement-a-847831.html ) . 
  those police officers later claimed they had `` no idea '' the ku-klux-klan was a racist organisation . 
  so being a fascist dictator responsible for killing hundred thousands of people is ok as long as you can make it against communism ? 
  i should remember that for ... future plans . 
  as a german ( with the background that we did have a reunification ) , i do n't see why it should n't be . 
  [ slightly less subjective opinion : established english-language publications use `` to reunify '' ] ( http://world.time.com/2011/12/20/the-koreas-to-reunify-or-not/ ), 
  ... now ask those questions in the powerhouses of the german economy : munich , stuttgart and frankfurt , and you will get less laid-back people with stronger opinions . 
  germany is a * very * diverse country , and berlin , itself being our internal financial troublemaker , is not a good place to ask questions and think you got the whole picture . 
   women are still underpaid , relative to the kind of job or as a nameless statistic in the sense `` all women per capita vs. all men per capita '' , regardless of job ? 
   there 's still a punishment on defaming our queen when was this last put into action ? 
  we have one for the bundespr\u00e4sident , and when this rule was tried to be used last year ( and for the first time , ever ) , public outcry made them reconsider pretty nicely . 
   many of my fellow countrymen voted for the pvv , a party which wanted to outlaw islamic schools ( but keep christian schools ) the democratic process of course does not discriminate against ideas that are diametral to your political beliefs . 
  i do note that the majority of the dutch still had different views from the pvv , or they would now rule . 
   wanted to allow homeowners to molest anyone treading on their property . 
  now * that * i would like to have explained a little more . 
  you 're right . 
  i changed the comment . 
  worldly amusements that are not affordable are just delayed pain . 
  paying ( slightly less ) what you can , but not more , is a good concept . 
  i have an east frisian family background , living in swabia . 
  both are cultures where work and austerity are known . 
  when i was in my early twenties , i strayed from that path , and i will pay for that for years to come . 
  sometimes , the lessions of your sociocultural background are important to listen to . 
  [ it 's their standard mode of operations . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_agency_for_international_development#controversies_and_criticism ), 
  ~ ~ and that is exactly the problem : why do we accept immigrants who openly despise our culture in the first place ? 
  i am certainly not a right-wing person , but let 's send those kind of people back to their homecountries where their opinion is more acceptable . ~ ~ ** edit ** over-read the `` non '' in `` nonimmigrant '' . 
  yes , we do have crazy people in every population , even the `` native one '' . 
  we will also have them in the future . 
  but they are a tiny minority , and they just do n't want to accept that they live the comfortable life they do because of these freedoms and principles they despise so openly . 
  20 % of the population as immigrants who do n't agree with basic pillars of our society is a whole other can of worms .
