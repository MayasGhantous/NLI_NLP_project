  people walk through the streets while expecting not to die even in oppressive societies . 
  again : by saying that those completely random acts of violence are an attack on `` our values '' , you 're basically agreeing with the terrorists . 
  i do n't feel specifically threatened in my specific rights when some idiots shoots up whoever they come across . 
  also , claiming that freedom of speech and expression are western values is exactly the shit i 'm talking about . 
  neither are equality before the law or democratic government . 
  based on what ? 
  we do n't even share them . 
  they 're not even exclusively ours . 
  you 're just trying to claim the stuff you personally consider `` good '' to set up some us versus them dichotomy between `` the west '' and the rest of the world . 
  to which the terrorists would say , welcome to consensus . 
   here is a map of countries with parliaments no , that is a map of countries with a parliamentary system of government . 
  you should have noticed that upon seeing that the usa is colored grey . 
  ... would he do so from someone else ? 
  i assume not . 
  the whole idea of `` it is an attack on the western way of life '' is just so full of unexplained assumptions that i consider it to broad a statement to make . 
  what is the western way of life ? 
  how is it specifically targeted by those actions ? 
  is it the western day of life to walk through the streets without being killed ? 
  how is this guy who did it not a product of the west himself ? 
  the point is that terrorism looks very similar in all parts of the world . 
  other countries outside the west have parliaments , and terrorists would attack them too , no matter what their cause is . 
  by jumping on that `` they 're attacking our way of life '' wagon without even knowing what that way of life is supposed to be , and why it is `` ours '' , we 're giving in to the terrorists . 
   it is an attack on the western way of life . 
  ... what ? 
  that apart from maybe that one moment where she let in the people marching towards the border from hungary , merkels course of action was essentially constant backpedaling . 
  the whole humane open doors policy people either keep complaining about or praising just never really existed . 
   do the german people honestly think they need to somehow make up for what hitler did ? 
  i assume there are always some people who espouse a certain position no matter how crazy it seems , but no , it is definitely not a mainstream position . 
  the migrants crisis , especially in greece and italy , has been going on for a long time . 
  that had nothing to do with some special offer . 
  as long as europe exists , it will be tempting . 
   nor that merkel 's extraordinary and humane -- and , for her , politically damaging -- decision to allow the middle east 's refugees to enter her country was the greatest act of contrition for hitler 's crimes . 
  this really is n't helping , no matter how well-meant it is . 
  that ( very temporary ) decision was neither an `` act of contrition '' , nor was it `` extradordinary '' . 
  unless of course we 're talking about what is considered `` ordinary '' these days in europe . 
  for one month ? 
  that still does not solve the problem . 
  the result right now would have been : first referendum leave , second referendum stay in the single market . 
  at which point the eu will say sorry , that 's just not possible . 
  which means we 're back at where we are now . 
  it 's not only that the people are n't informed enough to make that decision and never will be , it 's also that they ca n't just make their personal referendum binding for reality . 
  the eu does not care whether the people of britain want to stay in the single market . 
  making the question more nuanced does n't make the referendum better , it just gives the people the impression that they have a choice - which they do n't . 
   1 ) increased eu integration 2 ) remain 3 ) leave but keep single market 4 ) full brexit would have been more decent . 
  but not only does that split the vote , making it much harder to determine what to do - does voting remain mean you want to leave if there was to be increased eu integration ? 
  does voting leave but single market mean remain if that is n't possible ? 
  - it also does n't change the problem that people just ca n't be expected to be sufficiently informed about this topic . 
  no , the referendum would have been shit in any possible way . 
  this is simply not a question to be decided in a referendum . 
   macron is definetly an ` elite ' too , the question is whether you view that as a bad thing . 
  i personally do n't . 
  i mean , i do think there 's such a thing as too much , trump for example , but i have no problem with simply having a bunch of people who are just doing politics all their life . 
  and i would really like it if we could normalize that idea again instead of everyone having to pretend that they 're somehow not an elite . 
   ** spiegel : ** why should we believe that you will be any different ? 
  you were also economics minister under fran\u00e7ois hollande and you attended an elite school . 
   ** macron : ** still , i 'm not a classical politician -- i do n't command the usual established rhetoric of daily politics . 
  i am committed to taking a different approach to things . 
  you know , i just really do n't find that answer particularly satisfying . 
  this is such an important question for the whole current discussion about mistrust of the `` elites '' : how are those running on anti-establishment platforms not elites themselves ? 
   switzerland is one of the most successful countries on the planet , based on what exactly ? 
  gdp ? 
  quality of life ? 
  social equality ? 
  there 's a lot of possible measures here ; just calling it `` one of the most successful countries '' seems a bit arbitrary . 
  of course it was a stupid idea . 
  i 'm extremely critical of direct democracy in general , but with questions as complicated and far-reaching as eu membership , it 's straight up irresponsible . 
  because of course the side that puts some big ass number on a bus and says `` all of this can be yours '' will win and not the one that has to painstakingly explain how the uk benefits from the eu and how yes , this means making some sacrifices . 
  i guess it 's an exercise in `` who will actually bother to click the link '' . 
  sure , but if it is that short , it is too short . 
  what are people even supposed to learn in a single month ? 
  either we want military service , then it 'll have to take longer , or we do n't , then let 's not do any at all . 
  but that 's what we just talked about . 
  either we want people to be ready , then yes , they do need to experience military life and learn those basic skills and that will take longer than one month . 
  for example , german * grundausbildung * for new recruits takes three months , and even that is extremely rudimentary . 
  or we say no , they do n't need that , then why even do a single month . 
   people do n't want or need to experience military life . 
  then why even do it at all ? 
  now normally i would say , lets not take this as a occasion to bash the far right . 
  because the far right can be bashed every day on account of being shit . 
  but combined with the question of where he got those guns from , i do get a very bad feeling about this . 
  it 's fake news . 
  we have [ photographic evidence ] ( http://imgur.com/m2lschg ) . 
   ( i pussied out and voted for the snobbish version of the pvv that is closer to my ` social class ' ... new party without the stigma that wants to stop muslim immigration , which is the only thing i care about from the pvv anyway ) . 
  oh what a surprise !, 
  you seemed like such a nice person !, 
  you started this thread by simply finding denk to be morons . 
  fine , very agreeable . 
  you went on with calling people traitors and fifth column . 
  you finished with accusing germans of extreme `` guilt and self flagellation '' . 
  at this point , i have to wonder whether you voted for wilders . 
  the more you talk , the harder it gets for people to take you seriously . 
   serious note : if you endorse `` dutch are genocidal nazis '' then in my book you 're fifth column traitors . 
  you can of course say that . 
  but it makes you an ass . 
   clearly they are traitors and a fifth column . 
  they got 3 seats . 
  which means that 200k people voted for these traitors . 
  * sigh * see , no matter how much denk sucks , you just sound like an asshole here . 
  then they basically sound like the ideal leftist party to me . 
  it 's a shame that it in germany , i basically always have to elect someone i disagree with in some fairly major regard .
