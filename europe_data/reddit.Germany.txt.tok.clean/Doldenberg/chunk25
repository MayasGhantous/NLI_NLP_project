  wage slavery !,

  actual english person : `` lets acknowledge the legitimate issues that could have lead to this '' random dude on the internet : `` no lets complain about immigration '', 
  some are missing : ** what is ** ( luxembourg ) ** wait there 's another one ** ( liechtenstein ) ** now you 've got to be kidding me ** ( andorra ) ** rich people ** ( monaco ) edit : actually forgot the first time : ( san marino ) - never googled in japan, 
  * populismus * in germany is commonly used in a slightly different sense then the english * populism * , since the big parties ( cdu and spd ) openly admit to what could be called populism in the anglosphere in the sense of appealing to a majority through styling themselves as `` volksparteien '' ( peoples parties ) . 
  german * populismus * on the other hand specifically refers to political movements offering simple solutions and fantasies and thus has a significantly more negative connotation . 
  the problem is that this is always translated as populism , despite the somewhat different meaning . 
  so basically , cdu is populist in the anglophone sense , claiming to represent a majority . 
  afd is populist in the german sense , offering simplistic solutions and selling people impossible fantasies . 
  not right now , but after the inevitable anschluss 2.0 , definitely . 
  the child part or the euro part ? 
  see , this guy is a supposed moderate of the afd . 
  and even he is an utter moron . 
  in the recent election he ran in , during the debate he actually claimed that his ideas on education must be best because he has the most kids out of all the candidates . 
  now , i 'm hardly an expert on hitlers speeches , but as far as i 'm aware , direct references to killing where only made in classified internal discussions and documents , leading so far that even high ranking ss functionaries had to ask twice . 
  in public speeches , hitler referred to it mostly as `` the final solution to the jewish question '' . 
  other common phrases were ( paraphrased ) `` when the jews declare war on us - and they have - they need to be treated as enemy combatants '' ( remarkably similar to the whole islamic invasion rhetoric today ) or `` a big payback '' . 
  the most obvious but still veiled threat i could find was on january 30th , 1939 : `` if the international financial jewish elites inside and outside of europe should succeed to again throw the people into a world war then it will not result in the global spread of bolshevism , but the eradication of the jewish race in europe . '', 
  which is , again , not a direct threat , since it only states that the jews will be eradicated by something and only if they start a world war . 
  so not prosecutable under a hate speech law demanding a direct call for violence . 
  ( interestingly , some historians have made compelling arguments that indeed , at this time there was no actual plan for direct , systematic mass killings - `` eradication '' here referred to calculated and accepted mass death during deportations , with the ultimate goal still being resettlement . ), 
  sure , nationalism has led to the creation of nations and i have to admit that this , from an administrative purpose , is kind of useful . 
  but the topic is nationalism in general and i do n't really think why i should accept all the bullshit baggage simply because i consider the administrative structure better then , well , no administrative structure . 
  dudes , what the fuck is it with you and `` your party '' . 
  the swedish greens are n't `` my party '' . 
  i 'm not affiliated with them or even the german greens in any way . 
  i 'm not making `` political alliances '' with anybody and to break a lance for them , i 'd like to see where some green party politician has allegedly done so . 
  `` let 's ally with islamic fundamentalists to push social liberalism and social security !, 
  it 's the perfect plan ! '', 
  yeah , i do n't think so . 
  the point is that , believe it or not , islamists tend not to carry big signs reading `` i hate democracy and freedom '' with them . 
  they even , and this might come as an even bigger shock to you , are n't necessarily born as islamists . 
  parties are , unsurprisingly , not running major background checks on you and continue to keep an eye on anything you do . 
  if they are initially only a silent sympathizer or even not sympathetic to islamism at all and only start to become more vocal or radical later . 
  so well , you kick them out . 
  so lets give the suggestion back : dear citizens concerned about immigration . 
  how about not allying with neo-nazis and national conservatives since , you know , they 're the european version of islamism ? 
  well sure , this is a multi-national sub and i 'm to lazy to always state where i live when it is relevant . 
  see , that is your problem , you 're moving the goalposts . 
  you 're telling us that you do see a point in certain limits , but then only utterly ridiculous and unrealistic statements are enough to qualify . 
  of course he does n't go out and tell people `` lets go kill some refugees '' , because he 's fully aware that this is illegal . 
  so instead he calls it `` defending ourselves '' , he calls immigrants less then human , he imagines an invasion of germany . 
  and then he basically winks , saying `` well , you know what to do '' . 
  there 's people saying that the burning of refugee centers is an act of direct democracy . 
  is this a direct incitation to violence ? 
  no , obviously not . 
  but it 's not like the person hearing it will have to think twice what this was meant to convey . 
  if hate speech laws looked like you want them to look , not even hitler himself would have been affected by them . 
  and bachmann incites people to violence . 
  so what exactly are you so angry about ? 
   the us comes from a time where the english empire used their power to supress everything , so the reaction was to create complete freedom to prevent something like that . 
  and they did n't even do that . 
  `` free speech '' was always just a vague principle immediately limited in reality , even at a time when the founding fathers were still alive . 
  look up the alien and seditions act of 1798 , the sedition act of 1918 , mccarthyism . 
  heck , the practice of dueling people because you felt offended by their speech persisted all the way into the 20th century . 
  the right to absolute free speech is , and always was , a naive libertarian fantasy never fully translated into reality . 
  if you want to go further , it ca n't even be accurately be translated into reality because it suffers from the same paradox all libertarians ideas have : not wanting a powerful government while ignoring other sources of power that only a government could limit . 
  i find it pointless and pathetic but hey , if it 's your thing , i wo n't stop you . 
  just do n't try to push it on others or get angry when you 're criticized for it . 
  where exactly does it ? 
  because a green party - that i 'm not even personally affiliated with - has had islamist members that it then proceeded to kick out ? 
  it always sort of has , when you think about it . 
  indeed , i dream of making europe an islamic caliphate for whatever reason every day . 
  it just comes so naturally to us leftists . 
  it 's equal rights and social security and then you just suddenly get the idea to commit white genocide . 
  ca n't help it . 
  i ca n't really find any source on that , and i find it somewhat hard to measure anyway , since he immediately backpedaled - also something those kind of politicians often do , to satisfy both moderates and hardliners . 
  if you mean the specific elections happening after that , if i remember right it did n't really affect those either . 
  they always try that , and as i said , so does afd . 
  but the point is that there just is n't as much potential in that as in appealing to the extremists . 
  that has always defined their whole pr strategy . 
  and that 's what many people still do n't get , even some who are in the party themselves . 
  that 's what people consistently do n't get about the rise of the new right . 
  when trump recently made that statement about punishing women for getting abortions , journalists made the exact same error they made so many times before , predicting that this would lead to a drop in support for him . 
  but it has n't . 
  because the moderate vote has increasingly lost its value . 
  movements like pegida or the afd succeed by appealing to a growing demographic which is retarded in the most literal sense of the word : they 're left behind , delayed , they 're not up to date , they 're not integrated into modern society . 
  they 're digging out political discussions that had been thought to be resolved 50 years ago . 
  the idea of a middle , of moderation , becomes increasingly irrelevant . 
  well , not really . 
  pegida tried to appear as non-extremist to the outside specifically to avoid legal consequences . 
  but , like other movements , say , the afd , they 're well aware that what really attracts people is the implicit more extreme rhetoric , the stuff happening in hidden facebook groups and the like . 
   neither are b\u00f6hmermann 's blatant racist slurs badly disguised as satire . 
  whether you consider it to be satire or not is really not all that relevant . 
  most politicians , experts of law and artists in germany consider it such , and now its up to the court to decide . 
  there is no similar case to be made for bachmann . 
   edit to clarify : my point is his statements , no matter how retarded they are , should be covered by freedom of speech . 
  no , no i really do n't see why . 
  there is a difference between hate speech and satire . 
  no , not really , it has effectively reached peak assholery . 
  anyone who might think `` oh , this guy is on trial for hate speech , that 's a reason to support pegida '' is already supporting the movement . 
  not to mention that literally writing `` undermine the existing constitutional order of the russian federation '' sounds like some cartoon villain . 
  why do these people never assume that their alleged enemies might at least try to justify their actions ( like , i do n't know , `` free the russian people '' or something like that ) and not just go `` ha ha ha we 're so evil '' . 
  you just keep repeating that nationalism has to be good because you want it to be . 
  the community you build and solidarity you want do n't need the idea of nations or ethnic homogenity . 
  it needs shared values . 
  and if you want to look at artists driven by nationalism , you will find a very narrow spectrum . 
  sure , giving credit is fine . 
  seeing connections and admitting the influence of your environment is fine .
