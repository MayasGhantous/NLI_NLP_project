   maybe i misunderstand it . 
  they 're using a concept from critical theory ( better known as `` cultural marxism it 's real guys i 'm telling you i read it on breitbart '' on reddit ) called `` cultural hegemony '' , which basically refers to ideas that are so established in society that nobody dares question them , to assert that some sort of homolobby is trying to create such a `` truth '' through their programs . 
  basically , they ca n't believe that `` gays are people too '' is an idea that people might just naturally accept , but one that has been forced on the public by groups with sinister purposes in the background . 
  this is a translation , not a summary . 
  if you think it is biased , you can attempt to post a translation that you find more accurate . 
   well i agree that people demonizing people like kant for being racist are silly . 
  yes he was racist , he was a product of his time . 
  if kant had been around in the 1980s he would just be considered a racist bastard . 
  since he was around in the 18th century we can look at him in his historical context . 
  a critical evaluation of history is n't `` demonization '' . 
  recognizing such aspects of kant 's beliefs : that he was a racist , supportive of the aristocracy , a sexist , etc. 
  tells us something about the supposed value and rationality of theories of his like the `` categorical imperative '' . 
  if we do n't do this , we 'll end up with the kind of worldview where people loudly proclaim `` well , the founding fathers said this and that over 250 years ago , it must be just as valid today '' . 
  do you honestly believe that 90 % of women work as `` cleaning maids or waitresses '' or even comparable equivalents ? 
   only one of the major talking points which is n't there is railing against gun control . 
  they are actually doing that as well , but i did n't include it due to the lack of space . 
  i 've also said before that it feels very strange to see this in such a program , since gun control is normally not a topic in german politics at all . 
   i do however understand , that someone can vote afd as a sign of protest . 
  when the mainstream does n't listen to you , what can you do ? 
  i think it 's problematic to always try to completely separate those kind of positions . 
  sure , the most important factor for people to vote for the afd was refugees . 
  a vast majority of those voting for them say they voted out of protest . 
  but when you consider all those protest movements as a whole , then this stuff has always been there . 
  we 're not talking about some minor party of crazy christian fundamentalists that adopted anti-refugee policies and suddenly gained traction . 
  this was always part of the movement . 
  when pegida drafted its very first mission statement - which was already a lot more moderate then what they shouted on the streets - it already included a paragraph about `` gender mainstreaming '' for some seemingly inexplicable reason . 
  all the other paragraphs : islam , refugees , immigrants , suddenly : `` gender mainstreaming '' . 
  this stuff has always been there . 
  putin-apologists . 
  conspiracy theorists . 
  evangelical christians . 
  and i think that 's what people finally need to consider who keep on insisting `` but i 'm just against the refugee policies '' . 
  could there be a reason that somehow , so are all the others ? 
  that 's kind of ironic , when i posted in or / r/worldnews the initial responses were all immediately critical of it . 
  especially the climate change denialism did n't run well with them . 
  after a while , the typical conservative voices and `` i do feel oppressed as a heterosexual these days '' and `` well but at least they 're anti-islam '' - apologists came in as well , but it 's currently still a very balanced thread over there . 
  my translation is actually the top comment there right now , and there is no massive wave of downvotes on afd-critical comments . 
  i presented it without any sort of commentary . 
  on request , my post from / r/worldnews on what kind of party afd is : people keep asking `` how bad afd really is '' . 
  obviously , answers will differ depending on who you ask . 
  yet afd has just recently released a [ national party manifesto ] ( https://correctiv.org/media/public/a6/8e/a68ed5e4-32a8-4184-8ade-5c19c37ff524/2016_02_23-grundsatzprogrammentwurf.pdf ) . 
  already existing manifestos for the individual states are quite similar . 
  i say there are three core pillars of that program : v\u00f6lkisch-nationalist thought , radical economic liberalism , socially reactionary ideas . 
  they also deny climate change . 
  an excerpt from their preamble :  - f\u00fcr die abendl\u00e4ndische , christliche , kultur  - f\u00fcr die historisch-kulturelle identit\u00e4t unserer nation auf dauer  - f\u00fcr ein souver\u00e4nes deutschland als nationalstaat des deutschen volkes  - f\u00fcr die familie mit kindern , um die zukunft deutschlands f\u00fcr die deutschen zu sichern ** translation : ** * for the occidental , christian culture * for the historical-cultural identity of our nation on a permanent basis * for a sovereign germany as a nation state of the german people * for the nuclear family , to ensure the future of germany for the germans -- ** economic policy : ** too much and too hard to translate . 
  * summary : * * removing commercial tax * fixing the current tax rate as the allowed maximum rate * privatizing social security * removing mandatory accident insurance * removing public funding for artists and other cultural venues -- ** environment : **  das klima wandelt sich , solange die erde existiert . 
  * climate has been changing for as long as the earth has existed . 
  climate safety policy is based on faulty computer-models of the ipcc ( `` world climate council '' ) . 
  co2 is not a harmful substance , but a vital component of all life . 
  * government institutions such as daycare centers , all-day-schools , child protective services and family courts always interfere with parental education rights . 
  gender mainstreaming and the general accentuation of individuality undermine the family as a value-giving basic societal unit . 
  patriotismus . 
  * our values : civil virtues . 
  patriotism . 
  creation . 
  * the fact that the birth rate of migrants lies much higher then the one of native german women with over 1.8 , enforces the ethnical-cultural change of the population structure . 
  * at the same time , we are against the glorification of individualised forms of living . 
  [ ... ] we 're firmly against any attempts by organizations , media or politics to propagate single parents as normal , progressive or even desirable . 
  * we demand that the goal in practice of pregnancy conflict consulting [ ... ] is the preserval of the life of the unborn and help for the pregnant woman instead of abortion . 
  the afd [ demands ] , if abortion rates are not drastically sinking , to change the law to better protect the life of the unborn . 
  the afd is against any attempts to trivialize abortions , governmental support for them or even declaring them a `` human right '' . 
  * the alternative for germany avows to the german core culture , which is mostly based on three sources : first the religious heritage of christianity , second the scientific-humanist tradition [ ... ] and third roman law [ ... ] together [ ... ] [ they ] define the everday behavior of people , the relation of the sexes and the behavior of parents before their children . 
  the ideology of multiculturalism , which labels imported cultures equal to the native one , blind towards history , and relativizes it 's values , is considered a grave threat to the nation as a cultural unity . 
  * the current focus of the german culture of remembrance on the time of national socialism is to be broken up in favor of an extended view of history which also includes positive , identity-defining aspects of german history . 
  * the afd opposes the ideological complex imported from anglo-saxon spheres [ ... ] commonly called `` gender mainstreaming '' , `` diversity '' , `` anti-discrimination '' and so on . 
  it is not a spontaneous or organical cultural movement , but an organized effort of political lobby groups supported by massive amounts of tax money to ensure cultural hegemony . 
  * the classroom must not be a room for political indoctrination . 
  german schools often do not promote the development of an own opinion but the uncritical adoption of ideological presets . 
  [ ... ] we 're against the propagation of homo - and transsexualism in class and the ideological influence through `` gender mainstreaming '' . 
  the traditional family image must not be destroyed . 
  our children must not become the puppets of a loud sexual minority . 
  * the gender-ideology marginalizes natural differences between the sexes and thereby goes against traditional values and gender roles in the family . 
  the classical roles of man and woman are attempted to be `` corrected '' through state-funded reeducation programs in kindergartens and schools . 
  afd opposes this kind of gender pedagogics as an infraction of the natural development of children and parental rights . 
  the afd also demands to remove early sexualisation from schools and stop the destabilization of childrens sexual identity . 
  many of the views expressed in the context of gender mainstreaming run contrary to science , developmental psychology and life experience . 
  * -- those are just some excerpts , as reddit limits comment length . 
  this is what this party openly admits in their public party manifesto . 
  this is the whitewashed version they consider appropriate enough to share with the world . 
  whoever votes for afd despite it implicitly supports it . 
  well , the account is only a few days old , so you could be right . 
  but i think it 's wrong to dismiss anyone with those views as paid troll , especially since those are more of a russian thing . 
  no , a fair share of people genuinely believe this bullshit , and we have to talk about that . 
   everyone has an agenda . 
  only because she 's from poland does n't make her opinion anymore neutral than it makes frau petry an expert on german migration . 
  tell that to the poster above who just tried making that point , not me . 
  you might start with the fact that there is n't anyone even attempting to stage a pro-nazi play and might continue with the difference between `` pro-nazi plays '' and `` plays considered anti-catholic/depraved '' . 
  the political landscape of eastern germany vs. western germany has always been an issue that ca n't really be described with simple solutions . 
  people have attempted that , trying to label eastern germany as a whole as intolerant to effectively pretend that racism is just a problem of the east . 
  but as i said , it 's complicated . 
  saxony , one of the eastern states , has the highest rate of right wing extremist crimes . 
  at the same time the left , the only truly leftist party does better in the east then in the west . 
  one conservative columnist has tried to explain this with the immensely idiotical argument `` people go for extremist parties , left and right are identical in that they want to eradicate differences , social and racial ones respectively '' . 
  the east has a strong presence of right wing groups , but also of antifa-groups . 
  the west has other right wing extremist groups such as the pro-movement which have n't gained a foothold in the east . 
  violence against refugees happens across the whole nation . 
  the afd has gained a foothold in the west as well . 
  studies show that at least when it comes to attitudes , certain western states are more racist then eastern ones . 
  the west is still way more religious then the east , and that manifests in it 's politics : bavaria is led by the csu , the more conservative sister party of the csu , protest against `` early sexualization '' ( anti sex-education ) or `` marches for life '' ( anti-abortion ) or anti-gay protests mostly happen in the west . 
  if you want to hear my opinion , and this is also something that i think a lot of political analysts are now starting to consider , it 's that this all revolves around what we call `` b\u00fcrgerlich '' .
