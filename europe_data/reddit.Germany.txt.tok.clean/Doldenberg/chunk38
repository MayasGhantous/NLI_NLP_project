  see my other comment . 
  let me show one example . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.focus.de/politik/experten/bkelle/schreckliche-taten-in-koeln-sexuelle-gewalt-gegen-frauen-warum-der-aufschrei-gegen-die-taeter-nicht-ausblieben-darf_id_5189307.html ) birgit kelle writing about the need for a feminist response to the cologne attacks . 
  in the headline , she 's referencing an older german hashtag-campaign called #aufschrei , where women talked about the daily sexism they face , in reaction to another journalists article about getting hit on in a very cringeworthy way by an older , fairly well known politician . 
  [ kelle 's response ] ( http://www.theeuropean.de/birgit-kelle/5805-bruederle-debatte-und-sexismus ) at the time was to dismiss the whole campaign with an article called , i 'll try to translate it as best as i can , `` just zip up your shirt then '' . 
  she later wrote a book of the same name about her imagined prosecution as a stay at home wife , her devout catholicism and [ her opposition to any attempt to breaking down gender roles ] ( http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/digitaz/artikel/?ressort=in&amp;dig=2011/06/08/a0063&amp;chash=ec7ddb1310 ) . 
  she was one of the major figures of the `` demo f\u00fcr alle '' , a protest against a new state curriculum that addresses sexual diversity . 
  [ she is tied ] ( http://www.taz.de/christliche-aktivistin-birgit-kelle/!5033760/ ) to the radical catholic legion of christ . 
  source for what exactly ? 
   but i doubt that many people believe delirious shit like that . 
  you must be new to the internet . 
  do n't you know , basic constitutional rights are a very controversial topic in the enlightened realms of europe . 
  the recent proposed reform of sexual assault laws , which would have at least attempted to remedy is currently on hold because the government sees `` no need '' for it , despite the current law not fulfilling international standards to a satisfactory degree . 
  unsurprisingly , the very people who are so concerned about `` our '' women getting raped by refugees also tend to be very concerned about the danger of `` false rape accusations '' when we allow women to report sex they did n't want to have as rape . 
  to sum up the german feminist response to those peoples reaction to cologne : `` no one asked for your fucking concern '' . 
  as always , right wingers only jumped on the `` womens rights '' train when it gave them an opportunity to bash muslims . 
  pegida told me that it would rain , and then it rained . 
  i now see that national conservatives were right all along . 
  i thought your secularism worked so great to integrate people . 
  so what happened there ? 
  yeah , your secularism works so great , you got two major islamist terror attacks by french citizens in one year . 
  contrary to popular ( french ) opinion , french laicism is not the only imaginable form of secularism . 
  it can even have some quite negative side-effects . 
  for example , in germany , christian theologians have to be taught by a state-approved curriculum . 
  there are attempts to curb salafism the same way by creating a similar curriculum for imans , who are currently not subject to any legal requirements . 
  in a laicist system , this would n't even be possible . 
  the idea that religion is an entirely private matter also likely influenced the fact that homeschooling is allowed in france , but not in germany . 
  all in all , it 's pretty questionable whether laicism is really a good system - it makes religious people feel unwelcome in the public sphere , yet allows complete religious freedom in the private one , thus encouraging radicalization . 
  i 'm more annoyed by the fact that people conveniently choose to ignore that . 
  another user tried stirring shit about this in an earlier thread , so his post got deleted , but if you look at the more prominent photo , you can see a flag with the logo of the left , the not-so-creatively named leftist party of germany in the background . 
  on this particular picture here you see another flag , but i have n't yet been able to confirm whom it belongs to . 
  german sources and self-released statements confirm that the protest was organized by leftist groups . 
  those women decry the assault while at the same time making clear that they should not fuel the racist tirades of right wingers . 
  because there is a right to fair trial . 
  new years eve . 
  `` is n't there school tomorrow '' . 
  i mean , seriously . 
  that question would have been easy to avoid . 
  also , no , no such laws . 
  you 're not allowed to be at certain official events by yourself at a certain time ( e.g. 
  at a bar , at the cinema , dancing , etc. ), 
  but there is no general curfew . 
  cameron has repeatedly explicitly stated that his idea of how the eu should work is to pick out the benefits without taking any of the responsibilities . 
  i say , just let them go , really . 
  if the brits want to leave , let them . 
  if they eventually learn that it was n't such a great idea they can hold the politicians responsible who played with that contant threat of leaving . 
  since people find this so damn unbelievable , [ here 's taz ] ( http://www.taz.de/!161600/ ) , germanys biggest daily alternative leftist newspaper releasing a special caricature-edition tomorrow in remembrance of charlie hebdo . 
  fresh diapers over here . 
  they are not in france or germany , the relocation plan was for refugees in greece or italy . 
  if i remember right , it was also offered to hungary but they refused . 
  you 're aware that satire is more complex then `` just saying the opposite of what you mean '' , right ? 
  yes , but as you said , i 'd say that was largely confined to us writers - who were also the ones refusing to show the cartoons . 
  i think it 's a cultural tradition . 
  us satire just normally does n't do this sort of `` criticizing racism through showcasing racism '' . 
  or even this very dark sort of humor , like the dead refugee boy from the news under a sign pointing to mcdonalds . 
  sure , because victim blaming is normally unheard of in the west . 
  i always found it very dishonest how charlie hebdo was instrumentalized by right wingers . 
  they 're an openly leftist magazine . 
  the edition following the attack literally had `` all is forgiven '' written on it . 
  yet they have been instrumentalized by those very right wingers and anti-immigration advocates they have mocked before and continue to mock . 
  i would have expected right wingers to have at least a bit of decency , but evidently they really are the bottom of the barrel . 
  and they 're doing the exact same thing with the women of cologne now . 
  every single one that i know of in germany did . 
  i 'm aware that us newspapers were highly reluctant , but this is / r/europe , you know that , right ? 
  yes , but how does any of that relate to the original point of `` they are fine with restrictioning people 's rights in the name of safety '' ? 
  you 're aware that this is not a `` rule '' in the sense of `` you will be arrested for not keeping an arms length from people / if something happens to you and you did n't keep an arms length no one will be held responsible '' , right ? 
  as i said in the other post , it 's an incredibly misworded suggestion which thus comes off as victim-blaming , and is rightly criticized so . 
  but it 's not some sort of `` if you get molested , we 'll punish you for not following the rules '' . 
  german state ministries often sound somewhat strange , as they regularly have their whole structure mixed up . 
  the whole title is actually `` health , emancipation , care and old people '' . 
  `` family , children , youth , culture and sport '' is for some reason a separate one . 
  as said , strange mix . 
   cologne mayor henriette urged people bbc is getting really casual these days . 
   if they are fine with restrictioning people 's rights in name of safety where . 
  the . 
  are . 
  they . 
  doing . 
  that . 
  stop right there . 
  the statement has to be translated as `` regardless '' . 
  you 're attempting to translate it literally , which muddles up the intended meaning as it is apparent in german . 
  i can not find a single source for any for the others . 
  the only one similar to `` assuming that perpetrators were migrants and refugees '' is from minister of interior thomas de maizi\u00e8re who said `` this should not lead to refugees [ ... ] to come under general suspicion '' . 
  ( meaning that refugees as a whole should not be assumed to be criminals ; not that those speciic criminals - who are alledegdly refugees - should n't be considered criminals ) another one with `` regardless of origin '' came from hannelore kraft , mp of northrhine-westphalia , saying `` clear is that this [ prosecution ] has to happen independent of origin . 
  in the cases where [ it is applicable ] , criminals need to be deported . '', 
  the one about `` male violence '' came from claudia roth of the green party , also never using any word like `` toxic masculinity '' : `` it 's not like we can say , this is typical of north africa , this is typical for refugees . 
  this is about violence by men and about the attempt to exploit a situation - new years eve - as if it was a lawless space . '', 
  the whole thing is basically a fuckup on the mayors part . 
  their intention is to keep people safe , but they made the common error of doing this by setting up `` rules '' for women so that they may stay safe . 
  it 's well-intended but also obviously comes off as victim blaming . 
  it 's not the `` they 're trying to tell women that they have to tolerate sexual assault because of political correctness '' that the circlejerk tries to make it . 
  so before this circlejerk gets out of hand , could anyone here even name an ever so mildly publicly known german feminist ? 
  if so , have you yet checked what their opinion about this is ? 
  prescriptions are free for children under 18 and some others ( certain stuff might need to be paid private intially , at least in part ; with a later refund , e.g. 
  braces ) . 
  most adults have to pay a small amount , 10 % of the total cost , minimum 5 $ , maximum 10 $ . 
  you do n't have to pay more then 2 % of your gross income per year . 
  doctors will generally treat you well , of course there 's individual differences . 
  some doctors only take people with private healthcare .
