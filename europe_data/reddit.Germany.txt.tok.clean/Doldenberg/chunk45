  this actually reveals the entire problem of the `` the media is biased '' thing . 
  there will always be some reactionary idiots while the rest of society will move forward . 
  do we truly want to argue that the press has to give perfectly neutral coverage to them no matter how archaic their views ? 
  that would suggest that we need to report on everyone from conspiracy theorists to neo-nazis to fundamental islamists with a big `` you know , they could be right '' . 
  truth : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzbsgorplnc * sees youtube channel entirely consisting of anti-ukrainian videos * m-kay , surely that will give me an unbiased and factual account of the events . 
   lie : showing only pictures of crying asylum seeker children . 
  truth : most asylum seekers are men . 
  it is very clear why they do this . 
  i dont need to explain i guess ... 
  please provide a source showing that all or a majority of articles about refugees are illustrated by pictures of crying children . 
  you 're citing one of the mainstream media sites that people love to see as part of that big `` lying media '' conspiracy reporting on another mainstream media sites failures . 
  so please decide what you actually want to say . 
  does the system work or does it not ? 
   germany 's journalists waged a violent campaign against far right since 1945 . 
  oh , i wonder why . 
  the far right did so many great things in the years before . 
  you know , i really like that in this thread , one can immediately see who bothered to read the article , and who just keeps repeating the same phrases over and over again ( or read it and chose to somehow ignore it to do exactly that ) . 
  i think the fallacy of the golden mean is what is responsible for the surge in right wing populism in the first place . 
  you have one side making absolutely ridiculous claims , and another side simply stating the fact that nothing of it is true . 
  but people think that the `` actual '' truth must lay in the middle . 
  it 's the inherent problem of people not understanding that opinions ca n't compete with facts . 
  even if thousands of idiots believe in something , there does n't automatically `` have to be some grain of truth to it '' . 
  if there 's a lot of information on that , you can probably easily make it available for everyone to read here . 
  it 's from a recent ndr-documentary . 
  generally very interesting to see how common bigotry really is in the less developed regions of germany , but also that many people are still ready to help despite initial doubts . 
  oh boy , this sub really does n't like to hear that their beloved anti-immigration `` concerned citizens '' might not be paragons of virtue ... 
   the press can cry and whine all they want . 
  they squandered the goodwill and trust they used to have . 
  the responsibility of the press is to report what is accurate , not what people think is accurate . 
   especially when their anecdotal evidence and their issues are ignored by the press . 
  because anecdotical evidence is shit , and their `` issues '' are imaginary , that 's why . 
  seriously , there 's so many semi-famous clips by now showing attempts to simply give those `` concerned citizens '' the option to freely voice their concerns without any judgement , and they all end up with those people making themselves look like utter idiots . 
  for example , a woman in dresden , at a pegida rally ( reminder : protesting the `` islamization of the occident '' ) was told that there 's actually only 0.2 % muslims in the state where she lives . 
  her answer was `` no , i do n't think so . '', 
  when a local politican of the right wing populist afd was asked for a source on his assertion that refugees raped a young girl he could not provide it , and has yet to do so . 
  another recent video showed young people in some small village reporting what sort of stories are spread around , including `` a refugee ate a kid - alive '' . 
  and you seriously want to tell me that it is unfair to not report this important anecdotal `` evidence '' ? 
   that the values of islam have actually been european all along dude , just stop already with you `` values of islam '' . 
  the issue we were originally talking about was muslims praying on the street . 
  if that already conflicts with our `` enlightened '' values , then our values may not be that enlightened at all . 
  if you consider the very concept of muslims praying in public as an invasion then yes , you 're not any better then a conspiracy theorists who sees obama invading texas . 
   they 're not satisfied with being safe in secular and prosperous turkey have you bothered reading any news about turkey these days ? 
  that country is far from safe , free and secular . 
   on top of that about 13 % of these refugees actually sympathize with the islamic state oh , a whopping 13 percent . 
  well now that 's a really a reason to suspect 100 % , is n't it . 
   this is the biggest trojan horse since ... well , the trojan horse . 
  if the trojan horse was filled with 83 greek deserters and 13 who have some sort of sympathy for the greeks and 4 who could n't be reached for comment , yes , then it would be exactly like the trojan horse . 
  but i actually ca n't find that paragraph in the iliad right now . 
   is it moronic that homosexuals are disproportionally voting for the only party that actually dares to adress this issue ? 
  `` i 'm somewhat understandably afraid of muslim homophobes , so the only reasonably choice is to vote for western homophobes , gaining them the need political power to abolish my rights . '', 
  yes , i think that sort of attitude can legitimately be called moronic . 
   sweden , the country that criticized a gay pride parade for being offensive to muslims they criticized that the parade was staged with the sole intent to upset conservative muslims , by right wingers who normally do n't give a flying fuck about gay rights and actively oppose them - d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu . 
   and commemorated kristalnacht without jews , again out of fear of offending muslims that article did n't even mention muslims with a single word . 
  waiting times are unbearable and the service is non-existent . 
   because your very first link refers to obama invading texas . 
  maybe obama really is a kenyan who never got american citizenship , huh ? 
  yes , yes that is the fucking point . 
  obama ca n't actually invade texas . 
  he 's the fucking president of the united states , which texas is part of . 
  the idea that he somehow `` invades '' texas paints him as an outsider and texas as more sovereign then it actually is . 
   the point was the incompatibility between western and islamic values . 
  those people specifically flee from their countries because they do n't want to conform to what you consider commonly shared islamic values . 
   is it surprising that homosexuals are disproportionately represented among le pen 's voters no , because being gay does n't stop you from being a moron . 
   i see multiple articles referring to `` invasions '' , but none that treat them as if they 're a foreign group . 
  try again . 
  the very fucking definition of `` invasion '' presumes an outside group !, 
  otherwise it 's not an invasion !, 
   and before you reveal your `` clever '' analogy , keep in mind that the qu ` ran and hadith actually exist , unlike your conspiratorial homosex handbook . 
  so what ? 
  where bigots ever bothered by facts ? 
  there 's also real advocacy groups for lgbtqi * rights . 
  homophobes deem that proof of their `` homosex lobby '' ; just as islamophobes deem the existence of the qu ` ran and some stuff written in it to be proof that all muslims must be fundamentalists . 
   cite a single homophobe who is n't declared insane who calls homosexuals a foreign group . 
  one . 
  just look at the google-results for [ `` homosexual invade '' ] ( https://www.google.de/?gws_rd=ssl#q=homosexual+invade ) . 
  the term `` invasion '' , as you might see with how it is abused to describe refugees as well , clearly intends to label people as foreigners trying to get into places they do n't belong into . 
   in fact , what this argument boils down to is that muslims are a group that follows a set of teachings clearly written down , commented on and developed over the course of centuries that espouses values completely in opposition to fundamentel western enlightened values ... 
  but homosexuals are following the rules laid out by the homosex lobby , who aim to make our kids gay and completely oppose our traditional christian values . 
  really , where is the difference ? 
  no on ever claimed that refugees are magical paragons of virtue that would never commit a crime . 
  that 's what we call `` being human '' . 
   if the oregon shooter was white , so is barack obama . 
  this is the [ oregon shooter ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/chris_haper_shooter.jpg ) . 
  this is [ president barack obama ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/official_portrait_of_barack_obama.jpg ) . 
  please tell me that you do not honestly believe that people would assume `` oh , those two guys must both be mixed race '' if seeing those two on the street side by side . 
   yes , he hated the fact that he was half asian , that society did not consider him to be white . 
  if you looked at the dude , you would n't even know he was half-asian . 
  the whole `` society hates me because i 'm half asian '' was part of his delusion . 
   if he identified as white and was a white supremacist why would n't he put white on his profile ? 
  i do n't say he identified as white , i said that he would easily pass as white and that he was a white supremacist . 
   he was reported to have `` white supremacist leanings '' because the police said that his manifesto contained `` animosity towards black men . '', 
  as far as i know they never released his ramblings to the public , ca n't say i object either . 
  the media also reported he was an ira supporter , which was an explicitly marxist organization . 
  how you can be a marxist , white supremacist , republican is beyond me . 
  most people do n't even know that the ira was - in part - marxist . 
  simply ignoring all the things we know about him with much more certainty because he may also have sympathized with the ira is stupid . 
   if he was a white supremacist , it would n't make any sense for him to identify as white , as part of white supremacy is being against interracial relationships and believing that once white people mix with non-whites they cease to be white . 
  yes , that is sort of the point . 
  people who are mixed race by strict definition can easily be white supremacists , often making the non-white parent responsible for `` ruining '' them . 
  elliot rodger hated his ( asian ) mother for , while still insisting on his superior heritage of `` english nobility '' compared to black `` thugs '' who `` stole '' all the white women that he wanted to have sex with .
