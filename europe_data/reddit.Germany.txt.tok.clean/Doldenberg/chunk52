  that you feel guilty about ww2 because of your ancestry ? 
  i feel a special connection and responsibility , in the sense of not letting the same thing happen again , yes . 
  i do not feel guilty in the sense of `` the holocaust happened due to my actions or inactions '' , no . 
   you should , but you should not feel horrible because you are german , but , as you said , as an emphatic human being . 
  yes , but that 's what i said , when you tell `` everyone '' to do something , it devolves into no one doing it . 
  besides , i think it 's just quite logical that i have a closer connection to something that has happened in my country and that still affects it today , even if everybody should care about it in general . 
  but even if i care about , lets say slavery in the us , the armenian genocide , the gulags , i have to recognize that i will never be able to care about it the same way that someone directly affected by it or historically connected to it ; i ca n't even claim to care about the holocaust like a jewish person would do . 
  that does n't even necessarily have to be an argument about the quantity or quality of caring . 
   i did n't say personal responsibility ( if i did sorry to confuse ) but collective responsibility . 
  and then again , what is this . 
  nobody has ever told me `` all germans who will ever be born are responsible for the holocaust '' . 
  well , what do you even mean with `` guilt '' ? 
  do i feel horrible about the crimes of the nazis ? 
  of course . 
  that 's what i consider expectable from a empathic human being . 
  but personal responsibility ? 
  of course not . 
  that is the point where , again , i have to ask you where you get the idea that anyone does actually do so , or was encouraged to do so . 
   how does that make me more responsible than any other ? 
  it does not , technically . 
  but you know , that is what i mean when i say `` maybe germany has a special responsibility '' . 
  i do not fully think that . 
  i do n't know how to say it . 
  i believe that technically , everyone is equally responsible . 
  but when you tell people that , it just always descends into `` then why should ** i ** be responsible ? 
  why should ** we ** do n't do it when all the others do it as well ? '', 
  so yeah , maybe constructing that sort of special responsibility is n't bad considering how shitty people will act otherwise . 
   wow , what the fuck ? 
  i already told you i think the roma are europeans . 
  i specifically spoke about the people complaining about `` guilt culture '' in germany , it was n't aimed at you . 
  you are not morally responsible , indeed , but how does this matter ? 
  you still benefit from the effects of those structures , even if you personally did n't create or maintain them , even if you were born after they were officially abolished . 
  i also never really understood why people get so damnably upset about some implied `` moral responsibility '' . 
  i mean , i never felt personally responsible for what the nazis did . 
  i never felt like anything my teachers taught me in school - and it is true that there is a huge focus on the holocaust in german schools - made me feel like i , personally , was in any way responsible . 
  i do n't believe anybody has ever been told so anywhere . 
  but of course i feel responsible to never let such a thing happen again . 
  i think everyone should feel responsible . 
  but i also do think that due to our history , we should be especially aware . 
  quite honestly , the whole complaining about this thing annoys me terribly . 
  because the only people ever complaining about it are the ones who implicitly just want to ask `` why ca n't we finally vote for another right wing/nationalist party without being called assholes ? '', 
  because you are assholes . 
  that 's why . 
  the only people afraid of being called nazis are the ones who know damn well that their opinions give us every right to do so . 
  no , because the us has a sizable part of the population that is proud of their total ignorance and active denial of history , science and basic human decency . 
  the problem is n't that trump is allowed to run . 
  the problem is that there are actually people dumb enough to support him . 
   americans have done a lot of fucked up stuff and we do n't feel guilty about it all the time . 
  you know , that might be the problem . 
  of course it should n't persist . 
  but this whole `` the thing is over now , so the thing is irrelevant now '' is a very naive concept . 
  [ here 's a somewhat well known cartoon illustrating it . 
  ] ( http://leftycartoons.com/2008/07/10/a-concise-history-of-black-white-relations-in-the-united-states/ ) i think it very effectively adresses the problem of `` the thing is over now , so we 're not obligated to do anything '' . 
   vote as much left as you like , but vote a bit too much to the right and people start bitching . 
  you know , it could have something to do with the fact that one side is known for things like `` the welfare state '' and `` civil rights '' and the other is known for things such as `` religious fundamentalism '' and `` the nazis '' . 
  big surprise : the people who vote like the equivalent of idiot rednecks actually act and speak like it :  `` i 've been voting fn for years and i do n't hide it , '' she says . 
  `` i want politicians to help french people , that 's all . 
  it 's already hard enough for us , but what about our children ? 
  i 'm scared for them . 
  scared they wo n't find jobs . 
  scared they wo n't manage to make ends meet . ''  [ ... ]  `` i earn little more than the minimum wage for working at the factory , whereas others prey on state benefits , '' he seethes . 
  `` it 's crazy what you hear on tv these days . 
  it 's as if the jobless were more pampered than those who actually deserve it . ''  his wife , a part-time worker and mother of five , is even more scathing : `` here , we do n't like people who do n't work and then go and buy flat-screen tvs with their benefits . ''  [ ... ]  `` they 're banning pork from school canteens , and i do n't like this , '' lamented a woman in one such outburst . 
  when a neighbour asked whether her children were concerned , she replied : `` no , but i hear they 're doing it elsewhere and i do n't want it to happen here . ''  [ ... ]  there was an awkward silence when the mayor chaffed : `` migrants , here ? 
  they 'd be welcomed with gunshots ! ''  [ ... ]  `` we have other preoccupations here , such as ensuring young people find work in the area , '' she says . 
  regarding the plight of refugees , she would rather `` we looked after our farmers , who toil all their lives for a puny pension . ''  another voter , who works for a local energy company , chose to back le pen 's party for its defence of `` french values '' . 
   [ ... ]  he says this has nothing to do with racism : `` we 're not voting fn to rid france of muslims . 
  people have to stop fearing this party . 
  it 's not as if they brandished swastikas . '', 
  i heard about that before , a friend of mine went to the protest against the deportation a few days ago . 
  the concerns that led to the deportation are somewhat understandable , but i think they should have been allowed to stay , if only for the kids sake . 
  sure . 
  just look how racism has completely dissappeared from america these days . 
  you know , it would be fine to have a certain kind of context which is sadly not even included in the article itself : ludger w\u00f6\u00dfmann is a member of the ifo-institut located in munich . 
  it has faced massive criticism in recent month for constantly demanding very obviously pro-business policies : abolishing or cutting the recently established minimum wage , reforming the whole education and apprenticeship as to , again , be more beneficial to employers . 
  all that stuff was demanded well before the refugee crisis , they have simply relabelled it these days . 
  you might for example notice , if you read the interview , that despite saying that refugees will have a harder time learning the necessary skills to work , their apprenticeships should be made shorter . 
  thre 's also the point about minimum wage and competition in the job market , but by the very definition , the competition here consists of refugees being used to do the same jobs as others potential employees ; but without the obligation to pay minimum wage . 
  that is literally the only way that those people imagine refugees will be able to get work . 
  ( there 's other questionable statistics in there ; the percentage of cancelled apprenticeships includes such cancelled due to retraction of refugee status/deportation/leaving for other countries ) so in short , i suggest to take this interview with a grain of salt , as the economist questioned here has a very clear agenda . 
  you know what is really tragic ? 
  merkel is not even close to showing compassion . 
  merkel has already passed draconic new laws concerning refugees . 
  she 's still a conservative , her party is , and she acts like it . 
  she only appears progressive in comparison to the national conservative morons already ruling other european countries . 
  she 's only `` good '' in the way that franco was less bad then hitler . 
  it 's not just because i do n't support them , it 's because they 're objectively dangerous to the liberties that modern democracy has provided us . 
  you know , godwins law does n't mean `` if you say hitler you lose '' . 
  bringing up nazis in the context of right wing extremist parties is hardly hyperbole . 
  the latter , although that might obviously be influenced by the former , or the other way round . 
  right wing politics have historically shown themselves to fail and become utterly unacceptable . 
  they 're , by their very definition , rooted in ideas i consider harmful to the improvement of society . 
   french far right wing are jokers who would be considered to be a left party in many countries btw . 
  which one ? 
  germany in 1944 ? 
  i 'm german , my flair should have probably told you that much . 
  for the rest of your post , i do n't really see how i am supposed to respond considering that it just boils down to `` u r dumb '' . 
  well , if that is your opinion , no one will stop you from having it . 
  what do you mean ? 
  do i consider left wing by itself inherently bad ?
