  but bangladesh ... oh wait that 's muslim , obviously would n't like that , nevermind . 
  so i guess there 's japan , which is fairly decent - unless you 're a woman . 
  and then there 's india , which is fairly not decent , especially if you 're a woman . 
  truly some wonderful high-trust high-social capital societies there !, 
  yes , for example you can trust the chinese government to know what is best for you . 
  i 've heard north korea is even more caring !, 
  the [ swedish crime rate ] ( http://newsletter.twelvetribes.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sweden_crimesper100000.png ) has mostly stayed constant from the 80s to today , even falling down a bit during the 90s . 
  i do not see why there should suddenly be a need to arm the people . 
  * sigh * okay , lets go through this one by one . 
  you evidently believe that the nice attacker could have been stopped with more guns in civilian hands . 
  fine . 
  a crowded , tiny train . 
  do you think pulling a gun on the guy with an axe would have helped ? 
  do you really think shooting him would have helped ( especially considering that he was the only victim of his own bomb ) ? 
  fleeing civilians assumed there were multiple shooters because they saw police without uniform carrying guns . 
  do you think adding more guns to the equation would have defused that situation ? 
  you guys keep quoting me with the cases where it worked and how the guys who are totally coincidentally pro-gun anyway think guns are great , while ignoring the massive problems with gun related violence that the us , a country very much built on the whole macho fantasy of `` i 'll just stop them with my gun '' , has . 
  so i 'm honestly asking you , do you think those situations would have turned out better if they just involved some `` good guy with a gun '' ? 
  ** + + + man slightly chokes on d\u00d6ner kebab for a moment + + + merkel calls for state of emergency + + + seemingly inconspicious and delicious immigrant meal might have radicalized overnight + + + lacked `` mit scharf '' despite explicitly calling for it + + + isis has claimed responsibility **, 
  not this stupid article again . 
  it was first picked up by junge freiheit , a german right-wing conservative online tabloid , then by breitbart , which is , well , fucking breitbart , and then the daily mail . 
  now the telegraph has evidently picked it up from junge freiheit again . 
  basically , the original article , that saw no spread outside the local newspaper boiled down to `` six dudes misbehave and call people slurs , say incrompehensible stuff in arabic '' ( no mention of ` allahu akhbar ' , which one should assume most people should understand by now ) . 
  from there , it has somehow evolved into some weird `` sharia mob threatens to exterminate peaceful nudists '' story . 
  so i do n't get why international media decides to pick it up . 
   high-trust high-social capital society where do you find that ? 
  your dreams ? 
  [ huh . 
  ] ( http://a5.img.talkingpointsmemo.com/image/upload/c_fill,fl_keep_iptc,g_faces,h_365,w_652/vo008fha8uspwat0jem0.jpg ), 
  then your point is naive . 
  everyone thinks that if the moment comes , they 'll be a big hero , just pull out their big gun and shoot the bad guys . 
  well guess what , that 's not how it tends to work out . 
  where he was shot down by the police . 
  what is your point ? 
  someone who has seen enough idiots to see a pattern . 
  indeed it did . 
  so what do we need to protect ourselves better ? 
  more firepower ? 
  should everyone carry an assault rifle all day to stop trucks from running them over ? 
   it 's probably quite feasible to shoot the driver . 
  [ yes , it really worked wonders .

  no , people with reactionary attitudes are . 
  you whine about feminists , about leftists , about people of color and obviously , about muslims . 
  what do you think makes you so different from islamists who do the same , just for non-muslims ? 
   i personally feel like our world is n't ready for globalism in the way you wish yet however . 
  and i feel nationalism has long overstayed its welcome and brought nothing but suffering to the world . 
  but as you said , we may respectfully disagree . 
   i do n't think any of the terrorists that have attacked europe recently fit into any of the molds you described . 
  no , but that does n't make matters as simple as some vague `` radical islam '' . 
  of course it has to do with islam , but again , in a more complex way . 
  for example , what is rarely discussed is how organizations like isis are clearly the product of a clash between western ideas and islamist ideas . 
  what they 're practicing is not some incredibly pure and original form of islam . 
  you have young men growing up inbetween ideas of western machoism , casual sex , consumerism , etc. 
  and on the other hand , traditional values of conservative islam . 
  so they make up their weird ideology that promises them riches and heroism in war and freedom from the perceived injustices they face also as many women to fuck as they want . 
  religion is mostly a facade there . 
  now with the lone wolf attacks we 've recently seen , it is very much alike , just with an often added aspect of pre-existing mental illness or social problems . 
  so they use islamism as a valve , something that seemingly gives them purpose , also a sense of belonging , and again , heroism through violence . 
  this is where the similarity between islamism and national-chauvinism becomes most apparent ; and as the munich shooter has showed us , the other works just as well as a motivation and justification . 
  only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with ... a cargo truck speeding through the streets . 
  you might guess how that would have turned out . 
  the wall just got 10 feet lower !, 
  every time i read a post like yours , i actually get less interested in `` defending '' my country against anything . 
  because really , why bother , if this is what we 're evidently supposed to protect . 
  that does not change the fact that this religious fundamentalism did n't come out of nowhere . 
  it 's motivated by the hate against the west due to the wests military actions . 
  we keep pretending that we can somehow fight terrorism with bombs , yet bombs only create new terrorists . 
  and no , those people are n't necessarily convinced of anything either . 
  many suicide bombers only blow themselves up because they are promised a life-long income for the rest of their families . 
  we knew all of that before , we knew it from palestine and countless other places , and now we know of sunni muslims joining isis because they fear the repercussions of shiite militias who will just treat them as sympathizers anyway . 
  and yet , we keep pretending that those are all just insane religious fundamentalists coming out of nowhere , because acknowledging the complexity of the situation would require more reflection on our behalf then simply proclaiming `` muslims be monsters '' . 
   but we did n't bomb them because of their religion ... and do you honestly think that they just decided willy-nilly , well , our religion commands us to bomb someone , might as well go with those . 
  no , the religious fundamentalism is just a thinly veiled disguise for attacks they want to commit anyway . 
   muslims , much like feminists , have let the radicals take over their community and redefine it in the eyes of the public . 
  today on `` reactionary talking points surely no one has ever heard before '' . 
  i 'm find it utterly ridiculous that people even expect that to happen . 
  i mean , why . 
  like , lets ignore all the people who never wanted refugees in the first place , because they do n't really matter in this context . 
  so only take those who wanted to take them in . 
  why should they suddenly change their stance ? 
  tell me : why should i personally change my stance after those attacks ? 
  it 's neither , it 's ideological . 
  we germans are just the prime example of how it eventually turns out . 
  we should know better . 
  everyone should , but especially us . 
  you might notice how `` just let the germans have their vote '' turned out the last time . 
  what is so hard to understand about `` any of those '' ? 
  and i would n't want to live in any of those . 
   do you honestly think that if ** i ** accepted deporations as a valid political tool , ** i ** would stop with the refugees ? 
  okay , honest question : do you honestly think that if i accepted deporations as a valid political tool , i would stop with the refugees ? 
  then what exactly are we discussing here ? 
  have you ever considered that there may be such a thing as an option inbetween `` taking no one '' and `` taking everyone '' ? 
   indeed . 
  for citizens . 
  no , for whoever it needs to be used for . 
  the right to asylum is in our constitution . 
  i could really not care any less about whether it would be cheaper to not guarantee basic human rights . 
  a state is a state . 
  in the same way that i can expect it to provide welfare without expecting every single person to give money to random beggars on the streets , i can expect it to grant asylum to refugees without personally housing any .
