  creating such options will not lead directly to a dictatorship . 
   what if they decide not to hold referendum on climate change regulations or same sex marriages ( in the cases where they do n't want to pass them ) ? 
  you might notice how they 're already doing exactly that . 
  no government that is fervently homophobic will allow a referendum that would risk coming out as pro . 
  they will on the other hand do one to tear gay marriage down where it is already legal . 
  see , this is the problem with laissez fair democracy . 
  the authoritarians do n't give a flying fuck whether you treat them fairly , because they sure wo n't do the same for you in return . 
  no fascist has ever said `` well , they let me spread my fascist rhetoric , it 's only fair to allow them their anti-fascist one '' . 
  a democracy that takes no measures to protect itself against authoritarianism will fail . 
  there 's no slippery slope there , there 's just a steep fall . 
   are fathers wrong to tell their kids what to do because `` they know what is best for them '' ? 
  kids are kids . 
  young voters are young , but still no less capable to vote than their parents . 
   does that mean all children should be taken away and raised together from the state to exclude possible bias outside of the current political norm ? 
  in extreme cases , yes . 
  and what should that be ? 
   please give me an example ? 
  better education for the people , a reform of the media to be more approachable , more widespread , more responsible . 
  no more populism in the form of referendums for topics too complicated for the public to decide . 
  a re-politicization of the public sphere - when old people supposedly vote `` for their kids future '' , while those kids vote for something entirely different , there 's obviously some problem . 
  the problem for this specific proposal , for the general state of the union right now and what will probably persist to be a problem into the near future is that there is no united european idea , so there can be no european union . 
  hungary is one of those examples with an increasingly nationalist , authoritarian , chauvinist approach to politics . 
  it happens all over europe , but countries like poland and hungary are currently the prime examples . 
  and even if all the european countries followed this line - which would be horrible - the fickle nature of nationalism and right-wing-populism will mean more disagreement . 
  ( just look at the stance of different nationalist movements towards russia , often with major disagreements even in the same country ) i 'm all for european integration , but it needs a common progressive idea to be built around . 
  i am saying that the people that have lived through all of their lives in the eu saw no visible improvements . 
  which does n't matter , since we know the facts , and the facts are that britain has benefitted tremendously from it 's eu membership and that it will inevitably suffer when now leaving . 
  but due to the exact kind of rhetoric you 're presenting now , the whole leave-campaign implicitly ran under the infamous `` the people do n't need experts anymore '' - slogan , because of course , the people see it differently , so they must be right . 
   you try to spin it your way . 
  where am i spinning it `` my way '' ? 
  i 'm saying that i see a correlation between higher education and more politically informed opinions . 
  you 're the ones trying to spin this into `` oh no , ca n't be , because not all of those studied stem '' . 
   again this is not a problem with `` peopletm '' but a general democracy problem . 
  yes , indeed , that 's what it is : a problem . 
  a problem that needs to be adressed instead of brushing it aside as `` that 's just how it works , it must be fine '' . 
  the choice is n't just between democracy and authoritarianism . 
  you can support democracy while still talking about the parts where it does n't work as it should and where we need to change something . 
   do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i 'm not , i 'm just boiling down what you 're saying by proclaiming that older people must somehow be more knowledgeable about the eu . 
   besides these degrees include all possibilities from stem to art . 
  so what ? 
  do you really want to start some idiotic stem-circlejerk here ? 
  i can tell you that i trust even the people with degrees you evidently consider less worthy to be more informed then the average voter . 
  does n't mean that all of them are , but that they are more likely to . 
   this is literally a precedent . 
  this is . 
  but all the other things that those particular demographics have voted for in the past should give you a slight indication on whether this idea might be that great . 
   there are a shit load of stupid people with degrees especially in the over saturated degree loan market . 
  30 % of the `` degree '' holding voters voted to leave . 
  are they all also stupid ? 
  what brexit should ahve told you is that the older people , the people that voted in 74 to join the eu and have lived in it for 40 years have seen a decline in their living standards . 
  it shuold ahve told you that the poor do not live a better live and are in dire need of change . 
  instaed you people try to put people into simple brackets so you can exclude them as `` virgins or stupid '' . 
  ... so instead , the ** street smart ** , ** down to earth ** , working-class people with their ** experience ** and ** life lessons ** must be the true geniuses here for voting leave ? 
  sorry dude , but we know the historical trends . 
  they do not look kindly on the results of such votes . 
  yes , and that 's what i mean . 
  we have those kind of special units . 
  if we really have deficiencies here - for which , considering the very good work that all of them did during the munich incident , there is no real reason to believe so - we can talk about expanding those . 
  the whole `` lets put the normal bundeswehr on the streets '' thing is just cheap populism that would do more harm than good . 
  it is not necessarily wrong . 
  leave was mostly voted for by the old , the poor , the people in the country , the uneducated . 
  that is the core problem of nationalism : those who want it have to force those who do not into it . 
  if all the people who voted leave would leave the eu and all the one who voted remain got to remain , the leavers would not be able to sustain themselves . 
  ... where do you take from that i 'm mad at the uk ? 
  ( apart from the fact that i 'm of course pissed of that they constantly insist on getting special deals in the first place ) the problem here is , quite obviously , the eu 's leadership giving in to those ridiculous demands . 
  the bundeswehr ist not well trained , at least for those kind of situations . 
  they can put down a few sandbags when there 's a flood , but i would n't want them to act as an anti-terror unit . 
  that 's what we have specialists for . 
  `` they 've bitten of the hand , but maybe if we give them the arm , they ' l stop !, 
  would n't want them to go hungry ! '', 
  fuck this . 
  yeah , sorry , but people do n't really plan that long in advance , nor will they abandon their traditions that easily . 
  instead you 'll fuck the mutilated girls over a second time by denying them access to europe because their parents will either refuse to pay the fine or be unable to . 
  oh no , not a right-wing extremist . 
  just a concerned citizen . 
  less europeans than americans believe that climate change is n't real . 
  does that make all of us brainwashed ? 
  wah wah wah virtue signaling, 
  oh no , someone disagrees with me !, 
  they must literally be brainwashed , how else could they believe this !, 
  yeah , sorry , but i care more about helping those in need than satisfying some idiots fears about immigration . 
  how ? 
  ... so on account of not having the money to pay that fine , they 'll stay at home . 
  remind me , how does that help anyone ? 
  no , it 's actually the jewish-bolshevist illuminati . 
   why is there this paternalistic assumption that integration is the best , the people are wrong , and they 'll understand once it 's over with ? 
  because `` the will of the people '' is fickle and not necessarily correct either , and a democracy only works when people are educated to make the correct choices . 
  look at the brexit vote . 
  that was a vote of the masses , and it was a dumb one . 
  look at erdogan . 
  he has the will of the masses behind him . 
  does that make his actions democratic ? 
  no , because democracy is not just the rule of the masses , it 's the rule of the people . 
  it has a social responsibility for everyone , even if people disagree with it . 
   i have to choose between living among my ethnic culture or living in a modern , progressive society . 
  you might want to get over the whole `` my ethnic culture '' thing , since it 's where the problem starts . 
   and there is less euroskepticism . 
  there wo n't be . 
  the only way to lower euroscepticism is to show people that european integration works .
