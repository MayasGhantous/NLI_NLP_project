never going to happen . 
  literally a waste of time . 
  he is the context . 
   `` it 's true there is a problem with islam ... and nobody doubts that . 
  there 's a problem with islam because islam demands places ( of worship ) , recognition . 
  it 's not that islam is a problem because it 's a religion that is in itself dangerous but because it wants to assert itself as a religion on the republic . 
  what might also be a problem is if muslims do n't criticise acts of radicalisation , if imams behave in an anti-republican way . '', 
  in and of itself , income inequality is bad in what ways ? 
  the ehrc prevents deportation of criminals that face inhumane conditions in their home countries . 
  eu citizenry and/or migration status have nothing to do with this . 
  [ you can read more about it here . 
  ] ( http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng# { % 22dmdocnumber % 22 :[ % 22829510 % 22 ] , % 22itemid % 22 :[ % 22001-85276 % 22 ] } ), 
   there is also nothing stopping the uk deporting criminals . 
  a statement so specifically false , that i 'm not sure if you are just being satirical . 
  yea but op was more verbose . 
   therefore your 8 % gain is still a relative loss since gbp is lower . 
  exchange rates and growth rate are indeed related but not in the way you are implying . 
  currency devaluation has many pros and cons and the net effect of such an event is in no way gaurenteed to be negative . 
  a negative growth rate has * almost * no benefit . 
  you do n't . 
  yes it is about facts . 
  and as i stated i would like to talk about the facts and not what you `` think '' . 
  i 'm just going to short circuit any kind of socratic method as i doubt there 's is any benefit at this point . 
  here is the idea i was attempting to convey spelled out as clearly as i think i am capable . 
  it has been claimed that the freedom of movement to and from the uk with the eu is a ** functional requirement ** in order for the uk to sell securities in the eu . 
  by ** functional requirement ** we are saying that something is * required * for the * function * of something . 
  it is beleived by some ministers in the uk that : freedom of movement to and from the uk with the eu is ** not ** a ** functional requirement ** in order for the uk to sell securities in the eu . 
  can you tell me why : freedom of movement to and from the uk with the eu ** is ** a ** functional requirement ** in order for the uk to sell securities in the eu . 
   by restricting access to foreign service providers you create a local market for services , accessible only by local companies . 
  hence the market is not single anymore ( or the access is only partial ) . 
  i 'm having an issue converting our scenario to the one you are describing . 
  might i get some specifics ? 
  is it right to assume that : - the * single market * is the * eu without the uk * ? 
  - the * services * that have * restricted access * are the * right to live and work in the uk * ? 
  i understand the ideology of the four freedoms and i would like to have a conversation about one of them , the freedom of movement . 
  i would expect such a thing could take place without superlative statements calling into question what i may or may not have previously understood . 
  especially in a way that suggest that i 'm disingenuous . 
  anyhow . 
   passporting rights are somewhat of a crown jewel does n't this mean that passporting is a ** perk ** and not necessarily a ** requirement ** of this particular single market ? 
  clearly , but reddit humor is n't an argument . 
  want to take a swing ? 
   do n't think so so then what 's the problem ? 
  mind if we reenact such an event ? 
  i 'll be johnson , naturally . 
  i would like to retain bank pass porting without freedom of moment . 
  is this illogical or indecent ? 
  if so why ? 
  also , god save the queen . 
  sounds like you are not a nuisance and just living your life your way . 
  i do n't think the majority have any issue with that and why you will never see an article about some dude schwarzfahren on the night train . 
  the reason this story in particular is of any interest it 's because this gentleman eminates the kind of `` privileged vagrancy '' that many people see time to time . 
  sitting around the train station begging for grass money does n't imply you are some kind of free spirited creative soul . 
  pitching a tent in a park does n't recuse you of the ecological impacts of mankind . 
  slapping your protest stickers on public property does n't make you a warrior for social progress . 
  not having others from a country that you are a visitor of act like your personal chauffeur does n't rationalise destroying their infrastructure and robbing their stores . 
  it 's all self serving megalomania that increases with unnerving frequency . 
   `` purposely make the population dumb  the way the us wants it , since their school system is so garbage . 
  what a vitriolic and trashy comment . 
  could you support any of these statements without quoting how you feel or some vague anecdote ? 
  i understand that internet message boards generally evolve into some kind of circle jerk . 
  but this sub post brexit is near unreadable at times . 
  most are emigrating due to poor economy in their home countries . 
  it smells like shit . 
  it 's irritating to those with heath conditions . 
  its impolite to blow smoke into the face of total strangers . 
  the city is not your personal trash can to litter with your filthy habit . 
  it 's amazing how inconsiderate that addiction can make people . 
  `` freedom of movement is an indispensable freedom as the internal market ca n't work without it . '' can someone inform me why this is true ? 
  it seems completely plausible to have tariff free trade without granting the right to live and work . 
  what am i not understanding ? 
  that would only convey ones affinity . 
  however , ethnicity is not by subscription . 
  it is intrinsic . 
  there is then the dilemma that i stated that suggest `` cultural integrity '' is not something that can be guaranteed . 
  which i think most after really thinking about it will find quite obvious . 
  if you do not have a grasp of these situations , it would seem like your previous statement about `` people groups '' is basically non comprehensive ranting . 
  i mean , whatever . 
  but you are not doing much better than the political leaders you are implicitly criticising . 
  what land rights does an individual who is , as an example , half turkish and half german own ? 
  how many of these laws are applicable only when convenient ? 
  with the uk gone there is very little standing in the way of the bigger states from forming a coalition that can drive a federalist agenda . 
  nationalist should be free to do whatever exit they want to call it . 
  there was nothing voluntary about the soviet union . 
  force federalization and those countries not so keen can do their own thing instead of being utter obstructionist . 
  wait what ? 
  why are people making up fake words for br\u00f6tchen ? 
  they ruined it by photoshopping in the sun ... 
   nicht \u201e moslems `` , sondern \u201e personen aus dem moslemischen kulturkreis `` there is no way 55 % of christians meet this criteria . 
  it explains why the chart is confusing . 
  i do n't actually know how their system works . 
  however , sensor saturation does n't really anything to do with overflow or memory ( at least with the system in general ) . 
  it means the sensor maxed out . 
  they were almost certainly using control logic to stabalize the device . 
  this type of algorithm requires that the sensor values change with respect to changes made to the system . 
  a saturated sensor will no longer respond to changes to the system . 
  this results in something like division by zero ( the derivative of the model will be zero ) . 
  then was it a developer error ? 
  probably not . 
  in fact , they probably had a line in the code like this , if ( deltax = = 0 ) log ( `` we 're fucked '' ) the question is then why was the sensor saturated ? 
  i doubt they miscalculated the expected entry force and even if they did sensors are usually at least 1.5 requirements .
