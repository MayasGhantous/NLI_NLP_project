there is an article from [ russia today ] ( http://rt.com/news/193116-german-data-forwarded-nsa/ ) about it but i did n't want to link to that . 
   order everywhere is maintained through the threat of force . 
  if you break a law in your country , you get arrested . 
  men with guns will physically restrain you , and depending on the circumstances , might actually kill you . 
  usually it is social pressure and learning that inhibits the criminal side in most people regardless of their rank . 
  that 's why consistently good diplomacy and acting in a way that promotes trust is important . 
  not all international crises can be solved without war , but those that require warfare are usually preceded by bad or lacking diplomacy and education . 
  i find the belief that impeding corporal punishment is the only thing that inhibits criminal behavoir strange . 
  ask yourself : why do n't i steal ? 
  or murder ? 
  is it because i would go to jail ( or worse ) because of that ? 
  or because i do n't think murdering and stealing are morally acceptable ? 
  if you think it 's the latter , then you are either inconsistent or think that you are the only sane person in a world full of criminals . 
  yes but the means to enforce democratic behavior in a member state are very limited and the validation of the accession requirements has been unsatisfactory in the past . 
  [ according to ansa one of the two is also accused of sexual assault of a minor .

  [ yup . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812 ), 
  hardly more than trying to save face . 
  that was an informant , not a member of the police force . 
  and he delivered the explosives years before he became an informant . 
  i think the police and the verfassungsschutz acted very amateurish and neglectful , but you really do n't have to lie about their involvement . 
  germany ( and uruguay ) , but sadly i have to study a lot for uni in the next month . 
  so you do n't expect to win in brazil ? 
  regardless of the ethical implications : who pays for the prison ? 
  prisons ar n't cheap . 
  russia has nuclear weapons , we do n't . 
  the election will probably push svoboda out of the government and thus swipe away one of the more reasonable talking points about the `` facist government in kiev '' . 
  i think pressing disarmament of the prorussian fighters , a ceasefire and a strong presence of osce observers ( with a presence of russians in most work groups ) could partially dismantle the `` illigitamate central government '' before the elections start . 
  i do n't think putin plans to respect the election process , but it would definitly look better than just outright ignoring the potentially democratic voters in those parts of eastern ukraine . 
  [ osce group abducted . 
  seperatists claim that the group was infiltrated by a ukrainian spy . 
  you have to fake a signature one at a time . 
  if there 's a exploitable security bug in the id card system you can get access to a metric fuckton of signatures at once . 
  introducing that system on a continental level also increases the potential payoff compared to cases like estonia . 
  i 'm not familiar with their system but on a eu or federal level here in germany i 'd count on it being unsafe and tapped by some secret service . 
  this was stupid when they pushed it in germany and it is still stupid on a eu level . 
  signing legaly binding documents with a hackable device ? 
  no , thank you !, 
  considering the state of / r/worldnews , what 's your take on moderation ? 
   making these companies pay more or making customers pay more for access to these services seems reasonable if it means that other people have the option of paying less . 
  what makes you think that anyone will be allowed to pay less ? 
  you really want to spend more money than 1/18 of the european gdp on the esa ? 
  seriously ? 
  i do n't get the circlejerk about spacefaring . 
  no , not really . 
  the results from the federal elections showed , that they fare better with younger voters . 
  may i ask what happened between 2002 and 2012 ? 
  some of it comes from stormfront and other racist forums . 
  they see the subreddit as a good place to propagandize their views . 
  beeeeep beeeeeep beeeeeep ### nazi alert ### beeeeep beeeeeep beeeeeep [ m\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6p ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1vy6sw/african_people_are_being_kicked_out_of_their/cex4hx3 ), 
  but you are allowed to use clues ( city names/signs that you can google ) right ? 
  with google maps : `` challenge game finished !, 
  you won the challenge with 32390 points against 10000 . '', 
  do n't worry . 
  merkel wo n't let it come to that . 
  because of the pressure from the cdu friedrich had to reframe the joint foray as `` an internal paper '' . 
  what are you on about ? 
  the cxu has no majority in the bundestag or the bundesrat and the left could in terms of figures form a government . 
  [ we can do that too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91mbt03ohyw ) :(, 
  but you did say that any country that has a intelligence program can not complain about being spied on because that would be hypocritical . 
  and that 's just not a stance i can agree with . 
  if your country has a intelligence program with * limited rights * your country can and should complain . 
  and i think we are in a position where we should be happy about any opposition to the wholesale surveillance of the internet ( and our banking ) . 
  yet another `` spying is totaly normal and nobody is allowed to complain about it '' comment . 
  why are you guys in every thread about prism/tempora ? 
  can you not see that there is a difference in the amount of data being collected ? 
  and americans . 
  those freedom hating , spying idiots . 
  you really need to work on your reading skills if you think i said europe was in any way better . 
  thats elementary school stuff . 
  while the use of `` cis '' by srs has reduced the word 's impact , rmc 's criticism is still correct . 
  those `` strong individual liberties '' have not been guaranteed for many minorities in the last 200 years . 
  the usa as the beacon of justice and liberty is just a tall tale some people like to believe . 
  france and portugal too . 
  i bet she does n't even have a license for that !, 
  but beds are n't a good means of transportation either !, 
  oh i would n't say that i am very surprised about it , but i find the way many commentators from other countries react pretty insulting . 
  often belittling the german reaction and saying that the spying is something we should just accept , because every nation does it . 
  as if that makes it one iota better . 
  sitting back and saying that you do n't like whats happening , but still not doing nothing about it is not the right way to deal with this . 
  thats like sending a strongly worded letter to someone who burns your house down . 
  having stronger online privacy regulations is imho useless , as long as the breaching of those regulation by intelligence agencies is seen as an acceptable or even desired event . 
  i did n't post the article to bash america , but to see what other europeans think about it . 
  sorry but our minister of the interior said some days ago that 2 maybe more attacks have been stopped due to the american intel . 
  even if i was not opposed to foregoing privacy and freedom rights for the sake of security ( or feeling of security ) , i would say that compromising the whole it infrastructure of my country for that little gain is a very bad deal . 
  no because it 's does n't give me any additional information or proper food for thought . 
  it could just as well be written by a mouthpiece of the us government . 
  those articles rarely deviate from standard lines of thought ( i do n't mean to far from my ideological pov ) and scrutinise the accepted assumtions . 
  it 's one of the most tiring features of opinion pieces . 
  you often know whats in it after the first few sentences . 
  interesting . 
  i think that the article shows once again that reading nyt articles about germany written by americans is a complete waste of time . 
  yes , absolute numbers would be necessary to make the leap to higher consumption . 
   berlusconi 's party ( pdl ) freezes and does not start any crisis . 
  the reason why is very simple : bringing on the shitstorm solely because of berlusconi 's judicial problems would electorally kill the party ( making it official that it exists only for the sake of silvio 's private issues ) . 
  they have the chance to buy some time ( to make the public office ban effective a parliamentary vote is needed , and it is a matter of months ) , and they will use it . 
  i do n't know the italian political landscape very well , but do n't you think there could be someone in the pdl that sees this as a good opportunity to stab berlusconi in the back ? 
  would his conviction suffice as a reason to betray and replace him ? 
  what do you think is the likeliest outcome ?
