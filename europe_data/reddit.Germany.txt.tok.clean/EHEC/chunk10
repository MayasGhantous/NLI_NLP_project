  consumer spending has dropped to just 54 % of gdp , compared with 69 % in america and 65 % in britain . 
  exporters do not invest their windfall profits at home . 
  and germany is not alone ; sweden , switzerland , denmark and the netherlands have been piling up big surpluses , too . 
  for a large economy at full employment to run a current-account surplus in excess of 8 % of gdp puts unreasonable strain on the global trading system . 
  to offset such surpluses and sustain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work , the rest of the world must borrow and spend with equal abandon . 
  in some countries , notably italy , greece and spain , persistent deficits eventually led to crises . 
  their subsequent shift towards surplus came at a heavy cost . 
  the enduring savings glut in northern europe has made the adjustment needlessly painful . 
  in the high-inflation 1970s and 1980s germany 's penchant for high saving was a stabilising force . 
  now it is a drag on global growth and a target for protectionists such as mr trump . 
  ** the shift from thrift ** can the problem be fixed ? 
  perhaps germany 's bumper trade surplus will be eroded as china 's was , by a surge in wages . 
  unemployment is below 4 % and the working-age population will shrink , despite strong immigration . 
  after decades of decline , the cost of housing is rising , meaning that pay does not stretch as far as it used to . 
  the institutions behind wage restraint are losing influence . 
  the euro may surge . 
  yet the german instinct for caution is deeply rooted . 
  pay rose by just 2.3 % last year , more slowly than in the previous two years . 
  left to adjust , the surplus might take many years to fall to a sensible level . 
  the government should help by spending more . 
  germany 's structural budget balance has gone from a deficit of over 3 % of gdp in 2010 to a small surplus . 
  officials call this prudence but , given high private-sector savings , it is hard to defend . 
  germany has plenty of worthwhile projects to spend money on . 
  its school buildings and roads are crumbling , because of the squeeze on public investment required to meet its own misguided fiscal rules . 
  the economy lags behind in its readiness for digitalisation , ranking 25th in the world in average download speeds . 
  greater provision of after-school care by the state would let more mothers work full-time , in an economy where women 's participation is low . 
  some say such expansion is impossible , because of full employment . 
  yet in a market economy , there is a tried and trusted way to bid for scarce resources : pay more . 
  above all , it is long past time for germany to recognise that its excessive saving is a weakness . 
  mrs merkel is absolutely right to proclaim the message of free trade . 
  but she and her compatriots need to understand that germany 's surpluses are themselves a threat to free trade 's legitimacy .

  sure but the question is what comes after the current regime . 
  destabilizing a country through bombardment and arming of insurgents/rebels is not enough . 
  especially in a country like eritrea that is already suffering from religious divisions . 
  but only after the commissioners were nominated by the european governments . 
  the ep could elect the commission .

   there 's also the fact that modern people know that wars between major countries would be resolved through nukes , rather than boots on the ground .
