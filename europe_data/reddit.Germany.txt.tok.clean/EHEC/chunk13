  an interview with the deputy managing director of the german chamber of commerce in turkey , frank kaiser , was also printed . 
  but this has apparently never happened . 
  like kaisers superior , the managing director of the german chamber of commerce in istanbul , jan n\u00f6ther , told the faz , neither he nor kaiser had seen the text before its publication . 
  `` the interview has been published without our authorization . 
  it has never been given in this form and we have never released it for publication . '', 
  the chamber and its umbrella organization , the german chambers of industry and commerce ( dihk ) , heard of the interview from the newspaper . 
  `` that our good reputation is exploited by someone else without our knowledge goes too far , '' exclaimed n\u00f6ther . 
  `` we have to see what we can do about it . '', 
  kaiser is quoted as saying , `` there are many investment opportunities in turkey . 
  the potential of turkey is still far from being exhausted ... '' in addition , a portrait photo was included in the ad , which had been taken at a public event . 
  the author , who had supposedly conducted the interview , is unknown to kaiser . 
  parts of the text are apparently taken from a conversation which he had with the chamber of commerce of hamburg . 
  what particularly upsets n\u00f6ther : the alleged answer to the question of the legal status of the board was copied from an internal letter that n\u00f6ther had sent to the member companies . 
  the advertising campaign `` turkey - discover the potential '' was commissioned by the turkish ministry of economic affairs as well as the tim and tobb associations . 
  economic minister nihat zeybek\u00e7i was received by the federal government and economic representatives in berlin earlier this week . 
  he is notorious for his threat to the supposed turkish putschists in mid-july : `` they will die in two square meter holes like canal rats . '', 
  the advertising initiators have found almost two dozen international companies , including in the faz , which tout the country in videos and newspaper ads despite the dubious conditions in turkey . 
  the companies include nestl\u00e9 , sanofi , danone , vodafone , unilever , ford , general electric , fiat chrysler , toyota and samsung . 
  although the federal republic of germany is the most important economic partner and many companies have been asked to participate , no german corporations have so far taken part in the turkish government 's propaganda . 
  n\u00f6ther assumes that the interview was invented because of that : `` they are now using the chamber because the german companies are so reserved . '', 
  n\u00f6ther states that the statements in the interview are not wrong , because in fact turkey remains an interesting location . 
  `` but to advertise with our name , without asking us , is unacceptable . '', 
  a dihk spokesman appealed : `` this interview was neither conducted nor authorized . 
  the interview does not , however , contain any material errors . 
  in this respect , we believe it will not prove to be an irritation for the german industry . 
  `` the advertisement was ordered by the hamburg advertising agency mediafactor . 
  they do not feel responsible for the contents . 
  this is also the case with the responsible turkish employee of the international media partner global connection in istanbul . 
  a request for comments sent to the tim remained unanswered until the editorial deadline was reached .

  [ he got money and a place in a refugee shelter , though . 
  if he wanted to commit an attack with the gun himself , getting asylum would n't really change much since his identity would be easy to find out if he gets caught and if he does n't get caught the asylum application would n't even come up in the news . 
  true , but there are reports about shortages of interpreters and widespread technical difficulties with fingerprint scanners . 
  * he registered as a asylum seeker and was accepted * hid a pistol in a toilet at the vienna airport * was arrested when he tried to retrieve it ** 3 months ago ** * police searched 16 locations in france , austria and germany * they also arrested a university student in frankfurt the case highlights that the german bureaucracy is not capable of screening asylum applicants and the german army is not capable of weeding out xenophobic would be terrorists .
