  would the government break if berlusconi gets a harsh sentence ?

  and it 's easily the ugliest bmw i 've ever seen . 
  it looks a bit like a modernised version of the fiat multipla . 
  except if you 're on the losing side of a conflict . 
  we got a lot of information about the cold war ( vietnam , cuban missile crisis , glasnost , solidarnosc ) the holocaust and society during and after the 3rd reich , but very little about ww2 itself . 
  i think the history lessons were focussed about diplomacy & society instead of military history and learning dates by heart . 
  all in all one of my favourite subjects . 
   the interview was conducted by american cryptography expert jacob appelbaum and documentary filmmaker laura poitras with the help of encrypted e-mails shortly before snowden became known globally for his whistleblowing . 
  so the interview was given before he applied for asylum . 
  he lost control of the information way before he asked for asylum , so it 's not a part of the bargaining . 
  i doubt that the bnd is spying on german citizens . 
  it propably works like this : * the nsa and other foreign intelligence agencies spy on germany * the bnd spies on internet traffic that goes through germany or a foreign nation . 
  * germany gets the information from the nsa etc. 
  without official source status . 
  * everyone gets what they want without breaking laws in their own country . 
  everyone in the government is happy . 
  and that 's why i think that cfern 's comment is nonsense : i am not my government . 
  i 'm against data retention . 
  i do n't want to get spied on . 
  i do n't give a fuck who does it , as long as i 'm getting spied on i will be angry . 
  oh i know what polyamory is , but i 'm not really interested in discussing that because you wo n't get enough replies in this subreddit to get to any meaningful conclusion . 
  i really hope they use a nationalised gas and oil company to get as much money out of it as possible and use it to reform the country . 
  not really mislead , but the vote of the european parlament has very little weight . 
  the parlament has approved the resolution so the commission can now ahead if it wants to . 
  this does not mean that anything has to happen . 
  as far as i know thats how germany handles it . 
  when a state attorney learns of a crime a member of the parlament commited he asks the `` ausschuss f\u00fcr immunit\u00e4tsangelegenheiten '' ( commitee on immunity issues ) to revoke the immunity . 
  and afaik it 's more like a formality . 
  do you really think that the people who bugged offices came in with real identification ? 
  `` hello we 're your american cleaning team !, 
  we work for a nsa subcontractor and our operation will take 5 min max !, 
  thanks for letting us in . '', 
  our government has no interest in protecting our private communication against spying from the us or gb , because they share their findings with our government . 
  fulfilling the wet dream of the majority parties : full scale data retention . 
  most negative reactions against the spying nations will be because of the coming elections . 
  this is the reaction i expected : [ i see nothing !, 
  i was not here !, 
  i did not even get up this morning !,

  the woman was at a uni in colorado and the first guy went to a uni in california . 
  i guess studying in the us shows that you know enough english to get through the exams ( reading english text books ) . 
  games , torrents of american tv shows and english websites ( ~ two years before obama got elected ) . 
  i have to say my active vocabulary is only mediocre but i can comprehend most higher level english texts i come across . 
  using subbed instead of dubbed tv shows on public television would do so much for the pronunciation of ordinary germans . 
  but only if the companies that build for you are from your own country and since the government has to call for bids from all of europe to start the whole process that is not guaranteed . 
  well since meps and other european citizens have no say in the tax policy of ireland and ireland can use the tax money right now , we ca n't use that as leverage . 
  getting caught spying on foreign dignitaries ? 
  do all european countries use the same statistical method for reporting unemployment to eurostat ? 
  i read somewhere that the statistics from greece and spain were inflated . 
  i would n't be the least bit surprised to find out that the spying was tolerated and encouraged by our government . 
  the cdu has tryed for years to get surveillance laws passed . 
  nearly every time there is a report about terrorism the hardliners come out of their hidingholes to demand stricter laws and more surveillance . 
  [ highly informative segment about foreign life on earth ( worth watching to the end ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ze-j4aenqk ), 
  those scans have to be analysed , so there is still someone who can influence the whole process . 
  and i doubt the conclusiveness of those scans . 
  right now ? 
  sure . 
  but in a few weeks , when the protest wave has stopped , things will look different . 
  i think turkey can burry its hopes to join the eu . 
  in my opinion accession talk should be put on ice . 
  there is way too little the european community can do when a country falls behind the accession criteria after joining . 
  th whole process seems to be based on the naive idea that after fulfilling certain conditions there will be no way to fall back . 
  no , he should be on the winning side !, 
  but in some countries like germany asylum seekers are not allowed to work , when they enter the country . 
  you ca n't have it both ways - complaining about lazy asylum seekers and banning them from work . 
  there was a rightwing subreddit dedicated to manipulating / europe / politics and / worldnews a few months ago , but it went private after people noticed and most commenters thought it was to small to have any impact . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/ridf http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/xmymn/psa_reurope_is_the_the_target_of_a_propaganda/ but i 'm pretty sure the residents of / r/europe are capable of racism too . 
  looks like the mods have removed the link from the front page of r/europe, 
  both . 
  i think if the public ca n't talk about a problem in full detail , it will be hard to find a solution . 
  violence involving young immigrants is a problem throughout europe and omitting it is not going to help us find a way out of their ( and subsequently our ) misery . 
  it 's a euphemism for violent non integrated immigrants ( 1st 2nd 3rd generation ) . 
  another moron from r/niggers and r/whiterights . 
  banning antibiotics as growth promotors is only theoretical here in germany . 
  about 1.700 tons of antibiotics have been fed to lifestock every year . 
  because european solar panel producers are dying . 
  once the european competition has been weakend enough the chinese governement will reduce the subsidies and the prices will rise . 
  in the end the european solar panel industry will be severly weakend for the benefit of having a few years of cheap chinese panels . 
  you 're right !, 
  it was not my intention to make it seem like the csu politicians were the only ones , but due to the political dominance of the conservatives in bavaria the biggest names on the list were active csu members . 
  i should have mantioned that the former federal minister of family affairs renate schmitt ( spd ) - how fitting - employed a family member too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u19mvsyrvrc ), 
  * the fc bayern has reached the champions league final . 
  * the former player and president of the fc bayern uli hoene\u00df admitted to hiding millions of euros in swiss bank accounts and his lawyers are supposedly working on a deal with the state prosecutor . 
  * after a prominent constitutional expert published a new book * `` die selbstbediener . 
  wie bayerische politiker sich den staat zur beute machen '' * ** 79 current and former members of the bavarian parliament confessed the employment of frist degree family members . 
  ** the state misiter of justice , agriculture , culture , party whip of the conservative party and the head of the budget comittee are among them . 
  since our politicians are greedy assholes none of this was illegal . 
  but do n't expect any political change in bavaria , it 's not the first time something like this has happend . 
  france !, 
  that and the influx of more conservative people from southern germany . 
  [ he 's incredible !,

  the courts president admitted that the emails with the invitation were not sent at the same time . 
  the turkish newspaper that filed the complaint supposedly recieved the email 16 minuites too late . 
  and there is no reason to be annoyed - at least not for you . 
  the court had the opportunity to show a modicum of common sense and sensibility but instead it has given everyone even more cause to think that the german public does n't respect the victims .
