  favoring the newspapers that wrote about the `` halbmondmafia '' and `` d\u00f6nermorde '' while shutting out those from the country where 8 of the victims came from is not acceptable . 
  which would be truly unheard-of , right ? 
  [ you 're part of the problem . 
  piss off !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/19sz5h/two_hiv_patients_cured_the_boston_patients_xpost/c8raz3v ), 
  at least you did n't joke about train rides and going camping . 
  i guess he wo n't , since he 's just a troll . 
  wtf is up with greece ? 
  i 'd bet it will end like [ this one ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2011/06/14/chinese-builder-loses-showpiece-polish-highway-deal/ ) . 
  it will produce some radioactive waste , because some of the materials in the reactor will be activated by the radiation ( high energy neutrons turn stable nuclei into unstable ones ) . 
  but the half life of the radioactive material should be shorter so that the material does not have to be stored in a safe place for quite as long . 
  those countries might not be net contributors though . 
  i think everyone who is racist should be banned from reddit . 
  and i would say that the racist opinions in this sub are disproportionate . 
  mostly because reddit does not give mods proper tools to keep the racists under control and because the mods of / r/europe are too tolerant of racist opinions . 
  and just so this is clear : i wo n't show tolerance for the intolerant . 
  this has nothing to do with critical thinking or open-mindedness . 
  yes some countries have asylum as a constitutional right ( like article 16a in the german constitution ) , but a lot of politicians do n't want to have that right applied to frequently . 
  if you look into the history of this article you will find out how the conservatives have used right wing terror attacks in 1992 ( culminating in burning down a housing complex in rostock lichtenhaagen ) to force the tightening of asylum rights in the constitution . 
  some of the right wing posters in this sub insinuate that germany wants all the refugees it can get , the truth is of course different : * housing , feeding and caring for regugees is expensive ( but talk about welcoming refugees is cheap ) * the amount of refugees we could get might be astronomical and accepting refugees that came through the balkans is seen as good enough ( my guess ) . 
  * the public is already split on immigration ( but gladly not as much as some people in this sub believe ) and actively ferrying syrians to germany would probably exacerbate the situation for conservative parties . 
  ( one of the problems with merkel is that she is very good at gaining political capital but does not want to `` spend '' it ) morally it does n't make any sense to let the syrians die in the mediterranean sea , but i guess politically it does . 
  that is my opinion as a cynical person . 
   cucks you seem to have taken a wrong turn . 
  / pol is [ that way ] ( https://boards.4chan.org/pol/ ) . 
  keep dreaming that the `` silent majority '' is on the side of racism and hatred . 
  yup . 
  do you plan to leave the subreddit in its current state ? 
  with all the racism ? 
  do n't you think that would keep normal posters away from the ama and reflect poorly on us ? 
  yeah but you 're still too stupid to name the `` shared '' resources . 
  go back to / r/conspiracy , idiot . 
  go back to / r/conspiracy , idiot . 
  so you just want to sing the old `` the foreigners took our ... '' song without having any point to make ? 
   also keep in mind that the goal of the european union and the un at this point is to destroy current european societies . 
  conspiratard hogwash . 
  you do n't seem to understand that granting refugees asylum status is part of every eu countries sovereign rights . 
  another thing you do n't seem to understand is that asylum seekers that get a residence permit ( aufenthaltserlaubnis ) , are not allowed to work in other eu countries ( unlike eu citizens ) . 
  refugees that have already applied for asylum are not perceived as a burden to other eu countries outside of the country they seek to be granted asylum in . 
  so the analogy with california and other states does not work . 
  not granting asylum to syrians and not suspending the dublin rules would lead to more conflict with other eu countries that do n't want the refugees . 
  in conclusion : this is a way of dealing with refugees that reduces conflicts with neighboring countries ( unless you are of the opinion that these people should be sent back to syria or the bottom of the mediterranean sea ) . 
  hot ass !, 
  * journalism : remove all current public ( subsides by governments ) journalistic media and replace it with a new system . 
  there will be several layers of journalist groups who will be controlled by a - to be installed - '' critical analyses group '' . 
  an ** independent and unapproachable ** group which is capable of analysing the condition of our public journalism . 
  logicism , analyses , rhetorics and objectivity will be the main focus . 
  being unapproachable is a bad thing for any kind of oversight committee , especially when it comes to a newly implemented system that controls all subsidized media . 
  * immigration : complete halt for the coming years . 
  this halt will apply for the entire african continent and arabia . 
  so you just want to let them rot in countries governed by terror regimes ( eritrea ) or civil war ( sudan , afghanistan , syria etc. ) ? 
  if that 's your opinion i can imagine what kind of right wing crap the media in your dream country would televise . 
  * communication : increase the usage of the english language continentwide . 
  implement studying english at lower school , discourage usage of synchronization in particular languages , et cetera . 
  not that bad . 
  * illness and health : reshape our medical thinking . 
  acknowledge the importance of food ( minerals ) and the abuse of medicines . 
  less '' i study medcine '' and more '' i study the human body '' . 
  healthy eating and a regular fitness routine is important for the well being of our body and mind , but studying medicine includes studying the human body as well as the use of drugs to influence it . 
  there is no need to split the two up . 
  looking into prescription drug abuse would be a good idea though . 
  * changing world : install an ** independent thinktank ** which will concern itself with the influence of technologies . 
  the likely influence robotics , ai , online living , dna-manipulation should be properly analysed . 
  ** the population should be well informed ** and should , via a democratic process , be allowed to intervene . 
  we already have a multitude of independent think tanks . 
  keep them seperate , peer reviewed and give scientific working groups more input in political discussions ( instead of the church ) . 
  i do n't think the public will ever have the adequate level of information to make a sensible decision in a referendum . 
  * banks : reduce banks to what they once were : savekeepers of money - and nothing more . 
  banks will not be allowed to hold more then x % of clients . 
  having banks as credit institution is a fundamental part of your economical system . 
  removing credit institutions would cripple it beyond repair . 
  increasing control and creating a system of clear and binding responsibilities would be better . 
  * corporations : more restrictions . 
  no ttip . 
  no backdoor lobbying . 
  again , an independent group will oversee all transactions and business done . 
  lobbying will be allowed but will be monitored . 
  what do you mean when you say independent ? 
  and what is your definition of lobbying ? 
  what about politicians getting lucrative jobs in industries that they deregulated after getting out of the world of politics ? 
  * politicians : will be monitored by an independent group : '' democracy savekeepers '' . 
  they will give up their privacy to ensure their loyalty ( independence of corperations ) . 
  your system of independent watchmen is a problem . 
  who watches the watchmen ? 
  * automatisation : corporations will see an increase of taxes equally over all of europe due to increasing automatisation . 
  corporations fleeing europe will not be allowed to have europe as a market . 
  usage of european patents , public discoveries/science , will be punished . 
  by actual force if needed . 
  i do n't like using force but in a world where increasing automation increases the wealth of the top few instead of the utopia that was promised ( no one will have to work for their food etc. ), 
  a fairer system is necessary . 
  * global warming/environment : increase research of alternative energysources by 50 % . 
  not bad . 
  but a lot of the technology is already there 8but not yet cheap enough to be completely competitively viable . 
  especially as long as the effects of conventional energy production are not included in the prices ( pollution from coal power plants , storage of nuclear waste , deconstruction of nuclear power plants etc. ) . 
  reducing red tape ( like distance laws for wind turbines , faster power grid expansion etc. ), 
  is needed . 
  * european army : increase spending . 
  decrease dependence of the usa . 
  coordinate spending between nation states . 
  can not work without a unified foreign policy .
