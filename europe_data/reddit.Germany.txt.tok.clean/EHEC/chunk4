  * freedom of religion : this law will be removed . 
  the freedom to practice religious believes is already constituted in the freedom of speech and freedom of gathering . 
  as it stands now ` freedom of religion ' is nothing more then ` status special ' to obtain more freedom ( and wealth via subsidations ) than non-religious believes . 
  i think reducing the special rights of religious institutions would be a great thing ( especially here in germany ) but removing the freedom of religion is not necessary . 
  * law : courtsystems and judges will be monitored and its sayings will be noted as void if in conflict with actual law . 
  just nooooooooooo . 
  * remove kingdoms across europe . 
  slowly . 
  one by one . 
  let the people decide . 
  but i frankly do n't care that much . 
  * switzerland : sanction and encircle . 
  they will no longer be a safe haven for criminals ( tax evaders ) their money . 
  not the only country with a problematic banking system . 
  creating a unified front against them all is more important than singling out switzerland . 
  * africa : regain ( military ) influence and control of resources . 
  ensure the survival of africa 's nature . 
  sounds like you want to recolonize africa . 
  noooo . 
  * usa : reshape the relationship . 
  more balance , less depedence , but acknownledge the importance of the usa being europe 's primary ally . 
  we will have to make clear that america , like europe , will have to rid itself of corporate / influence . 
  very hard to do without more unification in europe . 
  * israel : decrease its influence/power . 
  sanctions , intervention and/or ( military ) aid to palestine . 
  i disagree . 
  * syria , lybia , iraq et cetera : destroy is by massive bombingcampaigns . 
  reinstall secular orders controlled by the us and europe . 
  bombing stuff is easy compared to building a unified , friendly and open society . 
  does that include indefinite stationing of troops in these countries ? 
  * ukraine : install abmc 's or patriots on the current border of north-ukraine . 
  russia shall not pass . 
  same protection applies to the baltics , et cetera . 
  what do you do when russia increases its pressure on ukraine / baltic countries ? 
  it is in the nature of oversight groups to become the plaything of interest groups . 
  i am not really convinced that your system would not turn dictatorial or corrupt . 
  i would not vote for you ( also because your immigration policy is to far to the right for me ) . 
  thanks , 
  you could edit your post to reflect that the information was n't accurate . 
  paranoid ? 
  another way to deal with it is to heavily moderate the sub instead of letting everyone who does n't outright call for murder of immigrants pass . 
  i find it hard to believe you . 
  there are soooo many `` auntie ... '' accounts that mysteriously all support right wing ideas ( like you ) . 
  hahahahahaah . 
  you know what happend after the charlie hebdo attack ? 
  newspapers reprinted the cartoons with mohammed . 
  if you include the third reich it 's tens of millions . 
  but the linked article is about the last 25 years ( so since the fall of the gdr ) . 
  it 's not nearly that bad here . 
  you can facilitate change in the same way all the other people do in germany : * vote for parties that support your ideas about immigration rules . 
  if that party is the npd you will have to live with the fact that you might be called a nazi . 
  * join a party that supports your ideas . 
  or join one to change it from within . 
  you will have to live with the fact that people will call you a nazi if you espouse nazi ideology or that you might get kicked out of existing parties . 
  * demonstrate against what you find unjust . 
  as long as you do n't throw stones , hurt people , damage property or use hate speech , the police wo n't do anything . 
  and even if you use violence , the police in saxony does n't give a fuck . 
  they probably wo n't arrest you . 
  you have the same democratic tools a your fingertips as all the other germans . 
  a nazi youtube channel as a source ... 
   oftentimes i 'm more worried about the social cleavage and rise of extremism because of the migrants more than the actual migrants . 
  the rise of extremism is not due to the immigrants though . 
  it has more to do with the lack of jobs , a percieved lack of political influence , support of far right groups through inaction of the police and a lack of education . 
  the most xenophobic regions of germany are those with the least immigrants . 
  we ca n't have a discussion as long as half the comments about refugees condone arson , islamophobia , xenophobia a feeling of unwarranted cultural/religious superiority . 
  in the last year this sub has become a cesspit of rightwing alt accounts ( often less than a month old ) . 
  even though i have a nuanced view on immigration subtopics , i wo n't waste my time with writing several paragraphs defending refugees , because short xenophobic blurts ( e.g. 
  if the politicians do n't listen to the germans , burning refugee homes is a-okay . '' ), 
  will get much more upvotes . 
  oh look another 1 day old nazi account !, 
  apparently we are still extremely racist here in germany . 
  this sub is doomed . 
  to the shower with you !, 
  i do n't think it was tongue in cheek . 
  thorsten albig ( pm of schleswig-holstein said : `` i think she does an excellent job - she 's a good chancellor . '', 
  i think many higher ups in the spd would like to remain in the role of the junior partner to the cdu . 
  changing their party lineup and program enough to be seen as a viable alternative to merkel while being in the governing coalition is a very difficult task . 
  i guess that the spd will stay in the grand coalition and continue to wither away . 
  [ source for the quote and an article about the spd ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-07/torsten-albig-kanzlerkandidat-spd-sigmar-gabriel ), 
  + ** cdu/csu = union ** : is the major political force in germany since 2005 . 
  though describing them as a force might imply more action on their part than actually was . 
  has moved to the left on many issues . 
  supposedly merkel relies heavily on telephone polls when she has to find a political stance . 
  in the left spectrum she is considered to be a calculating and opportunist flip-flopper . 
  in her rise to power she has eviscerated opposition in her party and there is some doubt whether there is a designated successor after merkel is gone . 
  with the weakness of the spd there can be no doubt who will win the next elections . 
  both the cdu and csu have been at the center of massive corruption scandals in the past ( [ a big donation scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal ) , [ lockheed bribery scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_bribery_scandals ) , and plenty more ) . 
  on the federal level center-right , in some states ( bavaria , baden-w\u00fcrtemberg ) right wing . 
  more concerned with maintaining the status quo ( or at least the appearance of it ) pro : privatization , lower taxes for the rich and companies , mass surveillance . 
  anti : immigration ( mostly on the state level ) , equality for gsm , drug law liberalization , renewable energy ( mostly on the state level , but very unenthusiastic about change in the energy sector ) , environmentalism + ** spd ** : center party , purports to be leftist . 
  some part of the divided german left consider them traitorous , especially since the early 2000s , when a spd/greens coalition introduced the `` agenda 2010 '' , which made deep cuts to benefits and welfare . 
  the spd has shrunk from ~ 35 % election results in the 90s to ~ 25 % in the last two elections and lost about 450000 of their 900000 members since 1990 . 
  they have no chance of getting out of that misery if they do n't return to their former leftist positions or find another way to clearly distinguish themselves from the cdu ( currently they are nearly a carbon copy of it ) . 
  the spd has been in coalitions with the greens , but their share of seats would not be enough to from a government today . 
  forming a broad leftist coalition with the greens and die linke could be one way out , but the spd categorically refuses to form a coalition with die linke , supposedly because the spd sees die linke as the successor organization of the sed ( dictatorial party in the gdr ) . 
  i think the spd does n't want to legitimize die linke , because they fear losing votes ( ignoring that this is already the case ) . 
  possible differences between the cdu and spd : pretends to be for : immigrant rights , increase the number of daycare facilities , health care reform , renewable energy , gay marriage . 
  + ** greens ** : i ca n't give you a honest opinion about them without getting depression . 
  + ** fdp ** : formerly a social-liberal and economic-liberal party . 
  the fdp has mostly given up on the social-liberalism in favor of a more hardline economic-liberal stance .
