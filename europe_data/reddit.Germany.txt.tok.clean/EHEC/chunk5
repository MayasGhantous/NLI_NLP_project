  look at the economic policies of the republicans an you have the party platform of the fdp . 
  all other parts of the party program are better thought of as poker chips for coalition talks . 
  the fdp was kicked out of the parliament in the last elections and currently below the 5 % hurdle in the polls . 
  + ** die linke ** : far left . 
  split internally between the western and eastern parts of the party . 
  the eastern part of the party is somewhat stuck in hopeless leftist idealism and anti-american / pro-russian idiocy . 
  the western part of the party brings up painful subjects that the other parties would rather like to ignore . 
  the party as a whole has a simplistic world view , too many believers of conspiracy theories and is generally very hostile towards the other parties . 
  + ** pirate party ** : became heavily fractured soon after its conception . 
  is and will continue to be irrelevant in germany . 
  shit journalism from both of them . 
   still not as deadly as malaria . 
  can you give me a source for that ? 
  i know that preventing malaria is very hard , but we should not deminish the incredible successes that medical and biological research has brought us : eradicating one of the deadliest viruses in the history of mankind and making tb a curable disease . 
  yeah , very funny how she was brutally murdered and fulfilled her destiny . 
   malaria is probably the most deadly disease ever to have existed . 
  what about smallpox or tb ? 
  but they lower your body temperature if you 're sweating . 
  i wish we had ac in our flat . 
  we keep the windows open in the night and close the windows / rolling shutters in the early morning . 
  after a few days of heat you feel like a cave troll . 
  i say : bring me all the air-conditioning you have !, 
  i was in ireland in june .

  `` i knocked him away . 
  with prohibited entry ( to germany ) . 
  i stuck my finger in his nose . 
  and he choked . 
  and i dragged him by the foot shackles through the station . 
  it was great . 
  he squealed like a pig . 
  it was a gift from allah . '', 
  in the second incident , which occurred in september , police arrested a 19-year-old moroccan who was in the country legally after he failed to show a ticket on a regional train . 
  the man was also taken to the station 's police department , where he was tormented , ndr reports . 
  '' ( an officer ) heard him squeal like a pig , '' another whatsapp message reportedly read . 
  `` then the bastard gobbled up the rotten pork leftovers in the refrigerator . 
  off the floor . '', 
  he would have made a great guardsman in a concentration camp . 
  i have no respect for or trust in the police .

  reintroducing slavery ? 
  is there a reason this antisemite is n't banned from / r/europe ? 
  the rote armee fraktion ( red army faction ) was a leftist terror group in the 1970s , 80s and 90s . 
  they commited more than 30 murders . 
   if that 's what bavarians want . 
  apparently we do n't want full independence : [ poll in german . 
   the judges ruled that troops could be mobilized only in `` states of emergency of ** catastrophic proportions ** , '' but never `` in reaction to the threat posed by demonstrating crowds . '', 
  no specifications . 
  i expect another law suit in about 5 years . 
  looks like it . 
  op is a mod in [ / whiterights ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/whiterights/ ), 
   obama actually had a democrat-controlled senate and congress his first two years in office . 
  you know that the senate does not work like that right ? 
  i can already smell the state elections in bavaria . 
  much populism will be served . 
  whatever flag you 're flying , you 'll be the cave troll in my heart . 
  but only if they bring a teddy bear as a gift . 
  except that this bazooka would n't solve the underlying problems . 
  [ austrian central alps last year . 
  yes , but they benefit the most from overhang mandates . 
  right now the union has 24 additional seats in the bundestag because of them . 
  merkel does n't want to give up her advantage , even though it was deemed unconstitutional . 
  a bit more information [ form deutsche welle .

  same as rim apparently . 
  their minimum wage is far lower than hartz iv . 
  i 'd say there 's also a considerable amount of distrust . 
  people do n't think , that : + politicians will make decisions in the best interest of the people . 
  + neighbouring countries want to / can run safe nuclear power plants ( temelin , fessenheim , some old npps in switzerland ) . 
  + companies will actually obey the safety regulations . 
  + the emergency plans are sufficient . 
  considering the way governments have handled nuclear accidents in the past , i think some of the concerns are valid . 
   this same neutrality prevents german state from offering quotas based on gender not true . 
  for some government jobs women will be prefered . 
  but only as long as women are underrepresented in the department and the qualifications are similar to those of the competitor .

  hey switzerland !,

  if you are form switzerland , why would you care ? 
  just curious . 
   the `` debt crisis '' is n't about the level of debt a country has per se , it is about their ability to pay back that debt . 
  not really . 
  as long as you can pay the interest for the government debt and markets are willing to lend you money , you can cover your old debt with new debt . 
  and since the interest rates for german 10 year bonds are much lower than the ones for spain , italy and greece , the effect on the yearly budget is less severe . 
  i do n't have a problem with the other states , but berlin behaves like a teenager with daddy 's credit card . 
  they are 64 billion $ in debt , recieve 3 billion from other states / the federal level and what do they do ? 
  rebuild the city palace for more than 500 million . 
  while scoring worse than any other state in the latest education study . 
  is there any other source for this ? 
  claiming foreign territory can be deadly for accession negotiations . 
  goddamn sheep shaggers !,
