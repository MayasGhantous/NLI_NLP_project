  [ the original of our modern anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06643umejzg ) was written by joseph haydn for his emperor franz i ( first emperor of austria ) . 
  the secret bavarian state anthem : [ bayrischer defiliermarsch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poluxjsq3zk ), 
  i would say the increased drone use fits right in . 
  instead of sending regular troops to deal with terrorists , obama opted for a strategy that avoids american deaths at the cost of more `` colleteral damage '' . 
  deploying and losing soldiers in yet another country would make his reelection much more difficult . 
  maybe he did it solely to save his soldiers lives , maybe not . 
  following the initial letdown after obama was elected , most people realised that the democrats lack the resolve , courage and unity to fix things . 
  the news pay more attention to elections in the us than in france . 
  i 'd say there are to sides : religious nutjobs with corporate backing and meek slackers with corporate backing . 
  since the perceived divide between the parties is much more sizeable than here , you get a lot of news attracting drama . 
  but being a big trade partner plays a large role , too ( mostly for playing the guilt game at the moment ) . 
  http://www.ehrenhauser.at/assets/acta-rollcall.pdf there you go . 
  acta died because it was unpopular among the european citizens . 
  if they can keep down publicity during the next try , they 'll suceed . 
  i guess the content will be split up and brought back without a huge treaty . 
  this wo n't be dropped , as long as lobbyism is legal in brussels/strasbourg . 
  and which team do you favour ? 
  when you look around on reddit you will find that some americans will say that they are not in a relationship and exclusive despite beeing de facto exclusive and emotionally bound to one person . 
  i know that it 's common to have a conversation about relationship status at some point . 
  how does that work in your county ? 
  do people assume exclusivity at some point ? 
  is the fact that you 've been on dates and in bed together and you 're emotionally attached to that person enough to say that you 're in a relationship ? 
  do you plan to go to public screenings or screenings with friends ? 
  any bets or drinking games with friends ? 
  or more effective to blow up a lorry full of explosives in a market or in front of a mosque . 
  really ? 
  i only heard about americans using coke for cooking . 
  or the `` traditional '' family horst seehofer has . 
  is the tower in the background a former flak tower ? 
  they do n't . 
  me guess is that a european court will decide that the tax benefits are not legal , the german government will cut them and act like it did n't know that this woud happen . 
  nice way of scapegoating the eu and increasing the budget . 
  and not getting enough children . 
  you do n't have to be white to be a right wing terrorist and you do n't have to be arab to be an islamist terrorist . 
  thanks . 
  even though bullying in his teens played a role in for his motivation he was obsessed with being aryan and being superior because of that . 
  i 'd say it was a mix between far right ideology ( racial superiority ) and a ` regular ' amok run . 
  because europe is facing a more aggressive russia and the usa is openly questioning nato . 
  it happened * yesterday * . 
  a few weeks ago a guy in heidelberg ran down a pensioner and tried to attack the police with a knife . 
  but he did n't have a ideological motivation as far as the police knows . 
  you have to make sure that it was actually a terrorist and not just a mentally disturbed person .

  yup , they 'd have to quintuple their poll numbers to gain power since no one wants to form a coalition with them . 
  both le pen and afd is very unlikely, 
  modern hosters have safety mechanisms ( level 2 and 3 holsters ) that prevent that .

  a lot of the coutries in southern europe are still susceptible to financial disaster . 
  the next financial crisis might be triggered by trouble in the usa ( like student loans ) or china ( shadow banks ) .
