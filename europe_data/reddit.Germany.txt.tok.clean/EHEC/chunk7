  it 's probably not as secular as you thought especially in the south of germany . 
  but the support for same sex marriage and adoption rights is still pretty high ( 65-80 % depending on the survey you trust ) . 
  it 's just that the campaigning for equal rights has died down a lot . 
  that sounds * interesting * in german . 
  you 'll definitely meet some tourists though . 
  i guess people see the immigrants from turkey and their families as more conservative/strict than the turks that live in istanbul . 
  the reason i do n't like the glorification of stauffenberg is that the resistance in the military was not primarily motivated by the suffering the german military had unleashed over europe but the influence hitler and his dilettantism had in the german armed forces and the negative effects the war would have on germany . 
  the military resistance contained massive antisemites and people that were directly responsible for mass executions ( like arthur nebe who was cammander of einsatzgruppe b ) . 
  the resistance in the military was plagued by overly complex plans which could be derail by unfortunate events ( hitler leaving early , bombs not going off etc. ) . 
  instead of one person with access giving up his own life in a suicide attack they tried their plots without success . 
  i would n't trust another country with that considering how badly nuclear waste was dealt with in the past ( and well its russia ) .

  as farsfedeferie said :  so russia can just occupy any territory , fill it with russians , and then call it their own ? 
  careful , the umayyads might swoop in . 
  not really an alleged nazi since he sees the protocols of the elders of zion as a real document , wrote that the jews brought about their own demise and believes that convicted holocaust deniers are mere dissidents . 
  his books are just dripping with antisemitism . 
  and yet the afd parliamentary group in badenw\u00fcrttemberg did n't want to kick him out of the party . 
  yeah crazy shit like ` soros was a jewish nazi collaborator who stole from other jews that were sent to auschwitz ',

  goddamn warmongering french !, 
  wagenknecht had that position way before the new sanctions were announced . 
  but the eu is a free trade area . 
  taxation is of course not a eu power but the rest of the eu did n't agree to that abysmally low tax rate . 
  it is a eu policy question too . 
  i think in some way it will become reality but not in terms of getting a monthly sum of money in your bank account but more like a steady stream of groceries , heat , and housing on the far off future . 
  when technology and ai are advanced enough to provide us with our daily and basic needs it wo n't be far off in europe or so i hope . 
  but until then basic income sounds like a liberal ( in the european sense ) scheme of reducing social security and pension expenses of the state to reduce taxes for the rich . 
  it 's moving away from ` from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs ' . 
  complying with this race to the bottom will just hurt everyone in the eu . 
  no it does n't make sense . 
  companies should pay their taxes where they do their business . 
  danko 's party is in a coalition agreement with 3 other parties . 
  the coalition lead by robert fico has a majority in the national council ( slovak parliament ) . 
  danko is unhappy with the coalition agreement made after the elections last year and wants to renegotiate . 
  which means it 's a shit definition . 
  by that measure nazi germany was the greatest country of europe for a while . 
  sending in their airforce would mean an end to the russian denial of direct involvement .

   in august 1944 , rumkowski and his family joined the last transport to auschwitz , [ 2 ] and were murdered there on august 28 , 1944 by the jewish sonderkommando inmates who beat him to death as revenge for his role in the holocaust . 
  this account of his final moments is confirmed by witness testimonies of the frankfurt auschwitz trials .

  most of the fighting that involves sdf , where most of the westerners are , will most likely be over soon unless turkey invades .

  the usa is the largest producer of natural gas in the world and in the past ~ 10 years the industry has been gearing towards more international trade since the ng prices fell . 
  it just looks very disingenuous when one of the main competitors proposes drastic sanctions on russian gas ( an industry the usa unlike germany is not dependent at all ) .
