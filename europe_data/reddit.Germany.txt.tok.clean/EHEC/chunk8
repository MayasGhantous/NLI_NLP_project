  that the conservative government did n't want the energiewende to succeed .

  a part of it is certainly the yearning for past relevance of the underemployed population in eastern germany . 
  same thing you can see in russia . 
  the sanctions do n't bring the swift downfall of putin because the people feel relevant with a strong leader that antagonizes the west .

   as more - these instructions are outdated because they were unvoted by our president today . 
  he did sign the ` reform ' of the common courts . 
  which undermines the judiciary for the absolute majority of court cases .

   how did it work for those who were hanged ? 
  most of them died . 
  why did they deserve to be hanged ? 
  because they started a war of aggression or were active parts of a genocidal organization . 
  you do know that the death penalty is abolished in the eu ? 
  and how minors are supposed to be treated ?
