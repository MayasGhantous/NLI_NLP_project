  opt-outs were created when the union was a smaller club , it does n't make you a higher country that stands above others or the laws and rules of the union . 
  ( how would you justify that anyway ? ), 
  the parasite was towards such a dismissive reaction for opt-outing if something does n't give direct benefits to you . 
  what 's so controversial about a common immigration policy anyway ? 
  right now every country makes their own laws , but it effects the whole union . 
  rosamunde pilcher is not german ? 
  o_o that name is so ridicilious german and she is very known here . 
  well that 's a sumg attitude , but no , you are n't a special snowflake . 
  a pick-and-choose union does not work . 
  if you are in , you have play by all the rules and not act like a parasite and only take part if things directly benefit you . 
  you would n't be allowed to opt out . 
   so i 'm backwards , because i come from a religious community and belive in god ? 
  yes . 
   yet spain wo n't allow catalonia to have an independence referendum . 
  what has that to do with it ? 
  it may not be what the catalans want , but the spanish goverment is acting lawful and democratic in this question . 
  no , stop this bullshit . 
  deal the same with these ethnic germans salafists . 
  if anything they are even worse . 
   germany : 66 % for , 42 % against , 10 % do n't know was this poll done by russians by any chance ? 
  why would you use * verboten * as loanword anyway ? 
  you already have * forbidden * . 
  any context to this ? 
  now imagine they actually live among you and not in some distant countries . 
  and i think even the when is clear . 
  once the goverment is n't lead by the cdu anymore , since virtually every other party is for it . 
  was n't me . 
  it 's embarassing that we still are n't dark blue . 
  as usual . 
  please tell me how much public support the ideas of these intellectuals and civil liberties fighters had at the only free democratic vote in the ddr . 
  yeah ... 
  to clarify , the ddr lasted another year . 
  the fall of the berlin wall happended 1 month after this ( on the 9th november 1989 ) which is the more meaningful date and symbol for the reunification . 
  no , you are correct , luxembourgish is a german dialect . 
  the line can be fussy but it 's arguably closer to standard german than austro-bavarian for example . 
  it 's a purely political matter . 
  bad experiences from the occupation time in the world wars caused people to want to distance themselves from germany and being german . 
  you can already see it in the international name of the country : it 's luxembourg , not luxemburg . 
  i think it 's a bit more complicated because of the situation in the kosovo . 
  the eu will likely only accept them at the same time so that one ca n't block the other from entering . 
  matte is mat in german aswell . 
  however in german it 's mathematik ( singular ) . 
  yes . 
  this is a map from the 21th century , polen . 
  did you choose the croatian flair by accident ? 
  estonia big, 
  implying germany is not prussia . 
  just look at the uniform of the highest representatives of our country . 
  the national football team . 
  i bet hamburg rolls right of their tongue ... 
  east frisia is ostfriesland . 
  if it would be about the name eu , then i could n't count 1987 either ... 
  they applied for an association agreement ( and were granted it since then ) in 1959 , not for membership . 
  can we please stop with this myth ? 
  they are appliying for membership since 1987 . 
  it 's a very long time but not 55 years . 
   for example , if turkey joined the eu , they would suddenly be the most powerful bloc in the european parliament . 
  ( representation by population ) at least for now we still have more people . 
  no many cares about that because it 's basically just an extended part of greece ( and turkey ) . 
  there 's also france which has land in south america and we do n't argue to kick it out . 
  totally agree with this . 
  i think most people would welcome the more progressive and actual geographic european part of turkey in the eu . 
  but i do n't think there is a chance of turkey splitting . 
  you are aware that not all of turkey is on that map ? 
  how is the political position of latvians towards the russian minority ? 
  you are the baltic state with the highest russian population and had you been 1 more generation in the soviet union you would have become a minority in your own country , right ? 
  and what about the russian minority ? 
  i read about the problem of statelessness . 
  people that did n't qualify for latvian citizienship but also do n't wan na take russian one because then they could n't stay/work in latvia . 
  would you say they are rather assimilated and feel as latvian people or are nostalgic and want latvia be reattached to russia ? 
  the north ( west ) is rather socialistic , the south conservative . 
  the far left ( which is the successor of the former ruling communist party of east germany ) is only really succesful in the east where it ranges around 20 % , in the west just around 5 % . 
  the east is also more open to populistic or far right parties and only there did the neo-nazi party manage to come into the parlament in 2 states ( now only 1 after recent elections ) . 
  from the last federal election , 2013 : [ socialist ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/btw13_spd_zweit_endgueltig.svg/422px-btw13_spd_zweit_endgueltig.svg.png ) [ conservative ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/btw13_cdu_zweit_endgueltig.svg/422px-btw13_cdu_zweit_endgueltig.svg.png ) [ far left ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/btw13_linke_zweit_endgueltig.svg/422px-btw13_linke_zweit_endgueltig.svg.png ), 
  ghost of german empire alive !, 
  poland a best poland . 
   white  ~ ~ asian ~ ~ yellow  black  ~ ~ mixed ~ ~ brown better ? 
  the reference he may or may not make is that 300 years ago the king of hanover ascended the british throne and from 1714 to 1837 great britain / united kingdom was ruled in personal union with the kingdom of hanover . 
  very relevant : [ die partei 's improvement of a poster from the npd ( neo-nazis ) by including haider ] ( http://bleib-passiv.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/die-partei_npd_gas-geben_j%c3%b6rg-haider.jpeg ) - [ \\ ( original image \\ ) ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01970/gas-220_1970646f.jpg ) for the non-germans : `` gas geben '' literally to give gas means to accelerate , but it 's obviously also a reference to another event that involved a lot of gas ... 
  ultimatively it is clear that no matter how advanced the technology is , the chance of an accident will be above 0 , even if it 's just 1 * 10 ^ -50 . 
  and if you say any chance of possible accident is unacceptable then there exists no answer . 
  but would you react the same way in another scenario ? 
  every year thousands of people die from car accidents . 
  do you think it would be a sensible solution to outlaw cars and force everyone to go by foot or bycycle ? 
  think about it , we could save thousands of lifes !, 
  we will see . 
  i do n't think russia has ever tried that on us , i think someone said even during the cold war they were a relieable supply partner . 
  russia may pull this shit with smaller states , but germany 's gdp is more than 1.5 times that of russia . 
  we may be dependent on their gas but they also depend on our money . 
  i know putin likes to play divide and conquer but aslong the eu and us stay together any sanctions or cut-off will hit russia multiple times as hard than us . 
  but it 's more than this , the anti-nuclear stance is something deeply integrated in the german public and many people feel very strongly about it . 
  from personal expirience i know it 's fruitless to discuss a pro-nuclear stance with most people . 
  any argument is countered by `` what if another tschernobyl happens ? '', 
  politicans can sometimes take unpopular decisions but this time there was simply no way to ignore the public . 
  if you had held a referendum i 'm positive you had 80 % + voting for anti-nuclear . 
  ja , we are very responsible .

  the german public has an irrational fear of anything that involves the word nuclear . 
  after fukushima all hell broke loose and our conservative government ( that originally prolonged the lifetime of our nuclear plants ) was basically forced to act unless they wanted to lose a huge chunk of votes . 
  half of the nuclear plants were directly shut down in 2011 , the other in ettapes until 2022 .
