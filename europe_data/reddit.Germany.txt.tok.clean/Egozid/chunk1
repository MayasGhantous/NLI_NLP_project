her it 's, 
  well , that 's embarrassing . 
  we obviously did n't work hard enough for it . 
  * flagellates self *, 
  it 's partly because it 's always the same contries who vote for russia , meaning it 's kinda like a political vote . 
  of course this goes for other european countries too . 
  what 's a do point . 
  what guy ? 
  you mean the second voice ? 
  a girl from austria said when germans talk it sounds like someone broke their jaw, 
  we 're kinda paranoid : http://i.imgur.com/rsqxrmw.jpg these are traditional german half-timbered houses : http://tiny.cc/uzol1w http://tiny.cc/f0ol1w and then there 's , i do n't know ... plattenbau : http://tiny.cc/43ol1w, 
  you ca n't make up for the bullshit that happened during ww2 , but looted art can be given back . 
  in my opinion this is about being civilized . 
  i do not understand how someone can be proud of owning looted art anyway . 
  it may be yours now , but you did not create it . 
  so russia is basically showing people what a great artist their former enemy was . 
  weird . 
  that dance seems familiar . 
  i feel the same about this . 
  you do n't have to be a nationalist to be bothered by seeing your country torn apart like that . 
  `` and here is an interesting example of how much more advanced a certain part of germany is compared to the rest of europe . '', 
  they bombed the shit out of dresden just say it . 
  let it out . 
  that 's one of the dumbest things i read in a long time . 
  what does one thing have to do with the other ? 
  they are politicians , not teachers . 
  and his english was just fine . 
  then why are you pointing it out ? 
  yea your post makes me cringe . 
  [ yay . 
  because it 's a stupid question . 
  and if you think that i was asking stupid questions then just tell me . 
  why are you an idiot ? 
  are there jews here on / r/europe who feel insulted by that ? 
  i 'm just curious . 
  you always here some officials say that something is supposed to be insulting for the jews , but i think most jews do n't actually get insulted that easily . 
  i miss getting rickrolled . 
  sometimes i think germany needs an arrogant ass . 
  hey it can be pretty delicious , if done right . 
  in my opinion banning things is the dumbest way of fighting extremism . 
  it 's like deleting racist comments for example . 
  you just keep people away from reading it , but nothing really changed . 
  people do n't get the chance to argue and the person who wrote the comment will only feel mistreated . 
  i think it 's important that the npd exists and that there are `` no '' people who vote for them . 
  the people who want to ban the npd are just adding fuel to the fire . 
  if i was a member of the npd or if i 'd be sympathetic to the npd , what would keep me away from taking to the streets ? 
  yes , that is exactly what happened . 
  i wonder why noone ever came to that conclusion before . 
  it should be mentioned in every article about germany 's current politics . 
  [ rome ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lmczdho2uy ) from luxembourg and [ : of the wand & the moon  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0xpgpgy3le ) from denmark . 
  everyone would be shitting rainbows, 
  i tried thinking of a proper response , but ... fucking what ? 
  what 's your problem ? 
  this is the most effective german satire in a long time and you have to complain about fees . 
  sorry , but ' `` oskar schindler '' of the balkans ' made me laugh . 
  i know it 's easier to explain it that way , but in the end we 're talking about individuals . 
  it 's good to know though . 
   assigning a non-zero probability to the existence of god does not mean you have to be an agnostic instead of an atheist . 
  sounds to me like most atheists get it wrong . 
  i consider myself agnostic , but maybe i do have some problems with the definition . 
  on the other hand , i think most atheists here have the same problems with the definitions . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of them consider themselves atheists , because they say `` i do n't believe in god '' , right ? 
  and when an atheist says agnostics are basically atheists , it seems to me like they 're just saying : `` you ca n't not know , you just did n't give it enough thought . '', 
  but they 're black , they must be tribesmen, 
  not really . 
  but i have no clue . 
   [ except germany ] ( http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1500/1500_northwest.jpg ), 
  please stay with us , bavaria . 
  * crossing fingers *, 
  no thanks . 
  speeches are n't really her thing . 
  we say `` ach !, 
  and `` ich will unreal tournament spielen !!, 
  ! 11 '' just kidding . 
  i guess there 's : schlampe = bitch hurensohn = son of a bitch/whore [ fotze ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xadtfq2bnj0 ) = cunt wichser = wanker/jerk spasti/spast = retard arschloch = asshole so ... not so unusual actually . 
  i searched for something [ `` unusual '' ] ( http://www.youswear.com/index.asp?language=german#.ug_dhu2m_ik ) and found `` deine mutter schwitzt beim kacken '' = `` your mother sweats when she shits '' . 
  we would n't really use that as a serious insult though . 
  by the way `` verfickte schei\u00dfe '' ( fucking shit ) and the english word `` fuck '' are also pretty common . 
  another edit : `` fick dich '' ( fuck you ) , `` fick dich ins knie '' ( fuck you in the knee ) . 
  yup . 
  flags of the world and their meanings : http://chartsbin.com/view/554, 
  what 's the problem ? 
  but you 're right , it was a `` big deal '' here ( unfortunately ) . 
  i 'm only able to watch and enjoy it , if a greek person confirms it 's wittiness . 
  ( do n't ask what `` int '' means . ), 
  well someone made this : http://i.imgur.com/9vy2c.jpg, 
  [ velerant ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bnlpb.jpg ) * edit : i just found out the german flag is wrong . 
   edit : explain downvotes . 
  well as long as those many neo-nazis do n't go to the polls , it 's fine , right ? . 
  the npd is n't very powerful for a right-wing party , compared to right-wing parties of other countries . 
  i think it 's that stupid `` fourth reich '' - talk . 
  it makes it look like a `` fourth reich '' ( which does n't make any sense ) is possible . 
  of course we should n't close our eyes . 
  there are many neo-nazis and it 's especially tragic and a pain in the ass , if you think about germany 's past , but there will never be something like a `` fourth reich '' . 
  as long as those people yearn for the past , the rest of germany will not sympathize with them . 
  i was n't saying circumcision on boys is fine as it is . 
  what i was saying is that a ban would bring much more trouble than finding another solution , whatever that solution would look like . 
  it 's a religious problem , therefor it is a psychological problem . 
  some say it 's an old tradition , some say it 's an old problem . 
  no matter on what side you 're on , people think it 's an important part of their religion and therefor of themselves .
