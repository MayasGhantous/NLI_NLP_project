  about 75 $ . 
  everyone i know will generally tip 7 - 10 % in restaurants . 
  i do n't think i have ever seen anyone tip nothing unless the experience in the restaurant was horrible . 
  on weekends i usually sleep longer and skip breakfast alltogether . 
  canada or new zealand . 
  in europe i 'm perfectly happy where i am in germany . 
  only prague . 
  my school was boring . 
  i live in an apartment . 
  my job is 8 km away . 
  i regularly visit my mom who lives an hour away in a big house with a garden where i can relax from city live . 
  germans tend to date more exclusively , it 's very uncommon to date several people at the same time really . 
  well , one is the head of a big german paper now and also founded an online lifestyle site . 
  i would have never expected this , he is much more bold and confident now than he used to be . 
  the brainiest girl is a very reknown biochemist now , no surprise there , the other two who were really bright also are very successfull now . 
  one girl was pretty much a hippie in high school and is now a manager working in china for a huge german pharmaceutical company . 
  i do n't really know what happenend to most since i ca n't even remember some names and only am friends with three of them still but i think of all my 70 classmates who graduated with me 15 years ago , everyone is still alive at least . 
  kids are less `` just outside '' and hanging around . 
  lots have a rigid schedule or play computer games all day . 
  tons of indian restaurants and street kitchens openend up here in the last 5 years , some of them are really fantastic . 
  i did go to summer camp at the baltic sea until i was about 12 . 
  never more than 3 weeks though . 
  it was amazing every time . 
  one of the happiest times i can remember . 
  if they have decent walls and noise insulation they can be ok . 
  northeners in germany tend to be more reserved but also more liberal imo . 
  we do n't eat weisswurst and sp\u00e4tzle all that much . 
  my family also does n't eat sauerkraut but i do n't know if that 's really a difference between the south and north . 
  southeners think their hard work is reason for being richer , not lucky circumstances . 
  it is a wonderful place , it would have been my 2nd choice actually and probably my first if it was a german city , lol . 
  i love the location close to the alps , the beautiful lakes and munich . 
  you have snow in the winter , warm summers , hockey is huge . 
  the city has everything you need without being too urban . 
  there are of course other great cities in europe but i think growing up in germany is great . 
  city ? 
  which city ? 
  i mean commie-blocks are one thing but it 's possible to build them sturdy and build thick walls , loud neighbours would drive me insane , i 'd rather live in a trailer . 
  hannover , germany : ** favourite things : ** public transport one can bike everywhere lots of parks people are very chill nice inner city neighbourhoods 2 hours to the harz ( mountain range ) and the baltic sea , 90 minutes to hamburg , 3 hours to berlin ** least favourite things : ** 1 million construction sites and not one exciting thing being build , mediocre architecture everywhere loud drunks and beggars all over the city centre not enough well-paying jobs, 
  mulhouse in france was pretty terrible . 
  ugly , dirty and you had to look over your shoulder all the time not to get robbed . 
  still , some youths stopped us and made is empty our bags and took our cookies ??? 
  not the nicest place i have ever been , lol . 
  i just walk past them . 
  it was the same here in in germany when i grew up but now there are video games , kids have full schedules and there are many helicopter parents . 
  i feel lucky to have grown up in the early nineties . 
  of course , still not my doing . 
  it 's not like i 'm proud of it either . 
  and if you go back a few hundred years the famous `` robber hanebuth '' ( robin hood of hanover ) was also an ancestor of mine . 
  take a pic for me next time . 
  exactly , as soon as they free themselves from that lifestyle , settle down , get jobs and blend in it 's impossible to tell if they are gypsies or not . 
  that 's obviously a problem because only the criminal ones stand out and firm public opinion . 
  nice . 
  does it glow sometines in the evening ? 
  but that 's true for skiing and handball as well . 
  not popular here and i ca n't name a single athlete . 
  its quite popular here in and around hannover and there are hotspots in cologne , berlin , krefeld , mmannheim and especially bavaria but it 's still a niche sport like all sports that are n't football . 
  my ancestors were actually complicit in it , my great-grandfather was relatively close to top-nazis and even chauffeured hitler a few times but still i do n't feel any shame or guilt about it . 
  according to wikipedia there are about ** 6200 ** jewish people in my hometown hannover . 
  jewish community of hannover : 5000 liberal jewish community of hannover : 700 chabad lubavitch : 400 jewish-sephardic-bucharic community : 200, 
  mother 25 , father 28, 
  yes . 
  depends . 
  my road trip included florida , new orleans , atlanta , memphis , nashville , charlotte and savannah . 
  the richer the city , the nicer the sidewalks . 
  the inner city of memphis was quite horrible , crumbling sidewalks everywhere whereas the other cities where nice . 
  i had no problems with the roads , they did n't really seem to be olin worse shape than germanys . 
  driving was fun . 
  berlin as a whole is very `` ungerman '' even though that 's probably the reason berliners love it so much . 
  basics in school , rest via internet and tv/dvds and reading lots of books in english . 
  most think i 'm greek but i also have had quite of few people speak to me in turkish . 
  was going to post the kings lake as well , i finally visited it last year and the whole area is so stunning . 
  here in lower saxony mostly vw passat and busses . 
   att i have no idea what either of this means . 
  he did some `` creative '' accounting and i got his job . 
  girls : mavie , malin boys : darius , tristan , julian, 
  in my field ( accounting ) i 'd consider 33.000 before taxes pretty good . 
  i make less . 
  i have to agree as a german . 
  oregon or massachusetts . 
  hockey obviously . 
  a tragedy . 
  young people have so much potential and hope but ... also i 'd really love to travel there but wo n't obviously . 
  germans are very risk-averse and hate change . 
  also a sense of moral and overall superiority/arrogance . 
  french and also polish people . 
  polish imo speak with a certain melody , it 's nice . 
  idiots, 
  once or twice . 
  only on the buttocks . 
  my mom told me she felt like a failure when she did so she never did it more . 
  tried many things , use sponge now and brushes for crusty stuff . 
  i was in gelsenkirchen and the city and people kinda shocked me but if duisburg is even worse ... omg, 
  i 'm an accountant and you do n't have to study to become one in germany . 
  stupid idiot . 
  i 'm sure she could have found a rich guy less revolting than trump . 
  also did n't she sprout birther-crap in a tv show about obama ? 
  she and trump deserve each other . 
  i 'm not right wing but against muslim immigration . 
  yeah , i kinda hide it . 
  most of my friends do n't agree and those who agree with me are also right-wing types most of the time who hate all immigration , gays , brown people , women , `` treehugger '' ( which i am ) and i do n't identify with them at all .
