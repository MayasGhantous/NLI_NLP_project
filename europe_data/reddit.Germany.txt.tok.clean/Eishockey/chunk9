  i want colder winters so that lakes freeze over for two months straight and people can play hockey outside . 
  right now we can do this in the north of germany only every few years for a week or so . 
  snow and heat i do n't like that much so that can stay as it is . 
  i 'm also ok with the amount of rain and sunny days we have . 
  most people do n't habe long enough commutes so they do n't care what much . 
  so now you want to help make other ( brown ) people victims of war ? 
  i used to be a member of a shootingclub here in germany . 
  it was fun for a month or two then i lost interest . 
  been to austria , denmark , turkey , czech rep , netherlands , belgium , italy , spain . 
  portugal , switzerland , poland and france . 
  portugal was my favourite so far . 
  turkey 's nature and istanbul were magnificent as well . 
  mostly suburbia even though most big cities have rich areas as well but here around hannover big money lives in big houses in villages surrounding the city . 
  i had the opposite experience in austria but then again my comparison are german waiters . 
  yes , but the more complex the issue they more you have to pay yourself . 
  i heard split is totally overrun by tourists each summer , does it really get no recognition ? 
  probably vw polo . 
  could have been my cousin . 
  he married a hijab-wearing turkish-german woman . 
  he converted to islam though , she would not have married him otherwise . 
  i hate snow but i always run outside just when it starts to snow and and take pictures before it starts to melt and turns into a grey mess . 
  nothing photographs better . 
  it 's nice . 
  i 've been in passau this august and took a pic from the same bridge i guess . 
  this is a pic of the village in the north of hannover i grew up in . 
  it enbodies the things i love about it , the quiet , so much green and beautiful half-timbered houses . 
  [ green village ] ( https://imageshack.com/a/img921/3108/egw8bd.jpg ) picture of hannover i took when our big lake in the city center was frozen solid . 
  i 'm not sure how often this will happen anymore because of global warming . 
  i love ice-skating and hockey so these days when it was cold enough that the lake froze were my favourite . 
  [ hannover in winter ] ( https://imageshack.com/a/img921/7933/qynemr.jpg ), 
  boars and game are hunted quite a bit in the village i grew up in . 
  but it 's not necessarily depression . 
  i had depression and i 'm not depressed right now , still i hate how my life turned out and how few relationships and experiences i have . 
  pills wont cure that . 
  you ca n't really start over once you 've hit a certain age . 
  most are nice and interesting . 
  the chinese never mingle and keep to themselves though . 
  switzerland and it 's not even close . 
  there are so few blacks here that that issue never really came up . 
  does n't mean we do n't see race . 
  other than that if you 're mixed and successfully you 're considered german , if you 're a criminal you 're a dirty foreigner . 
  yeah i 've always thought that this wad the better of the german anthems, 
  i ca n't really say since we do n't speak about it . 
  no one i know is religious , i suppose quite a few have faith though so they are not really atheists , right . 
  12,53 , $ , i mostly usr my debit card . 
  i 'm only against late abortions that have nothing to do with the health of child of mother . 
  i think any terrorist attack would make a win more realistic since people vote radical parties out of fear and hate . 
  i have one and everyone i know has one as well . 
  i use it quite often for cooking and baking . 
  i hate cabbage but i love kohlrouladen , anybody with me ? 
  can i come too ? 
  i had a terrible week so i 'm going to eat something unhealthy , something for the soul . 
  probably some sort of casserole with chicken , cream , potatoes , metaxa , champignons and cheese . 
  i watched a video of a trial in rural kentucky where the judge mentioned `` we are not perfect but we still have the best judical system in the world '' . 
  nobody even asked about it , he just felt like mentioning it while sentencing a young mentally retarded young girl to life in prison without parole . 
  crazy . 
  no other citizens in the world do this . 
  flow, 
  i had anti-american views but i was never far left . 
  he 'll appease the religious far and alt-right in the us but that wo n't affect us . 
  protecting eastern europe will be big thing . 
  and the environment loses big time . 
  usa have not been `` the leader of the free world '' for a long time . 
  this is bad for everyone , us is too influential for this to not suck fir europe as well . 
  the generation of my grandparents still spoke low german but everyone else was only talking dialect-free german . 
  i have 30 days plus national holidays . 
  no , i 've heard of debbie boone ... 
  i live in a larger city ( half a million ) and i have three grocery stores in a 100 m radius . 
  public transport is amazing , i never have to walk more than 5 minutes to either get a bus or tram . 
  for short distances , i always use my bike , it 's faster , healthier and more practical than public transport or a car here in the city . 
  i use a delivery service for beverages , it 's pretty cheap . 
  if i really need a car , i use [ green wheels ] ( https://www.greenwheels.com/de/ ) . 
  that said , everyone i now that lives in the suburbs drives a car . 
  some parents or kids try to make trick or treating happen but its not really taking off since only about 5 % of houses give out any sweets on halloween . 
  we have fasching to dress up and st. martins day to go from door to door to collect sweets , it 's not like kids miss this . 
  here around hannover kids go from door to door asking for treats singing an old german song `` matten matten m\u00e4ren '' . 
  it 's dying out though like all old traditions . 
  10 years ago almost all kids took part , nowadays maybe 20 % . 
  20 % go around during halloween even though a lot of older people refuse to give our sweets during halloween .

  yeah , my [ preferred milk ] ( http://www.nierada-marketing.de/wp-content/uploads/hemme-milch-milchbeutel.jpg ) also comes in that type of bag . 
  people want to carry juices around often ? 
  it 's accepted but still considered shady and everyone knows that even in the big brothels there 's a lot of human traffiking . 
  spa culture is pretty , big here and in most sauna areas you have to be naked . 
  i think it 's benficial to see many different naked bodies , especially when you 're young . 
  i realized pretty early that way that most people have very imperfect bodies , strech marks , saggy skin and boobs etc. 
  i think it helps to get comfortable with one 's own imperfections . 
  sensible requests really . 
  swimming lessons are mandatory in elementary school but since a lot of public pools are closing because of money problems , not every school has the opportunity . 
  also many muslim girls are held back by their parents . 
  ewww ... 
  i dunno , both my friends that spent a year in the us had horrible stories to tell and both went to suburban schools . 
  for the older generation it 's certainly bread , potatoes , cold cuts , rolls , tomatoes , lots of meat and fatty sauce . 
  the younger generation eats more diverse stuff imo . 
  every one i know loves m\u00fcsli , currys , d\u00f6ner . 
  i am . 
  i love my country even though sometimes i am sad about things my country and my countrymen do . 
  it 's not easy loving germany , i 'm obsessed about our history but in a way that makes me love germany even more , it 's a kind of tender affection coupled with heartache . 
  my patrotism also includes things like making sure nobody ever forgets about things like babi yar , people need to never forget , that does n't mean i feel guilty about it in any way but it needs to be part of every german imo .
