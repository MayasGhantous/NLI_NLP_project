those are super expensive . 
  horseshit , they cost nothing . 
  you have to buy 2 beer and one chicken coupons per head , that 's it and the chicken coupon can be used as beer/food coupon.you do n't pay any extra fee . 
  on the evenings you have to pay 5 $ per person , but these 5 $ can be used as a coupon as well . 
  source : i have 2 tables in hacker on the second tuesday since 2010 . 
  just 131,7 billion as of 2011 , but who 's counting ... 
  for years everyone is crying for germany to act more actively and put our financial and economic power into action , and now that we do , it 's suddenly selfish and reckless . 
  just ignore that germany is pumping billions of $ into southern europe . 
  ignore that it 's that money that keeps italy , greece or spain alive . 
  she was busy pumping money into greece , spain and italy and so the shit does not hit the fan . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15748696 ) , it started as early as 2010 , maybe even earlier but i 'm too lazy to go further . 
  because they are fake , like the shit sold at the vietnamese markets in your country ... 
  funnily enough munich as the most successful city is traditionally left . 
  it 's a tiny little island of logic in a sea of stupidity . 
   now a problem with hybrid ( partially electric ) cars is that you 're driving around the weight of two motors , both of them small and weak , two tanks . 
  you call 245bhp weak ? 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_der_konzentrationslager_des_deutschen_reichs except for buchenwald , dachau and emsland almost all of them were closed before 1935 . 
  fyi , there were only two kz in germany , dachau and buchenwald ( three if you cound emsland as kz ) . 
  the rest were outside , mainly in poland . 
  the only times i pay cash is in bars , when i go out , in the bakery or if i want to get rid of change . 
  everything else i pay with my cards . 
  the lowest amount i every paid with my debit card was one cheese burger at burger king for 99cent . 
  i remember because the cashier was suprised it worked haha . 
  believe it or not , but construction is dominated by legal polish , romanian and bulgarian construction workers and they are very protective about their jobs . 
  some time ago a couple of polish workers beat the shit out of illegal albanians looking for work in munich . 
  the polish were legally working and even go on night watch to protect equipment . 
  also the legal workers are cheap as fuck anyway and since the authorities have zero tolerance regarding black labour a lot of companies do n't risk it anymore , just to safe a couple of euros . 
  the risk of getting caught is very high at the moment . 
  farm work is really the only thing that might be an option , but even there are a shitload of legal workers from eastern europe . 
  i know the company . 
  i know their cars . 
  i drove by them every day for 4 years . 
  majority of them are on temporary plates , which means they are not registered and paid yet . 
  i bet they went to a dealship , overdrew their credit cards and brought them back after the party . 
  plate is from a sports car rental company . 
  so unless the gypsie owns that rental company it 's not his . 
  and the ferrari is also with temporary plates . 
  have you never seen the show `` ice road truckers '' ? 
  it 's a gold and diamond mining city . 
  truck loads of money, 
  sending someone to get the `` siemens lufthaken '' ( siemens air hooks ) , `` getriebesand '' ( transmission/gear sand ) , `` frequenzwasser '' ( frequency water ) , the key for the `` verf\u00fcgungsraum '' ( verf\u00fcgungsraum = staging area . 
  raum can mean room or area , depending on context ) or in the army send him to the `` kartendruckraum , the room with kdr above it . 
  there is some old guy in there , he might be slightly mad if you barge in , but he 's just a reserve officer and is not important . '', 
  ( kdr is the acronym for commander , cdr , but `` kartendruckraum '' means map printing room ) . 
  i had to do my sergeants training course back than . 
  we were ordered that every soldier had to carry an additional 3l of water for field exercises . 
  although i drank more than 4l a day i barely had to pee because it was so hot . 
  i sweat like a horse , but my uniform was n't damp , not even the slightest . 
   a crime is allowed to detain oh nonononononononononono , be very careful . 
  you 're allowed to use force to keep someone from escaping until police or any law enforcement arrives . 
  ** detaining ** is something completely different and requires an order of a judge or state attorney . 
  not even the police is allowed to detain you . 
  they can arrest you or ** temporarily ** detain you for your own safety , ** big ** legal difference . 
  festhalten is not detain . 
  you can get into big trouble if you say you detained someone based on jedermann . 
  just because they clock more hours , does n't mean they actually do something in those hours . 
  those working hours simply mean that someone clocked in and stayed for a period of time . 
  this is no indication whether they are productive or if they are on a constant smoke break . 
  also do n't forget the amount of automization we have and they have . 
  our average worker might clock less hours , but a skilled worker can monitor 2 or 3 machines simultanouesly , thus he is a shitload more efficient in less time . 
  if you 'd look a the time vs. output numbers , you 'd see the massive difference . 
  funny , last time i checked , the bodyguards of putin , special police forces and some leading politicians use bmw 7-series or mercedes benz armored cars . 
  also every 3rd bmw suv is exported to russia . 
  a lot of rich and powerful would be very upset , i guess . 
  obama flew to munich with air force one , switched to marine one and flew in a formation of 3 helicopters to elmau , about 100km/60miles . 
  of course the had to walk , his carbon footprint is off the charts . 
  they can afford it , since tickets are overbooked 7 to 16 times . 
  so if you apply for a season ticket for next year , there would be at least 7 people before you . 
  that 's obsolete actually , duden styleguide introduced hyphenation for long words ages ago . 
  if a word consists of more than 3 different compounds you 're supposed to add a hyphen between every compound after the second , too ease reading . 
  i personally would even go so far and do n't connect and say `` dunstabzugshauben-befestigungsmaterial qualit\u00e4tssicherungs-beauftragter . '', 
  but then again , styleguides are n't binding so you can actually do whatever the fuck you like . 
  yeah , currywurst is n't very popular outside of the pott or berlin . 
  d\u00f6ner is popular everywhere . 
  it 's out of context . 
  you need all of it . 
  first he makes fun of erdogan being butthurt about a very harmless song from another comedy show and that erdogan wanted to prosecute the other show first . 
  `` but they did n't say anything offensive . 
  offensive would be * insert goat fucker poem * '' . 
  quite interesting that a `` busy '' and `` important '' head of state still has time to deal with some comedian from a foreign country . 
  clearly shows where exactly his priorities are . 
  ever thought about that they might hate the us as well ? 
  a lot of cubans blame the us for the situation in cuba . 
  so why would they go to the us if they hate it ? 
  it 's cheaper and your chances of being accepted are much higher . 
  or they hate america , which might me the case here . 
  sarkasmusdetektormonopol is the word you 're looking for . 
  na , it 's missing the cellar bit . 
  or the repeatedly failed ban of the npd ( neo-nazi party ) , rocker clubs or hooligan fan clubs . 
  while they might violate one fundamental right , they are protected by another . 
  so they go after individuals , rather then the whole organizations . 
  problem is that religious freedom ( article 4 ) is on-par with social equality ( article 3 ) . 
  so while the burga is discriminating women , a ban would seriously discriminate religious freedom . 
  if we start to value one higher than the other , shit will really hit the fan . 
  because you can not take these with you on a crowded bus or train . 
  also some people use lte usb sticks to watch netflix on their laptops . 
  i 'd too if i had real , unlimited data , but my 4 gigs are barely enough for spotify every day to work . 
  some people watch netflix on their phones . 
  1h of hd video can easily be 500mb or more . 
  watch a season of any series and you 're way over 5gigs .
