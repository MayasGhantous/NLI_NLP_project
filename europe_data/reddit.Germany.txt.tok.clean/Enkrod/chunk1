well they ** are ** beneath us ... 
  wow ... camden & inner city of london as well as westminster are unreal ... no wonder everyone wants a piece of that cake ... 
  so it 's confirmed , you do ** not ** want more people . 
  i 'm fairly certain the nato will agree to no such talks until both * ukraine accepts the annexation of the krim by russia , * the donbas is widely at peace . 
  ukraine has played it 's cards poorly in the past . 
  they did not have the nato backing them and still offended russia . 
  the only way out of their misery would be to join the nato , but the nato will not be dragged into a conflict with russia for a not-yet-member . 
  ofcourse this means that ruassia will make sure there is no peace on ukranian soil , so the nato wo n't let it join ... at least not without major concessions to putins russia . 
  it 's a damned if you do , damned if you do n't situation and i 'm ** very ** curious to how this plays out . 
  my bet is the best way to go would just be to hurry ukraine into nato and send nato troops immediately to the donbas and secure every scrap of border they can find . 
  this ofcourse may lead into a new cold war with russia and russian-powered insurgency in the donbas-region but i believe calling putins bluff would be in the power of nato . 
  i expect none of this to happen though , not with trump in the white house , not with european politics what they are , not with german pacifism and not with the very defensive leadership of nato not caring about ukranian stability . 
  [ london ] ( https://stats.linx.net/cgi-pub/exchange?log=combined.bits ) has big fibreoptic cables connecting it to the internet backbone !, 
  whatever will [ frankfurt ] ( https://www.de-cix.net/en/locations/germany/frankfurt/statistics ) do ? 
  it 's only the largest internet exchange point worldwide !, 
  how can it compete ? 
  if you would allow me to make the case for [ ** positivist atheism ** ] ( http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=strong_atheism ) : if i say `` i know there is no god . '', 
  i do n't mean `` i have absolute knowledge and therefore can not be wrong . '', 
  what i mean is : `` in the same sense , that i know there is no toothfairy and no santa , insofar as i can have knowledge in the first place , i know there is no god . '', 
  i 'm an atheist in the same sense that i 'm an afairyist and an asantaist . 
  i know they do n't exist , because nothing in my internal model of reality requires their existence or even allowes their existence . 
  this however does not mean that i can not be convinced . 
  all i 'm saying is that it would be as reality-shattering for me as finding out there is a little man in my brain , pulling levers to make me move . 
  by the way : my position is shared by a relatively small contigent of atheists . 
  your definition of `` do n't know there is a god '' , that you attribute to agnosticism is what most [ explicit atheists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negative_and_positive_atheism ) would describe themselves as . 
  `` you nearly ca n't smell the piss from up here . '', 
  oh so people old enough to not be able to bear children should never marry ? 
  and what about people who are infertile ? 
  are they allowed to `` marry '' ? 
  because they can never be mothers ... so they should only be `` unions '' , yes ? 
  and people not wanting children ofcourse , ca n't have them marry , they do n't even want to bring new life . 
  oh spd and opposition were n't too weak . 
  red red green had enough power to pass this all the time . 
  the spd did not want to break the coalition contract though and while i did n't like it , i fully understand that they would not abandon a contract they made . 
  with merkels commentary now though ... she is the one opening that door but only wanted to talk about it after the election . 
  and schulz had the brains to immediatly call out the cdu and demand they stand by her words , election or not . 
  i know this is racist , but for a second i wondered if the rocket would wobble its head ... this dialect just makes me smile and think of nice brown people talking funnily and wiggeling their heads ... 
  i 'm so sorry ... 
  congratulation , you entertained an easily entertainable german , have an upvote . 
  makes no sense , should be an umbrella against hard impacting . 
  * triggered * ;p, 
  woah ... this is actually hard thinking in an engaging discussion , i like it . 
  first of all , i totally and whole heartedly disagree with this :  non-muslims who take part in this project , on the other had , are necessarily dishonest in some sense ( if you really believe god said/commaded p , q , r why do n't you f-ing convert ? ) . 
  i do n't have to believe some god wants p , q or r to ** honestly ** believe that it would be better if people believed their god wants p , q and r. ofcourse it would be better if they abandoned religion at all , but - just as an example - people believing the flying spaghetti monster wants them to eat pasta is better than them believing the fsm wants them to eat babies . 
  in the same sense , what would be wrong with me ( an atheist ) supporting peaceful , laizist currents of islam over salafism and wahabism ? 
  i will however concede , that supporting specifig groups ( like gulen ) instead of currents and supporting them not to create a more peaceful coexistance of mankind but to further ones own goals and to accumulate influence is not only precarious but right out dangerous . 
  your argument , taken as a whole , would stop me from making any change in the thoughtscape of other people and thus from producing change in the world in my favor . 
  and i think it is very much my right and in part even my obligation to change the world towards what i think is a better world . 
  that 's neither corruptive nor concealed illegitimate authority . 
  since i consider myself part of a european liberal intelligensia i sadly know full well what you mean . 
  i actually [ wrote a comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/6gwdaz/why_dont_people_understand_the_difference_between/diu7nkp/ ) some time ago in another sub , about how it is that some liberals tend to shun every criticism of islam as racism . 
  the mechanisms i hypothesize there can easily explain why some liberals shun everything they percieve as intolerant . 
  even if it is tolerance towards bullshit . 
  some going even so far as to right out tell people to be more tolerant of intolerance . 
  you can see by the colors , they are already wearing each others clothes . 
  yeah ... ** no **, 
  alright , this seems like the right way to go . 
  sorry for my misjudgement , i get triggered easily since a turkish classmate held a presentation in an advanced biology course about how the eye never could have evolved after we spend two weeks learning about how the eye evolved multiple times ... 
  the difference here is : evolution is a scientific theory . 
  to be a theory in the first place , you have to be pretty well established . 
  creationism is n't even science . 
  and because of this , creationism has no grounds to be taught in a science class , except as a : `` this is proven to be bullshit '' - sense . 
  well it 's burocracy we 're talking about here . 
   was born in 2001 wait , and you ... oh shit ... 
  i am so oooooooooooooooooooooooooold, 
  superior ** european ** humanist ethics . 
  that 's because we love to eat all your pork !, 
  i get the feeling you have not really read what i took some hours to write . 
   not racist , no . 
  and i wonder what kind of strawman that is you are pushing over ... not even the most leftist islamophile would make the case that it 's racist if society demands something from the individual . 
  some people made stupid demands though , do you really think those foreigners would turn into lederhosen-wearing , wei\u00dfbeer-drinking exemplar germans ? 
   all in all this is just another strawman he is building . 
  noone in his right mind thinks that is racist . 
  i 've even explicitly written that i do not think his arguments are racist . 
  my main argument is that he is misrepresenting the arguments of the people he criticizes . 
  mostly by building strawmen-arguments of things none of them would say and then pushing those over . 
  so thank you for another great example of misrepresentation and trying to undermine an argument by just playing the `` so you think it 's racist !, 
  '' - card . 
  part2 because too long :  there is also , for europe , the sense of what i call tiredness -- the feeling that the story might have run out : that we have tried religion , all imaginable forms of politics , and that each has , one after another , led us to disaster . 
  when we taint every idea we touch , perhaps a change is as good as a rest . 
  you seem to be lacking in imagination my good sir . 
  and boy is this bullshitbingo again ... just , read it again ... do you feel the dry , grey tiredness he wants you to feel ? 
  do you actually feel it ? 
  now tell me ... how is this not a strawman again ? 
   it is often argued that our societies are old , with a graying population , and so we need immigrants . 
  when these theories are challenged -- by asking , for instance , why the next generation of germany 's workforce might not come from unemployed greece rather than eritrea -- again with the theme of old , grey and dusty . 
   we are told that we need low-skilled workers who do not speak our languages because it makes europe more culturally interesting . 
  source please . 
  and i do n't mean some fringe crackpot , i mean how does this represent what ... let 's say our governments tell us ? 
  because mine is not . 
  hell my christian conservative government would prefer greek workers over eritreans a thousand times . 
  and this is how i know what you say is bullshit and that you know it is bullshit and and how i know that you do n't want to address the real reason why a cdu-led government tells refugees they are welcome . 
  ( hint : that they are conservative christians does not mean they are monsters )  it is as though some great hole lies at the heart of the culture of dante , bach and wren . 
  again with the strawmen ... well guys , i 'll have to stop this here and continue at a later point in time , because i need to be grocery shopping right now . 
  look for part 3 in about 2-3 hours ( took me long enough to write this part ) if i do n't loose focus and end up cooking a big dinner after shopping . 
  alright ... let 's take it apart then ...  europe in 2017 is racked with uncertainty -- the eurozone crises , the endless challenges of the european union , national elections that resemble endless rounds of bullet-dodging . 
  a bleak present and by extension a darker future , everything is endless , he 's starting to build his picture . 
  let 's keep an eye on that . 
  yes , the challenges of the european union are endless ... because time does not stop . 
  reality moves on , there will always be change and the union will always have to react to it .
