  also the union itself is far from perfect and yes , it has to change to fix it 's many flaws . 
  it may move sluggish and sometimes even in the wrong direction , but right now it feels to me that we have the chance to turn those false steps around and move in the right direction . 
  sure it 'll be two steps forward and one back ... but i believe it 's taking us forward . 
   yet even these events are insignificant compared with the deep tectonic shifts beneath the continent 's politics uhhhhhh , ** deep tectonic shifts beneath the surface ** ... omnious ... 
  i read this in a christopher lee voice . 
  this is rather well done , making the reader feel like there are things moving he can not see , omnious powers beneath the surface . 
  this always works well with `` the elites '' when you want people to feel they are not represented . 
   shifts that europeans -- and their allies -- ignore at our peril . 
  so you are neither european nor an ally and you want your readers to feel the same ( note the use of `` our '' ) ? 
  ok , got it . 
  and ** ignore ?!, 
  ignore ?!, 
  ** have you had a look at the news lately ? 
  hell your own article is proof that it is not ignored !, 
  most people are just ok with moving in a direction you do n't approve of . 
  this means ** they ignore you ** , not the peril you want to make them feel they are in . 
  we made it through the first paragraph and every fuckin ' sentence was a joke . 
  let 's go deeper into the rabbit hole alice . 
   throughout the migration crisis of recent years let me stop you right there hoss , are you talking about migrants or refugees ? 
  because like most people you seem to conflate the two . 
   i traveled across the continent , from the reception islands into which migrants arrive to the suburbs in which they end up and the chancelleries which encouraged them to come . 
  yes , the chancellor encouraged them to come . 
  merkel said germany would except ** refugees ** ( not migrants , not guestworkers mind you ) and just like that , a war in syria started , so they would have an excuse to migrate to europe . 
  or ... maybe there were actual people , families , fleeing a war torn country were there was nothing but starvation , religious persecution and forced conscription for them . 
  a war that can trace it 's roots directly back to the instability and turmoil caused by the illegal invasion of iraq . 
  an invasion btw . 
  germany warned against and did not participate in . 
  and we are the ones getting flak for picking up the tab ? 
   for decades europe had encouraged guest workers , and then their families , to come . 
  as germany 's chancellor angela merkel once admitted , nobody expected them to stay . 
  ohhhh !, 
  so you are conflating migrants , guestworkers and refugees . 
  ok , got it . 
   yet stay they did and yes , i full well expect most of the refugees and the migrants to stay . 
  and if they want to , i will want them to change certain things . 
  i want them to adopt a more secular viewpoint on politics , to integrate well without completely assimilating . 
  i want them to learn our languages , to work and their children to damn well pay my pension when the time comes . 
   with their numbers swelling even when there were no jobs . 
  waking up to the results of their policy , european societies rebranded themselves `` multicultural '' societies , only to begin wondering what that meant . 
  could a multicultural society make any demands of its newcomers ? 
  or would that be `` racist '' ? 
  not racist , no . 
  and i wonder what kind of strawman that is you are pushing over ... not even the most leftist islamophile would make the case that it 's racist if society demands something from the individual . 
  some people made stupid demands though , do you really think those foreigners would turn into lederhosen-wearing , wei\u00dfbeer-drinking exemplar germans ? 
  all in all this is just another strawman he is building . 
  noone in his right mind thinks that is racist . 
   from the 2000s legal and illegal immigration picked up . 
  boats regularly set out from turkey and north africa to enter europe illegally . 
  syrians fleeing civil war pushed into the continent illegal immigration is illegal ... wow , that 's deep mate . 
  syrian refugees are '' ** pushing into ** the continent '' ... or maybe they were ** driven from ** their homes , many of them lost friends and family members to a damn proxy war that destabilized syria enough for the one of the most horrendous and despised organizations to gain a foothold . 
   today the great migration is off the front pages . 
  mostly because it is not that great anymore . 
   yet it goes on . 
  on an average weekend nearly 10,000 people arrive on italian reception islands alone . 
  where do they go ? 
  what do they expect ? 
  and what do we expect of them ? 
  maoam !, 
  ( sorry , stupid german 30something humor ) you are raising a lot of good questions there . 
  it 's a pity you dont answer them . 
  like ... ** at all ** , sure your next sentence :  to find the answer to these and other questions it is necessary to ask deeper questions . 
  makes it seem like you want to address them , but further reading confirms my suspicion ... you do n't . 
  all you need them for is to have hard , unanswered questions hanging threateningly in the air . 
  the tone of incoming peril and dark forces conspiring to bring down our way of life does pervade throughout the article . 
  everything he can present in a bad light , he will , everything that poses a threat to his narrative , he will conflate with more convenient stuff . 
   why did europe decide it could take in the poor and dispossessed of the world ? 
  it did not ? 
   why did we decide that anybody in the world fleeing war , or just seeking a better life , could come to europe and call it home ? 
  ** wow this , this one sentence is really well crafted bullshit and compiles all of the above into one concentrated stinking pile . 
  your narrative does not hold up to europeans helping actual refugees , so you ** have to ** conflate refugees with people `` just seeking a better life '' . 
  the reason we allow refugees in is because we are not monsters . 
  because most europeans will willingly help someone in need because they are good people . 
  we do n't give a shit about what or who they are . 
  if they are dying , starving , fleeing religious persecution we are not only compelled by european and international law but our superior humanist ethics to help them . 
  the european countries , the people and the union , have given themselves laws that were hatched in the fires of endless religious wars on the continent , raised by the age of enlightenment and forged in the fire of two worldwars . 
  they might not be perfect , but over all they are good and righteous and we stand by them , even if they compell us to do things we might not profit from . 
   the reasons lie partly in our history , not least in the overwhelming german guilt , which has spread across the continent and affected even our cultural cousins in america and australia . 
  yeah , they better feel guilty for the evil regime they brought down ... / s wow ... americans and australians feeling german guilt ... just ... wow ... did it ever cross your mind that people are able to do the right thing , to be altruistic even without feeling guilty ? 
  or are you too religious for that ? 
   egged on by those who wish us ill , we have fallen for the idea that we are uniquely guilty , uniquely to be punished , and uniquely in need of having our societies changed as a result . 
  ** who even feels that way ?!, 
  ** does anyone here , know anyone in their right mind , who says that ? 
  is that really a mainstream feeling ? 
  do `` we '' feel that way ? 
  i certainly do n't !, 
  my european ** culture ** rose from the ashes of religion . 
  from a time when people started questioning christian dogma and drag religion kicking and screaming into the age of the enlightenment . 
  from the taming of religious fervor and the grand humanist ideals , that even the religious can agree on . 
  those are the foundation of europe . 
  my ** european ** culture rose from the ghost of the wars between germany and france . 
  from a hatred so strong , we invented the word `` erbfeindschaft '' for it . 
  a hatred that is nowhere to be seen today . 
  the friendship between francs and germans is stronger than ever and will likely be the grounds on which a tighter collaboration in europe will be build . 
  and even after a beginning brexit , a big part of me beeing a european is me speaking and writing english , a language that is not my own , but that feels like second nature to me , because i do not want to be trapped in the close confines of my country , my continent , my ethnicity or my own culture . 
  ** my ** european culture rose from the ashes of the people my own grandfather wanted to burn in the ovens . 
  and i do n't feel like we need to change or to be punished . 
  yes , my grandfather was a nazi . 
  so what ? 
  what germany has accomplished since the war , what europe has accomplished in theese years of peace is astounding !, 
  never since the invention of nation states has this contintent known a period of peace this long .
