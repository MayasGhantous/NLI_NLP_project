no , we believe drafts lead to colds . 
  fine , then we 'll call it heavy metal instead , ok ? 
  to be killed in their sleep by electric fans ? 
  lol , no it 's not . 
  ragga is stuff like supercat and ini kamoze , which is very different from this . 
  i 'm not sure he is , else he would have posted a vauxhall panda , surely ? 
  that car is pretty much in existence thanks to uk police . 
   best gardens in all of europe , you get the rain advantage though !, 
  you forgot most instances of the phrase ` what 's that converted to euros ? 
  no , that ca n't be right ' uttered by foreign visitors . 
  damn right . 
  my most driven route is usually 4 lanes of pure unlimited goodness , but recently roadworks have limited most of it to a tedious rest of europe like 120kph and in places an ungodly north american like 80kph . 
  when it returns to normal i will even subject myself to listening to swr4s non stop schlager hour while driving down it the first few times , it 'll be like slowly easing myself out of an abusive relationship . 
  you also have created the perfect topping for fries . 
  us , the belgians and english have all tried to copy or imitate with varying amounts of success , none of which come close to the dutch stuff . 
  yeah , i ca n't believe half the answers in here wanting places full of guns and violence like the states and israel , or closed off places like japan and south korea . 
  give me a beach , some cocktails and some reggae music over that stress any day . 
  although seriously now , the answer here should be the seychelles , any nation that co-operates with europe like they do to preserve shipping routes is aok in my book . 
   but honestly i do n't know much about their general attitudes koreans believe electric fans ( ventilatoren ) can kill you and japanese kids ( and often adults ) play a game called ` kancho ' which involves sticking their fingers up each others assholes . 
  still want them in ? 
  probably because it has everything needed to appeal to teenage girls . 
  i reckon a german rapper called cro would be a household name in the us if he sang in english . 
  [ traum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wqmbv2deyq ) and [ einmal um die welt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2pysxcmwpc ) are two of his bigger hits . 
  rockwise the two biggest bands that are almost exclusively german speaking are die toten hosen and die \u00e4rzte . 
  both started out as very typical 80s punk bands , but the former have developed a more stadium rock sound over the years and the latter an indie/electro type sound , although neither take themselves too seriously . 
  [ hier kommt alex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x-yqphitr8 ) and [ bonnie and clyde ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rseotc2cug ) are the most loved toten hosen tracks among the general public but us students may prefer [ zehn kleine j\u00e4germeister ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahsrhdi35te ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujiassaurb0 ) are probably your best bets for \u00c4rzte tracks . 
  after that - fettes brot - german language answer to the beastie boys . 
  hip hop with an electronic influence , my favourite tune is [ f\u00fcr immer immer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bttc1jzam6i ) , which is about doing chicks in different cities . 
  sido - massively popular supposed ` gangsta rapper ' that is also a ` popstars ' judge ( go figure ) . 
  my favourite from him would be [ bilder in kopf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rveijfr7lv4 ) mark forster/eff - a very varied singer that goes from doing romantic poppy balleds to club music that can get quite dubstep/drum n bassy , currently his song ` wir sind gross ' is unavoidable . 
  teamed up with another very popular german musician , house music producer felix jaehn to form eff , check out [ stimme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcsd1o4rdlc ) seed - mostly switch between english and german , they are a reggae/dancehall/hip hop crossover band from berlin . 
  [ waterpumpee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs_xt2ey940 ) is my favourite of theirs , but if you want one with a higher % of german search for aufstehen or dickies b. jan delay - another singer/songwriter producer with a hip hoppy pop reggae vibe , check out [ oh jonny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw7u7ptj-j4 ) sportfreunde stiller - very hard to describe to americans , but they have a very european indie rock sound . 
  i personally find them to be either awful or brilliant on a song by song basis . 
  [ ein kompliment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfd7dc-qhuc ) , [ applause applause ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsfpdln8fyg ) and [ new york , rio , rosenheim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i4psfajnae ) adel tawil - another singer/songwriter/producer , he did the music for the german prison break and a pretty clever song called [ lieder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kimg_jv2gbo ) where he references loads of different artists and their songs . 
  irie revoltes - not quite as well known as the rest in this list , but my favourites . 
  the two singers are brothers with a corsican heritage , so their songs jump between german and french . 
  their music is a crossover between hip hop/ska/reggae and electro . 
  check [ f\u00e4uste hoch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdukvqbdd3q ) , [ explosion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dupozltixe4 ) or [ au soleil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sslhj9gxz4 ) . 
  the point remains . 
  it 's possible that a scouser born and bred can tell jan molby is actually danish , but you 're having a laugh if you think a southerner could . 
  then you do speak the queens . 
  and julio geordio was a character on hary enfield and chums in the late 90s , based on people like the danish football player jan molby , who now is indistinguishable from any other scouser ( [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibsvtr4sibe ) ), 
  i speak better english than my native language , german , as my formative years were spent in the uk . 
  funniest thing was when i was crossing the turkish/bulgarian border at 3am once . 
  border guards bulgarian side spoke no english , which i 'd never seen before , anywhere . 
  spent about 15 minutes trying to communicate with them in very broken turkish before they twigged most of us were actually german , and that all the older guards all spoke great german from the old communist days . 
  except there are those of us that have such good command of the queens you genuinely ca n't tell the difference . 
  have n't you ever heard of julio geordieo ? 
  i ask because unfotunately in these times it 's difficult to know if someone was n't old enough to remember , or has been succesfully brainwashed by the red top media into forgetting brussels did anything other than control the size of bananas . 
  basically , in the late 80s and early 90s the british right were extremely arsey in brussels , they fought tooth and nail against the directives such as the holiday entitlement directive and the working time directive but lost . 
  this was the big starting push for the anti eu movement in britain that we know today . 
  but back then , they were n't hiding behind ` democracy ' and ` sovereignty ' or even immigration , they were quite clear in that they wanted to restrict workers rights , especially in eastern europe , and they certainly did n't want the new rules going into uk law ( britain was using a ` guideline ' before which was very similar to the eu directive , but allowed for less reprisal should a company break the rules ) . 
  the torys managed to put it off until they were voted out and labour voted in , and as such the new rulings were not brought into uk law until 1998 . 
  now , in the past 5 years the british people have essentially given power back to the very people who are fully behind restricting workers rights , and quite happy to admit it , especially pm may . 
  are you old enough to remember the 90s properly ( as in the political situation in europe ) ? 
  the problem is the day more than anything . 
  the city are basically saying ` yeah we know we are fucking you over but it 's cheaper and easier for us ' . the bombs been lying in the open for a few days now , they could have either sorted it out to be done quicker or kept it in whatever state it currently is that allows the residents to have stayed the past few days already . 
  no but we reserve the right to whine about it like it is !, 
  i mean , a year or two ago a motorway that i used almost daily was being repaired and they found a bomb , bastards kept the road shut for two weeks and my commute was lengthened by an hour a day . 
  and these fuckers only have to leave the house for a day ? 
  although to be fair , it 's a bit shitty of them to choose christmas day for the evacuation , not least because theres absolutely fuck all open on xmas day . 
  we got evacuated once when the next door tower block was demolished , they asked the locals which day we preferred and we chose a saturday , most people went out shopping or drinking for 8 hours or whatever they needed . 
  what have officer casualty rates got to do with anything ? 
  that 's only the ones that did actually fight and were n't sat back in a country mansion overseeing ` vital agricultural production ' , which was all too common in ww1 . 
   more focus is put on wwii than wwi in the uk , likely because it was more recent and seemingly more relevant . 
  i disagree with this about relevency , seriousness and respect . 
  i attended comprehensive school in the uk and while ww2 was taught with a history focus , in proper history lessons , ww1 was shifted onto the english literature syllabus to encourage stories of bravery and gallantry among the british working classes . 
  this allowed them to skip all the political and social side , and happily ignore the fact that the upper classes managed to avoid any real involvement in the war whilst the working classes heroicism was essentially forced upon them at gunpoint . 
  still to this day everything i see coming out of britain - with the clear exception of blackadder goes forth - is along these lines , with a focus on the working class soldier rather than any other aspect of the conflict . 
  well luxembourg is part of the problem , we have huge numbers of luxembourg plated vehicles on our roads simply because it 's so cheap and easy for companies to use leased vehicles from luxembourg . 
  these measures will , i assume , go someway to curtailing that - i believe there was a bit of an uproar a year or two back about one of the big long distance bus operators switching to mostly l plated vehicles . 
  well here gardens are a rarity in the cities , although a communal apartment garden is pretty normal , usually with a few washing lines and a table , occasionally a couple of pieces of permanent play equipment for kids . 
  in the villages and small town suburbs , front gardens are usually very small and full of flowers or bushes , not much lawn at all if any , patioed front gardens are very popular . 
  back gardens usually have either a barbecue or a permanent brick/stone built grill , a table and chairs or bench for eating on in the summer , and something which we call a markise - the english translation seems to be awning but that for me is n't specific enough , it looks like [ this ] ( https://img2.jalousiescout.de/landingpages/markisen/lp161/markisen_i2.jpg ) . 
  i 'm in a very small group of people - a poor city dweller with a back garden . 
  its probably about 3x5 metres , and has a washing line , path , a christmas tree and a 10 year old rusty cheap bbq . 
  a couple of my neighbours have tables and the odd one has a security shed for a couple of bicycles but they are all very similar . 
  what are very popular here is allotments , which line the ` no build ' zones between residential areas and autobahns/railways . 
  to have one you usually legally have to use it to grow some form of foodstuff , but it 's very common to see a tiny portion given over to some tomatoes and the rest used for summer houses ( many permanent or semi ) , kids play equipment , lawns and flowerbeds and stuff . 
  these are especially popular with older ex east germans , as many of them say it was the only place they could go and be able to say and do what they wanted without the stasi or their informants on their backs !, 
  edit : i 've heard some american visitors compare the way these places look to ` miniture west coast ghetto style ' - theres a great example on google maps [ here ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/frankfurt/@50.108424,8.6021508,1015m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47bd096f477096c5:0x422435029b0c600!8m2!3d50.1109221!4d8.6821267 ), 
  i 've done it once or twice , always turns into a drunken argument about which shape from the guide is closest to the mess in our hands ... 
  should also probably add bleigiessen to this , which is a nye tradition . 
  this involves cooking up a spoonful of lead over a candle and then seeing what shape it forms , then matching the shape up to a website/book that tells you your future for the year . 
  i 'd agree , i mean you ca n't play schwebebahn simulator or any of the 5000 other weird simulators we germans seem to love on console . 
  even the console players i know , they do n't seem to play anything other than fifa for the most part . 
  but abbas still cool , right ? 
  dude , that 's just something we say to be polite . 
  really it 's the people there we want to avoid , not the animals . 
   and who will enter inside a churche in bikini ? 
  it 's something normal in germany ? 
  have you seen most of our churches ? 
  half of them look just like the local sport centre . 
  eurolines is a cross border operator . 
  if money is tight i 'd look south rather than north . 
  balkans are much cheaper for stuff like hostel accomodation and alcohol , and the hostels there tend to have more long term solo/couple travellers than places like munich and budapest that get full of groups of british , german , spanish and italians there to get drunk with their friends . 
  balkan flexipass does everything south of and east of croatia but not croatia itself , but i think might suit your needs - you buy a 5/10/15 day one and it allows you to use unlimited trains in the countries for that number of days in a month . 
  probably quite cheap to get a bus to bosnia and then flexipass from there , belgrade , athens , istanbul , sofia , varna ( beaches ) , bucharest , plovdiv and sarajevo all would probably interest you . 
  i used to live in istanbul , it 's very different from most of the other turkish cities , but nowadays has zones that have had huge amounts of migration from anatolia and you can easily see the difference with the people on the street once you have been there a few weeks , and they do n't get along too well with each other and tend to stay very divided , but to the average tourist this would not be easily discernable .
