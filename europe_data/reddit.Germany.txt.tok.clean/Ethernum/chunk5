  i have seen the lgb **** extended so far that you might as well write notahetman . 
  edit : i see i am not the only one having problems with the formating . 
  cheers . 
  * q = queer * + = lipservice to people we could not think of including but do n't want to offend . 
   the german law gives those benefits and denies adoption not really ... 
  if you neglect the advantageous tax classes , those benefits are given to people who actually raise children , not those who are just married . 
  so things like kindergeld is paid to parents regardless wether they are single , married or partnered . 
  adopting as a homosexual couple also kinda works . 
  see , the couple themselves ca n't adopt a child together . 
  but one of them can adopt one as a single parent , citing being in a stable relationship as a plus point . 
  the second parent can then adopt the child of the first one . 
  so yeah , madness . 
  this kind of circumventing tradition is done very often in germany . 
  you have one crowd that wants something changed , and one that is afraid of change , so we just reinvent the wheel and everybody is happy . 
  edit : in my opinion , we should legalize partnerships for both homo - and heterosexual couples and just forget about marriage alltogether . 
  religion and tradition aside , marriage is also the easiest and most common path to parenthood . 
  the german state is very invested in us having children . 
  cause nobody would vote for a politician citing god as their guide . 
  we ai n't ` murica . 
  but their conservative holding is very much christ-influenced . 
  paul krugman views something negative ? 
  wonderful !, 
  considering he has been consistantly wrong about everything , there can only be sunshine up ahead , 
  if this is true , what the fuck ... - . -, 
  that is too easy . 
  the colors were ... meh . 
  but the leather jacket was dope as hell . 
  are n't you like ... family with them ? 
  ** b ** ought ** m ** y ** w ** ife ** b ** reak ** m ** y ** w ** indshield ** b ** ig ** m ** oney ** w ** aste ** b ** umbling ** m ** echanical ** w ** reck ** b ** others ** m ** y ** w ** illy, 
  yeah , they look like mall cops now . 
  i miss the good old senfgelb with the leather jacket and the combat gloves . 
  i vote for test dazer . 
  confirmed : swedes are horrible people . 
  yes , i agree . 
  the title gore is just . . ugggh . 
  they could have gone with `` we should not support '' or something like this . 
  instead they went `` i , queen suzanne of britannia , disapprove of this ! '', 
  i find myself in agreement with a lot of what she writes . 
  this is a european problem , and one that demands a solution , not going around and playing the blame game . 
  not to mention that this endless back and forth makes us look silly and idiotic in the eyes of the rest of the world . 
  that 's true . 
  either keep everything imperial or metric . 
  do n't switch back and forth or combine them . 
  what do we do without suzanne moore 's support ?!, 
  we are doomed !, 
  doomed , you hear ?!, 
  man , does everyone writing for the guardian think they are the centre of the universe ? 
  thank you . 
  now s_he does not need to click the link . 
  i am so proud of you , and i bet your mum is too . 
  yeah . 
  this is as happy as she can look . 
  it 's not her fault genetics blessed her with a reversed smile . 
  i let wolfram alpha unfuck this and it does not really read any better : http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.0000506+wb%2flb%2fhz%5e2%2ft%5e2, 
  erm ... well , nasa once managed to loose an orbiter because of shenanigans with both systems . 
  never say never . 
  pound is like the weirdest unit . 
  there is the german bullshit pound that 's just half a kg , the american pound and the brits even have two of them . 
  one for cooking , one for payment . 
  does that means you guys are all half - [ saxons ] ( http://www.heute.de/zdf/zdfportal/blob/36734030/1/data.jpg ) ? 
  if yes ... 
  i 'm so , so sorry . 
  i wonder what he 's snickering about . 
  maybe he farted . 
   the total value of all hungarian banknotes in circulation amounted to 1/1 ,000 of one us dollar `` i 'd like one central european economy ! '', 
  `` that would be one dollar please ! '', 
  `` okay . 
  make it a take out . '', 
  they should color that black , red , gold and write german under it . 
  i 'd buy that . 
  and they should ... could you image what would happen to ordinary russians if lgbt folks and the russophobes band together ? 
  `` attention !, 
  straight couples or nuclear families passing through ! '', 
  maybe a whole lot of frenchmen are in denial ? 
  yup . 
  and if you are below 50 , do n't expect it to stay there . 
  i know . 
  it 's literally what i thought and what my face looked like when i thought it . 
  i did not feel disgust ... 
  it was more a mixture of confusion and joviality . 
  never heard of such a bet here . 
  do you guys do something like this in the uk ? 
  `` alright mate , let 's play a game . 
  you loose , i get to stick a wiener up your bum ? '', 
  needs more trickle down economy !, 
   of course they do , it 's a universal constant : haters gon na hate , rappers gon na homoerotically boast . 
  you fuckin what mate ? 
  i am from the streets of borgholzhausen !, 
  me and my homies will fuck your house up !, 
  aaah yes . 
  coconut and pecans !, 
  typical german ingredients !, 
  what the fuck ? 
  i found berlusconis shenanigans always very funny to watch . 
  but that is me , staring at the situation from the outside . 
  i guess he is pretty scary when he actually is your representant . 
  maybe they are paying off their tax dept with bunga bunga party invites ? 
  well the amount of government jobs is also supposed to be a lot more limited , forcing people to work in the private sector . 
  in greece you get the idea that there is a government job for everyone . 
  well that happens everywhere .
