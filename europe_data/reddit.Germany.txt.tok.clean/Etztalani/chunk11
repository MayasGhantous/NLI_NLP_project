  what ? 
  there are hardly any irish immigrants in germany . 
   as a parent i would give up ** all my rights ** including my life to protect my children my life yes , my rights no . 
  because rights are not something you can give up without effect the whole society negatively . 
  its not good to have a emotionally approach on this , because emotions are just a bad adviser . 
  these cases are very uncommon , in the last decade there were overall never over 500 murders/years in germany ( ** in 2015 = 296 ** ) and ** only a tiny fraction of them were rape and murders . 
  ** the statistics do n't justify what you 're suggesting also there is not a single legal measure which possibly could prevent these things to happen ever again . 
  there is no 100 % security and there never will be . 
  what does his political position even matter ? 
  we agree that this whole thing is disgusting right ? 
  fachwerkh\u00e4user are ok i guess , but is really beautiful about these pictures is imo how the architecture perfectly suits the surroundings and the nature ( which is also more diverse in italy ) around whereas fachwerkh\u00e4user often look a little like a foreign body that do n't belong there naturally . 
  italy , france , austria , swiss are the most beautiful countries imo . 
  but whats is really great about france and italy is that you have real mountains and sunny beaches . 
  you lucky bastards, 
  the 12 oct 2016 cover is just ingenious :d, 
  even-though i personally would consider the irgun terrorist a terrorist organistation your statement is incorrect . 
   [ there is no universal agreement on the definition of terrorism . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions . 
  moreover , governments have been reluctant to formulate an agreed upon and legally binding definition . 
  these difficulties arise from the fact that the term is politically and emotionally charged . 
  [ 3 ] to avoid this kind of confusion , the most common definition of terrorism is used , which includes the following : [ 4 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/definitions_of_terrorism ), 
  look i do n't dispute collective guilt of the german people but there are historical inaccuracies about your image of the shoa . 
  even-though a huge majority definitely knew about the killings ( but not every german ) your explanation of the reason of their knowledge is just wrong . 
  random fun fact : [ there are even muslims in north korea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhsuj47zqw ), 
  [ do you mean this guy ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/xxats0pfk4u?t=2m37s ), 
  but * your * sense of justice really does n't matter . 
  there are so many more important aspects which carry btw also far more weight in a constitutional jurisdiction than the sense of justice of individuals or even majorities . 
  they already are . 
  if gabriel would become chancellor we could recycle all these kohl-jokes and punchlines which alluded to his obesity , +1 for gabriel . 
  you ca n't compare merkel with clinton because even if you do n't like her you have to admit that she has integrity , authenticity and a total lack of vanity she is a scientist , sober and reserved and a political realist , she is actually pretty boring and that is what most germans like about a politician . 
  it definitely was n't meant that way . 
  what i meant with that is that probably not many germans could imagine in the early 30s , that hitler in power meant genocide and total war , butof course that makes them not less responsible . 
  also its apparent that they definitively knew that the voted for a racist , but i do n't think that a majority was aware of the huge scale of deadly implications of hitlers ideology in the early years . 
   killings on the eastern front . 
  these are completely different things . 
  please just reread my first comment :  concentration camps were no secret , unlike the death camps . 
  also many people knew about the ** mass executions of eastern europeans and jews in the occupied areas of the eastern front , because many ordinary solideres and not just ss-hardliners were involved in them . 
  ** also these mass executions were part of the shoa/holocaust . 
  so they are not completely different things  and wikipedia does n't give any numbers either . 
  of course some people knew , but apparently not enough to prove it was `` common '' . 
  your knowledge is very limited you really should read something to get up to date because its a fact that almost every wehrmachts soldier who fought on the eastern front knew of the mass executions because they were a part of it . 
  also they wrote about it to their family members . 
  or of course you can still life in your feelgood bubble . 
  i 'm really surprised , we had a whole lesson about nazi propaganda where we talked about all these movies , i assumed it was the general approach , but ofc in germany every state has its own educational plan so you never know . 
  of course i 'm , because i went to school in germany . 
  so you do n't have to give me a basic history lesson . 
  you really talking to the wrong guy , just read my other comments i wrote in this thread and you 'll figure that you really do n't have to tell me that  maybe you misinterpreted my comment , i just pointed out that there was german resistance to nazism and to point that out does n't mean that i do the thing you 're so tired of . 
  tell me where did i said that ? 
  its really uplifting and an honor that so many young israelis come to berlin . 
  [ concentration camps were no secret ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuzvy2ufwga ) , unlike the death camps . 
  also the conditions in concentration camps were to some degree known especially in cities like weimar , with several reported incidents of escaped prisoners , which clearly indicated that the population of weimar knew of the conditions in buchwald . 
  also many people knew about the mass executions of eastern europeans and jews in the occupied areas of the eastern front , because many ordinary solideres and not just ss-hardliners were involved in them . 
  i do n't know who you talking to , because i just wanted to make a joke so no need for your projections , straw-manning or conversion efforts to islamophobia . 
  i have in general a low opinion of religion therefore imo your whole buddhist example sucks . 
  [ if the whole wiki-article is called soviet offensive plans ** controversy ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_offensive_plans_controversy ) you probably should n't talk about it like there is a scientific consensus about it . 
   while most agree that stalin made extensive preparations for an eventual war and exploited the military conflict in europe to his advantage , the assertions that stalin planned to attack nazi germany in the summer of 1941 , and that barbarossa was a preemptive strike by hitler , are generally discounted according to david m. glantz . 
   the stable states ...  you mean like turkey ? 
  haha, 
  also when you say `` the germans '' did n't fight back you 're wrong , because there was [ german resistance to nazism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_resistance_to_nazism ), 
  actually a majority voted for him ( around 40 % ) the problem was that not many people were aware what actually would happen with hitler in power and at the time hated the democracy . 
  its not like that the shoa ( the industrial like killing of jews ) started immediately after hitler take office in 1933 , so he had time to abolish the loathed democracy and built a totalitarian state in which successful insurgency is almost impossible . 
  * to be honest i really was surprised that the total value numbers of the german reparation demands towards french were that high . 
  * 20 billion reichsmark ( 7.000 tons of gold ) = 2,5 trillion in today 's money and how much germany actually paid is controversial ( 7 % - 24 % ) , 5 billion franc ( 1,450 tons of gold ) so * germany * paid ** 490-1650 tons ** and * france * ** 1,450 tons ** . 
  but if you talk about economically harshness its more than a number of cash flow , because it depends on the overall economic condition of the national economy on which these reparations are imposed on , and also on other reparation demands that have economical impact , like the loss of the whole commercial fleet . 
   what held the germans back was not the economic hindrance of reparations but the instability of its countless governments which stresemann aided massively . 
  of course this played role but it is very controversial how much the reparation demands actually contributed to the political instability . 
  different historians have very different opinions about that , so its not as easy as you suggest . 
  also it is apparent that economy plays a huge role in general in regards of political stability . 
  of course the impact of great depression was more significant than the reparations , nevertheless its obvious that the huge reparation demands ( regardless of the actual outcome ) , have influenced the economy and its actors negatively and also contributed to the hyperinflation , which again influenced political stability at least at the first years of the weimar republic , giving it a bad start . 
   the terms inflicted on france were economically harsher then the treaty of versailles . 
  nope . 
  even if you just look at total numbers this is not true , but even if it was , for an evaluation of this kind you have to compare the economic situation after the great war to the situation in france after the franco-german war , ( which was n't by far as worse as the overall economic situation in whole europe after ww1 ) , . 
  also the most driving power of the idea of french revenge was n't based on economics . 
  social justice is per se a good thing , whereas extrem position and accusations towards groups of people is not . 
  when you start labeling a huge social group as egoists and fascist , because they are supposedly profiteers of the `` white supremacist patriarchy rape culture '' you do n't have to wonder when these people feel annoyed and vote for donald trump . 
  post factual era indeed . 
  the very week the paris terrorist attack was carried out german media was filed up with this fact ( also on front page ) of the use of refugee status by some attackers . 
  and there is no need to get salty btw . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34832512  the paris prosecutor 's office said fingerprints from the dead attacker matched those of a person who came to europe with migrants via the greek island of leros . 
  ** the man may have been posing as a syrian refugee . 
  no , if mountains are not hidden the local population usually gives them names , and how a mountain is called can differ a lot from case to case . 
  also there are climbed mountains which are mostly known for their geographic name like the second highest mountain k2 ( the k just stands for karakorum mountains . ), 
  the himalayas are very inaccessibly and therefore expeditions are very costly and dangerous . 
  also most of the extrem-mountaineers aim for 8.000 meter peaks because they 're considered the biggest challenge . 
  look at swiss and its francophone areas in comparisons to the parts where italien / german is spoken . 
  :d for the sake of my health i 'll start learning french . 
  await events , its not yet possible to determine how president trump actually will act in regards of foreign policy . 
  if you assume that mike pence has influence on trump in this matter there will be no change at all . 
  wiki :  pence supported the iraq war resolution , which authorized military action against iraq . 
  [ 196 ] during the iraq war , pence opposed setting a public withdrawal date from iraq . 
  during an april 2007 visit to baghdad , pence and john mccain visited shorja market , the site of a deadly attack in february 2007 , that claimed the lives of 61 people . 
  pence and mccain described the visit as evidence that the security situation in iraqi markets had improved . 
  [ 197 ] the visit to the market took place under tight security , including helicopters overhead , and the new york times reported that the visit gave a false indication of how secure the area was because of the extremely heavy security forces protecting mccain . 
  [ 198 ] pence chaired the house foreign affairs subcommittee on the middle east and was a prominent supporter of george w. bush 's iraq war troop surge of 2007 . 
  at the time , pence stated that `` the surge is working '' and defended the initial decision to invade in 2003 . 
  [ 196 ] pence has opposed closing the guantanamo bay detention camp and trying the suspected terrorists in the united states . 
  [ 199 ] as an alternative , pence has said that the `` enemy combatants '' should be tried in a military tribunal . 
  [ 199 ] pence has stated his support of israel and its right to attack facilities in iran to prevent the iranians from developing nuclear weapons , has defended the actions of israel in its use of deadly force in enforcing the blockade of gaza , and has referred to israel as `` america 's most cherished ally '' .
