  greek official : `` nah you 're dead . '', 
  ironically canada is very picky when it comes to immigrants/refugees . 
   if i beat a dog and the dog bites me i 'm not the victim . 
  this comparison is in fact racist , is n't it ? 
  nothing , they just ca n't drive after all they 're asians . 
  however wildfires with that many casualties happen quite often , whereas generally spoken fires in residential high-rises with that many casualties are relatively rare especially in the west , because they are actually easily preventable and not life-threatening with a sensible emergency plan , whereas for a wildfire you just need a dry-period and for example an idiot who throws his cigarette into a forest . 
  do n't get me wrong this still is devastating and it deserves attention , however you ca n't change much in order to prevent such things from happening . 
   but we have no mutual feeling stop saying `` we '' when you actually mean `` i '' . 
  more like a dystopia . 
   i 'm american and the only spd chancellor we talk about in modern european history classes is willy brandt . 
  because his [ ostpolitik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostpolitik ) was quite important for the trajectory of the cold war . 
  schmidt was also good chancellor , schr\u00f6der 's social policies , however are one of the reasons the spd is doing not so well over the last years . 
   a real alternative to merkel and cdu/csu . 
  something that is very difficult in germany generally spoken , just look at the average length our chancellors were in office . 
  merkel , kohl and adenauer together served for 42 years out of a total of 68 years . 
  that has more to do with german political culture and its emphasis on stability , than the failure of its opposition to provide a sensible alternative . 
  even-though spd indeed is doing quite bad atm , they just lost profile over the years . 
  oh sorry i read over that . 
   i also assume the diplomat pleaded immunity because a traffic accident like that would automatically trigger a criminal investigation in germany ? 
  yes that would make sense, 
  nah , after all over 64 % of germans think that merkel is doing a good job . 
  that is an approval rate few recent us presidents could achieve in their second term , in fact only eisenhower , reagan clinton and nixon and the latter ( obviously ) just for a very short period . 
  also before the refugee crisis it was over 70 % , only eisenhower achieved this in his second term . 
  maybe he was as corrupt as trump , but not as incompetent as him . 
  also worth to mention is that his wife committed suicide in 2001 . 
  even-though she had an serious disease , that reduced her quality of life significantly , there was rumors , that she developed a depression , because of how she was treated in the aftermath of the political donations scandal . 
  many years after that kohl 's son blamed merkel for her suicide . 
  when the terrorist group black september kidnapped and finally killed all the jewish athletes during the munich olympia '72 their demands included the liberation of the imprisoned head-figures of the rote armee fraktion the german left-wing terrorist organisation . 
   that 's why germany is a country where fathers think keeping their daughters chained in their basements and raping them makes them the good guys . 
  you confuse us with the austrians, 
   first of all , 40 % more people from the med route this year than last year in the same timeframe , and no resolution is in sight . 
  is n't that a logical consequence of the total shutdown of the balkan route ? 
  the total number atm is 45,000 . 
  in 2015 over 700,000 refugees entered europe over the balkan route . 
  ** when balkan route became usable the influx of med route decreased ** . 
  in fact the med route influx for 2014 in total was ** 170,000 ** . 
  at [ approximately the same time in 2014 ** more than 50,000 refugees reached italy . 
  ** ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/jun/10/migrants-crossing-the-mediterranean-key-numbers-libya-european ) ** when you look at the whole picture your number means jack-shit , its just a sensational number , that suits your narrative . 
  ** you could use any number totally out of context in order to promote a certain narrative , but is this is as factual as to not use any numbers at all and only discuss it * intuitively * . 
  ** the overall picture shows a huge decrease when it comes to total influx . 
  **  secondly , over 50 % of illegal immigrants ca n't be deported from germany . 
  that definitely is a problem . 
   if we do n't get our act together now in regards to who enters and stays , expect massive upheavals in the coming decades , and all for the worse . 
  agreed , however to build walls and let nobody in also is not the solution . 
  also its hard to predict the effect of global warming and how the picture , as a whole develops , to say we 're all doomed and it definitely will develop the worst possible way certainly is non factual but just fearmongering in order to justify * still premature * harsh measures , because atm the situation improves . 
   you are still the same stubborn , arrogant people who always seem to know how everyone else should run their countries . 
  ironically that is what you 're are doing the whole time . 
  that 's an alarming and apparent viewpoint . 
  in the exact way we 're doing it now ? 
  again we already decreased immigrant influx . 
  btw . 
  your scenario is totally fictional , i hope you 're not that delusional to actually believe that you can look into the future . 
  have you even read what i wrote ? 
   not really , saudis would probably look at you and say the same . 
  also this is total bs , there are metrics that objectivize , if the laws of different countries are just , nondiscriminatory and generally stable . 
  stop with that relativism , just because it fits your agenda . 
  i never said its impossible to stop migration . 
  in fact it already * was * decreased and other policy making is underway to decrease it further . 
  do n't pretend we are still at the climax of the refugee crisis . 
  i said it is legally hard to expel the refugees who already * have obtained * an asylum status . 
  learn to read . 
  germany is a state of law , saudi arabia is not . 
  german laws are designed to prevent injustice and discrimination . 
  saudi arabian laws promote injustice and discrimination . 
  german laws protect democracy , saudi arabian laws protect an absolute islamist monarchy . 
  see the difference ? 
  [ the guardian article ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/germany-extremist-violence-far-right-left-islamist ) [ total numbers of extremists ] ( https://www.google.de/imgres?imgurl=https%3a%2f%2fsciencefiles.files.wordpress.com%2f2015%2f12%2fextremistisches-personenpotenzial.png%3fw%3d630&amp;imgrefurl=https%3a%2f%2fsciencefiles.org%2f2015%2f12%2f12%2f&amp;docid=fulyslphs508wm&amp;tbnid=dzavb0qvzr9lgm%3a&amp;vet=10ahukewi38erwgcduahvdxhqkhudockoqmwghkaawaa..i&amp;w=630&amp;h=630&amp;bih=1055&amp;biw=2133&amp;q=politischer%20extremismus%20deutschland%20statistik&amp;ved=0ahukewi38erwgcduahvdxhqkhudockoqmwghkaawaa&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ) [ crimes by extremist group ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=political+extremism+germany&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewirhvingcduahxdobqkhdebchqq_auibygc&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1055&amp;dpr=0.9#tbm=isch&amp;q=politischer+extremismus+deutschland+statistik&amp;imgrc=plh54lxsiykaqm: ), 
  however in a stable democracy you have institutions that exist exactly for the purpose to prevent this to happend :  laws are fluid , and easily suspended for reasons of political convenience . 
  its called checks and balances in order to achieve this goal you would have necessarily weaken and undermine these institution and that basically means to weaken and undermine a democracy as a whole , with unforeseeable consequences . 
  even if a german party would be able to achieve this ( which i consider unlikely ) , it 's not worth it , in fact i could n't imagine any event which would render this scenario desirable . 
   still a problem like right-wing and left-wing extremism as well . 
  it would decrease their income , since they could n't sell their media rights exclusively anymore i guess . 
  blablah stop repeating ( stupid ) thoughts of other people and develop own opinions , this is so cliche that there are only two option either you 're a troll or really really boring and stupid . 
  maybe he has a stroke and we should call 911 . 
  it really is amusing when people try to break down a tremendously complex and intertwined problem , with just pointing fingers in one direction . 
  my personal favorite : `` us interventionism caused that all '' ( very popular among my compatriots ) also honorable mentions : - israel is the root of all evil - european colonialism - russian interventionism because it has to be the fault of a single country/culture/ideology , that everything is so fucked up . 
  lol, 
   it 's silly and hypocritical to act as if germany is targeting foreigners than you really should have watched german tv during the election-campaign , because plenty of csu politicians advertised it with `` the foreigners '' argument, 
  wake up sheeple the evil foreigners destroying our sch\u00f6ne autobahnen , because they dare to drive on them !, 
  enough is enough !, 
  lets build new autobahnen an let the foreigners pay for it !, 
  i definitely see no populism at work here . 
  haha i like you . 
  i agree with you , the recent interventions in the middle east definitely failed intermediate-term to stabilize the region , but if you take a look on its history , that actually would have been , geopolitical spoken , a significant landmark , like the french revolution , the first and the second world war or the disintegration of the soviet union . 
  i mean sure there are plenty of circumstances surrounding these interventions , which are legitimately criticisable , especially regarding the iraq war , which was justified with ( as we now know ) blatant lies . 
  nevertheless people tend to oversimplify what stability in the context of the middle east actually means , because its instability is a product of many layers , that exist parallel but also are intertwined , like the sunni-shia conflict , the proxy war between saudi-arabia and iran and even legacy issues emanating from : - the colonial era - the israeli-arab-conflict and - the cold war . 
  not no intervene certainly would n't stabilize the region magically . 
  the question is if these interventions actually deteriorated things and that is imo a question not answerable as easy as many people pretend it is . 
  what a great day for delusional , paranoid , antisemitic conspiracists . 
  also it is perfect to learn french , because both languages are available . 
  that movie is great !, 
  arte really shows good movies . 
  arte has so many different things , it shows you the beautiful gardens all over the world , then the best documentaries about the syrian civil war i have ever seen , european movies , thematic weeks about specific directors like kurosawa or scorsese , not just airing their movies but also background documentaries about their work . 
  there is something for everyone . 
  are you sure you do n't confuse luxemburgish with german ? 
  i understand almost every word of their luxemburgish it really sounds like a very strong dialect even though its considered a language . 
  i used to live in trier and trier dialect pronunciations are quite similar to luxemburgish , but the latter is more difficult to understand and you do n't understand everything if they speak fast . 
  but the girl , who spoke german ( 3:30 ) had almost no accent at all . 
  i also often was in luxemburg and if they speak german they usually speak perfect high german , just some nuances attract attention . 
  here their mp speaks [ german ] ( https://youtu.be/tblafxtq2_w?t=13m32s ) and here he speaks [ luxemburgish ] ( https://youtu.be/-yqwhqmurli?t=42s ),
