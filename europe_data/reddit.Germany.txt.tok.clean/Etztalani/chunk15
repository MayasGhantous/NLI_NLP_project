  but its not obligatory for judge to reduce the sentence . 
  and because it was 20 x attempted murder i think it relatively likely that he wo n't reduce it . 
  it does n't matter anyhow at least de facto . 
  for attempted murder he 'll probably get a lifelong prison sentence anyhow and there is no higher possible imprisonment in german jurisdiction . 
  greed also qualifies as a murder criterion ( that is why he will be prosecuted for attempted-murder ) and therefore there is a `` besondere schwere der schuld '' regardless whether he gets charged for terrorism or not . 
  also if he gets convicted for attempted-murder he will get a lifelong prison sentence ( and there is no higher conviction in german jurisdiction as lifelong imprisonment ) , so he would n't get any defacto extra punishment for terrorism as well . 
  me for my part would like to read russian literature in original :p, 
  i read him and i can recommend everyone to read to him too , because he did n't wrote like a philosopher but more like a literary man , which makes his books wroth the while even if you do n't want to focus on his philosophy . 
  his style is very suggestive and powerfully eloquent . 
  i guess he could easily become a champion of world literature as well . 
  good old british balance of power policy . 
  i did n't meant that referenda like the brexit referendum should require a 2/3 majority or that referenda in general should require it . 
  i meant that referenda about the core elements of a political system ( like in turkey ) should require it , because it should n't be so easy to change a whole political - system and constitution . 
  and i agree 100 % with your conclusions , but the last . 
   not everybody gets their way in a democracy . 
  if your side loses , just be glad that you got to cast a vote at all . 
  that is not the way i see it , democracy should n't be about black and white elections between two poles , but about an arrangement between these two poles , if a political opinion has a huge lasting majority , it will prevail sooner or later over the other as a result of `` normal '' political processes , which do n't climax in a dividing element with less heat and impulsiveness . 
  surely there is a cultural dimension about it and maybe it fits into gb political culture and i just do n't get it , nevertheless i remain skeptical about it . 
  he indeed is very handsome . 
  that is the main-problem about referenda , because when the decision is very close you will ignore almost 50 % of the population ( and coming generation who have to life for the longest time with the decision ) . 
  brexit , turkish presidential referendum , scottish independence ... all these decision were very close even-though they have a huge impact on 100 % of the population , therefore they have the potential to tear a society apart , without offering an easy path towards reconciliation . 
  even the us presidential election system is similar . 
  i really detest absolute polarization , but on the other hand a democratic society has the right to be self-determined and but ofc when it comes to considerable changes of the constitution the obstacle a referendum has to take should clearly be a 2/3 majority , in order to prevent the death of a democracy . 
  proponents of referenda say its the most democratic vote there is , but i 'm not sure about that . 
  yes he is . 
  in the past he called putin often a flawless democrat . 
  they have a good relationship . 
  since he is putin 's lobbyist he became quite unpopular in germany , sometimes he tries to influence current politics in favor of russia e.g. 
  he said that germany should not sanction russia for the ukrainian war , luckily few people actually think that his concerns are rooted in sensible political consideration but his own economic interests , therefore his voice is n't considered very trustworthy and german media is as critical about him as you are . 
  so many german speakers ... is it your second foreign language in school ? 
  merkel advantage is that she is down-to-earth , for a politician she has an amazing lack of vanity and she is authentic , long story short she is boring , but i prefer her over any career driven charismatic but narcissistic `` strahlemann '' . 
  modesty and authenticity are actually trades germans seem to value a lot in politicians , that 's also why steinmeier became the most popular minister in the current cabinet , even-though he is n't actually charismatic , because of his restrained level-headed way to think and talk . 
  actually the spd is a centrist party with a left-wing tendency , they are pragmatist not ideologists . 
  their most left-leaning wing even separated from them ( and finally became the most centrist oriented wing within dielinke the actual leftists ) , because when in office their policies were too pragmatic . 
  even-though schulz wants to revoke the very reforms that were the reason for the separation and even-though he is probably more left leaning than schr\u00f6der was , the spd is as left-wing as the cdu is a conservative party . 
  they are both centrists with tendencies to the right respective left-wing political spectrum . 
  its not like that he gave him a real diagnosis ( which is quite impossible without face-to-face examination ) , he just made a educated guess based on the material that was available to him , but that is no diagnosis in a pathological sense . 
  yeah its really cringy . 
  they did n't stopped there , i mean they dropped one of them from a plane with name `` enola gay '' its like they intentionally wanted to make generations of teenager pupils giggle in history class . 
   i do n't think `` we currently think this way , but i would much rather like we think that way '' is the way to go . 
  also its not like the school of thoughts produce worldviews in a vacuum , they are hugely effected by historical circumstances , technology and scientific knowledge . 
  i really do n't believe so much in vanguard-ism of `` intellectuals '' who form the thought of their contemporaries . 
  capitalism , globalization and modern technology have imo by far a more eroding effect to ancient values and the way we view the world , than any lengthy book that e.g. 
  sartre wrote , because actually people like sartre are the echo chamber of the zeitgeist/reality and not vise-versa . 
  at the moment insights of physics just confirm the limitation of the human brain to really understand how the world works . 
  quantum mechanics questions our general ability to recognize objective truth , if even in physics truth depends on what the examiner is looking at respectively what he is not looking at , why should there be any recognizable objectives truth in our every day life ? 
  i learned russian in school and the difference between kyrill and latin is actually very tiny . 
  they are both related to each other . 
  in opposition to arabic , hebrew or chinese alphabets its almost intuitive for somebody whose native language uses the latin letters , because many letters and sounds are exactly the same ( sometimes a kyrill letter conveys a sound that is conveyed with a different letter in latin the kyrill p - is the latin r ) or sounds that are also very frequent in germanic or romantic languages are conveyed by one letter instand of several ones e.g. 
  - \u042f is just - ja or \u0448 is - sch/sh - \u0445 - ch if you put real effort into it you can learn kyrill in less than a week . 
  i guess it is accordingly easy to interchange these systems , without much difficulty for the population to adapt . 
  but there is certain german radical left-wing faction , that has a particular hate towards the german state . 
  the call themselves [ anti-germans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-germans ) and they wave us and israel flags on protests or ( ironically ) even fly [ bomber harris banners ] ( https://www.google.de/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.allmystery.de%2fi%2ft738e35_0.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3a%2f%2ftruth-zone.net%2fforum%2fgeneral-discussion%2f63386-what-to-do-with-germany.html&amp;docid=-1cx1lxnmg-gjm&amp;tbnid=a0yzqy4samtxom%3a&amp;vet=10ahukewjgszlk3kxtahwhllakhysodxcqmwgkkaewaq..i&amp;w=480&amp;h=360&amp;bih=1055&amp;biw=2133&amp;q=anti%20german%20bomber%20harris&amp;ved=0ahukewjgszlk3kxtahwhllakhysodxcqmwgkkaewaq&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8 ) . 
  agreed, 
  [ what about this ? ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1kzmwo3ee ), 
  that indeed makes sense . 
  kuschner is definitely the lesser evil , even-though he is very enigmatic he seems sensible , but maybe i just projecting my own hopes . 
  xd no need to resort to his own intelligence services . 
  they should n't be able to exactly explain to him how the relationship between two foreign countries look like , its not their job and their billion dollar budgets has only the purpose to undermine his efforts . 
  remember ronald reagan ? 
  his economic policy was called [ neo-liberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neoliberalism ) . 
  in europe when you talk about liberalism you mean liberal markets . 
  did he changed his mind , because he thoughtfully reconsidered the situation and came to conclusion that there is a necessity to question his beliefs in order to achieve objectives of a comprehensive considered foreign political strategy or did he just changed his mind out of impulsivity . 
  for the first time western leaders unanimously affirmed and even welcomed his policies whereas his relations to russia deteriorated . 
  no worries . 
  no i do n't know him tbh i 'm deeply ashamed to admit , that i know far to few architects . 
  i just read about vauban , who apparently was a military engineer , which sounds cool , now i 'm reading the wiki article of citadel of besan\u00e7on lol . 
  i know , i meant who is most famous * in * germany not who is the most famous german . 
  i think most people know eiffel because literally everyone knows the eiffel tower . 
  i think one of the most famous in germany is [ gustave eiffel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustave_eiffel ) and of course [ albert speer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_speer ) although he is considered first a nazi and than an architect , [ walter gropius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walter_gropius ) also comes to mind . 
  i thought about your question and something came to my mind . 
  its not not monuments but [ traditional student fraternities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burschenschaft ) , which are remain controversial . 
  its comparable to statues of confederate leaders , because how you are assess them hugely depends where you stand on the political spectrum . 
  burschenschaften are highly connected to german history , they started as an avant-garde movement for german nationalism in the 19th century and to some degree contributed to the formation of a german national state . 
  conservatives and right-wingers tend to emphasis their raison d'\u00eatre with exact these historical events , whereas nowadays they 're accused of being sexist , nationalist and part of the far-right by lefties . 
  ( and in my opinion not unjustified , although it really is n't black and white and there is a huge spectrum of different fraternities . ), 
  from the nazi era ? 
  no , not that i 'm aware of and if they are they are memorials for the victims of nazism or museums with a similar purposes like [ the nazi party rally grounds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_party_rally_grounds ) . 
  however some monuments from the monarchy are still there like [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyffh%c3%a4user_monument ) , but all the bad things that happend during the monarchy are overshadowed by the crimes that happend during nazism so nobody really cares about them . 
  no i do n't think so , it 's totally ok in my opinion . 
  it would be equally stupid to call out an austrians or swiss for using their formal standard german or words that are unique to their dialects . 
  sure in favor of simplicity and comprehensibility it should n't be exaggerated when you write/talk in an international context , but that is definitely not the case , as long as you use consciously as many words you can , that are unique to your dialect . 
  i do n't think that the difference between ae and be spelling is serve enough to render communication impassible , therefore he just is a cunt . 
  i lived in rhineland-palatinate where people in comparison are quite outgoing ( my neighbors actually talked to me lol ) at least in comparison where i 'm from . 
   so everything is now the sexist patriarchy 's fault . 
  women have no choice and are all conditioned to be the way men want them . 
  alright that 's is a strawman , you reduce the reality that has a grayish appearance to the black and white question of the key issue of free will vs. determinism , however [ compatibilism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compatibilism ) easily reconciles the fact that women have a choice , but still face sexism . 
  is n't it mostly you guys who call themselves `` american '' , while just referring to their us citizenship ? 
  and i really think op meant a stereotypical us citizen and not a stereotypical person from both american continents , because ( obviously ) someone like that does n't exist , because of the huge cultural difference between north - central and latin american countries , because of that same reason there is no stereotypical european . 
  until yesterday i was in italy and what is even more beautiful than your magnificent architecture and beautiful landscapes is your people and their warmth in everyday interactions . 
  you get some many smiles just for saying buongiorno . 
  this pickup artist language ( like the whole ` movement ' ) really is ridiculous, 
  i do n't think catcalling is a thing in germany . 
  it definitely is not in the region i live , however i imagine that it could be a thing in the western regions or in brandenburg/berlin since these regions have the reputation of a mentality that is a little bit more outgoing and communicative with strangers in general . 
  i lived for a while in rhineland-palatinate and never witnessed it , though . 
  anyway to exchange looks with strangers ( foreigners may call it shameless staring ) is really a thing in germany and that can definitely lead to nonverbal flirting sometimes . 
  tell me europe why does europe not start ww3 in order to oust trump instead of taking in refugees ? 
  like the chief terrorist in die hard who irl was a british alchemy professor, 
  like the german terrorists in die hard .
