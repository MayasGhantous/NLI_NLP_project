   ** post ** cold war, 
   well so far the consequences in terms of human lifes lost etc. 
  of the ukrainian war is nothing compared to us wars all over mena ... 
  but that 's not solely the fault of the us . 
  the reason for this is that various regional powers ( iran , saudi-arabia , turkey , israel etc. ), 
  and non-regional powers ( us , russia ) are involved in these conflicts as well . 
  there is a huge proxy war going on between saudi-arabia and iran , which has a sectarian dimension . 
  a proxy-war means always involvement of various non-states , militias and terrorist groups who give a shit about the geneva conventions , because there are no possibilities to hold them accountable , therefore the tendency to escalate conflicts until they spiral out of control . 
  look at syria ( which is btw . 
  not an `` us war '' ) myriads of non-state actors , a sectarian dimension ( therefore a proxy war between iran and saudi arabia ) , direct involvement ( airstrike or ground troops ) of turkey , russia , us , israel , iran , eu indirect financial involvement of basically any other mena state . 
  that is basically the reason for the high casualties . 
  so basically its an ironic joke that questions the survey by claiming an ironic connection of its good results and the relatively high rates of clinical depression in denmark . 
   the point is that many eu countries already have citizenship by descent , and unless it also includes adopted children it is effectively genetically based immigration . 
  nah it has nothing to do with genetics , because the only thing that matters is former citizenship of your immediate ancestors ( grandparents ) and that as well includes ashkenazi jews or other minorities , who happend to be citizens of a european nation . 
  doing him a favor would have been to correct his grammatical mistakes and comfort him . 
  your comment was just rude . 
  nah , religion was just an explanation for the inherent inclination towards morality of the human race . 
  morality was there before religion , in fact morality appears to be a logical consequence of evolution like culture itself and astonishingly both phenomena are not a characteristic limited to the human race . 
  religion did n't spread morality or even invented it , it was there before . 
  staring shameless at total strangers . 
  i live in bavaria but went to school in thuringia , in general from what i heard , in the former gdr states you can choose between french/spanish and russian as a 2nd foreign language . 
  but it makes sense since there are still a lot of russian teachers , after all it was taught as the first foreign language in gdr schools , they did n't just disappeared with the reunification . 
  german , english and russian, 
  well its not required to be totally uncritical and in favor of every aspect ( regardless if true or not ) of a country to become a citizen , europe is not north korea or something . 
  citizenship does n't require blind obedience . 
  i hate these kind of argument because it is actually no real argument . 
  you can say anything about any country regardless if you are foreign to it or not as long as this country has freedom of speech . 
  its just a way to deny the validity of ones opinions just because he is a foreigner in order not to think about real arguments or express one 's opinion and therefore possibly give room for a discussion , long story short it 's very lazy . 
  man , can you read his thoughts or what ? 
  what you are doing here is nothing but straw-manning and not even creative one , its lazy and boring . 
  also it does n't matter at all if he is from mena or not because we 're atm discussing something totally different you 're as bad as the average right-winger who tries to uses any ( unjustified ) opportunity to hijack a post that initially was n't ( at last ) about the contemporary controversy of muslim immigration at all to push for an agenda . 
  push not discuss . 
  its like screaming at a random stranger you randomly ( for whatever reason ) choose to be a personification of your enemy image , but who 's political views are in fact totally unknown to you . 
   in special if you play in the evening , you look dangerouse as hell . 
  or just mental . 
  i would n't say that context matter , because , why would anyone ever say this sentence and actually meaning the jelly doughnut ? 
  in exception for being intentionally funny , but since we 're germans that never ever actually happens . 
  [ pretty good explanation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aima2f6jmve ), 
  its not only popular , its pretty much the standard . 
  when you order water in a restaurant you have to explicitly say not carbonated one , if you want one without . 
  no they are elected , just not directly by the population . 
  what is the worst is when the subtitles are a little bit different from what they actually saying and asynchronous . 
  i mean its not that bad in english , but atm i try to learn french that way and it really can get annoying . 
  how could this child become part of this society then ? 
  if the parents really want to determine the views of a child ( something that is actually quite questionable ) they also can talk with the child about the thing they learn in school and that they a disagree in certain topics and why they do . 
  it does n't harm anyone to be confronted with the pluralism of thinking and identities , to deny a child access to this is hardly a good pro-argument for homeschooling . 
  they love that . 
  they would gladly annex bavaria and some bavarians would be glad to be annexed . 
  well in germany its almost obligatory to visit a concentration camp while in school . 
  when you already stood in a gas chamber or a crematorium where hundreds of thousands or people were killed or their bodies burned , you become quite involved the historical fact of the shoa . 
  even-though i make jokes about it with my ( close ) friends we never trivialize it . 
  turks trying to [ imitate ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.com/locationphotodirectlink-g187323-d2318443-i98841895-voner-berlin.html ) german [ d\u00f6ner . 
  ] ( http://europizzaburghausen.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=62&amp;product_id=89 ), 
  i would n't say that is generally true . 
  some sociologists argue that terrorism is a multichannel communication strategy ( sounds stupid , but is not total nonsense ) therefore a terrorist act can have many different intentions depending on the different recipient it targets . 
  islamic terrorism surely want to spread fear among the general western public , but also demonstrate power and capability among their fighters and sympathizes as a means of propaganda . 
  left-wing terrorism however also often aims for sympathy among the general public and even try to legitimize their acts , as an avant-garde component of the class-war in order to spark a revolution ( therefore they aim for public support to some degree ) in theory the recipient of the fear aspect of its terrorism are the elites they try to topple , therefore there targets are often representatives of the respective elite that is in power and other bogeymen , therefore left-wing terrorism in western europe targeted in the past politicians , bankers / economists etc. 
  in syria the huge agglomeration are all in the west , isis played no relevant role there . 
  its assad , russia , iran and hisbollah against fsa and the jihadist opposition ( but not isis ) . 
  there the huge majority of casualties were produced . 
  lets not overestimate isis , after all in syria isis never had more than 35,000 fighters and therefore was the smallest faction in the war , it controls the desert , huge territories in km \u00b2 , but only a tiny proportion of syria population lives there . 
   deport all illegal aliens . 
  i agree with you lets restore america like it was in 1491 . 
  i have no sex because german women only want to sleep with arabs . 
  do n't worry we 'll buy them air tickets and send them over the pond , like we did in 2001 . 
  the whole region was fucked up before , france and great britain contributed during the period of imperialism . 
  like spain and portugal in latin-america , which even-though already a lot better than 10,20,30 years still is n't stable . 
  and lets not forget about how european nations fucked up africa , germany played its part there as well . 
  surely saddam was not a stabilizing factor for the region as well . 
  he started two wars , one of them produced more casualties as the iraq war . 
  the only mistake they made was not to oust him in the 90s when there was an actual justification . 
  the bombing of the us in syria hardly is the reason for people to leave their country . 
  [ wernher von braun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjdesgzlbio ), 
  after all gandhi was assassinated by an hindu nationalist extremist . 
  since the shut down of the balkan route the logical consequence is ** that the influx decreased overall . 
  ** i mean in ** 2015 over 700.000 used it to reach europe ** , even-though since this shut down there ** is an increase of influx through the mediterranean route * ( 181.000 in 2016 and 60.000 up to june this year ) * , there is an overall ( huge ) decrease of influx from 2015-2017 . 
  ** there is the possibility of an increase in 2017 in comparison to 2016 , if so probably only a tiny one * ( relatively spoken ) * through the mediterranean route . 
  the ** so far influx of 2017 was a little below the mediterran route influx of 2014 ** * around the same time * ( when the balkan route was n't as relevant as in 2015 ) , whereas the ** overall influx of 2016 ( 181.000 ) ** was higher than the ** influx of 2014 ( 170.000 ) ** . 
  but in 2016 the balkanroute was n't closed completely yet , ** ( from january till may 2016 over 150.000 refugees reached greece - from january till june 2017 only around 7.000 refugees reached greece ) ** but the influx only was significantly decreased whereas in 2017 it is closed therefore ** there will be an overall decrease in 2017 in comparison to 2016 **, 
  also for some holland refers to whole netherlands haha . 
  i would not say that it is generally true , even-though austrians and germans are definitely more direct , but that does n't mean we do n't get more subtle hints at all . 
  i probably would get that hint , but i 'm also straightforward enough to make at least a sarcastic joke about that hint . 
  `` what you are from the us ?!? ... 
  in germany there are definitely anti-us sentiments . 
  there is a considerable amount of people , who blame the us for the instability in the middle east as a result of us interventionism , especially the iraq war is regarded as a political failure and the root of all evil for the current situation in the me , ofc these people oversimplify and do n't know what stability in the context of the middle east actually means . 
  there definitely is mistrust towards us policy making , however obama was liked , well at least until prism , which some people regarded as a proof that you ca n't trust the us . 
  i would n't say that the average us-citizen is hated , though . 
  ofc there are a lot of cliches and a lot of them depict us-citizens as stupid or lunatics , overly-patriotic in an unhealthy way and ignorant . 
  it get coverage , but limited on . 
  you have to frequent the world-news category of online newspapers , to find news about it , but even there you wo n't find much or at least not enough to actually really understand the conflict and its trajectory . 
  i mean not even the syrian civil war is covered comprehensively , short of the fight against isis and possible turning points ( e.g. 
  gas-attacks , homs etc. . ) and russian and us-led coalition relations you wo n't see many events covered by german news media . 
  i only really love the tops , when i was a child i never told my mom that i hate it , just because i wanted to eat the delicious tops , after a while my mom figured though , she got suspicious because every-time i just ate the tops and told her i 'm not hungry anymore haha . 
  also crime rates are higher in cities . 
  when you get socialized in a big cities it also has negative impact on your mental health . 
  firstly it promotes depression when you move there as an adult and also there are studies that proof that the size of the city you grow up in correlates with the likelihood to suffer of schizophrenia in your adulthood , regardless if you move to more rural areas later on . 
  no these two regions are the reason why there probably never will be an independent bavaria, 
  bavaria also is not homogeneous , its northern parts are populated by franconians ( 1/3 of its total population ) , who are culturally very different from austrians . 
  also there is swabia ( almost 2 million inhabitants ) where are majority does n't speak the bavarian dialect . 
  i do n't feel guiltily about it in fact i 'm quite patriotic about the way modern germany deals with its own history and how we are aware of it .
