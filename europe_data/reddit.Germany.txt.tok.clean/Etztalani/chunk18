  identity is to some degree always about the history of one 's own nation , but only with self-awareness comes real confidence , therefore no need to feel guilty about it . 
  actually i think if you try to ignore something you feel guilty , but just do n't want to admit it . 
  put a canadian flag on your rucksack and pretend that you are canadian / s yes , these people actually exist . 
  i 'm still waiting for the obligatory comment of a french and how they usually behead their royal family . 
  i 'm not sure if people actually realize it or not , but [ franka potente ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004376/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) is german, 
  etztala is used in the franconian dialect as a filler word , actually its just dialect form of `` jetzt '' - now , however `` jetzt '' in high-german is not used as a filler word usually . 
  i added - ani because i thought it sounds good . 
  i 'm franconian also `` etztala '' became quite popular because of a franconian metalhead who makes stupid youtube videos his name is [ der drachenlord . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/kllorfso7xq?t=11s ) who actually has no fans but only haters . 
  his videos are a guilty pleasure of mine . 
  you 're right ofc to call the 30 year war itself a civil war is a little bit over the top , however the 30 year war it-self was a bunch of conflicts that merged and finally escalated to a full-scale continental war . 
  i just wanted to make a point that this :  when so many others were involved is in general no disqualifier for a civil war . 
  even-though the majority , of fighters involved in the syrian civil war indeed are syrians , the numbers change when you put military equipment , instruction and the percentage of airstrikes by country into the account , which in modern warfare are very decisive . 
  also you have a huge merger with the iraq civil war and spillovers to other countries in its proximity . 
  still not comparable to an open conflict of two major powers on syrian soil , though . 
   when so many others were involved you mean like the syrian civil war ? 
  also anything is immediately considered racist in the us and that distracts sometimes the focus from the real problem . 
  like the police killing black people , in many cases it was hard to determine wehter the problem really was racism or just insufficient training to mange certain situations and the general trigger-happiness of us police forces , which could possibly be rooted in insufficient training and the omnipresence of guns . 
  these debates/backlashes are to emotionally imo . 
  we really do n't need a racial debate comparable to the one taking place in the us , because how this debate takes place in the us in fact is very toxic . 
  political correctness actually is quite the opposite of acknowledgeing the problem , it just sensitives words without really changing anything . 
  comedian saying the word nigga has nothing to do with racism . 
  in fact louis c.k. 
  said it in order to make a point against racism . 
  to use it and actually make people aware of a problem is so much better than just snub at anyone who uses it regardless of the context . 
  no , because ethnicity has nothing to do with race but culture . 
  for example i have a racially asian mate , who was culturally socialized in franconia , he speaks with the franconian accent and culturally spoken he identifies himself as a german-franconian his ethnicity is therefore german , another friend of mine was culturally socialized in poland , therefore his identity is polish . 
  the us is this huge melting pot , where a lot of 2,3,4,5 , . . x. generation immigrants still identify as italo , irish , latin etc. 
  - american , this also exists in europe of course but ultimately our policies aim for integration and to some degree even for cultural assimilation , something that is considered inherently racist in the us , but not so much in europe since the histories are different . 
  i was n't offended by it , also i know that some people prefer to be very explicit and direct with their responses and i have no problem with that at all . 
  nevertheless its not polite , however i do n't consider it my task to tell other people what is `` good '' or `` bad '' . 
  in my opinion in general to be more diplomatic would be a good approach within this sub , since it is more or less about cultural exchange , but that 's only my humble opinion and i again i do n't consider it my task to tell grown-ups what they should/shouldn ' t do . 
  therefore i 'm totally fine with your impoliteness , however i equally understand ppl who are not and call you out on that , but then they should do it with the same politeness that they expect from you and also they should refrain to speak in favor of others , whose actual opinion are virtually unfamiliar to them . 
  nevertheless these federations were unstable disunited quarreling mini-states , with emphasis on their regional identity . 
  divided even confessional wise . 
  usually civil-war is the great exception within a united nation / state , however when it comes to the history of hre it was the norm , because of it 's total lack centralism , that is why there was neither the german state or the german nation until 1871 . 
  in every major european conflict , there were germans fighting germans , because different mini-states allied themselves with different great-powers for different reasons . 
  some major european conflicts were even caused by this instability and the prussian-austrian dualism . 
  to be fair , the response of the danish guy was in fact not really polite and everyone can call anyone out for that , regardless from where they come from . 
  he just pushed it a little bit too far imo , because after all no austrian/german complained about his statement therefore nobody felt misrepresented . 
  yes but there was no germany , because all of the things you mentioned are no equivalent to a national state like france was for centuries . 
  germany specifically refers to * a * german national state and there was none until 1871 . 
  was it or was it not the case that the old standard was german speakers were german ? 
  am i right?pure ethnicity bullshit ? 
  was it or was it not the case that the old standard was german speakers were german ? 
  am i right ? 
  however , this is bs . 
  you are german , when you speak the language and you were culturally socialized in germany . 
  you are austrian/belgian/namibian / french/ukrainian/italian ( or south tyrolese ) / luxembourgian/liechtensteiner/swiss when you speak german but are culturally socialized in the respective country . 
  you do n't even know who he is , there are a lot of people in this sub who use a flair that does n't represent their complex cultural background . 
  he even could be an ethically danish guy who lives on german soil as a [ minority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_minority_of_southern_schleswig ) , but still has german citizenship . 
  he could be a german living in danmark , or he just have traveled a lot through germany and austria . 
  i do n't feel misrepresented by his statements at all and you should n't call people out on something that does n't concern you . 
  well before bismark there was actually no germany . 
  i think that only is possible when you actually leave your home to live and fully immerse in the foreign language during your childhood , like when you are between 6 and 10 years old . 
  a lot of my friends came from poland and russia to germany and only the ones who came during their childhood have ( almost , there are sometimes still nuances that are different , that you 're actually only realize when you know the background and really pay attention ) no accent . 
  a friend of mine came when he was 13 y.o. 
  to germany , had german as his first foreign language in poland , now he lives in germany for almost 15 years and still has an accent , that clearly reveals his slavic origins . 
  i think it is almost impossible to get rid of your accent in a foreign language especially one that is not from the same linguistic family as your native language , when you 're over a certain brink when it comes to age . 
  maybe with intensive professional help from a speech therapist , but is that really worth the while ? 
  i disliked the focus on the terrorist group . 
  i think a much better way to make a movie out of it , is to portray these events out of the perspective of buback , helmut schmidt and the police forces . 
  also the time period was too long , they tried to depict the whole history of the raf from its foundation ( even tried to explain the circumstances of the time ) till the german autumn . 
  to let the movie start as typical legal thriller for the first 20 minutes or so and then let everything spiral out of control would have been a lot more on point and dense . 
  anything related to the [ rote armee fraktion . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) ( raf ) they assassinated a bunch of tier 1 celebrities of politics and economy . 
  the climax of * rafs * history is called [ german automn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_autumn ) where the attorney general of germany * siegfried buback * [ was assassinated nsfl ] ( https://youtu.be/8l7nfvxibdc?t=1m15s ) and j\u00fcrgen ponto chairman of the dresdener bank was killed , during an unsuccessful abduction attempt and later the president of the employer association , * hanns-martin schleyer * was successfully abducted ( in order to free prisoners founders and leading figures of the raf ) , in addition an allied palestine terrorist organisation abducted a german airplane , but gsg9 was able to successfully free the passengers . 
  when this hit the news , schleyer was executed and the raf prisoners killed themselves in prison . 
  the problem with that is that the base of ( the historical ) leftist parties is by a majority blue collar , which consider refugees often competitors on the labor . 
  its a predicament , they ca n't support such ideas without losing a considerable share of their base voters . 
  a base that is already in decline because of the transformation of the labor-market , that more and more becomes service dominated . 
  therefore leftist parties often tend to emphasis human rights , when they argue in order to take in refugees . 
  wait a second ... 
  i thought the us was known for its fat people and that ~ ~ orange guy . ~ ~ * tangerine-american *, 
  because if you call them out on that they usually say sorry , at least 3 times . 
  stop all this strawmanning , that really is annoying . 
  this irish fellow puts a lot of effort into explaining the situation and why it is n't that easy . 
  he even remains civil even-though you insult him . 
  progressive does n't mean that there are no problems regarding racism at all . 
  racism is deep rooted within human nature . 
  europe is no utopia or something , its a continent populated with the same species , like any other place of this planet and therefore it 's population contains racist people . 
  however europe in general values a different aspect of liberty more than the us does and therefore our political systems tend in general to at least mitigate structural racism . 
  i do n't know what you 've expected , but whatever it was these expectations were obviously to high . 
  it depends on your willingness to integrate ; but if you learn german , have a steady job and already live in germany for a while ; i ca n't see any problem with you becoming a german citizen . 
  sure , both are likely to be compatible with european values . 
  therefore integration could be easy . 
  typical movies that are shown in german schools : - [ die welle ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1063669/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) - [ christiane f ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082176/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) - [ der untergang ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) - [ das leben der anderen ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) - [ sophie scholl -- die letzten tage ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426578/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) - [ schindlers liste ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108052/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) - [ der junge im gestreiften pyjama ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914798/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) ( the boy 's name is schmuel hihi i 'm 15 and that is funny because it sounds like schwul ) - [ die wolke ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480083/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) - [ das leben ist sch\u00f6n ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118799/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) we 've watched them all , because you have to attune the students to their vacations or attune them to school when the vacations are over , haha, 
  i heard that , iran is an insider tip travel destination , because there is n't much tourism and iranians apparently are super hospitable and hungry to meet people from different cultures . 
  in cs : go there still is this low-violence option . 
  haha my mom even forbade me to play with pewter figures and toy weapons when i was a child and i really was n't the only one , not nearly . 
  also any first-person shooter [ had a long way to go before it could depict humans to be killed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkuuabnntc0 ) that imo really says a lot about modern germans relationship to the military . 
  also many us citizens hate florida , because it has the reputation for being a giant old people 's home , but for the wealthy and snobby ones . 
  or at least that is what i figured watching us-shows . 
  in europe everyone loves italy , because of its divers culture and its cuisine but also it is sunny , has huge mountains and beautiful shores . 
  i think even-though it really does n't fit 100 % i would most likely say a mixture out of california and the new england states . 
  california nature wise , new england in regards of its historical/cultural relevance , both are seen as birthplaces/cradles . 
  italy ( and especially rome ) a birthplace of european culture new england ( and especially ) boston the birthplace of the usa, 
  that is actually how i see europe as a whole , our countries get just constantly mocked at by other europeans , that we just learn to not take ourselves too seriously . 
  you can almost always exchange mockeries about stereotypes with fellow europeans or ironically mock your own country , and everyone is having a good time , whereas when i talk with americans they often do n't really get the notion of speaking self-mockingly of your own country , they do n't see the funny part and think that they have to comfort and tell you how great your country is ( sometimes even a little bit condescending , even-though i really think they have good intent ) , fellow europeans usually just laugh and join in , but then badmouth about their own countries shortcomings . 
   despite it ranking mediocre in many metrics they just do n't care about anything that contains the word metric .
