  if you are against any kind of abortion even if this imposes a huge danger on the life of the mother ( who btw is also be innocent ) , so you 're ready to risk the life of the mother to protect an innocent ( to use your term ) . 
  with the death penalty its the exact opposite you accept the possible harm of innocents for the punishment of criminals , that 's what i call hypocrisy . 
   non-religious arguments against abortion the secular arguments for a total ban of abortion are not really that convincing and that 's because when you 're arguing in a secular ethical manner you never can really be sure about any argument , because you have to concede that this topic is a very difficult one with many gray shades and many perspectives ( biologically , emancipatory , medical ethnic ) you have to consider . 
  also you have to distinguish and valuate every possible case ( rape , danger for the mother , disabilities ) . 
  that 's why there are hardly any secular ethical arguments for a total ban of abortion and because of that the majority and the most pushing elements for total abortion bans are religious groups and lobbies . 
  do n't forget about the long-lasting ottoman suppression of arabs or about the french colonial history north of the sykes -- picot line . 
  or the 8 years lasting war between iraq and iran . 
  or sadam 's second adventure in kuwait . 
  or the myriads of other factors and events that destabilized that region before that [ eloquent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be6tunbrcs8 ) american president faked pictures of wmds to legitimize an invasion, 
  why you 're try to justify this stupidity , we have right wing parties for which you can vote , as a part of our vivid democratic process in order to correct a significant development a majority of the population disagrees with ( if there actually is a majority ) , so there is no necessity to excuse or even promote vigilant justice as legitimate means to express your opinion in a working democracy . 
  actually this is a form of terrorism . 
  its not like that rt is banned or something , feel free to explore their homepage on your own . 
  but i really do n't think its necessary to promote rt further because its pushing an agenda the majority here do n't agree with and also its far from independent . 
  i agree , but i would n't say crazy . 
  exaggerating or oversimplifying suits more , like it is an exaggeration and an oversimplification to call it a sectarian war/conflict . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles wikipedia definition of this very episode of the northern-irland-conflict is `` ethno-national conflict '' . 
  but of course religion played its part in the historical prelude . 
  but the troubles was indeed no sectarian conflict . 
  nowadays there is a tendency to reduce any more complex conflict to a sectarian one . 
  i even heard people say that the arab -- israeli conflict is * nothing but * a sectarian conflict , what is totally wrong because there were/are also secular dynamics at work on both sides e.g. 
  zionism was a secular movement . 
  neither is the syrian civil war * solely * a sectarian conflict . 
  and also are the tensions between arabs and european solely of religious origins but also cultural . 
  of course religion plays a huge part and also religion has huge influence on cultural topics . 
  but also there is no such thing like ** the ** islam/moslems . 
  i 'm not aware of a single terrorist attack carried out by alevi or shiites in the western world in the last two decades . 
  ( feel free to correct me ) of course there is also shiite extremism and terrorism ( like hezbollah or the iran ) , but if you invoke the picture of a sectarian conflict between islam and `` white '' people ( i was n't aware that you have to be white to be an secular or non-muslim european are you sure you meant sectarian not racial conflict ? ), 
  you generalize in a dangerous way . 
  actually he is not a comedian , he a satirist what makes a huge difference . 
  comedy is not political at all , whereaas the very essence of satire is politics . 
  nevertheless his statement is wrong . 
   no other eu - or g20 country takes more than 20.000 refugees/year . 
  look at this statistic ( second foil ) ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/zahlen-zu-asylbewerbern-und-fluechtlingen-101.html ) 7 other countries ( excluding hungary ) took more than 20.000 refugees in 2014 . 
  also pure numbers are not really valuable , you have to see this figures in proporation to the population of the host-countries because countries have different populations and germany has the highest population in the eu . 
  what is your source ? 
  i highly doubt that italy or greece have at the moment any other choice but to take more than that number . 
  or at least shelter them for a long time . 
  the us and canada ca n't reached by refugees so they do n't have any problem what to do with millions of refugees landing on its shores . 
  that is a total different situation . 
  edit : corrected the number from 8 to 7 because of ru4reelzbroski correct objection regarding hungary . 
   i would really love to know how many migrants we sent back to turkey . 
  the last thing ** i heard ** is , that this was a miniscule amount . 
  ** i heard ** different thing . 
   merkel literally changes those policies over night , like she did with the energy policy . 
  this `` no nuclear power '' for example , was never mentioned in their party program , quiet the opposite actually . 
  same with her migration policies . 
  yes but all your examples you made were altered because of a extrem situation that occurred . 
  that 's how politics work when you are actually part of the government and have responsibility you have to adapt to the current situation . 
   this is where we actually disagree . 
  i think a german politician should relieve the pressure on germany first and the pressure on greece second , not the other way arround . 
  all of europe 's politicians safe a very few disagreed with her . 
  are none of them pragmatic ? 
  ok that is your opinion , i have another i could start with talking about responsibility but i 'm aware that i 'll probably not convince you , neither you 'll convince me , so i agree to disagree . 
   germany had already hundreds of thousands of migrants arrive this year . 
  what do you mean ? 
  compare the figures of 2015 and 2016 and look how the trend goes . 
  than you 'll understand what i meant . 
  you are confusing things . 
  merkels `` open border approach '' as you call it , was never a policy but a short-term reaction to relieve the pressure on southern european countries like greece . 
  ( that what i call very pragmatic ) also do n't talk about it like it is still a ongoing thing , because the situation already altered a lot , and also immigration receded . 
  there is the turkey deal e.g. 
  which reduces the pressure , but such deals needed time to be negotiated . 
  its not like that the cdu approach on refugee politics in general is let every one in and do nothing about the causes of flight . 
  maybe you should read the election program of the cdu . 
  the vast majority of the current refugees are not economic refugees but refugees of war , so this approach ca n't effect the refugee influx neither in the short-run nor in the long-run . 
  i have to admit that its a good approach to target the causes of flight , but sadly it really lacks a pragmatic perspective and therefore its just superficial and far from an worked-out approach . 
  the only thing the afd is doing at the moment is criticizing current policies , without presenting any doable alternatives , which are in accordance with the human rights . 
  so even their immigration policy is far from `` worked-out '' . 
  but the csu ( already one of the ruling parties ) has similar positions on immigration policies like the afd and is pressuring the other parties constantly into more strict policies . 
  its not like that the afd is the only possible option . 
  also the the afd ( even if any established party wants to coalise with it , what is very unlikely ) has to make compromises in order to form a coalition . 
  the bnd report never claimed that turkey supported isis , but other jihadist terrorist groups . 
  just google it . 
  turkey supported al-nusra which is more or less a ally of isis and al qaeda . 
  of course there is weapon smuggling but this weapons do n't must necessarily go to isis . 
  so there is no proof  isis fighters could pass the turkish/syrian border in masses without someone stopping them . 
  or isis selling oil over the tukish/syrian border ... and so on . 
  this is no active direct support ( look at what i wrote , i explicitly wrote `` direct '' by what i meant distribution of military training or weapons ) but merely acquiescence ( what is more or less a form of support , but no direct support ) what makes a difference . 
  actually at the moment there is no proof turkey supported isis in anyway directly , that is a fact of course you can assume that turkey supported isis ( which is imo also not inconceivable ) but that is just an assumption based on subjective biases and therefore your opinion as it is my subjective opinion that i do n't think turkey directly supported isis . 
  of course i made a simplification , but many of the examples you made are nowadays part of the democratic process and regulated and even guarantied through law . 
  in germany labor strikes are legal under certain conditions and considered a totally acceptable means to pressure employers in wage negotiations . 
  boycotts are also not illegal . 
  the right to demonstrate is a fundamental right , so demonstrations are a part of democracy , too . 
  challenging laws in constitutionals courts are as well a part of the democratic process , because of the necessity to protect the constitution and therefore ensure the survival of democracy . 
  something must not have the approval of a majority to be democratic . 
  democracy refers also to certain values , which include in modern times minority rights or gender - or sexual - equality . 
  but what is certainly not a democratic value is to harm the rights of other people e.g. 
  by destroying their property or even possible endanger their lives . 
   at the very least , consider realpolitik . 
  will ignoring people who do n't play by your rules make them go away ? 
  of course not , but we do n't ignore them . 
  they get prosecuted and convicted , if they committed crimes and if not they can seek to find legit means to make their voices heard and participate in the democratic process . 
  ( actually this is what they are doing , look at the afd , i really dislike the afd but even i have to acknowledge that its a product of democracy and therefore a legit means to make their voices heard , whereas burning refugee-shelters or politicians cars is not ), 
  thank you i appreciate it . 
  both sides seek shelter into the role of the victim . 
  a democracy ca n't afford to regard undemocratic actions as a legitimate way to express one 's opinion , regardless of the culprits political stance . 
  i do n't think that turkey ever supported isis directly . 
  probably turkey did n't put as much effort into the crackdown of is oil smuggling as it possibly could , but you also have to be aware that the most share of isis oil was bought by the assad regime . 
  the syrian civil war is a complex and obscure conflict including some proxy wars . 
  there is no black and white but cynicism and opportunism of all players remotely involved in it .
