  ok then mr. strawman . 
  yes i agree indeed this whole thing is pretty narcissistic imo . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agency_114  proposed a coordinated action to move the blame away from the german war criminals under various investigations . 
  benzinger adopted a deceitful term `` polish concentration camps '' in reference to the holocaust in occupied poland and propagated it in popular media . 
  [ nazi germany ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/iii_rzesza ) [ germany ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/niemcy ), 
   yes i 'm right also emphasized that bacca was on a mission to prove that muslims were peaceful . 
  but in her description of the `` brides on tour '' project , bacca and her traveling partner silvia moro made no mention of muslims . 
  instead , morro described their project in an interview as simply a way to promote peace in a general sense : http://www.snopes.com/bacca-brides-on-tour/ nice that this story fits your narrative but its not factual . 
  yes because the term `` nazi '' is totally disconnected from the term `` germany '' only sherlock holmes could deduce that when someone speaks about nazis he means nazi germany . 
  that is probably true west german denazification was a joke . 
  just take a look at facebook and get disappointed about your view . 
  it scared me how many of my friends fell for the pizzagate hoax , ofc censorship is not the solution but its obvious that escalating conspiracy theories have a huge potential to destabilize our societies especially when they are consciously spread by big players with huge resources who have an vital interest to destabilize their geopolitical adversaries . 
  it really is a predicament of modern democracies but ofc state owned ministries are no real counter and sadly they have surely the potential to even promote certain narratives which will help e.g. 
  russia to spread their misinformation . 
  yes it is . 
  but he said let germany be and give bavaria to austria i just wanted to make sure that that excludes franconia . 
  but we franconians are no bavarians we even speak normal understandable german . 
  we do n't want to live in the tyranny of the lederhosen , etztala reichts . 
  did just made a mom-joke ? 
  the term is used very frequently just take a random history book about the 3rd reich i ensure you that in every fucking one of them you 'll find this term , a whole episode of the french revolution is called the reign of terror . 
  its just important to discuss the term imo und to be aware of its political implications , if you do n't want to it is fine , but no need to interdict other people from pointing out some facts . 
   i just do n't see the point in complicating things just to sound more intelligent or w/e . 
  yeah but you are just oversimplifying things . 
  this has nothing to do with being more intelligent just read the introduction of wikipedia regarding this topic , that 's just the basics about terrorism . 
  the term is ambiguous that just a fact i do n't care if it fits your world view or not or if you are even overwhelmed by that . 
  if you want to use this term in a simple way you can but than you should n't be surprised when people pointing out that your statements are factual wrong especially when they concern the history of peoples countries , which you seem not to grasp fully . 
  ofc the initial statement imbob23 was bullshit and exaggerating . 
  nevertheless the 3rd reich was a terror state , which used terrorism as a political means . 
  terrorism is just an ambiguous term and is a phenomena which wears many heads . 
   everything can be considered terrorism if you want to go down that road . 
  ofc the problem is that the term can be used politically to stigmatize opponents and to stamp their deeds as illegitimate and than it depends on perspectives what terrorism is and what is not . 
  but you acting like that there is a universal definition of terrorism , but actually there is not , the term is very controversial , but to reduce the whole phenomena to the most extrem and clear manifestations like daesh ignores a by far more complex reality . 
  state terrorism is a established political term , which is for example applied to deeds of the 3rd reich , that is just a reality , if you do n't like that than its your problem not mine . 
  thx , i definitely will try it , 
  [ state terrorism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_terrorism )  refers to acts of terrorism conducted by a state against [ foreign targets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_gladio ) or against its own people . 
  ofc there is a difference but terrorism was and potentially still is a political means that states can possibly use or used in the past , that why the terrorist research also looking into this form of terrorism . 
  i would have said beer , but if you prefer sauerkraut , sauerkraut it is :d [ yummy polish vodka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bbubr%c3%b3wka ), 
  would always prefer you over the other guy to party with , 
  you probably meant that only 0,1 % of all asylum seekers commit murders and homicides and not that only 0,1 % of all murders are committed by asylum seekers . 
  because otherwise this is wrong :  they are not more or less violent as germans themselves . 
  because 0,1 % of all murders would mean that they were a lot less violent than germans and even underrepresented . 
  imo at least no shitty new age bullshit should be allowed to claim e.g. 
  that it can cure cancer without any other actual medical therapy . 
   that does n't mean * every * man is a killer actually it means that **   99 % ** of men are no killers . 
   but is very much more likely for a man to kill a woman . 
  that is true , but nevertheless the general likelihood to be a victim of such a crime is ridiculously low , regardless of gender we are talking about 1,7 cases/100 .000 inhabitants per year in finland . 
  ( 0,0017 % of its total population ) so this :  why three women ? 
  men are afraid that women will laugh at them . 
  women are afraid that men will kill them . 
  is total bs . 
  because it was a generalizing comment . 
  i do n't take this personally , i even acknowledge what you said , just reread my comments . 
   downplaying this subject and dictating and shaming how women should feel . 
  come on . 
  finally you name the actual topic , which is not about murder statistics but modern gendertopics , now we can actually talk . 
  maybe in a factual way ? 
   when the other person is 20-40 kgs heavier than you and significantly stronger , it is completely normal to be acknowledge the risk with someone you know can snap you like toothpick yes that 's how it is but statistic shows that this risk is relatively low , i do n't dispute your point , i just think murder is n't that of a problem in our societies in europe , whereas other crimes like domestic abuse and rape against women still is , because risk of a women getting killed is ** < < < 1 % ** whereas rape and domestic abuse against women have prevalences which are actually significant and therefore reasonable for women to have fears about ( and i do n't want to tell them how they should feel !, 
  if they feel endangered they can but statistics just say something totally different , so please can you acknowledge that ? 
  ) , even-though imo the term rape culture is incorrect , the numbers of rapes are still too high . 
   however yes it was irrelevant to the discussion , especially in this particular case since the risk for a man to be killed by strange man is much higher than for women . 
  thank you . 
  ofc you can do that , i just explained you why you got downvoted , because you wondered . 
  also the whole foundation of the * `` discussion '' * was fruitless from the start . 
  because this :  why three women ? 
  men are afraid that women will laugh at them . 
  women are afraid that men will kill them . 
  is bs, 
   edit : i find the downvotes interesting.apparently facts are not welcomed if they are not nice enough , so let 's prefere the fake one because feelings . 
  its not the question if these facts are true or not , bigblueferrets comments were very exaggerated and provoking therefor everybody because feeling falsely accused automatically acts more sensitive , you ca n't expect an open debate to evolve when the very outset of the debate is provocation . 
  for me its actually a nobrainer that men are in the average more inclined to physical violence , and probably nobody here dispute that because its just logical in regards of biology . 
  do n't act like this is neutral ground , because the initial comment was n't just pointing some facts out , but outright sexism . 
  also the numbers of manslaughter and murder are declining in most european countries and these case are rare in comparison to other criminality and in relation to the overall population , which are btw also facts you forgot to mention . 
  nevertheless murders are very rare and not something that happens often if you imply that it happens often and give an indication that every women should live in fear about getting killed by men than you clearly should get a shrink . 
  ok that is true and i can acknowledge that , nevertheless fear and felt security is subjective and statistic says something different , also i remember you about the post i responded to :  men killing women almost never happens , it 's always female snipers killing men . 
  the person meant that sarcastic , but actually the first part is true at least in europe . 
  your examples also do n't exclusively apply to women . 
  men often get molested by morons who just want to start a fight . 
  regardless of your gender you 're always endangered to become a victim of violence ( men even more than women ) and its also true that physical violence is more often used by men , nevertheless these aggressive impulses in men which are responsible for that are also the reason why men chose more often than women to become policemen or soldiers and therefor do something very important for the society and even secure people from violence , so it goes both ways . 
  murder in general is not something that is very common , so its not true that women have to fear to get murdered that 's total bs . 
  if you hate men get yourself a shrink . 
  i watched the first tv-duel without any moderation between hofer and van der bellen it was the most hilarious cringe i ever got out of politics . 
  it already has , if isis loses its syrian and iraqi territories it will not disappear into thin air , there are already [ many terrorist groups/rebels which see themselves as affiliates of isis ] ( http://understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/isis%20regional%20map%20may%20high%20res%202016-01_5.png ) if syrian fight become useless for isis , they will probably redistribute their jihadist efforts to other stages in the region , many think tanks emphasized the resilience of isis , but ofc if its loses its territories in iraq and syria it will have a significant loss of income . 
  the problem about the term selfish is that it automatically implies that an action has an altruistic alternative which is also the better/more morale to choose and that not the case here . 
  but ofc we 're discussing about subtiles and if you want to see it this way i have no problem with that even-though i disagree , discusses about one single word are just exaggeration . 
  your arguments are sensible i respect that . 
  that is really how this debate should take place , not about ideology but an ethical perspective . 
   this is how one could justify the killing of all kinds of humans . 
  those in a coma do n't have consciousness either . 
  there 's all kinds of congenital defects that cripple the cognitive development and faculties of a human from birth . 
  but when it comes to the fetuses in abortion cases , they almost always could have developed to their full potential as an adult human . 
  the difference is that fetus are potential life without contentiousness , whereas people in coma are actual living persons who already effected their environment with their distinct observable inner and/or outer features and therefore the emotional connection is different . 
  there are just abstract ways to experience a fetus in its early development and that is why there is no inconsistency just a logical one , but human morals are based on emotions and sentiments , that is why humans tend to value the direct experiencable over the potential . 
   i think there are logically consistent viewpoints for many combinations of these views , personally . 
  consistence is certainly something worth to aim for , but its hard if not impossible to be consistent when two different ( or even more ) topics meet in one phenomenon which is the case when it comes to abortion . 
  however the second dimension of abortion is the effect on the mothers life . 
  something you just fob off because of your focus on life and you conviction that life is life regardless of its consciousness its state of development or tangibility , actually that is the very questions about the ethics of abortion , when does human life start ? 
  what to value more and how to evaluate a fetus in comparison to the influence on the mothers life . 
  and your arguments are just a more sophisticated repetitions/alterations of the same tune and so are mine . 
  you choose the life aspect over the emancipatory aspect and i choose vice versa . 
  the emancipatory dimension manifest chiefly in the negative consequences of the pregnancy and motherhood which are myriad and have a huge potential to disadvantage women over men and even effect them regardless if they decide to give the child up for adoption or not .
