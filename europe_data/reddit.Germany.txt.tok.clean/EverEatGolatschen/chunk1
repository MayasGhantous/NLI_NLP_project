i once got my brand new pumas stolen when i left them in front of the apartment . 
  i still suspect the movers of the household above us found them shiny . 
  my world view was shattered that day . 
  who , with a job , steals shoes !, 
   sounds like all germans on holiday . 
  nothing wrong with weather appropriate clothing ... 
  you forgot young women talking . 
  i could listen to that all day . 
  as germans do rent significantly more than buy and own , there is only a light rise in ownage-prices ( not a bubble ) . 
  in ( high density ) cities rents are dramatically rising . 
  new build apartment buildings are only build for wealthy and former low-profit co-op build apartment buildings are bought out by high - profit companies , rents will rise predicted by 5 % this year , not good . 
  additionally few new apartments are build , so in cities the wait-lists are tight . 
  booklett du fromage !, 
   what 's childbirth like in your country ? 
  quite rare . 
  raise funds/tax-money for a massive agressive `` speak german on germanys streets '' publicity campaign . 
  i know i am not being asked , but here is my second one : reorganize and concentrate funds in the public boradcasting . 
  3 found prizes ( and medals ) for civil engineer and architect of the year . 
  4 stock up the damn military expenses , this includes a giant payraise in the sector . 
  5 cut down `` herdpr\u00e4mie '', 
   `` it 's as though the turks were coming . '', 
  funny , german has `` die russen sind da/die russen kommen '' ( the russians are here/are comeing ) for giving up on a commotional sutiation . 
  its not used often tho , popularized by werner comics . 
  check the username , people speak like that in the future . 
  you put it as anon ever had true goals . . there are no goals , that is not how an ad-hoc society works . 
  they are collecting told-you-so karma , as does the ccc and the pirates . 
  actually . . not so much , remember , we fight the dutch , no the english . 
  already ( phonetically ) taken as nickname for euro-currency in germany , euronen ( rhymes with dublonen - doubloons ), 
  if then it must be gro\u00dfdiutishes reich . 
  diutishes as a cacography of the approximated '' [ diutisc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theodiscus ) '' as in `` we people '' . 
  that way it would be technically not even german . 
  i like that idea . 
  it is also the next best thing after an [ eraser ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eraser#history ) . 
  i may be a sudet , but i still can not eat that damn stuff without thinking of paper mach\u00e9 . 
  while understandable that this article is russia-centric , half of this reasons could be also said about why it is a bad idea to randomly smile in public in scandinavia + poland + germany . 
  russia is culturally not that far away from europe . 
  of course not , because you know , it is the same procedure as every year . 
  ohh i like that comparison !, 
  i do not know where the hack writer ~ ~ got ~ ~ the `` information '' he is thumbing on got from . 
  i could not find anything on the handelsblatt website that was even remotely trumpeting in that direction . 
  fact is , that we `` lost '' one president ( k\u00f6hler ) over the fact that he [ dared to share the thought ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrhljufmlvg ) of `` secureing trade routes in afghanistan '' . 
  i know i am late for the party , but it did not die . 
  we just use it as a real insult , i guess nobody wanted to start a fight . 
  sorry , strong oven phobia ... 
  have you ever tried getting a fishing license ? 
  i dont konw about sh , but down here it 's at least twice as hard as getting a drivers license . 
  got ta learn all the `` what is allowed to fish when '' nature conservation crap . 
  naw . . - every week the pegida goes on a `` walk '' . 
  must have been them . 
  we have those signs in n\u00fcrnberg . 
  people either ignore it or ca n't read . 
  i chose to assume the latter . 
  somethig something makeing a nationalist party socialist something, 
  to charlemagne : make sure your succesor is actually strong enough to hold the title . 
  in doubt kill one of his sons . 
  better yet make sure one of yours survives you . 
  and stop fasting you idiot !, 
  what about the smoking habit ? 
  [ eh ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skat_%28card_game%29 ), 
  if you 'd like to do some invasion . . i allow it !, 
  just a tip from one that was removed from the equation : becherowka  slibovitz, 
  last time i counted . . um . . forced gay monarchy ? 
  . . fundies will fume !, 
  anecdote time !, 
  i was walking the park at evening/night ( do n't judge neckbeard has a day job yo ) when two shaved heads and a brown-blonde approched me - `` are you german ? '', 
  - to which i burst in laughter , you see im a sudet , my granny didnt walk 400 km for nothing . 
  two days later the kebap ~ ~ guy ~ ~ restaurateur in the district next to the park was shot in the head . 
  this was before the nsu was caught , so i 'd like to think i techncially laughed at death . 
  ah yes , ze exportcunts . . sorry about that . 
  ( a german cab driver would need a long explanation why he should wait a whole 10 minutes btw . ), 
  this depends very much on the chances on the job market of that person . 
  i 'd say working two ( low qualification ) jobs is gladly not the norm ( yet ) but i do know 2-3 people who did this , either for a short while or still onoging . 
  what is more common , due to taxation effects and bad salary , is a so called `` aufstocker '' where your salary is just below the minimum of what welfare would give you if you did not work . 
  those people are subsidized so they have just about the same income as if they would not work . 
  they usually work 8 + hour days so a second job is not exactly workable ( pardon the pun ) . 
  we got whole ( 2 hour ) documentaries about them . 
  very much romanticized if you ask me , but then , i am not that good with this whole `` outside '' concept . 
  as a third generation sudet , i am amazed some even care still . 
  seriously , let it be , the whole point has been moot since the late 70s . 
  disclaimer : my parents met in on of the sub-clubs of the organization , which kinda makes me a very young '' * throughbred * '' , but i myself have never been to any event of this matter . 
  some argue it dropped after schmidt . 
  which is exactly what brought up the situation in the first place . 
  iranian descend , that is a difference , he explicitly referred to himself as german , in german no less . 
  depends , bavaria incorporates 5 tribes . 
  austro-bavarian : - ln / - erl ( upper and lower , i dont remember which is which ) swabian : - le fraconian - la / - li / - le ( - le being rare ) upper pallatinate : - louw, 
  not op but yes and yes and yes-no . 
  it is a federal and cultural issue . 
  politics and sopciety were no interested in the topic , and then it was too late . 
  now all we can do it slowly work on it . 
  yes , of course , but then , why take the most imperialistic language ? 
  why not , let 's say ... dutch . . it is just as much influenced by all the other languages , is from the main land , and has within europe no bad history . 
  hell if it where for the mixture , why not dig up good old esperanto !, 
  sooo , instead of `` make everybody speak english '' you mean `` make everybody be able to speak english '' . 
  i would be very glad if my mother tongue survived . 
  my reason for my scepticism is that haveing a lingua franca is always a sign of dominance . 
  ( i see this thread goodwinning every moment ), 
  excuse me , why english ? 
  well , i see your point . 
  well my grandfathers last name is my last name , so i am not really brave enough to mention it on the internet . 
  i may show on the word `` art '' what happend : this : um\u011bn\u00ed went this : umeni you have to understand the sudets di n't really like the czech at that point in time .
