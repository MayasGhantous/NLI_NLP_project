  austria , switzerland , lichtenstein , belgium , luxembourg , netherlands , czech republic . 
  make the holy roman empire great again and make it german again . 
  no popes and lombards and tuscans and especially no venetians . 
  i 'm from the south , i 'm not qualified to comment on danes . 
  all i can say from when i was in the north is that you got delicious hot dogs . 
  do n't worry bohemia , you 're cool, 
  you are fake news , teutonic order stronk, 
  the french ca n't drive . 
  i live close to the border and when the french have a holiday and come shopping i have to fear for my life when crossing a street . 
  the austrians do n't seem to consider us as much of a cultural brother as i think would be historically reasonable , and that hurts my soft heart . 
  the dutch language was a mistake . 
  just maybe decide whether you want to speak english , french or german and do n't attempt to speak all three at once while piss drunk the polish have that weird name for danzig . 
  i 'm a firm believer that it is the destiny of mankind to forever strive to better themselves and the world around them through whatever means . 
  genetic manipulation in order to `` fix flaws '' , reduce frequence of disabilities and such is all fine in my eyes , but if genetic modification becomes an accepted thing , then we will face issues such as the one you 've mentioned , but also philosophical issues such as what can you consider a flaw , or what is actually considered `` better '' . 
  archaic , scary and very dangerous . 
   brazil ( though we showed our superiority a few years ago ) that was n't `` a few years '' ago , that was last summer and it will forever be last summer !, 
  nothing beats [ the remoulade post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/5otpio/kannst_du_mich_hilfen_bitte/ ), 
  and then the winged pl-01s arrived, 
   if there were a worthwhile / r/askgermany sub , i 'd ask there r/germany is a good place to ask , although it 's mostly frequented by expats and foreigners living in germany . 
  you can make a post in english on r/de to get a broader audience , 99 % of germans there can speak english very well and i think everyone will be okay with that . 
  i could ask my parents , but we live so far in the south that the reunification did n't really impact them all that much . 
  fite me , i 'll throw all our hookers at you !, 
  they are little more than anectdotes . 
  with so much talk about nazi germany and the 20th century in general , there 's little room in history department of the average german 's brain to dedicate serious thoughts toward the old ruling dynasties . 
  sometimes you maybe get a `` old hohenzollern died '' in a newspaper , that 's about it . 
  ah , nothing makes you feel quite as german as being accused of still being a nazi . 
  gib back prussia, 
  i like to look at it to make me feel better about ours . 
  it 's a joke to me . 
  when i see gofundme posts on the internet of people trying to gather money to be able to get ** life saving surgery ** , all i can do is scoff , for my own sanity . 
  how anyone can be fine with this system is beyond me . 
  the origin of our bundesl\u00e4nder in the ** federal ** republic of germany goes as far back as the germanic tribes inhabiting this region over 2000 years ago . 
  individual tribes hardly in contact with each other , creating their own unique culture and dialect . 
  the holy roman empire was not able to centralise and unify these individual peoples , and it took a lot of work to get them together even in the german empire . 
  the 16 bundesl\u00e4nder of germany are roughly what is left of that , and although they do n't exactly reflect the culture and language groups inside germany , the cultural differences between the states are quite apparent , that 's why a federal republic was the only way to go . 
  americans have a reputation for a lot of things over here , being stoners is not one of them . 
  if we look at it from a more tangible and less scientific perspective , you could say that the feeling of `` us '' among germans goes as far back as the founding of the holy roman empire . 
  from that point on the peoples inhabiting germanic regions did start working together and see themselves as part of a larger entity . 
  however the holy roman empire did include northern italians and and bohemia . 
  the 1512 diet of cologne is really as far as i would go , where the holy roman empire became the holy roman empire of german nation , so the focus on germanic peoples was made clear then . 
  still , the modern feeling of `` us '' is very new , historically speaking . 
  before the rise of nationalism , `` us '' was concerning your family , your village , the people inhabiting this specific region speaking your dialect . 
  it did n't go far beyond that . 
  the wartburg fest of 1817 is probably the earliest point you could refer to as the emergence of a feeling of national identity among the german states . 
  there were many minor advances toward a sense of unity among the dozens of german cultures before , particularly in the language and literature department ( martin luther laid the foundation for a universally understood dialect , which is an important step ) , but the wartburg fest , all the other vorm\u00e4rz events , the m\u00e4rzrevolution itself and the unification of 1871 are the major steps to look at when discussing german national identity . 
  i do n't think of the nazi era as a blank space in the development of the german national identity . 
  it was the collective fault of the german people of that time that allowed this to happen , and it is the collective duty of any past generation to never let it happen again . 
  do n't care much for the current one . 
  historically very interesting of course , and it 's a nice little anecdote to tell that their royal house is a german one . 
  the house of saxe-coburg und gotha , changed to windsor in the light of anti-german sentiment during ww1 . 
   `` wirrachaftswunder '' did you purposefully write that wrong because of some inside joke ? 
  bismarck - the iron chancellor ( der eiserne kanzler ) frederik the great - the old fritz ( der alte fritz ) , friderikus rex friedrich i. 
  - barbarossa friedrich wilhelm i. of prussia - the soldier king ( der soldatenk\u00f6nig ) ludwig ii . 
  of bavaria - the fairytale king ( der m\u00e4rchenk\u00f6nig ), 
  bismarck is the only man in the world that matters . 
  lots of politics around here now revolve around `` what 's the best way to deal with all the shit trump does and could do '' . 
  it 's so long ago that i started learning english . 
  the only thing i remember is logging into an english runescape world and not understanding anything . 
  am i dumb ? 
  ask me that . 
  i 'll say yes , i totally read iceland . 
  geez , i 'm so sorry . 
  ~ ~ well , iceland was settled by norwegians , and norwegians are germanic , so i 'd go with yes . ~ ~, 
   airheaded now that 's an adjective i ca n't quite imagine anything by . 
  care to explain it a bit ? 
  just shout `` skanderberg '' and they 'll fall on their knees . 
  damn dutch clogging up our highways with their damn caravans !, 
  science is not the opposite of religion . 
  in a more political sense we have [ germania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/f_a_von_kaulbach_germania_1914.jpg ) , and the spirit of the german people is usually personified as [ the michel ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/michel_und_seine_kappe_im_jahre_48.jpg ), 
  to me it 's an accurate representation of how americans probably view wwii . 
  then again it 's a tarantino movie which is supposed to be cheesy as hell , not my cup of tea . 
  what is it good for ? 
  i do n't think any german quite understands what the fuck is going on with that berlin airport . 
  so what is a `` normal '' and `` adult '' hobby to spend money on in your opinion ? 
  americans have been the joke of the world long before trump got elected president . 
  that was just the cherry on top of a big cake of embarrasment . 
  i think it 's glorified to a dangerous degree by the populace . 
  that 's about it . 
  they 're soldiers , they do the killing when their generals tell them to , ca n't fault them specifically for all the shit the us has pulled . 
  i know that one . 
  too many pfalz 's in this country . 
  wait what . 
   kurpfalz so , since we have no holy roman empire anymore , you mean pfalz ? 
  that 'll definitely get you stares . 
  what is this , why have i never heard of it and why am i not there right now this looks amazing, 
  saarland , never seen a single school with a flag or even a flag pole . 
  does breitbart count ? 
  not that i know of . 
  we do differentiate between the generations by historical context . 
  old people were the ones who were children during later years of the war and got to see post-war germany . 
  our parents got to witness the fall of the wall and the ddr ( though i live so far south that i do n't have any relatives that actually lived inside ) . 
  hey that 's a nice joke . 
  there was only the habsburgs . 
  not trying to start an argument , just giving you a heads-up to avoid looking silly toward europeans in the future . 
  excuse the bitterness , it comes from spending too much time on an american website mostly used by americans , and the things some of your countrymen say on here can be truly infuriating if you care too much . 
  you just have to realise how silly it sounds when a 300 year old country talks about `` intense regional diversity '' . 
  some americans truly and unironically believe it 's comparable to the rest of the world . 
  ah yes the famed american diversity . 
  well take that times ten and you have european cultural diversity , coming from more than 2000 years of individual history . 
  yeah but you 'd need to know next to nothing about european history to think that 's how it worked .
