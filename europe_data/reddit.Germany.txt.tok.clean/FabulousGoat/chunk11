  you do learn at least a little bit about europe in school , i hope ? 
  y' all need a grammar reform . 
  having to learn which letters not to pronounce is a complete waste of time . 
  you just hit me with the nostalgia cannon . 
   based on all these comments it seems i was mistaken as seeing europe as a single culture . 
  out of curiosity , what made you think there is such a thing ? 
  whether or not the npd should be banned . 
  the nature mostly . 
  translation : `` i believe in the horse . 
  the car is a passing phenomenon '' . 
  bring back the kalmar union, 
  you can always just shout `` the patriarchy '' for an easy trigger . 
  everyone 's a lad on the internet , lass . 
  replied to the wrong comment lad . 
  those who could understand what you 're saying would give you a weird glance and ignore you . 
  the rest would give you a weird glance for mumbling to yourself in a foreign language . 
  great metal bands . 
  what even is the dutch language . 
  the historical ties between austria and hungary were mostly political , less so cultural . 
  sizeable communities of ethnic germans lived in slavic territories like bohemia , hungary , the balkan , poland and the baltic as a result of the ostsiedlung . 
  most of them were either driven into germany , expelled or killed by the soviet union and the emerging balkan states at the end of wwii , which was the ending point of the loose cultural ties with slavic states . 
  the austro hungarian empire was a political union , the state of hungary was its own thing , with its own laws , army etc. 
  as reforms never came to pass and nationalism was bountiful , the union was undone rather easily . 
  nowadays the historical ties between slavs and germans are barely noticable . 
  please tell me you were being sarcastic . 
  if everyone had guns the way they do in america , maybe . 
  but not on the same level . 
  to become a police officer in germany you need to go to police school for 3 years . 
  they 'll evaluate if you have the right mental state for the job . 
   do the former west german states have more in common with austria than the former gdr states ? 
  the gdr border was pretty arbitrary in a historical and cultural sense , just wanted to point that out . 
  it 's better to compare north germans ( protestant ) with south germans ( catholic ) , the divide known as the wei\u00dfwurst\u00e4quator , if you want to see who has more in common with austria . 
  am saarl\u00e4nder , can confirm buisness is booming . 
  there are certain places in larger cities where you might get stupid looks and calls and be made uncomfortable , but those are a part of big cities and have nothing to do with muslim refugees . 
  if you 're talking about american style ghettos where you can get shot just for taking a wrong turn , then no , we do n't have anything like that . 
  merkel . 
  outside of politics probably rammstein . 
  ottoman stronk , protect weak women from danger , like education and work . 
  from the unification 1871 until world war i , i 'd say . 
  we 'd have to greatly invest into education and fund universities much more for germany to become a land of scientists and nobel price winners again . 
  * overthrown, 
   fell behind in 17-18th 17th century we fell behind because of the thirty-years war , but the 18th century was a century of prussian rise to power under frederik the great , would n't say we fell behind there, 
  yeah i was n't agreeing with that either . 
  from what i 've learned about japan i always thought of them as asian germany . 
  explain, 
  is n't that what other people think of us , though ? 
   hey , you , we just got started , you ca n't end this now . 
  maybe means it marked the start of a century of religious tension culminating in the thirty-years war . 
   you 've paid your dues , you 're free , of what are you afraid ? 
  probably refers to the `` ablassbriefe '' . 
  you could buy them from the church and they would free you of your sins . 
   taking on responsibility knowing it will weigh you down freedom is a possibility only if you 're able to say no might refer to those who stood with catholicism despite the reformation , in order to save lives in the conflict ahead . 
   people in northern europe since medieval times , we find it hard to deal with when our dreams come true could just mean that northern europe was n't as fortunate as the lands surrounding the mediterranean . 
  it was colder , food was n't as plentiful . 
  if you 're in london , the imperial war museum is a must . 
  great ww1 exposition they have there . 
  cdu csu are conservatives , they are n't nazis . 
  the afd are nazis . 
  no one would make a coalition with the nazis . 
  awww , alrighty then , does n't hurt to try . 
   fucking prussian side thinking they are better poland . 
  if you do n't want it ... you could always give it back ... 
  the prettiest cities are the ones where old architecture prevails . 
  that 's why paris is gorgeous , and i find cities like new york hideous . 
  until architectural trends embrace some style again and we go full futuristic , i 'd like to stick to the roots . 
  i have a really hard time understanding what this is about . 
  `` esoteric pseudo science '' i 'm gon na use that during dinner with the family next time . 
  my mother is one of those people who read things like `` pendeln f\u00fcr anf\u00e4nger '' and she 's gon na hate that , it 's gon na be great . 
  words to live by . 
  that 's not a union , that 's a reich . 
  you mean just as good ? 
  was ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yugirh7eq7w#t=57s ), 
  it 's the writing . 
  many translators for video games focus on a translation that makes sense grammatically and disregard whether it sounds good/natural . 
  a good adaptation into german is worth its weight in gold . 
  to this day i prefer the german version of lord of the rings over the english original . 
  but you 're flipping a coin ? 
  so if you say `` munt '' you always win ? 
  i wear nothing , i walk barefoot . 
  socks are oppression . 
  i do n't even wear socks indoors . 
  mondschanze . 
  we 'll use it as a forward outpost to drive the remnants of the nazis from the dark side of the moon . 
  back in the 18th and 19th century it was the hip new shit , the most progressive minds were nationalist , it was the ideology of professors , students , the academical elite of a country . 
  then imperalism and two world wars happened , justified by nationalism , where those professors and students went and died , and we learned that much like communism , it can be turned into a tool of extremists much too quickly . 
  in the europe of today that needs to keep so many different nations and cultures together , nationalism is not a good thing . 
  right now . 
  should work now . 
  well , he had plenty of occasions to come out of his mountain then .

  the `` border '' to france is 2km away from my house , you walk through the woods past a sign that says `` welcome to france '' , then you 're in a little town where most of us buy our baguettes . 
  i wonder how old people feel about that . 
  well the `` but whatever '' part made me think you were taking me seriously . 
  english and german . 
  i was mocking the attitude of the russian empire before ww1 . 
  russia : defender of slavs . 
  yes , they did . 
  personal liberty , rationalism and secularism all sprout the modern views about lgbt , women 's rights and racial equality .
