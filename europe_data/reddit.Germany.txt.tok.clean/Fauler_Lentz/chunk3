  just take a look at a map of london and become envious of the highly efficient road system , more than sufficient above-ground parking space , and complete lack of narrow one-way streets . 
   the ukraine has always pretty much been a part of russia haha , ja genau !, 
  the sk propaganda machine loves churning out bullshit , not just about north koreans . 
  their news stations are about as trustworthy as russia 's . 
  a fan on a vertical axis would still be a fan though . 
  a radial fan . 
  oh , interesting . 
  thanks !, 
  til i would have thought bavarians simply ca n't stand being beaten by north germans in anything . 
  the [ border between czech republic and germany ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/germany/@50.6645372,13.5440242,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x479a721ec2b1be6b:0x75e85d6b8e91e55b!5m1!1e4 ) is a natural border , along a low mountain range . 
  what 's a fan-free wind turbine ? 
  this map does n't say much about the altitude of those winds though . 
   it 's navy only needs battleships . 
  you mean combat ships . 
  a battleship is a specific class of ship , which is no longer used by anybody . 
  rocket fuel can be lit by fire , and potentially explode if it gets too hot . 
  same thing with propellant of artillery shells . 
  it would also have the added benefit of giving them a chance to self-destruct when they are doing actual politics . 
  depends on the definition , but usually it comes down to the distinction of `` patriotism '' vs. `` nationalism '' : the latter strongly implies putting the interest of ones own interest above all else . 
  it therefore has a very negative connotation to it . 
  the conservatives ( tories ) feared losing seats to ukip populists , so they put a referendum about leaving the eu up on the agenda . 
  apparently it worked . 
  [ that 's ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/mg_08-15.jpg/1920px-mg_08-15.jpg ) how a 100 years old machinegun looks . 
  since when does every person drinking alcohol have an alcohol problem ? 
  what difference is there between drinking a glass of wine or apple juice in the evening ? 
  why should one be forced to label its nutrition data , and the other does not ? 
  either everything should be forced to label , or nothing . 
  exceptions like that are inconsistent , and they are very impractical for people trying to control their diet . 
  yes , the spd destroying itself beyond recovery certainly was n't a good thing for germany as a whole . 
  and now they leave the job of leading the opposition to ideological and populist nutjobs . 
  dibs on the bandname, 
  but that information in particular is useless without context . 
  what use is knowing the capital of serbia , if you do n't know what serbia is , and why it exists ? 
  i had to be able to point out the european nations and their capitals on a blank map , but until quite recently i knew nothing about most of europe . 
  useless information if you ask me . 
  nuclear fusion reactors do n't exist yet though . 
  it was my intention to be cruel to any fellow german native, 
  i 'll support you in your mission to make german more ordentlich . 
  half the things we say are completely unnecessary . 
  you can order some cucumber water, 
  they started modernizing around the early 2000s or so , i still remember the restaurants looking uncomfortable and cheap before . 
  stocks more then doubled since then . 
  pretty much . 
  farmers with property in the right area are making loads of money selling property . 
  further away from large cities villages are declining though , particularly in the east . 
   the mcs providing stealth capability in the visual , near-infrared , thermal infrared and broadband radar wavebands , dimming sensors , obscures targeting and fooling smart ammunition and giving a tactical and operational advantage . 
  [ ... ] the mcs with integrated heat reduction system ( coolcam ) effectively reduces heat build-up from solar loading and environmental heat while operating in hot climate conditions . 
  minimizes the effects of solar loading passively , radically lowering the vehicle inner temperature , creating better conditions for both personnel and electronic equipment and preventing the ballistic effects from temperature changes and shortens time for cooling down to operational temperature and lowering fuel consumption by minimizing the fuel used for cooling . 
  [ ... ] the mcs is optimized in colour , design and properties and can be adapted to any mission and theatre in hours and enhancing mission specific capability by the pallet of integrated features , as carrying system , shade net and shelters . 
  mcs provides simplified logistics and the vehicle can be prepared for training or any mission in any environment in hours without repainting or mounting complex add-ons as extra air condition . 
  so it 's not just thermal stealth .

  did they not drop fire bombs on london , too ? 
  or are they just not marked on the map ? 
  neither angola nor mozambique are desert territories ... 
  everybody - every body well played . 
  we also call north korea dprk sometimes . 
  that guy must have serious issues pressing the spacebar, 
  water and corn starch is probably the most well known non-newtonian fluids . 
  well , part of the outrage ( about s21 ) was about the lack of public involvement . 
  `` but the plans were on display ... '' `` on display ? 
  i eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them . '' `` that 's the display department . '' `` with a flashlight . '' `` ah , well , the lights had probably gone . '' `` so had the stairs . '' `` but look , you found the notice , did n't you ? '' `` yes , '' said arthur , `` yes i did . 
  it was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ` beware of the leopard . 
  vodka with corn starch, 
  when i 'm in charge of cooking : pea or lentil soup , spaghetti with tomato sauce , burritos , cabbage or sauerkraut stew otherwise : rice with kimchi and other korean sides , noodles with pork and black bean paste ( jajangmyeon ) , or fried rice koreans are far ahead of us in the `` cheap , quick and tasty '' department . 
   this is n't india and pakistan , ca . 
  this also is n't the cold war , ca . 
  [ 1967 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalina_affair ) , the russian-japanes border , [ ca . 
  1938 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93japanese_border_conflicts ) or the north korean border region , [ ca . 
  2010 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalina_affair ) would you kindly explain to me why exactly this conflict , and this time , makes it so much different ? 
  i ca n't quite follow you . 
   and then you have the wars that have started in a skirmish , but noone ever admitted it . 
  we would never know who fired the first shot . 
  and of those , which ones were wars where neither side had an interest in open warfare ? 
   the existance and presence of troops is always demonstrated intent to engage in warfare , much like owning a car is intent to drive around in it . 
  the exist *** e *** nce and presence of troops always demonstrated the willingness to fight a war , but not neccessarily the intent to do so . 
  do you really think the polish wanted to fight the germans in 1939 ? 
  yet they had an army stationed at the german border . 
  the existence of troops may also have the pure intent of simply continuing to exist ( as a nationstate ) , especially when your neighbour thinks of your people as `` untermenschen '' occupying formerly owned territory , and desperately wants more `` lebensraum '' . 
  the inherent centralization of catholicism can actually be a good thing in some cases . 
  the semi-centralized protestant religions in germany and scandinavia are also strictly against such beliefs , here they even offer seminaries to teach their members how to deal with creationists . 
   all it takes to start a war is a young russian private loosing his cool when he sees an apc approach . 
  you * really * think such an incident would a war to break if it actually were an accident ? 
  there are enough precedents for skirmishes at times of peace that * did not * spark a war , and there are plenty of skirmishes in times of peace that * intentionally * sparked a war . 
  if russia or america wants a war , sure , they 'll find a way . 
  but they wo n't do it because some dipshit loses his temper and fires a few rounds over the border . 
  neither of them will let some random retards dictate their foreign policy . 
  and you do n't need to have the intention of starting a war if you want to be ready for war . 
  there is no state of war between america and russia . 
  american troops deploying ( not mobilizing ) to another country is no act of war , and it 's not done in with the intention of provoking one . 
  the image you posted bears little similarity both in content and context . 
  similar to what ? 
  you ca n't make a cheap , insulated window . 
   raf did horrible things . 
  that 's the thing with extremists , they are always assholes . 
  in my opinion germany is suffering more under right-wing assholes than under left-wing assholes , but both deserve to be punished . 
  you know , i totally agree with that . 
  i never said that left wing extremists pose a greater threat . 
  all i said was that , so far , the largest terrorist organization was from the left wing - the raf . 
  now you can argue that the definition of a terrorist group is fuzzy at best , and that my statement was n't exactly accurate , but you did n't do that .
