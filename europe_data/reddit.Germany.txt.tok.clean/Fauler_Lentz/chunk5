  i do n't think this can be directly linked to capitalistic ideology . 
  germany simply has barely started to actually do what it 's been preaching for decades now - women still have to choose between job and children , and all attempts to fix it are half-hearted at best . 
  all we can offer are sanctions for companies that mistreat women taking pregnancy leave , but trying to find daycare to actually make use of that opportunity can be difficult . 
  meanwhile in france every child gets taken care of , and that shows in the statistics . 
  and they are every bit as capitalistic as we are . 
  sooner or later your dykes will grow to the size of our mountains anyway , and my parents ' home will become valuable beach property at the elbian sea . 
  damn !, 
  that 's 13m more !, 
  i 'm sure you guys could build one, 
  not only that , she is among the few non-incompetent people in the cdu . 
  she 's queen of germany and matriarch of [ clowns ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/guenther_h_oettinger_2007-portrait.jpg ) . 
  if you 're not with us , you 're against us , even if you 're born as one of us . 
  i hate the `` no true scotsman '' argument with a passion, 
  meanwhile , where i come from , [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/rit9w7v ) qualifies as `` mountains '' what would i give for some elevation . 
  i would n't say that . 
  fascism is explicitly antidemocratic , but fn does not have the goal of turning the state into a dictatorship . 
  they even use democratic elections within the party - they do n't have any sort of figure that would fill the role as authoritarian leader . 
  nationalism does n't equal fascism . 
  unless your name is g\u00fcnther , and you compare half your population to the taliban . 
   under the proposal , a german holidaymaker on their return would be reimbursed $ 500 euros by the german state on presentation of restaurant and hotel bills -- on condition that the hotel and eatery in question have paid their taxes . 
  that 's the proposal in the article . 
  it was restored in the 19th century , but the castle walls and all that were built much earlier . 
  at least according to the german wiki site . 
  the big difference between it and neuschwanstein is that it was actually used as a castle - it does n't just look like one, 
  hohenzollern is much older than that , the core was built in the 15th century, 
  but nk is no longer a threat . 
  it is no longer able to project any kind of power outside its borders because it 's industry is completely outdated , its weapons are obsolete and its agriculture has no means to support a war for an extended period of time . 
  sucks to be a north korean , but the south koreans can now live in relative peace as long as the regime in the north is working . 
  if russias economy collapses entirely , and if the power is consolidated even more , it 'll also be less influential and threatening on the world stage . 
  sucks for the russians , but ( assuming the nukes stay where they are ) the rest of the world is better off . 
  - we are also often `` turning mosquitoes into elephants '' ( aus einer m\u00fccke einen elefanten machen ) - when you 're screwed : `` i 'm sitting in ink '' ( ich sitz ' in der tinte ) - when someone is running away : `` he 's doing himself out of the dust '' ( er hat sich aus dem staub gemacht ) - if someone is doing something very unexpected : `` he is not from me , not from you ... '' ( er ist mir nichts dir nichts ... ) - when you 're not understanding something : `` i only understand train station '' ( ich versteh ' nur bahnhof ) - if you do n't care about something : it 's sausage to me '' ( ist mir wurst ), 
  stop discriminating us !, 
  the terms `` apprentice '' , `` journeyman '' and `` master '' come from the system of guilds craftsmen were forced into in ye olde days , and remnants of these systems are still in place in germany for various crafts . 
  the journeyman got his name because after the apprenticeship , if you wanted to become a master yourself ( a neccessity if you wanted to open your own shop in the guild system ) you had to go on a journey from town to town to learn under different masters , in order to spread knowledge . 
  nowadays this is no longer required , but some still choose to do it - mostly just to get around and meet new people , similar to work & travel . 
  craftsmen love their traditions . 
  you still see some actual [ journeymen ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/wandergeselle_02.jpg ) here in germany , and a chimney sweep with a uniform [ straight from the 19th century ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schornsteinfeger#mediaviewer/file:schornsteinfeger,_wanfried,_deutschland,_img_8113_edit.jpg ) is very common . 
  you should be glad they did n't enter a military alliance with [ geese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/us_airways_flight_1549 ), 
  is n't that a trainer ? 
  [ pilatus pc-9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pilatus_pc-9 ) is n't even supposed to be armed . 
  920kph and 13000m ceiling ... barely too much for spitfires . 
  just barely . 
  starting the day with a laugh is supposed to be healthy . 
  but since most of that is filtered out and disposed , it 's not really a big issue . 
  coal ash is a bigger problem if it 's not properly disposed , and these substances get into the ground water . 
  fucking eu regulation . 
  good thing you 're leaving , so we can take your share of the hate crime quota . 
  `` reflective '' in this case means that it 's not just shiny , but has retroreflectors which reflect right back to the source . 
   and in winter it might be kinda scary sometimes , but i 'm still alive  that 's the spirit !, 
  there are two important informal rules regarding the speed limit : 1 ) drive at least 10 over if you can , everyone else does it so you should do too . 
  2 ) a ticket for 20 over only costs a little bit of money . 
  above that will cost you your permit if you get caught repeatedly . 
  so basically , everyone drives between 10 and 20 over . 
  is n't rwd kinda bad in winter though ? 
  or do you all just carry concrete bricks in the trunk when roads are icy ? 
  it 's also worth considering that after so much of the landed nobility left the country , a lot of positions in the military became vacant all of a sudden , since the military was the playground of the nobility . 
  people from the lower rungs of the traditional pecking order now had a real chance of getting a proper command . 
  after all of that was over , a lot of people owed their position and wealth to the revolution , they would have never had a chance to move upwards otherwise . 
  milk production used to be regulated to prevent price fluctuations . 
  this regulation has been phased out , which led to an increase in production . 
  a lot of farmers have accrued debt to increase production , so they have no choice but to continue producing . 
  it 'll probably stabilize in the long term , but it 'll drive a lot of farmers out of business . 
  you know , it looks like you 're actually right . 
  there seems to be a rule saying that motorcycle brands are indeed feminin , likely from `` maschine '' . 
  likewise , car brands are masculin . 
  otherwise , brand names do n't usually have a gender , not just foreign ones . 
   how on earth is using a proper noun `` bizarre '' ? 
  if you look at a german dictionary , you wo n't find `` honda '' . 
  you know why that is ? 
  japanese people speak japanese , and have japanese names . 
  there are no rules concerning the gender of japanese words , and you 're free to apply any gender you like . 
  `` die '' is just customarily used . 
  is there any specific criticism , or just some meaningless phrases ? 
   with the reckless way the tories are carrying out brexit , its clear they do n't really give a shit how much damage they do to the island of ireland as a whole ( historically they never did ) . 
  well , the tories never did care . 
  but there was a great deal of engagement for the sake of the irish from the liberals during the late 19th century . 
  the fact that ireland almost got home rule before ww1 is often quietly put aside , for the sake of a convenient narrative . 
   would have happened no matter what . 
  you just replaced a gross simplification with a gross simplification . 
  how can you possibly know what would have happened in an alternate universe where the assassination did not happen ? 
  it 's simply a far too complex matter to make such bold assumptions . 
  to be fair though , the irish home rule bill was passed and forced past the house of lords , but then suspended due to ww1 . 
  in that alternative universe where some serbian dude did n't kill some austrian , it might have been a more peaceful way out . 
  merkel is a real asset to the cdu , even though there are probably a couple of people within the party waiting in line to take her position . 
  getting rid of her would probably make them lose a lot of support in the center - plenty of people are voting for the cdu just because of her , and i do n't see anyone else who could fill that role so well . 
  i imagine that gives her a lot of leverage to get what she wants . 
  make kpd great again !, 
  the dune is moving at a snails pace . 
  besides , the only thing keeping it from being overgrown by plants is the sand blowing on it from the shore . 
  the shifting sand is what prevents plants from growing there , so if it moves further inward , it will eventually turn into a regular hill . 
  we 've got 99 things to bitch about , and beer ai n't one !, 
  well , we do bitch a lot about beer prices abroad . 
  we 're just so used to more than ~ 2 $ / l being an outrageous price for beer , whereas that 's the bottom line in some neighboring countries . 
  ~ ~ bread and games ~ ~ vodka, 
  beer in particular ca n't get much cheaper than it is . 
  the beer tax is substantially lower than regular liquor tax . 
   because no tickets are available for average joe to a reasonable price . 
  it 's not that bad actually , unless you insist on first row seats . 
  lots of government money flows into subsidies for concert halls , and cheap seats are often sold for ~ 10 $ . 
  the only real problem is that the place is completely sold out for the foreseeable future .
