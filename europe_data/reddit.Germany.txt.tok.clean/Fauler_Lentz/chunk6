  the first reich was the fake roman empire though . 
  but you 're right , roman architecture had quite an impact on nazi architecture . 
  they did n't just imitate the look of some buildings , they also frequently used solid stone blocks instead of the more common brick and concrete . 
  after all , they wanted to last for a thousand years , so their architecture reflected that . 
  you missed a serious opportunity there : `` breitguard '', 
  i 'd say that is another thing the two have in common then . 
  it should n't . 
  average temperatures in january are typically somewhere around the freezing point . 
  due to the high amount of precipitation , december and january can be nasty though . 
  we just had a storm flood , and this morning there was freezing rain . 
  so people around here often wish nothing more than sustained , cold temperatures with snow , rather than the dark , murky and wet weather we 're getting right now . 
  is the `` r\u00f6stigraben '' the swiss equivalent of the [ `` wei\u00dfwurst\u00e4quator '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wei%c3%9fwurst%c3%a4quator#/media/file:karte_wei%c3%9fwurst%c3%a4quator.png ) ? 
  trichinella in pigs have been wiped out pretty much throughout europe as far as i know . 
  but as you said , it 's still around in boar , and some people are not aware that that poses a risk if you do n't cook it . 
   the only truly ethnicly homogenous areas are probably some mountainous areas . 
  like switzerland and tyrol :d you 're right though . 
  this idea that there are large contiguous areas of people with the same ethnic identity is recent . 
  if you put ( common ) people from frisia , slesvig , franconia and swabia into a single room 200 years ago , they probably would have found that idea to be outrageous . 
  and they would have had a fairly hard time even talking with each other . 
  trichinella eggs are fairly resilient . 
  cooking them will kill them , but salting , drying or smoking the meat may leave some alive . 
  i 've once seen a documentary about a small village in sardinia . 
  the people they showed there seemed a bit too patriarchial for my taste , but they made their own olive oil and salami . 
  an entire pig worth of salami for a single family . 
  that 's something i can get behind !, 
  that 's before bottling , shipping , retail and taxes . 
  i 'm all for potato candy . 
  a fridge that tends to get a bit overzealous and freezes the beer solid in some places . 
  there are not that many . 
  [ diakonie ] ( https://www.diakonie-hamburg.de/export/sites/default/.content/downloads/presse/22-04-zahlen-und-fakten-zur-aktuellen-situation-der-wl-in-hh.pdf ) estimates it 's around 2000 , and they [ officially counted ] ( https://www.hinzundkunzt.de/vendorsweek-5/ ) around 1000 who visited shelters and soup kitchens . 
  so that 's roughly 1/1000 . 
  my grandparents said they heard it all the way from gronau , 10 km away from the site . 
  that was a big fucking explosion . 
  can confirm though , looks nice now . 
  in the northern half , yes . 
  but that 's not usually considered to be northern germany , but rather the center . 
  i would say that the distinction between `` mountain '' and `` hill '' entirely depends on what 's normal in that area . 
  i 've always believed estonia to be about as flat as northern germany . 
  who would have thought that your highest mountain is about twice as high as anything we have to offer ? 
  you 're right , the australian criminal genes are truly a problem . 
  it 's even contagious , spreading to those who willingly emigrated there after it was no longer a prison colony . 
  hey , but at least it 's just criminal genes . 
  all those germans with nazi genes and russians with communist genes have it even worse amirite ? 
  everything less than ancap utopia is literally soviet union . 
  / r/hrr is still up for grabs . 
  i thought they put horse meat in that , not alcoholics . 
  a rather infamous example is the dutch treatment of the natives of [ the banda islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banda_islands#massacre_of_the_bandanese ) . 
  the local population was mostly wiped out and replaced with african slaves . 
  wow , that 's a lot of / r/iamverysmart material . 
  the funny thing about it is that they would all would have looked a lot different back then , with bright colors . 
  but probably not to their detriment . 
  it 's the same thing with castles . 
  we think of dim places , but in reality the interior walls were plastered and painted . 
  most likely . 
  they liked their democracy small though . 
  we say that in hindsight . 
  but back then , it was an experiment . 
  it also was n't particularly successful when it was introduced . 
  wages for workers were extremely low , and would remain so in spite of a rapidly growing economy , so they were n't exactly content with it . 
  the old age pension in particular was outright insulting : it started at an age of 71 years . 
  in some industries , there probably were no workers that old . 
  the importance of these laws is really for the most part that they provided a framework for more effective laws in germany and other countries later on . 
  should n't have drunk as much dhmo . 
  people who take it die . 
  it also looks beautiful once plants start to regrow . 
  there was a huge fire in the yellowstone park back in the 80s or so , and instead of replanting the entire forest , they just left it as it was . 
  while some areas had trees regrow almost immediately , others are still wide open , with bushes and flowering plants . 
  you can still see the burnt up trees in many places , proof of a much different looking landscape before the fire . 
  we 're no longer allowed to anschluss , so we had to resort to cultural appropriation . 
  really ? 
  how come then that lattice energy of some ionic solids exceed the bond strength of even triple bonds , for example metal oxides ? 
  is there something i 'm missing ? 
  ionic bonds are the strongest chemical bonds , which require the largest amount of energy to break . 
  sodium and chlorine atoms for example can bind to each other with an ionic bond , forming table salt . 
  if you pull them apart ( by solving or heating them to the melting point ) , the chlorine will keep one of the electrons of the sodium atom , so they are both ions ( = charged atoms ), 
  there are still patents on insulin ? 
  it 's been around for quite a while now . 
  edit : found the answer myself . 
  patents are on types of synthetic insulin , some of which are already expired , or will soon . 
  the first generic is apparently currently going through licensing in europe . 
   it probably costs a diabetic over 1000 a month with no insurance . 
  for real ? 
  that 's fucking insane . 
  i just looked up what an average monthly dose of insulin costs in germany : it 's [ about $ 70 per month ] ( http://www.diabetes-union.de/wie-hoch-sind-die-kosten-fuer-insulin/ ) . 
  testing equipment is n't mentioned there , but i would assume that it 's the cheaper part of the equation . 
  i 've heard that you guys have problems with healthcare costs , but i did n't know it can be more than an order of magnitude more . 
  i 'm curious , what 's the general french opinion about the de gaulle era ? 
  is it something people still argue about ? 
  false friends in a similar style are quite common . 
  here are some examples from korean : `` selca '' is a selfie , probably from self + camera . 
  `` bang '' is bread , from french `` pain '' . 
  it 's not just bread though , it 's pretty much everything made from baked dough , such as pizza crust or a flan base ( or whatever you call the thing you use for cake ) . 
  `` cider '' is a kind of lemonade , with neither apple nor alcohol `` huaiting '' , from `` fighting '' , is a cheer you 'll often hear at korean e-sports events . 
  not really a false friend , but kinda funny due to the - ing suffix . 
  japanese and chinese are probably also goldmines . 
  but i bet you could make one of these comics for pretty much any language out there . 
  hey , do n't be mean to the swiss !, 
  as far as i understand it , the teutonic knights were originally more like an occupation force , manning the castles they built outside of campaign season . 
  the actual fighting force also included european nobles who were out for adventure , as well as their retinue of employed soldiers . 
  being crusader was immensely prestigious , and could seriously improve their status when they came home .
