  personally i 'm not someone who demands the national anthem to be played at every event . 
  i just ca n't stand people who can not distinguish patriotism from nationalism and who try to forbid pleasurable feelings towards the own country . 
  in my opinions it severely dampens the process of coming to terms with the past . 
  so is germany . 
  that number should at least be somewhere in the 40 % area . 
  i read somewhere that with counting in ex-smokers you 're already at about 60 % . 
  i 'd argue about the scepticism towards technology being a `` german '' thing . 
  in my opinion it 's more of an old people thing , something the country has in abundance . 
  i know this may sound like pirate party campaigning , but we have ministers who do n't read emails not printed out and a technology minister who says he has lackeys to do `` this whole internet zeugs '' for him . 
  additionally to that comes the fear of being constantly watched by technology , fueled by a certain dictatorship that ended barely 20 years ago . 
  in the free market technological requirements are very high actually . 
  the problem is that thusly educated people stay in the economy and make money rather than do politics . 
  also , if germany were a dwarven kingdom us northerners would probably still be humans then , with all the trade and the ships . 
   i thought spd and linke ca n't see eye to eye ? 
  historically they could n't , but the spd now has a very strong or at least very vocal left wing under andrea nahles due to some restructuring after losing the elections in 2009 . 
  they do share certain viewpoints , they differ on just as many . 
  red-red-green has already `` worked out '' in certain state parliaments , but as said above , the spd leadership has stated not to cooperate with the linke on federal level . 
  although in my opinion they may spontaneously do so on the eve of the 22nd of september . 
  as the first german to post here , bismarck or adenauer . 
  both were exceptional politicians who did a lot in their time , and both also did some bad things . 
  adenauer certainly did less things which i 'd object with , but bismarck 's work was historically more noteable , finally unifying the germanies and such . 
  or if they do something about forbidding mein kampf already . 
  there is/was a saying in germany : `` the bavarian is a mixup between austrians and humans '' . 
  you know there 's more to it if a people elects a foreigner , a cripple , a fattie and a gay man to let them tell you something about a master race . 
  i believe you have to go to an employment office and be listed as unemployed in order to get into that statistic . 
  to do that you need to have lost an actual job , to be in education or training i think you are back in school or doing internships , meaning that you do n't get unemployment money anymore . 
  one issue is that the old world exclusively goes by jus sanguis instead of jus solis . 
  a child of albanian immigrants born in belgium will not get belgian citizenship by virtue of his birthplace . 
  also europe is a continent packed with countries and countless regions with unique cultures going back at least 2000 years of recorded history . 
  at the same time the idea of a unified europe and a combined european identity was not very successful in the last years . 
  in america the message is clear . 
  you may not speak the language when you arrive , but your kids will be american . 
  as such they have to go to american schools , learn english and are encouraged to identify with a country that proudly is a melting pot . 
  in europe not so much . 
  it is made clear to you that neither you nor your children will be `` true '' members of the respective country , even with citizenship . 
  the different cultural background is basically viewed as an impassable difference , so you are allowed to `` keep '' it . 
  the first generation approves of this , it 's less of a culture shock if you can move into a neighbourhood with people from your native region . 
  they help you get settled , can help you out with adjusting to the finer points of life in europe , and you are n't forced to break the habits of your culture . 
  enter the second generation . 
  they grow up `` between two chairs '' , and because this leads to disapproval from both sides , they often feel extorted to `` choose '' to either adapt the european culture ( which they never will truly be part of ) or stick with their family and friends ( who take pride in being different and partly refuse to interact with the natives at all ) . 
  this of course leads to extremism . 
  well in larger numbers renting a flight from the flugbereitschaft ( they also have airline-grade machines like a320 ) is cheaper than organising a train trip . 
  not to mention quicker . 
  i get what you 're saying , but that 's phrasing it as a no true scotsman argument . 
  factually she is a feminist , feminism is a wide set of ideologies of which some encompass misandry / [ insert ] phobia . 
  she is a racist , but she 's also a feminist . 
  just like christians can be child rapists or muslims can be is functionaries . 
  she happens to subscribe to a brand of feminism which combines her attitudes , and it may be an entirely calculated move rather than an honest belief , but that does n't make it `` not feminism '' . 
  if the recently introduced idea of sharing tanks with holland is a good barometer , german participation will go as far as to build , sell and possibly even maintain the tanks . 
  good for the economy , good for the german guilt , bad for everything else . 
  [ you sure about that ? ] ( http://www.bmvg.de/portal/a/bmvg/!ut/p/c4/04_sb8k8xllm9msszpy8xbz9cp3i5eyrphk9pnyydl3y1mzi4qts5ay9lpzyvjz8xjri_yjsr0uaihdqgq !, 
  ! / ) schmidt-schnauze was very explicit about a new edition coming out every year during his time as dm . 
   jan techau , a former defence official at carnegie europe , said : `` this is the time of a new germany . 
  this is probably the first time a german defence white paper is something like important . '' i do n't know if i should laugh or get mad at this bullshit . 
  is he honestly thinking that because the last ministers could n't be bothered to write a white paper ( a paper outlining germany 's foreign policy goals , threats and the role of the military , it used to come out every year but has n't since 2006 ) that this one would make that much of an impact ? 
  most politicians and almost the entire populus could n't care less about what the mod thinks . 
  there was a time though : during the cold war . 
  but it 's not hard to see where they are going with this . 
  a military is expensive , germans absolutely loathe their soldiers and would love to see the military gone entirely , and last year several glaring equipment problems surfaced to light , all traceable to the civilian cheapskates in charge of budgets who scrimped the materiel to pieces . 
  the costs of getting the entire bundeswehr up to working order right now are estimated at 100bn $ including procurements , which the dm wants to get over a course of 10 years . 
  this is n't going to happen though . 
  in the world they imagine germany gets all of the benefits of an own army with none of the costs , so they push for a european army paid for and maintained by almost exclusively other countries . 
  that way we can also prove once and for all that we are n't nazis .

  or for more academic approaches : [ prager ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqyrfloqfc ) . 
  if you actually got paid less for the exactly same work , take your employer to court and spend the next few years rolling around in settlement money . 
   by that logic , die linke is , or briefly was , pan german as well i do n't know a single person wo ever disputed that . 
  they emerged from the pds , which undoubtably was pan-german . 
  and the longest german word with no repeating letters is heiz\u00f6lr\u00fccksto\u00dfabd\u00e4mpfung . 
  oh it 's already going on alright . 
  here in hamburg there 's a weird gang war going on between kurds , turks and assyrians , because new arrivals of one of the groups decided to start manhunts for the others . 
  did n't transnistria also officially request entry into the russian federation a few years ago ? 
  the strictness about tasers stems from the assumption that a tased individual might have a heart condition , meaning that you are n't supposed to accidentally kill someone ( germany has very strict definitions of commensurability ) . 
  pepper spray depends on the environment you move in . 
  first of all it mus n't be specific anti-human spray , the case needs to have the note `` for protection against animals '' on it , otherwise it is considered a weapon and illegal to carry . 
  secondly you judically commit battery against anyone you spray by accident , meaning that it is not a good idea to pull out the spray in a crowded or closed off area like a subway tube or the situation in cologne . 
  in those situations a kubotan / `` tactical pen '' would be the better idea , but that requires you knowing what you 're doing . 
  in any case , never use the spray in crowded areas . 
  you should know by now that people are just applying for the `` small permit '' ( kleiner waffenschein ) , which is two levels beneath the firearm possession card that you have . 
  all german outlets i 've seen have been very vocal about this not affecting the big permit or the possession card applications . 
  as to why , a neighbour had his cellar broken into twice this year already . 
  his pregnant wife is currently home at all times . 
  in what way are coloured people dehumanised if the police starts referring to the appearance of perpetrators ? 
  it is a very important factor for cops in case of a manhunt or in order to find out if it 's a serial perpetrator . 
  if you honestly think that facts dehumanise a group of 1.2 million people , you do n't believe in the state of law that puts the individual right ( of the victim to have your attacker identified ) over the collective `` right '' of no hurt feelings . 
   the only reason they were in the past because they `` had been infected with jewry '' : for the nazis , bolshevism was all a jewish plot . 
  nope , they were considered `` fremdrassig '' and as lesser beings by the wilhelmian administration , which continued in the nuremberg laws ( meaning no marriage or kids allowed ) and lebensraumpolitik was hitlers biggest seller from the get-go . 
  the plan always was to kill off the natives of the newly conquered regions , which supposedly were remnants of a lesser race , and replace them with germans , similar to what stalin would later do with eastern prussia . 
  and while i agree that neonazis make it up as they go along , i have yet to see a russian who would break bread with a nazi to save his life . 
  he knows that , he just considers hamburg to be number one . 
  i generally would n't put it past them either , but it 's way more likely that the case happened indepently and they 're just piggybacking . 
  remember , nazis hate slavs . 
  they do n't consider them people . 
  if it was an orchestrated hoax they would n't use a russian girl , simply because their minions would n't care as much .

  tl ; dr : you 're either as far left as possible , or you 're a nazi . 
  supposedly there 's no in between . 
  mostly the `` black block '' , the somewhat organised violent protestors/autonomous leftists . 
  there are also some complete loonies among the gender community . 
  nope , there are plenty of males who caught the ire of the regressives and paid the price .
