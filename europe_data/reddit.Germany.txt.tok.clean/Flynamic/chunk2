  i was talking about the use of language , primarily . 
  if you can back up these numbers and give a scientific foundation of your claim , then sure , it may be a rational conclusion . 
  that is the question : do really 80 % have those ideas ? 
  do you really think that being part of an islamic religion makes 80 % automatically have abhorrent thoughts ? 
  and are 5 % of * any * people you import criminal , not only 5 % of muslims/refugees ? 
  do you think that integration is impossible because of their culture ? 
  if you exaggerate these numbers or make them up , or making the conclusion that the solution to the crisis is simply stopping any immigration everywhere in europe ** without providing alternatives ** for the refugees , just to `` defend your culture '' , then one might think that you follow racist tendencies . 
  you recognize racist parties when you see one - for individuals , one would have to look into your mind to be really sure of your intentions , of course - being simply worried or following an anti-immigration agenda for the sake of it . 
  is n't this international news reporting local news ? 
  there was no `` invitation '' ... 
  the refugees suggested all by themselves that the best chance is germany who gives them shelter . 
  all merkel said was that some bureaucracy the germans are famous for were to be set temporarily out of order . 
  i agree there should be controls , and there are ( not that strict , i admit , but it 's getting better as authorities adapt ) . 
  and there should have been preparation , but as often in politics , no one can or want to predict the future and instead act reactionary and populist . 
  but what would have been the solution ? 
  that all eu countries just shut their borders ? 
  that does not work for greece - as you know , greece ca n't handle it alone . 
  the eu needs to work together , that 's all i know , i have no answers as well , but saying it 's all germany 's fault does not lead anywhere . 
  i mean , if anything , it 's assad 's fault :3, 
  you are a sovereign state , how you respond to the crisis is your decision . 
  germany or the eu did not tell you to shout `` not our problem '' . 
  so either do not complain and be happy that germany is taking the load , or question your own response that prevented a relatively even distribution of refugees among europe . 
  you 're saying that muslims as individuals may be good people , but at the same time you want to imply that being part of a religion , which always has to be interpreted by individuals ( ideas without humans are just ideas after all ) makes people automatically follow a certain path . 
  are all muslims shi'ites ? 
  are all christians following the catholic church ? 
  do you visit the church regularly ? 
  finding violent and western-incompatible values in islam , christianity and judaism is one thing , you may label the religion hateful . 
  i do n't think that religions are the source of peace as well . 
  but to what extend are you then able to label muslims as such ? 
  if just the ideology is hateful , but the majority of muslims is not , then that argument for not letting muslims in the country is void nonetheless . 
  only if you say `` the migrants/refugees/muslims rape our women so we need to stop the mass immigration '' then i would think of you as kinda racist ( not necessarily a nazi , since i want that term to stay serious ) . 
  blaming the perpetrators that are part of some foreign group/race is acceptable and the right thing to do . 
  concluding that to all members of the group is not . 
  i do n't get how some people are crying over pc and being called nazis or racists when they are fulfilling the definition of racism . 
  decent minds are able to accept that complex situations do n't have simple answers . 
  while you do have a point , there are parallels to the 1930s that are quite interesting ( translation in a comment ) : https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/42c5ta/zeitungsmeldung_badeverbot_f%c3%bcr_juden_aus_dem_jahr/, 
  so would you say that you hate muslims ? 
  1 ) the root of the problem is syria and the appealing wealthy and safe european union in geographical reach of north africa and the middle east . 
  germany did not invite anyone , the refugees were already here when the statements were given . 
  2 ) some of the ideas are european values . 
  not letting anyone in or refusing to help like hungary did shouting `` not my problem '' is no help either . 
  germany tried but of course we ca n't handle it alone . 
  so `` we can do it '' as said by merkel was wrong , yes . 
  but it 's a european problem , not a german problem like orban said . 
  we live in a globalized world , and you have to deal with it . 
  well to be fair she never said that her current policy is the solution . 
  i do n't think it 's all about proving points , i mean this is a crisis where you can not win , really . 
  yep , communication is the key to solutions . 
  thanks . 
  the source you gave says that syrians make up 54 % of applicants in december 2015 and 35.9 % in 2015 ( yet in both statistics the biggest source of asylum seekers ) . 
  so it is up to you to define `` current '' . 
  not speaking of the fact that not only syrians can be refugees , afghanistan and iraq are second to syria on this list . 
  still , i do n't quite understand your response to / u/rx-bandit . 
  he talks about taking in refugees , not migrants in general . 
  could you give a source please ? 
  ( just interested ), 
  journalism is not entirely about reporting facts . 
  they usually conform to a press codex , e.g. 
  not publishing personal information about victims . 
  german press code , section 12 says :  when reporting crimes , it is not permissible to refer to the suspect ` s religious , ethnic or other minority membership unless this information can be justified as being relevant to the readers ` understanding of the incident . 
  in particular , it must be borne in mind that such references could stir up prejudices against minorities . 
  yes , yes there are, 
  that was a rather incompetent journalist . 
  she said that she and other journalists censored themselves regarding the immigration topic when they were actually just conforming to the press codex . 
   when reporting crimes , it is not permissible to refer to the suspect ` s religious , ethnic or other minority membership unless this information can be justified as being relevant to the readers ` understanding of the incident . 
  in particular , it must be borne in mind that such references could stir up prejudices against minorities section 12 , deutscher pressekodex , presserat https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf, 
  kids today , always complaining about education !, 
  exactly . 
  there are multiple types of migrants . 
  economic migrants , official refugees , real refugees , asshole refugees , thankful refugees , etc. 
  we like to group them together and argue against or in favour of all of them based on properties only some of them share . 
  holy shit that was fast . 
  edit : why not ? 
  * absurd !, 
  ridiculous !, 
  * i get it . 
  now i have a question for you : can americans ever become europeans ? 
  and if so , why ? 
  great argument . 
  just repeat your hypothesis/opinion and say everything else is absurd . 
  they can become citizens and enjoy life with their new countrymen . 
  you can be european by heritage and european by citizenship . 
  two different things . 
  and by the way , the us for example is not defined by ethnicity . 
  a nation is defined by `` language , culture , territory '' , not ethnicity , anyway . 
  you got a misconception there . 
  so you deem people unfit to live with you based on origin or race only ? 
  they 're not like you so fuck them basically ? 
  so you in return would be allowed to migrate to africa since your ancestors came from africa as well ? 
  and africans would be forever unable to migrate to every other continent in the world since they decided to stay ? 
  at one point your logic breaks up : there has been migration from to any nation on earth for thousands of years , and now you decide to say \u201e this continent for us only , stay out `` . 
  when do you draw the line in history ? 
  our planet belongs to every human . 
  i will not further argue with your blatant ignorant inhuman values . 
  we got over people like you 70 years ago . 
  you want things to stay the way they are and keep ** ethnically ** non-europeans out , regardless of their values and opportunities . 
  you do n't want to give them a chance to ** become ** european in the first place . 
  this is tribalism and , because you said  if the canadians and australians are white , then that is ok . europe is where they came from , after all . 
  apparently racism . 
  i 'm not saying your position is wrong or bad , just that it fits the definitions nicely .
