   it looks good to me , cause a direct election would favour the big states , while the current system is considered ( rightly or wrong ) undemocratic . 
  sounds like he talked about the eu . 
  and the new plan is to make sure third world countries get fucked without bothering us , while we get slightly less fucked . 
  i agree with you in general , but unfortunately the guess was right ...  you bet it 's because of racism . 
  they are not european in the slightest . 
  they have 0 right to settle here . 
  racism is what is going to protect europe and keep it european into the future . 
  without `` racism '' , europe will cease to be european and it will be rapidly africanized and foreignized by hordes of eager foreigners running across the borders - / u/kittenmittens700, 
  switzerland is unlivable ? 
  he did an ama a couple of months ago . 
  he even voiced a character in rick and morty . 
  you should also look up klaus kinski or watch [ this famous video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75adi9p2why ) . 
  i just assumed it were mostly young people who do vandalism and activism for those kind of issues . 
  fascinating how even such small things as graffiti on a bridge give us an insight into history : it is not even the main motif of the photo yet we learned what young people thought at the time . 
  yep . 
  i was trying not to discredit serious criticism from other europeans who have different experiences and situations than we have ; i do n't see any serious disadvantages of the eu other than not enough communication between populace and institutions ( which is not always the eu 's fault ) . 
  thanks for the answer . 
  i thought that while many people in the uk are against the eu , most of them would know that it does n't have * that * much negative influence on their daily lives and that real issues lie beneath the surface . 
  i do n't think they really believe that , but it tells a lot about how the eu is presented in the press that such articles are possible . 
  he is implicated because he is n't mentioned ( or else it would n't be implicit ) , a `` close friend '' of him is ( who plays cello or something ) . 
  there are connections to him ; he is not stupid , of course his name is n't mentioned . 
  eh , bbc and most european publicly funded news stations are not used to promote the `` truth of the government '' . 
  that guy is french , he puts the u before the e when saying eu . 
  mars . 
  `` did you just assume my elements ? '', 
  yeah it would be certainly more satisfying to actually see the success . 
  the future of space travel !, 
  i guess they have better instruments for that than depending on human vision . 
  one reason why many deportations are n't possible is because countries like afghanistan refused to take their citizens back . 
  this reason is now gone in this case . 
   as long as we 're not able to store massive amount of energy in a affordable fashion , you 'll always need a fossil source that can fulfill the demand no matter the power output of your other ( green ) sources . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uz6xofwi4a one idea is basically making batteries of electric vehicles sell their energy back to the power grid . 
  and i did not say otherwise nor do i disagree with you . 
  they do n't want a single refugee . 
  nobody calls for mass immigration to countries like poland , so i would indeed call this stance radical . 
  it is understandable considering eastern europe has not much experience in immigration , so they are naturally hostile to these kind of ideas . 
  keep in mind that being moderate usually involves making compromises . 
  of course , i 'm exaggerating . 
  a majority talks about england ( for convenience , not so much ignorance ) when they mean the uk . 
  we do n't have those fancy abbreviations . 
  this was the territory of prussia : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/preu%c3%9fen#/media/file:deutsches_reich_ ( karte ) _ preu % c3 % 9fen . svg while prussia does not exist anymore , states like nrw recognize their prussian heritage : https://www.nrw-stiftung.de/projekte/projekt.php?pid=541 east prussia however would in fact not be a part . 
  yes . 
  but show the union jack to anyone in germany and they will say it 's england . 
  the biggest european megalopolis axis is the [ blue banana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) , for reference . 
  what about the us ? 
  apart from the trumpets i can imagine them being in favour of good relations with the eu . 
  or they at least have no opinion at all . 
  they like us probably more than we like them . 
  no offence slovenia , but pls no, 
  you 're right , sorry . 
  i was trying to find a map which shows the names of the states . 
  the situation on the french beach recently for example could be seen as a violation of human dignity , being forced to take off your clothes in front of everyone . 
  yes , i was trying to say it 's not a burqa they would wear there , but a niqab . 
  well , in syria they usually wear a niqab , and even their government banned them from schools due to their secular education model . 
  they might as well try to fit in and comply for the time they are here , do n't you think ? 
  the last weeks yes , but over the whole year so far ? 
  i doubt that . 
  i am confused as to why you get criticized . 
  in east germany there were already pogrom-like incidents , e.g. 
  the refugee bus in clausnitz . 
  it is not hard to imagine something like this happening on a larger scale throughout some parts of europe . 
  and the fact that you do not hear much from extremist parties in greece when they have more reasons than we have in northern europe is quite fascinating ; it may have to do with their mentality , or some level of experience being stuck in a crisis . 
  i * loved * that game , but there are also bus simulators like scs bus driver . 
  you could even drive a prison bus . 
  fun times . 
  of course some do n't speak for millions . 
  the point is that we ca n't judge them by association , and this particular act of solidarity shows that it can be both ways . 
  haha , yes that happened too . 
  we have a sub for that / r/600euro and a map [hoaxmap.org ] ( http://hoaxmap.org/ ), 
  if your morals are utilitarian , that 's fine , since you 're right that morals are of course personal and not absolute , and in that sense it can be indeed morally flawed . 
  the geneva convention however is based on human rights , so the right to asylum is actually founded in the base values of western civilization , so i was confused that anyone would argue that the text itself is morally wrong ; the consequences may be bad in certain situations , but ruling by the text itself on a individual human-to-human basis it is generally selfless and based on good will ( according to kant ) . 
  at least that is my interpretation . 
  i just thought we had a consensus that this law and the convention are morally good , and that only in the real world it makes problems . 
  but taking refugees is * morally * considered to be the right thing , in general , because it is literally helping people . 
  regardless of what you said , you can not say that it is * morally * flawed . 
  just flawed , if you will . 
  `` morally '' flawed ? 
  the word `` liberal '' is somehow synonym for left in the us , but can , as you say , mean nothing in other countries . 
  here in germany the liberal party is economically right , yet values personal freedoms without being a union workers party . 
  so rather `` libertarian '' . 
  what we can say about liberals in general is only that they value certain freedoms , but where they sit on the axes depends on the party . 
  i find this [ chart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_spectrum#/media/file:political_chart.svg ) useful for that matter . 
  that 's why i said `` attributed '' . 
  it is a matter of arguing and context to say what is left and right , but usually the position of the party is determined by its core values . 
  `` right '' in a social context is attributed to conservative , `` left '' to progressive values . 
  family policy , work policy , view of women . 
  so the hate speech of far-right extremists should be respected , but not the hate speech of islamists ? 
  what 's your point ? 
  are her policies not responsible for those incidents ( excluding munich ) in the eyes of many here ? 
  i thought you agree with this notion . 
  maybe the word used in the poll was not `` justified '' and he just explained what he remembers . 
  until we see the poll , i do n't see how such a discussion is useful for either side . 
  she barely uses rhetoric . 
  have you listened to her speeches ? 
  it 's boring and monotone . 
  her policies might be responsible , though . 
  and things like these are dividing us europeans . 
  because we hear completely different stories . 
  thanks to this sub , we can clarify or at least acknowledge misunderstandings . 
  he considered himself german and was born here .
