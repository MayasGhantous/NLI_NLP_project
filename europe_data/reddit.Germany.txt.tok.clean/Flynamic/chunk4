  he was not ethnically german ( only half ) . 
  what is your problem ? 
  was it an act of terror , with a political motive/motive of spreading fear ? 
  cologne was not terrorism . 
  oh yes the situation could n't have been handled worse . 
  but giving germany and france the fault for doing something because we are apparently too `` pc '' makes me sad ... what did other countries propose ? 
  the situation late 2015 needed a quick solution , and here we are still with no plan how to proceed with european unity . 
  i do n't know , but even if the percentage is low , there are still muslims on the way to integration , there are muslims who have difficulties but are peaceful , and there are also those on the edge . 
  none of them should be recruited by isis in case of a war . 
  we are already experiencing previously normal muslims , and also converts , who go to syria and join them . 
  do you think we have those refugees here in germany because we are nice to them or because we are nice to greece and hungary ? 
  because these refugees ca n't just stop existing , they need to go somewhere . 
  this is the situation . 
  is communism or nazism banned ? 
  here in de , the swastika is banned because it was the party emblem , and the party is forbidden , not the ideology . 
  you can only ban concrete things , as we live in constitutional states . 
  if they shout unconstitutional shit , neo nazis and salafists alike are tried for volksverhetzung . 
  how would you ban a religion of hate ? 
  suspicious mosques are already observed in germany by the verfassungsschutz . 
  it just means that this is n't new , it 's just another period of european terrorism . 
  these `` new normal '' comments contribute nothing , and running away from problems contribute nothing . 
  it is and will keep being easy for crazy people and islamists to kill and spread fear . 
  in this case , we have to deal with this as long as is is alive . 
  no , he said middle ages . 
  oh no , it 's retarded . 
  because in some countries , there is a right to asylum . 
  why would she want to do that if she repeatedly called for other european countries to take some so we have less pressure ? 
  the `` invitation '' was due to the situation in hungary , because there were too many refugees at one place . 
  quite radical stance you have there . 
  some of the accounts are useful for intelligence . 
  now that 's a bit different than 2000 ** rapes ** is n't it ? 
  quit your bullshit . 
  edit : oh , and austria , switzerland , finland and sweden were also part of the statistic . 
   2000 rapes source ? 
  many people are afraid of spiders , yet only few actually kill humans . 
  if you are afraid of muslims , it is not less irrational . 
   how are ** syrian and iraqi ** refugees in any way relevant to this ? 
  i think this sounds easier than it is . 
  we give religions , ideas and books too much credit . 
  you generally do n't commit crimes or blow up yourself if you do n't have any * real * problems . 
  those crazy people see this isis propaganda and feel empowered , mainly through their religion . 
  but is it the root cause ? 
  fairly not . 
  those terrorists are lucky that they share the same religion with unstable minds all over the world ; there 's a billion of them , after all . 
  it gives them a `` reason '' to kill for in their heads . 
   if you 're going to deport them , why would we care where they go ? 
  if we deport them , there has to be a destination . 
  would n't that be murphy 's law ? 
  they know best what fucked means . 
  you want to shoot unarmed civilians ? 
  are you the gdr ? 
  civil wars are different from nation wars . 
  in the case of syria , it 's pretty much a lost cause now . 
  it feels personal to many of us . 
  the eu is also a political and humanitarian union , but the united kingdom only ever sees it as an economic one . 
  that 's why you insist that it 's not personal and that we would keep being good neighbors and all that , while in reality you made things worse . 
  after your media and politicians repeatedly talked shit and lies about the eu , how brussels acts like hitler , the damn germans telling you what to do , et cetera . 
  your farage came to the ep , insulted them , and then demanded a trade deal and good relationships . 
  of course he does n't speak for his country , but many europeans see this as insulting and ca n't understand what we did to you , these things damage your reputation . 
  i promise you the relationship is not going to get better , your country did everything to ensure that , because if your politicians keep acting so selfish , we wo n't view you as reliable partners . 
  future governments also ca n't change treaties and deals without the other party agreeing to it . 
  but the government agreed to the directives originally . 
   i do n't understand what you mean ? 
  in terms of negotiating experience . 
  but we already have that , it 's called the eu . 
  i mean , if the uk could not be happy within the eu , their biggest partners with the longest political/trade/cultural relationship , and despite various opt-outs , why would they be more successful on their own with the rest of the world ? 
  it seems whatever they 're negotiating , they are not happy with the deal and want more instead of agreeing to compromise . 
  with countries like the usa and china , the uk is going to have less negotiating power than the eu , no matter how good their negotiators are - the uk is not canada , australia or the us , they 're still tiny in comparison . 
  and even if the deal is good , the people of the uk would complain about it anyway . 
   countries do n't have friends . 
  some have . 
  we 'll find out in november . 
  brexit was practically mid-season finale if you think about it . 
  what if it 's the hair of johnson and trump that make the decisions ? 
  what if ... they control them ?

  this alone shows that there should not have been a referendum in the first place . 
  ceo ? 
  head of x ? 
  supervisor ? 
  director ? 
  commander ? 
  prime minister ? 
  try to balance your media input instead of only reading leftist blogs . 
  but do n't over correct , or you land on far right blogs that tell you what leftists say to further outrage you . 
  usually executive and judicative are separated . 
  wtf . 
  the wrestler ? 
   you can quantify diversity in a number of ways that was my point ; he did not specify originally what he meant with `` diverse '' . 
  hey , we 're hated too !, 
  we do n't even have to argue that europe is more diverse than the us ; it 's enough to say that the us is in no way more diverse than europe , because `` diverse '' is a vague term in itself . 
  if we ever fight against aliens and unite all nations , we should call ourselves homoimperium . 
   compared to the mess created by the tories of course , they do n't kill civilians with drones , but for american standards the current administration was pretty okay . 
  it 's a vaccine . 
  it 's ironic at best , it says more about the uk than about the us . 
  the current us government / foreign policy is reasonable and not rushed , compared to the mess created by the tories . 
  there 's more to this story . 
  i suggest you read up on it , because the case was nowhere as clear as the comment makes it look like . 
  it 's just not what i would expect from a honest , caring politician . 
  good statesmen think beyond the next election/referendum and are there for their people if they really believe in what they 're doing , if they really love their country .
