  huh ... [ intentional homicides per 100,000 people ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/vc.ihr.psrc.p5 ) just divide it by 100.000 ... , 
  i 'm bored ... so i looked it up . 
  it 's around 1000 people a year according to bbc . 
  that would be 2.74 per day -  around 8 people per weekend . 
  so you were n't far off , brudi . 
  note : those are abolute numbers , not per capita ... 
  oktoberfest is from 16.09 . till 03.10 . this year ... , 
  well , did you ? 
  honestly i never even heard of it ... but sounds like a nice idea !, 
  well , it 's true for me and all people in my surroundings ( from all imaginable professions ) . 
  that \u00b4 s mine , too !, 
  p : liked the movie ? 
  me : what ? 
  * mwap * p : liked the movie ? 
  me : ... . . what ? 
  p : did you like the movie ?? 
  me : ... . hahahaha , me too ! ... . 
  normally per month . 
  only when speaking about taxes the amount per years becomes relevant .

  i 'm living in munich atm and i can agree wholeheartedly with that !, 
   also , the nearest major cities ( seattle , denver , salt lake city and minneapolis ) are like at least 300 miles away not really . 
  bavaria is densely populated and has a lot of interesting cities , too . 
  even in the `` nature and landscape parts '' of bararia ( alps ) there are a lot of cities like garmisch oder berchdesgarden . 
  middle franconia here ...  [ opentesaurus ] ( https://www.openthesaurus.de/synonyme/edit/17426 ) [ there is even a beer type named after it ... ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwickelbier ), 
  i think in bw , too . 
  germany : - for the 2 $ coin : zwickel ( from two = zwei ) - some people call the plural of euro `` euronen '' . 
  like one euro , two euronen . 
  not to use in a formal setting . 
  - in the years after the introduction , some people called it ironical `` teuro '' as a mixture from teuer ( expensive ) and euro , because it felt prices went up . 
  - then there are all the nicknames for money in general . 
  like `` zaster '' , `` moneten '' , `` knete '' ... 
  i read somewhere it 's origins lie in a turkish filler word . 
  `` alda '' or something like that . 
  times in our region : ca . 
  7:00 breakfast , 12:00 lunch , 18:00 dinner = 3 meals lunch is normally the largest , but in reality many people work/are in school till 16/17 :00 , so dinner is when you eat warm ... fast food is pretty big among the youth , not so much with older people . 
  depends . 
  some people go almost every week , while others ( like me ) like 3/4 times in one years . 
  more often when on vacation ... 
  living in bavaria i have never heard habibi , dadash , brate , bratko or abi ... 
  german : - alter - kumpel - digger - kollege - spezi on german reddit : - brudi,

   some folks in bielefeld he 's one of them !, 
  based on a kind of lost situation : - tape measure - how else would you define your side of the island ? 
  - towel aka fast occupation tool - how else would you claim the best parts of the island directly before sunrise ? 
  - shovel - how else would you dig trenches and build ramparts around your part of the island ? 
  now the german can die peacefully of thirst in his own , entrenched and measured part of the island , knowing he had done everything he could to combat the immediate threads . 
  none tbh . 
  because the eu is more than a economic union . 
  i went on a road trip from la to yosemite and then las vegas/grand canyon . 
  we drove a lot on the interstate , but also on smaller roads and never saw a really bad road between the cities . 
  bigger roads were not as smooth as at home , but then again you have a speed limit . 
  smaller roads were surprisingly good , even in the lonelier parts of the national parks . 
  the roads and sidewalks in la and in lv were often terrible , though . 
  not only in bad condition , but also dirty and confusing ( espec . 
  the markings . ) . 
  the airports ( la , lv and san francisco ) were top notch . 
  i ca n't say anything about trains ... 
  well , if you only want to do germany and iceland that 's fine i guess . 
  why should do visit something you do n't like ? 
  but make sure you know what you 're in for when visiting oktoberfest . 
  if you need a little distraction from all the drunk tourists i would recommend a day-trip ( with the train ; ca . 
  2h to reach from munich ) to [ tegernsee ] ( http://www.mein-tegernsee.de/wp-content/gallery/fotos-042012-aprilwetter/tegernsee-april-006.jpg ) in the alps . 
  you could do some [ hiking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpylbxlhflc ) . 
  also if you 're in iceland , consider taking a [ golden circle tour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox5sfoneevs ) ( or drive by yourself ) . 
  the golden circle is a roundtrip from reykjavik to some of the most beautiful sights in iceland , like volkanoes , geysirs , rifts ... 
  definitely choose berlin over munich ... or go to cologne , frankfurt a.m. or dresden . 
  it 's a bit overlooked , because you do n't have much problems . 
  but portugal is becoming quite popular for vacation , at least among my friends . 
  very nice towns like porto and lissabon ; with cheap flights , too . 
  climate is a bit cooler than mediterranean countries . 
  landscape should not be too flat i guess . 
  also portugal can fulfill all my tungsten needs for my panzers in hearts of iron iv ... 
  t r i g g e r e d / s, 
  * do your history classes incorporate moral judgments ( cruel/appropriate/justified / unjustified/right/wrong , etc ) ? 
  * yes . 
  but in theory the pupils should make up their own mind . 
  ( which is hard if the teacher is choosing the material ... ) * do your classes about the asian theater of ww2 mainly discuss the atomic bombs ? 
  * mainly . 
  for the pacific theater there are around 90 ( max ! ), 
  reserved . 
  so you have to teach about `` island hopping '' and the japanese occupation of korea ( etc. ) . 
  then go straight to the bombs . 
  the focus is mostly about the question if the bombs were justified and the implications for the future ( cold war ) ... 
  german here : jewish history is taught on three different occasion in history class . 
  jewish people in medieval europe . 
  ( about 45-90 minutes ) 2 . 
  in context of wwii and the holocaust . 
  ( extensively ) 3 . 
  modern jewish history . 
  foundation of israel , palestinian conflict ... ( in different subjects like history , geography ) also i guess in `` religion '' there are some themes regarding jewish history , but that 's not my m\u00e9tier ... 
  sadly there are not many meeting points with jewish culture anymore in germany . 
  we have a synagogue in our town and there is a radio broadcast every friday about jewish life and culture ( f.ex . 
  the time you have to light those candles ; ger : lichtz\u00fcndzeiten ) but that 's about it . 
  i think you have to distinguish between the view about jewish people and israeli politics . 
  while the jews as people are seen very positive ( espec .
