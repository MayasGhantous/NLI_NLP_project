  since i come from a very christian background ) , the politics are often criticized . 
  of course this is criticism between allies and there are only a hand full of people who want to leave israels side ... 
  you know what ? 
  i might just go to bed now ... , 
  chzech of course ... 
  those great western ~ ~ chechen ~ ~ czech towns like : - [ pilsen ] ( http://www.pilsen.eu/files/mestoplzen/web2013/turista/aktuality/2015/150209_doporuceny_program.jpg ) - [ eger/cheb ] ( http://www.ieger.com/images/egerfromcastle.jpg ) - [ marienbad / mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 l\u00e1zn\u011b ] ( https://www.reisenaktuell.com/.imaging/mte/atlas-theme/atlas-gallery/dam/hotels/eigenanreisen/g/goma-golf-hotel-morris/bilder/golf-hotel-morris-marienbad-bild1.jpg/jcr:content/golf-hotel-morris-marienbad-bild1.jpg ) - [ karlsbad/karlovy vary ] ( https://www.reisenaktuell.com/.imaging/mte/atlas-theme/atlas-gallery/dam/hotels/eigenanreisen/m/hotel-manes-capek-karlsbad-tschechien/bilder/hotel-manes-capek-karlsbad-tschechien-16698517.jpg/jcr:content/hotel-manes-capek-karlsbad-tschechien-16698517.jpg ) they are just beautiful , calm and ( for me ) easy to reach . 
  the food is great and not too expensive . 
  also there is [ asian dragon bazar ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/109005143.jpg ), 
  of course . 
  even if we have n't figured everything out just yet , it 's clear that humans made an impact on the climate . 
  what i 'm always a little skeptical about are the predictions of the consequences . 
  we can really only speculate ( well , interlligent guess ) what will happen , if we still do n't fully know how f.ex . 
  el nino works . 
  edit : interlligent guess . 
  i like it and keep it . 
   not only i believe in it , i believe that deniers should be punished like holocaust deniers . 
  i disagree on that . 
  but we would need better education and information about this subject ... 
  fu\u00dfball / football/soccer by far . 
  well , i would n't be offended at all . 
  but as soon as i realize that you do n't speak good german , i would switch to english , because that way the conversation would be much faster ... 
  it \u00b4 s actually pretty easy . 
  1 - very good - 15 points - 1 + 1 - very good - 14 points - 1 1 - very good - 13 points - 1 - 2 - good - 12 points - 2 + 2 - good - 11 points - 2 2 - good - 10 points - 2 - 3 - satisfying - 9 points - 3 + contiune ... 
  like this for most classes : 1 - very good 2 - good 3 - satisfying 4 - sufficient 5 - deficient 6 - insufficient if you 're on a gymnasium ( highest form of ii . 
  ed ) and in one of the two upper classes it 's presentet in points from 15 to 0 with 15-13 = very good 12-10 = good etc. 
  between sleeping and showering there are just my nerves working and my brain sleeping . 
  once a day in the morning . 
  ca n't wake up without a shower . 
  aside from ownership , i think it depends on the subreddit . 
  i consider this sub more of a european subreddit , while / r/de is more or less a german subreddit . 
  more popular subs like / r/askreddit are manly international subreddits with a ( very ) strong american influence . 
  well overall i live in a area ( franconia aka northern bavaria aka bavarian occupied territory ) with a [ water deficit ] ( http://www.dwd.de/dwd/klima/agrar/vd/vd_kwbq2.png ) . 
  meaning we use more water than comes in . 
  that 's especially a problem in summer . 
  because of that we build several big catchment lakes , known as the [ new franconian lakecountry ] ( http://www.unterschwaningen.de/images/touristik/panorama_bsee.jpg ) . 
  the picture shows only one of them . 
  this project was a big success with a stable water supply for the region during times of drought and a huge boost for the tourist and recreational industry . 
  aditionaly we build a canal connecting the two major rivers in germany ( do n't be mad ossies ) : the rhine ( via the main ) and the danube . 
  it 's called [ rhine-main-danube-channel ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000hilrljw5vqi/s/900/720/rhein-main-donau-kanal-lastkahn-mcg-20120709-056.jpg ) . 
  we are still waiting for the promised economical effects coming out of the new trad route , though ... 
  [ my results . 
  ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=86.6&amp;d=60.1&amp;g=53.8&amp;s=54.3 ) seems pretty good in comparison as i see myself . 
  i 'm not sure in what way the religious questions played a role ... 
  tagesschau is pretty good actually . 
  especially if you do n't have time during the day it 's a nice summary . 
  [ yesterday 's tagesschau ] ( https://youtu.be/dezyv8atbhu ), 
  ( = nut creme ) everybody just calls it nutella , regardless if it 's really nutella or some generic brand ... 
  a economic boycott of the us would crash the global market fast . 
  not to speak about the political consequences ... 
  here 's some tea . 
  do n't mind the glowing ... 
  well , i guess merkel is ok . she might be a bit passive ( which is a good thing sometimes ) , but all things considered we did pretty good during the economic crisis and the refugee crisis ( up to debate ; please do n't kill me ) . 
  she represents stability and you just know what to expect from her . 
  i also like her european policy . 
  adding to this we just do n't have any real alternative ... so ... 
  still . 
  even if you live in east austria you 'll get to munich for around 100 euro with the train ( rj ) . 
  adding the cost of the flight from munich to la ( 598 with air canada atm ) , you 'll end up with around 800/900 euros both ways . 
  i 'm not saying that 's viable for everybody , but it 's much cheaper than your calculation ... 
  not really . 
  flights are around 600 euro two ways to some airports in the west . 
  ( minneapolis , la , sf ... ) if you fly with wow-a you might even find something cheaper and have the opportunity to check out reykjavik ... edit : 481 $ frankfurt -  ny ; ny -  frankfurt with wow . 
  yea ... they are called `` reichsb\u00fcrger '' ( = citizen of the `` reich '' ) . 
  they were the center of media attention some weeks ago , after one of them shot a policeman . 
  now there are arrests , searchings ... 
  they argue that germany after 1936 is not lawful and that the german reich ist still in place . 
  also [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bdfiyvq.jpg ) is the best joke about them . 
  referring to the loose term `` reich '' , which could mean nazi-germany , the german kaiserreich , medieval germany or the roman empire . 
  while the former three are christian and `` germanic '' , the last one ( represented by the guy on the far right ) shouts in roman tradition : `` death to christians , down with the germans '', 
  depends . 
  we have no `` offical '' times .

  same for me . 
  a little bit of healthy european nationalism would n't be that bad ... 
  i really do n't mind small talk with people i interact often or want to be friends with . 
  ( although big talk ( ? ), 
  is better ... ) but i do n't like smalltalk with people i know i wo n't be friends with , because i will f.ex . 
  never see them again . 
  like meeting someone in an elevator during vacation . 
  smile , be friendly and say hello , but do n't pretend to care about me or that you will remember me after 5min . 
  also do n't make me pretend to care about you ... 
  yes . 
  but i only included the bigger groups of immigrants . 
  not as many . 
  at least in west germany . 
  but the few we have here would rank nr . 
  1 with the west europeans ... 
  rather negativ . 
  but not as bad as `` refugees '' and arabs in general . 
  and it got a lof worse in the last 10 years . 
  disclaimer : thats just an observation , not my oppinion . 
  edit : i guess it would go like this from ok/good rep to very bad rep. 1 italians , spaniards , french 2 polish , chzech 3 bulgarian , romanian ( and other east europeans ) 4 turkish 5 arabs/africans ( `` refugees '' ), 
  nestle . 
  fuck those guys !,
