  well , i do . 
  several refugee families live in my village and there are several school classes for refugees in the school i 'm working . 
  ( but i 'm not their teacher ... ) like with all people there are idiots and nice people . 
  but it 's great to see , that the children adapt really fast . 
  the classes are not really `` refugee classes '' but classes for all students who do n't speak proper german , so there are a lot of different backgrounds to be found . 
  ( mostly refugees , but also `` normal '' migrants ) on the other side many adults are n't willing to adapt the their new county , which causes problems on both sides of course . 
  beside the ususal ones ( das boot , der untergang , goodbye lenin ... ) i really like * [ the educators ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okbfwf0p0pm ) * [ generation war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmygpx23px4 ) * [ the red baron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovuu3b3s7m ) * [ vincent wants to sea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blr5t_hvk4i ) * [ der schuh des manitu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v5j4qhximq ) * [ the wave ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9vdfb2f-b0 ), 
  wei\u00dfbrot ( = white bread ) in german . 
  ( or toast ), 
  exploration and sail ships . 
  what i wanted to say is that there are a lot of people with a healthy patriotism in the younger generation ... 
  yes , of course . 
  here in germany it 's ( as you know ) difficult . 
  but the younger generation ( < 30yrs ) has a much healthier relationship to patriotism than older people . 
  i never really thought about that ... but i guess i 'll go with a mixture of risk-taking and minorities . 
  i think it was too long ago for noticing any effect on the `` character '' of any country . 
  source ? 
  [ someone call the norwegians !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elprzpniglg ), 
  yes , we have geography as a subject in germany . 
  and pupils do learn the states of the us , but for our daily life the states of the us do n't have too much relevance , so they are forgotten soon . 
  additional to that the focus in geography is not on learning countries , rivers or states , but comprehending coherences and developments . 
  some themes we teach related to the us : - the downfall of the us car industry - silicon valley and sansan - the model of the typical north american city and segregation - agriculture in the us - modern developments source : i 'm a geography teacher . 
  * urge to invest intensifies ... *, 
  i would also be happy about some towels . 
  east-germans are really bad . 
  they are either communists or nazis . 
  yea , that 's pretty bad in europe atm . 
  i always experience that going to the netherlands or suisse . 
  til . 
  i 'm sorry , not really . 
  ( english person speaking german ) cute accents would be french or spanish . 
  perhaps we hear english accents too often ? 
  why armenia ? 
  no , not at all . 
  i ca n't recall hearing from here outside of reddit/the internet . 
  i would go with latvia esp . 
  i 'm going on vacation very often , but i only got two stamps in my passport ... also last time i went per train to prague i missed the border , because it was not marked at all . 
  the thing is most people actually have a good opinion on the american people , while the us-government has a bad reputation since the wars in the middle east , all the torture scandals and the shit the cia/nsa does . 
  the problem with the election of trump ( and previously bush jr. ) is that it actually shows that a good part of the american people is in favor of additional wars and very undemocratic and non-peaceful policies . 
  but most people realize , that trump and his followers do n't represent all americans . 
  i never got this reaction . 
  normally you just add the district of the town where you are from if it 's a big city ( berlin , munich ... ) . 
  for example i would say ( district changed for all you crazy murderers out there ) : i 'm from munich gr\u00fcnwald . 
  [ map of the districts of munich ] ( https://www.rogers-immobilien.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/immobilienmakler-muenchen.jpg ) but german cities tend to be a lot smaller than us-cities area wise . 
  most people simply use cool . 
  but there are some word with partially a slightly different meaning . 
  some of them are n't used so often any more . 
  for digging sth . 
  - stark = strong - irre = crazy - geil ( see atlas_at 's post ), 
  german foot retailing 2015 according to [ statista ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/4916/umfrage/marktanteile-der-5-groessten-lebensmitteleinzelhaendler/ ) : 1 . 
  ** 25 % ** edeka-group ( tengelmann , edeka , comet , diska , netto , spar ... ) 2 . 
  ** 5 % ** metro-group ( real , kaufhof 6 . 
  i would recommend one or two nights in berlin . 
  pretty cool city , lots of stuff to see . 
  traveling in the city from the railstation is really easy . 
  if the weather is good you could rent a bike ( around 10e for one day ) and reach almost all sights easily ... 
  nowadays it 's often `` made in eu '' . 
  my favorite : `` made in eu and/or non-eu countries '', 
  well , of course !, 
  who wants to come home to a dirty house ? 
  i am the cleaner at my own house . 
  lol . 
  pretty cheap esp . 
  in comparison to nordic countries . 
  [ here ] ( http://static.giga.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lidl-prospekt-online-screenshot.jpg ) are some special offers from one of the most popular supermarkets ( lidl ) . 
  the special offers vary each day/week , but the normal prices are n't considerably higher ... 
  never been in the situation , but here are some cheap meals ... * pasta with sauce * sauerkraut with bread * potoes with heavy sour cream, 
  asian noodles or turkish ice cream ( bought on the asian side of istanbul of course ... ), 
  i realized how much `` culture '' we as the younger generation share over the internet . 
  i guess never before culture was so independent form national countries . 
  we have the same inside jokes , know the same music , watch the same movies ... 
  i think that will lead to a better understanding and more acceptance for cooperation in europe . 
  also i think japan . 
  ( getting the band back together , am i right italy ? ), 
  ok , this attitude is exactly the problem . 
  you 're not asking these questions to get answers , you 're attacking me . 
   the values of a muslim in france has more historical authenticity than their post-revolution antitheism . 
  well , no . 
  antitheims evolved during the early modern age from christianity . 
  islam on a larges scale is still very new to the most parts of europe . 
   that we are n't willing to abandon our faith in exchange for acceptance , and the thought of that is repellent to most people of any faith ? 
  well , no . 
  most people could n't care less about your faith . 
  but as soon as your faith is conflicting with human rights , common decency and , yes , also christian values there will be problems and you will be asked to change that if you want to live in a ( mostly ) christian-cultured county . 
   millions of muslims live in the west , for generations . 
  how are muslim values not a part of western values ? 
  millions of christians lived/live in oriental parts of the world , so why are christian values not part of islamic values ? 
  ( like human rights )  do you know what shar ` iah is ? 
  it is everything that governs a muslim 's life . 
  when i do n't have a beer , that is shar ` iah . 
  why is the practice of my faith not accepted ? 
  well , i give you that one . 
   i was referring to * some parts * of sharia law . 
  only our beer industry cares if you drink beer ...  how is their values less german than other german citizens . 
  because values are not defined solely by the people who live there right now , but also historically . 
   also , why should european values have `` less deeper '' roots ? 
  care to answer ? 
   how is a woman wearing modest clothing something you should have to accept or not ? 
  why do you feel entitled to see a muslim woman 's body ?
