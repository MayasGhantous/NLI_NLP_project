  as for ramadan , most children go to school aside from eid . 
  schools serve the population , so why should they have to choose between grades and god ? 
  why not both ? 
  because with a burkini and a burka you violate existing ( speaking from a german perspective ) laws . 
  and why should we change the laws we made for a good reason ? 
   you 've not given any examples of muslims asking to change anything , just non-muslims having offense at a woman not showing her body . 
  integration is following the law and speaking the language , the laws guarantee religious freedom . 
  i gave you two examples . 
  i will give you some more : * pork free meals in every school and federal building * islamic education in schools * building of mosques , thus changing the traditional skyline ( yes , that 's a thing ) * allowing the call to prayer of the muezzin so , i would like some examples how you think muslims should adapt to germany since i gave you 6 examples how germany actually adapts to muslims ... 
   islam is islam , the beauty of it is that no matter where you are it 's the same thing . 
  my religion is the exact same thing as someone from palestine or malaysia or morocco . 
  this is not true at all . 
  it 's like saying christianity is the same all over the world . 
  just look at the most prominent example which caused and continues to cause a lot of bloodshed : shia vs sunni . 
  well i will be brutally honest . 
  disclaimer : ** does that not make us and our belief systems and our values part of european culture and values as much as anyone else ? 
  ** european culture is in fact mostly influenced by christianity . 
  that ranges from traditions like holidays to lawmaking . 
  islam has other values , traditions etc. , so it is seen as foreign by most people . 
  ** why do people born in europe have to be told to integrate and `` reform '' their values to be more like values with less deeper roots than our own ? 
  ** see , that 's one of the problems . 
  muslim values sometimes collide with western values . 
  take for example sharia law , which is not accepted in europe . 
  many cultures have values similar or compatible to `` traditional protestant/catholic '' european values like orthodox or jewish values . 
  also , why should european values have `` less deeper '' roots ? 
  ** without asking us to change our religion , how can you accept us ? 
  ** i think the majority of people would accept islam ( and many of them already are ) if muslims are willing to `` do their part '' . 
  see , if you 're coming to a country ( and most of the muslims are new the european countries ; historically speaking ) and ask to be accepted , you ask the local population to change . 
  for example allowing burkinis , ramadan as school holiday etc. 
  so naturally we will ask from you to change too and we call that `` integration '' .

  what do you need ? 
  modern pop/rock ? 
  folk songs ? 
  i honestly ca n't think about a culture that would have real problems traveling europe ... 
  `` this video is not available in your country . '', 
  well , better call brussels ... 
  i would go with : [ alle meine entchen - probably the most known ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbt6edklnj4 ) [ h\u00e4nschen klein - ignore the strange video ... but i di n't want the new childversion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eozjgzr6qm0 ) [ hoch auf dem gelben wagen - sung by our former president ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yglo961zcf4 ) [ wir lagen vor madagaskar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkt6ykio3vs ) but i do n't think everyone could recall all the lyrics ... and nobody sings them at pubs . 
  i really like dr congo . 
  all those militant groups keep you pretty safe !, 
  yea ... me too . 
  and do n't have too much money on your bank accounts . 
  buy real stuff . 
   i think you should realise china is # 1 economically and growing i never denied that ...  one of the greenest nations ha , not by faaar . 
  they made progress , yes , but that 's merely a baby step . 
  i think you should step out of the reddit echochamber more ... 
  if we are sure they are our allies ... why not ? 
  the usa are here , too . 
  we could have a party . 
  let 's invite putin and the red army . 
  well we sort of have those in germany . 
  i 's called sozialkunde in gymnasium ( like grammar school ) . 
  i think the french one will be interesting . 
  german election will be pretty boring . 
  my 5c are on a `` big coalition '' between the cdu and spd with merkel as chancellor . 
  the only interesting aspect will be how many votes far right ( npd but mainly afd ) and far left ( die linke ) will get . 
  well i think in the long term it seems to become inevitable . 
  with automation becoming cheaper and cheaper , more jobs will be replaced by machines . 
  ( looking at you amazon ) . 
  yeah . 
  if you want something really traditional try a leonhardiritt . 
  it 's a blessing for the horses from st. leonhard . 
  all the local riding clubs dress up ( many in traditional dresses ) and ride to the church to get the blessing . 
  looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/leonhardiritt_iffeldorf_2012_80g.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://img.fotocommunity.com/leonhardiritt-7470115a-2e8b-4703-997b-0eafcfc55942.jpg?width=1000 ) . 
  yeah , lake festival it was !, 
  i lived in tegernsee for half a year . 
  i would love to go back there ... and yes , tegernseer beer is not the last of the reasons . 
  as a german i can suggest southern bavaria . 
  ( not munich or the other big cities ) . 
  go to tegernsee , especially during an event like kichweih or tegernsee in flammen ( in flames ) for some traditional dresses . 
  also perhaps schwarzwald area . 
  if you want party then berlin might be the thing for you . 
  not too expensive , cool people , a lot to see ( lots of cold war and wwii stuff ) . 
  nightlife around the clock . 
  you also have good train/plane connections and good hotels/hostels there . 
  or prague . 
  cheaper then berlin . 
  a lot of party and beautiful medieval old town . 
  or rome . 
  a lot of roman stuff ( very impressive ) to see . 
  cool atmosphere in the evening . 
  a bit touristy and i do n't really know about the nightlife there . 
  madrid should be cool , too . 
  but i never was there longer then a day . 
   high school we do n't really have a high school . 
  there is gymnasium which is more like junior high + high school so from age 11 to 17 . 
  the gymnasium is the hightest form of education . 
  you could also go to realschule and hauptschule , which are a bit shorter and easier . 
  i 'm teaching at a gymnasium , so i 'll concentrate on that . 
   your division sounds great . 
  our system is divided in : - economical route ( with accounting , a lot of economics , informatics ... ) - social-science route - scientific , technical route ( a lot of chemistry and physics ) - linugistic/humanistic route ( a litte bit old fashioned . 
  a lot of greec and latin . ), 
  - musical route ( art and music ) also you can always choose between different `` third '' languages ( beside german and english ) like russian , french , latin , spanish , greek ... 
  that 's a bit general . 
  what do you want so see ? 
  nature , cities ? 
  what countries are you interested in ?
