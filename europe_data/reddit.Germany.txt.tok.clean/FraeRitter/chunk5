  what 's you budget ? 
  where do you want to stay ? 
  if you want to go cheap , you could go to czechia ( espec . 
  prague ) , poland or the baltics ( espec . 
  ria , tallin ) . 
  if you want to have a bit of an adventure you could get a eurorail ticket and travel across europe per train . 
  ( did this last winter in italy ; it 's great if you do n't need a shower every day ) . 
  not at the moment . 
  we have many ( many ) changes going on and need to let it settle for a bit . 
  what i would change : - more teachers -  smaller classes . 
  atm classes are between 25 and 33 pupils . 
  would make everything easier . 
  - less grading . 
  grade are fine and important , but they should not be the main reason to teach . 
  - more teacher-parent interaction . 
  this one is important . 
  often we have pupils in like the 9th grade with severe problems ( grades and social ) and nobody has ever talked to the parents .

  i guess [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/8ckzmxy ) from last summer . 
  you can see the church in the background . 
  what do you mean `` gag '' ? 
  you are one of them , are you ? 
  nice . 
  an opportunity to practice my english speaking skills !, 
  not at all . 
  almost all people i personally talk to think free movement is one of the major advantages of the eu ... 
  no , not really . 
  yea , like a mini series ( 3 x 90 minutes ) . 
  it 's pretty well made , comparable to band of brothers . 
  i would go with * [ das boot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq15q5xkkxu ) * [ the downfall ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp1rxmm1-60 ) * [ stalingrad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6thqksnbso ) * [ the baader menhof complex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fanvi8-zlsa ) and for fans of wwii series like band of brothers/pacific : [ generation war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmygpx23px4 ), 
  [ there is ... ] ( http://centralstation.ru/ ) but you ca n't take a train there ... nsfw ? 
  start in paris . 
  go east . 
  ask every 50 km if you 're there . 
  if no : go further east . 
  if yes : success !, 
  now you 're near moskow central station and you can take the train back to paris . 
  for me it 's [ die moldau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtkshwqair4 ) by smetana or [ donauwellen walzer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht30hqwxoxa ) by ivanovici . 
  but there is also bach , chopin , h\u00e4ndel , mozert , beethoven , hayden , mendelsson , mahler , wagner ... and now enjoy some of germany 's best music : [ fichtels lied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp9wp6qvbsk ) [ knorkator - buchstabe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucstyd2t7m ) [ jbo - bimber bumber d\u00f6del dei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twg2g6ybxm4 ), 
  i thought so .

  ] ( https://youtu.be/pruy1ikilcy?t=84 ), 
  you know we germans would never do such things ... 
  not at all . 
  but another revolution would probably `` cure '' political apathy . 
  ok , so what 's your point in this `` argument '' ? 
  sure . 
  do you usually eat deer and rabbit ? 
  well , a bird with my motorcycle once ... but i thought he was referring to kill an animal for food . 
  ( `` have you ever killed an animal that you usually eat ? '' ), 
  so i would n't count driving over mice either ... 
  born and raised in the country , working in a city now ... 
  oh man , i love friedman . 
  preditictions for the future ( from 2009 ) : * 2010s the conflict between islamic powers and the us will die down * 2020s russia and china collapse * new eurasian powers ( beside us ) : poland , japan and turkey * ca . 
  2050 wwiii with us , `` polisch block '' , uk , india , china vs. turkey and japan * the war will be up to 3 years and fought on earth and the moon . 
  * us wins * polish block tries to take over europe/asia * us allies with britain and turkey against poland * 2070s conflicts between us and mexiko over immigration he should have labeled his books sci-fi ... 
  not really no . 
  i 'm a teacher in germany , so that 's kind of my hobbyhorse . 
  first of : the school system in germany is different from `` land '' to `` land '' . 
  meaning that bavaria ( where i 'm from ) has a different school system than baden-w\u00fcrttenberg . 
  of course there are some regulations for all `` l\u00e4nder '' . 
  i think the bavarian school system is not that bad , but there are two mayor problems : first the division into three `` sectors '' . 
  while all pupils go to a `` grundschule '' from 6 to 10 years , they get divided into three ( or four if you count mentally challenged schools ) sections : gesamtschule , realschule and gymnasium . 
  [ it 's complicated ] ( https://www.schulberatung.bayern.de/imperia/md/content/schulberatung/pdfschw/pdfsw09102/schulsystem_bayern__bersicht_09.jpg ) and i think that is one of the main problems . 
  the decision which school the 10-year-old should go will shape the rest of his life . 
  but it 's far , far too early to decide . 
  ( of course there are some possibilities to change the type of school , but it 's always difficult . ), 
  the second problem would be funding . 
  we desperatly need teacher in all types of school , but we never ( ever ) get enough money . 
  so , what do we do ? 
  make classes bigger ( up to 33 pupils ) . 
  make teachers work longer . 
  with that the individual care for the upils tend to go to zero . 
  f.ex with my subjects , you have only 2 hours ( a 45 min ) per class per week . 
  meaning with total 27 hours/week ( the rest is time for preparation etc. ), 
  i have 14 classes ( one of them only 45 min per week ) . 
  with around 30 pupils each , i have 420 pupils . 
  no way i even know all the names till the end of the year ... other than that i think the system works fine . 
  we had recently a rethinking from plain learning facts to learning how things are done ( how to understand a text , how to reach statistics ... ) . 
  serious question : do you consider yourself eastern european , southern european , a `` balkan state '' or something else ? 
  i always thought it was impressive that you guys managed to have the first socialist and islamic republic . 
  beside the usual `` germans are all nazis '' , that all germans are the same . 
  there are actually a ton of different regional traditions , languages and cultures . 
  you could argue , that a bavarian is closer `` cultural related '' to an austrian than to a german from hamburg . 
  netherlands ? 
  i 'm not really a rap/hip-hip fan ^ ^ ^ ^ ( metaaaal ^ ^ ^ foreverrr ) , so my perception may be a bit flawed ... rap got popular in germany in the 90th with a lot pf bands , who were influenced by american artists like [ stieber twins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kmdpklvdza ) . 
  after that it basically divided in two subgenres . 
  on the one side `` stra\u00dfenrap '' ( rap from the streets ) and on the other side so called `` deutschrap '' ( german rap ) . 
  stra\u00dfenrap basically addresses all the bad living conditions in the suburbs . 
  a good example is [ sido - mein block ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uktohlveya ) . 
  deutschrap means a lot more fun , a lot more puns and a lot more storytelling . 
  it 's also more mainstream . 
  examples for fun song could be [ fettes brot - emanuela ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rigxc8putts ) but there are also serious issues like in [ von der liebe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er8bccgvpws ) . 
  beside theses two there are a lot of artist with a deep message . 
  ( can you call that a third subgenre ? ), 
  see [ antilopen gang ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsgh9h5ywig ) or [ main concept ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmikxtdzkri ) . 
  also there are some pop-rap artists . 
  just for fun : [ die atzen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txbbnkah7qm ) < -- that normally plays after 2 am [ fantastischen vier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuv3kvnvt-w ),
