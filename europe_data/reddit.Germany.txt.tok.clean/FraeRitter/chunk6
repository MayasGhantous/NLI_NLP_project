  i do n't think it 's only a issue regarding meat . 
  the same goes for harvesting grain , fruit , vegetables or milking a cow . 
  it 's just part of the global differentiation of labor . 
  but i have to agree with you . 
  i think if everybody had to kill his own animals , there would be much more vegetarians ... 
  manly pig and chicken . 
  idk , i just quoted you . 
  but i guess that are some of the most discussed aspects in all western countries ( and others probable , too ) . 
  healthcare , guns , police , race well , it seems you already have a pretty good list in your head ... 
  ^ we ^ neither now i get it . 
  take [ this ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/rezepte/83/83818/764124-960x720-fraenkisches-schaeufele.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://bilder.t-online.de/b/47/02/86/50/id_47028650/tid_da//index.jpg ) as appology for not getting it earlier ... , 
  is this some sort of weird slovenian humor i do n't get ? 
  there is more than one germany ? 
  oh , so everyone in europe is practically some kind of a german ? 
  huh ? 
  are you serious ? 
  can you read ? 
  i said quite the opposite ... 
  i do n't want a heated internet argument , but can you explain me what you mean with `` opium of the masses '' in this context . 
  i know what it meant when marx said it . 
  but what does it mean in the context of a modern european country and for ( upper ) middle class people like most of us ... ps . 
  [ i 'm a firm believer ( lutheran ) .

  but there is always / r/christianity or any other christian sub ... 
  are there seriously people doing that ? 
  i mean not in a funny way . 
  ( swamp germans blabla ... ), 
  so if i bring my own it 's ok ? 
  i lived all my life in an area with many us soldiers . 
  ( near katterbach airbase ) there was never any serious complaints . 
  but there are two minor points : 1 ) noise i ' t an helicopter base ( and rockets i guess ) . 
  training and restationing ( ? ), 
  are causing a lot of noice over populated areas . 
  but there is an hotline for germans to complain and some rules between the local politicians and the us base regarding flying times and areas ( f.ex . 
  not over villages/cities ) . 
  2 ) us-soldiers us soldiers tend to go heavy partying when there 's a local `` fest '' ( think oktoberfest bus small ) . 
  they get really really drunk and start fights . 
  sometimes the mp comes and breaks things up . 
  there are also some people who are against a us base in the region at all out of political reasons . 
  but most germans ( at least here ) think having the us base is a positive factor for the region . 
  it 's also tons of fun partying with us soldiers ... , 
  hey . 
  i went on a 10 day roadtrip from la to las vegas . 
  we went hiking for a few days in yosemite , visited death valley np and grand canyon . 
  first of all i think it was fucking great . 
  i really enjoyed the shitload of space you have . 
  it 's incedible . 
  you can drive for like 2 hours and not see a singles village . 
  ( i 'm from southern germany ; perhaps other europeans have the same amount of space ( looking at you finland ) ) . 
  at the same time that means there is a shitload of nothingness . 
  another thing were motels . 
  we had n't booked any hotels along the way and went mostly to motels we found along the route . 
  it 's fantastic how clean , cheap and big those rooms are . 
  ( also american breakfast ; basically dessert ) . 
  one of the most positive things were the people . 
  regardless if you 're at trader joes in la , dollartree ( ? ), 
  somewhere near yosemite or at a hotel , fucking all people were nice and friendly . 
  and so open . 
  not in my life a fellow franconian/bavarian/german started a conversation in an elevator . 
  i did n't even know how to react !, 
  another thing i remember are prices for groceries . 
  while all things made of plastic were incredible cheap ( like cups ) , meat and bread was really , really expensive . 
  perhaps that 's a regional thing ... all in all i really loved the visit . 
  will go again next summer . 
  what city ? 
  yea . 
  went there a few years ago for a week . 
  one of my best city trips ever . 
  beautiful city , friendly people and great food . 
  prices are relatively cheap . 
  i 'm really happy i went there , because atm i would n't go there . 
  i would either go with [ wir sind helden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55smhowylla ) or [ annenmaykantereit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txzmfufrjfo ) . 
  can be as obscure and unknown as you want !, 
  as a german i think i would move to austria . 
  but that feels like cheating , so i choose czechia , because it 's fucking beautiful and the people are really nice . 
  * you have absolute power . 
  * laws are made for all european countries without delay . 
  * passed laws will stay in effect . 
  i saw [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/697dnt/england_vs_greece_weather_reporting/ ) post on / r/videos a few minutes ago and thought a few more examples would n't hurt . 
  nice flair . 
  [ franconian high-five !,

  [ calm down , boy ... ] ( http://www.exberliner.com/downloads/8749/download/bitblt-620x420-ba2f12d6ea9bf0239925cf265eba3e5e09660c71/768px-angela_merkel_10.jpg ), 
  where you frozen in time for the last 65 years ? 
  this is the first time i see another franconian here ... 
  well , we germans are n't so productive when it comes to jokes , so we have to recycle them ... 
  if you do n't want it anymore , we will take it . 
  with best regards , germany, 
  ** europe ** - [ it 's hot . 
  the good ol' times ... 
  if an irish , spanish or cypriote bank goes bankrupt , their papers ( f.exp . 
  bonds ) , which are hold by your bank , will be worthless . 
  so your bank will go bankrupt , too . 
  and their papers will be worthless . 
  which causes my bank to go bankrupt . 
  ( same goes with states , that 's why we need smp ! ),
