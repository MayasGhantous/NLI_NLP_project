  yea i know . 
  i feel guilty ... 
  but i thought i limit the soap operas and children shows to one of each . 
  yea that , too !, 
  there are many german soap operas ... 
  i tried to reduce it to one . 
   ( i do n't know who would downvote you for this ... ),

  shhhhhh !, 
  do n't give them more ideas !, 
  so , how exactly can we support a nation which abducts our citizens ? 
  holy shit !,

  [ taken two days ago . 
  3/10 low effort, 
  man , that 's a great idea ... i will watch this thread closely . 
  cool . 
  the best scenario would be a small ( ish ) town at the beach i guess . 
  doing some city stuff in the evening and heading out of town for a day or so . 
  do you think thats possible with public transportation or better a rental car ? 
  hey , i 'm planning a vacation for 4 days in the week before easter and i 'm strongy considering portugal . 
  any recommendations for some nice , calm places which are in range of an airport ? 
  to war with n\u00fcrnberg !, 
  down with the buggraf !,

  fake news stories that the footage is fake . 
  everyone beliefs it , because the last footage was fake , too .

  hmmm ... 
  i like it . 
  well , thank god i do n't have a polish flair ...  it 's [ franconian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=22&amp;v=huoutmtmzlk ) . 
  so we divided the uk between the eu members and these are the flags of the occupied zones ? 
  is that the thing therese will bring to the brexit negotiations ? 
  did it with two of my friends , so a fairly small group . 
  safety was never a problem , but we had some nights on lonely train station . 
  ( last train arriving 3am ; next one leaving at 7am ) as long as you ' r not feeling uneasy being alone at night in a empty train , i would say both is possible . 
  i for myself really like to travel alone lately , so i would recommend that !, 
  it is !, 
  get an [ interrail ticket ! ], 
  ( http://www.interrail.eu/de/interrailpaesse/global-pass ) . 
  or eurorail . 
  you can choose limited passes ( countries ) or global passes . 
  all countries in europe you want !, 
  i did it last year in italy . 
  just hop on a train and see how long you want to stay on it and where you end up !, 
  i can not recommend that enough !,

  * even so , the figure of $ 100,000,000,000 might feel infuriatingly arbitrary to many taxpayers . 
  to be fair , the ft has expressed its new estimate as a range between `` $ 91bn - $ 113bn , depending on how britain 's share is calculated '' . 
  the latest range from breugel , an economic thinktank based in brussels , runs from anywhere from $ 86bn to $ 113bn . 
  * [ source ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/03/what-do-we-know-about-britains-brexit-divorce-bill ), 
  your government signed all budget plans , so yes . 
  i think you committed to these payments . 
  the analogy is a bit wrong . 
  inagine it like this : you agree to a five year contract with your provider . 
  after two years ( numbers totally random ) you decide you do n't want to use your phone anymore at all because of reasons . 
  sill your provider demands the payment . 
  at least it 's not him who wants you out ( in contrary , he would love to keep you as a customer ) . 
  seems fair to me . 
  why the fuck do they always call it a `` divorce bill '' ?? 
  the uk commited to these payments and there should be no question at all to pay them !, 
  hmmm ... being called polish is bettern than being called bavarian . 
  it 's a step in the right direction !, 
  but the flair is franconian .
