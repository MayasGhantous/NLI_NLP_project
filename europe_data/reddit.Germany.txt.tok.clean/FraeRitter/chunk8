  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ bet ^ ^ ^ ^ oyur ^ ^ ^ ^ morther ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ nice ^ ^ ^ ^ lady ... 
  hahaha ... she is so dumb , i do n't understand a word she said !, 
  * i think more efforts are needed * i agree . 
  eh ... reddit is no public space . 
  there are most certainly a ton of right winged websites out there ... 
  * a network of far-right , often english-speaking activists has established a foothold in the german online space via reddit , using it to push messages which support the anti-immigrant alternative f\u00fcr deutschland ( afd ) party . 
  * * while its following is small , the network represents a possible insertion point for fake news and disinformation into the german public discourse just months before the country 's election , in which chancellor angela merkel 's policy on immigration and refugees is one of the most sensitive topics . 
  * with 200 subscribers right now ... 
  in other news : - 400 subs for people who like / r/christianhardcore - 150000 subs for / r/catsstandingup - 23000 people liking / r/monkslookingatbeer - 51000 terrorists on / r/greendawn - 10000 meteldetectorists on / r/metaldetecting - 56000 people think we need more blood for armok and cats are a reliable food source on / r/dwarffortress the afd subreddit so so unimportant it could be a facebook page ... how the fuck should it influence the german news ? 
  most germans do n't even know about reddit at all !, 
  driving a sandero . 
  pretty great . 
  got like 70.000 km on it and no problems at all . 
  to be clear : it has not to most modern interior , but it only costs around 16.000 e new ( most ugraded version ) . 
  it has a lot of space , so i can fit my bike or go on vacation with it . 
  also the increased floor clearance is useful if you plan to drive some light off road . 
  keep in mind it is no all-wheel ( ? 
  buuuuut german were realllly good at building things to `` concentrate '' ... 
  seriously ? 
  the left one seems much better to concentrate . 
  hmmm ... last products : pharma - gelomyrthol by pohl-boskamp plane - wow airlines/airbus food - knorr clothes - cant remember . 
  most certainly made in asia . 
  uses glossnass and gps netflix/hbo/hollywood - nope , nope , got me there american books - normally british or russian . 
  this time mcfarlane . 
  `` aside from it serviced and products '' videogames - everything from paradox . 
  also anno . 
  i do n't say i do n't relay on american products . 
  but i guess not as heavy as you may think ... 
  aside from it services . 
  try reading the post first ... 
  i know ... 
  made in america products . 
  but yes , my bathroom is stuffed with colgage-palmolive ... , 
  nope . 
  the last movies i went to : 3096 and serial ( bad ) weddings ) . 
  both like 3 years ago . 
  honestly , aside from it services and products , i do n't know when i bought american products the last time ... perhaps gas/oil ? 
   why , then , do confident germans increasingly dislike the united states ? 
  it is complicated . 
  perhaps fabricated reasons for war , unjustified wars or violation of human rights ? 
  or spying on allies ? 
   germans apparently do not appreciate that fellow nato member america still subsidizes their defense . 
  nor do they seem appreciative of their huge trade surplus ( $ 65 billion ) with the united states . 
   where is the fucking source to that ? 
   yet being guilt-ridden does not equate to being humble ( never a german strong suit ) . 
  stereotypes ? 
  nice . 
   in international finance , germany de facto runs the european union on a mercantile system . 
  come on ...  berlin often virtue-signals the world how morally superior it now is , while also searching for ways to import cheap labor . 
  one result is german chancellor angela merkel 's disastrous open-door policy of welcoming in millions of unvetted immigrants from the war-ravaged middle east at a time of heightened worries over jihadist terrorism . 
  so merkel did all that for cheap labor ? 
  good to know . 
  never mind the costs for all that ...  but it is quieter about shirking its nato membership requirements for defense spending to free up cash for its own citizens -- and making mega-profits from exporting pricey luxury cars to a hyper-capitalist american elite . 
  oh , never mind we are actually increasing the defense spending . 
   instead , many of them believe that whenever germany sticks to worrying only about germany , the world is a far safer place -- both now and in the past . 
  shitty conclusion to a shitty article . 
  2/10 with rice . 
  you 're shining in the night , for breakfast , till war . 
  yup . 
  sounds like rammstein . 
  there are actually forbidden ones ... like ss , kz , hj , ns . 
  hh means hansestadt hamburg , which is much older than national socialism . 
  ^ ^ please ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ask ^ ^ where ^ ^ it ^ ^ came ^ ^ from . 
  that 's what i wrote ... 
  * polish police !, 
  but maybe a wolf , too ... 
  german : ich bin allergisch gegen gluten , milchprodukte ( = products made from milk ) und eier . 
  molkerei is the milk processing building ... , 
  hmmm ... 
  this looks like some kind of storage room . 
  any idea what school this is ? 
  interesting fact : 2009 a swedish neo nazi hired some polish helpers and had them cut the sign in three parts and stole it . 
  polish polish got them a few days later . 
  nor there 's a copy at the gate . 
  also the similar sign of the kz dachau was stolen 2014 and was found again in norway two years later ... 
  well i thought maybe we could stick to the geographical theme . 
  like call it after some mountains or valleys ... 
  so ... do the `` normal people '' like the new shortened version ? 
  so ... we are naming our ships after : - states ... ok - cities ( i espec . 
  like sulzbach-rosenberg ) ... alright - lakes ... k - rives ... hmmm - low mountain ranges ... um - types of fish ... wat ? 
  well , that would be 90e left . 
  one beer ( 1l ) at oktoberfest is around 10,50 e. 
  add something to eat , a tradition chicken dish f.ex . 
  and add 10e . 
  then the public transport in munich is pretty expensive . 
  for a day ticket it 's between 6 and 12e , depending where you want to go . 
  i think it 's doable . 
  i would recommend to buy some cheaper food a few steps away from oktoberfest . 
  even if you only go like 500m everything gets much much cheaper .

  [ berlin july 1945 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5i9k7s9x_a ) [ and something more hopeful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v66cr41dnnm ) - day after day when i 'm walking through these street i see how the ruins of this town get resurrected to houses . 
  but many windows stay empty , for many there was no return . 
  and about what was not long ago , one rather does n't speak about at all .
