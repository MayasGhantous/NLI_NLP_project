  but i ask myself who we are : we are who we are ; and we 're standing here ; divided , defeated , but in the end we 're still alive . 
  that ca n't possibly be it ; no time to be sad . 
  love you too france !, 
  signed germany . 
  tax breaks for hotels !, 
  please no fdp . 
  lot 's of lakes . 
  lot 's of trees . 
  lot 's of metal . 
  well , only denmark and the uk have the opt out rule for the maastrich treaty . 
  i guess it 's a good thing to finally enforce some treaty all have agreed on . 
  as a german : hahahhhahahahahhhahahhaaaaaaaaaa ^ aaaaa ^ aaaaa ^ aaaaa ^ aaa, 
  political economics ( also called national economics , `` economical state science '' , or social economics , short vwl ) is a part of economics . 
  i translated it really literal , though ... 
  i really like how we one the one side control and influence the entire eu and on the other side have no determination , plan or drive at all . 
  well , it says that there was a phase of `` pogroms and first mass - deportations from 1938-1941 '' . 
  knowing that some of the first deportations were to lublin in 1939 , the wording seems not perfect , but correct . 
  see [ plan nisko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lublin_reservation ), 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you want to say . 
  the nazis built concentration and death in the area which was poland before 1939 . 
  of course it was not poland during the soviet and german occupation . 
  most of the sites are on polish soil now . 
  so ... what 's the problem exactly ? 
  [ see this map .

  that 's only one of several books used for the oberstufe . 
  it 's up to the editors of the book what to write and the schools have no influence on that . 
  although the teacher can always choose not to work with the book ... 2 . 
  additional that is not by any means the first time pupils are confronted with the subject , so they already know that there were no camp run by polish people , but camps on polish ground . 
  the holocaust is taught several times in different subjects by different teachers . 
  i know the term polish camp has a bad connotation , but it could also mean `` camps on polish soil '' . 
  if you would suggest that the kzs were run by polish people you would be fired faster than you could say `` stalingrad '' .

  ah , got it . 
  ( but why are norway and switzerland in the picture then ... ), 
  hmmm ... am i missing something ? 
  i 'm really exited what shit they make up/dig out about the afd , merkel etc. 
  during the upcoming german election ... 
  it 's fun to watch . 
  all the weird songs and presentations . 
  also the opportunity to look down at other european countries , which is always good , right ? 
  question on the side : are there any good multi day hikes along the coast of croatia ? 
  and is it possible at all ( finding a campground , hostel ... ) ? 
   retarded party  liberals which i voted for, 
  it 's really well made and funny , but also it 's true to it 's name .

  hmmm, 
  holy shit . 
  stop talking simultaneously !, 
  you can say what you want about merkel and her government , but the situation is rather good over here . 
  i even got a raise and i 'm a teacher ... ( or i should rather thank seehofer for that ), 
  biggest thread to the eu atm . 
  not a fan . 
  i 'm really sure this post violates a rule of reddit or / de ... 
  tony hawks went to play play tennis there and wrote a book about it . 
  only thing i remember is , that manhole covers get stolen a lot ... 
  please no fdp ... pleeeaaase, 
  sooooo ... europe is basically a demigod then . 
  yeah ... the train may be a schulz train , but the rail network is owned by merkel . 
  congrats from your neighbor !, 
  coal and steel . 
  europe 's foundation . 
  ok . you seriously compare lending money with some controls to greece with things like the reichskristallnacht or even the holocaust ? 
  it 's a totally different issue , time , setting and mindset . 
  edit : also it seems to be true .

  regarding the german flag : the one you told is the most common theory . 
  when the german states fought against the napoleonic troops , they lacked a consisted uniform . 
  so they painted the coats black ( black covers all colours ) with red rims and golden knobs . 
  during the befreiungskriege against the french the colours got a meaning : black - aus dem dunkeln der knechtschaft ( from the darkness of servitude ) red - durch blutige schlachten ( through bloody battles ) gold - zum goldenen licht der freiheit ( to the golden light of freedom . ),

  only if we call it : `` bayern-franken '' [ but it would be fun i guess ... ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/img/55/5564976/o_1000_680_680_2012-02-22t122810z-01-mda10-rtrmdnp-3-germany.jpg4685455669543242957.jpg ), 
  actually this pic is from an article about the dangers of wind turbins for eagles . 
  perhaps this will raise the prices for coal , so we could stop subsidise the ruhrgebiet ?

  pfff , these days we concentrate more on buying countries than invading countries ... btw i heard you need a loan ? 
  and we formed a new union with italy like in the good times of the hre ... 
  yes , he is a pirate himself . 
  yay , if you hate bavarians , you are always welcome in franconia !, 
   not that they only treat us like idiots and concentrate all the investments in the south ( munich etc. 
  ) , no [ they forbid a few yeas ago to raise the franconian flag on the castle in n\u00fcrnberg !, 
  but we never wanted to be independent from germany , only from bavaria . 
  we would be very happy to have or own bundesland or at least have bayern renamed to franken-bayern or bayern-franken . 
  in fact there is a ( small but growing ) movement trying to push this through . 
  ok , as a franconian i understand your problems with `` we '' . 
  i was referring to the `` deutscher bund '' . 
  do you really want to return to denmark ? 
  you are only mad that we took schleswig-holstein/lauenburg from you 1864 ... , 
  i 'm franconian . 
  ( mittelfranken ) so i 'm somewhere in between , but within germany we normally like prussians and swabians more than bavarians . 
  i should have mentioned , that i 'm from the south . 
  i think it really depends where you live ... it would be interesting to know if sb .
