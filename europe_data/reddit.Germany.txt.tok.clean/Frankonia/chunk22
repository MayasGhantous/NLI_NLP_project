  we are n't allowed to operate them . 
  we have 670 soldiers in mali . 
  better inform your self before you talk . 
  you are going too far . 
  stop acting like an asshole . 
  zeldzaam is just trolling us and your reaction is quite shameful . 
  dude , fuck you . 
  that 's no way to act . 
  you 're a shame for our country . 
  that 's the most stupid thing i have read in the last 22 hours . 
  where ? 
  in kosovo , afghanistan and mali we deployed troops before you . 
  the only mission where we are reluctant is the bombing campaign against daesh in syria . 
  now stop behaving like a small child . 
  funny that you say that because the pan-europa movement is the strongest in bavaria out of all german states . 
  i 'm from rural bavaria and i still have a eu patriotism and i am not alone . 
  not even 1 % of their army . 
  are n't your tanks anyway . 
  you only leased them and they are still under german command . 
  no you 're not . 
  we have 4 times as many men deployed on international missions as you . 
  in afghanistan alone we deploy more men than you internationally . 
  and what is your special equipment ? 
  your tanks are leased from us and your navy is only halfway capable because you combine your forces with other countries . 
  bavaria is nice during ~ ~ this time of the year ~ ~ the entire year . 
  hope you like alcohol . 
  forgett it . 
  vdl is a blindg\u00e4nger . 
  well , first of it was a campaign by minister von der leyen to appear tough . 
  the [ lithuanian army did their own study and found no flaws with the g36 . 
  ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/03/30/lithuania-resumes-buying-g36s-finds-no-flaw-guns/ ) [ heckler & koch did their own tests did n't find any problems either . 
  ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/55456/germany-s-g36-cleared-by-trio-of-studies ) [ the internal questioning done by the bundeswehr found out that the soldiers them self did n't notice any of the flaws von der leyens study showed . 
  ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article147618281/warum-soldaten-das-g36-schaetzen.html ) [ additionally hk is taking the minsitry of defence to court ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/06/03/breaking-heckler-koch-takes-german-government-court-g36-accuracy-question/ ) [ and is likely to win . 
  ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/sturmgewehr-141.html ) [ another report by the ministry of defence shows that problems that were noticed with the g36 in the field came from faulty ammunition ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/06/30/hk-g36-rifle-faulty-bad-ammunition-caused-poor-accuracy/ ) [ the lithuanian army which uses the g36 too took a look at the vdls study and found out that the tests that were done on the g36 were configurated for an lmg . 
  ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/03/30/lithuania-resumes-buying-g36s-finds-no-flaw-guns/ ) to sum it up : vdl wanted to appear tough and made stupid decisions which led to her denouncing the g36 based on a flawed study , which the media that has a hate boner for the german defence industry jumped on willingly . 
  could people stop parroting this `` faulty rifles '' thing ? 
  that was a deliberate disinformation campaign that has been disproven times and again . 
  and the helicopters are n't exclusively a german problem considering that britain and sweden have the same problems with the same models , but do n't have as much red tape . 
  `` good to see that merkel has guts '' ? 
  and on because of equipment and number of soldiers . 
  well , there were revanchist groups but they were n't focusing on france . 
  what helped most was that while france was on the side of the winners it was n't considered much of a winner . 
  their leaders were n't present at teheran or potsdam . 
  they did n't get much spoils of war like poland or the soviets and they were n't ideological . 
  france was occupied from 1940 until 1944 . 
  in this timeframe many french people came into contact with german soldiers and many german civilians came into contact with french pows . 
  petainist propaganda during the war was a factor too . 
  funding is n't even the main problem ( it is a problem , but not the biggest ) . 
  the main problem are stupid policies and orders from our current and minister of defense and her predecessors . 
  were n't some german generals and admirals sentenced for supporting a war of aggression ? 
  not really his fault . 
  the man apparently lacked charisma and was a compromised solution after adenauer was forced to go . 
  seen the documentary , but those were just a few thousand ( mostly germans ) who were recruited out of pow camps . 
  more than enough . 
  try one of the university clinics ( berlin , erlangen , m\u00fcnchen ), 
  depends on what kind of scientists . 
  no , sadly most people listen to rap ... 
  it 's not as if we did n't have that before . 
  where do you think most of the foreign ss volunteers went after the war ? 
  if it were good heavy metal i would n't say something , but it 's the medicore stuff with which those teens want to become the next manowar . 
  are we watching the same zdf were klaus kleber constantly bashes the eu for not helping refugees and for being too neoliberal ? 
  balts welcome , except if they are musicians . 
  too many estonian wannabe rockers here ... 
  that 's because we had a austrian leadership ... 
  do n't ask the bfv questions . 
  bad things happen to people who ask questions . 
  yes and yes . 
  is n't it 1 in 10 female refugees ? 
  only roughly 45 % of the 1 million is female so it would be 45.000 refugees that are pregnant . 
  and considering that refugees are n't included in the statistics , they are irrelevant in this discussion . 
  oh okay , but most italians , greeks and southern european are basically assimilated . 
  we have a lot of first generation italian csu members . 
  the yugos tend to be rather green or socialdemocrat supporters . 
  even turks are probably better integrated in bavaria than in the other federal states . 
  no , that would be a danskaway, 
  they start stupid inquiries about chemtrails and the american occupation of germany . 
  their mps are missing during sessions and votes , they called the vice president of the parliament a provocation because she has a migration background . 
  and a lot of other stupid stuff . 
  but they are criminals !, 
  they steel our jobs !, 
  just last week two a policemen were beaten to the hospital by a group of brits . 
  pegada now !, 
  not that many , especially not those that arrived over the last year . 
  it 's basically impossible for the `` refugees '' to have german citizenship , thus they are not included . 
  besides that bavaria gives more money to families than other states . 
  the highest birth rates are usually in eastern germany and bavarian . 
  for eastern germany it is a 100 % save to say that it most likely has nothing to do with migrants . 
  in bavaria it 's harder to tell but according to the csu paper i read it 's mostly due to german citizens . 
  please do n't . 
  we already have enough badly integrated immigrants . 
  eu citizens should get preferential treatment over thosr, 
  because i kind of stalked the profiles of the 5 most frequent poster on there and they are americans . 
  at least they claim so . 
  the funny thing is , that most of them are r/the _ donald subscribers . 
  this is n't about trading . 
  this is about letting german troops operate from their territory , giving them intelligence on allied troop movements and giving them strategic ressources in a program similar to lend lease . 
  after all , sweden did n't allow german troops to operate from its territory or provided it with intelligence . 
   so does this make poland responsible for wwii ? 
  i know i am going to get downvoted to hell , but yes . 
  not for the reasons you listed though .
