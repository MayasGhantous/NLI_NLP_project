  the swiss model would be better for a united europe in my opinion . 
  i do n't know . 
  we simply have more in common than for example people from the ruhr . 
  i think you quoted the wrong post ... 
  funny , i am bavarian and i feel more related to dutchmen than to people from nrw ... 
  that 's all things we can and probably will change over the next years . 
  no , he is talking about le camp des saints . 
  120 days of sodom is by an italian i believe and has nothing to do with migration . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_boer_war the first documented use of concentration camps . 
  hell , they invented the term . 
  no that were the british in south africa . 
  still not the belgian congo , 
  georg friedrich the current head of the house of hohenzollern is in the business-consulting branche . 
  there was minor surge in support for a restoration of the monarchy when our former presiden wulff stepped down because of corruption alegations that turned out to be false . 
  i would n't mind a restoration of the monarchy but only because the president has nearly no powers at all . 
  well , i am all in favor of a european ** con ** federation , but i think it will be only possible through a two or three speed europe . 
  yes and no , we only use the 3rd stanca of the lied der deutschen which was already used before the nazis . 
  well , no and yes . 
  originally it only meant `` greater germany '' ( germany + austria ) . 
  this germanic empire thing ( netherlands , denmark , flanders , ... ) was something propagaded by the nazis . 
  german here , if the austrians want to try again i am more than happy to have a few new countrymen . 
  if they want us to join them , sure , i like their gun laws more than ours . 
  holy roman empire 2.0 ? 
  please ? 
   i want it to continue as well your comment history disproves this . 
   but it wo n't it will , in some form or another . 
  not what i meant , but til ... 
  reminds me of this east german joke :  it costs twenty mark ? 
  hell , that 's 40 in ost-markt . 
  that 's worth 80 ostmark on the black market !, 
  reminds me of this german joke about turks : an old lady is annoyed by a young turkish man turning up his music on the bus and asks him to turn it down . 
  he asks `` what are you going to do about it old lady ? '', 
  she says `` remember , we once had millions of jewish citizens '' sorry for the bad translation ... 
  nah , looks more like schenkkrug for beer . 
  shit , those turks are at it again , they are building a fleet !, 
  protect venice !, 
  call the pope !, 
  that 's true ... 
  the last time i saw pictures of their rallies , there were actual swastikas everywhere . 
  i 'm relaxed . 
  and even if he is , i can still try to have a civilized discussion with him . 
  not sure if you are making a joke about me or my region ... edit : people down voting you because they wo n't admit to the revenge crimes ... 
  you are free to leave . 
  i want the ever closer union to continue . 
  with or without you . 
  what ? 
  it is the glorious franconian rake . 
  gold shit ? 
  there is no gold you filthy heathen !, 
  poland is n't irrelevant or silly for us . 
  they are our neighbors and we respect them . 
  we have to or we would be at each other 's throats ... 
  we started ** one ** world war and learned from our sins . 
  the fact that this was nearly 3 generations ago and it is still used against us as a country in the political arena only proves that you should rather grow up . 
  we learned our lesson , you did n't . 
  you mean the same germany that was still occupied by foreign troops till 94 and even today is treated unfairly because of its past ? 
  dude , my username and flag should tell you that i am german ... 
  to be fair , there were scare storie by politicians circulating in poland that the germans would try to reclaim their land . 
  so it can go both ways . 
  golden dawn actively admits to being neo nazis and waves their swastikas proudly . 
  they are more like the npd . 
  nah , schr\u00f6der is the logical conclusion of brandt and schmitt . 
  the logical follow up would have been peer steinbr\u00fcck . 
  not according to ops source . 
  we are listed as number 7 on your foes list , right behind lithuania . 
  we are 7th most hated , right behind lithuania and above uk . 
  for comparison , in 2012 we were the 3rd most popular country . 
  they are not that bad yet , i just could n't resist the pun . 
  i 'm starting to believe that gauland is a double agent working for the union to destroy the afd . 
  nobody could be that stupid . 
  seriously , wtf ?!, 
  be happy and joyful , this time it will be a golden dawn ... 
  americans ? 
  there is a reason why i wrote `` according to reddit '' . 
  i 'm not saying that it is really the case . 
  how does this relate to anything discussed above ? 
  yesterday the first page of this sub was still filled with submissions in which germany is blamed for the migrant crisis , gets shit for their behavior in the euro crisis , gets shat on by poles for criticizing their government , brits complaining how germany is destroying europe again and a shit ton more . 
  that was the ottoman empire . 
  modern turkey and modern germany base most of their relationship on their cooperation in the western alliance nato . 
  they are not our friends . 
  more like the guy our friend the u.s. once brought to a party and since then is trying to enter our cool club but constantly behaves like an asshole . 
  according to reddit germany is as much hated in europe as japan is in asia . 
  maybe we should swap places . 
  last i checked we payed millions to private people who had a claim for compensation and gave your military junta a shit ton of money in the 70s . 
  not our fault that they were corrupt and kept it for them selves . 
  and jfk himself was a huge fan of the nazi movement and hitler . 
  because that would mean that suddenly a lot of countries are responsible for the shit that 's happening right now instead of just germany and sweden . 
  better to blame it all on merkel instead of admitting that invading irak and bombing libya was a bad idea . 
  nazi joke as far as i can tell ... 
  i am not sayying i support her , but i still support the cdu/csu as a party because compared to others it could be a lot worse . 
  paneuropean too ? 
  to be fair , syrians and arabs are white too ... 
  they claim they are politically prosecuted . 
  homosexuals , journalists and politicians . 
  all of them !, 
  german here . 
  i know some stereotypes about chechens but they are all negative . 
  - rapists , thieves , islamists , terrorists , murderers , mafiosos ... 
  i do n't take those stereotypes serious but chechens have been pretty over overrepresentated in the criminal statistics and in the media . 
  france right now is doing what germany did 16 years ago with the agenda 2010 .
