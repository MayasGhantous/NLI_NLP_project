nice idea for a thread , maybe we could get a collaboration with / r/books going . 
   from the german literature i know i would reccomend 1 . 
  g\u00fcnther grass - die blechtrommel ( the tin drum ) - a book i finished in little time for its intriguing plot and the absurd way of narration . 
  a protagonist so unlikeable and repelling combined with a depth of narration and a beautifully lyrical way of speaking . 
  sven regener - neue vahr s\u00fcd - first of the `` herr lehmann '' series , about a man in his twenties from northern germany , reluctant to start his life , forgetting to refuse participating in the obligatory military service in the 1980s . 
  he leaves the house of his parents and finds himself ( paralyzed ) in an absurd contrast of his military service and living with communist student housemates on the weekend . 
  everything everything from franz kafka - he wrote a lot of short stories many of his novels are only fragments , because he did not intend to publish them and a friend of his did not respect his will after his death . 
  thanks  anytime .

  this depends on the way you look at it . 
  there are a lot of people who would agree with you , the eu-officials and the german government included . 
  they think to make your country fit for competition you need to do structural reforms , e.g. 
  cut costs and raise efficency for example by fighting tax evation . 
  this is true but only one side of the medal . 
  in a nearly failed economy as the greek it is not enough to cut costs and raise efficency to make the economy recover . 
  it can also have negative effects on this recovery . 
  austerity at this point means cutting costs in the social sector , cutting pensions and salaries , investments for schools and hospitals etc. , this means things that would encourage growth and create employment are made impossible because the greek government is not allowed to spend money . 
  there is a whole economical philosophy behind it ( mainly keynes was the father of this kind of thought ) that tells you to behave non-cyclical instead of cyclical . 
  that means that as a state you should invest money in times of crisis - when money is tight for private investors - and save money when the economy is well . 
  this is why you should at least think critical about austerity from an academic point of view . 
  i do n't want to criticise everything that comes with it . 
  fighting tax evasion and corruption is important and raising efficency in public administration is important . 
  but still - at least from my point of view - austerity without creating a stimulus for growth is devastating . 
  and as from the point of view of the greek people they pay for austerity directly - they earn less , they get their pensions cut or loose their jobs in the public sector . 
  also they live in a country with a declining economy that does not offer a perspective for anybody , especially young people . 
  so even if it were economicly justifiable , the greek would probably oppose austerity for the direct negative effects on them . 
  i can get that people are pro-euro , but who would be pro-austerity ? 
  is this a thing ? 
  she also said in her christmas speech of 1994 that it was time to overcome the hostility and forgive germany . 
  but i am only quoting the article , i am not at all a queen beatrix expert , 
  it says [ here ] ( http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/populaere-koenigin-beatrix-erhaelt-den-aachener-karlspreis-die-monarchie-ist-in-den-niederlanden-unumstritten,10810590,9125010.html ) that she got it for helping to overcome the hostility between germany and the netherlands . 
  apparently she married a german and here people did not like it , and that helped europe .
