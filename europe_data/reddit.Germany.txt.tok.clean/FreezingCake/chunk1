[ well , it 's not like farage liked belgium to begin with ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz6rfxoefi4 ), 
  i 'd love to live near the atlantic , preferable france or ireland ( i like cliffs ) . 
  what 's isds ? 
  i have no idea what 's going on anymore . 
  not my intention to make it sound bad , maybe my english is just awkward . 
  of course . 
  i just did n't want to say `` most of those people probably only showed up because he died recently . '', 
  i guess nemzows death just made him a martyr . 
  [ build more walls ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opbsfglaefq ), 
  maybe i 'm stupid , but how does bbc draw the line to russians ? 
  the photographer saw guys with hunting rifles ( not really military style ? 
  ) , the other guy is talking about `` defending his country '' and that the weapons must have been organized by other protesters through one of their main buildings . 
   i live in a 90 % muslims area that area is to be found where exactly ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  in germany we usually do n't have a data cap on up/download . 
  but that does n't mean that piracy is rampant . 
  in germany it 's a business for many lawyers to go after pirates for a living , we call them `` abmahnanw\u00e4lte '' . 
  you do n't go to prison , but you have to pay a hefty fine everytime they catch you . 
  no need to ask him , since they also tested a bmw x5 . 
  they said it was fine . 
  this is such a shitty article . 
  german source , for reference , says something completely different :  http://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/gruene-regierung-kannte-abgas-problem-article15987536.html  im juli habe die bundesregierung auf anfrage der gr\u00fcnen einger\u00e4umt , dass die messpraxis in europa defizite habe the only thing they knew was that the way they measure in europe sucks . 
   \u00dcber den einsatz von `` abschalteinrichtungen '' in neuwagen l\u00e4gen der bundesregierung aber keine erkenntnisse vor they were not `` very aware '' , like that shitty tabloid claims , that vw cheats . 
  here is the complete answer ( in german ) :  http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/056/1805656.pdf,

  / u/ragnar _ ok seems to be a pretty decent guy from my point of view . 
  if you look through his posting history , he is pretty cynical ( like the quotes everyone repeats about `` handing the sub over to srs ) , but apart from that he is a really good mod . 
  he always states a reason why he removes a thread , he argues instead of blatantly deleting threads he dislikes , and is really active . 
  i guess he would make a great addition to your team and i 'm sure / u/dclauzel would like some company . 
   want to buy a sim in paris for use while i 'm there do you want one only for france , or a general one that you can use all over europe ? 
  apparently this is their proof . 
  no idea what it says or how comparing 2 photos from facebook makes him a mass murderer , but anyway . 
  to be taken with a grain of salt .

  easy internet points . 
  the picture i posted is the `` busbahnhof '' of frankfurt am main . 
  it 's really just that , a couple of stop signs in the open road . 
  you want to see a german bus station ?

  iran is more friendly towards jews than greece , til . 
   sprengstoffverdacht no dog detected anything yet . 
  so far it 's only a suspicion . 
  after all you 're still in a default sub on reddit . 
  do n't expect too much . 
  thanks for posting this , i did n't know any of this . 
  huh , turkey and lebanon are some of the richest countries in the world . 
  til . 
  is this your definition of objectivity ? 
  or did you try to say that denmark just took 4 million refugees ? 
  and refugees are not immigrants by the way . 
  so why would the refugees care about some obscure danish law that 's meant to get rid of eastern european economic migrants ? 
  yes , cool cherrypicking . 
  all the refugees who stay behind are not news worthy . 
  but if a hundred of 4 million march torwards sweden , its worth its own headline . 
  hate propaganda like this . 
  i was in tallinn last year and i was amazed at how beautiful the city is . 
  then i went to riga and compared to tallinn everything was kinda `` meh '' . 
  it 's not just your pr department :p, 
  a quiet voice ( a german ) behind the camera says that he will sell it the father ( i guess ? ), 
  then says louder something like `` nichts verkaufen '' or something like this , which means `` will not sell it '' the player responds by giving back the pencil . 
  i cant understand all of what he says but something like `` dann gibts auch nichts '' , `` then there will be nothing '' . 
  the quiet german from behind responds `` he das war doch nur ein scherz '' , `` it was only a joke . '', 
  so a dumb racist german made fun of a child and probably ruined the familys day . 
  but the nationality is never directly mentioned by anyone , as far as i can tell . 
  i guess they only knew the nationality because the family was speaking in their native language . 
  i 'm pretty sure the absolute number of laws in germany is way higher than the number of france . 
  but not just because of bureaucrazy . 
  more because we do n't have a centralized system and every `` bundesland '' and even every `` landkreis '' is able to make its own `` verordnung '' . 
  the number of 1.700 by l'opinion only considers `` bundesgesetze '' , there are another 2.700 `` bundesverordnungen '' and tens of thousands of `` landesverordnungen '' . 
  there is also an interactive map ( with more up to date data i believe ? ), 
  that 's exactly what i was trying to say . 
  judging by how fast dclauzels karma drains because he rustled some jimmies , i 'm not sure that 's a viable factor . 
   why not allow discussion about what ? 
  the frontpage is basically / r/europeanrefugee , there is literally no topic that is not covered . 
  so the only active mod in a top 100 sub hast the most active statistics . 
  conspiracy i tell ya . 
  whatever sells , right ? 
   france and germany are pushing for new eu-wide talks on what has been described as the worst migrant crisis since the second world war . 
  guess that does n't make a clickbaity headline , huh . 
   i think they should stay in countries which are more culturally close to them the thing is just , most of their culturally close countries are dicks as well . 
  they either still have ties with assad ( iran ) and do n't support the rebels , or they are also infested by isis ( iraq/afghanistan ) or they are simply too small and weak to even support themselves . 
  if you look at the chart i posted above , most of them do stay in neighbouring countries . 
   http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php, 
   http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php oh look at that . 
  most of them actually do stay in other `` safe '' countries . 
   his name is laith al-saleh and he was in the free syrian army . 
  you know , the guys backed by european powers . 
   germany needs a peace treaty with the allied forces this one cracks me up every time . 
  `` we are not free , the us is still a besatzungsmacht !, 
  wake up sheeple ! '', 
  [ nothing beats the hobo life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_6tbtp-eji ), 
  is there any context to the picture with the ak ? 
   this paper has suggested that an air travel-style screening regime for passengers and baggage would address these weak points . 
  some changes -- such as requiring identification on the purchase of tgv tickets -- are easily implemented while others , including the baggage and passenger screening , would be more difficult and involved . 
  public airports : 314 no . 
  train stations : 3,054 the only solution would be to seal 3054 train stations like airports . 
  that 's just completely insane . 
  and all the trains would need to be completely redesigned , so the luggage is stored safely away from passengers . 
  edit : those are just the train stations and airports within the borders of france . 
  it gets even more absurd if you include europe wide numbers .
