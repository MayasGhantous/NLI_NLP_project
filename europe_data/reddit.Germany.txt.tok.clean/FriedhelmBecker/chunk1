the protest still took place . 
  under police supervision . 
  b. . but the stereotype says that no one in russia is allowed to protest :( ( (, 
  i like the 2nd one  looks friendlier , just like you guys ^ ^, 
  proud ? 
  not sure , i do n't go around boasting hey people i do n't care about emissions . 
  but i know that euro 6 is almost impossible to achieve and everything that started with this urea injection is complete bull . 
  all my cars had a dpf and euro 4 , but adblue is too much . 
  besides , electric cars are coming , and as soon as they can achieve 800km i will instantly buy one . 
  until then i will drive my diesels with massive torque . 
  awesome , diesel car prices plummet , great for me !, 
  i love diesel , do n't care about emissions , i like torque haha e320cdi here i come . 
  you thought you were kidding when you said we can populate the school gym halls with refugees ? 
  sounds very scary ... 
  well , seeing as every single person i ever talked to in person in my state is against ** more and more ** refugees it would be wise for the politicians to finally say the truth . 
  that 's my party !, 
  same in germany , if you know bild , spiegel etc. 
  they rally so much pro-refugees , while ** anyone ** who i speak to is against it . 
  heck , they are in the school gym in my former gymnasium ( high school ) right next to the kids . 
  not saying it 's a threat , but it could be . 
  it takes 1 person out of the 250 to make this horror . 
  i thought this was a joke !, 
  i am from germany , bavaria and i am just in fear about these numbers . 
  every time i hear something about refugees i think more and more will come and they will still pour in and never leave . 
  you have to imagine you grew up in a rural area and suddenly it 's full of different people from other countries , some of them are nice , many of them are very religious . 
  it 's just either a thing to adjust or i do n't know . 
  the part where i live in is not culturally diverse so seeing these refugees is something new . 
  i think big cities in germany have so many ethnicities that they do n't even notice a couple more `` syrians '' ( balkan + syria mostly ) . 
  it 's not that i hate them or have a grudge about them , not at all , it 's just a new situation and i 'm trying to get as much info to as when this is going to stop and how the countries will handle the influx . 
  unfortunately , the borders are still open and even after nearly 1 million , we will get more and more . 
  i mean , germany can handle maybe one million , but it 's more and more each year and in 8 years it 's 8 million ? 
  ironically , i fell like the only way for me to escape this whole immigrant drama is to migrate to switzerland ... 
  i lived there for 5 years before , so they might take me back ( i always behaved well and made my matura there ), 
  friendly reminder ? 
  i see about 8-10 russia posts every day here . 
  no need for a reminder , i see that nothing changes in russia . 
  you wish, 
  look at all the pfand, 
  where can i find this video ? 
  i want to know how i am being threatened . . 
  i call bs on anything . 
  it 's more and more lgbt propaganda that lgbt people have disadvantages . 
  for the western most european countries , i.e luxembourg , belgium , denmark , netherlands , germany , uk etc. 
  that is simply not true !, 
  the only thing that pisses me off are those parades , where they oversexualize ( at least here ) and go out in slutty clothes and whatnot . 
  everything else is perfectly fine and normal and even in the most conservative state ( all hail my precious bavarian csu ) i would never guess that anyone would be harassed by a rightful german citizen for holding hands or kissing with a same-sex partner . 
  yes , great !, 
  and the 30cents per kwh that have suddenly risen from like 18cents are great , too !, 
  half the posts are `` one hectar is a joke '' if my country just gave me one hectar of land i would scream in joy !, 
  hell if they gave me one square meter for free i would be delighted , but in my country , ** nothing ** is free ... 
  hmm people are usually young on this sub , you will see the results of this helping . 
  but the spirit is very positive here . 
  ok this sub is pro us alright , jesus the downvotes on the comments lol, 
  the growth is definitely hit , but not to a very noticeable degree . 
  still , you see it in the charts , 
  but ... the current anti-gay voters wo n't be here anymore eventually and i ca n't think of a person i know in my age + - 5 years who is against gay marriage , so eventually in roughly 20 years maybe it will be legalized in the worst case scenario i think , or when the spd will be on the top . 
  ( but they do n't even have a chancellor candidate for the next election lol ) besides , i had this convo a lot . 
  if it 's called different , but you have the same rights ( tax , adoption and all the pi-pa-po , i would n't care ) hell i will probably never marry in my life , so i would gladly give my right to a gay couple haha, 
  mostly old people in the conservative party voted against it . 
  not to sound too grim , but they will eventually die and the younger ones mostly voted yes , so meh . . 
  besides that same-sex couples can get the same benefits in most of the states ( not sure about my state bavaria , but the term exists here too ) `` eingetragene lebenspartnerschaft '' something like that . 
  definitely . 
  i am against immigrants nowadays ( because 5 years ago there were a lot less and we could handle them and now we can not ) , but this cover is pretty ridiculous i think ... 
  any of the mint subjects will guarantee you a job where i live . 
  sociology , history etc. 
  not so much ... 
  based on this map yes lol , just kidding , but you clearly see a distinction , do n't you ? 
  i think in the next 20 years or so the whole map can be blue , if we work together !, 
  still silly how east is always red and west blue . . 
  far-west !, 
  it 's not only that , everytime you compare stats like gdp etc. 
  there is still a clear gap from old soviet times . 
  luckily ( ! ), 
  this gap is getting closer every year , especially with poland . 
  but at the moment the statistics always show east red and west blue somehow lol . 
  why not the opposite ? 
  tragic , but tell me now after i have been downvoted by saying poland etc. 
  are eastern europe . 
  how are hungary etc. 
  not eastern ? 
  such a clear distinction . 
  i really hope the coming years will make the situation more even , 
  best country, 
  i thought about how incredibly stupid it would be for protesters to set their country on fire since it will demolish the economy even further . 
  now after reading the comments i think about how incredibly ** more ** stupid it is to burn these forests to build stuff on it . . holy fuck the world is fucked up . . 
  just looked at some pictures , it seems like the columns were removed , so no lions for me :(, 
  hey !, 
  there are still plenty of people who want to be back in the ddr . 
  what about them ? 
  : / they regularly complain in germany :(, 
  there 's still a difference between east and west germany and we pay `` soli-tax '' for east germany . 
  is germany more like france or more like poland ? 
  i know that poland for example is on its way up from corruption etc. , but you still really notice that it was in the eastern block . 
  if you do n't see that i think you are blind . . same with east germany you just notice the ugly housing blocks built in soviet times . 
  i 'm just realistic . 
  geographically , maybe center . 
  average wages ? 
  buildings ? 
  parts of the culture ? 
  it will take more years until what was done by soviet times is reversed .
