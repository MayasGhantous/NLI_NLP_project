  how old is putin ? 
  i believe in 20 years when we all have equality russia can start working on equality too, 
  yes , definitely , considering i live next to frankfurt ( but still in bavaria of course !!, 
  harrharr ) i love to see the skyline , and they are building new buildings there , 
  ok great then , problem solved . 
  russia keeps anti-gay laws and all gays move away . 
  top solution . 
  i would love to have something like that in my country . . not with the nazi symbols of course , but it kind of seems pretty epic to me . 
  some lion statues or something on top of the pillar rawr, 
  born and raised in lithuania ? 
  ca n't handle the stress, 
  i like the discussions i dislike the absolute drastic moodswings . 
  2 weeks ago we were all pitchforking for a hard grexit , now we have germany for being too harsh on greece , wtf happened ? 
  both of these opinions are nonsense . 
  i think we need more sensibility and human understanding . 
  be friendly , no matter of the origin and how your country is . 
  also the russia-hate is unreal , although lately greece overshadowed this . 
  i think we should start embracing euroscepticism as a different opinion and people of different countries and maybe add some discussion room for ** conservative ** people . 
  this place sometimes feels like a leftist-liberal-easygoing place . 
  i have more to say on the negative but apart from what i mention everything is pretty good and i visit this sub fairly often , because there are some gems under populist comments  keep on rocking / r/europe, 
  how is it a messed up place ? 
  it 's one of the best places to live in currently lol, 
  in germany you say `` die runde geht auf mich '' -- `` this round is on me '' and you will pay for them : /, 
  i hear you , everyone is entitled to his own opinion , i just want to know when this dignity ends ? 
  can it be quantified in a number ? 
  that 's because we have no effective way to control it . 
  word there spreads that you just have to make it across and it 's totally safe . 
  and we let them in . 
  i am not skilled enough to know how to solve this big time , but if they are either really really scared to make that journey or just know that they will be turned back , they will not flee . 
  the attitude of being liberal and having open borders and just giving them free food and shelter . 
  yeah , great . 
  so the top 1 % runs the country and the rest is uneducated unemployed immigrants due to failure of immigration systems . 
  we can not handle so many at the moment , they will end up on the streets . 
  reform first , then let them in , instead of letting them rot in their asylum homes . 
  europe has been too liberal on anything for the past times . 
  i became a eurosceptic because of the green/leftist measures we have taken . 
  the opposition you get when you say close the borders is just insane . 
  i like the schengen system , but i am bashed when i say we have too much immigrants , when clearly in germany we have just ** too much ** . 
  issues like these need to be addressed asap , because it 's more and more every year . 
  of course that 's only one issue . 
  eu just is n't harsh enough in enforcing rules , because big old germany is the boss and ca n't do anything that seems harsh because everyone thinks back to the nazi regime . 
  we need a federation , a leader , go big or go home . 
  whoever does n't want to dedicate 100 % gets kicked out . 
  right now we have a bunch of half assed countries relaxing in the eu security . 
  i applaud the baltics btw for adapting so quickly and being eager to reform . 
  exactly !, 
  they just want to spread the love , 
  but i really love going through the `` priority line '' in the airport because i am an eu citizen . 
  til bumping into someone is considered physical violence . 
  in russia this is just a normal greeting . 
  if you are very enthusiastic you pull out your gun . 
  honestly , those people will punch you for everything , being gay was just the trigger . 
  you could be wearing ugly pants or whatever . . 
  would n't a team of about 50 economists know that as opposed to random redditors ? 
  not against you , but suddenly everyone theorizes and knows how greece can and ca n't be saved while being a young demographic ... 
  sounds like a grim future , but i still hope for the best : /, 
  the pure definition of populism i guess . 
  they have nothing better to do than to comment on www.bild.de :d, 
  i also have this feeling . 
  these eurozone people are , despite what everyone says , very proficient and worked their whole lives like this . 
  average people do n't care as much as going on a website and posting their opinion , we redditors do lol, 
  reddit is much more civil , but why would n't i ? 
  i want to know what the people think of the situation and what better place is it to look at a middleclass newspaper and look at the comments ? 
  the populism is real , but well ... it 's the populus , what can i do, 
  i really hope 3rd time 's the charm , but i doubt it . 
  let 's look at it like this : the politicians are against a grexit , but if you look at the comment section in the newspapers there are just tons and tons of eu citizens pro grexit . 
  they just say enough is enough . 
  so if this goes through the politicians lose trust . 
  newspapers have been building up to a grexit in germany , everyday we had grexit grexit grexit and now suddenly there 's an agreement . 
  good for you . 
  bad for you . 
  that 's all i can say , let 's just hope your country wo n't rot any further due to new austerity measures . 
  bullshit , the feeling here changes twice daily . 
  1 week ago everyone was pro-grexit , now everyone wants to keep greece in the euro . 
  mood swings on / r/europe that 's it . 
  at the end of the day greece stays in the euro and we keep pumping more money in ( i really really hope 3rd time 's the charm ) now everyone is happy again and chills until the next crisis . 
  stop being so sensationalist and keep cool . 
  in western europe , there are very little roma compared to other populations , the stereotype is that they are beggars . 
  running around with roses and selling them . 
  i have actually been confronted by those beggars several times . 
  i am pretty neutral about them because we also have beggars from other foreign countries or german `` punks '' with their crazy hair . 
  if you have decency nobody will judge you for being a roma , it 's the behaviour that counts of course , 
  those two can afford to pay their part of the debt , 
  it stinks ( quite literally ) but it 's fun, 
  exactly what i thought about . 
  http://images.delcampe.com/img_large/auction/000/063/998/835_001.jpg?v=9 sad ... really sad, 
  i ca n't even anymore . . 
  ukraine is not an eu member neither nato ? 
  wtf ? 
  literally the only interesting thing i see in this conflict nowadays, 
  you 're hired !, 
  seriously , though , turkey even has the car license plates like the eu haha . 
  are you suggesting we take in our great turkish neighbors ? 
  i throw receipts away anyways : /, 
  i 'm living in the rhein main region , it will be 40 \u00b0 tomorrow , ama xd, 
  hopefully you will meet reasonable eurosceptics in your life : / sounds pretty shitty to only have empty arguments around you . 
  maybe you will visit franconia :d, 
  xd that name, 
  i would flee together with you , i 'm not that different anyways , 
  so sad that they have a different opinion than you,
