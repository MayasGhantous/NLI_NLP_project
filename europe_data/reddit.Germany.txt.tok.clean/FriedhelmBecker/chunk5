  it 's really a tough situation we have , but honestly it should be somehow divided by the countries because somehow people like to seek asylum in the rich countries like france germany uk , and not in the less rich countries like poland hungary . 
  but this is again so difficult because the richer countries have more money to care for the refugees ... argh : / politics * sigh *, 
  we have enough in bavaria keepo, 
  more independence , own rules for its countries . 
  made me chuckle haha :d, 
  i do n't see any discrimination in franconia area . 
  one of my friends changed name , identity , everything to female and had no issues . 
  not in his work , not with his community etc. 
  just because bavaria is stereotypically conservative does n't mean they are dicks to lgbt people . 
  german - native russian - native level english - c2 degree spanish - c1 degree french - c1 degree, 
  everything related to anything anyhow positive to russia is a creepy cult and gets upvotes . 
  fuck tradition : /, 
  i 'm pretty happy with germany 's 50 %  we have no bias towards lgbt in our society ( in bavaria at least ), 
  nur bares ist wahres for obvious reasons ( it 's an idiom from germany which says that only cash is the way to go ), 
  i see , just looked through your comment history . 
  seems to be a downvote magnet for all the sensitive europeans on this sub : / i see this as a big success for ukip since they had only some 3 % last time and now 13 !, 
  look at the growth lol . . 
  like i said in the other thread . 
  people cry that they wo n't vote ukip and yet they are 3rd biggest  people on the internet are always for free borders and stuff, 
  im sorry , not an english native . 
  is that statement pro or contra ukip results ? 
  because it seems to me they got a big boost :p, 
  it 's called `` lebenspartnerschaft '' here and i think it will be kept . 
  oopsie , did n't really know that . . i 'm not up2date in that field :( sorry my bad . 
  german here , they are accepted . 
  they can have a civil union and i think that 's okay . 
  the term `` marriage '' is used in a religious context and afaik , homosexuals are not accepted by traditional religion like catholics or protestants . 
  they are seen neutral in society , nothing special overall , although some people do things like `` walk away '' when they sit near a homosexual couple making out . 
  it 's their right . 
  politically they have no disadvantage whatsoever , they can get every job they want and are not treated with disrespect professionally . 
  now that 's only what i noticed in my region , in other regions ( east-german small villages for example ) it might be different . 
  i hear that people say their tap water is great . 
  i believe that the water is great when it leaves the filtration center . 
  but by the time it flows through your old tubes it 's not so good anymore . 
  i 've installed a home filtration system to prevent that . 
  since 80 % is putin/not putin its no sense . . 
  i do n't think i 'm that nationalistic , but i think it shows some respect and preparation for tourists and for foreigners who stay in the country that 's a no-brainer of course they need to adapt . 
  fun thing in switzerland , though , since no one speaks all 3 languages . 
  germans usually learn french and vice-versa . 
  in most cases , few basic phrases are enough and show that you respect the country you are visiting . 
  thank god the stereotype of the american tourist who speaks loudly in his southern accent is not true in my opinion . 
  i never met those  in general most tourists i met on my journeys tried to speak the respective language . 
  the guy on the other end of the phone must be thinking wtf is he talking in polish ? 
  yeah definitely , what is your experience in those foreign countries , do they usually speak english ? 
  it really depends on the company but this is considered an upper middle class company car . 
  the next lower variant is vw passat , audi a4 , 3series bmw etc. 
  we really like cars and companies like to compensate the wages and paying less taxes haha, 
  better be safe , 
  daang totally forgot about that . 
  since dutch is a variation we usually try to speak german first since we consider you our closest neighbors culturally i think . 
  i think polish has some elements of it too , right ? 
  as a german , i would like to work in belgium . 
  a6 / 5series bmw / eclass are typical work cars here, 
  honestly ? 
  i as a german think it 's still in a developing state . 
  give it 10 years and it will be better . 
  you just see that huge gap in gdp / capita, 
  no offense but it sounds similar to ukrainian . 
  i also noticed you have the same `` i '' in the alphabet, 
  hahahaha saying kurwa in english, 
  lol, 
  50 % / french . 
  it depends on the region , but i noticed on the internet even if 2 germans are communication , they are doing it in english for the sake of others . 
  i 'm quite different and i love my language and i love to speak it , even if there might be a non-speaker nearby if it does n't concern him . 
  ( for example talking about cars with my german mate while there is an english speaker in skype who does not care about this at all ), 
  its not rude to speak in your language in your country . 
  even if your entire population spoke only francais , it would be problematic , but not rude . 
  if i am a foreigner , i have to adapt to you and not you to me  greetings from germany, 
  europe  us for me : s sorry , but us is not the equivalent for freedom . 
  paying greece for some warcrimes is not representing my opinion . 
  credits over credits , this has to stop . 
  lending is bad . . 
  `` freedom '', 
  true, 
  i realize this is an `` artistic '' video and yet i was not conveyed by it nor do i think it 's 100 % right . 
  i do believe that there were some important points about equality and the chance to live there . 
  the greeks just made poor choices with their politicians . 
  yes right-of-center is probably the word i am looking for . 
  the csu is christian . 
  i just think we should think more about how `` open '' in terms of welcoming we want to be . 
  for example the green and left party want a speed limit in germany and csu would never allow that because it 's `` tradition '' . 
  i think the csu is less extreme than ukip , but they want ** very ** light restrictions on foreigners , too . 
  not close the borders or anything . 
  also bavaria is the only state with direct democracy in germany , where you can have a `` b\u00fcrgerbegehren '' , which is basically you change the laws if you earn enough votes . 
  it 's a little difficult to explain , but the csu is unique since it only exists in the state of bavaria and is called the `` union '' together with the cdu which acts for the rest of the country . 
  tradition , freedom , conservative is what they are and they are backed by the very strong bavarian economy and good lifestyle . 
  generally the south of germany is more wealthy than the north . 
  and partly , it 's the party that has by far the most votes because `` it just works '' . 
  never change a running system . 
  and by that i mean i want to be conservative . 
  germany is good now , please do n't change , but liberal people tend to push for change . 
  another controversial topic is gay marriage . 
  i think gay marriage should not be called `` marriage '' or `` heirat/ehe '' since this is a christian term . 
  i do , however , think that `` civil partnership/same-sex union '' should have the ** same ** benefits as `` marriage '' . 
  that 's not the case currently in bavaria , they base it on the catholic / christian values . 
  germany is fine the way it is now . 
  no changes please : s i 'd just like to discuss about it , you know . 
  especially since greece is now a topic again . 
  thanks for elaborating on that , i still do n't put them on the same level , but i 'm grateful for getting more info on them as an outsider !, 
  as a german-bavarian , i have always been more conservative , but apparently fn is not comparable to our csu party .
