  so its not that germany or france forces the rest of the union , but when both agree on a issue most of europe will follow . 
  of course , every voice in europe should be heard , thats why the eu commission has 28 members and the european parliament gives more seats to the smaller countries ( in relation to their population size ) . 
  but france and germany are the cornerstones of the union . 
  the eu can survive without spain or poland . 
  but with either germany or france leaving , the union would be over . 
  the bombing of dresden at the end of the war was excessive , i do n't argue that . 
  but after guernica , rotterdam and coventry no one should try to claim the moral high ground in regards to bombing cities . 
   but it is a bit ridiculous to build a shell resembling the original stadtschloss the idea is n't that ridiculous . 
  they did it before . 
  in my hometown potsdam , right next to berlin , they did just that . 
  they rebuild their prussian stadtschloss , which was also torn down by the gdr . 
  from the outside it looks just like the original but within its all modern . 
  its used as the regional parliament today and it works quite well .

  as a german , im glad france returns to its position as one of the leaders of europe . 
  their absence the last few years put germany in the spot light . 
  which was n't good , neither for us nor for the advancement of the european union . 
  this is not the german reichstagsbuilding . 
  after the reichstagsbrand the nazis moved , the now powerless , reichstag to the groll opera house . 
  estonia takes over eu ~ ~ presidency ~ ~ i for one , welcome our new estonian overlords, 
  i 've been there a few years ago . 
  what a nice city !, 
  there are still a few places that look terrible but the city center makes up for that . 
  but the name !, 
  i have trouble pronouncing that `` not-l '' . 
  im trying to say it the right way when talking to others but at home i just say breslau . 
  sorry poland . 
  edit : i really liked walking through the market hall : https://media-cdn.holidaycheck.com/w_1024,h_768,c_fit,q_80/ugc/images/742bba63-c032-3d34-9f91-ce9bd56fe8b8, 
  i stood at exactly the same spot just a few weeks ago . 
  granada and the alhambra are great places !, 
  and its not like people were going to easy on him . 
  there were some heavy questions regarding his drone strikes and the role of the us in the refugee crisis . 
   `` spectators snap photos of obama behind security barricade in berlin , as he lectures trump on dangers of walls . '', 
  that was only the part right next to the stage . 
  so that nobody can walk around it . 
  which is a good idea since both the former us president , the chancellor of germany and the head of the protestant church in germany were on this stage . 
  there was no wall between the stage and the people in the front . 
  source : i was there, 
  the saarland still has french as mandatory second language in school . 
  i think learning english is important but im all for making french the mandatory third language in school . 
  i picked spanish back then and im kinda regretting it now . 
  i only used it once while i was on vacation in spain . 
  french would have been more useful in retrospective . 
  im sorry to correct you , but after the new lazever . 
  par . 
  3 you have to increase your daily smiling time to at least 112 seconds or you have to pay up to 200 $ ordnungsgeld . 
  having fun is no laughing matter !, 
  i had to chance to see him give a speech in berlin , back when he was a candidate in the lr primaries . 
  he changed between french , english and german during one speech . 
  that was really impressive . 
  i think it depends on how you meassure the different bridges . 
  this one here : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rgnq8d6qamy/u4zg3kxrwsi/aaaaaaaabca/xf1du0fst0u/s1600/foto+19.jpg is between germany and the czech republic . 
  and i have walked over even smaller bridges to cross from germany to the czech republic ( but i cant find a picture ) . 
  you have to look at the context . 
  he denied ( in this interview ) his meeting with assange and didnt explained what they have discussed . 
  he denied his meeting with the russians and what they have talked about . 
  he had a intense reaction when asked about getting money from russia . 
  meeting foreign diplomats in general is not a problem . 
  the way he does it makes him look suspicious . 
  because its simply not true . 
  these far-right demagogues need to be called out for their lies . 
  they got this far because everybody was too polite to interrupt them when they spew their hate . 
  its the medias job to be the watchdog of our society . 
  and farages intense reaction just shows that they hit a sore spot . 
  the member states of the european union enjoy unprecedented levels of wealth and prosperity . 
  and he is a active danger to that . 
  so what ? 
  ** farage : ** i want to destroy the eu . 
  and i do n't care if god or the dalai lama want it too . 
  the eu is a failed , anti-democratic project . 
  you know , you are the first person directly asking me , if russia supports me . 
  no other journalist in the whole world did that before . 
  ** zeit online : ** i just try to understand the role you play . 
  ** farage : ** we do n't have connections to russia . 
  ** zeit online : ** so you never met the russian deputy ambassador in the russian embassy in london ? 
  ** farage : ** no . 
  ** zeit online : ** not in 2013 , before making plans for the brexit campaign ? 
  ** farage : ** ah , wait a minute . 
  he came to me , here in my office in the european parliament . 
  maybe i did met him in london . 
  * so what ? 
  * ** zeit online : ** why did you met him ? 
  ** farage : ** i think you are a loon !, 
  you are a real nutcase !, 
  the brexit was the best thing to ever happen - for russia , for america and for germany . 
  thats what counts !, 
  i hope someone translate the whole interview . 
  farage is truly a terrible person . 
  thank you zeit online for not giving up when he tried to avoid questions !, 
  i have been to estonia last august and thought i can have a beach day in p\u00e4rnu . 
  the travel guide i had read before called it `` the summer capital of estonia '' i got 16 \u00b0 c and rain ... but tallinn made up for the shitty weather . 
  definitely worth a visit !, 
  `` they give a great big fuck about the illegal immigration and merkel inviting the economic migrants from the middle east , unilateraly , and then forcing the other countries ( poland , hungry , the uk , slovakia ) ... '' no . 
  she didnt invite anybody . 
  the refugees where already in central europe . 
  people are forgetting what the situation has been like back then . 
  http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/multimedia/photo-gallery/2015/9/photos-hungary-closes-train-station-to-stem-flow-of-refugees/_jcr_content/slideshowimages/slide2/image.adapt.960.high.hungary_refugees_station_02a.jpg thats how the budapest train station looked like . 
  the relativ smaller and poorer eu countries could n't deal with these numbers so germany did the right thing and took them . 
  the dublin agreement does n't work . 
  nobody can expect italy and greece to take care of this problem alone .
