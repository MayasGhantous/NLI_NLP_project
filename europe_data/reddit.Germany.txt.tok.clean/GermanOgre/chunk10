  maybe you can provide us with a better path for social justice . 
  how would you you combat generations of abuse/racism from your government ? 
  so soros funding the looting of ferguson mo business ? 
  i had to look up this claim : http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/sorosferguson.asp his organisations have the following goals :  the open society foundations work to build vibrant and tolerant societies whose governments are accountable and open to the participation of all people . 
   we seek to strengthen the rule of law ; respect for human rights , minorities , and a diversity of opinions ; democratically elected governments ; and a civil society that helps keep government power in check . 
  sounds pretty reasonable to me . 
  especially in ferguson . 
  a city 67 % black . 
  the us justice department says :  in 88 percent of the cases in which the department used force , it was against african americans . 
  in all of the 14 canine-bite incidents for which racial information was available , the person bitten was african american . 
  in ferguson court cases , african americans are 68 percent less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge , according to the justice review . 
  in 2013 , african americans accounted for 92 percent of cases in which an arrest warrant was issued . 
  blm distanced itself and denounce any form of violence in ferguson . 
   which make me see through the bullshit and the hypocrisy sadly it does n't seem so . 
  materialism is alive and well in germany . 
  if i remember correctly the israelite of russian origin tend to be much more to the right . 
  they tend to have more extreme anti-arab and pro settlement views then other israeli jewish groups . 
  yisrael beiteinu would fit into this mold . 
  according to your link :  280 900 first instance decisions [ 3 ] were made by the national authorities of eu member states during the third quarter of 2016 . 
  among them , 63 % were positive . 
  pretty much in line what i had . 
  i do n't see 27 % in there . 
  maybe you can tell us where the this is . 
  if you ca n't , then please retract your statement please . 
   however , its still countless times better than what 's being done i heard walls do n't hold people back . 
  especially long walls in non populous areas . 
   you realize that only 27 % of them are actual refugees , right ? 
  has n't that always been the case with asylum seekers ? 
  that is why governments have agencies that check the veracity of their claims and send back `` false '' refugees . 
  would be nice if you would supply the link as well i could not find it . 
  found a eurostat that shows much higher percentage of real refugees ; with only 27 % rejection rate in germany . 
  putting all these figures from this pic into excel shows an overall rejection rate around 35 % for the six countries . 
  or 65 % actual refugees , right ? 
  :p http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/7/7f/first_instance_decisions_by_outcome%2c_selected_member_states%2c_3rd_quarter_2016.png  as for the others - meet yuge border wall . 
  sounds like a plan for a logistical nightmare . 
  i would like to see some numbers on how efficient border walls in less populous areas are . 
  i doubt they are terribly efficient . 
  what about the sea route ? 
  border walls on the beaches ? 
  must be nice to get off on feigning outrage over everything . 
  personally , i need my blue pills . 
  :( based on your comment history i can see you have no desire to have an adult discussion about complex topics . 
  you are an israeli fanboy/girl and nothing else . 
  good day sir or madame . 
  `` an eye for an eye and soon the entire world is blind . '' considering the israelis are in a extreme privileged position of power , security wise and economically speaking , it would be nice if a start would come form them . 
  but doubt this is going to happen . 
  too much post holocaust angst from the eastern european faction . 
  this is a discussion forum . 
  if discussing certain topics triggers you maybe you should avoid them . 
  calling people bigots just because they ask you to calm down also does n't reflect well on your sanity . 
  like germany went to a market , bought and imported the refugees . 
  i guess we should have kept them unchecked in forest camps in eastern europe . 
  or better yet , send them back to a war zone . 
  can we elect you as their bus driver ? 
  is that your solution ? 
  i bet the radicalized ones would have made it to europe nonetheless . 
  just in your scenario they would be underground and harder to keep tabs on . 
  all i ever hear is you whine about a complex problem . 
  yet never do i see a viable solution to it . 
  you are obviously unable to discus this in a non-emotional manner . 
  please take you medications or a vein may pop . 
  that would make us sad . 
  it seems einstein was more outspoken in 1948 then the last 20 years of israeli governments . 
  not surprising given some of the top leaders involvements in massacres . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabra_and_shatila_massacre some day perhaps the states involved will renounce the violence and some healing can be attempted aka willy brandt style . 
  they have the same penchant for creating media deflections and falsehoods . 
   if an actual islamic country can do this then why the fuck ca n't somewhere like belgium ? 
  in the article you posted , the young man ** was arrested by belgian police ** and received a 3 year suspended sentence due to lack of evidence . 
  are you suggesting european countries should set up a guantanamo bay operation or the death penalty for admitting to whipping people ? 
  the rule of law is a funny thing and i would not advocate changing it for something like this . 
  it can always backfire in the long run . 
  some people forget real quick . 
  putin likes that . 
  how would you like to live in a refugee camp for 50 + years . 
  having no rights , living in near apartheid conditions and depending on the invaders of your lands generosity after they kicked you out of your homeland . 
  would you still show sympathy for them ? 
  i am not saying its right , but i can understand their celebrations . 
  sorry you feel i 'm unpleasant when i try to understand your line of thought . 
  libraries are a thing . 
   stymieing proper discussion within this forum within this forum on real issues by actually using real details says the person who ca n't follow a train of thought and answers a simple and straightforward question :  any data on the % that did n't feel safe before the migrant crisis ? 
  with some bird brained generalizations . 
  to bad u/neurologicaldisorder was not man/woman enough to show which country they come from . 
  this way we ca n't deride and make fun of that country 's educational system . 
  are these all curse words or do they convey other meanings ? 
  the english word damn can have several other meanings outside its vulgar use . 
   the integration report shows afghans/iraqis in `` other non-western '' which is much higher than dutch averages as you can see . 
  so you proved the universal truth that no one in this thread was debating , congratulations . 
  you obviously have a reading comprehension disorder , or the trump is strong with you , young delfectioneer . 
  here i will lay the argument out for you in small pieces : u/sausageparty2015 said :  with the influx of middle-eastern migrants in germany , incidents like these have definitely increased ** oranges are red ** u/cmdrbratwurst replies :  this is a problem of northern africans . 
  they are statically very over represented in crimes ** oranges are actually orange ** u/sausageparty2015 replies  strange because they are incredibly over represented in sexual assaults in austria and overall crime in netherlands and denmark . 
  iraqis are also overrepresented in danish statistics . 
  so i have trouble believing afghans in germany somehow buck the trend . 
  ** really , oranges are red ** then u/sausageparty2015 provides some links without explanation that in his own words :  the integration report shows afghans/iraqis in `` other non-western '' which is much higher than dutch averages  only syrians show a crime index factor below that of native danes with iraq and afghanistan ** oranges are fruit ** one thing i would recommend doing is taking a course in logic . 
  it was really an eye opener and quite fun/challenging . 
  in my opinion it should be taught at school level , yet never is . 
  :( http://logic.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/main.htm, 
  the ad hominem argument is a valid point nowadays . 
  did n't you know ? 
  what did you expect when you wrestle the brown mud . 
   people like you can be really toxic to an environment like this .
