  less in others ( teachers , all liberal arts degrees , etc. ), 
  then in europe . 
  cost of living for many things is higher there then in germany ( food was about twice as expensive ) . 
  rent/mortgage can be up or down depending on where you live . 
  heating and electricity of course much cheaper in the us . 
  the problem is that cost of education in the us has gone up many times more then inflation . 
  the university i went to in 2000 was $ 4,160 . 
  now it 's $ 12,546 . 
  that 's almost a triple increase in 16 years . 
  while the greatest generation and boomers were able to pay off their loans in a couple of years , gen xers and millennials typically need and will need between 10 and 20 years . 
  if that sounds just then go for it . 
  diesel automobiles emit about 20 times more nitrogen oxides than gasoline cars . 
  they also emit many times more fine particulates . 
  because of their small size , inhaled particles may easily penetrate deep into the lungs . 
  long term exposures can lead to chronic , more serious health problems such as cardiovascular disease , cardiopulmonary disease , and lung cancer . 
  one german governmental report from 2001 states that they believe 14400 people die per year due to diesel emissions . 
  in this regard the americans ( especially the california epa ) were ahead of europe and set the emission caps higher for diesels . 
  that is why diesel is not as common in the usa ( for automobiles ) as in western european countries . 
  i hope europe gets rid of that other symbol of slavery and sexual inequality : the nun 's habit . 
  may the nun be free of this burden put upon her by a men 's world . 
  may she wear the clothes god intended for humans : the birthday suit . 
  not soon enough !, 
  the german government lied to its citizens when it decided to majorly push diesel on them and those in charge should be prosecuted for the decisions resulting in tens of thousands of deaths . 
  better universities at the top end as long as you can afford it . 
  the bang for your buck is not there in the us for low to mid tier universities . 
  heck they have for profit universities that had to close cause they lied about the finding work rate of graduates . 
  one thing to keep in mind is that , while nearly 100 % of a european country 's military spending goes towards nato , only part of the us funds go towards nato . 
  the us has large military commitments in japan , korea , philippines , iraq , bahrain , etc. 
  we have extinct ones . 
  since no one knows what is covered and what is not , these poor innocent corporations fight tooth and nail with their customers over the validity of each billing item . 
  in the us these companies have no restrictions and act accordingly . 
  germans do n't know how good they have it . 
  the american system will never work , as long as you have a system where healthy young people are n't forced to be insured . 
  the only alternative is for hospitals to require payment before rendering services . 
  amazing to live in an age where you can search , find and access these documents instantly from your home . 
   like say a german citizen murdered 10 people so multiple homicides are not typically capital offenses in the us ? 
   there are very few students that actually generate that money well at least socialism works in the ncaa . 
  they could not extradite to a state with the death penalty . 
  federal us law also has the death penalty . 
  do n't know , but it looks more like around 25 % on this graph . 
  ( annual shrinkage rates of ca . 
  7 % + 8 % + 13 % from 1930 through 1933 ) https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:gdp_growth_1923-2009.jpg not surprising considering the growth rates of the prior years . 
  leave it to the american to disbelieve in an elitist takeover of control . 
  how is it shitting on ? 
  why do you get triggered this easily ? 
  it 's an observation i made as a dual citizen who grew up in europe and the us . 
  by your own logic you would be shitting on europe by writing ( not that i see it that way ) :  but western europeans who think their countries became stronk solely because of their own good deeds are a bit misguided your point is a valid point for people who see it this way . 
  as of yet i have n't seen/met many of them . 
  ( perhaps afders ) my observation i thought worth noting in this context . 
  why not address the question ? 
  why need to state `` god bless america '' at every public function ? 
  maybe i have a warped meaning of the word bless from playing ad&d in my youth . 
   factor in that many european countries started becoming the most powerful in the world by exploiting those countries highlighted in green and you might feel like a bit of a dick though . 
  typically , people in we recognize how privileged they are and * lucky * the were to be on the right hand side of history . 
  so much in fact , that when i have gone to church here i have never heard our pastor utter the words `` god bless germany '' . 
  in fact i have never heard those words . 
  instead the blessings are reserved for less fortunate people mostly in foreign countries . 
  something i did not encounter in 2 of the 3 churches i went to in the us ... 
  i would second this if he had n't advocated deliberately fake news media outlets and being a low effort candidate . 
   i think there are occasions where it favours interpretations that represent either western/northern european culture against eastern/southern european culture , and non-russian culture against russian culture . 
  that is an interesting statement . 
  in what sense does r/europe favor these interpretations ? 
  can you give an example ? 
  how can beings that grow up in these divisions transcend them . 
  what can r/europe do ? 
  its a ship going to be built in the future , with a mission to : * explore strange new worlds ; to seek out new life and new civilizations ; to boldly go where no man has gone before * . 
  kind of what europeans did 400 to 200 years ago . 
  again no substance from you , just lies . 
  back up your claim . 
  i guess we can agree to disagree on the magnitude of general ignorance . 
   without context , it sounds like it was a fight between two belligerents are we doing a eli5 here ? 
  is the general knowledge so low here ? 
  then your title should be : `` happy victory day !, 
  on this day , 72 years ago , the soviet union * ( eurasian socialist state ) * celebrated allied * ( states fighting world war 2 germany , of which the uk , the soviet union , and the united states were a few ) * victory over nazi * ( national socialism , more commonly known as nazism is the ideology and practice associated with the 20th-century german nazi party of which adolf hitler was its leader ) * germany , to which it contributed the most . 
  let us remember the brave men and women who fought , and in many cases , died for this victory . '', 
  :p  tell me what faults you find in my version in no way does the original title discount the meaning of your title . 
  hence it suffices . 
  no where in this thread 's title is everything being attributed to the soviets . 
  you are reading way to much into it . 
  most people recognize it was a concerted effort of which the russians paid the largest price . 
  today we pay our respects to those russians . 
   just because the soviets wanted to manipulate the memory and celebrate alone the us commemorate their fallen in ww2 on their veteran 's day november 11th ( end of ww1 ) and on d-day june 6th . 
  may 8th is not even on their radar . 
  so are the americans manipulating the memory and celebrating alone ? 
  can you read your own link ? 
   is celebrated on 9 may , since the definitive signing occurred after midnight moscow time . 
  you seem to forget that today ** may 9th ** is the day the russians defeated the germans . 
  ** may 8th ** is the day the germans surrendered to the us . 
  both countries were victors over germany . 
  so in no way is the title taking credit for the us accomplishments . 
  huh ? 
  fail logic class much ? 
  you working 80 % of task = russians killing 80 % of german soldiers me working 20 % of task = allies killing 20 % of german soldiers the us was getting wet feet just from the battle of the bulge . 
  a small battle compared to the mega battles of the east front . 
  american desertion rates went up to 6.3 percent . 
  imagine them fighting a stalingrad type battle . 
  must be an murican ? 
  cause europeans typically do n't rattle their titties over venezuela . 
   95 % off the 20 million another history revisionist on reddit . 
  8.7 million russians soldiers died fighting the wehrmacht and luftwaffe .
