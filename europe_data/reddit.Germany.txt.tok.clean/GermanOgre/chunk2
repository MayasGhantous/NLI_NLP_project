  thanks for the kind words / u/landtank -- . 
   the us provides the vast majority of the numbers though , so without australia or new zealand the numbers would n't change much . 
  then he/she can add the data . 
  its two words , but i guess you like half-arsing things . 
   okay , i 'm sure you upvote things that say europe is the `` happiest '' etc , when in reality it 's just people 's opinions and nothing about it is scientific . 
  no i would n't . 
  stop putting words in my mouth . 
  as someone coming from the natural sciences i have a hard time believing that quantifying people 's perception is a good way to measure something . 
  so , do you agree with the paper that the us is 3 times less corrupt then those countries i mentioned ? 
   uh what ? 
  it does , also you 're implying that the us does n't have a social safety net , when it reality it has a very significant one yes i know the us has some safety net . 
  yet comparing it to any of the top of the list is disingenuous . 
   and spends the vast majority of its gdp on those programs . 
  vast majority ? 
  the us pays 19.3 of gdp to social programs . 
  the top european countries between 25 and 30 % . 
  nice try though . 
  https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=socx_agg not only do european pay more gdp for social programs , their programs are more efficient than the ones in the us . 
  healthcare in germany costs around 12 % of gdp , while the us spends 17-18 % with way worse results . 
  i would bet other social programs have similar efficiency rates . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita  paying taxes does not equal generosity ever hear of foreign aid ? 
  it 's taxes spent on fight aids or malaria in africa . 
  here is a list of foreign aid ( oda ) as a percentage of their gross national income : 1 . 
  sweden -- 1.40 % 2 . 
  norway -- 1.05 % 3 . 
  netherlands -- 0.76 % 6 . 
  united kingdom -- 0.71 % 7 . 
  finland -- 0.56 % 8 . 
  switzerland -- 0.52 % 9 . 
  germany -- 0.52 % 10 . 
  france -- 0.37 % 12 . 
  ireland -- 0.36 % 13 . 
  new zealand -- 0.27 % 16 . 
  australia -- 0.27 % 17 . 
  iceland -- 0.24 % 18 . 
  japan -- 0.22 % 19 . 
  italy -- 0.21 % 20 . 
  united states -- 0.17 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_development_aid_country_donors my taxes also go to my religion ( thanks napoleon ) and social programs for the poor just to name a few . 
  the guidelines for social programs like welfare here in germany are federal , unlike , run by the states in the us . 
  try getting massachusetts level of welfare in texas or louisiana . 
  not going to happen . 
  i do n't like some programs that i am paying for here in germany , but i 'd much rather have the safety net and piece of mind that people have somewhat a more equal chance to happiness in life than the us . 
   i see you get your information from reddit i get my information from real sources and can back them up . 
  now its your turn , but i doubt i 'll hear from you again . 
  someone from the netherlands would say that . 
  [ i saw your ballot .

   mean for north america : 7.125 actually this mean is for north american ** australia and new zealand . 
  ** what a farce . 
  according to this , the us is perceived by its citizens , to be 3 times less corrupt then denmark , switzerland and finland ( grey length on bar graph page 20 ) . 
  the answer to the question , if one has friends or family who can care for one , is used as an indicator of a good social net . 
  who made this garbage ranking ? 
  why not give points for a real social net . 
  another trash ranking ( of the 7 total ) is the generosity index . 
  i do n't have to donate as much money here in germany . 
  my taxes do that for me . 
  be it religion , health care or for social services . 
  in the us they have gofundme as their health care provider . 
  of course they need to be more generous .

  and maybe an inkling of how safe rail travel is . 
  care to elaborate with facts ? 
   here 's a 2016 paper this is not a paper . 
  this is a flyer at the most . 
  according to your risk adverse logic wind energy would never have been developed in the eighties and nineties . 
  now wind energy has an eroi rate better than oil . 
  no where in this flyer does it state that investing in research towards renewable powered hydrogen conversion has no merit . 
  same thing they said to those wind turbine dreamers in the 80 's and 90 's . 
  now wind has better eroi rates then oil . 
  not saying it will pan out , but all out denial of its potential is misleading as well . 
  huh ? 
  i thought neither hydrogen nor natural gas can be liquefied at room temperature ( and ambient pressure ) . 
  hydrogen b.p. 
  of -259 \u00b0 c and lng has a b.p. 
  of -162 \u00b0 c. 
  so it 's as efficient as electricity generation from fossil fuels . 
  around 45 % for combined cycle natural gas power plants . 
  typically , smokers do n't affect everyone , while diesel emissions do . 
  there is no way for people living in cities to change their behavior to reduce their exposure to diesel emissions . 
  so not really a valid comparison . 
  welcome to the changing r/europe where facts do n't matter . 
  infants ( usually with preexisting conditions ) and old people die , you are right . 
  not to mention people that have life long breathing and lung problems . 
  but yeah , yay for social security . 
  :-( i wonder if the increased healthcare costs are counterbalanced by the reduced social security costs . 
   blame and punish the whole group for what some members of that group do . 
  that is what isolationists do . 
  letting terrorists win since 1930 's . 
  maybe not in monaco .
