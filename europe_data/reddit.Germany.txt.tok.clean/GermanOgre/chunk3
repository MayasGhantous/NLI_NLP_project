  at least the particulate emissions from gasoline engines are much lower then for diesel . 
  the german government estimates 35000 deaths from particulates and nox per year . 
  got ta say i liked france 's action in mali . 
   accept the drivel that our governments feed us like `` they hate us because of our freedom '' just read some of the rumiyah ( isis magazine ) . 
  looks like establishing shariah law is their main motivation . 
  it 's mentioned in every article . 
  that would be going against and a curtailment of our freedoms , right ? 
   the supposed wave of muslims in the 60s and 70s in germany and france did n't actually happen another falsehood . 
  before 1970 there were ca . 
  300k turks in germany by 1980 about 2 million . 
  : lpb currently there are more turks leaving the country then coming in : https://www.allmystery.de/i/t4d76f9_dwo-ip-zuwanderung-db-aufm.jpg, 
   in the most clear and polite way what part of calling another persons viewpoint as irrelevant is polite ? 
  i must have missed that lesson in grade school . 
   defended my arguments you misconstrued this exchange as an argument . 
  all i pointed out was the irony of your statement . 
  of which there is no doubt . 
  everything else was you talking to yourself . 
  for your rudeness ? 
  no thanks . 
   an irrelevant statement then we are done . 
  good day sir . 
   it 's at least 5-10 times cheaper to host migrants in their neighboring countrys than host them within the eu . 
  you should read about the issue , because it 's pretty simple . 
  i am well aware of the costs . 
  is it fair for jordan to have its population matched by the number of refugees in its borders ? 
   http://www.unhcr.org/575e74567.html so you compare our unhcr donations ? 
  i 'd like to see these in relation to gdp . 
  anyways , the us should be one of the top donors , considering it 's unilateralism caused the most instability with the last 17 years our countries make tremendous profits off of globalization , yet we ca n't show a bit of global solidarity ? 
  i wish we would live in a black and white world . 
  where there are easy answers to complex political questions . 
  these answers tend to sound good at first , but tend to fail under scrutiny . 
  there are still people alive that lived and suffered in those colonies . 
  so this ai n't ancient history . 
   how are they acting as `` spoiled brats '' exactly ? 
  if by your assertion they see themselves as being colonized , then they are acting as brats . 
   do show me the `` irony '' in acknowledging this development . 
  the irony is that these people : moroccans , algerians , bangladeshi , indians and pakistani either descended , or were themselves citizens of french and english colonies/protectorates . 
  now you accuse them of colonizing the original colonizing country . 
  you got ta admit that is ironic . 
  xd france and england made out like bandits from these colonies for hundreds of years . 
  maybe they man up , acknowledge their colonial past and stop acting like spoiled brats . 
   legal immigrants from africa and the mid east settling what is effectively colonies . 
  i do n't understand what you mean with this statement . 
  the immigrants are effectively colonizing france and gb ? 
  i see some irony in that , if that is what you mean . 
  look where on this list france , gb , poland , czech republic , spain are . 
  these are all countries that are doing fairly well , at least better then their position on this list . 
  and i added gb , because this was an issue way before brexit . 
   we could for example ban applications of people who 've crossed the mediterranean we could , if we want to send them back into a war-zone . 
   eu leadership thought that 's too much of an ideological defeat for them to admit . 
  i would say sending people back into a war-zone is a far greater ideological defeat , but that is just my opinion vs. yours . 
   why should any legal authority take that at face value ? 
  they do n't . 
  a country may have a legal obligation to take in refugees based on some treaty they signed . 
  but in reality most countries interpret this treaty not to its fullest extent . 
  just look at asylum seekers per capita for european countries . 
  imo , the main ideological defeat is that some countries in europe are not hosting their share of refugees . 
  http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/db17/production/_88578065_asylum_claims_per_capita_624gr.png if we shut our borders and willfully send back refugees to war zones because they lack proper paperwork , then the words nunca mas are meaningless . 
  i know the rejection of jewish refugee ships by the us before ww2 still haunts many people . 
  on a separate note , a community of ca . 
  550 million that ca n't take in as many refugees ( 1.8 million ) as sudan , pakistan , iraq , turkey and syria ** each individually ** , is sad !, 
  http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-04/refugees-routes-europe-mediterranean-sea by the way , there are good ways of finding out if the asylum applicants are speaking the truth . 
  many government officials use google earth and corroborating testimony from other refugees to weed out untruthfulness . 
  there has n't been a functioning government in some regions in syria for going on 5 years now . 
  some refugees do n't have valid , or any papers , any more . 
  its also hard for governmental work forces to ad hoc have competencies in identifying economic migrants from refugees . 
  they are much better now . 
  of course now the refugee flow is gone . 
  of course had the politicians acting in 2012 when the crisis was in its infancy , a lot of this could headache could have been spared . 
  perhaps we could hire blackwater to cull the tide . 
  actually they do want hungary . 
  it was top asyl application destination per capita in 2015 . http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/db17/production/_88578065_asylum_claims_per_capita_624gr.png, 
  well i think the far right feels the need for validation in their arguments . 
  that is why they are drawn to facebook and reddit . 
  there they can receive a `` moral '' victory by getting upvoted by their own kind . 
  additionally , they can downvote dissenting facts , thus boosting their fragile egos . 
  centrist and left people do n't care enough to downvote and upvote as much . 
  i have never downvoted someone who states facts , which were pertinent to a discussion . 
  even if i violently disagree with them . 
  not every european country has the same process in accepting claims for asylum . 
  some countries severely restrict the total numbers or do n't allocate budgets for asylum services . 
  germany until recently ( 3-4 years ago i think ) had a very restrictive asylum acceptance policy . 
  if all european countries were equally accepting of refugees , the countries on this chart would all have a similar number of asylum claims per capita . 
  there are certainly kurds fleeing the syrian violence . 
  [ according to the bbc 2000 kurds have died in turkey since the crackdown on kurds . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjt0pnkkutsahupkcakhzfcdgkqqqiihcgamaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bbc.com%2fnews%2fworld-europe-39228548&amp;usg=afqjcnhvnyykk7tiidvn8m3j9k0jpekw-q&amp;sig2=uk7ey5h8fgxiswchiigfha )  you are nitpicking and that should n't be allowed . 
  rule of law is a tricky thing . 
  laws should be changed to be more precise , if there is a perceived loophole . 
  wise words from the finnish yoda . 
   i see we have a petty muslim apologist . 
  so he is an apologist for finding a fallacy in your argument ? 
   continues today with the treatment of workers in emirate countries . 
  this is done in some non islam countries as well . 
  look at russia , us and india . 
  does the slave trade still exist in muslim countries today ? 
  probably as much as in other countries . 
  human trafficking is a global problem . 
  this is a typical response of the right when confronted with a statistic showing the drop in the bucket europe is actually doing in assisting the syrian crisis . 
  the next step is to deflect to the costs of them being here without an honest discussion of what the alternatives would be . 
  once you have an honest discussion about the costs , the next deflection will be about crimes commited by foreigners .
