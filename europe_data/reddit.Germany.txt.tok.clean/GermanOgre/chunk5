   i live there . 
  i 'm italian . 
  i figured as much with your name . 
   i shoulda have used / s when i was in ( on ? ), 
  sicily two years ago all the tweeners only ordered these two types of pizza . 
  the popularity of these pizzas are probably quite age specific . 
  we can only hope their tastes will still develop . 
  you obviously have n't been to italy in a while . 
  i 'd rather eat the hawaiian over the very popular [ wurstel/viennese ] ( https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcsqzt07wbo1kmf38jjv5ja9kwihn3rwnrjfzw_ovr609ijmrkqk ) or [ ollandese pizza ] ( https://livelikeanitalian.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pizza-with-french-fries.jpg ) . 
  these are the true crimes of modern cuisine . 
  maybe he was covered under a private insurance plan and not the general plan . 
  the private plans typically require up front payments , which are refunded later . 
   it 's ** spelt ** `` lose '' i see what you did their . 
  we are having tongue roast tonight . 
  on sunday horse for carnival . 
  based on that logic i hope we get the those art pieces back form 80 years ago . 
  then you have n't watched his shows . 
  i guess you prefer the raah raah mindless murica news . 
  stewart actually criticizes both sides and asks critical questions . 
  have you seen that on fox ? 
  before you raise your pitchforks , this article is disingenuous . 
   the domestic nutella not as mellow as the austrian counterpart i am assuming this article is referring to the viscosity when using the word mellow . 
  well the viscosity varies from country to country ( region to region ) in europe . 
  here is a video comparing nutella from germany and france ( originally from arte ) . 
  it 's more likely that you guys use a recipe for nutella from italy/france . 
  https://youtu.be/cxp2mtwnoz4 if food quality is indeed a problem , then this example is pretty bad . 
  i 'd like to see the testing by the testers and the feedback by the food makers ( if they had been contacted ) . 
  what do the ingredient percentages say ? 
   then you guys should fix your platform from inside and remove assholes . 
  you know these are n't military organisations where membership is controlled . 
  anyone can join the protests , espouse rhetoric and do violence in the name of these platforms . 
  this is the unfortunately the dark side of democracy . 
  it is our job , as the informed citizenry , to understand that radical elements will try and pervert these platforms to their own use . 
  typically the core members of these platforms distance themselves from the radical elements , yet those news do n't make headlines . 
   you guys as you can see they have succeeded in dividing us . 
  we are people with the same goals . 
  :( to quote an old american statesmen thomas jefferson : * an informed citizenship is the only true repositroy of public will . 
  your letting the few people trying to get attention through radical statements divide us . 
  if you look at the core of the feminist and other social justice movements , it is about equality and freedom of speech/assembly . 
  just because someone tries to hijack that message through a radical statements does n't negate its core . 
  the core of the feminist movements is equal pay for equal work , equal representation , etc. 
  if we let each shiny trump or some feminazi statement divide us , then we have lost . 
  by the way national tv means nothing . 
  they put all kinds of shit on here in germany . 
  makes me almost miss the us pbs system . 
   and the platform sucks . 
  as with any platform it represents the issues and concerns of its members . 
  i do n't know why the platform sucks . 
  it worked wonders for gay rights in the last 20 to 30 years . 
   it 's tall pyramid every organisation has some sort of pyramid shape with low effort/time members at the bottom and leaders at the top . 
   it 'd take a shitload of work to override this . 
  so does any major societal change . 
   working for a platform that i do n't agree with why do you not agree with them ? 
  they are fighting for the same rights you are ? 
  equality and freedom of speech . 
  the platform is out there . 
  why not join it and use it for one 's fight for true equality . 
  in my opinion there is a still a social stigma against men who protest the gender roles forced upon them by society . 
  until enough men are men enough ( hate to use that idiom ) to use a protest platform , the status quo will stay . 
  this is clearly true for `` free '' media . 
  every news source has some editorial biases , but if you look at the mass of journalistic work done by the sources actually spending money on hard journalism , you will see that it generally is quite fair . 
  trump is the leader of nato ? 
  or are we talking about another idiot ? 
   tired of having their heads bored with all the feminism , racism and social justice . 
   but that doesnt change the fact that this is how a lot of young men feel . 
  abandoned by society . 
  then why do they feel bored by social justice ? 
  why do n't they join the fight for these issues . 
  reducing and fighting against gender roles is a worthy social justice platform that should be embraced by both sexes . 
  as to point 3 , according to one study the generation z is much more likely to believe in fake news . 
  http://www.upi.com/top_news/us/2016/11/23/study-shows-young-people-more-likely-to-believe-fake-news/6881479933768/ i doubt there are more people seeing the big picture then people did 30 years ago . 
  back then you could subscribe to a `` big '' picture newspaper or magazine with well written and more balanced articles . 
  today people expect this kind of journalism from their free internet content and are definitely not getting it . 
  i guess you are right at no time period was any part of arabia better then europe . 
   i did n't say they were on par with china or the middle east . 
  sorry got my replies messed up . 
   7 centuries . 
  it 's a serie of up and down obviously its an up and down and there were atrocities on both sides . 
  but from what little i read about it , it seemed more modern and open minded on the moor 's side . 
   pierre rich\u00e9 , r\u00e9gine pernoud , more recently dominique barth\u00e9l\u00e9my . 
  i am no historian , nor have i got access to a scholarly database , but googling all those names with islam only brings up french results if any at all . 
  please find a scholar that says europe was on par with the middle east and china before the 13th century . 
  you and your facts !, 
  please give a citation or link then . 
  i would like to see the scholar who says that europe was on par with china or the middle east prior to the 12th century . 
   resist being conquered and eventually launch a counter-offensive if by counter offensive you mean the invading hordes leaving by their own free will due to their leader dying . 
  ok . maybe that is the french post napoleonic definition of this term . 
  :p [ so no colonialist statues ? 
  have you been to europe ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/monument_a_colom%2c_barcelona%2c_spain_-_jan_07.jpg/330px-monument_a_colom%2c_barcelona%2c_spain_-_jan_07.jpg )  while europeans cry and apologise profusely about how evil we were for colonialism . 
  why is this ? 
  i do n't know , maybe because the people are still alive who lived and were robbed in the former colonies . 
  europe was considered less civilized then to both china and , to a lesser extent , the islamic world until the 13th century . 
  then the ghengis khan came and played the great equalizer . 
  i 'm sure that historians see it that way , 
  woohoo , they conquered people 1000 years behind them in the development . 
  last time i looked at a globe spain had a geographical propensity to discovering and conquering the new world first . 
  overall , scholars agree that until the 13th-14th century the chinese followed by the islamic world were significantly ahead of europe socially , economically and culturally . 
  and your point is ? 
  opinions ?
