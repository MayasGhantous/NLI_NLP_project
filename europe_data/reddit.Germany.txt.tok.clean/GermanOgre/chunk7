  i identify as american/german i have lived in both countries equally . 
  how would you identify yourself as a person with american and german parents . 
  who grew up in both countries and never encountered the european culture of his american parent . 
  which american identifies himself as swedish or whatever ? 
  talking at evening/night with a russian man from down the street . 
  i live in a town of about 12,000 . 
  do n't know how we got into politics , since i am half american , so i generally avoid the topic over here . 
   i do n't think that the russian government is as evil i am in the same boat . 
  i tend to think less in black in white . 
  usually things happen due to many factors and figuring out these factors requires discussion and an open mind . 
  to be honest i did n't even bring up stalin . 
  as a response to his carte blanche for putin i mentioned the secret purges done by the government and the extreme secrecy of the soviet leaders in later times . 
  this guy was very pro putin , painting him as a saint . 
  there was no doubt about putin in his mind . 
  this reminds of similar sentiment i saw in the us before and during the invasion of iraq . 
  a blinders on , total commitment to the war effort without consideration to other opinions or even discussing them . 
  i do n't trust the german government or any government for that matter . 
  this guy non nonchalantly said he trusts the russian government and their policies . 
  what would be your way of discussing the matter with him ? 
  or do you trust the russian government ?

  some people like to generalize and make policy based on the actions of very few extremists . 
  shock jock knee-jerk politics . 
  it has worked well for israel in the past . 
  maybe it will be good for europe as well . 
  unfortunately diplomacy is not in the republican 's vocabulary any more . 
  all the right wingers say it never works and has no place in today 's politics . 
  so no help from the american 's on the diplomatic front . 
  that leaves it up to the europeans who are pretty fractured themselves to use diplomacy . 
  i agree with you . 
  but i can see where having 0 economic worries in addition to living up to * western * living standards could be worth yearning for . 
  what would the results of such a poll be in the netherlands ? 
  bff !, 
  why ? 
  some things were definitely better back then for them . 
  20 % would be half the ex gdr 's population . 
  not the ratio i have seen when visiting relatives there . 
  i live in a large rural russian enclave here . 
  ( quite a few novelty plates with ru ) . 
  a russian down the block was defending russia policies ( putin , crimea , etc. ), 
  and saying he trusts the government . 
  when i asked how we can have so much faith given the past ( stalinist purges , etc. ), 
  he just gave me a blank look and walked away . 
  not that i agree , but it sounds like this is a perfect response to trump 's statement of treating putin and merkel the same . 
   unfortunately not , just some quick examples :     http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/griechenland-frontex-mission-deutsche-kontrollieren-grenze-zu-mazedonien-a-1132662.html  this article is talking about unprocessed migrants in greece camps . 
  who knows if they are migrants or refugees . 
  how is the journalist to know what they are . 
    https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article161740112/schutzstatus-entzug-ist-in-deutschland-nur-ausnahme.html   here the article mentions migrants once . 
  since the whole article is only about refugees ( mentioned 22 times ) , i do n't see this as a serious problem . 
    http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ungarn-orbn-will-schutzhaft-fuer-fluechtlinge-1.3332199 again the article mentions migrant ** once ** in context with a statement from the hungarian president . 
  probably due to the president using the word . 
  the article uses the word refugee 24 times and makes it clear they are talking about refugees . 
  do n't know if this collection would warrant being called fake news . 
  thanks for the downvote :p, 
  i ca n't and is against this subreddit 's guidelines to post non english links without english translation . 
  just saying . 
   because germany accusing denmark of not being to integrate our mena population is fucking rich . 
  you said it yourself . 
  smh - paraphrase your comment : your country has only costs associated with them being in denmark . 
   which is why they top lists of the most criminal diaspora and the list of the biggest welfare recipients . 
  wow what an astute observation considering they are by far the largest immigrant population ( 1.6 million next poles with 600k ) . 
  and if you are referring to per 100,000 basis , then that is a ** lie ** as well : https://img.pr0gramm.com/2016/01/26/d555b2d7df321868.jpg shows ** clearly ** that turks are on par with other european countries ( poland , france , italy , spain ) in the likelihood of committing nonviolent crimes in germany . 
  for violent crimes they are not even in the top ten . 
   arguing with you is just really sad . 
  cheer up mate . 
  life 's to short to be sad . 
   you got some real fucking nerve , germanbro . 
   begone back to your glass house . 
  hmm please take a chill pill . 
  i was just responding to your analysis : * i know for sure that in denmark this multicultural experiment has costed us several hundred billions . 
  * i do n't understand the glass house reference , but ohhhhh kay . 
   funnily enough , this is something your government specifically hides . 
  among the swedes as well . 
  it 's more that its a complicated issue , requiring thought , interpolation of trends into the future and a comprehensive study . 
  did you know in germany there will be twice as many retirees in 2060 with 10-15 million less population ? 
  i wonder if in the long run immigrants would not be a boon to us . 
   shout-out to collogne . 
  i 'd rather give a shout out to my turkish neighbors and colleagues . 
  2 million strong and fairly well integrated . 
  helping make this country great . 
   both schr\u00f6der and merkel worked hard to hide some unemployed people  could be . 
  i was n't here then . 
  i just know that a lot of refugees from the center here in town have jobs . 
  these are typically jobs germans do n't want ( kitchen work , heavy labor , etc. ), 
   anyway , to my knowledge the fields which lack suitable employees are high skill labor . 
  unfortunately , not what i have seen where i work . 
  of course this is anecdotal . 
   and another thing : i really really dislike that politicians as well as media use the term refugee and migrant interchangably . 
  is n't this mainly a reddit problem ? 
  i have n't seen politicians or media make this mistake that much . 
   they make up about half ( look it up at the bamf if you want ) . 
  sorry 37 % instead of 27 % had it wrong in my head . 
  still coincides with the amount of refugees from warring countries . 
   the first is the assumption that everyone comes from the syrian/isis conflict . 
  they make up about half i see 66 % for afghanistan , iraq and syria . 
  i would put taliban in same category as isis . 
   as a sidenote , see that ! 430.000 !, 
  asylum requests are n't processed yet . 
  well there was a proverbial storm on the government . 
  at least there is end in sight .
