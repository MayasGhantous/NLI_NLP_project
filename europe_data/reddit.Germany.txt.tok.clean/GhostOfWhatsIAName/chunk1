no , just exaggerating . 
  though , it depends on your point of view - if you 're 60 , i 'm probably young . 
  i just read that as well . 
  and he ( re - ) introduced it when he came into office . 
  well , of course . 
  proudly , yes !, 
  oh that 's why . 
  we do n't do that in humour because we always mean it . 
  you know , all the laments about how bad things are here . 
  taking it to another level . 
  there must be a way we can halve that . 
  i do . 
  is that a joke or true ? 
  * edit : seems [ to be true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5oxlib9rck ) *, 
  this shit is getting worse than the cold war . 
  it will always hit the people who are in the worst situation already . 
  unfortunately that tends to fuel nationalism and the support for expansion . 
  why do humans in 2014 still have to ** fight ** * one another * over land * ( and of course all that is connected to it ) * . 
  if it comes off like that , then so be it . 
  local and personal circumstances matter , yes . 
  and i understand that they are there . 
  but nowadays we 're having way too many excuses for things we do and do n't . 
  i wo n't ever excuse myself the lazy way saying that my vote does n't count or help anything . 
  if everybody on this planet spares one plastic bag today , that would be 8 billion less . 
  if everybody says their plastic bag wo n't matter a bit , that 's a big pile of non-degradable waste . 
  i understand that not everybody has the resources to spare one though . 
  sorry , not wanting to alienate anyone or sound moralistic . 
  better now ? 
  hey i 've thrown around dunning kruger quite a bit in here already . 
  my comment was n't properly thought through though , i think . 
   and cut the moralistic crap and the threats , you are alienating people . 
  what exactly do you mean ? 
  i was n't going to mention that ... 
  i believe a blank is invalid in germany . 
  i 'd have to check back though . 
  but with about 24 choices there should be someone close to one 's preference or secure to vote in protest . 
  oh okay , yeah , a little disclaimer should be added . 
  oh man , do n't remind me of that stuff . 
  [ perfect description . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunning%e2%80%93kruger_effect ), 
  you are seriously underestimating the [ dunning-kruger-effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunning%e2%80%93kruger_effect ), 
  we may have 99 seats . 
  but that 's because of our 80 million citizens . 
  france has 74 , italy and the uk 73 . 
  we 're outnumbered already . 
  and each one of those seats carries one vote in ep decisions . 
  i do n't see how we would rule shit in the parliament . 
  that 's exactly why you * should * vote . 
  side note : [ bigger countries have more seats overall , but smaller ones have more seats per inhabitant . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_in_the_european_parliament#2014_amendment ) degressive proportionality . 
  there 's never enough educating the populace going to happen if the populace is not going to vote . 
  of course we should n't stop at voting . 
  but it must be part of it . 
  part of educating the people around you to use that right . 
  see , i never tell anybody who to vote for . 
  just go out and do it . 
  it 's your civil right . 
  use it . 
  especially in the ep . 
  you could still x the next best thing . 
  haha , yeah !, 
  upvote for visibility anyways . 
  report it to the [ ep election observation ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/intcoop/election_observation/contact_en.htm ) . 
  they wo n't be too happy about it . 
  well , i have . 
  because i ca n't stand such shit . 
  well , tell the eu to look into that , i ca n't imagine election observers being too happy about that . 
  vote by mail ? 
  i did , because i wo n't be around on sunday . 
  i totally forgot how you came and invaded my country under that little guy , france !, 
  and then the swedes had to come and save us . 
  i am sorry . 
  though in this case , not really . 
  now that is an extremely sad list of choices . 
  i 'd probably vote for the gymnast as well . 
  because i 'm a bit too much into democracy and * trying * to influence politics by my vote . 
  it 's easier to back down from the majority than a dictator . 
  that 's sad . 
  exactly why we have to vote for those who seem to oppose lobbyist laws . 
  it 's developing in europe . 
  and we 're not immune to those . 
  i think you 're generalizing a bit there . 
  what my forefathers and their countrymen did in europe was extremely horrible . 
  but that does n't mean you would have to show gratitude and hand your country on a silver platter by voting . 
  you will do so by not voting . 
  especially if you do n't want europe unified you should go vote for those who want to keep sovereignty of member countries . 
  okay , let 's clean up some misunderstandings here :  nobody has the right to just randomly move between countries eu : directive 2004/38/ec on the right to move and reside freely any citizen of the eu may move and reside anywhere in the eu freely . 
   balkan eu member states in the `` balkan '' area : greece , bulgaria , croatia , romania , slovenia member candidates : most of the rest . 
   eritrea did you actually pick eritrea as an example for asylum seekers we should not tolerate ? 
  this speaks volumes , actually . 
  [ eritrea is a fucking shithole in terms of human rights violations . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_eritrea ) people probably prefer drowning in the mediterranian over going back there , when they make the decision to move out . 
   are you trying to make me sound like some fascist who does n't value the justice system we have ? 
  no i 'm just saying that finding out , getting them to court and convicting them will take a while , let alone deporting them afterwards . 
  that 's why this is a justice system , it has a few ways to make sure it 's actually justice . 
  your second paragraph , well ... i for one would n't call other humans violent animals . 
  because a ) they 're humans and b ) you may be insulting the animals . 
   this warrants immediate deportation lol , because we immediately know who did what to whom and why . 
  that 's not how the justice system works nor how the residence permit system works . 
  that 's not how any of this works .
