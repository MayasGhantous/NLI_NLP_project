  looks like iceland needs some cialis . 
  you put 1800 people in a space for 1200 and mix all ethnicities and religions , there will be one provoking the other by destroying their holy book and a rage fit from the others . 
  this is not about `` asylum seekers '' and limiting their numbers it is about managing them timely . 
  but he told them , he was n't drunk !, 
  do n't bring my hopes up . 
   ursula von der leyen that is not going to work . 
  what reputation ? 
  bad blatant propaganda . 
  and no , my german friends , tsipras is n't the one to offer a deal . 
  we should give them a chance at helpful reform without crippling their economy . 
  we 're sitting on our high horse acting like they would n't want our help when they 're just saying they 'd rather shoot themselves than accept us tying them up before shooting them . 
  it 's not that greece does not want help . 
  it 's the crippling conditions they do n't want with that help . 
  it 's getting more and more stupid but i do n't see any quote about a 24 hour ultimatum ? 
  i 've stopped listening to all this political yik-yakking , populism from all sides . 
  right now i 'm more curious about how the [ indiegogo greek bailout fund ] ( https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/greek-bailout-fund ) turns out than anything . 
  it 's an interesting sign of solidarity with the greek people , whatever that 's worth . 
  this also tells me to just keep buying [ cretan olive oil ] ( http://www.latzimasoil.gr/images/products/evoo_latzimas_organic/01.jpg ) like recently . 
  that right there 's really a surprisingly delicious product for a decent price . 
  good luck to all of greece for the next few days and to all of europe as well . 
  btw it 's really sad the role my own government played in pushing hellas into the bailout back in 2010 with an already unsustainble debt . 
  that was a giant mistake all of europe now has to live with . 
  and we just keep on pushing on . 
  cut that debt and restructure so we can all gain some stability back , we 're not going to see the money back anyways . 
  are you telling me the explanation armin showed me years back was wrong and it 's time to redo [ this story ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_kld9opgfg ) die maus never explains things wrong !, 
  the english is fine . 
  pfff , hahaha , ` election ' , hahaha , ` wins ' . 
  ha , lol . 
  i remember how the adults used to `` re-elect '' our representatives in the gdr with 99 pct at 97 pct participation . 
  yep , totally legit that result . 
  what does that have to do with lebedev owning the independent and having been a kgb official ? 
  haha , lol , alright , yeah , russia . 
  ( the laughing is at the joke this has become . 
  those alleged threats are so old by now , who gives a shit anymore ? 
  and also , it was some ` generals ' who probably have the definite last word when it comes to nuking anything anywhere . 
  right . 
  not going to take this overdrawn crap serious anymore , just the small , obvious parts like that russia is threatening the baltics . ), 
  but , what does that mean ? 
  what 's the conclusion you draw from this ? 
  lebedev is the long arm of some people in power who try to defame the current russian gov ' t or what ? 
  baed ? 
  indeks ? 
  i 'll pick these words up into my english and german immediately . 
  true . 
  i was also only semi-serious . 
  it was just a bit irritating with a bit of background in russian as a foreign language from school . 
  man make up your mind , i ca n't even read past the first word with that mix of letters . 
  someone should turn this into a comic . 
  well based on some [ theories of russian history and the founding of the kievan rus , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rus%27_people ) they are * technically * correct . 
  ( also , the burn on brazil in the third one , holy smokes ... ), 
  that wine is not from jewrope . 
  still , if you give a bunch of monkeys typewriters ... 
  not you , you were not stereotyping . 
  i was rather trying to point out the essence of your comment . 
  it never helped to stereotype anything into any direction . 
  [ we are not at all at the limit ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesellschaftstaat/einkommenkonsumlebensbedingungen/wohnen/tabellen/wohnungsbestand.html ) [ of space for people , we 're just unable to make use of it appropriately . 
  for years i 've seen her very critical for not really defining a position but just playing to some interests . 
  there was n't a real choice beside her , but she never was mine . 
  this determined stance on the refugee situation really impresses me . 
  she may actually win some real , bad weather support with this . 
  to me it 's good to see we have one last figure of integrity that wo n't bow to the rushed prejudice of personal insecurity all around . 
  people have been living way above their own limits here for years and now they 're feeling a fear of insecurity . 
  there are deep rooted problems causing the insecurities of the current situation , like our reliance on short-term and underpaid work , that have nothing to do with refugee influx but could actually be helped by it . 
  but all we 're ever presented are short sighted imaginations of catastrophe . 
  and even gauck 's statement , that `` what should now grow together has so far not belonged together '' , is disputable . 
  there are several things that belong together , written in several documents internationally , foremost the [ un charter , ] ( http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/preamble/index.html ) which are at play here . 
  the peoples of the world , the un and europe , [ among those e.u. 
  countries , syria , iran , iraq , afghanistan , russia , the us and so on . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_the_united_nations#current_members ) if you like it or not , we 've all declared we belong together as humans , - to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours , and - to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security , and - to ensure , by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods , that armed force shall not be used , save in the common interest , and - to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples . 
  we need a strong reminder of this , all together . 
  and the current situation is one , a challenging one , but not an impossible one . 
  this is really a bit one-sided , we 're coming away much too welcoming in this . 
  he does n't even suggest so . 
  hey guys , in the name of daimler , thanks a lot for sales going through the roof in the 2nd half of 2016 . 
  let 's see how long it takes for her to end up in jail .

  `` but we need to save all the jobs in the coal industry ! '', 
  - regional government of saxony , germany, 
  actually , no . 
  that is what happens when you cling to the dying coal industry for dear life of some moribund jobs that ca n't possibly be secured for more than half a decade . 
  because that 's what 's still going on here in saxony . 
  and it 's brown coal of all , the worst in pollution and energy density . 
  we 're still number one in lignite production worldwide as of 2014 with double of what 2nd place usa produced . 
  [ ** top ten brown coal producers ( 2014e ) ** ] ( http://www.worldcoal.org/file_validate.php?file=coal%20facts%202015.pdf ) germany 178.2 mt united states 72.1 mt russian federation 69.6 mt poland 63.9 mt turkey 61.5 e mt australia 60.7 mt greece 48.0 mt india 47.2 mt czech republic 38.2 mt bulgaria 31.2 mt,

  it 's election time . 
  and i urge you all my fellow europeans to make use of your vote to elect members of the european parliament !, 
  the uk and netherlands started off today , but the rest of us have time to go . 
  i for my part like diversity and democracy on my continent and thus prefer high voter turnout , no matter whatever you vote for . 
  just make sure you do it .

  ) * here 's how you do it : www.elections2014.eu * sorry for the caps , at least i got your attention .
