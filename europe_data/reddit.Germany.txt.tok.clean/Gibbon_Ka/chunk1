  try to post that question in / r/cologne or read one of the dozen threads covering that subject over there . 
  have fun !, 
  poor little denmark seems to be so swedish already that you replaced them in the list, 
  east germany had . 
  edit : the deleted comment asked `` where does germany have state-enforced atheism ? '', 
  fellow german , i have n't tipped much as a student while money was tight . 
  but now i always tip at restaurants , cafes , taxi drivers , delivery guys or the barbers . 
  service personell basically and round about 10 % of the price . 
  i have n't observed that to be unusual . 
  bayer leverkusen , not bayern . 
  ftfy, 
  no , these are separate issues . 
  but they come to the surface again because deutsche bank is pretty much involved in everything . 
  it 's just another angle . 
  explain what ? 
  words like al-gebra , al-gorithm , al-chemy , al-kali or even al-cohol clearly show how anti-science the arabic world was and is . 
  afraid of the competition ? 
  is war the only reason you allow for fleeing one 's country ? 
  and would you kindly define `` a lot '' a bit more ? 
  like 60 % a lot ? 
  edit : spelling, 
  you 're ignorant . 
  we got it the first time . 
  totally not my country , but it 's beautiful : welcome to georgia , racha - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupfxqehomo,

  it 's the first sentence ... 
  the median age of germans in 2013 was : 44.5 years for men 46.8 years for women source : http://www.bib-demografie.de/shareddocs/glossareintraege/de/m/medianalter.html ( in german ),

  sounds like bullshit to me . 
  was it ? 
  how so ? 
  so if a question is kept simple the answer has to be simple too ? 
  what is the meaning of life ? 
  what is your purpose in life ? 
  why have the netherlands never won the world cup ? 
  my point ? 
  simple answers to complex , multi-layered questions do not help anyone . 
  they only let you look foolish . 
  who 's responsible for the economic crash of portugal in the last let 's say ~ 8 years ? 
  a little heads up : you 're victim of a false friend there . 
  you mean pension not rent . 
  rent is actually miete in german not rente . 
  can i just take this moment to thank you for your service ? 
  o7 the amount of jimmies you rustle on a daily basis ( mine included ) must be spectacular . 
  well done , you magnificent bastard !, 
  do we now ? 
  i 'd argue that the kids in sudanese quoran schools , the inhabitants of a bombed and fought over lybian city , an elderly man in the westbank , a shepherd of the pakistani mountains or an egyptian farmer do neither have steady internet access nor regular exchange with other cultures . 
  hate breeds easy where ` the other ' is only an abstract concept , the situation is dire and the ways to information and knowledge are rough . 
  take my country f.e. 
  neonazis are most common in parts of eastern germany . 
  in the places where you 'll find the least foreigners and the highest unemployment rates . 
  i guess it 's easy to hate and do fucked up shit if you see no perspective for yourself or your children . 
  the smugness of the author made that really hard to read . 
  otherwise indeed , good news . 
  sure .

  this is the 9th time the catholic church is taking legal action against the titanic .

  maybe the pope should n't be so pissed ... 
  like what ? 
  drinking alcohol on the street ? 
  criminalization of recreational/soft drug use ? 
  availability of welfare and healthcare ? 
  yeah , europe really had to abandon a lot on their road to safety . 
  i do n't think so . 
  to me , gwb is really , really stupid . 
  but he stems from an influental family , has all the right connections and those that want influence in politics love him - because he is easy to influence . 
  but this is [ / r/europe ] ( / r/europe ) . 
  to hell with those lunatics in the west . 
   as dumb as you and me i do n't believe that ending up in political power means you are a smart person . 
  i refuse to acknowledge roland koch was anything but a sellout whore . 
  i believe that there a many politicians across all parties that genuinley want to do the best ( they can ) for their region and their country . 
  i 'd never say they are all stupid . 
  there are some incredibly smart ones even . 
  but they are not all the creme de la creme . 
  i just took offense at the premise that those that are voted are  generally smarter than the voters who put them there . 
  randomb0y is putting way too much trust in his elected officials there . 
   generally smarter than the voters uhhh , i wish . 
  i believe your average politician is as dumb as you and me . 
  he just fakes knowledge better and has a stronger drive to power . 
  since the uk is able to compete as england , scotland , wales and northern island ( at least in football ) , i think there 'll be some workaround for that . 
   * to put your mind at ease , a translation from a german document i found at [ http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/archive/policy/consult/ebs_de.pdf] ( http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/archive/policy/consult/ebs_de.pdf ) ( page 3 ) : `` the first foreign language in europe is en : 32.6 % of europeans state english as their second language . 
  [ ... ] the second foreign language in europe is fr ( 9.5 % ) . 
  in uk , ireland and luxembourg french is the first foreign language . 
  [ ... ] in 3rd and 4th place are d ( 4.2 % ) and es ( 1.5 % ) '' the figures are from 2000 , so a bit dated . 
  but i think we can safely assume that there has n't been too much of a drastic change in the numbers since then ? 
  i mean english had a solid 23.1 % lead on french in terms of first foreign language . 
  and the overall number of english speakers seems to have risen from 40.5 % to 51 % . 
  ok . you are right and you are nitpicking . 
  could you elaborate on why it is important ? 
  more then half of the people in the eu ( claim to ) speak english . 
  more than any other language . 
  which makes it the de facto lingua franca . 
  no one cares if anyone picked it up as 2nd , 3rd or 4th language . 
  and my guess is , since english is most probably the foreign language taught first at most european schools , it 's also the most spoken 2nd language . 
  at least that 's my crude logic . 
  ( fyi : i did n't downvote you ),
