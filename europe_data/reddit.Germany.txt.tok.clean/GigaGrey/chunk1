anyone else out there also thinking that something important like independence should require a 2/3rds majority ? 
  thanks !, 
  removed the reference . 
  something is leaking . 
  not that i am complaining , had a good chuckle . 
  i think he is talking about counter-strike . 
  in real life the aks are more of a sub minute-of-man rifle , and not sub-moa ... 
  with the ak-74 they switched to 5.54 x39mm , which has less energy than 5.56 x45mm , so `` better penetration/energy '' is out . 
  those events were not even all-out wars . 
  of course you struggle if you do not want to kill civilians . 
  that has to be a serious justified interest . 
  i do n't think that `` i want other people to live in that home who are not related with me '' is not a justified reason . 
  really that wrong ?

   if companies can be people , municipalities can be too . 
  well , in germany it is not . 
  if your flat is not owned by a person they basically ca n't throw you out if you pay your rent and do n't do anything crazy stupid . 
  the so called `` own need '' termination is only available when you need the flat/house for a family member or yourself . 
  that would be donating man power . 
  they have no authority and have to act as helpers for the organisations they are assigned to , the [ thw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technisches_hilfswerk ) for example . 
  the only time the bundeswehr is used in germany is by donating manpower without authority to other organisations during floods . 
  `` on their own '' they would only be used in times of crisis and to protect the liberty and order of the state . 
  and a flood of refugees does not constitute a crisis . 
  the bundespolizei being on the border would be a normal thing - they now also contain the old bundesgrenzschutz . 
  are you sure that it was not bundespolizei ? 
  because the latter is not allowed for policing actions , as far as i know . 
   bundesl\u00e4nder ... austria and switzerland anschluss 2.0 , yay . 
  `` it 's too easy to blame feminism for our troubles . '', 
  is literally what they usually say . 
  you do n't have to go that far out . 
  [ there is a lot of space close to munich ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xo3wdzn.jpg ) that can be used for ... refugee camps . 
  it brings a tear to my eye that the french supposedly think of germany as best friends ... while austria is still their old arch enemy . 
  to be fair , bavaria only started to pay like 30 years ago . 
  they received a lot of money before that from the other states . 
  hallo !, 
  hallo sieee !, 
  they are usually smaller and quite shady companies that specialize on tracking ips for law firms that themselves specialize in writing so called abmahnungen , which are basically cease and desist letters in which they also demand payment for their lawyers and a penalty , which usually adds up to 500-1000 $ . 
  that has not really anything to do with your isp , but with companies tracking the ips that upload stuff through torrent . 
  they then go to a court and demand that the court orders your isp to give them the name and address of the owner of that specific ip at that moment in time . 
  important thing : they get you for uploading , not for downloading . 
  we do n't have cable in karlsfeld . 
  but the telekom recently upgraded their network and put a nice and shiny grey dslam right in front of my home . 
  100 down and 40 up now , for 40 $ . 
  meanwhile , i paid 40 $ for 15 down and 1 up 10km away from munich , germany . 
  afaik they are using zte at the moment . 
  and probably huawei . 
  eplus network is total chaos . 
  not looking forward to the merging with telefonica . 
  tough luck . 
  telekom also has a considerable amount of huawei . 
  still some nsn in there ... not sure how long , though . 
  because they are seriously fucking up with the switch from netact version 5 to version 8 ... 
  lol , no . 
  half of the core network of telefonica germany consists of huawei switches , as well as the complete south of the base stations . 
  they do n't need your phone to spy on you , they could simply go to the source . 
  well , france has some lying around at the moment , so they will probably be cheap . 
  pay the pirates more . 
  [ from google.de ] ( http://i.imgur.com/roqlere.jpg ) why is france ... * an industrial country * a victory power of ww2 * a terror target * so gay, 
  i feel your pain . 
  we are the millers . 
  the first trials have begun as far as i heard on the radio , and they are against thieves and pickpockets whose victims could immediately alert the police and follow them with the officers . 
  edit : [ the first one has been sentenced today for pickpocketing , 6 months probation and a fine . 
  ] ( http://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/rheinland/prozessauftakt-silvester-koeln-100.html ) although the fine will not be really much since it is measured after your income and lifestyle . 
  but he now has a permanent criminal record . 
  [ it is short for the dublin regulations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) . 
  quality of life is good , but there have been no real hikes in salaries , at all . 
  for example : from 2000 to 2008 the salary increase in germany was on average at about 1,83 % . 
  with a target inflation of 2 % and an overall increase of productivity of 1,5 % at least 3,5 % increase per year in salaries would have been needed . 
  [ source ... in german , page 7 . 
  ] ( http://www.weltderarbeit.de/start341.pdf ) in regard to a living wage - apprenticeships are a big thing here in germany . 
  if you get hired by a big company , chances are you will start with about 40.000 $ , but if you are working for smaller companies you can probably calculate with ~ 30.000 . 
  multiply that by ~ 0.6 and you have what is left over after taxes and social security . 
  depending where and how you live it can be perfectly fine , or horrible . 
   i really am curious why gustav adolf chose a german phrase . 
  at breitenfeld , for example , his army consisted of nearly 50 % saxons . 
  [ the motto itself supposedly originated in the late west and east roman empires . 
  on which was to read , that the people had lost the trust of the government and it could only by doubled efforts be regained . 
  would it not be easier , if the government just disbanded the people and elected another ? 
  edit : the poem `` die l\u00f6sung '' , the solution , by bertolt brecht . 
  inspired by the [ workers uprising in the german democratic republic of 17.06.1953 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uprising_of_1953_in_east_germany ) . 
  it is missing a few lines at the start :  nach dem aufstand des 17 . 
  juni  lie\u00df der sekret\u00e4r des schriftstellerverbands  in der stalinallee flugbl\u00e4tter verteilen after the uprising of june the 17th the secretary of the writers association let leaflets be dispersed in the stalinallee, 
  why would anyone want to live in berlin ? 
  there is no work to be had , and the rich do n't really want to live there , either . 
  yes , you can only ever do one thing at a time . 
  right . 
  sorry , had forgotten that . 
   most people only see the shouting minority you know what most people also see ? 
  `` mainstream '' feminists not speaking out against the extremists . 
  i have not yet seen any refugees in my town . 
  but i guess our government is still too pc to build camps near dachau . 
  the euro came in 2002 , and not 1998 . 
  and i misclicked once and send a person with parenting problems to the einwohnermeldeamt . 
  yay , i can stay german . 
  nobody really needs to invade poland . 
  force of habit , i guess ... 
  also known as `` marrying your grand daughter and your grand-grand-daughter . '', 
  edit : wow . 
  it is actually his grand-grand-daughter daughter . 
   the sa80 was infamously unreliable during its a1 phrase but it seems much improved now the british military have the a2 funnily enough , the a2 improvements were made by h&k . ,
