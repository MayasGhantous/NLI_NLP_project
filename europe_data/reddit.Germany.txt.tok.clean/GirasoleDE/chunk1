reading this reminded me of an old saying :  [ the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable . 
   ... `` no debt relief without reform '' ... jeffrey sachs :  ... greece and germany need to come to a rapprochement soon after the referendum and agree to a package of economic reforms and debt relief . 
  no country -- including greece -- should expect to be offered debt relief on a silver platter ; relief must be earned and justified by real reforms that restore growth , to the benefit of both debtor and creditor . 
  and yet , a corpse can not carry out reforms . 
  that is why debt relief and reforms must be offered together , not reforms `` first '' with some vague promises that debt relief will come in some unspecified amount at some unspecified time in the future ( as some in europe have said to greece ) . 
   to be sure , in the greek debacle , both sides have made countless mistakes , misjudgments , and misdeeds over the last decade , and even before . 
  a country does not reach greece 's parlous state without a generation of egregious mismanagement . 
  but nor does a country go bankrupt without serious mistakes by its creditors -- first in lending too much money , and then in demanding excessive repayments to the point of the debtor 's collapse . 
  with both sides at fault , it is important for them not to lose the future by squabbling endlessly over the past . 
   greek finance minister yanis varoufakis said in a blog post the imf had upheld the syriza party government 's contention for the last five months that debt relief should be at the center of the negotiations . 
   [ `` puzzlingly , all this fine research by the good people at the imf suddenly evaporates when imf functionaries coalesce with their ecb and the european commission colleagues in order to impose upon our government their chosen policies , '' he wrote . 
  ] ( http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/03/imf-backs-ever-so-peculiarly-the-syriza-governments-debt-assessment/ )  the imf argues that greece 's debt burden of nearly 185 percent of gross domestic product can only be made sustainable if the euro zone provides considerable extra financing through a mixture of new loans and a debt restructuring . 
   this is politically anathema in germany , the biggest creditor country , and most other euro zone states , where no leader wants to explain to taxpayers that the money they lent to athens will never be coming back . 
   `` alas , '' said the mouse , `` the whole world is growing smaller every day . 
  at the beginning it was so big that i was afraid , i kept running and running , and i was glad when i saw walls far away to the right and left , but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that i am in the last chamber already , and there in the corner stands the trap that i must run into . '', 
   `` you only need to change your direction , '' said the cat , and ate it up .

  final help for greece : eu ties up new bailout package http://www.titanic-magazin.de/postkarten/karte/finales-zugestaendnis-24016/, 
  i found this one :  as the standoff nears the deadline which could push greece into default , speculation that the lenders are interested in more than just a bailout agreement has spread . 
   `` i see a punitive stance from the part of the lenders towards greece 's government because of the months of delay in closing the bailout 's fifth review , a vengeful stance , '' said vassilis korkidis , head of the national confederation of hellenic commerce ( esee ) , a business lobby group . 
   `` there may also be a strategy that aims for the government 's fall -- the so-called ` brief life of the left ' solution , '' he said , referring to a popular theory which holds that the syriza government is being tolerated only as a short interim between more mainstream governments . 
   `` but this is a dangerous game . 
  will we have to go bankrupt first to have a different government ? '' he said . 
   the speculation has been fed this week by the presence in brussels of three leading opposition politicians , former centre-right prime minister antonis samaras , fofi gennimata , the leader of his former coalition partner pasok , and stavros theodorakis , leader of the pro-european to potami party . 
   the centre-left efimerida ton syntakton daily suggested that samaras and theodorakis , who have both said they would be ready to serve in a unity government if tsipras fell , would be more welcome to european leaders . 
   `` the conclusion is obvious : domestic and foreign supporters of the bailouts wish to see a scenario that has a brief life for the left , disregarding the will of the people , '' the newspaper said in an editorial . 
   the troika clearly did a reverse corleone -- they made tsipras an offer he ca n't accept , and presumably did this knowingly . 
  so the ultimatum was , in effect , a move to replace the greek government . 
  and even if you do n't like syriza , that has to be disturbing for anyone who believes in european ideals . 
  and it would lead to a continuation of the farce we have seen since 2010 : europe pretends to help greece , and the greek government pretends to reform the country .

  trump says : `` we must as a nation be more unpredictable . '', 
  this is the one sentence i believe him - and it makes me shiver . 
   if he gets 65 % of the remaining votes ... 
  he would need such a result in california ( [ polling average clinton 52.5 % ; sanders 38.4 % ] ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/california-democratic/ ) ) und new jersey ( [ polling average clinton 59.0 % ; sanders 32.2 % ] ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-jersey-democratic/ ) ) - so this sounds like `` if pigs could fly '' .
