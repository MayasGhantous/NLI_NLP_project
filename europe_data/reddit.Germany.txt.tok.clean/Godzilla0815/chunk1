of course they are . 
  if there is anything evil happening on this planet you can be sure deutsche bank had its fingers in it, 
  i like how they have a third truck following just in case, 
  i 'm so glad i voted for him, 
  i agree . 
  after the russian its my favorite anthem . 
  today for the first time in my life i watched golf on tv and now i 'm afraid what this will do to me . 
  malta will allways be my favorite island . 
  i had to 2 of my best holidays there . . happy birthday . 
  for example if you are serbian and living in kosovo or you are albanian and living in serbia . 
  looks like a mistranslation from the german wikipedia :  \u201e hier handelte es sich um einen symbolischen akt , der nichts mit besitzverh\u00e4ltnissen zu tun hat . `` the renaming was a symbolic gesture and had nothing to do with ownership rights . 
  oktoberfest in munich . 
  this really has nothing to do with a different opinion . 
  the reason we live in a unified germany is because of the two plus four agreement and that contains that there will never be any claims to the lost territory east of the oder-neisse line . 
  you really have to end your postings with a '' / s '' or nobody will understand your sarcasm . 
  but that only works if you are black and poor, 
  yes i have been to gdanzk for the euro 2012 :d, 
  i 'm a little late but who cares ... 
  i have been around a lot but unfortunatly not enough countries in the east http://i.imgur.com/nzrbtr9.png, 
  awesome european music : poland : [ riverside - the curtain falls ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k1_7qt_pog ) uk : [ porcupine tree - arriving somewhere but not here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3lsquqgtzm ) , [ anathema - untouchable ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfo332y5uia ) sweden : [ pain of salvation - iter impius and martius nauticus ii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piv5w0zdfxs ), 
  good , there are a few things that just have to be forbidden and supporting a terror organization is one of them . 
  he truely was one of the best of all times . 
  sadly my french was never good enough to watch one of his movies in the original . 
  thanks for the kind words, 
  just to rome for a few days , so they dont have to fly over a war zone or something but silly me is still a bit worried . 
  and i have to bring my parents to the airport tomorrow morning ... how fun, 
  he plays a pretty convincing prime minister on 24 , maybe he should try it in real life . 
  if we would limit our sales to nato members and other stable democracies i would have no problem with this but selling our stuff to algeria or saudi arabia is just wrong . 
  with the things the us and the uk do in the name of fighting terrorism i dont think they want to win . 
  i was also trained as infrantry with a rocket-propelled grenade but my main job was gunner and loader in the [ jagdpanzer jaguar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaguar_1 ) . 
  as you can see in the [ picture ] ( http://www.panzer-modell.de/referenz/in_detail/jaguar1/003g.jpg ) it was a relativly flat tank with just a imaging system on the top . 
  if you aimed at a target a robot arm with the rocket came out of the roof and destroyed any tank in a matter of seconds up to 4km away . 
  i did 10 month in 98 . 
  it was awesome because the cold war was over and 911 hadnt happenend yet so basically it was really peaceful . 
  i was still trained with the cold war in mind as a antitank specialist ( panzerj\u00e4ger ) . 
  and frankfurt too, 
  so basicly they are these guys : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=768h3tz4qik, 
  my most prized possession is the album from the 1990 world cup with allmost all autographs of the german nationalteam on their stickers . 
  they had their training camp before the world cup directly beside my school . 
  yes but not immediately . 
  most military bases were not directly on the inner german border to get some reaction time and be a bit save . 
  basically as soon as russian tanks would have crossed the inner german border us nukes would have destroyed east germany and vice versa . 
  the nukes that would have been used for that are so small that their explosion would only effect a relativly small area like the [ pershing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mgm-31_pershing ) or the [ ss-12 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ss-12_scaleboard ) . 
  ultimately this stalemate was what preserved the peace . 
  yes and against the other warsaw pact armies . 
  unfortunatly they would have been all useless because the first stage of ww3 would have been to to turn germany in a nuclear hell hole to stop the other army to travel through it . 
  poland has a beautiful beach at the baltic sea . 
  scary that the fp\u00d6 got so many votes, 
  this maybe the wrong thread for this question , but could somebody explain to me why some countries vote on a workday ? 
  isnt it better if its on a weekend where most people dont work and have actually time to go voting ? 
  those arent even the funny ones ... they have dozens that are much better, 
  well , no suprise there ... 
  0 points ... fuck you austria, 
  maybe it has something to do with our song beeing shit ... 
  you had by far the worst song ... 
  fuck this audience, 
  lordi was the best band of all times in the eurovision, 
  there are probably not only gay men but also lesbians voting ... so you never know, 
  ok ... i 'm obviously not drunk enough for this, 
  my penis want me to call for poland, 
  wow , thats crazy, 
  14 cent is too expensive for me ... you guys have to decide, 
  yeah the polish tits are back, 
  ralf siegel on the piano ... now i 've seen everything, 
  whats up with her ear ? 
  this finish song sounds familiar, 
  she really could have worn something that showed her breasts better, 
  wtf france ? 
  lol, 
  ok i think this will be a strong contender ... for the last place, 
  that looks like it could be my favorite, 
  now i 'm confused , are we using this thread or the one from 8 hours ago ? 
  ... who cares prost or sk\u00f8l, 
  ok . . time for beer, 
  i decided to watch this against my better judgement ... is there going to be a live thread ? 
  ok you convinced me , after all i am a subscriber of / r/carcrash, 
  so half of the british parties want to leave the eu ? 
  sadly i only know a few words from the secret language http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manisch only spoken in my hometown . 
  however i try to speak our local hessian dialect but because everything hessian you hear in the media is frankfurter hessian the other hessian dialects are slowly dying . 
  democracy comes back after this break, 
  wow ... that was beautiful, 
  there is no alcohol ban here but because all stores are closed today you can only buy alcohol in gas stations and for the most part they are ridiculous expensive . 
  in german its called klammer\u00e4ffchen which means a small spider monkey http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spider_monkey, 
  we should start by freezing all bank accounts owned by russians in the west . 
  if the oligarchs cant get to their billions i have a feeling an accident will happen to putin soon enough . 
  the sad thing is that even if russia conquers the whole of ukraine the west cant do shit about it . 
  the worst putin has to fear is a strong worded letter . 
  the judges are probably fdp voters :d, 
  the eu could freeze or seize all money the members of the ukrainan government or their families have in bank accounts in the eu . 
  well if there would be a legal way to watch the movies and series i am interested in at the time i want to watch it and in english , i would gladly pay for it . 
  for example i just saw that i could watch the 2nd series of house of cards on germany sky anytime today if i would pay 10 $ more per month to sky for the movie package . 
  but thats only one and for everything else i have to wait up to a year until the blu ray is released here so i could watch things in english . 
  there is a dutroux joke in here somewhere, 
  [ f\u00e4\u00e4gmeel - rure roiwe robb maschin ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcdcxjde6ze ), 
  maybe serbia in 2020, 
  first of all before i take this serious can somebody explain the source ? 
  who is this guy and is this a just a webshow or from a tv station ? 
  by far the best german band is rpwl : hole in the sky : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yylzvtgshoe unchain the earth : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byfbncc8rdi, 
  well i agree that if you want the moral high ground you have to say no to all weapons exports . 
  but i personally have no problems with it if we sell our stuff to nato countries or allies we really dont have to fear in the forseeable future , countries that wont sell the weopons to paramilitary units or terrorists and are stable enough in their democracy that they wont use these weapons against their own people .
