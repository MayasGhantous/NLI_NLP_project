  if you want to go now : visit some of the wine regions ( champagne , palatinate ) as they have a lot of festivities atm and lay in between paris and frankfurt . 
  in winter : visit either the scandinavia / alps for a snowy endeavor . 
  or some island in the mediterranian sea ( even better canary islands ) for vacation or even morocco ( not europe but very close ), 
  definetly raising your arm for the hitler salute . 
  also do n't make funny pics at holocaust memorials . 
  other than that : do n't try to drive 220 km/h in your car which never experienced such a velocity . 
  the tires might not be alright or some other part starts to move when it should n't . 
  berlin specific : the trees are no public toilets and please do n't impregnate your one night stand at some inner city corner . 
  we are tolerant , but there has to be a red line . 
  i 'd buy one of these, 
  i found the `` law '' https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rohs-richtlinien but couldnt find any search engine to look up the stuff individually . 
  there is something similar for trademarks , so maybe search there for the manufakturer http://m.epo.org/app/index.html#/search?apptype=patent&amp;language=de, 
  typically the ce and gs certificates provide the prove for relative safety . 
  but you never know , asbestos was n't illegal and in heavy use till the 80ies , when they first discovered that asbestos is highly likely to trigger cancer . 
  while it is better to have such a certificate , it will never guarantee you absolute safety, 
  the alternative ( de ohne regeln ) is too far right , so i 'd rather accept the folks of r/de with their left views , than the nut jobs of r/de _ ore, 
  none internet specific ; except for maimai which means meme . 
  other , there are shortenings of sentences like : hdl = hab dich lieb / i like you lg = liebe gr\u00fcj3e / greetings but these were more common with sms . 
  most germans just use the english ones as everybody understands them here edit : forgot to add ; there is a trend to shorten the word ein / one to the numeral letter 1 , resulting in funny sentences like : `` albert 1st1 s1 hund war kl1 '' . 
  `` albert einsteins dog was small '', 
  r/worldnews / s, 
  americans are very self centered , e.g. 
  when talking about st. petersburg , the whole world knows you mean russian st.petersburg , while many americans would think of `` their '' st.petersburg . 
  even if you tell them that there is a 1:10 disparity concerning the number of inhabitants . 
  they still refuse to rank the russian city `` higher '' than the american st. petersburg, 
  lets call it moncrazy, 
  refugees overthrowing our lifestyle a girl in a dirndl will greet you in every city . 
  probably that we have the best autobahn economic stability and prosperity for all, 
  the swiss alps , it 's nature is really artisan, 
  yes , this was it . 
  back then i paid ~ 200 $ for a pass within western europe but not uk * afaik * edit : omfg what 's wrong with those prices ? 
  lol omg . 
  so then i 'd advice you to take the bus ... * omgwhathavetheydone *, 
  as far as i remember , the eurorail tickets are everything you need , as they are a `` flatrate '' for trains . 
  so pay once , drive everywhere . 
  but my information might be a bit outdated ( 2009 ), 
  you could book the flights early , if you know your date 6 months prior . 
  this gives you the opportunity to `` negotiate '' with some major airlines . 
  do n't rent a car !, 
  buy one . 
  a transporter like a mercedes vito / sprinter or a vw t4 starts at 3000 $ . 
  you could throw a bed in the back and travel all the way like in a caravan . 
  but let me tell you , it wo n't be easy or relaxing and still is very dangerous . 
  my ultimate advise would be to get 2 flats , one in lisbon one in brno and buy cheap stuff for each . 
  the one in lisboa could potentially be rented out on airbnb . 
  this way you reduce the stuff you are traveling with and therefore also then costs . 
  retire _ goodbye _, 
   5 hours that 's quick compared to your eastern border, 
  german french border was secured by border forces who checked the papers of your car , the drivers license and the passports of everyone inside . 
  in a train , you had to get off at wissembourg and there were guards checking your passports , and sometimes also your baggage . 
  i 'd like to say that you can still get a decent check for yourselfe at the swiss border , but it is n't that militaristic anymore there . 
  schengen completely changed how we interact with each other , our food and even to some extend our lifestyle . 
  ( living close to german french border at the rhine ), 
  at the `` wurstmarkt '' ( like oktoberfest but for wine ) , there always is a ton of mp 's protecting their soldiers , but more important : protecting locals from their soldiers . 
  i remember sorties from the 90s where russians and turks living in germany would join their forces together to fight agains the u.s. 
  boys . 
  but : it has changed , as the `` rough boys '' are n't here anymore . 
  intelligence forces and special forces took their positions here . 
  and they behave far more considerate and it 's always fun to party with them, 
  quick !, 
  post now before danes see this thread for germany : `` m '' `` life of others '' '' ... ? '', 
  edit : for other very fine suggestions see below, 
  i raise you [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantic_slave_trade ), 
  gyms are very popular in germany too . 
  but we do n't want to be mr/mrs universe . 
  it 's more like a short workout and then up to the spa, 
  cheapest and somehow good quality would be the $ 50 jeans from h & amp ; m , but you can also get some cheap jeans for $ 10 . 
  but nothing compares to a levi 's . 
  at least in my opinion , as i had n't had the opportunity of draping myself with other , maybe better , jeans, 
  fun fact : the current flag is the upside down version of the original flag, 
  $ 120 in germany ... 
  the aqueduct is really impressing , nice engineering and planing, 
  first minute : _ hey , i do understand that _ second min : _ what the . . ? _, 
  educational and job related : germany fun in the spring of your life : definitely not germany, 
  asked my aunt who lives there : \\ # 1 ) for the simple people it 's bad , not as bad as in '96 but compared to 2013 there was a decline . 
  a lot of young folks had been enlisted , leading to a strong focus on military ( even their olympic outfit is a sort of camouflage ) . 
  what i often overheard is a certain form of heroization . 
  so the focus can be dragged from solving interior problems to praising another hero . 
  but , if you have money , you do n't have to worry much . 
  so all in all the same shit as ever plus the war . 
  \\ # 2 ) nothing anymore . 
  ukrainians do n't trust anyone anymore , cause barely everyone just lies . 
  addendum : usa is the shit over there , as they supported ukraine quite frankly and overwhelmingly . 
  for germany , i would definitely say it 's because of all the people from eastern europe cleaning our streets to earn money . 
  i own a medium sized company that does this , and most of my employees are from eastern europe . 
  __ and to add __ germans are __ not __ that `` clean '' . 
  many people throwaway their cigarettes on the ground or into the flowers or litter their paper bags from the bakery . 
  cool thing . 
  i know it 's like this in barely every european country . 
  but here , they are gon na bill you for that tap water too :(, 
  you 'll have a hard time searching for a restaurant with obligatory water-bottle on table in germany . 
  if you go for a 50 $ dinner , they sure will give you free water . 
  but this is rather an exception edit : was drinking coffee once and we ordered a bottle for three . 
  the two coffees for each costed around 15 $ . 
  the bottle of water did cost 8 $, 
  kazakhstan and the neighboring countries have their own culture and lifestyle . 
  they try to conserve their values and take one step at a time towards the modern world . 
  whether it 's east or west of it, 
  if trump wants to impress us europeans , he just would have to wear a donald duck costume all the time he visits . 
  this would improve his ratings over here .
