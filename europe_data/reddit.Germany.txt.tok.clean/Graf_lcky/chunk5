  so it 's pretty simple as the sun is a sphere which has 360 segments and 1/12 is 36 . 
  so you have to ride the camel for 360 steps , until you exactly meet the old beduin who then can lead you up the hill . 
  but there one has to be careful , because the hill is measured in eyeball length . 
  so it 's pretty difficult to know how long one must go up to reach the top when measuring in imperial , cause you literally have to measure in eyeballs . 
  knee down and press the eye on the ground . 
  but in metric , we know that eyeballs are spheres too . 
  so we can easily let the camel press its eyeball on the ground , until we reach the top . 
  no offense , but everywhere i look there are job offers for everyone , ranging from a waitress to care personal and up to engineers . 
  the downside might be to live in a rural 50k inhabitants german town , and the cultural activities might be limited to an annual city festival . 
  but other than that , and maybe the tristesse of the muddy winter combined with brutalist concrete buildings , other than that , it is ok to live here . 
  as a german , 2006 has been an awesome year , thanks to all the friends from europe and around the world , visiting this land in the summer . 
  and i got ta admit , zizous header has been the cherry on top of it . 
  okay , what the heck did you lead to the thought that there would be more people in favor for brexit in a pro european sub ? 
  there are some gems in public tv , like `` die anstalt '' , `` heute-show '' , `` nmr '' or even `` frontal21 '' and `` monitor '' . 
  also there is arte.tv which levitates above everything else . 
  cause fh plebs knock on their head if they have to knock on wood / jk, 
  i would say the 2013 fdp debacle is comparable . 
  the fdp ( liberals ) gained 15 % in the election of 2009 . 
  never in their history did they win so many seats . 
  they entered a coalition with merkels cdu and had 1/3 of the government seats for them . 
  in 2013 thou , they lost everything and did n't even qualify for parliament . 
  many of the old folks there resigned . 
  the new ones will try to get back into parliament this autumn . 
  if they fail , the whole ( federal ) liberal party will collapse . 
  how do the maggots taste ? 
  is . . is this a frikandel filled with cream ? 
  well the first few comments were n't negative . 
  the dane who said that this person should not have answered the question , is absolutely right with it . 
  personal opinion : there are and even have been morons around us . 
  with the internet how ever , they are more visible . 
  do n't be bothered by them . 
  if their product is good , they sure will help you , no matter where you are from . 
  if they do n't , just let them be morons for themselves . 
  thats right , it is a little play on words , as `` chlopzi '' is a synonym for `` guys '' or `` lads '' in russian , 
   loop back to a city closer by plane planes are cheaper and faster than trains . 
  so your last leg would be ( as i imagine ) awful . 
  especially when the train is delayed and you got to catch the flight . 
  as a suggestion , why not travel from point a to point b and then fly back to a ? 
  but to help you , what do you want to endeavor ? 
  party ? 
  art ? 
  culture ? 
  music ? 
  without this information , it is impossible to suggest places you 'd like , 
  well the crisis began in 2012 for italy and greece . 
  we just did n't bother to deal with it , cause it did n't really affect us until recently, 
  [ waldheimer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurt_waldheim ) ? 
  south west / mannheim area very welcomed . 
  just a few people complained , and even then not about the immigrants but about the chaotic handling of the situation . 
  the area itself has been a magnet for migrants ever since . 
  many italians , turks and russians , so it was n't too difficult to integrate the new ones . 
  to answer the second first ; the raf formed as a protest against the `` still fascistic german state '' ( ss guys now in suites ) and carried out most attacks in the beginning agains economic leaders or us military personnel . 
  the mood at the time was , let say divided . 
  there were the revolutionary generation '68 and the opposite , conservative parents of them who voted for hitler 30 years earlier . 
  it is impossible to boil it all down in a short reddit post . 
  there is a good book by `` stefan aust '' called `` bader-meinhof-komplex '' with about 600 pages . 
  so it 's really complicated . 
  why the wehrsportgruppe has no english wiki page is beyond my knowledge . 
  maybe someone does n't want others to know about it . 
  i will translate one when i have time . 
  the wehrsportgruppe hoffmann , on the other hand , was a terroristic group similar to the oas in france ( please correct me if wrong ) . 
  but the wsgh consisted of former nazi officials who met regularly for training and to forge plans of attacks . 
  there are claims that they even were state sponsored and later had the possibility to join the federal intelligence agencies of germany ( bnd and verfassungsschutz ) . 
  the attack on the oktoberfest has been linked to one guy who was n't mentally capable of planing and building the bomb etc. 
  some journalists uncovered that he had contact with some sort of semi state agency , likely some kind of wsgh . 
  the recent nsu terror series should be regarded in the same light , semi state sponsored attacks . 
  the fact that 4 key witnesses already died before try could be heard at court , is somehow unsettling in the nsu case . 
  : it has been a bit difficult to gather most informations , since the last time i researched ( 2012 for uni ) someone split the incidents up , and some information went `` lost '' somehow . 
  so the numbers might be a bit off , but not too much . 
  the one with the highest death toll would be an attack carried out by a far-right group on the oktoberfest in 1980 , with 13 immediately death and over 200 critical injured . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/oktoberfest_terror_attack ) following would be the one from last december at the berlin christmas market where 12 people lost their life . 
  other attacks would be an attack in istanbul , killing 12 german tourists . 
  and an attack in 2004 in tunisia , killing 12 people . 
  terrorist is n't new to germany . 
  there have been terroristic groups like the radikal left raf ( rote armee fraktion / baader-meinhof-group ) or the radical right `` wehrsportgruppe hoffmann '' ( might be linked to the oktoberfest bombing ) what 's new , is that while for example the raf mostly aimed at elites , important persons or military targets . 
  the new , islamic terror aims at the ordinary people . 
  these fuckers edit : forgot , but should n't be forgotten . 
  in 1972 , during the olympics in munich , palestinian aligned terrorists stormed the houses of israeli athletes and took 11 hostages . 
  ~ ~ two ~ ~ eleven were killed . 
  this group is also aligned with the raf . 
  also there were some attacks carried out by foreign intelligence agencies , like the attack on the discotheque `` la belle '' in , which is believed has been ordered by gaddafi,

  i just googled it because i thought i miss a reference here . 
  and it hit me hard that the first __ 5 __ ( ! ), 
  results for madagascar were for the movies , interrupted at the sixth position with the actual country , only to be followed by further movie sites . 
  this is kinda sad . . 
  madagascar , if i 'm welcome there, 
  ahaha , did n't knew romania did it first :p, 
  [ this classic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdqxvhspu5c ) is timeless,

  because we all pay for their shenanigans . 
  their `` new '' airport is already 5 years too late and costs 10 billion instead of the promised 1.4 billion . 
  and many things more , but the airport is the main reason atm, 
  ya because no one would accept you as a tenant ever again . 
  i liked how some at td asked normal questions about the election system , these questions where then answered in a normals way like `` the one gets this the other has to do that '' . 
  so no political alignment of the users were visible . 
  the answer even got +25 after 20 minutes . 
  half an hour later , the question still is there , the answer with +25 is deleted , and instead the top answer with +40 was `` because they are cucks '' it was just a prove more that td admins do n't want their base to be educated . 
  they need 'em dumb, 
  hungary is a very nice country .
