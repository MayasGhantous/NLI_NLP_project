  for example dividing rome between the republican and the imperial period is indeed totally unwarranted . 
  the change in government type did n't destroy the state and did n't stop it from further expanding . 
  the cutoff date of a.d. 180 also seems to be very arbitrary . 
  the empire pretty much stopped expanding afterward but it survived for roughly three hundred years in its enlarged form and for another thousand until it finally fell . 
  the end date for the ottoman empire is equally puzzling as it was a major european power at least until the 18th century and did n't fall until the 20th . 
  on the other hand alexander 's empire fractured pretty much immediately after his death into several independent states , which makes continuing it until 100 b.c. 
  more than a bit strange . 
  [ the bamf seems to be not so sure about tunisia either . 
  ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/2016-10/maghreb-staaten-bamf-sichere-herkunftsstaaten-gesetz-thomas-de-maiziere ) and even if we would declare the maghreb states to be `` safe countries '' , would that solve our problem ? 
  i thought we could n't deport many people back to north africa simply because their home countries do n't take them back . 
  well but you should n't declare countries to be safe because you have people from there that you want to be rid of . 
  the question is does tunisia actually meet the criteria to be declared a `` safe country '' . 
  i do n't know if the aula palatina really counts . 
  it was used as a church only from the 19th century . 
  and while trier cathedral was heavily modified it does still preserve parts of the fourth century church building . 
   look at austria , they do n't have to say they 're sorry about the war every day , even three generations later . 
  is that why they almost voted for a member of the successor party to the nsdap to be their head of state ? 
  look , i do n't know anybody here in germany who has to say he 's sorry for ww2 every day . 
  i just somehow do n't think it is a good idea to forget about the nazis and their crimes at the same time when nationalism and far right movements are again at the rise all over europe . 
   you should probably study the issue a little bit more . 
  you missed my vmro-dpmne part of the original comment yeah , but greece has been denying macedonia 's claim to the name long before vmro-dpmne came into power and made those exagerated claims on the ancient macedonian kingdom . 
  sure , but the word `` swiss '' can refer to both so `` swiss with ghanaian roots '' was n't a euphemism . 
  there is n't really a reason to get riled up by reading it except if you are offended by the very concept of someone from ghana becoming a swiss citizen . 
  the paris attackers were hiding in a community in which they had grown up in . 
  this guy is from tunisia and most likely not very well connected in berlin . 
  so totally different cases . 
  lol . 
  and which voices would that be ? 
  or like an important pre-socratic [ philosopher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heraclitus ) ... 
  um , maybe because istanbul is one of europe 's largest cities ? 
  pfff , yeah , let 's hope my descendants are n't compelled to inflict ethnic cleansing just because there are brown people living in their home country . 
  and that garbled mess is probably supposed to be a link but unfortunately i ca n't see how it proves that your equation of `` more people = less jobs '' is anything but bogus . 
  so there is n't actually any replacement happening and your fear is just that `` they 're taking our jobs !!!! '' ? 
  well , fear no more because your assertion that there 's a finite number of goods , jobs and services that a country can provide to its citizens frankly does n't make a whole lot of sense . 
  if it would be true we would run into the danger of running out of jobs no matter by which means the population increases , by immigration or by growth of the native population . 
  and yet although the german population is many millions larger today than it was a few decades ago we did n't actually run out of jobs . 
  that 's not all that surprising when you consider that population growth can also create entirely new job opportunities . 
  all those new people need to buy food , clothing , furniture , cell phones , cars and a myriad of other things . 
  they go to the hairdresser , the gym , the doctor etc. 
  they need to call a plumber or a technician . 
  they may even start their own business . 
  and that 's true even if those new people are [ filthy foreigners ] ( https://www.thelocal.de/20160811/immigrants-create-13-million-jobs-in-germany-report ) !, 
  so you do n't need to worry about us . 
  it 's not a zero-sum game . 
  so i assume this means you 're not going to tell me who exactly is replaced here . 
  the number of muslims going up simply means that there are more people coming in . 
  for a replacement to happen someone else would have to leave . 
  who is pushed out here ? 
  where is this happening ? 
  are there any white people expelled from their homeland in europe right now ? 
  i 'm sorry but by that little slip of the tongue , by calling tourism a `` temporary population replacement '' u/falloutfan2 inadvertently put a spotlight on how hollow and nonsensical that whole replacement rhetoric actually is . 
  no one is replaced . 
  it 's just a malicious attempt to redefine words . 
  it 's using the term `` replacement '' instead of `` immigration '' as if the two were synonymous . 
  but they are obviously not the same thing . 
  wait , you 're even calling tourism `` temporary population replacement '' ? 
  i 'm curious , who exactly do you think is replaced here ? 
  and how ? 
  i can live with that . 
  he was n't that bad of a writer . 
  bookmark it if you like but do n't be surprised that people wo n't take you seriously when you bring it up . 
  being fined with 500 $ is n't exactly on par with china 's human rights violations . 
   first thing that ** pooped ** in my mind was something a lot worse i can see that . 
  just rolls off the tongue . 
  really inspiring how apparently not knowing anything about bulgarian or macedonian history and culture did n't stop you from still commenting on the topic !, 
  those yawn inducing jokes sure come naturally to you , do n't they ? 
  or you know , you could just read the article :  the vast majority of the immigrant population , though , had links to other european countries . 
  and what exactly does this have to do with the napoleonic wars ? 
  probably to explain why they speak to him in german . 
  is there a reason you guys so often turn out to be [ anti-semites ] ( http://i.imgur.com/splntgu.jpg ) or [ defenders of fascism ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gk3w67l.jpg ) ? 
  [ well ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lala_mustafa_pasha_mosque ), 
  the [ blue mosque ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ftlbdt5.jpg ) has some clear influences from hagia sophia but it 's far from a copy . 
  however the hagia sophia , the most famous church turned mosque and out of all byzantine churches the most influential on ottoman architecture , was n't actually designed to be decorated with much pictorial decoration at all . 
  its extant mosaics from justinian 's time are all [ an-iconic ] ( https://larrymuffinathome.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_3089.jpg ) . 
  obviously there are plenty of churches from the 6th century that do feature depictions of humans but it was n't as much the norm as it became after iconclasm . 
  hagia sophia 's mosaics showing christ , mary , angels , saints and emperors were all added in later centuries and they do n't necessarily fit the architecture all that well . 
  you can see it for example with the depiction of the virgin in the apse . 
  that [ mosaic ] ( http://haemus.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/the-apse-mosaic-in-the-hagia-sophia.jpg ) is huge but its almost drowned by the [ monumentality of the architecture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bizip2b.jpg ) . 
  there just is n't enough space in the semidome of the apse to hold a picture that does n't look a little awkward . 
  so in a way the later ottoman decoration is closer to the original design of hagia sophia than the medieval one . 
  that 's not supposed to denigrate those mosaics . 
  they 're amazing . 
  but you can tell that the building was n't erected with them in mind . 
  nice !, 
  some other examples for ottoman baroque would be the [ laleli ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g7ljxrc.jpg ) [ camii ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ruqpwje.jpg ) , also in istanbul , or the [ yal\u0131 camii ] ( http://i.imgur.com/029c3ed.jpg ) in izmir . 
  it has also a fairly unique [ semicircular forecourt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/stg29ab.jpg ) . 
  so why do you even bring up the question how much of turkey lies on the european continent if it 's suddenly not important to you anyway ? 
  and why are you acting as if `` eurasian '' and `` european '' are mutually exclusive categories ? 
  eurasia is the combination of europe and asia . 
  literally every country in europe is eurasian . 
  and finally , what 's a `` culturally european country '' ? 
  what is it that makes the culture of bulgaria , albania or bosnia more similar to norway or ireland than to turkey ? 
  you wrote that only few maps showed parts of turkey in europe and i doubted that , apparently for good reason . 
  and i 'm not sure if `` tiny '' adequately describes a region that houses more than 1/8 of turkey 's population . 
  most of them show thrace as part of europe . 
  and why would n't they ? 
  it 's separated from anatolia by sea while on the other hand there is no geographical separation from the european mainland whatsoever . 
  gateways usually open in two directions . 
  few maps ? 
  what strange maps were you looking at that were n't showing istanbul and the rest of thrace as part of europe ?
