  cool , good to know . 
  but that arguably would make turkey the home of the levantine minority . 
  and it certainly does n't answer the question why a christian from tur abdin who might never have entered iraq or have any ancestors from that country should be considered iraqi . 
  oh , i certainly did n't want to accuse you of being a genocide denier . 
  and sure , assyrians probably did n't have a huge impact on the cultural makeup of the entirety of anatolia . 
  after all they were n't a very numerous people even before the genocide . 
  but they certainly were important in the most eastern parts of anatolia . 
  regions like the tur abdin or the hakkari mountains have been peopled by aramaic speaking christians for centuries or even millenia . 
  claiming that they are n't the homeland of those people and that assyrians somehow are as alien to them as italians would bee simply has no basis . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  why would the homeland of a people like the assyrians be defined by modern borders that came into being only relatively recently ? 
  claiming that all assyrians are iraqi is n't nitpicking , it 's just strange and even flat out wrong for those that have been living in regions that today belong to turkey or iran for generations . 
  you do know that all those things you describe also happened in the 20th century ? 
  and you still think that german reunification - that , to be clear , has n't caused anything remotely similar - is worse ? 
  if you want some up to date works on the western roman empire and its end i 'd recommend [ * peter heather , the fall of the roman empire * ] ( http://www.hsozkult.de/publicationreview/id/rezbuecher-9852 ) and [ * guy halsall , barbarian migration and the roman west , 376-568 * ] ( http://www.sehepunkte.de/2009/02/14063.html ) . 
  both have very different ideas about why exactly the empire fell . 
  heather stresses external factors , especially the impact of the hunic invasion , while halsall focuses more on internal developements and sees the barbaric migrations as a result of the imperial collapse and not as its cause . 
  as the question about the fall of the roman empire is a hughely complicated matter it probably is n't bad to look at two very different approaches to the subject . 
  as you have an austrian flair i 'll add [ * henning b\u00f6rm , westrom . 
  also very much up to date , readable and a much faster read than the other two . 
  i 'd say just like in rome the city lost its population because of the gradual loss of imperial territory that sustained it . 
  you can clearly see that 1453 is not the point where the decline starts or intensifies but where it reaches its lowest point . 
  when constantinople again became the capital of a large empire with the resources and political will to sustain it its population grew again substantially . 
  actually he should know what it means as there is the exact same expression in german . 
  someone you can trust completely is someone * mit dem man pferde stehlen kann * . 
  sorry that you had to learn it this way . 
   the idea of a mono-cultural and mono-ethinc europe when was this ever the case ? 
  you could try * barbara jelavich - charles jelavich , the establishment of the balkan national states 1804-1920 * for the emergence of nation states in the balkans . 
  * paul m. cobb , the race for paradise . 
  an islamic history of the crusades * is a nice up to date look on the crusades focusing on the muslim experience . 
  so you think greeks should only care about greek lives ? 
  the millions of other deaths in ww2 are somehow irrelevant to them ? 
  this is extremely hyperbolic . 
  after all we 're talking about the same europe where two world wars started and the greatest genocide in human history happened . 
  sure , the ottoman conquest was destructive - which conquest ever is n't ? 
  and sure , living under ottoman rule was n't a picknick for most balkan christians . 
  but it was n't anything like we are witnessing under isis these days . 
  otherwise the balkans certainly would n't be majority orthodox today . 
  greece and other balkan nations even have several [ splendid ] ( http://camperistas.com/it/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/meteora_106.jpg ) [ christian ] ( http://diakonima.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/moni-koutloumousiou-02.jpg ) [ churches ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2607/3986024019_835fdac456_b.jpg ) that were build in ottoman times . 
  and how long do jews have to live in europe until you would consider them europeans ? 
   well , the greeks were christians only those that did n't convert to islam which certainly happened . 
  so it 's not that there ca n't be any genetic relations between the populations of modern greece and turkey , even if they may exist mainly because of greeks that turned muslim and by that eventually turkish . 
  you 're suddenly taking this awfully seriously for someone who was just joking around . 
  well :  true but they crossed the rhein and turned their backs on germania !, 
  the franks did n't turn their backs on germania and certainly did n't do so by simply crossing the rhine . 
  especially when the attack on the alemanni happened large parts of them still settled inside what was called germania back then and what would today be part of germany . 
  i guess it 's news to someone with a `` kingdom of w\u00fcrtemberg '' flair but the days of napoleon are long gone and not everything left of the rhine is france . 
  thanks !, 
  although , he only talks about intermarriage between muslims and christians not turks and greeks and even states that the former was possible if it was a muslim man marrying a christian woman . 
  also , do you have anything more recent than 1916 ? 
  this does n't exactly seem to be cutting edge scholarship . 
  for example i 'm pretty sure his claim that the * millet * system was put in place already by mehmed ii has been disproven long ago . 
   it says it in the first sentence right there but i was fully aware of this before even seeing this , surprised you did n't know . 
  of course back then part of the middle east was the byzantine empire . 
  you 're confusing the institution of the church with a church as a building . 
  the wikipedia article you linked to is describing the former but not the later . 
  the near eastern origin of the church as an institition does n't tell you anything about where the different architectural styles for churches originated because the first ones were only build centuries after the times of the apostels . 
  the greek orthodox church uses several different types of church buildings but the most common one might be the [ cross-in-square type church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-in-square ) of which the ones in the picture seem to be examples . 
  it came into being in the middle ages inside the byzantine empire , probably at constantinople , as the endproduct of a long history of experimentation with domed architecture . 
  a direct connection to persian or islamic architecture is unlikely . 
  also , the simple fact that a building contains a dome is only a very broad similarity . 
  varying domed buildings can still look very different from each other and do not need to be related in any way . 
  look at [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/pantheon-panini.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0d5xgbj.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/10321499/q%3d80_m%3d1500/b1e91d978b39643f2b3ab5b9bf7fed0a ) . 
  do you mind providing a source for that ? 
  interesting . 
  what else does your crytal ball tell about the future ? 
  open it directly next to this one and put up a sign `` dutch/germans welcome ! '', 
  germany is n't supposed to `` pay '' anyone . 
  the agreement was that we and every other nato-member should raise the amount of money spent on our own military to 2 % of our national gdp til 2024 . 
  by the way , spain is n't spending the agreed upon 2 % on its military either . 
  i guess trump should abandon you also . 
  i still fail to see what 's so distasteful to you or how your analogy is supposed to work . 
  kleist ** he ** nes ' home , athens , is n't part of the usa while rome is clearly inside the eu . 
  his/her second post in that chain is very important in this regard :  ha ha . 
  we all know that the stupidity of our nation is at fault here . 
   nevertheless i would never miss an opportunity to underline that blank check period ( 2002-2013 ) when erdogan did as he pleased , without the slightest critism , and on the contrary , with praise from the eu or more generally from the global media . 
  this is not to attempt to shift to blame on them , but to underline how they suddenly changed their stance as soon as erdogan stopped being a puppet to them , whereas his policy to the secular people of turkey was no different than what he does today . 
  and the global media has more impact in internal politics of turkey than what people would think , their attitude matter . 
  in our newspaper you even have some sections on `` what they wrote on turkey in the world '' kind of stuff . 
  the eu was very supportive of erdo\u011fan in his early years in power , no doubt about it . 
  this was also clearly to his benefit . 
  but it does n't mean that a western conspiracy brought him into power in the first place . 
  but that would be kleisthenes . 
  and it does n't make the comparison any less weird . 
  but this is n't evidence at all . 
  it shows that the us may have been involved in a coup in the past . 
  but them being responsible for some or even plenty of shady activities does n't mean that they 're to blame for every development that you do n't like . 
  is there any reason for your believe that the us was involved in the rise of akp beyond the fact that you distrust them ? 
  but then it seems that the only reason that you seem to think the us was involved in erdo\u011fan 's rise is a vague ( and not totally unfounded ) distrust in the west . 
  but western governments being involved in some shady things does n't really translate into them being responsible for everything you do n't like . 
  and the changing relationship between them and erdo\u011fan that you describe does n't convincingly implicate them either . 
  as long as the foreign policy of the akp government was aligned with us and european interest they supported erdo\u011fan and only criticized him more and more harshly when he seemingly changed course . 
  how is this suspicious ? 
  this is what you would expect and you do n't need western involvement in akp 's initial success for that to happen . 
  i asked for evidence not conclusive proof . 
  anything that might at least support your claim . 
  a guy on youtube claiming the same things you do does n't really cut it . 
  and you really should read up on what a scientific theory is . 
  the theory of evolution for example is supported by a ton of evidence and not really on the same level as a conspiracy theory on youtube . 
  if this is an attempt at sarcasm it is really hard to decipher .
