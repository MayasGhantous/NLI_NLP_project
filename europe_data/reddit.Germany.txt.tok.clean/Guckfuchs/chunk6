  i simply wanted to know if you have any actual reason to believe that akp was propped up by the us . 
  you know , like the fact that things fall down is a reason to believe gravity is real . 
  is this a joke ? 
  i have a hard time believing that you actually think gravity is n't real . 
   do you know that there is no evidence that gravity , evolution or supermassive black holes are real ? 
  they 're theories . 
  you honestly think that there is no evidence for those things ? 
  if that 's the case maybe you should look up what a scientific theory is . 
  and then read up on any of those topics . 
  and does this mean that you do n't have any evidence for us involvement in the rise of akp ? 
  he does n't really explain it either . 
  like you he just claims akp 's rise was masterminded by the us without any evidence . 
  among other things he later suggests that 9/11 might have been an inside job or that isis was created by the us to get an excuse to claim land in the middle east . 
  do you have anything a bit more credible ? 
  on an unrelated note : does he know that films like tropic thunder or starship troopers are satire ? 
   and there was an effort to construct an independent identity out of thin air . 
  every national identity is socially constructed . 
  it is n't strictly dictated by culture , genetics or language . 
  that an independent austrian identity has only developed as a result of two world wars does n't make it any less real or more artificial than the german one . 
  concepts of national identity also change over time so the fact that austrians were considered and did consider themselves as german does n't say anything about how most contemporary austrians view themselves . 
  denying your own faith in the face of religious persecution can be permitted in islam . 
  not just lying about anything you want to . 
  the article is about representatives of milli g\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f and s\u00fcleymanc\u0131lar criticizing the president of turkey for his political rhetoric . 
  how do you think can this be described as taqiyya ? 
  just a small correction : the byzantines and the normans did n't cooperate in the capture of sicily . 
  the normans had been attacking and conquering byzantine possessions in southern italy for a while and had even launched invasions into the balkans . 
  so the empire had no reason to be happy about the norman conquest of sicily let alone to help them with it . 
   taqiya ( arabic : \u062a\u0642\u06cc\u0629 taqiyyah/taq \u012byah , literally `` prudence , fear , caution '' ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is an islamic term referring to precautionary ** dissimulation or denial of religious belief and practice in the face of persecution ** . 
  how exactly does this fit here ? 
  and you know , if you cite wikipedia it would be nice if you mention it or even link to the [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taqiya ) . 
  i would n't be absolutely sure if the mosaics were produced by artisans from the byzantine empire or by local workshops that were in some way trained by masters from the greek east . 
  unless of course you know any sources that mention the dispatching of byzantine artists to sicily which was a common practice by the empire after all . 
  what you describe is true and i do n't think there 's anything wrong with it . 
  but i would n't describe that as `` german people think they need to make up for what hitler did '' . 
  have you really ? 
  because i ca n't say that i 've been raised that way . 
  all those pictures of the mosaics with greek inscriptions and no mention of the huge byzantine influence in the title ? 
  but if you want to stress the arab element in sicilo-norman art the [ muqarnas ] ( http://www.wondersofsicily.com/images/1000x700-palermo-cappella-palatina-ceiling-20150528-cappellapalatina_0646.jpg ) [ ceiling ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/dd/91/21/dd912183de7360bc4a4b5ada8ddd7bc2.jpg ) of the cappella palatina in palermo would be a great example . 
  does n't beat the shining city on a hill , [ amerika in saxony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amerika,_saxony ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.caitlingreen.org/2017/03/a-very-long-way-from-home.html ) , have a look . 
  because de facto mesopotamia was already pretty much lost when trajan died . 
  after his initial successes rebellions had sprung up everywhere in the newly conquered provinces and the roman army had to withdraw . 
  trajan died on the way back to rome and his successor hadrian would have had to restart the conquest from scratch . 
  this was not a very attractive option considering the wars against the parthians had already been very costly while at the same time a major jewish rebellion was plaguing many of rome 's eastern provinces . 
  conceding to this reality was probably the smartest move . 
  oh , it absolutely has the meaning of `` king '' . 
  nevertheless from the reign of heraclius onwards the primary title used for the byzantine emperor was * basileus * . 
  it 's even mentioned in the article you linked to . 
  for example have a look at this [ depiction of the coronation of emperor constantine vii porphyrogenetos ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f8/a4/a5/f8a4a50f15d80bdf032526b71fb8f3d0.jpg ) . 
  beneath his hand you can read his title of * basileus rhomaion * . 
  or this [ mosaic of emperor constantine ix monomachos from hagia sophia ] ( http://mikestravelguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/zoe-mosaic-jesus-constantine-ix-and-empress-zoe-hagia-sophia-istanbul-turkey-800x600.jpg ) where the inscription above his head calls him * autokrator pistos basileus rhomaion * . 
  it was the most common way to refer to the emperor in the byzantine middle ages . 
  oh sure , there absolutely was something that could be called the eastern roman empire . 
  but the mistake that it somehow was an entirely new and seperate state is far too common . 
  yeah , but basileus was also the word commonly used for the byzantine emperor , so his name is indeed quite similar to his official title . 
  not to discourage anyone from reading norwich 's work but it is more a work of popular history than an academic one . 
  it 's a very readable introduction into byzantine history but probably not entirely up to the standards of r/askhistorians . 
  but to be fair , the time of extreme instabilty in the persian empire after their defeat had already ended just a few years before the first arab attack when yazdegerd iii ascended the throne . 
  he seems to have been a capable ruler . 
  that 's still almost a century . 
  not everyone would call that `` super fast '' . 
  `` working about laws '' is probably as much an understatement about the kanun of s\u00fcleiman as it is about justinian 's codex iuris civilis . 
  but the romans did n't conceive them as two seperate states but as two halves of a single empire , just with two emperors at the top that were responsible for the government of different territories . 
  laws for example were issued in the names of both emperors . 
  yes , but that already shifts the argument away from questioning whether roma and sinti were enslaved at all , which is what / u/junak66 did . 
  to be clear , i do n't want to simplistically explain current problems of and with roma and sinti minorities with events that may lie centuries in the past . 
  but to deny their unique history of persecution would be dishonest . 
  his comment is extremly hyperbolic but let 's not act like roma and sinti were never enslaved in europe . 
  several times they absolutely were . 
   if you have a better source i 'd like to read it . 
  well , i know about this article : * george soulis , the gypsies in the byzantine empire and the balkans in the late middle ages , dumbarton oaks papers 15 , 1961 , 143-165 . 
  * it actually fits quite well with what dr. achim writes on pp . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i 'll check this out . 
  edit : ok , he seems to pretty much confirm what i thought on pp . 
  30-31 :  the fact that the gypsies of romania arrived there from south of the danube is incontestable : there is a whole series of arguments to support this claim . 
  the romanians have always referred to them using a term of greek origin : in the first documentary attestations they are referred to as a\u0163igani , which later became , tigani , the term still in use today .41 similarly , the spoken language of the gypsies in romania preserves a large number of greek and south slavonic words . 
  [ ... ] the gypsies are nomads of indian origin that arrived in the romanian territories via the balkans , after having spent a relatively long period of time in the byzantine empire , where they acquired the name tsigane . 
  hm , the article itself seems to only source this claim with a reference to `` achim , p. 27-28 '' in the footnotes without elaborating what that actually is . 
  may i ask where that last quote comes from ? 
  romani entering romania with the mongols in the 13th century seems a bit strange to me . 
  gypsies or * atzigganoi * living in the balkans are already mentioned in some byzantine sources from the 11th century onwards . 
  it seems far more likely to me that they entered europe through anatolia and not the south russian steppes . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkrs4rl6pw ), 
  probably not that much . 
  not all of us . 
  some of us live on the civilized side of the rhine . 
  in fact there are numerous greek inscriptions to be found in the eastern part of the roman empire . 
  just one random example would be [ the greek translation of the * res gestae divi augusti * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monumentum_ancyranum ) inscribed on the exterior wall of the * augusteum * in ankara , turkey . 
  or probably erdo\u011fan . 
  i read that you think that you did n't change your question . 
  it 's just that i do n't agree with that . 
  again : my original claim was that many greeks worked under the ottomans as vassals , subjects or renegades . 
  you answered like this :  source me 3 cases of that happening if you actually wanted to know specifically about greek soldiers serving with the ottoman army then you did n't word your question poorly . 
  you flat out asked the wrong question . 
  and to be honest , i kind of suspect that you did n't really want to ask about that originally . 
  you 're constantly shifting the goal posts in this debate . 
  with my first example you contrived all kinds of excuses why they did n't count as greeks , like nongreek mothers or birthplaces outside the borders of the modern ( ! ), 
  greek republic . 
  you probably know yourself that the elites of that time constantly intermarried across ethnic or cultural divides and that membership of a certain ethnic group could n't possibly be defined by not yet existing nation states .
