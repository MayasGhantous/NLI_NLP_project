  so when this tactic did n't work you quietly dropped it . 
  when i answered your second ( ! ), 
  question about greek soldiers besides the janissaries you again redefined the specifics of your question after the fact . 
  now anyone converted as a child does n't count anymore . 
  this kind of sophistry is really tiring and annoying and reeks of trolling . 
  so do n't be surprised if i 'm not really inclined anymore to put in the effort and answer your , frankly quite rude , demands for sources . 
  the definition of being a janissary is being part of the janissary corps and not simply being recruited through the devshirme . 
  mesih pasha was trained as a page and not as a janissary . 
  i feel free to send you no sources whatsoever . 
  my original claim was that many greeks worked under the ottomans as vassals , subjects or renegades . 
  you did n't believe me , so i provided you with proof . 
  then you asked for something different , namely instances of greek soldiers fighting for the ottomans . 
  if that subject interests you feel free to do the digging yourself . 
   you mean because you ca n't find such source , since it does n't exist . 
   seems to me that he was captured and was forcefully converted from 10 years old . 
  so what ? 
  you asked for greeks who were n't janissaries and fought for the ottomans . 
  do you want to change your question again ? 
  and do you think manuel ii and johannes vii , rulers over a largely greek speaking population , did n't bring any greek soldiers with them to the siege of philadelphia ? 
  no , cause i 'm too lazy . 
  so i substitute [ mesih pasha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mesih_pasha ) , byzantine prince from the imperial family of palaiologos , convert to islam and grant vizier under bayezid ii . 
  he personally led the ottoman siege of rhodes in 1480 . 
  `` was an ally of osman and his people in war '' seems to be pretty unambiguous to me . 
  and his descendants , the mihalo\u011fullar\u0131 , played a major role in the early ottoman conquests in the balkans . 
  ok , again three greeks who fought with the ottoman army : 1 ) [ k\u00f6se mihal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6se_mihal ) , who `` was an ally of osman and his people in war '' . 
  2 ) [ manuel ii plaiologos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_ii_palaiologos ) , who aided bayezid i with his siege of philadelphia . 
  3 ) [ johannes vii palaiologos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_vii_palaiologos ) , who participated in the same siege alongside his brother manuel . 
  k\u00f6se mihal is called an ethnic greek in the linked article and the two emperors were linguistically and culturally greek like you said . 
  are you satisfied now ? 
  you 're the one who doubted manuel 's greekness because of his bulgarian mother . 
  in your other comment greek language , culture and mostly their ethnicity was enough to claim the byzantines as greek . 
  i do n't think it 's weird to conclude that this is a contradiction . 
  and if you do n't hold any nationalistic thoughts it sure is weird that it seems to be so abhorrent to you that some greeks actually cooperated with the ottomans . 
  why else do you come up with all sorts of contrivances to deny that ? 
  hey , i 'm not responsible for your confusion . 
  i did answer your original question whether you admit it or not . 
  and are n't you the same guy that yesterday stated to me that the byzantines spoke greek , had greek culture and were mostly ethnically greek ? 
  and now one of their emperors is n't good enough for you because of his mother ? 
  you just disingenuously change your position whenever it suits your nationalist agenda . 
  look , i wrote `` and lets not forget that many greeks also ** worked under ** the ottomans as vassals , subjects or renegades '' and when you wanted examples i provided them . 
  but then you suddenly change the question and specifically ask for greek soldiers , which i did n't even talk about before . 
  stuff like this is really tiring . 
  and so is denying anyone with a nongreek mother or who was borne outside of the area of the modern greek republic ( which did n't even exist back then ! ), 
  their greekness . 
  constantine xi had a serb mother and he still gets a statue in the middle of athens and is hailed as a national hero . 
  but if you cooperate with the ottoman army seemingly anything is enough not to be considered greek . 
  what not even manuel ii is good enough for you ? 
  i really have no patience for your kind of sophistry . 
  i mean you did n't even read the articles i linked to . 
  `` k\u00f6se mihal , was the byzantine governor of chirmenkia and was ** ethnically greek ** . '', 
  is literally the first sentence after the introduction . 
  thanks , those are excellent examples !, 
  the ottomans incorporated all kinds of local elites into their new state and their earliest expansion directly lead them into areas mostly settled by greeks . 
  it would be ludicrous to think that not a single greek changed sides in those times . 
  yeah , it 's pretty fascinating . 
  i think i first read about it in noel malcolm 's * kosovo . 
  a short history * . 
  he refers to an article by halil \u0130nalc\u0131k : * timariotes chr\u00e9tien en albanie au xv . 
  i claimed that many greeks worked under the ottomans as vassals , subjects or renegades and every person i linked to did exactly that . 
  none of the converts i mentioned was a product of the devshirme system and there is no reason to believe anyone of them was converted by force . 
  to differentiate between greeks and cypriots before there even were a greek and a cypriot nation state is pretty pointless . 
  and you know perfectly well that many greeks lived in anatolia , or do you count heraklit or thales not as greeks ? 
  k\u00f6se mihal and hadjigeorgakis kornesios were greeks in the eyes of their contemporaries , which is all that counts . 
  most of the christian rulers in the southern balkans were serbs by the time the ottomans invaded so most of the ottoman vassals were also serb . 
  but you conveniently ignored manuel ii who was a ottoman vassal and fought alongside the ottoman army at philadelphia . 
  1 ) [ k\u00f6se mihal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6se_mihal ) , local greek grandee from bithynia , convert to islam and close confidante to osman i. 
  2 ) [ manuel ii palaiologos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_ii_palaiologos ) , byzantine emperor who was forced to become an ottoman vassal and participated in the capture of philadelphia in western anatolia by the ottomans . 
  3 ) [ mesih pasha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mesih_pasha ) , scion of the imperial family of palaiologos , convert to islam and grant vizier under sultan bayezid ii . 
  4 ) [ hadjigeorgakis kornesios ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadjigeorgakis_kornesios ) , greek from paphos who served as dragoman for the ottoman empire in the late 18th century . 
  5 ) all the [ phanariotes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phanariotes ) from istanbul that served the ottoman sultan in various positions like as vassal rulers of moldavia and wallachia . 
  should i go on or did you really believe that no greek ever served under the ottomans ? 
  does n't make it much better . 
  the swearing is n't really necessary , but you 're right . 
  cossacks were n't only allies to / vassals under the russians but also under poland-lithuania and sometimes even the ottomans . 
  and the chmielnicki uprising is definitely part of polish not russian history . 
  i think it 's a bit strange to talk about `` the serbs '' of this time as some kind of uniform entity . 
  plenty of local serb rulers cooperated with the ottomans , normally not really out of their own volition . 
  others fought against them . 
  and lets not forget that many greeks also worked under the ottomans as vassals , subjects or renegades . 
  serbs served in a variety of ways in the armies of mehmed iv . 
  first there are the janissaries which were products of the infamous youth levy . 
  they were taken as children from christian families in the balkans and raised as muslims to , among other tasks , serve as the ottoman 's elite troops . 
  then there are the forces of vassal rulers like marko kraljevi\u0107 or stefan lazarevi\u0107 that were obliged to assist the ottomans in their wars . 
  and last but not least there were the timariotes , local grandees that were granted the revenues of certain areas in return for military service . 
  most of them were muslim but up until the 15th century there also existed christian timariotes . 
  it was only later that only muslims would serve in the ottoman armies . 
  i just think it 's funny that you could simply have admitted `` 283 comments ago '' that your original comment was worded a little poorly but instead chose to keep digging yourself deeper . 
  how is an area supposed to be a strong power ? 
  if you write `` turkey has always been a strong power in the region , if not the world , for millennia . '', 
  that directly implies that there was an entity called `` turkey '' for most of the last two thousand years . 
  that is certainly a controversial claim . 
  you sure like your hyperbole , do n't you ? 
  all non-islamic academics ? 
  turkey will never recover ? 
  and what were merkel or obama supposed to do ? 
  violently overthrow erdogan ? 
  not sure what got you so riled up . 
  all i 'm saying is that your definition of `` turkey '' seems to be pretty unusual . 
  you 'd really call the roman/byzantine empire turkey ? 
   millennia is n't several thousand years , its any multiple of thousands .
