  i think you misunderstood . 
  the map 's legend says : `` europe and the byzantine empire about 1000 '' as if the byzantine empire was n't part of europe . 
  i would disagree with that but it reminded of people on this sub getting angry whenever turkey is called european . 
  not sure what argument you want to refute . 
  or possibly russians . 
  both seem to have difficulties with being counted as part of europe . 
   anyway , what purposes it has ? 
  to show how the size of the jewish population in european countries changed since 1933 ? 
   europe and the byzantine empire about 1000 seems the byzantine empire was the turkey of the middle ages . 
  well yeah , but the map also shows armenia in deep red . 
  so i 'm not really sure what 's meant here by `` orthodox '' . 
  i 'm not sure what the ecumenical patriarchate 's official stance on them is . 
  but how is that even relevant ? 
  they split apart after all . 
  there is more than one patriarch for both of those seats . 
  the melkite ones are still connected to constantinople , the miaphysite ones are not . 
  yes , although there are also separate miaphysite patriarchates of alexandria and antioch that have also split with constantinople . 
  the church of armenia is n't connected to the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople . 
  it 's miaphysite and already split with constantinople in late antiquity . 
  the same is true for many syriac christians and the copts of egypt . 
   wow . 
  this is the best movie i have ever seen and it will probably the best one of all time . 
  i have got a pre-theater copy from a friend of mine . 
  from the start to end , the movie was perfect . 
  i like the scene where the main character steps on the earth from the heaven with holy light and save the people against poverty and suffer , while the people of west understands his extensive power and , at the same time , his destiny to be the one . 
  the film ends with similar enthusiasm and glory , as the main character rise back to heaven and directly talking the god via phone . 
  since there can not a better movie , i give a perfect score of 1/10 . 
  thank you . 
   if you think this or this is european then i am speechless . 
  because extreme displays of violent nationalism are unheard of in europe ? 
  so is holding the president of the united states to the same standards as some random joes on reddit the new normal now ? 
  yes , as soon as they stopped speaking a turkic language and adopted the slavic language of their new subjects , began to intermarry with them and became virtually indistinguishable from them they stopped being a turkic people and assimilated into the new slavo-bulgarian society . 
  this kind of ethnogenesis is extremely common in early medieval europe as well as in the steppes of eurasia and has almost nothing to do with concepts of blood relatedness that are often so important to modern nationalist identities . 
  by the way , the article about turkic peoples you linked to defines them like this :  the turkic peoples are a collection of ethnic groups that live in central , eastern , northern , and western asia as well as parts of eastern europe . 
  ** they speak languages belonging to the turkic language family ** . 
  they share , to varying degrees , certain cultural traits and historical backgrounds . 
  the term turkic represents a broad ethno - ** linguistic ** group of peoples including existing societies such as ... the comparison about yourself is obviously flawed , but whatever , i 'll bite . 
  no , the fact that you speak english does n't make you a member of the english people . 
  but if you move to england , learn the language , marry an english man or woman , assimilate into english society and acquire british citizenship there would be no need to not consider you and especially your descendants english . 
  what ? 
  what i mean is exactly what i wrote : proto-bulgars are labeled as a turkic people because they spoke a turkic language . 
  dna studies yield no informations about what kind of language they spoke so i do n't see how such studies could possibly discredit the assertion that the proto-bulgars were a turkic people . 
   not sure what dna studies are supposed to prove considering that the designation `` turkic '' only relates to what kind of language the original ( proto - ) bulgars were speaking . 
  not sure what dna studies are supposed to prove considering that the designation `` turkic '' only relates to what kind of language the original ( proto - ) bulgars were speaking . 
  neither is your map of much help as it only shows that bulgars migrated into europe from central asia , a region populated by several turkic speaking groups . 
  maybe you should elaborate a little more . 
  [ this seems to be changing for some time now . 
  ] ( http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/bundestagswahl-2017-rot-rot-gruene-sondierungen-aid-1.6458011 ) by the way : vatican city ? 
  he clearly said that something happend in sweden `` last night '' when in reality nothing actually happened . 
  he obviously did say something false . 
  so to sum up : * the man ca n't differentiate between something playing on tv and something actually happening at the moment , * seems to get most of his information from television although he is president of the united states , * and constantly conflates migrant - , refugee - and terror issues as if they are one and the same . 
  again : great !, 
  i bet he 's just a fan of donald tusk . 
  but again , him watching something on tv about sweden last night and something actually happening in sweden last night are not the same thing . 
  and he also mentions brussels , nice and paris in the same context , all scenes of recent terror attacks . 
  why would he do that if he did n't want to suggest that something similar happend in sweden ? 
  wait , where did he ask if they saw the segment ? 
  did he even directly mention that he was talking about something he saw on tv ? 
  all i 'm hearing is this :  you look at what 's happening last night , in sweden . 
  claiming that this refers to something he watched on tv is as much conjecture as saying that he is hinting at a terror attack . 
  so to him watching a segment on tv about sweden and something actually happening in sweden are the same thing ? 
  great !, 
   because the people of crimea wanted to be a part of russia again only if you consider a referendum held while russian soldiers were occupying the penisula , [ in which probably only a minority of crimeans took part ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/05/06/russian-government-agency-reveals-fraudulent-nature-of-the-crimean-referendum-results/?utm_term=.971071d48f83 ) , while on the other hand [ even russians from outside crimea were allowed to vote ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20140317082713/http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/voting-in-crimean-referendum-starts-even-as-ukraine-government-declares-it-illegitimate-339523.html ) to be a legitimate expression of the will of the people . 
  the sanctions against russia are n't just in place to punish it for an invasion but to force it to change its current policy towards ukraine . 
  russia still occupies crimea and still supports the separatists in eastern ukraine . 
  once it stops doing so the sanctions can be lifted . 
  on the other hand the us and britain are n't occupying iraq right now , so what would sanctions against them even accomplish ? 
  i think you missunderstood eachother . 
  macron 's website being hacked was the thing that had no actual impact on french society . 
  maybe you should read his comment again . 
  [ obligarory . 
  i also could n't find any studies on this specific topic but to be fair that does n't support your numbers either . 
  and considering that the numbers of serbs murdered or expelled from the ndh also seem to be in the range of several houndred thousands , i 'd say 200 000 to 300 000 forced conversions are n't all that unrealistic . 
  but do n't you consider the fact that fighters in the homeland war used a phrase with such connotations and by that linked themselves and their fight with the usta\u0161e regime pretty bad in its own right ? 
  it seems to considerably muddy croatia 's ability to come to terms with its ww2 past and gives an excuse to actual fascists using this kind of symbolism to glorify a very vile movement . 
  it also unnecessarily makes it easier for some serb nationalists to claim that modern croatia is just another usta\u0161e state . 
  true . 
  i do n't want to be rude but i 'd also like to know your sources for that claim , considering it does n't fit the things that i 've read on the topic . 
  john r. lampe writes on page 211 of his * yugoslavia as history . 
  twice there was a country ( cambridge 2000 ) * that roughly one-quarter million serbs ~ ~ accepted forced conversion ~ ~ were forced to convert to catholicism between 1941 and 42 . 
  as i consider him as well as yad vashem very reliable , i 'd say you 're on the right track here . 
  edit : see below . 
  and how is this evidence for anyone getting payed to do this ? 
  i guess this is more likely referring to a comment lavrov made in 2015 and which is even mentioned in the article :  in 2015 , russian foreign minister sergey lavrov suggested macedonia should be partitioned , with the west going to albania and the east being given to bulgaria . 
  his comments roughly coincided with a peak in the political crisis that had caught the country at the moment . 
  k , thanks . 
  what lie are you even talking about ? 
  i do accept the fact that those camps were build and operated by the german government . 
  yes , people learn history from movies ( and books i hope ) . 
  but they certainly do n't learn it from 10 second snippets from old obama speeches without any context whatsoever . 
  do you even watch german tv ? 
  ww2 documentaries are n't uncommon here at all and i have n't ever seen one that tried to imply that poland would have been responsible for the death camps located on its soil . 
  i can see how the phrase `` polish death camps '' would be confusing to someone who does n't know its context . 
  that 's why it 's important that we remember our history and germany as a hole is very dedicated to that . 
  so to claim german media is trying to `` whitewash '' our history by using that phrase sounds absolutely ridiculous to me and frankly reeks of manufactured controversy . 
  i have absolutely no idea how you were able to convince yourself that ard , zdf or obama were referring to anything else but the fact that those camps were located inside occupied poland . 
  everyone here is well aware that germany was 100 % responsible for the nazi concentration camps . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  that idiot-theory sure became more plausible . 
  does your definition of sane perchance only include you ?
