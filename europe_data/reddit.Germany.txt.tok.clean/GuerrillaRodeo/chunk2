  of course there 'd have to be certain laws and principles exempt from change due to popular vote , like it 's already in the constitution of germany ( dignity of man , rule of the people ) . 
  i understand everyone who has concerns about full-blown direct democracy . 
  maybe a system that incorporates elements of both direct and representative democracy would be best . 
  the pirates are proposing an interesting concept called ` liquid ' or ' [ delegative democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delegative_democracy ) ' , in which , to put it shortly , you ` lend ' your vote to a person who you think knows enough of the subject at hand to ultimately decide in your favour . 
  however , if you strongly disagree with your representative on one specific issue , you can simply take your vote back and vote for yourself . 
  i only wish our own pirate party was this successful . 
  they share the same core principles and have a very good platform themselves , but all they get is bad press ( `` communist crackpots '' , `` deluded nerds '' ) and a party brass that seems more obsessed with themselves and quite a lot of non-topics ( i agree that gender issues should be addressed appropriately , but the level of obsession with them by some party members is downright frightening ) . 
  i would vote for them * especially * because of the direct democracy part . 
  probably because they were n't asked in the first place . 
  merkel opened the doors on her own and now expects the rest of germany to pay for it . 
  our chancellor said this . 
  it should be obvious that she does n't speak for the entire german people . 
  her open invitation still had a devastating effect , though . 
  everyone should opt out of this . 
  merkel and her government have lost touch with reality . 
  summary : * german finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble has proposed an eu-wide ` solidarity surcharge ' to better cope with the ongoing refugee crisis . 
  it is discussed that it will be added to either mineral oil tax or vat . 
  * the money would be used to support ` border states ' such as italy or greece to better secure their borders ; another part of the money would go to the refugees ' respective countries of origin , to ensure their accommodation there . 
  * the height of the surcharge is not yet decided upon since there are no reliable calculations of how much the refugee crisis is going to eventually cost yet . 
  * germany has spent 20 bn $ on refugee accommodation so far . 
  * the surcharge would be the first of its kind - a unified , eu-wide tax , and a direct source of income for the eu , which to this day relies on financial backing from its member states .

  exactly my thoughts . 
  and given [ these headlines ] ( https://i.imgur.com/h7i676d.jpg ) of the most popular turkish newspapers as of recent , i think it 'd be only fitting if b\u00f6hmermann ( the author of the poem , who got sued by erdogan for l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 ) tried to sue those newspapers for slander . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  it would be worse if he would still adhere to his position from 15 years ago . 
  situations and circumstances change ( or , in this case , not very much ) , and not adapting your strategy or opinion on that matter would be very unwise . 
  interesting . 
  in many points , he is following the apologists that do n't want to recognise the genocide . 
  these are his most prominent points : * berlin and paris ( the french condemned the genocide just weeks earlier ) are not the places where this issue has to be addressed and processed - that is essentially ankara 's job . 
  * he suggest that as a wartime ally , imperial germany almost certainly knew of the genocide and that this issue had to be addressed in germany . 
  * diplomatic rifts and hints to our own bloody past are almost inevitable . 
  that was downright prophetic - it 's exactly what 's happening now . 
  * he quotes hrant dink , a prominent armenian newspaper editor living in istanbul , who was murdered by a turkish nationalist in 2007 : `` if only a single turk started to think about what has happened in the history of the armenians , this would mean more to me than millions of voices in the west openly condemning the genocide . 
  resolutions like the one passed in france are obstructing the democratic process in turkey - they invigorate nationalistic and anti-european powers . '', 
  * he goes on about the possible eu accession of turkey , citing a turkish human rights official who was openly in favour of torture and the total lack of reintegration of or even outreach to pkk members ( who unilaterally declared to stop violent actions against the turkish state back then ) and that people in anatolia still go `` missing '' . 
  * the french resolution is met with skepticism even by some armenians , who ca n't figure out why france is showing an interest in their cause all of a sudden , fearing that french interests in the region are what ultimately led them to pass the law , not a genuine care for armenians . 
  * finally , \u00d6zdemir asks what the reasoning for a similar german resolution might be , bringing up punishment of turkey , reparations and reconciliation and a call towards turkey to finally face their past . 
  while he argues that the last point is obviously the most important , a german resolution would be a ` grave mistake ' since it would ultimately punish the armenians still living in turkey as well as the pro-europeans there since it would only reinforce hardliners . 
  he acknowledges though that without pressure from abroad , said hardliners could never be coerced into changing their course . 
  * he goes on to reiterate the disappearance of people in south-east turkey and poses general questions linked to freedom of speech , which were ( and still are ) pretty restrictive and could very well bar turkey from eu admission . 
  * \u00d6zdemir postulates that such a semi-authoritarian regime could never be coerced into acknowledging the genocide if other nations do exactly that . 
  instead , he argues for a turkish-armenian dialogue that is supposed to address these things and that in this light , any actions that could damage this dialogue had to be eschewed - such as passing a resolution or a law that acknowledges the genocide as what it is . 
  lol wut ~ ~ when ~ ~ if the new berlin airport is going to be opened one day they 'll have to add a new code anyway . 
  i dare them to bill us for that one , too . 
  russia is turning more and more into the national equivalent of a bond villain . 
  not `` maybe '' by globuli . 
  `` definitely not '' by globuli , because they just do n't work . 
  this has been established again and again . 
  maybe so , but exploiting one 's ignorance is ethically very dubious , to say the least . 
  i would even go as far and say that it 's basically preying on the weak . 
  yes , you are . 
  i am 100 % sure homoeopathy is ineffective and while it might have started off with good intentions ( people just did n't know any better back them ) , it gradually evolved into a massive globe-spanning , multi-billion dollar swindle . 
  see my other post . 
  the globuli did n't help , it was their own immune system that took care of it - they just wrongly attributed it to them . 
  the problem is that by selling homoeopathic medicine , you 're actively priming and training those people to rely on it for a wider range of illnesses . 
  sure , if you have a cold and eat globuli , you will indeed get better - but because of your own immune system , which we do n't just have for fun . 
  the problem is that people will wrongly attribute the recovery to the globuli - even though they would have become just healthy again in the same amount of time without eating sugar pills . 
  curing a cold takes seven days without a doctor and a week with one . 
  like you said , you 're mostly there for the interaction - which is also the main reason it apparently works . 
  i say ` apparently ' because there 's not a single shred of evidence that backs up the notion that homoeopathy by itself actually works . 
  how could it ? 
  sugar pills and water bottles that in many cases do n't even contain a single molecule of the original agent do n't do anything - and even if it were n't so strongly diluted , the principle ` similia similibus curentur ' - like cures like - is just profoundly wrong . 
  according to this principle , i should eat lead if i had anaemia because lead also causes anaemia and similar ( or even the same ) symptoms . 
  in my opinion , there are two main reasons why people turn to homoeopathy - firstly because they ( believe that they ) get more attention from homoeopaths ( which may be true , given the rather tight schedule most doctors are on ) and secondly due to the placebo effect - which is a thing , i admit , but is negligible when compared to actual medicine and has a certain religious character to it , like you said . 
  personal anecdotes have no value in science though - because they ca n't be reproduced , something that is possible with studies . 
  from a capitalistic point of view , it makes perfect sense - if the demand is there , why not cater to it ? 
  people are obviously willing to spend lots of money on it . 
  from an ethical point of view though it 's highly questionable . 
  actively promoting homoeopathy by using fundamentally wrong terms and buzzwords describing an objectively false mechanism is akin to lying in my opinion , especially if the patient has a low scientific educational background . 
  i think that 's a profound conflict of interest manufacturers and sellers of homoeopathic remedies are in - you know that it does n't work , but if you tell your customers you 're sure to lose them . 
  personally , i could not bend and twist my conscience that much and sacrifice my moral integrity that way . 
  an irrational system built on nothing but lies that has harmed and even killed millions of people and , unfortunately , is still going strong today . 
  i 'm not proud to admit that [ one of my countrymen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_hahnemann ) invented homeopathy . 
  the first fully programmable digital [ computer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/z3_%28computer%29 ) and the [ telephone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reis_telephone ) . 
  to this day , most of the praise goes to alexander graham bell and whoever created the eniac , but it was actually germans who invented them first . 
  franken is not really bavaria anymore , but still not fischkopfland either . 
  what are you ? 
  we 're to the rest of germany what scotland is to the rest of the uk . 
  also talking about the past . 
  ca n't think of a single instance where cdu/csu started an inquiry under schr\u00f6der . 
  and why is it always die linke and die gr\u00fcnen who initiate these inquiries ? 
  i ca n't think of a single instance where cdu/csu or spd took the initiative . 
  he apparently [ tried to lure young people to the mcdonald 's where the shooting started ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/mutmasslicher-taeter-von-muenchen-was-ueber-den-schuetzen-bekannt-ist-1.3091964 ) via a fake facebook account ( `` come to mcd 's at the oez mall , i 'll buy a round '' ) , which inexplicably had a few dozen friends . 
  one politician is not nearly enough to make up for the dozens of others that blame video games for everything from school shooters to the demise of the occident . 
  besides , heiko maas is one of the worst examples you could possibly quote . 
  he may be a member of the spd , but his stances on inner security , video games and the internet are 120 % cdu . 
  i never defended the greens . 
  besides , citing a * 30 year old * party programme is just ridiculous , especially if you consider the fact that angela merkel 's statement is only four years old , back when everyone and their dog already had smartphones . 
  i explicitly excluded ` dictatorships and other autocracies ' . 
  and please , tell me more about having games screened for their ` art ' character . 
  not a sarcastic request , i 'm genuinely interested in the process . 
  the cdu has proven time and again what civil liberties mean to them . 
  the very law they passed this week is yet another sad example of that - they do embrace technology , but only if it serves their cause of widening surveillance . 
  i see this as the plain pr stunt it is . 
  i bet they would n't have touched the issue at all if it were n't election year . 
  be that as it may , but her claim was objectively false . 
  and that woman is a legislator !, 
  she had already been in office for * eight years * back then .
