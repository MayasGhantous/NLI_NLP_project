  include promulgation of the notion ` islamophobia ' . 
  i think the term may have emerged from us and uk [ student politics ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/the-new-intolerance-of-student-activism-at-yale/414810/ ) . 
  examples are the yale halloween costume campaign and the wider rhodes must fall campaign . 
  i 've also noticed the terms ` regressive leftists ' and ` beta leftists ' being used by those described as the neoconservative and neoreactionary and whatever milo yiannopolous is . 
  i think you 'll find it is racism against east asians and southeast asians . 
  no idea why , but this is played out in australia . 
  it 's not scaremongering , professor mark blyth says the same if you look at a few of his [ lectures ] ( https://youtu.be/x2vufjswn2w ) and [ talks ] ( https://youtu.be/rgvzil0qwpg ) . 
  when has time spent in a committee been valuable in any walk of life ? 
  like german soccer joy or worse ? 
  how 's that going to work for australia and its state flags and territories like the cook islands , and some canadian province flags , and new zealand , fiji , tuvalu , hawaii , falkland islands and so on ? 
  all the non european identities that the uk dumped for the fancy pants european identity ? 
  lot of flag problems and associated legislation to fix . 
  on the bright side that 's a lot of creative design work . 
  i know . 
  was being sarcastic - sorry . 
  true . 
  and there is a trend for healthy women to store their eggs because it 's hard to find husbands and build nests before 30 . 
  young men these days ... 
  is truth demonstrated by the harvesting of the eggs when the daughter already knew she was seriously ill ? 
  having eggs ripened using medication and collected with an ultrasound guided needle is quite a deliberate and unpleasant process . 
  if the daughter was an only child i bet they talked about it . 
  it is hard to imagine they would n't have . 
  same thing that would have happened had those eggs been 38 weeks older . 
  our greatly increased life expectancy makes this very possible . 
  two older experienced , financially secure parent-grandparents is a good environment for child raising . 
  they should consider having two kids rather than just one though . 
  i do n't understand his position based on :  implementation of union legislation `` under primary law , the eu has only limited powers of enforcement , as eu law is usually enforced by the member states . 
  furthermore , article 291 ( 1 ) tfeu adds that ** member states shall adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement legally binding union acts ** . 
  where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding union acts are needed , the commission exercises its implementing powers ( article 291 ( 2 ) tfeu ) . '', 
  see page 4 of http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ftu/pdf/en/ftu_1.2.1.pdf, 
  doubt it . 
  germany continues to lack moderation in its politics . 
  look past the policies to see the rocking of the boat . 
  wow . 
  seven million more women than men were left to do that . 
  does inflammatory language and rhetoric lead to violence or not ? 
  left wingers , centrists and fascist anti fascists ca n't have it both ways . 
  and encourage it by donating to [ antoine deltour ] ( https://support-antoine.org/en/ ) and [ raphael halet 's ] ( https://www.lepotcommun.fr/pot/imv3ux2z ) support funds to cover the legal costs . 
  you say that like there 's a vast array of options . 
  saw a soros merkel clinton nightmare youtube video today : https://youtu.be/fegxik--odm, 
  here 's an example , no eu tariff would save australian winemakers $ 58 million per year and increase their market share . 
  the largest recipient of british migrants is australia . 
  i suppose we could fly in the face of commonsense and avenge the uk 's betrayal of australia when it joined the eec/eu . 
  yes , agree on that . 
  i think the remainers have lost perspective on the road to utopia . 
  at the same time the lisbon treaty was being negotiated , new zealand ( population of 4.5 million and producers of the world 's best comedy ) , were finalising a free trade agreement with china . 
  when you buy lamb in the netherlands and germany have a look where it 's produced . 
  edit : australia , a third of the population of the uk , negotiated an fta with the us in 2005 . 
  here 's a list of [ au ftas ] ( http://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/pages/status-of-fta-negotiations.aspx ) . 
  was joke . 
  it has already happened and continues to happen . 
  the worst example to my mind is mechanised muster and slaughter in factory farming and processing . 
  i wo n't include a link to photos of that . 
  go look up the definition of that logical fallacy and look at ` strawman ' while you 're there . 
  the point is about the tone of political speech and i 'm saying that branding everyone who opposes mass immigration or muslim immigration or rapid economic restructuring as a nazi racist bigoted moron is also guilty of `` angry , fierce speeches '' spreading hatred . 
  and yet nobody blames those politicians for fortuyn 's assassination , a double standard , so why do you and others blame farage for the assassination of cox ? 
  eurovision this year had an [ interpretative dance ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jyuofhfremw ) about it , so if swedish choreographers know about it , i 'd say the cat is out of the bag . 
  [ pim fortuyn ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pim_fortuyn ) was assasinated by a nutter who claimed to act for dutch muslims and yet without any muslims knowing of his intentions or organising it with him . 
  he thought he was killing a nazi because of the way fortuyn was constantly labelled by his opponents and by the media - and in spite of the fact fortuyn was a long time left identifying intellectual and openly gay . 
  the fact you do n't know this refutes your argument entirely . 
  or bring them out of retirement or call on australia 's army of trade negotiators . 
  australian wine competes for significant market share with other exporting countries that benefit from a zero tariff rate . 
  the elimination of tariffs for australian wines would save an estimated $ 58 million per year and increase that market share . 
  i can see the rejection of australia more clearly now . 
  i read this [ marina hyde opinion ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/28/nigel-farage-european-parliament-petty-rant-ukip ) in the guardian today about nigel farage and it is 1,000 words of schoolyard nastiness and bullying - and i thought no wonder australian politicians and others are treated with such snobbery and class based derision in the uk . 
  so , i 'm pleased to tap that republican spirit now . 
  australian in germany here . 
  i would love to see an op ed rant from an australian in the british media on how australia was screwed over so the uk could join the eec . 
  the oldies in my family call it a betrayal . 
  australian farmers and producers still suffer due to the tariffs . 
  all the carry on about how they 're european now but by far the largest number to this very day emigrate to australia and new zealand . 
  zero acknowledgement , keep taking us for granted . 
  but what is massively pissing me off is the last time the so called losers , the human garbage and the jobless were economically structured out of british society they dumped them in australia along with their political dissidents - special shout out to scotland and ireland for forgetting that too . 
  of course there was n't a labour party back then to represent them - oh , that 's right , there is n't one now . 
  no , i 'm serious , but we should n't break democracy for shallow trudeau minions . 
  in australia the candidates are [ rotated on the ballot paper ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/robson_rotation ) to eliminate this problem . 
  omg . 
  i see your concern . 
  affluence and peacetime makes us stupid . 
  yes . 
  everyone 's experience of their own society is valuable and worthy of a vote in a democracy whether they know it or not . 
  plus it 's fucking annoying to have the debate relentlessly interrupted by faux leftwing uk anchor babies doing their online petitioning and twee tantruming when they actually disenfranchised themselves . 
  i know !, 
  i am just amazed at what the british left and labour party has become . 
  this is one of the most important outcomes of brexit for the uk , the question of the legitimacy of labour ( none ) and the union movement ( there 's redeemable minority ) . 
  the left and the fashionable people are fighting for the establishment and sneering at the human garbage who got out and voted . 
  it 's anger toward the centre expressing itself . 
  exactly , it 's garden variety politics as usual . 
  poor scotland , on the wrong side of history again . 
  i think there is a global , historical perspective being lost as we focus on the politics like the leadership struggles now underway and the ` will they or wo n't they ' re article 50 . 
  we forget why those who have been experiencing the pointy end of the forces of globalisation voted to leave . 
  british commenters jump all over australians who dare to have an opinion on brexit and the eu ( not just reddit , try commenting in the guardian fellow australian europeans ) , however they should remember that australia exists because of the massive forces of societal change caused by the industrial revolution in britain - massive wealth creation where the wealth was not fairly distributed or redistributed , and those in power did not recognise or respond to growing displacement , dispossession and the anger of ordinary people . 
  the establishment lost that time too . 
  i thought the uprising was underway in france , but it 's started first in the uk as it happened last time . 
  the new luddites of brexit . 
  as an australian and having worked in the subject area years ago , that is spot on , the people smuggling trade is very sensitive to ** market signals ** . 
  and merkel was just so belligerently naive . 
  it is very much supply and demand , but organised by big illegal business interests and political interests . 
  no , not for the domestic audience , it was a message to ordinary germans . 
  he clearly blamed merkel for the migrant crisis and warns of job losses in the car making industry if tariffs are imposed .
