  he gets a roar of applause when he complains about political union by stealth and deception . 
  conservatives such as peter hitchens believe the eu is a project developing a german hegemony . 
  that is such a shame but how can they be blamed for opting out when even left leaning media like the guardian encouraged this type of thinking with op eds arguing exactly that by popular , high profile celebrities like comedian [ david mitchell ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/29/eu-referendum-parliament-leaders-david-cameron-david-mitchell ) . 
  he said stupid things and repeated the words of other big names such as , `` but dawkins 's words gave me solace . 
  he said : `` it is an outrage that people as ignorant as me are being asked to vote . 
  this is a complicated matter of economics , politics , history , and we live in a representative democracy not a plebiscite democracy . '', 
  so , there are two well educated and in all other respects brilliant british adults ignorant of the role of politics and the power of politics . 
  just checked that 90 % turnout theory and australia has n't had a voter turnout lower than 90 % since complusory voting was introduced in 1924 - you must be right . 
  91.2 % of eligible voters are registered to vote , so about 1,392,000 are missing from the roll . 
  bludgers . 
  the australian electoral commission puts the [ for and against arguments ] ( http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/compulsory_voting.htm ) on its website :  arguments used in favour of compulsory voting * voting is a civic duty comparable to other duties citizens perform e.g. 
  taxation , compulsory education , jury duty * teaches the benefits of political participation * parliament reflects more accurately the `` will of the electorate '' * governments must consider the total electorate in policy formulation and management * candidates can concentrate their campaigning energies on issues rather than encouraging voters to attend the poll * the voter is n't actually compelled to vote for anyone because voting is by secret ballot . 
   arguments used against compulsory voting : * it is undemocratic to force people to vote -- an infringement of liberty * the ill informed and those with little interest in politics are forced to the polls * it may increase the number of `` donkey votes '' * it may increase the number of informal votes * it increases the number of safe , single-member electorates -- political parties then concentrate on the more marginal electorates * resources must be allocated to determine whether those who failed to vote have `` valid and sufficient '' reasons . 
  i 'm caught between two thoughts on the brexit result , that the will of the electorate is not accurately reflected and the will of the politically motivated and non bludgers is the will of the people and has therefore been accurately reflected . 
  in australia there 's a small fine and 95 % turnout . 
  as far as i know there is no precedent for this . 
  there is no such thing as a ` lame duck ' prime minister in the westminster system . 
  it 's all or nothing and that is the stability of it , if power shifts so does the leadership . 
  the position of prime minister is not directly elected by the people , so the election cycle does not matter , it is about confidence and stability . 
  the office of pm is not established by any constitution or law but exists only by long-established convention , which stipulates that the monarch must appoint as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the house of commons ; typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . 
  australia has the same system of government , well , that was until the uk joined the eec/eu and started giving itself away in terms of sovereignty . 
  so , up until the brexit referendum result was announced australia was more historically british in its form of government than the uk . 
  my point is cameron should not have announced his resignation unless he was actually going . 
  the uk does n't want to be consumed with leadership speculation and calls for a snap election until october , but this is what will happen after the labor leadership spill is finished . 
  the media is already shortlisting for cameron 's replacement . 
  maybe australians should remind their eu friends of the extraordinary economic and social costs of the eec/eu forcing the uk to abandon its relationship with australia and new zealand as a price of membership . 
  not a happy or just story . 
  it turns out australia has a stronger democracy based on ancient british doctrine than the uk nowadays . 
  no-one in australia would fuck with the result of a referendum for example , and a pm would not give four months notice of his resignation . 
  these changes would be immediate and brutal , with no reservation about respecting the will of the people . 
  this is how the eu and mass immigration has changed british democracy and eroded its sovereignty and self confidence . 
  furthermore , prior to the uk joining the eec/eu the uk had close and preferential arrangements with australia and new zealand . 
  i for one am looking forward to those connections being restored . 
  i was saying it is impossible to have a free , fair and tolerant society without the average voter . 
  in fact , i support compulsory voting for this reason . 
  average voters are bolsheviks ?? 
  you are being humourful , ja ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibraltar_sovereignty_referendum,_2002 gibraltar had a referendum on this in 2002 . 
  88 % voter turnout . 
  98 % said no to joint sovereignty . 
  yes .

  bugger off where ? 
  into the bosom of german hegemony ? 
  why would n't you want to be free , outward looking and independent like the rest of the english speaking world ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
  can you explain the emotion of it a bit more for me ? 
  there are lots of other countries outside of europe . 
  australia and new zealand will get the uk back after decades . 
  the uk and india have strong connections and can now get going on a free trade agreement . 
  is n't it more a question about ensuring meaningful democracy ? 
  how could you have a free , fair and tolerant society that is at the same time beyond the capacity of the average voter to judge or participate in ? 
  can you please fix the link to your quote so i can explore my stupidity ? 
  i do n't mind being corrected . 
  do you believe london has an atheist majority or a christian majority ? 
  i 'm still baffled by your comment . 
  there was a christian majority at the time of the last census in 2011 .

  yes , khan 's office should have immediately ruled that possibility out or at least uttered the words ` british labor party ' or ` premature ' . 
  the opportunism and sectarianism is alarming . 
  there appears to be joint discussion by scotland 's first minister , nicola sturgeon , and the london mayor , sadiq khan , to secure some kind of referendum opt-out for both scotland and london . 
  and here is what sturgeon said as reported at 12.08 pm by [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-result-live-counting-leave-remain-brain-in-europe ) :  `` i have also spoken this morning with [ london ] mayor sadiq khan and he is clear that he shares this objective for london , so there is clear common cause between us .

  australian voter turnout sits at about 95 % . 
  i can assure you that about 30 % of people being too disenfranchised to vote makes a shitload of difference to a society and it is not possible to guess how they would vote . 
  however , we do know from uk and us voter turnout that non voters are poor , less educated and working class . 
  as this is the biggest voter turnout in the uk since 1997 a lot of people thought their vote was game changing this time round - so , what has happened since 1997 that has stirred this usually silent group to use their voice ? 
  ignoring the result of a referendum would be unprecedented . 
  i can see what cameron is doing . 
  if cameron said out loud and explained that this was his intention , ` this result is not binding ' , i bet there would be riots and violence . 
  everyday he remains in office not acting on the referendum result degrades british democracy and foments division and disorder . 
  could cameron choose a more destabilizing path ? 
  that 's dangerous given the heightened tensions . 
  people have been saying that for how long now ? 
  the more things change the more they stay the same . 
  there 's still a living jacobite pretender , so nicola should give [ franz of bavaria ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz,_duke_of_bavaria ) a call . 
  that 's australian culture talking - compulsory voting - and that 's why australia does n't get into these problems in the first place . 
  even prisoners vote . 
  that 's why we ca n't understand it . 
  less lofty stuff like 100 % control of their fisheries is what is meant by issues of sovereignty . 
  border control is another . 
  they 've been talking a lot of bullshit in the uk if it 's not . 
  i expect there are the usual gaps between what is literally written down and the effect and the perception of it .

  i suppose albania could undo that as part of the process of joining the eu .
