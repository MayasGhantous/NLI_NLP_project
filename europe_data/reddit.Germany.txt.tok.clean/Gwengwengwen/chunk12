  or the oic cairo declaration could be revised and updated . 
  do you know more about it ? 
  i am restricted to english and german searches . 
  i 'm saying billy bragg 's lived experience as a working class boy growing up in barking 30 years later would have changed him and his politics - i was pointing at generational change and using two well known working class voices to make that comparison . 
  i can only repeat my earlier statement that this is not about old fashioned conceptions of racism or at the individual level as portrayed in sitcoms like love thy neighbour . 
  using billy bragg 's lyrics as my reply , `` that brutality and the economy are related now i understand '' . 
  to not understand the insolubility of aspects of culture and religion and the identity of class and ethnicity , and to dishonestly portray it as a dilemma between racists and non racists fought out at the individual level is as foolish as it is irrational . 
  it is not about me as an individual migrant in germany or about an individual migrant in london , these are powerful societal forces . 
  i know all his songs including his recent material . 
  saw him in the 90s after a decade of being a fan in my formative years , been to his gigs , i love his passion and his spirit for justice . 
  i taught my kids to sing this [ one ] ( https://youtu.be/xjua3ru4b8e ) . 
  my admiration of him extends to the more recent [ there will be a reckoning ] ( https://youtu.be/zotoywc6nre ) . 
  what do you think i missed ? 
  edit : removed a personal bit in my comments, 
  albania is a member of the [ oic ] ( http://www.oic-oci.org/oicv3/page/?p_id=52&amp;p_ref=26&amp;lan=en ) as is turkey . 
  i 'm not sure how an oic member with such a different definition of [ human rights ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cairo_declaration_on_human_rights_in_islam ) and terrorism could be an eu member . 
  happy for someone to educate me , but i do n't see how the eu could incorporate islamic shariah law definitions unless those definitions are coincidentally the same - which of course , inherently , they can not be . 
  yep . 
  retro trade unionists and socialists find it hard to distinguish between internationalism and supranationalism , bless them . 
  that 's ironic given what 's happened to the [ british working class ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/britains-great-divide/ ) . 
  if billy bragg were 30 years younger he would n't been fighting again fascist thatcher and the neoliberal agenda , he 'd be in tommy robinson 's shoes . 
  [ leave her johnny ] ( https://youtu.be/4fvqwzv5qfc ) . 
  that was a fundamentally different question , yes ? 
  it was a question of whether or not to accept bailout conditions , not a question of sovereignty . 
  totally agree with you there . 
  the fate of charles i comes to mind . 
  i reckon the queen would sack the pm , dissolve the parliament and call an election if such a scenario threatened to emerge . 
  are you suggesting the british parliament would ignore the will of the people ? 
  and the queen would permit that ? 
  i ca n't even imagine that - unless immigration has so radically changed the society . 
  i saw this german news [ article ] ( http://m.welt.de/politik/ausland/article156407529/beim-brexit-duerfte-das-parlament-das-volk-ignorieren.html ) yesterday and it seemed to me to lack understanding of british culture . 
  britain is a very old democracy unlike germany . 
  oh shit , i see why eye catching is needed . 
  europe has recorded the highest number of [ newly diagnosed hiv infections ] ( http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/news_dispform.aspx?id=1330&amp;list=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&amp;source=http%3a%2f%2fecdc%2eeuropa%2eeu%2fen%2fhealthtopics%2faids%2fpages%2findex%2easpx ) in one year since the start of reporting in the 1980s . 
   `` rates of hiv diagnoses have more than doubled in bulgaria , the czech republic , hungary , malta and slovakia and have increased by more than 50 % in poland . 
  on the other hand , rates decreased in 11 countries between 2005 and 2014 , with decreases of more than 25 % observed in austria , estonia , france , the netherlands , portugal and the united kingdom . 
  two in three new hiv infections are among native-born europeans , while foreign-born individuals represent one third of hiv diagnoses . '', 
  and there was a big nude swim in tasmania , australia yesterday marking the [ winter solstice ] ( http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-21/dark-mofo-nude-swimmers-in-dash-and-splash-for-winter-solstice/7528168 ) . 
  eeew . 
  i 'm an australian who 's ethnically shoreditch-ish , so what 's happened to the place since the 1880s ? 
  i visited in 1990 and it was still working class with a little bit of multiculturalism . 
  i visited the street with my family 's surname and it had the same businesses as 100 years earlier . 
  now it 's full of twats ? 
  the question is more why does germany think any other country would want to join its aspergers inspired social policy and not protect its own interests ? 
  seriously , do we pretend that france , belgium , the netherlands , sweden , austria , the uk and germany are not expressing game changing social unrest at the moment ? 
  we have more warning signals than we could possibly need . 
  that is what the rise of the right wing and the revival of nationalism means . 
  because we do n't want to be lebanon . 
  hands up who wants to be a non muslim in previously secular and christian majority lebanon and live through civil wars and cultural division for decades ? 
  i 'll quote from a d\u00fcsseldorf uni criminologist who has been blogging on the migrant crisis , professor andrew hammel :  `` one thing that actually does affect germany is who gets to enter the country . 
  and here , erdogan is showing his talent for statecraft . 
  after successfully extorting billions of euros from europe by exploiting the migrant crisis , he is now setting his sights on offloading problem cases onto europe . 
  under the recent agreement between the eu and germany , the eu has agreed to resettle one syrian refugee for every refugee sent back from greece to turkey by boat . 
   and turkey is doing something clever . 
  relying on rights it was granted as part of the agreement , turkey is yanking healthy syrians with college degrees and/or valuable skills out of the ` resettlement to europe ' line and canceling their exit permits . 
  the uneducated and those with expensive diseases , on the other hand , are free to go . 
  they will land in germany and promptly integrate into the german welfare state , racking up billions in medical costs -- yes , billions -- that the german taxpayer -- not the turkish taxpayer -- will have to finance . 
   one might denounce this policy as cruel or cynical , and no doubt german journalists will . 
  but of this there 's no doubt : it is in turkey 's national interest . 
  turkish voters are no doubt just as ignorant as voters anywhere else . 
  but they understand that inviting skilled workers who will find jobs or create jobs and pay taxes is in turkey 's interest . 
   erdogan has a plan , and is pursuing it . 
  germany 's immigration priorities seem to change every week . 
  germany is as ruthless as any other country in economic policy ( see bayer contemplating the purchase of monsanto , the punching-bag of german journalists since 1985 ) . 
  but for some reason , germany can not seem to figure out what its interests are in refugee policy , or how or even whether to pursue them . '', 
  i would argue that the tax free status of those donations - as you point out are largely from businesses - makes those donations publicly subsidised . 
  so , they can refuse that aspect of eu money too if they want to be all pure about it . 
  again , what exactly is the responsibility of the eu has to alleviate turkey 's problems that are n't the responsibility of the other neighbouring countries or wealthy gulf nations ? 
  do you know much about demographics ? 
  the majority of that 500 million of europe are n't young men . 
  about 20 % are currently over 65 and only 15 % are children . 
  in turkey 29 % are children for a point of comparison . 
  in germany the arrival of so many young foreign males means that in that same age group ethnic german men are now outnumbered and there are not enough german females in that same age group . 
  aside from the obvious problem , this also causes more crime and violence . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:population_age_structure_by_major_age_groups,_2004_and_2014_ ( % 25_of_the_total_population ) _ yb15.png europe has a fertility rate of 1.38 . 
  to maintain europe as we have known it the fertility rate needs to be 2.1 + . 
  in my kid 's high school in germany in a so-called very german town about 75 % of the senior students are ethnic germans , however in the city kindergarten only 50 % or less are ethnic germans . 
  if you have migrants arriving who are accustomed to living in poverty and who can easily adapt to a welfare income , especially welfare and accommodation which pays extra for each child born , then your welfare state is providing an incentive for a higher birthrate in its welfare dependent class . 
  what about migrants who arrive with a religious imperative to have as many children as possible ? 
  simply put , no country should be forced or shamed into allocating parts of its territory to create a parallel society or colony because of instability in another region or whatever reason - persecuted individuals and their families and climate change refugees are the only exceptions to my mind . 
  temporary protection is one thing , but mass permanent resettlement is another . 
  i do not disagree with you at all , it does excellent work in desperate conditions and dangerous places , but it is not within its remit to chastise donors and refuse legitimate donations . 
  it will also offend citizens of those eu countries and may lead to a drop in donations . 
  i 'm going on the 2015 figures . 
  my point was it is n't that much in comparison to individual and business donations from eu and other western country citizens - and where are the donations from the wealthiest countries in the world and their governments ? 
  probably could have made that clearer though . 
  seriously , why is the eu being forced to take responsibility for this and being shamed for the massive contribution it has already made which in germany alone is being [ forecast to cost ] ( http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0y50dy ) almost 1 trillion euros by 2020 ? 
  it is a very political position to take . 
  just looking at its [ 2015 annual report ] ( http://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/msf_financial_report_2015.pdf ) this rejected funding of 63 million euros appears to represent 11 % of its funding . 
  to put that in perspective , they spend 18 % on admin and fundraising . 
  perhaps msf could get some funding from the moral high ground in the wealthy gulf states - see page 27 of the report to see the list of donors . 
  that 's from the [ leaked police report ] ( http://m.bild.de/bild-plus/politik/inland/bundeskriminalamt/der-bka-bericht-44587004,var=a,view=conversiontologin.bildmobile.html ) `` crime in the context of immigration '' ( kriminalit\u00e4t im kontext von zuwanderung ) . 
  the data in the report was incomplete and did not include nrw , hamburg and bremen . 
  professor hammel stated :  '' ... police statistics do not offer a clear breakdown of what they mean by migrants . 
  once again , this is a question that could be settled by clear , comprehensive crime statistics . 
  which , if you ask me , is precisely why german police agencies and politicians intentionally fail to collect and publish clear , comprehensive crime statistics . '', 
  according to the leaked police report on crime in 2015 , most of the crimes were committed by migrants from : syria ( 24 % ) , albania ( 17 % ) , kosovo ( 14 % ) , serbia ( 11 % ) , afghanistan ( 11 % ) , iraq ( 9 % ) , eritrea ( 4 % ) , macedonia ( 4 % ) , pakistan ( 4 % ) and nigeria ( 2 % ) . 
  not really eastern europe is it ? 
  d\u00fcsseldorf university criminologist [ professor andrew hammel ] ( http://www.jura.hhu.de/en/dozenten/hammel/prof-andrew-hammel-llm-harvard.html ) wrote on his blog in february this year :  `` as i 've pointed out many times before , german police agencies do a terrible job of reporting crime statistics . 
  in fact , they frequently do a non-existent job of reporting them , since many police reports about specific kinds of crime are kept secret .
