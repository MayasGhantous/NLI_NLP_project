  thanks, 
  that looks a lot like spadework to censor wikileaks in the run up to the german elections . 
  `` a new and disturbing factor emerged during the us presidential campaign , one that may change elections forever : democracies are at the mercy of hacking and surveillance technologies , and of those who control them . 
  already there are disturbing signs that this may affect germany 's federal elections in september 2017 . '', 
  from [ an article ] ( https://www.socialeurope.eu/2016/11/new-era-elections-decided-hackers-wikileaks/ ) entitled * the new leak-ocracy : elections decided by hackers and ( wiki ) leaks * . 
  [ hacks on german politicians and organisations ] ( http://m.dw.com/en/hacker-attacks-target-german-politicians/av-19567000 ) were reported in september . 
  i think this quote from [ european parliament news ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20161118sto51750/tackling-propaganda-\u201cit\u2019s-a-continuation-of-methods-used-during-the-cold-war\u201d ) explains why russia has been put in the same bucket as isis and islamic terrorist organisations and individuals , and that the purpose is preventing what happened during the us election with leaks exposing racism , corruption and those who put themselves above the law . 
  all whistleblowers are now russian and should be treated the same as islamofascist terrorists so counter-terrorism and radicalisation prevention measures can be used : `` there are many theories about what happened in the us , but do they have the power to affect elections in europe ? '' ... 
  `` we have tools that are at disposal of any eu member state to monitor social media and cases of radicalisation . 
  it 's of course a big effort , yet we are now aware of things thanks to a very open cooperation and information coming from the capitals . '', 
  look at power trying to protect itself from democracy . 
  edit : formatting, 
  which state ? 
  maybe legal definitions . 
  he was charged and convicted murder , a common-law offence , rather than with an offence under counter-terrorism legislation . 
  in [ sentencing remarks ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38076755 ) , the judge said : `` i have to consider schedule 21 of the criminal justice act 2003 . 
  there is no doubt that this murder was done for the purpose of advancing a political , racial and ideological cause , namely that of violent white supremacism and exclusive nationalism most associated with nazism and its modern forms . '', 
  assange and his colleagues are reliable sources of information . 
  i do n't know about any other stories or about thorn , i usually switch off much earlier than mentions of 9/11 or blaming jewish people for everything . 
  it 's not as strong as a belief , but i 'll keep an open mind because ... ockham 's razor . 
  found the interview : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kp7fklbrpkg i found 0:50 that his language was interesting and his nodding at 1:03 when he does n't answer the question . 
  what do you reckon , most likely source for dnc leak ? 
  in that race i was anti-clinton and anti-establishment and anti-globalist and anti-supranationalist and anti-corporatist and most importantly anti-corruption and pro-transparency . 
  the escalating conflict with russia and the classist rhetoric about trump and his constituency flipped me in the end to being pro-trump , but that 's australian culture for you . 
  i ca n't work out how many baddies are involved in the ukraine , but the vested interests suggest caution in believing the us or russia . 
  it was assange 's body language during an interview with a direct question about seth rich , wikileaks offered a reward for any info regarding the murder and i 've been following leftwing la journalist h.a. 
  goodman and leftwing australian journalist john pilger . 
  and obviously the frenetic the_donald . 
  thanks for posting !, 
  my favourite author . 
  i 'm not saying he is not super wealthy , but if you need to pay cash to get on the invitation lists to the elite 's parties you are not a part of the in-crowd . 
  do you not understand the dynamics of the tippy top of a society ? 
  who holds court and is a part of the court ? 
  trump is seen as the king of the new money , the merchant class , the whitetrash , the bogans . 
  the us aristocracy and intellectual class find him repellant and have said it out loud constantly for decades . 
  same dynamics in the uk for nigel farage . 
  if either of these politicians were in australian politics they would not be hitting this wall of unbridled snobbery and disdain . 
  he 's a wealthy outsider , he 's been ridiculed for decades as not being one of the ruling class club . 
  the editor of vanity fair celebrates the 25 year term of derision `` short fingered vulgarian '' by calling trump a `` feral forest animal '' in an article beginning , [ `` the myriad vulgarities of donald trump ... are not news to those of us who have been living downwind of him for any period of time '' .

  what texts ? 
  are n't you lucky that they 're ongoing !, 
  would [ a song ] ( https://youtu.be/wiarmmtudzq ) help ? 
  because laws , courts and other institutions are slow moving giants and reflect hundreds of years of accumulated german culture and its monocultural problems . 
  for example , how well has german law coped with all this public masturbation and indecency ? 
  the changes in society are fast paced and deeply foreign like changes in computer technology and social media . 
  so , in this particular case most people instinctively believe an offence had been committed , however it is essentially a new offence so it results in prosecution using a law designed to protect us from something else . 
  same as the assaults on nye in k\u00f6ln ; no law really fit the criminal activities because such mischief had not previously existed . 
  breath into a bag . 
  this soothing three hour testimony at the benghazi hearing might [ help you relax and pretend it 's not happening . 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fqjnpefrtle ) . 
  any idea how frightening that comment is ? 
  did you eat too much technocracy today ? 
  the law being out of step with community standards will always be a worthy aspect of the discussion . 
  if you know anything about legal proceedings you would know that without considering everything that the court was privy to none of us is capable of forming a well considered view . 
  so , i 'm thinking your objections are fallacious . 
  as i said ... 
  you want a discussion aligned with what is relevant to german judicial proceedings on this sub ? 
  your expectations may go unmet . 
  what ? 
  seth rich is not a theory , he was a 27 year old who was gunned down and the unsolved crime is not only statistically anomalous but circumstantially suspicious . 
  just a tip : you sound like an impervious , creepy hack without the ability for critical thinking . 
  can you think of lots of examples of muslim individuals in migrant communitues being able to speak out without fear of retribution or shunning ? 
  `` but what islamists use most is intimidation . 
  a survey conducted in france in may 2003 found that 77 percent of girls wearing the hijab said they did so because of physical threats from islamist groups . 
  a series in the newspaper liberation in 2003 documented how muslim women and girls in france who refuse to wear the hijab are insulted , rejected and often physically threatened by muslim males . 
  muslim women who try to rebel are considered `` whores '' and treated as outcasts . '', 
  [ source .

  [ i like that australians ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_sbt3_9djy4 ) exposed your corrupt , warmongering government to an elite and media class who could n't remember that ` pay for play ' is in fact bribery and corruption . 
  now , can you tell us who murdered dnc staffer and suspected [ whistleblower seth rich ? 
  ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/wesearchr/status/800935598991151105 ) well , shut up . 
  it 's ok because they lacked competence ? 
  and there was an absence of evidence of intimidation in the muslim community they were patrolling ? 
  i see . 
  they were trying to verbally and visually establish a territory within a state under a totalitarian system with rival laws and law enforcement and did so wearing distinctive attire . 
  you suggested it only mattered if they `` impose their beliefs ... beyond talking '' . 
  i 'm saying words got an old lady imprisoned because words and ideas do matter . 
  did n't that old lady who denied the holocaust and tried to spread those beliefs ** with words ** go to gaol ? 
  the transparency that wikileaks gave us showed that clinton and her court were the bigger fascistoids . 
  actually , that was hard work reading all that , it was n't easy to keep up , especially with the media shitshow . 
  it seems nothing is going to be pre-digested again into a trustworthy form , so i guess we need to put up with getting twatter from the horse 's mouth . 
  how can you complain about transparency ? 
  if there are effective and well resourced opposition parties bad news does n't get buried ( unlike in germany where everyone is in the trough in coalition ) . 
  thanks for the explanation , appreciate it . 
  old le pen was publicly kicked out and humiliated , yes ? 
  polarisation is a symptom . 
  and historically it has led to civil wars . 
  concepts such as left wing , right wing , communism , anarchism are from another time and can not describe the political movements we are witnessing . 
  what is the purpose of branding any anti-globalist or anti-technocrat as a right wing extremist ? 
  why do n't we hear the same of the opposite ? 
  who exactly is on the opposing team ? 
  who is the aristocracy and its lackeys this time round ? 
  when large groups of young white guys start getting celtic and nordic tattoos , wearing suits and adopting what they think is a roman salute ( as nazis also imagined ) and let is subsume their individuality it is no different to the hijab and beard wearing etc. 
  it 's tribal . 
  and as the left demanded everyone respect the provocative and sometimes aggressive tribalism coming from large numbers muslim migrants , the left can respect other ethnic groups doing it too . 
  it is no less offensive .
