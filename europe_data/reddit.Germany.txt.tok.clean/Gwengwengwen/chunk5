  yes , she did and she did it without consultation . 
  what i find amazing about this zeit article is the deliberate omission of this huge development in the month earlier . 
  contrast this german article with the [ uk 's independent on 24 august 2015 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylum-seekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-10470062.html ) : `` all current expulsion orders for syrian asylum-seekers will be revoked , the government said . 
  new syrian arrivals will no longer be forced to fill in questionnaires to determine which country they had first arrived in . 
  in the first six months of 2015 , germany registered 44,417 applications from syrian asylum-seekers . '', 
  and `` the german decision to declare open house for syrian refugees was welcomed by refugee support groups in britain as a lesson that the government should follow ... this announcement from germany is very significant . '', 
  really ? 
  why are we forgetting it now ? 
  history is being rewritten for the next election . 
  why do journalists do this shit ? 
  douglas murray is quite brilliant , an author and conservative commentator . 
  i 'm a big fan . 
  there 's a very interesting [ conversation ] ( https://youtu.be/yame1cnb9wi ) between him and sam harris on his waking up series of podcasts - 2 hours of it though . 
  gee , why was n't islam welcomed into the west in [ the past ] ( https://youtu.be/i_to-cv94bo ) ? 
  has islamic doctrine and its totalitarian supremacist ambitions changed ? 
  this is must be elsa from the russian version of frozen . 
  anna would have [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.com/putin-riding-bear-action-figure/dp/b00x61mve8 ) on her dress . 
  thanks . 
  that is a hideous crime . 
  idk , maybe because the dogs live in tiny flats under their owner 's nose 24/7 . 
  a lot of them are child substitutes too . 
  i 'd love to know how they get trained to be such well behaved dogs . 
  when do german dogs actually do it ? 
  i never see that even though i walk around with a pram everyday . 
  so not accurate ? 
  australia also has the solution to this , with water spray , learn the ways of [ craig . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/uibkljjlmv8 ), 
  that 's my memory of visiting paris , that it 's surrounded by garbage and there 's dog shit everywhere . 
  germany updated its law on rape to include verbal refusal as well as physical refusal as rape is violence in itself ... and probably published a nice pictogram to explain it . 
  more like ` there but for the grace of god go i ' . 
  no , that news story is hard to believe , the crime and court 's attitude . 
  like letting foreign fighters walk in and out of the country . 
  it 's like a whole civilisation has had this departure from reality . 
  the similarity is the incongruity between swedish culture and the extreme nature of the stories that keep popping up , it 's jarring . 
  is [ this report ] ( https://youtu.be/8qb0agh67ty ) of the gang rape of a paralysed women in a wheelchair accurate ? 
  that the suspects were allowed out of custody awaiting trial because they were n't violent ? 
  it 's a local crime story so that does n't get posted here regularly . 
  i hope you can post the topic here in the future when you come across a better report and layperson 's analysis , it would be an interesting discussion albeit taboo - and it 's probably bad timing to talk about it now while poland is debating anti-choice measures . 
  lol the mods agree, 
  sorry no-one is going to see your awesome comment because the topic was removed as `` off topic '' - i assumed fertility and depression were very europe relevant topics . 
  maybe you could repost it in the other threads discussing this article so it has n't been a waste of your time ? 
  changing hormones changes behaviour too . 
  imagine the change in the world if the under 50 male sex drive was slightly altered one way or the other . 
  i wonder if this danish research has found the missing link to explain europe 's below replacement fertility rates . 
  `` we 're reminded with one medical professional 's response to this new research that `` an unwanted pregnancy far outweighs all the other side effects that could occur from a contraceptive . '' i doubt that very much !, 
  if australia is successful at multiculturalism can you explain away the existence of the police specialist units called the asian crime squad and the middle eastern organised crime squad ? 
  or maybe that is why australia is more successful , not as many people denying the difficulties or tolerating the incompatible aspects of some cultures . 
  no , from a university based criminologist . 
  what alt-right facebook account are you referring to ? 
  ahead of what ? 
  why do you keep relying on these figures when we have enough indicators and leaks that they are n't a true reflection of what 's happening ? 
  why is it so important that this needs to be true ? 
  my point is laws are a cultural product and any society , eu or non eu , is different/foreign to the next . 
  compliance can not be assumed nor can the adoption of the same values . 
  of course it matters , it 's making romanians feel really bad for starters . 
  i can name a lot of countries who did not like the dutch owning their natural resources while letting them work the land and spiriting away the profits . 
  i thought the entire western world agreed this was a bad model ? 
  talk to the fairy . 
  german authorities have just released data showing a 25 % increase in thefts in german trains and train stations from 2014 to 2015 , from 35,800 to 44,800 cases . 
  even the 2014 number , 35,800 , represented a 20 % increase from 2013 . 
  the authorities blame foreign organized-crime gangs . 
  http://www.sueddeutsche.de/reise/ablenkungs-trick-tatort-bahnhof-1.3177886 [ as i said ... ] ( https://youtu.be/3nsq3mgsty4 ), 
  why are n't germany 's laws working as well as they did a few years ago ? 
  same laws , same effect surely . 
  trust harder or a fairy dies . 
  yes , strayan . 
  according to dutch giant rabobank , as it explains in [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/6rfxc6fhlx8 ) , farms are leased back to romanians and this is supposed to be some sort of win-win . 
  i do n't understand why that is a good thing at all . 
  especially after reading this report about farmers not even realising their land is [ no longer theirs . 
  ] ( https://euobserver.com/investigations/130989 ), 
  i 'm not german , so it seems strange to me . 
  it 's a matter of trust . 
  you are welcome to trust the free market and the forces of globalization and their outstanding record of ~ ~ externality ~ ~ environment stewardship . 
  my thinking is not dominated by the constant fear of nationalism and racism - that is a european cultural perspective . 
  i come from an island continent with no land borders . 
  foreign ownership is an important political issue where i come from , so my perspective is culturally different . 
  for example , it was a [ greens policy ] ( http://greens.org.au/land-ownership ) to track ownership of primary resources in australia - this was adopted and it was found about 80 per cent of mining was foreign owned and [ 13.6 per cent of farmland ] ( http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-06/uk-owns-biggest-proportion-of-foreign-owned-farmland/7820854 ) and [ 70 per cent of plantation forestry ] ( http://www.treasury.gov.au/~/media/treasury/consultations%20and%20reviews/consultations/2015/strengthening%20australias%20foreign%20investment%20framework/submissions/pdf/australian%20forest%20products%20association.ashx ) ( 20 per cent state owned ) . 
  this is similarly a priority political issue for new zealanders . 
  ownership , or rather control , of fisheries was a big issue in the brexit debate . 
  aside from the identity , environmental stewardship , employment and profit arguments , there is a longer range view about global population growth , finite resources and the effects of climate change . 
  thanks , i wanted to get some local insight and perspective . 
  i am irritated by the emotive and gender stereotyped reporting . 
  by the end of the story it 's all romantic racism and the heroism of law breaking : `` i made it this far by myself , with the kids , and i am going to go to germany , '' she said , determined . 
  `` i will manage to find a way . '' just like elsa from disney 's frozen - as already suggested by the author . 
  this reporting may work on americans , but i read that last bit as ( 1 ) why did your husband put you , your infant son and daughter in this dreadful position , ( 2 ) she has a few hundred euros , and ( 3 ) open contempt for the rule of law and an intention to break it in spite of being instructed directly by german police . 
  possible corruption . 
  [ bbc reported ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32792314 ) last year that illegal logging has inflicted losses of at least $ 5bn ( # 3.6 bn ; $ 5.7 bn ) on romania since the communist regime was toppled in 1989 and that romanians were protesting about it . 
  deforestation has reduced romania 's forest cover to about 26 % of the total land area , he said , `` but scientists say 36 % should be the minimum '' . 
  as to foreign ownership of forests or agricultural land , again it can be an identity issue as land is central to a group 's identity , it could be a national security issue re food security or simply exploitation of a poorer country 's primary resources . 
  it 's also possibly illegal in those countries . 
  and oak takes ages to grow , it 's a multigenerational investment . 
  i 'm guessing here , we need a romanian to tell us , but i 'd say it 's a german mistranslation of the romanian word for ` county ' with an in-text query that got missed before publication : `` gorj ( romanian pronunciation : [ \u0261or\u0292 ] ) is a [ county ( jude\u0163 ) ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorj_county ) of romania , in oltenia , with its capital city at t\u00e2rgu jiu . '',
