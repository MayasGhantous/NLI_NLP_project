  muslim missionaries now get the opportunity to tell the secular west what christianity is and that it follows the old testament as commands amongst other ridiculous things . 
  jesus christ did n't murder people or advocate violence , he healed people and spoke of love and forgiveness . 
  how about testimony from [ former muslims ] ( https://youtu.be/dr7_yq53lfi ) who understand what they 're talking about ? 
  saudi money does n't write islamic scripture which is littered with [ butchery and acts of terrorism ] ( https://youtu.be/ywmayxvuywk ) . 
  saudi money amplifies it and provides the means to organise . 
  islam itself and its fascism and agressive supremacism is still the problem . 
  [ beard up top and not on bottom ] ( https://youtu.be/uqd8tiodfhi ) . 
  i ca n't look at one of these guys now without laughing on the inside . 
  was i the last to know that muslim men get brazilians ? 
  same in australia but there is n't a history of anti-semitism there . 
  a 2014 report by the executive council of australian jewry showed physical attacks had increased 200 % since the previous year , threatening emails 180 % and property damage 66 % . 
  and there are similar problems to the uk labour party in the australian labor party . 
  bastards wo n't even give anglo saxon australians the right of return . 
  slaughter of innocents according to islam just means killing muslims without justification . 
  it does not include non believers , hypocrites and apostates in the definition of innocents . 
  i do n't know where you 're getting your info . 
  i found this explanation following the nice attack of [ the psycology of former drinking , drug taking , petty criminal jihadi ] ( https://youtu.be/k6epvxrldm0 ) useful . 
  as is this explanation for the [ orlando attack ] ( https://youtu.be/a13rj5yrahg ) . 
  where are the mainstream currents of islamic thought ? 
  i would like to read or watch some of that . 
  why do you say `` religiously ignorant '' ? 
  there are still living people from k\u00f6nigsberg , who were born there . 
  recipe : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/k\u00f6nigsberger_klopse, 
  apparently we 're not allowed to be concerned or do anything until terrorism deaths are greater than the road toll . 
  someone will tell us . 
  i think is a furphy , a lobbyist 's way of keeping out raw cane sugar imports competing with beet sugar . 
  i looked it up because germany has bad tasting sugar in comparison to australia 's . 
  `` in europe , sugar is manufactured from both sugar beet and sugar cane . 
  the two models have co-existed since the early 1800s . 
  a competing sweetener , isoglucose , manufactured from cereals , now also plays a role in the european sugar market . 
  sugar is a heavily regulated market in europe . 
  the operation of the eu sugar market is governed by europe 's common agricultural policy ( cap ) and trade policies . 
  for beet and isoglucose this sets limits , through quotas , that are policed by levies for exceeding them . 
  for cane sugar it sets very high import duties that can only be avoided by purchasing from a small proportion of the potential suppliers . 
  ** from 2017 , this situation will change . 
  europe 's beet and isoglucose sectors will no longer be constrained by quotas and will be allowed to produce as much sugar as they wish free of interference and cost from legislation . 
  in sharp contrast , europe 's cane sugar refining sector will continue to be restricted by imports duties and constraints on where it can source its raw material . 
  ** today cane refiners can only purchase sugar from around 5 % of that which freely trades globally . 
  this means that europe 's cane sugar refiners will be unable to compete on fair terms with the beet and isoglucose sector . 
  the basic import duty for cane sugar is $ 339 per tonne , which effectively doubles its cost and acts as an economic barrier to purchasing it . 
  the 5 % we are allowed to purchase free of this duty is made up of three categories . 
  firstly , cane sugar imports from developing countries with which the eu has a preferential trading relationship can be purchased free of duty . 
  these relationships are formalised under both the economic partnership agreements ( epas ) and the everything but arms agreements ( eba ) . 
  secondly , a small amount of cane sugar can be purchased free of duty from countries with which europe has a free trade agreement . 
  finally , the remaining cane sugar imports are largely sourced under the `` cxl '' quota . 
  this is a quota that exists as a result of trade negotiations with countries that previously supplied countries that have subsequently joined the eu . 
  most of this sugar is subject to a $ 98 per tonne import duty . 
  on a global basis , the situation is the reverse . 
  cane sugar currently accounts for around 17 % of the total sugar and isoglucose availability in europe . 
  beet sugar accounts for around 78 % and isoglucose around 5 % . 
  in the global sugar market the situation is the reverse , with cane sugar playing the lead role . 
  cane sugar accounts for around 80 % of total sugar production , with beet accounting for 20 % . '', 
  she wo n't change policy based on principle instead of results . 
  she lacks moderation , is uncompromising and dogmatic - the very definition of an ideologue . 
  she is black and white , she says this is right and that is wrong . 
  she is damaging germany and the eu in a material , demographic and cultural way . 
  merkel is an ideologue who is ignoring the consequences of her extremist policy . 
  when in a hole is it good to stop digging . 
  the analysis just demonstrates a lack of knowledge when it comes to how sensitive the people smuggling trade is to market signals . 
  the smallest policy tweaks are significant . 
  it was definitely an invitation of ignorant and epic proportions and i wo n't forget it for one fucking minute . 
  she needs to resign . 
  er , there are lots of actual dead french and german people as well as other europeans . 
  the deaths and injuries are real , hundreds of people are still in hospital or grieving , europeans do n't need to be ` told ' anything . 
  was n't that because abdeslam was on the run for months and the public at large needed to be able to identify him ? 
  is n't this how a manhunt needs to be supported ? 
  lots of witnesses come forward once a photo and name are released - sometimes victims of related crimes come forward too . 
  it does sound like a scene out of the movie [ four lions ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_lions ) . 
  it sounds like his thinking/mental state was many years in the making . 
  true , but his behaviour says he did n't belong or have the protection of a group , and his psychology suggests he felt so rejected that he avenged the injury to his ego by killing his peer group and wounding others . 
  i wonder whether the bullying came first and was then followed by the rationalisation for revenge and the loss of sanity . 
  he was set-up quite badly by fate : iranian/aryan , shared a birthday with hitler , born into a migrant fringe in germany , being a child of migrants . 
  i wonder if he was in some shit sandwich of alienation with indigenous german kids excluding him and turks and other sunni muslim kids bullying him [ like this ] ( https://youtu.be/_ljjojcddwe ) . 
  in some ways i am glad we heard quite a bit of this story from the killer himself through the balcony man shouting match otherwise it would be very hard to believe . 
  was the trigger his exam results and loss of an escape from his shitty situation ?? 
  edit : forgot link, 
  because mentally ill non-muslims are not following the example of mohammed and his manifesto for societal order . 
  [ like these guys ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2fnational-affairs%2fimmigration%2fasylum-selfharm-ends-after-family-travel-ban%2fnews-story%2f98df1c069cd66bd677d17639018b4661 ) it 's bullshit , it 's leverage to get your own way . 
  `` the number of asylum-seekers on nauru harming themselves plummeted to zero three months after immigration minister peter dutton stopped family members from being allowed to travel to australia to accompany a sick or injured person . '', 
  that study defines rare as a murder once per month . 
  if you trawl media reporting it 's at least double that now . 
  be nice if the data were available though . 
  the research that says honour based violence and killings are rare in germany is out-of-date - it covers 1996 to 2005 . 
  rare ? 
  like this [ turkish german guy ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/man-burns-pregnant-girlfriend-alive-because-he-did-not-want-to-be-father-germany-a6888806.html ) sentenced earlier this year for stabbing his heavily pregnant girlfriend and then burning her to death with his mate . 
  he and his mate only got 14 years for this and had their identities and backgrounds concealed from the public by privacy laws . 
  the axe attack does not count because it was n't against europeans ?? 
  in august 2015 , al-qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri released a statement supporting jihad in xinjiang against chinese . 
  any non-muslim will do , they do n't need to be europeans . 
  islam is fascist barbaric ideology , of course most muslims do n't believe in it or act on it . 
  thank goodness for that . 
  it does n't stop the sociopathic 1 % and it does n't stop a whole lot of shitty attitudes toward women and girls , homosexuality , freedom of speech , democracy ... anyway , you must know this . 
  [ seriously ? 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jemaah_islamiyah ) how about the fuckers trying to establish a regional islamic caliphate in southeast asia and australia , not europe . 
  [ this malaysian ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/zulkifli_abdhir ) was one of the most wanted terrorists in the world . 
  [ are you referring to this ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36804363 ), 
  that being the case i can think of over a million other people steinmeier should be more worried about who are right here in germany . 
  the only thing stopping us is the language barrier .
