another one i saw which was also pretty funny was `` wir denken immer einen schritt voraus '' ( `` we always plan one step ahead '' ) - which is n't funny in itself , but it was presented in such a way that the last few letters of `` ahead '' were tightly squashed into the lower right corner of the poster , because there was n't enough room for the whole slogan . 
  ( ca n't find the picture , unfortunately . ), 
  die partei is pretty great at unmasking hollow political slogans and phrases . 
  `` yes to europe - no to europe ! '', 
  might just be my favorite political campaign slogan in a long time . 
  i think it definitely has something to do with `` german angst '' , this nation has spent the last 70 years dealing with its past and the whole way germany works right now is designed to be the antithesis of the third reich ideology and agenda . 
  at this point , there is no direction but forward , we can not rely on `` old values '' like many other countries because of obvious reasons . 
  neither the third reich ( obviously ) nor the empire / weimar republic are really things to base modern german politics on ( edit : even though the weimar republic out of these is probably closest to modern day germany ) and every successful development in german national and international politics has been aimed towards some kind of progress to move away from our own past . 
   first of all - you editorialized the title . 
  that is not good reddiquette . 
  yes . 
  i see your point there , and again i apologize for offending your standards . 
  i can not change it back , though , so i will keep it . 
  my title was not a headline , it was a call-up . 
  and i have understood that that bothers you . 
  could we keep it at that ? 
   what makes your cause so much more worthy than everyone elses ? 
  what makes you the exeption to the rule ? 
  i do n't know , actually , probably nothing . 
  it 's just a topic that did n't get much exposure and i thought it would be worthy to share . 
  and judging by the reception of my post , other people seem to feel the same way . 
  my intention are not more noble than others and i have never said or implied that with anything i wrote , neither in my title nor in my contributions to this thread . 
  i shared a site and more people liked than disliked it . 
  that 's the way this site works - i did not upvote the post all by myself , you know . 
   ... `` privatization in europe through the eu ... ''  through the eu implies the eu , if you have n't understood that . 
  otherwise , you write southern europe , or more specific , portugal and greece , which i understand is the case . 
   this is another reason why you should n't write your own titles , obviously you did n't graps that `` in europe through the eu '' is read as exactly what it says , not as southern europe . 
  why did n't you just write that then ? 
  n\u00f3rthern europe is not a part of the eu perhaps ? 
  and again you happened to leave out the key word here , which is ** prevent ** , which means `` to keep something from happening '' , i.e. 
  before it has actually happened or in this case has taken full effect . 
  it does not mean that it is already happening throughout europe , but it is a growing trend in certain parts of europe , backed up by an eu wide agenda to support the privatization of water supplies , as you can read on the ec site i provided a link to . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're trying to prove a point about your perception of my `` lies '' here , but right now you are just putting words into my mouth / twisting around what i wrote - to make a point about me `` deceiving readers into thinking that the eu privatizes swedish water supplies at this moment '' ? 
  which is n't what i wrote and not what i wanted to imply . 
  again . 
   you implied that water was being privatisized in my country - sweden , either through my government or through the eu . 
  it is n't . 
  please , give me links for that is happening in sweden no . 
  i did n't imply that it * is * happening in sweden right now , at least that was n't my intention and i 'm not sure how you read that out of the title , however polemical it might be . 
  the word `` prevent '' just implies that there is a strong possibility of it happening in the future . 
  it is already practice in bailout countries to push water privatization to reduce national debt : http://www.neurope.eu/article/commission-favor-water-privatization-countries-receiving-bailout the ec `` encourages governments to open these services [ i.e. 
  water ] ( `` services of general economic interest '' or sgeis ) up to competition '' [ 1 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/opening_en.html ) [ here ] ( http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/reply%20to%20mrs%20zanzanaini.pdf%5b1%5d_0.pdf ) is a letter confirming that . 
  yes , it says corporate monopolies shall be prevented and it shall be consumer friendly etc. , but i and many other people are skeptical about that . 
  [ the report i was talking about earlier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq4ncp-inna ) , courtesy of the german news magazine `` monitor '' . 
  it is in german , but [ here ] ( http://www.right2water.eu/de/news/monitor-commission-plans-water-privatisation ) is an english transcript . 
  i know you will be skeptical seeing as the transcript is provided by right2water but i can assure you that it is correct and german speaking redditors can confirm that . 
  the portuguese community displayed in the report does n't benefit from the privatization efforts at all . 
  like i said : i 'm not saying that water is being privatized right now in your country , ** but ** it could be , if it goes according to the intentions of the ec . 
  and some people want to prevent that from happening , because if not regulated properly , water privatization can turn out pretty bad : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_cochabamba_protests to quote / u/embicek from this very thread :  in czech republic many of city water utilities were privatised during the early 90 's . 
  the main result are price increases every year , over thousand of percents over the time . 
  ** edit : ** again , i am ** not ** affiliated with right2water in any way , i just felt like it is a cause i want to support and share . 
  using this subreddit , because i was sure many people here would be interested as well . 
  i am sorry if my post did n't live up to the standards of this sub and i understand that it bothers you . 
  however , i do n't understand your claims that i am `` lying '' or `` self plugging '' . 
  i 'm not . 
  if the news behind the campaign turn out to be hot air , i 'm fine with that and i do n't feel like there 's harm done . 
  its not like i 'm promoting you to buy `` right2water '' t shirts or pushing some shady military agenda ( see kony ) . 
  if you do n't want to sign the petition , do n't sign the petition . 
  if it 's too sensational or unsubstantial for you , do n't sign the petition . 
  i just do n't understand why you have to start accusing me of `` lying '' - what would i have to lie about and with what intentions ? 
  i 'm not sure where i was '' * lying * '' , please elaborate . 
  first of all , it 's not * my * organisation . 
  i just support the cause and wanted to raise attention . 
  i know that it must look like a `` self plug '' but it is n't . 
  i got the link , looked up the campaign and thought that / r/europe might be a great tool to share it . 
  second , i 'm not saying that there * is n't * access to water in your country - we have access to water throughout europe and in most countries the water supply is still under communal control . 
  i have , however , seen a [ report ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq4ncp-inna ) ( in german , there seems to be a transcript on the right2water site though ) about the plans of the eu commission to open the markets . 
  i personally am against that , because many attempts in privatising water supplies from what i heard have turned out rather negative for the people : dramatically rising prices and often lower quality . 
  in the report they show a portuguese community that sold its water supply to a private company as a `` field test '' for the planned privatisation of the market in portugal . 
  from what the community says , the water prices have risen over 400 % in the last few years , while the quality has declined . 
  in my opinion , something as vital as water should n't be subject to the free market , i 'm very very sceptical about the possible consequences ( like the example written above ) . 
  at least , quality and prices should be under strict regulations . 
  that 's why i wrote `` prevent '' - it 's a preemptive measure against plans that are seemingly in motion inside the eu . 
  from this thread , however , that there are many people who see that differently , especially from the uk . 
  i 'm glad that a discussion has been started and yes , if you do n't support the cause , do n't sign the petition . 
  the headline * is * sensationalistic . 
  absolutely . 
  i 'm aware of that - i was , however , simply adapting the rhetoric of the campaign , mainly because i think it might get people interested in looking into the site and not just browsing over it - like you did , for example , so thanks for that . 
  fair enough . 
  still , thank you for not just ignoring the link . 
  a lot of people are talking about that , actually . 
  but good luck telling that to some syrian father who wants to get his kids out of a warzone . 
  `` hey amir , why dont you and your family just stay over there . 
  you know , try to make your country a better place . '', 
  there are already a lot of people who are trying to do that and the result is a civil war that has been going on for almost five years now . 
  trouble , yes . 
  change is never easy and the clash of different cultures will undoubtedly lead to some tensions in german society , it 's already happening . 
  but again : that 's nothing new . 
  youre acting like the world is going to end because of isis and mass immigration ? 
  a little more than 50 years ago we were on the brink of full out nuclear war . 
  a little more than 70 years ago germany was a fascist dictatorship that gassed people in concentration camps , while the whole fucking world was at war with each other - and even the good guys in that war treated a big part of their own population like subhumans and wiped out two cities with nuclear bombs . 
  and you think we ' re living in the end times * now * ? 
  wasnt sure what you were getting at with your comment . 
  wait . 
  so if all those people come to the place that isnt fucked to escape the places that are , why the hell would they want to make their own life in europe worse than it could be ? 
  its not going to get worse , society isnt going to collapse , it 's just going to change . 
  look at german society now , which you apparently seem to like a lot , at least in comparison to other countries . 
  today , nobody would consider it strange or not normal to meet somebody called mehmet or cenk in germany . 
  or luca , mario , giuseppe , whatever . 
  hell , half of the family names in the ruhr area these days end in '' - ski '' .
