so , your 40 % is `` just a gut feeling '' ... 
  but since you seem to understand `` basic arithmetic '' lets get to actual numbers ( https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/_querschnitt/fluechtlinge/fluechtlinge.html ) : 2015 and 2016 saw a total of 978.459 asylum seekers in germany . 
  of those , 804.631 were either granted asylum or their status is not yet decided ( i 'm counting them , even if not all of them will be granted asylum in the end ) . 
  of those , 18-25 years is the largest group ( 21 % ) , followed by 0-4 years ( 20 % ) . 
  now , let 's widen the age group : 16-30 years - this age group makes up 40 % , this equals 321.846 people . 
  of those , about 28 % are female , this equals 90.117 people . 
  now , let 's assume that none of those women already has kids , that fall into the 0-4 years demographic mentioned above and instead every single woman stays in germany for the rest of her life and has 2,55 children ( current total fertility rate of syrians taken as example : https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html ) , that would equal 229.798 children throughout their lifespan . 
  now lets add those numbers up : 229.798 children + 273.568 children already there ( aged 0-16 ) are 503.366 people . 
  now the shocking realization : 503.366 are less than 804.631 . 
  so , the refugee `` population '' is actually shrinking in absolute terms . 
  second generation immigrants usually do n't have higher fertility rates than their host country , so that number wont rise significantly . 
  this example is n't saying anything about the fertility of `` native '' germans , so it is possible that the 11 % are somewhat realistic if the german population has a much lower fertility rate , but that 's hardly the fault of the refugees . 
  your procentual values implicate that refugees are somehow `` multiplying exponentially '' , which they are n't . 
  there are multiple wrong assumptions in your thoughts : - refugees do n't die ( they do ) - fertillity rates are highest in the demographic of below 24 year olds ( they are n't ) - refugees never leave germany ( they do ) - refugee demographics are homogenous ( they are n't ) - population groth rates are stable ( they are n't ) - fertillity rates dont change ( they do ) - refugee children can never become german citizens ( they can ), 
  i opt for choice 5. : we let ourselves get saved by the lizard people from the hollow earth . 
  seriously , its exactly the same kind of nonsense-doomsday scenarios that were spread in the 90 's , when the balkan refugees came to germany . 
  also i strongly disagree with the `` empty tank of our economic engine '' . 
  the real problem in germany is the housing bubble . 
  if that one bursts , we will be in real trouble - not because of refugees . 
  so , taking someones child away because the mother is underage is an acceptable thing ? 
  really ? 
  you know that there are plenty of non-muslim teenage mums in european countries ? 
  maybe because that 's actually the truth ? 
  let 's not forget this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lms9vcvnr5a :p, 
  the afd is certainly not for any sort of migration if you would bother to check a couple of statements from some of their prominent politicians . 
  aeu ( http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/advanced_european_union ), 
  maybe trump himself leaked that document intentionally , because its the only year in which he actually paid taxes ? 
  `` singapore tops the city infrastructure ranking , followed by frankfurt and munich both in 2nd place '' ... the actual fuck !, 
  i have made a round trip in japan last year , with visits to osaka , kyoto and hiroshima and each of those cities absolutely trashes the public transportation systems of munich and frankfurt !, 
  i was able to get literally everywhere without even understanding the language !, 
  in munich the trouble already begins when trying to decide which ticket you need for a specific trip ( and that is when you do understand the language ... ), 
  ... and in the end , the germans always win  gosh guys , that was a joke . 
  should have added the / s. . . 
  the question is rather : is it a problem for you if criminal and illegal activities are investigated ? 
  and paying her own bodyguards with taxpayers money ? 
  ah yes . 
  do n't prosecute politicians that are corrupt and criminal . 
  north korean style . 
  they do n't call it the democratic peoples republic for nothing . 
  ftfy, 
  well , he was the one stating it is not equally enforced . 
  so he should have examples where french ppl did the same thing without being prosecuted . 
  actually i think not even triggering art . 
  50 will change much . 
  the big boom will come when ( if ) gb loses access to the single market . 
  imagine only one person being eligible to vote : you could end up with 100 % voting for brexit . 
  / s thats why [ quorums ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quorum ) have been invented . 
  if you can not get 70 % of citizens to vote , then the status quo remains . 
  yeah , but their campaigns are n't based on lies and propaganda . 
  thats the difference . 
  if people vote to crucify u/zh1k476tt9pq , would you also say that is is undemocratic not to respect the vote of the majority ? 
  democracy does not just mean that people can vote , it also means that minorities are protected from the power of the majority . 
  people seem to ferget this whenever it is convenient . 
  the eu is made up of exactly those countries . 
  people vote for their governments . 
  if they would feel this would be a big issue , then you would have had parties agitating against it to get more votes in the next election . 
  and yes , the uk is `` to blame '' for brexit . 
  i do n't even know how you can possibly put `` blame '' on anyone else than the people literally * voting for it *, 
  you should check out how referendums are held in switzerland . 
  each citizen gets a book ( ! ), 
  with neutral information about to pros - and cons of the referendum , including parliamential debates and informations based on actual facts ( that all parties have agreed upon ) . 
  with this kind of voting the brexit referendum with all its lies and smear campaigns would have tourned out different . 
  article is unfortunately only available in german : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/abstimmungsb%c3%bcchlein, 
  i think culture refers to much broader expenditures , such as theatre and and festivals that dont have any relation to religion, 
  by beeing a dictatorship ? 
  that doese n't work anymore for countries , where refugees are expected . 
  and the visa procedure got cut anyway : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/europaeischer-gerichtshof-fluechtlinge-haben-kein-anrecht-auf-humanitaere-visa-a-1137622.html ( sorry , but i rarely have non-german sources for this ), 
  i think you have n't understood that program at all . 
  that is n't allowed . 
  you can only apply for asylum when you are ** inside ** germany . 
  and you 've never tried to run for your life from torture prisons and guys , that want to cut your head off . 
  lol yeah , thats a success story , how many syrians have been resettled ? 
  http://rsq.unhcr.org/#nzg3 2016 syrian arab rep. ( syr ) turkey ( tur ) germany ( deu ) 2,146 lol it 's especially noteworthy that there are n't many countries beside germany that even participate in this program . 
  guess what , they are where the majority of people were drowning . 
  guess a lifeguard is also a human trafficker ... 
  have you ever been 30km away from the coast on a small rubber boat with amalfunctioning outbord engine ? 
  tunisia has closed its ports . 
  they are bringing them to the nearest bigger ship , usually from the maritime authority ( cost guard/navy ) . 
  you need to be * inside * a country if you want to apply for asylum . 
  it 's not possible to do so `` across the border '' . 
   when rescuing at sea it 's your responsibility to take them to the nearest port . 
  to the nearest * safe * port . 
  lybia is a war torn country where people vanish in torture prisons . 
   that this makes matters worse in the mediterranean by increasing the number of people who will try this in the future the number of people who try this is [ decreasing ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/italien-zahl-der-bootsfluechtlinge-geht-zurueck-a-1141263.html ) , but do n't let facts get in your way . 
  rescue ships are looking for people to be rescued , how dare they !, 
   the migrants wait until the ngo ships are close before claiming to be in distress . 
  do you have any sort of credible source for that ? 
  because usuelly they are on inflatable boats without any sort of communication device . 
  tunisia has closed all its ports . 
  yeah , because if you are in distress in the yellow sea , you would also want to get picked up and brought to the nearest safe harbour . 
  this is not a loophole , but common sense . 
  can you give an example of a `` legal '' way for a real refugee to enter the eu ? 
  no they wo n't because the smugglers still tell them the story , wich they believe . 
   since the ngo 's have started picking up migrants they have been going closer and closer to the african shore . 
  source ? 
  they are more than 30km away from the shore , thats a point where you can not even see land anymore, 
  wich loophole ? 
  i know that . 
  but asking 100 convicted criminals how much of them have committed crimes gaves you , well , 100 % , no ? 
   so watching cp also gets you on this list ?
