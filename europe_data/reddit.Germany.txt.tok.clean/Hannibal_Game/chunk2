  yes , it 's \u00a7 184b stgb and a gazillion other relevant \u00a7 's for trafficking , watchin , creating , etc. 
  i 'll let you do the math , 
   there are 21.320 algerians in germany , so does that mean there have been 138 algerien suspcts accused of almost : 148 according to the official table . 
  this includes * all kinds * of sexual crimes , from exhibitionism , child porn , rape and even groping . 
  they listed the amounts of cases , not suspects . 
  a single suspect can be responsible for multiple cases and a single case can have multiple suspects . 
  thats why this statistic is difficult to interpret . 
  the stats are from here : https://www.bka.de/de/aktuelleinformationen/statistikenlagebilder/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/pks2016/standardtabellen/standardtabellentatverdaechtige.html?nn=65720 table 62 . 
  now , a couple of questions/remarks : 1 . ), 
  it is not per 100.000 citizens , but per 100.000 * members of that group * 2 . ), 
  it shows only accusations and does not tell anything about wether those cases were legitimate or false . 
  what does nafri mean ? 
  its not in the table . 
  where do the numbers for asylbewerber come from ? 
  they are not in the table either . 
  `` straftaten gegen die sexuelle selbstbestimmung '' includes * everything * from child porn , rape to touching and even `` exhibitionism '' . 
  the site from bka explicitly mentions to be careful with comparisons , because to compare the groups they need to be homogenous . 
  the german populance is generally older than your typical syrian refugee . 
  usa has a lot of soldiers stationed in germany . 
  some groups are so small that a single crime case pushes them way beyond the median . 
  old people are usually less often involved in sexual crimes . 
  it would have been interesting to have actual comparable groups . 
  so , if there really was a `` mob of 1000 immigrants '' , how come nobody has * any * videos or pictures of it ? 
  usually this gets filmed and is all over the web the next day . 
  why do all the people living in that little town tell a totally different story ? 
  and last , why should we trust the words of right wing propaganda websites that this is a `` second cologne '' , that have already lied about multiple cases ( case lisa , case paul , etc. ), 
  in the past more , than the police chief ? 
  questions i 'm sure you have the answer ... 
  because they are quoting the police chief ? 
  because they are interviewing girls , who were at the festival ? 
  i 'm quite sure they can explain to me how in a town that houses less than 700 asylum seekers there can be crowd of 1000 . 
  maybe because this was a town festival with many germans ? 
  maybe because the guy who threw the bottle and got arrested for it was a german ? 
  maybe because the guys that attacked the police were also german ( happens every year in that town ) ? 
  except that 's not what the article says . 
  the * suspects * are 17 % asylum seekers ( and that value was 32 % in 2006 ) . 
  also , 77,8 % of the cases are committed in the family . 
  this is plain wrong . 
  the country of origin is stated in the official police report of germany every year . 
  https://www.vice.com/de/article/3kn4z5/die-wahrheit-uber-den-einwanderermob-von-schorndorf here are your first hand reports btw . 
  https://www.vice.com/de/article/3kn4z5/die-wahrheit-uber-den-einwanderermob-von-schorndorf yea , except for the people who actually were in schorndorf tell a totally different story . 
  they bottle-throwing guys were arrested btw and - surprise - he is a german . 
  but they do . 
  in 2009 they promised to reduce taxes . 
  and they did . 
  ^ for ^ hotel ^ owners . 
   the bamf gave refugee status to that bundeswehr soldier who did n't even speak arabic . 
  but he spoke french and had helpers at the public authority  amri , the terrorist from berlin was registered with 6 identities at the bamf . 
  ... which they found out before he committed the attack . 
  it 's not that easy to trick them . 
  also , if you are right , that means it 's even less than the numbers say ... 
  males ? 
  poor ? 
  uneducated ? 
  yeah , groups that have the `` wrong '' skin colour ... 
  well , i for one , am glad that we are no `` rich arab country '' . 
  but agreed on the stabilization of conflict zones . 
  they are included in those numbers as `` not accepted '' ( because they can not claim for asylum under german law ) . 
  http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/flyer/flyer-schluesselzahlen-asyl-2016.pdf;jsessionid=75a85d9b907bd31e999397a641a6362b.2_cid368?__blob=publicationfile here 's your ridiculously small number for 2016 : * 695.733 decisions * 256.136 accepted as refugees ( 36,8 % ) * 153.700 accepted as subsidiary protected groups ( 22,1 % ) * 173.846 not accepted ( 25 % ) * 24.084 temporary deportation ban ( 3,5 % ) * 87.967 withdrawn because of relocation etc. 
   yes i have read what he has written thank you . 
  please go back and read what i have written . 
  yes i have read what you have written thank you . 
  please go back and read what he has written . 
   as an absolute last resort , yes . 
  yeah , sure , let 's go to war because someone has doubts about the citizenship of people you are claiming are his . 
  this has nothing to do with international law btw . 
  what would you do if the donald sends a boat full of `` illegal immigrants '' to germany and says `` take back your citizens !, 
  i ca n't prove they are yours , but here they are ! '', 
  and forces you to accept them by sending a few destroyers and ssbns to underline his statement ? 
  immigrants ! = refugees, 
  because you seem to be pretty well informed - do you have the current numbers for that claim ? 
   then it is the issue . 
  have you even read what he has written ? 
   need to force them to play ball by doing what ? 
  declaring war on them ? 
  in that case the sentences need to be higher . 
  to me a modern justice system ideally gives out the same punishments/sentences to a convict for the same crime , regardless of their country of origin . 
  everything else strongly feels like `` the only ones allowed to do crimes in our country is our natives !, 
   on the basis of his hundreds of interactions with these young men in his professional capacity over the past several years , he believes to have discovered that they are motivated by a deep and abiding contempt for western civilization . 
  well yeah , criminals are criminal ... thats like asking a bunch of neonazis about their `` contempt for western civilization '' . 
  would have been more interesting to hear what majority of law abiding immigrants has to say about this . 
  the court translator himself for example obviously does not share this worldview . 
   once you have set foot in europe , it will be almost impossible to get rid of you ; indeed , you can literally commit murder . 
  how many refugees have actually comitted cases of murder ? 
   if a court finds you guilty of rape , you need only argue that if you are sent home , your conservative society will kill you for the dishonorable act -- then you ca n't be shipped out , because eu law forbids extradition if doing so puts the individual 's life at risk . 
  if a court finds you guilty of that , you need to be put into a fucking prison , instead of being `` sent home '' . 
  the definition of hate speech is exactly that in germany - threatening people , insulting people , calls for violence . 
  for example jan b\u00f6hmermann calling erdogan `` ziegenficker '' ( goat fucker ) is not considered hate speech by this definition . 
  threatening a person with `` we know where you live , better watch out for not getting a knife between your ribs when you go out next time '' is a threat and considered hate speech . 
  [ source ] ( https://twitter.com/bka/status/877076563279446016 ), 
   family reunion for example : if you are a german citizen or ordinary immigrant those are the rules , but if you are a refugee you can bring in your family without having to have a job and them speaking german and so on . 
  there is a very long explanation of how it works [ here ] ( http://www.anwalt.org/asylrecht-migrationsrecht/familienzusammenfuehrung/ ) . 
  if you have been granted * unlimited * asylum , you are allowed to get your spouse and your children to germany ( or your parents , if you are under 18 ) if you request it within 3 months after your asylum has been granted . 
  otherwise the rules apply . 
  that is why the number of people getting to germany through this system is so low . 
   pocket money : total cost per asylum seeker in germany is 670 euros . 
  this is the minimum income needed to exist according to our constitutional court . 
  that sum includes * everything * from the accommodation costs to clothes to personal hygiene products and food . 
  those costs are not paid out to the asylum seekers , they get deducted as noncash benefit in the form of clothes etc. 
  usually the `` cash '' pocket money is between 76 and 135 euros depending on age and federal state .
