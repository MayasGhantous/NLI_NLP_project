   social grants : guess you mean medical benefits here ? 
  only the most basic needs are covered in the most essential way . 
   free housing : see above  family reunion : this is * extremely * difficult . 
  you need : * to be 18 years old * prove that you have a job that can sustain you and your family ( ! ), 
  * an unlimited residence permit or subsidiary protection * proof , that your partner speaks german on level a1 ( there are a few hardship cases where this is excluded ) just to put this in perspective : 2016 saw 3.200 persons migrating to germany through the family reunion system . 
   granting citizenship and this is * really * difficult , unless you were a victim of nazi persecution . 
  because i do not want to copy-paste all the points that you need to qualify for a naturalizatin , here 's the link : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nationality_law ( see passage about naturalization ), 
  do you know how widespread this is ? 
  human traffickers are telling them lies about that anyway . 
  the social benefits are already low , citizenships and family reunions ( at least in germany ) are extremely hard to get . 
  lowering them further would just increase an `` us vs them '' mentality . 
  and if you treat them like scum , you do n't have to wonder if they behave like scum . 
  it worked in georgia ... and it 's not * that * hard to fabricate civil unrest . 
  if the russians ever decide to do that , the first thing they will drop is n't bombs , but russian passports , and the first things that will roll across the border will be humanitarian aid convoys , not tanks . 
  theres a multitude of systems available : for medium ranges : * not entirely european , but patriot is supposed to be replaced by [ meads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medium_extended_air_defense_system ) ( us , germany , italy ) for short ranges : * [ iris-t slm ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/iris-t_slm ) ( germany ) * [ rbs-23 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rbs_23 ) ( sweden ) * [ camm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camm_ ( missile_family ) ) ( uk ) but nothing comparable to thaad afaik, 
  what has the skin colour to do with islam ? 
  you know , you can chose your religion , but ... 
  i do n't think that this was an accident . 
  after so many years in power , she doese n't make such mistakes . 
  and it works : look at the popularity of the cdu - they are close to an absolute majority . 
   if you do and be things like that you 're more german than any achmed born from mohammed who immigrated recently who demands tolerance for your muslim culture . 
  sure , i am the one antagonizing here ... 
   unlike almost everyone flooding in currently demanding welfare and asylum . 
  you know that they are demanding because you have actually spoken with all of them ? 
  maybe you should stop examining broad things using individual cases ? 
  even the syrian children that my mother is teaching in school already speak german well enough to do written examinations and get results that are comparable to german children btw . 
   you can buy cheap traditional clothing of any country and not look the part . . but it 's different when it 's a local wearing stuff either their grandparents passed down or they made themselves with care . 
  that 's how you `` integrate '' ? 
  by having grandparents pass on traditional clothing to you ? 
  how many germans actually are integrated then ? 
  besause `` non-whites '' ca n't be christian and democratic ? 
  thats a very christian and democratic thing to say ... 
   wear a lederhosen yeah . 
  buy pair of cheap lederhosen , go to a rural area `` volksfest '' and get laughed on for being a foreigner . 
   to be german is to be uptight , efficient , organized , less flexible , streamlined , standardized , meticulous it 's kinda funny to have that image in other countries , even if it is just an image . 
   drink tons of beer okay , have to agree with that , but franconia and bavaria seem to be special in that regard ...  if you do and be things like that you 're more german than any achmed born from mohammed who immigrated recently who demands tolerance for your muslim culture . 
  the refugee woman that is living below my apartment is greeting me in german every time i see her . 
  she 's never `` demanded '' anything ... maybe you should look beyond your generalization . 
   the fact that the military is not used for situations which actually need force ( such as enforcing the schengen border ) does n't really help their reputation . 
  the military is trained and intended to do combat with armed adversaries , not for silly border patrols checking passports of unarmed civillians . 
  we have a federal police for that . 
    but this means the system itself is compromised . 
  considering that thing is rather heavily controlled and that 's open source i 'm not sure we have to worry that much about all the systems being compromised . 
  the open source is nice to have , but you ca n't check , if the software on the voting machine is the same . 
  its easy to fake checksums and the like . 
  the `` heavy controlled '' is the key thing here , but it doese n't exclude the possibillity to manipulation , especially if the controllers themselves are the ones manipulating . 
   your example is target that your voting ballot gets swapped out on paper . 
  which is n't possible without re-printing the ballots and engaging guys to do exactly that on a large scale . 
   also , with e-voting you later get confirmation on another device that tells you your vote if you so choose . 
  that is meaningless , because it can show you whatever you chose and count something else . 
  it remains a black box , contrary to a paper ballot . 
   if you can go and cast a paper ballot , which will bee taken into account instead of your e-vote . 
  fair enough if it stays like that . 
  i 'm not making this up btw , such manipulations have already happened : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wahlf%c3%a4lschungsskandal_von_dachau ( only available in german ), 
  why would you tamper with them , if not to manipulate the counting ? 
  consider this scenario : there are 3 partys a , b and c that people can vote on . 
  the voting machine is rigged to count every second b-vote and every second c-vote for a instead . 
  you want to vote for b , press the button for b and the machine shows you `` congratulations !, 
  you have successfully casted your vote for b ! '', 
  how can you be sure , that your vote is actually counted for b ? 
  if this was an classic vote , where you have to make your mark on the party showing b , then you could easily request a recount if you suspect fraud . 
  with voting machines that is not possible . 
  you can always recount paper votes if you suspect fraud , but you can never be sure what you actually `` recount '' when recounting e-votes ... 
   the amount from both the uk and eu for none is quite baffling while it is a lot , keep in mind that 17 % is n't * that * much overall . 
  as the sum of the percentages is 100 i guess multiple answers were n't possible . 
  and yeah , remembering the war stories from my grandma , peace is also what i would stick to if i had to chose . 
  i heard the rebels have some of [ those ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buk_missile_system ), 
  there 's an interesting report i read a while ago : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bwssglkg0lm2avhrnxexq2fvtngxbzhwyvfcsfpvnwncdvfb/view it 's long , but really worth the read . 
  they explain , how military tactics and strategies from both sides evolved in the ukrainian war . 
  - proliferation of small and medium spotter drones - gps jammers - usefulness of top-attack ammunition - uselessness of apcs - comeback of [ sturmgesch\u00fctze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2s1_gvozdika ) ... 
  upvote , because that 's the shortest , most accurate description of two constitutions and the 2 +4 agreement that i 've read . 
  maybe he forgot to use his sunscreen ? 
  [ because `` real germans '' do n't do terrorism ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground ), 
  it was a single guy and the gun was a police gun that he somehow managed to steal from one of the officers during a brawl . 
  . . and not , let 's say , the usa ? 
  [ oh wait ... ] ( http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/ ), 
  do we have some covers from todays newspapers ? 
  would be interested what they look like ... 
   as long as they are , no ** overt ** invasion is gon na happen . 
  [ suspicously specific denial ... ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/suspiciouslyspecificdenial ) , 
  the campaign in georgia was - from an observer standpoint - masterfully executed , thats one of the reasons people get a little bit itchy nowadays ... 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/state_word_map_2x.png ), 
  i love the subtlety on that one !, 
  i can only imagine his aides trying to explain to him all these little nuances in official communication ( with crayon sketches and all ... ), 
  i have n't said that we should abandon law enforcement and permit violence ... of course criminals need to be prosecuted and jailed . 
  people are fleeing from syria exactly for the reason you stated . 
  but even if you are careful you ca n't provide 100 % security from terror attacks . 
  if it is n't a migrant doing the next one , then it 's others ( see brevik in norway or aum-shinrikyo in japan ) . 
   they accept the vietnamese because they proved themselves to be hard workers . 
  well , another redditor commented to me that just because they have jobs , they do n't necissarily share the same values . 
  i currently live in the same urban districs as the local asylum seekers , and have n't seen any social friction besides `` but their kids are playing too loud ! '', 
  and of course language barriers . 
  i do acknowledge that there are problematic urban districts in other cities , but simply ca n't accept that it 's a common phenomenon . 
   on the other hand , the `` let no one ever come here '' attitude is very rare . 
  i think that even skinhead gangs mostly disbanded themselves . 
  well , i do n't know about czechia , but in germany that 's a case of information bias . 
  you rarely read about it anywhere but in the local news , but extreme-right crimes are on a steep rise . 
  for example at the same time a [ migrant-looking guy kicked a woman down the escalator at a berlin subway station ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2017-04/berlin-neukoelln-u-bahn-treppe-sturz-anklage ) a neonazi kicked a guy * on the subway railroad in front of a train * because he thought [ `` it was a jew '' ] ( http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/26716 ) . 
  yet only one of the two got the attention of the entirety of even this subreddit .
