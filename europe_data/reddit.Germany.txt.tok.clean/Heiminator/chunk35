  let me explain the difference between siemens managers behaviour and greek politicians behaviour : the siemens guys break the law and circumvent regulations for the profit of their company , which , as siemens is one of germanys most important companies , is for the benefit of the country as a whole . 
  so while this behaviour is immoral , it does n't hurt the german nation and is thus not a problem for the german people . 
  meanwhile the people at the greek end of the deal rob their own country of taxpayer money so they can buy german fancy technology that their country does n't really need ( hightech submarines come to mind , their biggest `` enemy '' turkey is a fellow nato member ) while banking some bribe money in the meantime . 
  they act against their own nations best interest to enrich themselves , while the siemens guys act in their own nations best interest . 
  both break the law , only one is immoral enough to hurt their own team in the process, 
   your country essentially threatened the greek people that if they did n't vote for new democracy in the elections , all hell woul break loose bullshit , the situation was that tsipras and his communists announced that if they were to win the election , they 'd be happy to keep receiving eu money but would stop obeying the already negotiated austerity measures . 
  so the rest of europe , lead by germany , made it clear that greece would only keep receiving money if they stuck to the plan they had agreed upon . 
  we have better things to do with our money than to throw it down a bottomless barrel . 
  we did n't threaten you , we just told you what consequences your actions may have and our politicians have to justify their actions to german voters as well . 
  no one votes for politicians that simply give our money to greece without also forcing them to give some guarantees and agree to some measures that make it realistic that we will ever see our money again . 
  and deregulation of our own labour market and cuts to our social system a decade ago ( look up the hartz reforms ) was what enabled us to survive the euro and financial crisis as well as we did . 
  all the cuts the greeks are whining about right now are so harsh because they did n't make them a decade ago ( which is where greek voters become responsible , they preferred voting for parties that kept up the illusion and did n't force some tough cuts on them ) , and now they have to be brutal to save the ship from sinking greek society has some fundamental problems , corruption and tax evasion among them , that the greek society needs to adress if it wants to prosper again . 
  i have been on holiday in greece 4 times in my life , and every single time i had to pay `` fakelaki '' in one way or another , be it for a doctor , a car mechanic or the guy at the airport responsible for rebooking my flight . 
  in my 28 years living in germany i yet have to bribe a single person for anything, 
  i said this before in this thread : collecting money from the rich parts of greek society is a greek problem , not a german one . 
  if you feel that the elite of your country is robbing the working class feel free to vote accordingly during the next election . 
  but my point stands , on average the greek population has consumed more than it produced for a long time , the fact that some uber-rich people tipped the scale more than the average working class citizen is true , but does n't change the overall situation of the country and is surely not my problem over here in germany . 
  start collecting taxes from ship-owners and big industrials would be my tip for a start, 
  so because greek politicians , elected by the majority of greek voters , engage in shady deals with foreign companies that is somehow our german problem ? 
  if the greeks disagree with the way their elected leaders run the country they can feel free to vote for someone else during the next election . 
  and collecting money from the richer parts of greek society is a greek problem , not a german one tl ; dnr : nobody forced greece to buy all these fancy german submarines , so greek people can stop whining about how these deals crippled their economy ( or better : take the whining up to their former leaders that agreed to these deals as representatives of the greek people ), 
  well it is n't living beyond your means if you control the colony that provides the ressources for your own wealth back home . 
  it might be ethically questionable to exploit a colony , but it still provides the means for a higher standard of living . 
  greeces problem is that they try to run a first world welfare state without having first world productivity . 
  note that i am not calling them lazy , i do n't doubt that the average greek works as many hours as the average german , but the german creates more value in the same time . 
  if greece would go down to the standard of living of neighbours like romania and bulgaria they would n't have any problems and to answer your question : i do n't wish for greece to burn in economic hell , but they must be held accountable for decades of economic mismanagement . 
  so i support further bailouts and financial assistance , but only as long as greece plays ball and agrees to close supervision . 
  we are willing to help , but we wo n't just throw money at greece without them agreeing to strict rules . 
  and i am aware that most greeks suffer from these measures , while a small percentage of greeks gets even richer , but collecting money from the rich parts of greek society is a greek problem , not a german one, 
  they may be sons of bitches , but they are our sons of bitches, 
  over here in germany its almost proverbial by now : the greeks do n't need german money , they need german tax collectors, 
  greece is paying the bill for living well beyond its means for decades . 
  the fact that the international markets gangrape them is just a symptome of their economic condition , not the underlying problem, 
  you wan na know why the french women welcomed their american liberators ? 
  because they could finally sleep with a real winner that did n't call them fr\u00e4ulein, 
  the second half of your post is fascist bullshit , but the first point is actually true , germany has more immigrants per capita than greece for example , and yet greece keeps complaining that they are the only ones who have to deal with immigration issues edit : am i being downvoted for calling txampions first statement fascist bullshit or for stating the simple truth that germany has more immigrants per capita than greece ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/immigration_to_europe#statistic_data_on_immigrant_populations ) ? 
  do you really believe that people in the balkan countries are nowadays worse off then they were 25 years ago , or at any other point in human history for that matter ? 
  i seriously ca n't believe that people like you actually think nato intervened so that philip morris could buy a serbian tobacco plant on the cheap , instead of trying to stop genocide committed by serbian troops, 
  norrsken is correct with his translation , the subtext in german sounds more like `` not whilst i 'm still breathing '' than `` not in my lifetime '', 
  no english version of the article yet , but spiegel online usually publishes the international version a few hours after the german version , i 'll post it here once it is online edit : thanks to malcomtucker for the bloomberg verification , here is the [ link ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-25/merkel-rejects-joint-euro-bonds-bills-with-all-eyes-on-germany.html ), 
  lies !, 
  fair point , we misunderstood each other then :-) ( sorry , as a german we tend to get defensive around here with all the bullshit being spilled around ), 
   most of the money germany also gives to other countries for help do come back to the country anyway we 'd have to be full-on retarded to do it differently , and i still do n't see how that simple fact makes us responsible for greeces inability to manage their own economy . 
  and this is not a european problem , its a distinctively southern european problem , i do n't see eastern europe , finland , the netherlands , austria , belgium etc complain , it is only the economies of southern europe that are unable to keep up ( ireland being the exception to the rule , but they are doing a much better job at getting back on track than the greeks ) and hell will freeze over before the majority of german voters agrees to a permanent transfer union, 
  its a [ real movie ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/ ) , and its as awesome as the trailer makes it looks like :-), 
  incorrect , the first germans went to space in gigantic nazi ufos , have n't you seen the [ documentary ] ( http://www.ironsky.net/ ), 
  yeah its hard to keep poll results to get out in the modern information age . 
  you could see this during the french presidential elections , the french media was forbidden to release poll results , but nothing stopped the belgian newspapers ( many of them being published in french ) from releasing them on their websites/twitter etc during election day , made even worse by the fact that france has overseas territories that get to vote earlier and thus can provide highly accurate estimates around here in germany we practice election silence on an honor code system , there is no law to enforce it , but it is considered extremely bad style for a politician to actively campaign in the last 48 hours before the voting starts , that includes `` supporting fire '' by other high ranking politicians belonging to the candidates parties and you are of course correct in questioning the trustworthyness of private pollers, 
  because polls influence voter behaviour . 
  if you think that your party has no chance ( or even a clear lead ) one day before the election you might become lazy and decide to stay home the next day because in your opinion its already won/lost also see [ election silence ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/election_silence ) , its a way of approaching elections thats very rare in the english-speaking world and more common in eastern europe , it usually also prevents candidates from campaigning in the last few days before an election , to give a `` cooling off '' period in which voters can reflect on the arguments and agendas of the available candidates . 
  it also stops candidates from attacking each other shortly before elections , a situation that might not give the attacked candidate enough time to respond to accusations before election day, 
  tomorrow sometime between 6 and 8 pm to be precise ( or whenever the voting booths close in greece ), 
  check [ this article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-right-wing-populists-provoke-salafist-violence-in-bonn-a-831810.html ) , basically a rightwing anti-muslim party called pro-nrw held a protest in front of one of germanys biggest mosques by holding up large banners containing the mohammed caricatures . 
  the salafists responded by attacking the police ( which anticipated the riots and was present with hundreds of policemen ) . 
  they stabbed several of the policemen and went completely nuts . 
  most germans , including the muslim community , agreed that even though the pro-nrw guys were assholes , they had a right to protest and it was well covered by german freedom of speech laws , while the salafists acted like civil war was breaking out . 
  this happened after several high profile [ arrests ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/2007_bomb_plot_in_germany ) over a 2007 bomb plot by german salafist convertites and a salafist campaign to distribute the koran to millions of germans . 
  also check [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n2kcsc_zci ) of the salafist riot in bonn last month , its also noteworthy that high profile leaders of the moderate muslim community were present during that riot , going in between the frontlines while trying to stop the salafists from attacking anyone , this was well received by the german public, 
  til , thanks for the info , i thought this was a purely german proverb :-), 
  we have a fitting proverb for this in germany : `` man soll schlechtem geld kein gutes geld hinterherwerfen ''  `` do n't throw good money ( that can still be saved/regained ) after bad money ( which is already lost/will never be paid back ) '', 
  second to third generation , there are very few first generation immigrants among them, 
  convertites are among the most radical , the theory behind is that they feel that they have more `` to proof '' . 
  as they were n't born into a muslim society , they think they have some catching up to do . 
  check out [ pierre vogel ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/pierre_vogel ) , a redhaired german ex-boxer who is now considered to be a leading force and one of the most outspoken members in the salafist community, 
  germanys biggest fear is hyperinflation , the images from the weimar republic showing people moving their paychecks in cartwheels are ingrained in our collective memory . 
  no german government will ever allow simple money printing as a `` solution '' to this crisis , as we know what the consequences can be, 
  mostly second and third generation immigrants , and they are estimated to have a hard core of around 2000-4000 people in germany . 
  there are also quite a few convertites of western european decent among them . 
  i usually do n't agree with secretary friedrich , but that was an appropiate reaction to all the shit these assholes have been pulling in the last few months ( pro nrw are assholes too , but if these stoneage muslims have a problem with the freedom of speech in this country they can fuck right off ), 
  as this is an important step towards turkey being deemed acceptable to join the european union it is posted correctly in / r/europe, 
  people tend to forget that the main job of the european union is to keep us from killing each other , and it has done a mighty fine job at that for decades now . 
  fuck those billions we are sending to greece as long as the stability of the union prevents me from ever having to go to war with my neighbours again, 
  you call rammstein `` house and dance music '' ?? 
  sounds fair to me :-), 
  nobody doubts that turkey made great progress in recent years , give it another decade and you probably have a decent shot at entering the eu, 
  some of the human rights abuses amnesty international reports date back to 2010 , thats pretty recent, 
   whats wrong with the treatment of the kurdish population ? 
  [ lolwut ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurds_in_turkey#racism_and_intolerance ), 
  whoa in the same paragraph you first ask who gives a flying fuck about our club and then complain that you are n't being allowed in . 
  what 's it gon na be ? 
  and even if that problem is somehow solved , there is still turkeys treatment of the kurdish population , the failure to acknowledge and amend for the armenian genocide , the paragraph 301 ( which is totally incompatible with eu laws ) and lots of other shit to deal with before you 'll be allowed to become a member . 
  turkey still has a long way to go, 
  well there is your number one reason for not becoming a member of the european union anytime soon . 
  protip : do not threaten the members of a club you are trying to join, 
  agreed , the only thing that is not acceptable is tsipras `` we like to skip over austerity measures and still receive money from you guys '' pipedream , i hope greek voters are smart enough to see that this guy is full of shit, 
  thats what the us did after 9/11 , instead of one day it has been a decade of abolishing achievements of civilization , and look where it got them . 
  norway took the much tougher route of keeping their principles up even in the face of unthinkable acts of terrorism, 
  as a german born in the early 80s i got ta say that i do n't feel any guilt over the holocaust , but instead a heightened sense of responsibility never to allow something similar to happen again anywhere in the world, 
  i live in frankfurt , on the other side of the luftbr\u00fccke memorial * long distance high five *, 
  i 've heard about that before as well , and indeed it was quite windy on sunday ( though berlin in general is a pretty windy city , the surrounding area does n't have any mountains to slow it down ), 
  exactly , the question was n't `` whats good about your country , that is handled worse everywhere else '' , it was what we take for granted, 
  being totally safe in every part of town at every time of the day . 
  i am from frankfurt , which is considered one of the more criminal cities in germany , and yet neither me nor anyone i know personally has ever been mugged , robbed at gunpoint or beaten up for no reason while just walking through town while minding their own business . 
  everytime i have friends from other countries here for a visit , they 'll ask if there is any place they better not go at night , and our answer is usually : `` nope , welcome to the first world '' `` bad parts of town '' is an entirely foreign concept to me also , our police forces can truly be considered `` your friend and helper '' , the only time they tend to go out of line is during massive protest marches , every interaction i have ever had with them outside of protests was civilized , friendly and helpful ( case in point : i was at the carnival of cultures in berlin last weekend , and at one point i could see people ripping street signs out so folks could high-five the stop sign they paraded around , while some guys did cocaine in the middle of the street right next to them , all the while 5 cops saw it all with a bored expression on their face while eating some kebabs . 
  it was like `` nobody is getting hurt?everything is * in ordnung * then '' , i dare you to try that shit in any other part of the world without getting arrested in seconds ) and finally : no natural disasters at all . 
  hurricanes , tsunamis , volcano eruptions and earthquakes are all things we only see in the news . 
  a little bit of overflooding in east german rivers and a stormflood in northern germany once every few decades is about as bad as it gets , with death counts usually in the single digits, 
  down in malta ( where they drive similarly reckless ) they told me a simple trick : never make eye contact with the car drivers when you are trying to cross a road as a pedestrian . 
  if you make eye contact , they know for sure that you have seen them and will assume that you will have enough self-preservation instinct to let them drive first , if you do n't they will stop and let you cross, 
  as a german i can tell you that you and your countrymen actually impress us with the way you are trying to get your economy in decent shape again .
