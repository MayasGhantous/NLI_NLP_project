  i have n't heard a single german complain about ungrateful and lazy portuguese citizens , same goes for the irish . 
  has something to do with not parading pictures of our chancellor in full nazi attire around town as well, 
  i am not saying that the greeks are n't working hard , i am saying that they are n't working * hard enough * for the welfare state they have . 
  the germans can do that as their productivity per hour worked is a lot higher . 
  greeks problem is that they are n't willing to take the hard measures necessary . 
  they try to have a first world standard of living without the productivity to back it up , and thats a problem that only the greeks can solve , and their nation needs to man up and bite into the sour apple to do so . 
  western/northern european countries pumping money into that economy is not a valid long term solution , greece going down to a standard of living appropiate to their economic capabilities is, 
  its a greek problem , the greek people voted for the parties that enabled this shit to take place . 
  just for comparison , the majority of german parties last year refused a plan from merkels government to lower taxes to `` reward '' citizens after having their taxes raised and suffering cuts to our welfare state for a decade ( reforms that enabled us to face the 2008 crisis in the first place ) . 
  it was seen as irresponsible in the current state of economy to just give out money that was needed elsewhere . 
  a vast majority of german voters backed this . 
  i have yet so see a majority of greek people agreeing to refuse gifts from their government so that the country as a whole may profit i think christine lagarde is absolutely right when she said that the greeks should stop complaining and start paying taxes instead . 
  in the current situation the greeks do n't need our bailout money or our symphaties , they need a bunch of german tax collectors to help them out, 
  hours worked does not equal productivity , greece shows up both on the list of most hours worked and least productive who is the better employee , the one who gets all his work done in 8 hours or the one who barely manages his work in 15 hours ? 
  as a german , that betting scandal puts the fear of god in me right now ... because the last time they had a scandal like that was in 2006 , and while everyone thought that their crisis would slow down the italian team they proceeded to win the world cup , and i am getting sick of seeing germany place second or third :-), 
  citation needed, 
  yep , as the guy was divorced and had to pay alimony that puts him in an income bracket that was dangerously low compared to all the heads of state he surrounded himself with, 
  if greeks government does a better job ( instead of disassembling and calling for reelections every few months ) they deserve better pay . 
  our economy is doing fine , why should n't they get a modest pay raise after not having one in a decade ? 
  merkel earns around 240.000 euros a year , while that sure is a lot of money i think its an entirely appropiate wage for being the chancellor of 82 million people . 
  if high ranking politicians do n't earn enough it makes them much more susceptible for bribes and corruption ( case in point is ex-president of germany christian wulff ), 
  do n't worry , the german-french relations and cooperation are not really dependant on the people elected to head of state , think back to helmut kohl and francoise mitterand , one a diehard conservative , the other a socialist and together they got europe through some tough times , it 'll be the same with merkel and hollande, 
  what other term should we use ? 
  all your examples are correct , buy keep in mind that the ukraine is a lot closer by . 
  human rights violations in our neighbourhood are a greater cause of concern to us europeans than atrocities in africa, 
  she 'd probably be in prison over here , but she 'd receive proper medical attention in there as well, 
  the leader was the guy with the moustache , merkels official nickname is `` mutti '' ( aka `` mommy '' ), 
  helsinki is awesome , but i only spend 3 days there so i do n't know too much about it :-(, 
  vienna is one of the most beautiful cities in the entire world , stockholm is also highly recommended, 
  football is our holy cow over here in krautland , merkel boycotting a possible euro final with germany is like her not attending a g8 summit, 
  only a handful of turkish cities have a higher population of turks than berlin :-), 
  well technically the fries become german in origin every time we invade the french, 
   what is the extent of bribes or tax avasion ? 
  again , it depends . 
  for example , german companies bribe officials in other countries , in order to sign lucrative deals . 
  switzerland is europe 's ( actually , earth 's ) laundering machine . 
  there is a vital difference between your examples and the situation in greece . 
  while german bribes , swiss money laundering and greek tax evasion are all immoral ( and except the swiss case straight up illegal ) , the swiss and the germans do it for the profit of their own economies , while the greek people hurt their own economy . 
  the germans do n't bribe each other , they bribe people in foreign countries , the swiss do n't launder their own money ( which would hurt their economy ) , they are laundering everyone elses money , to the advantage of their own country . 
  they are messing with the rules of other countries and make profit in the process , the greek just fuck over their own economy, 
  israel is a close ally of germany , and many germans have a problem with people from islamic nations in general ( not my personal opinion , but that sentiment is very real and can often be traced back to animosities and tensions with the turkish immigrant community ) , so they tend to support israel as the culturally closer of the two sides far easier . 
  israels security is also part of the german reason of state , and has been for decades shit like [ this ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/national/20091015-22587.html ) does n't help the bilateral relations between germany and iran , same as [ ahmadinejad denying the holocaust live on german state tv ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/israel/comments/r4w29/ahmadinejad_called_the_holocaust_a_lie_in_german/ ) , thats a criminal offense around here, 
  most german news sites have grass poem as the headline right now , some are running `` why grass is wrong '' articles , some are agreeing with him and the forum activity feels like the day michael jackson died short version : the german right sides with israel and accuses grass of being a notorious antisemite , while many commentators ( though as i see it right now still a minority ) agree with him and accuse everyone counterarguing to be a rightwing asshole it 's fascinating to watch right now, 
  the shitstorm ( from both sides ) on some of the major german news forums ( spiegel online , zeit.de ) is just insane right now, 
  true story : german policemen routinely call romas `` mem '' , stands for `` mobile ethnic minority '' ( `` mobile ethnische minderheiten '' ), 
  i do n't know where you are from , but around here in germany that is a major point of critizism being directed at the muslim immigrant communities, 
  not only in the gdr , that nickname was in use on the other side of the border as well :-), 
  while enjoying her life in chile , financed by a german state pension for widows , which she is still receiving because of her husbands previous `` employment '' for the german state i love my country , but sometimes our bureaucracy leads to some very weird things ( i posted this in the other thread about the documentary as well before i saw that this was probably the main thread about it ), 
  while enjoying her life in chile , financed by a german state pension for widows , which she is still receiving because of her husbands previous `` employment '' for the german state i love my country , but sometimes our bureaucracy leads to some very weird things, 
   also , this has to stop , or we wo n't be able to mock americans and their weird political shenenigans for much longer because we will be far more ridiculous . 
  this could be the greatest reason for european unity i have ever heard :-), 
  i disagree , [ this ] ( http://www.taz.de/uploads/images/684x342/fb-theresienstadt.20110617-15.jpg ) is the league match plan of kz theresienstadt , and [ this ] ( http://www.rund-magazin.de/uploads/images/am_ball/profi/kz.jpg ) is a picture of a match in kz dachau , there was indeed some football playing going on at the german concentration camps, 
  i am a teacher in hessen , g8 was the greatest bullshit ever introduced in the education system of this country . 
  the traditional abitur , which featured a widespread education including years of arts , music , sports lessons etc was replaced with a system that has no other purpose but to drill worker drones for the job market as quickly as possible . 
  the way the g8 system was introduced really fucked with the ongoing education of many german pupils , because it was changed during kids education , instead of just determining that the next generation of pupils would have 12 years and planning this from the 1st to the 12th grade they just changed it for kids which were in 6th or 8th grade , completely fucking up the curriculum . 
  seriously , i have pretty deep knowledge of the effects this had on the german school system , and they are all bad . 
  the problem with the german school system is that is is not regulated enough . 
  try raising your kids in schleswig-holstein till they are 10 years old and then move to bayern , your kids will be completely lost as we are unable to have an education standard for the entire nation , every state government does what it wants with the system ( because its one of the few things were the l\u00e4nder have more authority than the bund ) and few of them are compatible imho healthcare should be completely nationalized and public , the way its split into private and public right now is just bullshit . 
  right now we have a situation in which many former privately insured `` selbstst\u00e4ndige '' ca n't afford their insurances anymore and suddenly the public system has to catch them while the private insurance companies try to only get the customers that are young and healthy and when i look at the current financial and euro crisis , many companies and banks were able to fuck up our economy because they were not regulated enough . 
  the banks had free reign and look where it got us, 
  die linke gets 15 % in the saarland because its lafontaines homebase , and they receive even more in the east germany . 
  please explain why you think thats insane , imho they deserve those votes much more than cdu and fdp combined, 
  the pirates succefully boarded the landtag , they are estimated to have gotten 7-8 % of the votes :-), 
  he 's the secretary of finance , not the chancellor . 
  and unlike most of southern europes equivalents in his job , he knows how to handle money properly, 
  well to be fair , only one of these `` scandal-marred subs '' was actually built in germany http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_214_submarine  a contract to build three boats for the hellenic navy was signed 15 february 2000 and a fourth one was ordered in june 2002 . 
  the first boat was built at hdw in kiel , germany and the rest at the hellenic shipyards co. in skaramangas , greece . 
  the hellenic navy named them the papanikolis class . 
  the 214 works great for the german navy , maybe the greeks fucked it up themselves when they built them, 
  hessian , german , european , world citizen in that order :-), 
  by giving him the same legal treatment every other criminal gets ( including a good lawyer and a fair trial ) we demonstrate the superiority of our justice system , its the hardest blow you can deal to assholes like these, 
  instinkt was most likely born many decades after ww2 , how is the holocaust his fault again ? 
  modern day germans are as responsible for what happened as a modern day italian is responsible for the roman burning of carthage, 
  have a look at the swiss , a few weeks ago they had a vote to extend minimum guaranteed yearly holidays from 4 weeks to 6 . guess what ? 
  they voted against it for the benefit of their own economy . 
  so it is indeed entirely possible even for large populations to vote intelligently even if that means losing/not gaining short term benefits, 
  you make a good point , but the greeks somehow did n't understand yet that their current economy is unable to sustain a proper first world welfare state , yet they are trying to give their people all the social benefits that french , german , scandinavian workers get and when their country goes bankrupt they blame it on evil banks and evil germans instead, 
  at least the turks pay us as agreed upon ;-), 
  government propaganda ? 
  in case you do n't follow german politics too closely , it 's angela merkel who is defending the bailouts against an ever growing part of german society who likes to stop sending one way checks to athens, 
  bias ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index greece is deep in the red zone , somewhere in the neighbourhood of great nations like el salvador , lesotho and ( wink wink ) romania you are welcome to try to disprove my argument that greece is corrupt, 
  oh the paragraph was full of content , i 'll repeat it if you did n't get it the first time : if you are such a paragon of economic insight , and every other greek around seems to be one too , please explain why you guys managed to bankrupt your country so thoroughly while the northern half of the continent is doing just fine i am getting sick of having to endure more taxes and less wage raises to finance the bankruptcy of a country thats notorious for tax evasion and government overspending, 
  take a deep hard breath and think about how your country managed to go down the shitter so bad , eventually you 'll come to your senses and realize that the reasons have more to do with work attitude , overall productivity ( or lack thereof ) and tax paying behaviour than with evil germans and greedy banks . 
  must be nice to have a boogeyman to blame for everything though , makes for nicer bedtime stories, 
  we all know that greece loves to fake statistics , thats whats gotten them into the eurozone in the first place, 
  from the article  moreover , there is reportedly pressure placed on greece to honor existing armament contracts we obviously insist on that , contracts have been placed , german companies already started building some of that stuff , and they have every right to be paid like agreed upon , and greece does n't need a push from germany to buy way more arms than they need , its the silly rivalry with turkey , which is a fellow nato ally , thats eating up greek ressources , combine that with strong military influence in state affairs ( a relict of the military dictatorship ) and you got a state that likes to buy more war gadgetry than they can afford i think it 's silly how all the greeks around here on reddit claim they know how to handle the crisis better than everyone else advising them . 
  if greece was such a world center of economic knowledge and insight they would n't be in the situation they are in right now . 
  but obviously it 's easier to blame the evil german bullies than to have a good long look in the mirror, 
  greece needs us a lot more than the other way round , germany was doing fine before we got the euro , we are doing a little better now that we have it . 
  pumping money into greece 's corrupt little disneyland economy until they may or may not stabilize again sometime in the future does n't seem like an intelligent long term strategy for me . 
  imho we ( germany ) should cut our losses and make sure that greece leaves the eurozone asap , that will give the greeks the ability to use the best tool available to strengthen their economy , which is inflating their own currency . 
  italy loved to do that shit with the lira , and it worked fine for them over decades . 
  greece imports german products for less than 7 billion euros a year , thats less than 0,4 % of our gdp , please stop spreading that silly myth that our economy somehow depends on exports to greece, 
  if other european nations have better ideas how to handle the greek situation , they can feel free to implement them with their own money and influence that 's still my german taxpayer money at work down there , i 'd like it to he used in a safe and controlled manner , greece has wasted enough already, 
  because lots of nato members liked to have a kraut buffer between them and the warsaw pact , west germany was built up so rapidly so it could stand a chance against a soviet invasion of western europe, 
  i really like the term zombie constitution , makes me imagine all the walking dead zombies holding a vote in the barn :-) zombie 1 : braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiinssssssssssssss ????? 
  it did n't have to deal with the aftermath of a global financial crisis though , and in the first few years after they were implented ( until around 2005 ) , germanys economy was looking worse than in the years leading up to them , so in a 10 year timeframe around them it was a boom period compared to most of the other years, 
  fun fact : after ww2 russia , britain and france moved lots of german machinery and industrial gear to their own countries , as reparation payment and to get their own industries going again . 
  so the germans had to rebuild their stuff , with all the technological advancements ww2 brought ( it started with ww1 tech and ended with nuclear weapons ) , which was a big reason for the german `` wirtschaftswunder '' , the economic boost after ww2,
