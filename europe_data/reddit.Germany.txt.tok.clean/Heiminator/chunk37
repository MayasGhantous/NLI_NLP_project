  we did fine before the euro , we are doing a little better since we have the euro , but in both cases our economy was way more efficient and productive than everything southern europe could muster the true difference is that our politicians had the foresight to introduce some brutal reforms 10 years ago ( look up the hartz reforms ) , when our economy was booming and there was no economic crisis . 
  greek politicians preferred to pamper their voters with gifts financed through debt instead , and now way too many people act like this is somehow our fault, 
  germany to europe : how about you start taking some economic advice from a nation that actually knows how to run a decent economy and is not close to bankruptcy right now . 
  if all the nations complaining right now had a clue about this , they would n't be in the situation they are in now i am getting sick of having to help bail out half of southern europe with my taxes and then having to listen to all this bullshit , we are trying to help everyone out and we are accepting severe cuts to our own lifestyle to afford it , a little `` thank you germany for helping to bail us out and actually being there for us in this crisis with your hard earned cash and economic expertise '' would be enough , no need to run around with swastika flags . 
  instead all we get is `` oh you only wan na give us another 100 billion and you have some conditions so we ca n't just waste it again ? 
  why do n't you give us 200 billion without conditions you fucking nazis ? '', 
  seriously , if this would be the other way round and it was somehow germany that needed bailing out , i really doubt our southern neighbours would be willing to finance and support half the efforts we are doing right now, 
  i totally agree , the german spiegel online said something similar in its article about the crash : the invention of trains was also the invention of derailing , the invention of nuclear energy was also the invention of the super gau , you can not reap the benefits of modern technology with having to deal with some risks that can never be completely avoided, 
  holy shit !, 
  i am going skiing on friday and my planned route is taking me through that exact tunnel these crashes are sad enough when adults die , but 22 kids is just heartbreaking . 
  the belgian people had to endure a lot of senseless death and tragic incidents in recent times , the chistmas market killing spree last year , the joker guy who stabbed kids in a kindergarten , now this , its a lot of tragedy to handle for a small country :-(, 
  your dad is a wise man :-) it 's also important to mention the assassination attempt on lafontaines life during the elections , it changed the man forever, 
  yeah , kohl won because lafontaine opposed the reunification ( because , according to him , it would break our economy ) , but the `` bl\u00fchende landschaften '' kohl promised during the election campaign took quite some time to manifest i was born in 1984 , kohl was chancellor of germany for the first 14 years of my life , it took me until the end of primary school to realize that other people can actually run for that office :-), 
  the russian part is funny , you can tell where a german comes from by checking if he speaks english or russian , all the west germans learned english in school , all the east germans learned russian and east germany is still important for the german economy and culture , its just that they need some more time over there to build up their confidence and get used to living in a democracy ( there is a reason why most of germanys neonazis are based in the east ) , but in 50 years only historians will remember that this country was ever divided . 
  and in the end , west germans look at it like this : few other nations on earth ever gained more land without war than west germany in 1989 , and the downfall of the gdr is a daily proof that our western democracy is superior :-) fun fact : angela merkel , being from east germany , speaks perfect russian , and vladimir putin , having been an agent in east germany , speaks perfect german , so the two can converse really easily and are known to switch into the others language all the time when conversing, 
  yep , it explains some of germanys anger at having to bail out greece , west german money was already used once in the last 2 decades to drag an economically rotten country of 16 million people into the 21th century after decades of mismanagement . 
  i remember how my ( west german ) dad was raging when he heard that east germans were allowed to exchange east german mark to deutsche mark in a 2:1 trade , while 10:1 would have been more appropiate the east german accent plays a role in that as well , people from thuringia and saxony simply sound silly to a west german ear , so many west germans regard them as stupid lower class citizens that talk funny and cost the west a lot of money ( the girls over there are hot though :-) ), 
  a `` seilschaft '' is originally a climbing/mountaineering term , its the bond of people dangling from the same rope ( rope = seil in german ) , its being used as a term to describe people in similar , hostile conditions working together at all costs to keep themselves going , and is a reference to east german groups of former stasi agents/sed party members supporting each other after the wall fell to keep themselves in a position of power and covering each others asses from prosecution and detection, 
  yeah some high ranking politicians tried to keep the stasi files under wraps , as the stasi had uncovered lots of skeletons in many west german closets . 
  the stasi had infiltrated west germany to a much higher degree than the other way round . 
  and one of the biggest mistakes we made during reunification , and one of the reasons why there are so many sed/gdr apologists is that we did n't write a new constitution after reunification , east and west did n't sit down to form a new nation , the west just absorbed the east , and east germans are still being treated as lower class citizens in many aspects of daily life ( for example average wages in east germany are about 20 % lower , same with pensions ), 
  here is a good article about the study you mentioned http://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/nazis-im-auswaertigen-amt-die-sehnsucht-nach-einer-untadeligen-elite/1967374.html and even today that stuff is cause for political trouble , former foreign secretary joschka fischer prevented the aussenministerium from honoring former nazis that later served the federal republic , while his successor guido westerwelle resumed that practice right after taking office , 65 years after the war and these networks ( called `` seilschaften '' around here ) , are still a big problem , especially in east germany, 
  there was a big effort to `` out '' all the informants , read up on the `` gauck-beh\u00f6rde '' ( yeah , named after joachim gauck , our new president and first head of the agency ) , which made all the stasi case files available to the public and allowed people to read what the stasi thought of them , and who spied on them . 
  many people were shocked to find out that their most trusted friends , lovers and family members were inofficial agents for the stasi and while i agree with most of your post , i think that repercussions for not collaborating with the sed regime were brutal enough to justify immoral behaviour for many east german citizens , they did n't gas people , but they did n't treat enemies of the state much better than the nazis did , especially if non-collaborateurs had family members that could be harassed and punished, 
  the problem was separating the `` true nazis '' from the rest of the population . 
  we tried the same with east german stasi members after the wall fell , and it turned out to be almost impossible to keep even high-ranking former stasi agents out of the system , because there were just too many of them to send them all to early retirement also , many of these high ranking nazi officials formed the intellectual elite of german society , and germany preferred well educated lawyers and businessman with evil history over less educated people with less ties to the nazi regime when it came to rebuilding the country , the consequences can still be felt around here , as many german authorities tend to crack down harder on left wing crime/terrorism , than on right wing crime/terrorism, 
  too bad for orban that he tried to reinstate fascism while facing economic troubles in hungary , the way the eu fucks with his policies by withholding financial aid until he changes the laws is ingenious :-), 
  there are two big differences here first , serbia is a much smaller country than turkey , so whatever problems/issues may arise from letting them join will have less of an impact and secondly , serbia is still regarded as part if the ex-yugoslavia club , there are many nations in very similar historic situations surrounding serbia that were allowed to join , singling out serbia with different treatment would be hard to justify, 
  bullshit , if 2,5 billion euros more per year was all it took to save greece , germany could pay that without even blinking , the financial problems of greece are much bigger than that, 
  to he fair , hitler was indeed elected into office , at least on paper that coup d etat was legal, 
  germany was democratic during the 1920s as well, 
  kinda hard to tell the elected head of state of a big european country ( which happens to be the homeland of the majority of our immigrant community ) to fuck off and stay away . 
  the problem is that he treats the germans with turkish roots ( and often turkish passports ) as his voting base , instead of german citizens that have relatives in his country , and the second germany protests against that , erdogan screams that the evil nazi germans try to assimilate his people, 
  german here , our opposition to a turkish eu membership has little to do with your population size or islam being a major religion , our main reasons are : - cyprus dispute , if you wan na join a club its a good idea not to threaten existing members , especially if they are also nato members - erdogans politics and crazy shenanigans over the last few years , his nationalist sentiments are a reason for concern for the rest of the continent ( trying to tell the turkish immigrant community in germany to teach their kids turkish first and not integrate themselves too much does n't help either , around here he is regarded as a major saboteur of integration efforts ) . 
  his efforts to gain recognition and respect in the muslim world by messing with israel is also frowned upon around here - shit like law 5816 , which has heavy penalties and sentences at the ready for people who insult atat\u00fcrk and the turkish nation are regarded as completely out of place in a free european union , and must be removed from turkish law completely before a serious attempt to join the eu is made - unwillingness to accept responsibility for the genocide of armenians is a total no-go - unresolved tensions with curdish minorities in eastern turkey - and finally , we ( the european union ) are not too keen on sharing a border with iraq, 
  of course they are , but they try hard to deny that fact, 
  good for all of us then that your enlightened opinion is a dying minority around here :-), 
  are you posting from the retirement home ? 
  did n't know we had active redditors that were born before the second world war , kudos to you !, 
  what a stupid argument , just because we already have generated lots of waste we may keep on producing more could be the biggest bullshit i have read here all day, 
  its the other way round , the majority of this country , including merkels cdu , has understood the inherent risks of that technology and collectively decided that we are better off with renewable energy . 
  do n't worry , you 'll 1950 's worldview will catch up with the rest of us at some point ;-), 
  absolutely correct , and people need to factor in that even a perceived ( no matter if real or not ) increase of security raises the quality of life of a population , imho the whole abandoning of nuclear energy around here is a very worthwhile investition, 
  germanys big 4 energy companies are under constant allegations of forming cartel structures and secretly agreeing on pricing , its one of the biggest scandals around here, 
  yep , i am giving conservative estimates here so that reddits pro-nuclear nutjobs do n't get an immediate heart attack :-), 
  these `` inefficient photovoltaics '' are doing are banging job on my parents roof and , in combination with modern insulation , have more than halfed their energy bills , my dad has saved so much money with that and had such little trouble setting it up and maintaining it that he is completely convinced that everyone still advocating nuclear energy must be utterly crazy . 
  he went from being a cdu voter to becoming a diehard greens voter in just a few years and looks back at his former political attitude in shame, 
  i was n't talking about fossil fuel plants at all , most of our investments and research should go towards renewables at this point, 
  it takes a long time and a lot of money to build new reactors ( ask the finnish redditors how their newest power plant is doing , they might start throwing feces in your general direction for being reminded ) , if germany were to replace all its reactors with new ones it would take decades of time and hundreds of billions of euros , by that time even our most conservative estimates see us as having evolved into a society that depends mostly on renewables , so there is no logical reason whatsoever to take all that money and brainpower ( lots of scientists have to work on that , too ) and use it for obsolete nuclear technology ( which is a finite ressource as well , uranium prices are going up pretty quick nowadays ) instead of renewable energy there is literally no reason for us to keep investing in that dirty , obsolete 20th century technology when much better alternatives are in reach now, 
  keep bullshitting yourself then ( btw , nice way of avoiding other peoples sources , one of the links was frontal 21 magazine , the other austrian state tv , both reliable sources ) , but here is a text link that 'll give you some facts about insurance of nuclear plants http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economics_of_new_nuclear_power_plants#insurance your claim that there have only been 2 major accidents in nuclear plants worldwide is beyond ridiculous , theres a pretty extensive list right here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_and_radiation_accidents that should get you started ( and its not even a video , hooray ! ), 
  i really like to understand people like you . 
  what do you gain from publicly defending an unsafe , deadly technology that has much better alternatives ? 
  i totally agree , even here on reddit i have seen people posting the official soviet death toll of chernobyl ( around 50 deaths ) as fact , while every independent study on the issue puts the death toll more around 50.000 and if fukushima was no deadly disaster with longterm effects i wonder why the japanese government does n't allow citizens to move back there already , its not like japan does n't have overpopulation problems and needs the space if i were chancellor of germany , the first law i would bring to parliament would be forcing every high official of germanys nuclear industry and every politician who agreed to nuclear power plants in his state to move next to the power plant , inside a 5 km zone , with their entire families , including a clause that says that in the event of an accident , they are the last ones to be evacuated and the first ones to be forcefully drafted as liquidators, 
  `` nuclear reactors are heavily , heavily , heavily hardened . 
  even if you could hit the reactor core with an aircraft , accidentally or intentionally , there are numerous design standards in place ( in part implemented after 9/11 ) to prevent this from having any impact '' yeah right ... germanys ministry for environmental issues made a big study about that , the first of its kind worldwide that focused on plane crashes and terror attacks , the results were frightening http://www.thelocal.de/national/20110517-35081.html `` announcing the results of an investigation by the reactor security commission ( rsk ) into germany 's nuclear security , r\u00f6ttgen said four reactors -- biblis a and b , brunsb\u00fcttel and philippsburg i -- had `` no demonstrable security measures '' against being struck by even a small plane . '', 
  correct , thanks for pointing it out , i sometimes forget that not every nation has this and some people around here might be unfamiliar with how this works, 
  how about you inform yourself a little more , i take that bavarian flag next to your name as an indicator that you speak german http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_sshyyc8vo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym5lqzlhnoo and 2,5 billion for nuclear disasters is like insuring a 50.000 euro mercedes for damages up to a hundred euro, 
  yep , and its the one point that should even tell the greatest advocates of nuclear energy that this technology is n't completely safe . 
  insurance business is a money making enterprise , and not a single insurance company on earth came to the conclusion that there is reliable profit to be made from insuring nuclear power plants , while the energy industry keeps telling us how safe it is . 
  one of the two must be lying , and i do n't think its the insurance companies that are lying as they are the ones that lose business opportunities by keeping to their point of view, 
  all in prototype stages ( if at all ) , report back when you have a properly tested , proven way to handle all that waste that wo n't take decades to be implemented all around the world . 
  i will have died of old age long before these reactors will be in widespread use on this earth, 
  on some topics that have clear right and wrong sides of the coin i will make that accusation , same as people who defend the death sentence and waterboarding are clearly wrong in my opinion , no matter how they argue there is a reason why no insurance company on earth will insure nuclear power plants and their operating companies , if this was in any way safe technology , at least a few insurance companies would take the chance to make some money with insurance policies , would n't they ? 
  also , some food for thought that 'll give rational people proper nightmares http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schacht_asse_ii asse 2 is one of germanys biggest nuclear waste disposal facilities `` for the period 1906 to 1988 there were 29 documented water breaches . '', 
  `` water will always flow into a salt mine where the salt barrier in the surrounding structure is breached . 
  this happens when the salt barrier is damaged in the drilling operation or by plasticity deformation of the salt resulting in cracks . 
  asse ii is particularly threatened by water because the salt barrier is in some places only a few meters thick . '', 
  `` because of the high number of tunnel constructions and the decades of use , the deformation in asse ii has reached the state that the pressurised salt is losing its stability : `` the supporting construction is softening by creep deformation , plasticity effects and local fractures from the ground pressure . 
  '' [ 4 ] the institut f\u00fcr gebirgsmechanik ( ifg ) in leipzig which has been monitoring asse ii since 1996 predicted in 2007 that , from the beginning of 2014 , an increase in the loss of the load carrying capacity will result in an increased displacement of the capping mass . 
  [ 5 ] the shifts may lead to an uncontrollable increase in water inflow and make the continued operation as a dry pit impossible . 
  in 1979 a report on the stability of the pit building was released by a working group under the leadership of hh juergens [ 6 ] which describes the now imminent scenario of uncontrolled inflow from the capping mass in the southern flank resulting in the subsequent loss of the load carrying capacity . '', 
  `` after media reports in 2008 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] about brine contaminated with radioactive caesium-137 , plutonium and strontium , politicians accused the operator of not having informed the inspecting authorities . 
  on september 8 , 2008 , the responsible ministers of lower saxony and the german government concluded to change the operator . '', 
  this study was debated in detail around here , and the only people that brought forward the arguments you mentioned were industry lobbyists , most german scientists from all kinds of different parties and organizations agreed that the findings were significant . 
  thats why the study can still be found on the first page of the website of our federal office for radiation protection , an internationally renowned institution the other two links i provided specifically mention heightened cancer risks near deposit sites are you really irresponsible enough to take a chance with a technology as dangerous as this ? 
  good thing the voices of reason prevailed around here and germany is getting rid of that shit for good, 
  you 'll always have imperfect human operators , all it takes is a little human error , a terrorist attack , a plane crash etc to make a big part of germany uninhabitable.its completely irresponsible to accept that risk so easily, 
  yep , i love nothing more than guys like maslo claiming untested prototype technology to be the salvation of all our waste problems , some people need to stop drinking the industrys coolaid, 
  german links first as it is a german issue http://www.ndr.de/regional/niedersachsen/asse597.html ( ndr is german state television , a highly respected , reliable source ) http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schachtanlage_asse#krebserkrankungen_an_der_asse and here a link in english , from the bfs , the bundesamt f\u00fcr strahlenschutz is the official federal office for radiation protection of germany http://www.bfs.de/en/kerntechnik/kinderkrebs `` the epidemiological study on childhood cancer in the vicinity of nuclear power plants ( kikk ) resulted in the finding that in germany children under 5 years of age contract cancer , in particular leukaemia , more frequently the nearer they live to a nuclear power plant . 
  earlier ecological studies already showed an increased risk of children under 5 years of age living within the 5-km-zone around a nuclear power plant site contracting cancer . 
  since it was designed in a more elaborate way ( case-control study ) than earlier studies , the kikk study provides a more reliable database . 
  on the basis of the more exact methodology it could be shown that the childhood cancer incidence rate depends on the distance of the home to a nuclear power plant site and that the increased risk prevails in the entire study region , i. e. also outside the 5-km-zone . '', 
  you might wan na rethink your decision of volunteering your backyard as a dumpsite , its incredible how people can be brainwashed into carelessly accepting mortal dangers this easily so that a few companies can make even more money, 
  cancer rates around the waste deposits are through the roof , especially leukemia , especially for children . 
  radiation levels in groundwater are heavily increased as well and even the industry admits that this shit is leaking into the groundwater and if you think its so safe , can we store it under your backyard then ? 
  cause i sure as hell do n't want it close to mine , and if i do n't want it near me i can not possibly put that burden on some of my fellow citizens who are unlucky enough to live near `` suitable '' depot sites ( the selection process for these sites is another can of worms that is really , really ugly once you read up on it a little ) and the nuclear industry has proven time and time again that they will do everything to circumvent tighter regulation and oversight , there are so many scandals surrounding nuclear energy around here that it would be funny if it was n't so fucking dangerous and if you say its safe to store it for decades , can you , maslo55 , personally guarantee the german people with 100 % certainty that there wo n't be any earthquakes , terrorist attacks , meteorite impacts etc. 
  that destroy the structural integrity of the deposit sites for the next few dozen years ? 
  did n't think so the problem is that the industries and people who make money from this are n't the ones who have to take responsibility for this . 
  its the worst case of privatized profits and socialized liability, 
  which are n't in widespread use and will take decades to become so , and in the meantime more and more of that shit is being dumped under my fellow citizens backyards , do n't take the word of an industry that profits from this without being responsible for the aftereffects for granted this is how germany , land of order and proper proceedings , handles its nuclear waste : http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/29/29801/29801_1.jpg http://der-umweltretter.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/asse.jpg now you can take a wild guess how they handle this in less civilized corners of the world, 
  we 'll get there , the first big step has been made , and 50 years from now when oil really begins to run out on this earth we will sell our advanced green energy technology for crazily inflated prices to the highest biders :-), 
  soo ... which 2 of you asshats actively campaign for stricter copyright laws ? 
  nope , we are still exporting electricity to our neighbours on a regular basis , even during the coldest parts of this pretty brutal winter we did n't have any problems whatsoever to generate enough energy , even though the nuclear lobby claimed otherwise months before to scare people i do believe that it might be possible to built safe reactors , but the radiating waste still has to go somewhere in the end , and i think it is utterly unacceptable from a moral point of view to leave toxic waste that will radiate for thousands of years so i can safe a few cent per kilowatt hour while filling the industrys pockets abandoning nuclear energy for good was one of the greatest moves this country ever made, 
  the maltese shoot at them as well , and for every person that has ever been to malta that is quite understandable . 
  they have of the of the highest rape rates in europe , and most of these rapes are committed by `` refugees '' fresh of the boat . 
  that 300.000 citizen country can only take so many immigrants, 
  because cold , hard economic facts are a more important factor in this crisis than the patriotic sentiments of the greek people, 
  i love it when people run out of arguments and turn to silly insults instead , i made my points , i am waiting for yours face it : your countrymen fucked it up , and now your countrymen have to clean it up , no amount of crying , rioting , insulting or denying will change that fact . 
  you guys down there need to work a lot harder and go down to the welfare situation of the eastern european states that mirror your economy better than the rich western european nations club you so desperately try to be a part of . 
  good luck with that , you gon na need it , as the german milk cow wo n't keep giving for all eternity,
