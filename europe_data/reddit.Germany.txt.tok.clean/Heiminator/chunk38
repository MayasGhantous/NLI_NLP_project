  here we go http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_100022_19/02/2010_115031 : '' `` it is not only that our eu partners are angry about our lying to them ( and to ourselves ) about the state of our finances , nor is it only that they will have to help us politically or economically ( or both ) , but there is also the rather damning fact that in many aspects the greeks enjoy a more privileged life than their german partners in the eu . 
  through all this borrowing , greek salaries and pensions rose far above ( about 30 percent ) greek productivity . 
  this means that even if salaries in many cases ( though not all ) were still lower than the german equivalent , pensions were higher , and usually paid at an earlier age . 
  so there is no longer a feeling of the richer eu countries helping their poorer partners -- greece 's mess comes across as exploitation of the underprivileged by the pampered . '', 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/retirement#retirement_in_specific_countries : just compare greece to germany , 64 % of all germans aged 55-59 are still part of the workforce and have not retired , only 31 % of all greeks aged 55-59 are still part of the workforce http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2010/04/euro_crisis_0 : '' ... that the ruling elite in greece spent years buying social peace and electoral support from the greek public with a torrent of unsustainable public spending . 
  the whole package -- civil servants with jobs for life , endemic corruption , generous pension schemes , weak enforcement of tax laws , special tax exemptions for hundreds of politically favoured groups , the abuse of eu funds to bankroll farmers -- was a social contract , albeit not a very impressive one . 
  germany , being a sovereign state and a democracy like greece , has over the years developed its own social contract with voters . 
  in comparison with the greek version , it sets more store by thrift and budgetary rigour , paying taxes and monetary stability . 
  pensions have become less generous , but there is still lots of welfare spending on working age voters who fall through the cracks of the employment market . 
  the german government worked over the years to secure voter consent for all sorts of things : for agreeing to work in a capitalist system , agreeing to wage moderation or sending money to the eastern half of the country after reunification . '', 
  http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_1_08/03/2010_115465 : `` the late andreas papandreou 's strategy in the 1980s was to give the disenfranchised , who formed the bulk of pasok 's voters , a shot at living like the middle class . 
  if this meant throwing european assistance and subsidies around like political favors and giving pensions to people who had never contributed to social security ( such as farmers ) , then so be it . 
  at last , all those who had been shut out by the right-wing establishment which triumphed in the civil war in 1946-49 -- and which was thoroughly discredited by the dictatorship of 1967-74 -- would get to share in the wealth of the nation . 
  the fact that this new middle class was founded on wealth that the country was not producing meant that the economy broke free from all logic and went into its own orbit . 
  pasok established the national health system and poured money into education but it also undermined the gains by destroying any semblance of hierarchy , accountability and recognition of merit in the public sector . 
  this meant that no one really knew how much money was being spent nor whether those who deserved it most were getting it . 
  costs rose while productivity plummeted . 
  a wasteful public sector , in turn , condemned the private sector to inefficiency and lack of competitiveness . 
  new democracy , especially in the 2004-09 period , made the situation worse by doing almost nothing to cut costs and increase revenues , allowing the economy to career out of control . '', 
  http://thecitizens.blogspot.com/2011/06/how-did-greece-get-here.html `` greece had a ridiculously generous welfare state for a relatively poor country . 
  for example , greeks were allowed to retire with generous benefits as early as 55 years old . 
  that 's great for middle aged greeks . 
  but where is the money going to come from ? 
  the country was poor in comparison to the rest of europe . 
  the greek per capita gdp is well below the eu average . 
  greece also has a particularly under staffed and poorly organized tax authority . 
  even when taxes are -- on paper -- sufficient to pay for government expenditures , the greek government has extreme difficulty collecting those taxes . 
  so the answer to the money question was borrow it ! '', 
  i can do this all night , but now its your turn to come up with some actual arguments instead of just questioning mine with your silly oneliner comments in case you have n't noticed , there are real reasons why your country is in the shitter , and they have more to do with greek tax evasion , work attitude and corruption than they have to do with evil , evil germans `` forcing '' you to buy german submarines ( my favourite bullshit argument coming from greek redditors all the time ), 
  i can give you many more examples if you want to play the semantics game, 
  yep . 
  it 's a very simple truth that everyone who 's not living in a complete state of denial should be able to grasp . 
  greece grants its citizens social luxuries like a minimum wage , something that even german citizens do n't have , and you are hopefully not gon na try and tell me that the greek society is even remotely as productive as the german society is . 
  the problem is western european welfare state without western european productivity, 
  yeah its the wisdom of my people that i am willing to share with you here , my people being the largest exporters in the world , among the richest nations of the world , among the highest quality of living , among the least corrupt etc. 
  there is a reason why germany is filthy rich and prosperous and greece is close to bankruptcy , and it has to do with work ethics and working together as countrymen instead of everyone trying to avoid paying taxes and ripping off the welfare state whenever they can, 
  you should n't be worried about my life , its yours and that of your countrymen that is going down the drain , and only your own hard work will get you out of that misery and while you worry i 'll enjoy the fireworks on tv that your fellow countrymen in athens were so happy to provide for all of us one final protip , as it seems to be something most greeks have n't realized so far : to make money as a country you need to produce goods . 
  ideally goods that noone else makes better than your country , so you can sell them to the rest of the world . 
  trying to run a first world economy ( including a proper welfare system , which you guys seemed to enjoy for decades ) on tourism , olive oil and debt making is not a good longterm strategy , when your country realizes this , there will be hope for you good luck with your countries future , you really gon na need it, 
  three of your elected parties ( pasok , new democracy and the popular orthodox rally ) formed a coalition to make him prime minister , so the parties many greeks voted for then voted him into office , take it up with your own parties and parliament , not with merkel and sarkozy and of course we did n't want you to have a referendum , when my bank wants me to pay back debt money they dont allow me to have a referendum if i am willing to do so or not , i cant imagine that this principle is different in greece . 
  also , papandreou was jeopardizing the entire rescue effort for a cheap populist move you have two choices right now , you either agree to the conditions we have when you want more money from us , or you leave the eurozone , set back your countries development 30 years and enjoy the living standard of nations like bulgaria and romania for the foreseeable future, 
  so when greece as a whole knows that its their own fault , why do n't you act on it accordingly ? 
  raise taxes ( and make sure they are collected ) , lower wages , voluntarily lower the number of free days everyone gets , there are many ways to help your nation save money , but instead whole unions are going on strike when everyone should be working hard to raise the gdp and get the country back on track , there are way too many people trying to stop the saving measures being implemented to convince me that there is a consensus among the greek people that they fucked it up themselves, 
  nice that you just confirmed that papademos faked the data to get into the eurozone , he is your elected representative , not mine i rest my case , and i hope my nation stops giving money to your nation soon , we might as well flush our hard earned euros down the toilet , at least the toilet does n't complain about it, 
  the shit my grandparents did happened before my birth , so i could n't have intervened even if i wanted to ( also thanks for confirming my argument that people will at least hint at the nazis whenever they run out of proper arguments when debating a german ) , still i do n't complain about my taxpayer money being used for reparation payments dating back to ww2 on the other hand you live in the same time and space as these 40.000 greeks and yet you do nothing to prevent them from doing this shit , you do n't even tolerate critizism of these actions , and in the end its german taxpayer money thats used to rebuilt all that shit if you disagree with their course of action , why dont you get your ass to the parliament square and try to talk people out of burning down the inner city of athens ? 
  why do n't you oppose them instead of opposing the people that are giving you money so your state is n't bankrupt by midmarch after decades of mismanagement tolerated by the people ( while we are at the topic of each others ancestors , your parents probably profited from the greek overspending for a long time , now that its time to pay the bill its somehow the fault of greedy bankers and nazi germans ) want a good example why we are pissed ? 
  greeks are protesting because the mimimum wage is about to be lowered . 
  guess what ? 
  germany does n't even have a minimum wage , yet our money is being used to finance your social welfare system that we do n't even afford for our own people, 
  so the greeks are not burning down athens right now ? 
  then our tv news stations must have one hell of a special effects department , i havent seen smoke and fire this real outside of major hollywood productions , impressive , did n't know that this shit could be done on a small budget nowadays / s and i am sorry that pointing out the fact that greece faked and lied its way into the eurozone by manipulated economic data hurts the feelings of the greek public , please dont cry too much, 
  that letter is precisely what i am talking about , a bunch of conspiracy theories ( from what i gathered , german governments since 1998 are being blamed to buy off politicians , blackmailing them into making policy in favour of germany , setting up cartel structures etc ) , while the reality is that greece was master of its own faith/destiny for a long time , fucked up that freedom through bad decision making focused on shortterm results and now complains that other nations are trying to help out but require some say in your internal matters to do so . 
  nobody forced greece into the eurozone , they faked their way in , robbing themselves of the best tool for economically weaker countries to keep up with stronger nations , which is inflating your own currency . 
  italy loved to do that shit with the lira and did well with it over many decades and the most laughable part of that letter is the part where merkel is being accused of pressuring greek politicians into granting her and other german politicians immunity from possible greek prosecution . 
  seriously , is there a single greek citizen that really thinks that our politicians need protection from the greek police/justice departments ??? 
  placing one of our ministers/heads of state under arrest in greece would result in the shortest and most one-sided war in the long history of greece , no german politician feels remotely threatened by that and if you think that our media is keeping information and facts from me , please enlighten me , what am i missing here that makes the rioters of athens right and me wrong ? 
  prove the stereotype wrong then , all i see coming out of greece atm is rioting , looting , general strikes ( protip : striking in the middle of an economic crisis wo n't help the economy , getting back to work does ) , delay tactics ( greece tried to get the other eurozone states to pay the next rate of rescue umbrella money before they dedicated themselves to further saving and raised taxes ) , bashing of the people trying to help you please put yourself in our german position for one second , we are asked to bail you guys out with billions of euros ( that we will never see again ) and all we get in return is our head of state in a ss-uniform . 
  greece has a long history of lying to its european partners and faking economic data when dealing with them ( the only reason greece made it into the eurozone ) , so obviously we ask for real guarantees and a lot of influence over your economic and financial matters , everything else would be batshit insane for our own economy right now , from a german point of view , greece is like a shipwrecked person drifting in the open ocean that tries to tell the rescue party in the lifeboat to fuck off if they think that the greek will help with rowing the boat back to shore after being rescued , while also telling them that they know nothing about boats and the ocean in the first place and should listen to the shipwrecked greek who knows better i know i sound angry and pissed right now , but i got fed up with this shit a long time ago , we germans are being insulted while being one of the few eurozone countries capable of running a decent economy . 
  we obviously and clearly know how to run a proper economy much better than greece does and still people talk about us like we are the retards with no grasp of the situation , while being called nazis everytime the other side runs out of real arguments, 
  thats why i was n't talking about the greek media but about the greek redditors around here , and out of those i have yet to see a single one take the point of view of the majority of northern/western europe, 
  underreporting is a fair point , but even around here i have yet to see to greek people have a real debate about this , you 'll find big debates among germans in these subreddits , some blaming the ( german ) banks , others blaming the greek people for this crisis , i have yet to see a greek defending germanys point of view in this situation, 
  i got that , but somehow i do n't see too many greeks speak with a voice of reason and caution , nobody speaks up and says `` maybe this crisis is our own fault as well , and rioting in front of the parliament while trying to kill policemen with molotov cocktails wo n't get our economy out of the shitter '' and the anti-german sentiments get a little disgusting after a while , showing angela merkel in nazi uniform shows a level of ignorance and stupidity that boggles my mind , she is the one who is defending the bailouts and financial aids for you guys over here , while many germans do n't want to send a single euro down there anymore as we are likely never gon na get that money back, 
  the borg usually do n't burn down their own cubes, 
  german here , we are trying to save your ass and we put massive economic burden on our own country to do it , the least you can do is not being that fucking ungrateful we keep pumping billions into your little disneyland economy after your peoples unwillingness to properly pay taxes fucked it up in the first place seriously , if you take a loan from your bank again and again , and at some point the bank asks for more securities and guarantees because you keep spending more money than you earn do you start to riot in front of the bank ? 
  from our perspective right now greece behaves like a punk on a street begging people for `` a euro '' and then insulting them when they only give 50 cents while reminding him that he should find a decent job, 
  it 's just being put on hold to be debated further , though i got ta admit they stopped the signing process rather abruptly and on the last minute ( the order to sign it was already given to the german representatives on brussels ), 
  german here , there are people who share this sentiment over here , but they are a minority most germans are well aware of the fact that our economy profits much more from a stable eurozone than it loses by having to pay for bailouts we totally depend on our exports , 70 percent of which go to eurozone countries , so fiscally strong neighbours paying us with euros makes for happier germans than having a strong deutsche mark while our neighbours pay us with worthless liras and pesetas, 
  bavaria also decided to use linux for their government workers computers whenever possible , microsoft ( whose german headquarters is in munich , the capital of the state of bavaria ... ) shat lots of bricks, 
  nope , take that as i still disagree with you because you keep contradicting yourself , stop putting words in my mouth, 
  far right parties are not popular at all in germany , the npd doesnt have a single seat in the german parliament either, 
  we are backing up the rescue umbrella with hundreds if billions of our euros , several attempts to lower taxes in the last few years have been postponed just to make this possible , so indeed the german state and taxpayer are willing to sacrifice to help out the eurozone, 
  always the same cheap argument coming from conservatives , the same thing happens in the us all the time , when their own people are in power economic success is the result of hard work , when the oppisition is in power its just inherited from the last government , 10 years in a row are not inherited ... 
  first you say `` the labour party has not performed at all '' , then you claim that your economy did very well in all the years labour was in power , whats it gon na be ? 
  yep , we broke the deficit pact and it is only right that we should get punished for that , same as everyone else when they fuck this up , part of the negotiations cameron just tried to veto was a clause in the proposed new eu treaty that makes sure that countries that break the rules should be punished accordingly , cameron does n't seem to want that though ... and even if clegg and his liberals lose voters , cameron still needs a coalition partner to stay in power , who shall it be , the bnp?they seem to share the same sentiments about continental europe that you and cameron seem to have, 
  camerons coalition is starting to crumble as we speak , ask mister clegg what he thinks about camerons decision this week and it wo n't matter who 's in office after merkel and sarkozy , unlike the british our countries prefer to have a certain sense of continuity in their foreign politics , has something to do with being regarded as reliable partners by friendly nations , something cameron obviously still has to learn, 
  where did i talk down nazi horrors ? 
  i 'd like to see the quote , thanks its always the same , as soon as a brit runs out of arguments in a debate with a german its suddenly `` but you guys started ww2 '' , its getting old and if you are too exhausted to keep on debating just leave the thread like your country is about to leave the union , no one on the european mainland is gon na miss either of you enjoy being americas lapdog, 
  right on spot , the brits usually last less than an hour in these r/europe threads before they run out of on-topic arguments and start invoking godwins law also , as a person born in the early eighties , i refuse that historical responsibility for nazi crimes that crsp tries to put on me with sentences like `` dude , you lot started it . '', 
  it 's equally funny and sad how brits that were born decades after ww2 and had nothing to do with it whatsoever keep bringing it up as a cheap way to insult people in arguments, 
  the colonial wars were extensions of the wars being waged on the european continent , you did n't fight some african tribes , you fought the french/spanish/dutch etc. 
  that tried to colonise the same land . 
  this shit has stopped inside and outside of the continent ( no eu power lead proxy wars in the third world against another eu nation since the inception of the eu ) seriously , read up on british and european history , report back when you have, 
  nice try to to downtalk hundreds of years of british warfare , you guys enslaved entire continents , bleeding half of africa dry in the process also , about that keeping the french and the germans from dominating the continent : you seemed to have failed at it pretty hard , cameron was n't able to gain a single ally for his veto , the mainland superpowers are calling the shots now and have so for a very long time , i ca n't recall a last time britain was able to stop the french-german alliance from getting something they wanted done in the union, 
  the bbc seems to disagree with you , and i 'd wager they know more about the uk then you do ;-) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/16131346 : `` then there 's the issue of rebalancing the uk economy - stated uk coalition policy , which hopes to wean britain off its dependency on taxes from the financial services sector and slant the economy more towards manufacturing and exporters . '', 
  the nazis were n't the only people waging war on the european continent , as you seem to be so interested in the thousands of years of british history you might have noticed that you guys were involved in many , many wars http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_great_britain its a pretty long list ... 
  even members of camerons coalition are starting to take a stand against his decision ( including clegg ) , britain stands isolated and is no longer seen as a trustworthy , contributing , reliable member of the european union all because one man could n't step over his isolationist policies , trust me , you guys are the ones who have to take a long , hard look at your own house you 'll be left out of many major decisions in the future , you voluntarily took the role of the ignorant bystander instead of trying to add something constructive to the process and it 'll cost your economy dearly, 
  explains how you are able to know nothing about the union , even though you have lived in it all your life , how ignorant can one be ? 
  also , as you have n't learned anything about the eu , let me educate you : one of its main functions is keeping the peace in europe ( only britain seems to see the european project as a tax free zone only ) , and as there have n't been any wars inside the eu at all since its inception , its a very well functioning union indeed, 
  our economy depends on rich neighbours who we can export to , no matter what your press and politicians tell you about the euro crisis , its good for our economy if the rest of the eurozone remains strong and prosper with our help , and the only shift in the balance of power i can see right now is one moving even further away from the british isles and we did n't `` just '' align ourselves with greece and italy , we have been a well functioning union for decades now , do n't know what you learned about the eu in history class, 
  i am simply pointing out that there are countries on this continent that still have proper , goods producing economies instead of focusing on juggling around virtual money also : nationalism , really ? 
  i am the one advocating for the european states working closely together , you are the one advocating for isolationist , nationalistic sentiment to prevail in britain, 
  you see , thats the difference between britain and the rest of the european union , everyone else is at least open for negoatiations , britain , as always , just tries to block the entire process , cameron went into these negotiations with the clear , previously announced intent to veto , while everyone else tries to work together in a constructive way it 's the same shit the usa , china and russia keep pulling off in the un security council and its wrong, 
  you would be right if all these games were british-made products , we are just using you as a cheap intermediary for our ebay shopping , this does n't create mass-employment in factories and shops meanwhile , my 82 million countrymen keep exporting and selling about three times as much as the entire united kingdom combined britain stupidly killed its domestic industries in the 80s and then bet everything on a single card , the finance industry . 
  tough shit that the rest of the continent decided its time to do something about that precise sector , britain has now nothing else to fall back on, 
  http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=euro+vs+pound set the timeline to one year and you 'll see what i mean , the euro is in the biggest crisis since its inception and still the pound is doing much worse constantly britain is trying to prevent the rest of the continent from putting the banks that helped immensely to cause this shit in the first place on a shorter leash , the sooner we get rid of that fifth wheel on our wagon the better to paraphrase what a british mp said yesterday : britain consists of over 90.000 square miles of land , cameron is representing a single one of these in the inner city of london, 
  i 'll look forward to the british economy going into freefall after this , makes importing videogames even cheaper than it already is for us euro citizens cameron shot himself in the foot and somehow britain is applauding him for that , the guy just ended 40 years of british eu policy because he wanted to poker a little, 
  yep , but the german `` ruhe ist erste b\u00fcrgerpflicht '' predates that english directive by several decades, 
  britain needs continental europe a lot more than the other way round , and british governments of the last 30 years have again and again done nothing else but sabotaging and slowing the entire european unification process , everyone else could not care less about the eu reputation in britain , the way we perceive it it is already much lower than anywhere else in the union . 
  britain needs a plan how it will manage itself without the rest of the eu , not the other way round . 
  even countries like greece and portugal , who have their part in the crisis as well and do n't like what the eu forces upon them right now to get them back in shape , still cooperate and work with everyone else much more than britain .
