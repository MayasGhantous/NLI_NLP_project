  i know , it 's just ... depressing :(, 
  boomstick launchers , oh yeah, 
  we own missle launchers . 
  they are probably empty . 
  mr bean and dinner for one . 
  if we could only put all the brits on an island or something !, 
  gravitation destiny . 
  only racists would question the connection between a country and a person who swore to destroy said country , kill the men and enslave the women . 
  right ? 
  i am not denying it , but i seriously question the weighting between the words of one man and an ongoing financial , political and social devastating crisis of 5 years . 
  what of those two things would be more important to potential investors . 
  i do n't remember sch\u00e4uble being the first to talk about a grexit . 
  that was a topic for the whole crisis . 
  but ... he is not into germoney !, 
  fenrir !, 
  have you slain ze virgins ? 
  i need zeir blood to increase ze german gdp another 0.5 % !,

  uniforms . 
  in the future , we will wear `` olivegreen wih addidas advertisement '' . 
  hahahaha, 
  that is sad . 
  in the end , we need flying aircraft carriers . 
  schnitzel for the east . 
  now we 're talking !, 
  finally . 
  time for some good old j\u00e4germechs . 
  but this time , every country around us encourages us to do so . 
  even poland . 
  even freaking poland . 
  when that happens , you know you have to upgrade . 
  which is , probably , why the eu has a problem right now . 
  if you have a group of people and everybody says `` michel can do that '' , the group only produces results as long as michel does . 
  when michel does n't want to work in a group anymore and rather do his own thing , like everybody else , well ... 
  islam , eyyyy , allah is gro\u00df , alter ! '', 
  probably the extent of the threats . 
  these people obviously are being smothered by ridiculous swedish laws . 
  they need their own areas , free of law , pesty swedes , and racist things like police , firefighters and public transportation . 
  there are . 
  she is not an exciting celebrity , a clown or a pompous queen , but a politician . 
  that is boring but good . 
  ... with her support for economic refugees . 
  big difference . 
  that one half is really ok . 
  the other half , not so much . 
  `` if you do n't bring me jewelry , i will leave your home and tell everyone what a tiny dick you have . '', 
  progressive-level : vikings, 
  i wish swedes without culture could have adopted the strange culture of a neighboring country . 
  instead they took somalia . 
  i trust denmark to conquer the whole mess when sweden goes the way of ancient rome . 
  our eagle breaths fire . 
  the cringe is real . 
  mein language !, 
  i 'm uncertian if i should make the deal ... maybe later . 
  your comment just went viral , with over 12 points !, 
  haha , then we indeed disagree . 
  i would n't be a friend with 1 and 2 euro bank notes , too flimsy for my taste , 
  germany here : 5-star 3520 $ , 4-star 2212 $ , 3-star 1719 $ . 
  there are no immigrants , only new swedes ( or , as the cool kids write it , nu ` swedes . 
  do n't mistake them for nude swedes , those are different . ), 
  indeed . 
  got a very enthusiastic vibe from the man . 
  welcome !, 
  laughing is healthy  no wonder our economy is so awful , sounds like we have to adapt to other , more respectable economic systems , like the one in france or italy . 
  sure .

  hahahaha , the aloe shortage was great . 
  just according to keikaku . 
  raise them as germans . 
  educate them with the economic knowledge , inspire their leadership skills . 
  send them back 20 years later , and let the greek-german unification begin . 
  we have one . 
  it 's called the euroompean union . 
  like driving a bmw . 
   previous german governments , he said , had displayed `` greater political sensitivity and a post-national mentality '' . 
  this is n't about germany and greece . 
  money is n't paid with d-mark . 
  protecting the assets of multiple countries , acting in good faith with a debt-cut and several loans * is * post-national mentality . 
   for the first time openly made a claim for german hegemony in europe . '' i might remember that wrong , but germany refused to take a leading role in europe for the last decades and was heavily criticized for that , especially in the last years . 
   habermas [ ... ] said that by threatening greece with an exit from the eurozone over the course of the negotiations , germany had `` unashamedly revealed itself as europe 's chief disciplinarian ... '' and later  at the same time , by focusing on avoidance of open conflict , the eu 's institutions are preventing necessary political initiatives for expanding the currency union into a political union . 
  what do you want ? 
  first you argue about how insensible germany is , then you complain about talking about different possibilities ( ignoring how the greek government themselves in the dawn of the crisis used the possibility of a grexit as a threat ) , and in the end you want more discussion and conflict !, 
  you accused me of ignoring reality , remember ? 
  ah , the infamous source of the wealth of the nazis . 
  would he only have been stopped at time , the economy of the third reich would have crumbled . 
  behind a paywall . 
  you should have been at the court , as a witness . 
  obviously you know more than anybody else about the case . 
  my little greece , my little greece finance is magic, 
  if you leave the eu , you will get no more beer from germany . 
  ghosts of the past evoked . 
  17th state of germany confirmed . 
  oh goodness ... what if syriza had all the time no clue what they were doing ? 
  that 's why their proposals were most of the time nothing tangible . 
  peace is haram . 
  because it 's true . 
   he told the german chancellor `` it is in everyone 's interest to reach a durable agreement that will allow greece to resume reforms , return to growth , and achieve debt sustainability within the eurozone , '' said a white house statement . 
  oh really ?
