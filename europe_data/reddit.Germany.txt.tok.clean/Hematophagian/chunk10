  this obviously does in no way mean the uk should n't have a lot of leverage to persuade them to `` do the right thing '' ... if they would choose to do so . 
  why not google ?

  as it was the second the question would be : `` was pope celestine v '' forced to retire ? 
  it seems he retired volunatrily : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pope_celestine_v btw it was 1294, 
  nope - exactly that ... and i stand corrected . 
  til, 
  are people really that passionate about it ? 
  just for the `` this will show em '' - attitude ? 
  what 's your motivaion ? 
  summer is coming - votes will be below 30 % threshold ... end of story,

  until the renewables did catch up . 
  and for peak there will still be gas-turbines , like this one : http://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/2014/01/siemens-receives-fresh-order-for-sgt5-8000h-gas-turbine.html, 
   what could eu learn from fukushima shutting them down - that 's the answer which works for the majority of germans . 
  consistency is a virtue ;-) besides it 's the french spelling ... just got kind of caught in the wrong language, 
  retard , coward and uptight , is erdogan the president his dick stinks worse than a d\u00f6ner , even a pigs fart smells better he 's the man hitting girls , while wearing latex masks his favourite is fucking goats and supress minorities kicking kurds , hittings christians , while watching child porn . 
  and even in the evening it 's fellatio with 100 sheeps yes , erdogan is truly a president with a small dick you can hear every turk singing he has shriveld nuts ( = schrumpelkl\u00f6ten for the interested ) from ankara to istanbul , every one knows he 's a faggott perverted , full of lice and zoophil ( = beasteality ) , recep [ fritzl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_fritzl ) [ priklopil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfgang_p%c5%99iklopil ) his head is empty as are his balls , a star on every gangbang . 
  til his cock burns while pissing , that 's recep erdogan the president . 
  for the interested , i 'll post the poem . 
  actually he was quite clever , but still overstepped the mark . 
  he discussed `` what are actually the boundaries of satire ? '', 
  translation below, 
  that is a wonderful application . 
  and about ratzinger : see it this way : her `` trust '' is so strong it even makes popes to resign ... just took a little bit longer ;-), 
  merkel is especially good at this . 
  whenever she said `` sie/er hat mein vollstes vertrauen '' ( - ... `` fullest '' trust ) , this person knows he is fucked . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/shadowban btw - you are not , because i answered you . 
  * i wo n't resign * i can not resign and leave the gouvernment in turmoil * i will do my best to secure the functionality of this gouvernment * after long and thorough consideration i do n't want to further burden this gouvernment, 
  literally : `` disrupter liability '' . 
  you are on the hook for anyone who used your facility to do something illegal . 
  that is if you did not take the effort of protecting the facility . 
  ( hacking the wifi-pw would be out of your responsibility ), 
  i like how some polish are set to : * `` it is a human being , ca n't harm '' while at the same time * `` it is a muslim refugee - not interested in helping . '', 
  was n't the point for the uk having a distance between the parties of slightly longer than 2 sword lenghts ? 
  that pays ... 
  germany has 177, 
  join schengen and have visafree access is a whole different thing though . 
  i can enter the us without a visa .

  which wife is it ? 
  1st , 2nd , 3rd or slave ? 
  in snoopavision !!!, 
  hahahahaha, 
  about this `` can he shoot a kid , when the kid shoots at him '' seems to be a highly complex situation . 
  unsure how self-defense works towards this one . 
  interestingly enough the self-defense law in germany has no commensurability . 
  ( eg if the only thing to defend yourself against an attacker , threatening your life is a flamethrower - use it ), 
  and the amount of conservative voters ? 
  just saying ... 
  the situation is quite easy . 
  as long as there is not `` threat '' to another human being - shooting is out of question . 
  ever . 
  as a refugee can not be a threat to another person , as long as he just tries to cross a broder , there is no legal ground for shooting at him . 
  especially because he can just be arrested for illegal border crossing . 
  so the whole `` shoot them when they cross '' is just completely insane . 
  before you ask : * no , 100 refugees crossing a broder might be harmful towards a state , but as long as they do not do it with guns , there is no imminent threat . 
  * no 100 refugees crossing is not the same as a foreign army tryig to enter the country . 
  they import : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-13/china-iron-ore-imports-jump-to-record-in-december-as-price-sinks, 
  who is `` us '' ? 
  tatra in netherlands making surplus . 
  german steel production is highly specialized . 
  and as stated above the uk was opposing trade tarifs for cheap imports . 
  * in peace time , the nuclear weapons stored in non-nuclear countries are guarded by u.s. airmen though previously some artillery and missile systems were guarded by us army soldiers ; the permissive action link codes required for arming them remain under american control . 
  in case of war , the weapons are to be mounted on the participating countries ' warplanes . 
  the weapons are under custody and control of usaf munitions support squadrons co-located on nato main operating bases who work together with the host nation forces . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_sharing seems to be a us responsibilty, 
  an eu action plan to help europe 's struggling steel industry to be announced on wednesday is expected to include a proposal to levy punitive tariffs on subsidised chinese imports , a move ** the uk government will oppose .

  well - to me as a 20yr old it seemed to be the most free country ever back then . 
  this party is disintegrating even faster than the pirates party . 
  * head of party isolated ? 
  check * different chapters proposing agenda contradicting the whole party ? 
  check * party agenda trying to fuck over it 's main voter potential ? 
  check, 
  not that iot was the best idea , but in switzerland they proposed a law to `` stop overpopulation '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecopop which explicitly stated `` family planning '' in the constitution . 
  1966 udo j\u00fcgrnes won for germany with the song [ `` merci , ch\u00e9rie '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo4ybflb_2a ), 
  i remeber 20 years ago first time visitng a bistro in paris with a friend living there . 
  we both smoked our cigarettes and i grew more and more desperate in a search of an ashtray ... he just pointed to the floor . 
  examining the floor , it was one big ashtray that the guy swept clean every 15 minutes ... that was some foreign concept for me . 
  while the headline say `` europe betrayed us '' the subtext says : * in 1972 , edward heath signed the european communities ( common market ) act knowingly and willfully deceiving and betraying the british people into european rule . 
  his was an act of outright high treason and his government thus became an unlawful assembly . 
  governments can not bind successors . 
  though each successive government had the opportunity to rectify his treachery , none did . 
  each thus became an unlawful assembly also . 
  in 1992 , john major signed the maastricht treaty knowingly and wilfully stripping her majesty of her sovereignty , honour and style and rendering her and her subjects mere `` citizens '' of europe . 
  his act was ultra vires and one of outright high treason . 
  no law can result from treasonous acts , much less unlawful assemblies . 
  it is struck down by our common law . 
  every statute , eu treaty , diktat and influence since 1972 is consequently null and void . 
  britain has therefore never been part of the eu and our british law stands as it was before the 1972 act . 
  in consequence , those who affirm and uphold eu law , diktat or influence are openly treasonous and liable to prosecution . 
  * while all of this is bullshit , the constant `` our politicians did fuck up - blame the eu for it '' is a constant narrative that is despicable . 
  obviously it would be stupid to rule out the use of weapons you could use - the deterrence would vanish . 
  while this is true , he could have worded it differently . 
  using nuclear weapons in a 1st world theater is like lightning a match while everyone sits in a gasoline bathtub . 
  he could have ruled out a first strike option for europe . 
  something nato has not agreed upon since years ... russia took back it 's `` nfu ( no first use ) - doctrine last decade , while china and india are still comitted to that . 
  and israel ... well - they do n't have even ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_first_use, 
  btw for the interested : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfuyzhk5he0 it 's from a movie - but said to be quite realistic,
