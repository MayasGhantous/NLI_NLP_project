  chinese buys german factory in czech . 
  german re-invests in ... poland, 
  it must be net positive - cause as far as i understand it , the question of `` if they were n't here , would the job even exist/could be filled ? '', 
  was not added to the perspective . 
  on the 2nd june of 1967 the persian schah visited berlin . 
  protesters were attacked by his special police , german police did nothing . 
  the same day a police man shot a protester by accident ( the story goes ) . 
  the following weeks the raf ( red army faction ) was formed and started terrorist acts for years to come ... 
  perfect tl dr, 
  sure not trump ? 
  erdogan wants the video deleted in 1,2,3 ... 
  while we are at it : delete the protesting guys too . 
   if the refugee numbers were to continue , germany would soon need an american style militarized police force . 
  this requires a lot of money . 
  uuuuh yes - maybe a special force ? 
   undergoing a force modernization we know - we do finance that one with 28 %, 
   i think most people would not have any problems with executing members of isis . 
  i think most people have absolutely no desire to execute anyone . 
  especially not themselves - and neither forcing others to do so . 
  you wan na kill them ? 
  pull the trigger yourself ? 
  how much is the duster in hungary ? 
  and you are the one judging who deserves death and who do n't ? 
  says the `` devout christian '' ? 
  just from a purely economic perspective : giving people money that do spend 100 % of that money is quite a sound strategy ... 
  charming idea ... we just dont deliver them to countries that have death penalty . 
  moral and death penalty do contradict themselves ... as most would argue . 
  yeah that seems reasonable ... `` if we threaten them with death , they wo n't go to syria seeking death in war to be a martyr '' ... 
  most of them are german nationals, 
  sure you can ... based on evidence . 
  no evidence they could pass with `` i went there to help people '' . 
  one foto with a big gun posted on twitter would be sufficent ... but they realized that bragging is n't always the best idea . 
  btw - erdogan also desperately wanted to meet him in person - declined ... http://www.wsj.com/articles/turkish-president-faces-a-cool-reception-in-u-s-visit-1459114068, 
  paste the answer here to copy ;-) * the cossacks ' reply came as a stream of invective and vulgar rhymes , parodying the sultan 's titles : zaporozhian cossacks to the turkish sultan !, 
  o sultan , turkish devil and damned devil 's kith and kin , secretary to lucifer himself . 
  what the devil kind of knight are you , that ca n't slay a hedgehog with your naked arse ? 
  the devil excretes , and your army eats . 
  you will not , you son of a bitch , make subjects of christian sons ; we 've no fear of your army , by land and by sea we will battle with thee , fuck your mother . 
  you babylonian scullion , macedonian wheelwright , brewer of jerusalem , goat-fucker of alexandria , swineherd of greater and lesser egypt , pig of armenia , podolian thief , catamite of tartary , hangman of kamyanets , and fool of all the world and underworld , an idiot before god , grandson of the serpent , and the crick in our dick . 
  pig 's snout , mare 's arse , slaughterhouse cur , unchristened brow , screw your own mother !, 
  so the zaporozhians declare , you lowlife . 
  you wo n't even be herding pigs for the christians . 
  now we 'll conclude , for we do n't know the date and do n't own a calendar ; the moon 's in the sky , the year with the lord , the day 's the same over here as it is over there ; for this kiss our arse !, 
  - koshovyi otaman ivan sirko , with the whole zaporozhian host . 
  it 's a public channel ;-) state-funded ( actually tax-funded ), 
  lets reference all the media ( outside germany ) taking up the story . 
  so the answer was to almost raze the city ? 
  do n't get me wrong - i think of the pkk as a terrorist organization . 
  but neither is every kurd a pkk terrorist , nor is the constant fueling of this conflict for `` personal election agenda '' an acceptable way to solve this conflict that also clearly has a territorial dispute underlying . 
  supressing `` natives '' for the sake of the `` glorious republic of turkey '' will lead to further escalation . 
  and honestly - noone will stop the birth of a `` kurdistan '' 10-15years down the road . 
  it did n't even hit the european news yet - wait till this goes viral, 
  worst case scenario : the refugees deal is canceled , more refugees arrive again - you get more afd-support in saxony ... merkel closes borders . 
  happy now ? 
  and the ( public ) tv station followed up on twitter , posting english subs and an older video they already did : https://twitter.com/extra3?lang=de, 
  it seems he kind of lost it now . 
  definitley overstepping the line - with this and the german satire video `` to be deleted '' . 
  now he even demanded the video to `` be deleted '' ... 
  it 's like the euro-jackpot ... one guy wins 76mn - it could have been you !, 
  a belgian i know said `` as long as this so-called kling does not even speak my language , i do n't consider him and the state he represents relevant in any way '' ... and afterwards reluctantly driving home for election , because he would be fined otherwise . 
  like the czech rep. , switzerland and austria ?

  glad we could help, 
  as your links are mostly german , i assume that also would be the language of choice . 
  in last years tschick ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/tschick_ ( roman ) ) was highly praised as a `` coming of age '' book , also part of school education sometimes . 
  edit : just read it has been translated into 24 different languages . 
  fatih akin just recently started to make the movie . 
  obviously he stopped at the european border - the eu border that is . 
  donbass would be a pretty far fetched `` east europe '', 
   muslim terrorists you might want to catch up with the news : * officials at egypt 's ministry of foreign affairs responded to reports that the hijacker 's motives are personal , saying they were aware of the reports that he is seeking asylum and discussing his ex wife . 
  `` he 's not a terrorist , he 's an idiot . 
  terrorists are crazy but they are n't stupid . 
  this guy is , '' they said . 
  that 's not how this works ... that 's not how any of this works ... 
  including the world-famous bike-wrecks along the main street ? 
  do n't know , but it seems to me that cizre was not comnposed of 100 % pkk ... 
  finland has one, 
  but but ... it happened in germany !, 
  poseidon himself was involved, 
  you are right . 
  germany would pay a little ore , rest would receive a little less ,, 
  depends - still by large the minority opinion though . 
  that is what the `` turkey deal '' was about - deport them back to turkey ... and take in the same amount of syrians . 
  anyone agreed - now noone wants to comply . 
  neither is this the reason they arrive , nor is it the truth . 
  but besides that it does not provide a solution , besides even if we would shut down borders this would still be a relevant question . 
  bomb the failsafe energy supply ( diesel generators most likely ) and you should suceed . 
  found the afd voter, 
  wohooooo ... german puppets ... that 's a new one . 
  here have the `` invitation thing '' analysis : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ the deal was accepted - by all , including poland, 
  oh - the `` invitation thing '' . 
  well besides that discussion , we all are kind of beyond that . 
  remaining facts : * they arrive in greece * there is a relocation deal with turkey * all 28 countries agreed to that deal * therefore europe needs to absorb them ( probably 100k/year ) so - where to ? 
  so kind of a `` predator '' - mentality ? 
  maybe one should add a purely economic standpoint : if you put welfare to a person it 's pretty sure , that 100 % of it will be spend . 
  no other `` economic program '' has this kind of mutiplication factor, 
   europe 's generous immigration policies besides the mix-up of `` refugee '' and `` immigrants '' - germany does not even have an immigration law/policy  europe 's assimilation challenge looked unpleasant but not insurmountable , and the likelihood of yugoslavian-style balkanization relatively remote . 
  doh ... besides we had a 600k influx 1991 form former yugoslavia - 400k left afterwards  that means closing germany 's borders to new arrivals for the time being ok - `` we fought the law . . the law lost '', 
  as this comment section obviously has a very clear opinion on wheter this is a good decision or not - let 's talk about what happens next . 
  so one more country will not support the relocation of syrian refugees from turkey .
