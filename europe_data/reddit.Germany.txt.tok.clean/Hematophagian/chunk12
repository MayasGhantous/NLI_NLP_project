  where do they go ? 
  stay in greece ? 
  northern europe ? 
  coming down hard on banlieues is probably a given . 
  i believe this guy - because his nation pumped bn/tn $ in suveillance infrastructure . 
  on a side note : stop bombing/invading shit or selling weapons would be one . 
  that it is not . 
  if it would not exist the amount of refugees would probably triple in europe . 
  they are the one that keep jordan , lebanon and trukey camps running . 
  so it would be either `` daesh '' or `` isis '' or `` islamic state of iraq and the levant '' . 
  semantics is important here ... and again there is no such thing as the `` state of islam '', 
  no me is a friend of oversea non-torture ... like , say bora-bora ? 
  this is n't even about spying - it 's about identity checks foremost . 
  and just generally :  not all members of the nation of islam are terrorists but all terrorists are from the nation of islam or islamic state what 's the `` nation of islam '' supposed to be ( i assume you do not refer to the us nation of islam ) ? 
  i seem to remember the terrorists have mostly been belgian and french nationals ... 
  what is that about ? 
  obviously the data is n't accessible cross-borders ( and sometimes not even cross federal broders ) , which should change . 
   edit : it makes me fucking furious you people are trying to somehow downplay or justify four thousand and seven hundred people being detained away from any semblance of facility suitable for that purpose . 
  please go on , so i know who to avoid . 
  now you did ... 
  we are definitley the better non-torturers !, 
   believed to there are a lot of consequences - extensive jail time ... if the can get a hold of those guys . 
  you argued that `` detention '' was the wrong way to treat them - and i said , that technically since monday it is the absolute correct way . 
  well since monday they are illegal immigrants - which in all countries lead to detention . 
  now you can debate about this fact , or about the `` quality '' of detention - but we definitley passed the `` be welcomed in a refugees centre '' way to do things - just as the majority wanted it . 
   i 'm a great builder . 
  what do i best in life , i build . 
  your infrastructure is crumbling . 
  is n't it nice to have a builder ? 
  a real builder . 
  so you take precast plank . 
  it comes 30 feet long , 40 feet long , 50 feet long . 
  you see the highways where they can span 50 , 60 feet , even longer than that , right ? 
  and do you a beautiful nice precast plank with beautiful everything . 
  just perfect . 
  i want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they 'll call it the trump wall . 
  maybe . 
  so i have to make sure it 's beautiful , right ? 
  i 'll be very proud of that wall . 
  if they call at this the trump wall , it has to be beautiful . 
  and you put that plank up and you dig your footings . 
  and you put that plank up -- there 's no ladder going over that . 
  if they ever go up there , they 're in trouble , because here 's no way to get down . 
  ** maybe a rope . 
  ** donald trump http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/08/19/trump_on_border_maybe_theyll_call_it_the_trump_wall.html i love the saying : `` a 30-feet wall highly increaes the market of 31-feet ladders '', 
  maybe consider 2 facts : * most of the refugees are fleeing from violence caused by exactly those terrorists - you mixing both up , does n't make this untrue . 
  * the possibility that terrorists can enter the country as a refugee increases - but finding followers in 2nd/3rd generation immigrants is the much bigger problem . 
  yeah sure ... 
  if you take fassbender you could add sandra bulock ... 
  the `` influence '' part refers to your `` just write a letter '' . 
  if germany would send a letter saying `` we would like you to move out '' , the answer would probably be : `` we are entitled to have this base , because contracts , and either way we would shut you out of any cooperation also - no more intelligence ( which is one thing the nato heavily relies on - grant you that ) , no more buying weapons ( patriot-system comes to mind ) , no more troops training ( german air force often goes to us for training ) . 
  martina gedeck had 19 wins and 19 nominations for awards ; ulrich tukur 11 each ... til schweiger has ( this is the moment you see me starting to cry , because i misjudged it totally ) : 23 wins and 5 nominations ... waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh ( althoug inglorious bastards pushed him here quite a few ) ok you win, 
  probably a german-speaking country ... 
  first : that would n't fly with you guys ... that 's that `` influence '' thing i just said . 
  second : was n't the idea you proposed to `` move out of europe '' all together ? 
  what 's the difference in having that base in romania instead of germany ? 
  uh ... i hope they started the power-down before leaving ... 
  did n't he play in v-vendetta ? 
  revered = respected ... not known, 
  they do n't look very much alike ... 
  b.kingsley ? 
  in the end ? 
  not more than any of the other 28 . 
  this could only pass unanimous . 
  anyone could have stood up and said `` no '' . 
  if it would have been merkel doing the deal i 'm 110 % sure the distribution qutoas would not have been `` voluntarily '', 
  iran wanted to take over oil production , bp went to uk gouvernment , who went to usa gouvernment , went to cia , started a coup - voila . 
  whotf does downvote for this ? 
  here have the whole ordeal : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat, 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/ramstein-base-in-germany-a-key-center-in-us-drone-war-a-1029279.html  the documents , which originate from us intelligence sources and are classified as `` top secret , '' date from july 2012 . 
  a diagram shows how the us government structures the deployment of drones . 
  other documents provide significant insight into how operations in places like somalia , afghanistan , pakistan or yemen are carried out . 
  and they show that a central -- and controversial -- element of this warfare is played out in germany . 
   the graphics show that ramstein is involved in virtually every air force drone attack . 
  even if the pilots are sitting at air force bases in nevada , arizona or missouri , and even if the targets are located on the horn of africa or the arab peninsula , usafe headquarters at ramstein is almost always involved . 
   `` ramstein carries the signal to tell the drone what to do , '' says a us intelligence source , who is knowledgable about the us government 's drone program . 
  he declined to be identified because of fears of retribution . 
  `` without ramstein , drones could not function , at least not as they do now . '', 
  does it though ? 
  i mean the us could close rammstein . 
  no more power projection eastwards , no drones flying in yemen . 
  your choice , which we do not even care . 
  ( in fact we do care and would prefer the drones and surveilance stuff there would gtfo ), 
  i give you waltz - but do n't take romy !, 
  in this case we could forward her to france and alain delon as well . 
  hehe ... both are at least debatable , because although both have been born imn vienna , romy never held the austrian citizenship and christoph holds both german and austrian , but made considerably more movies in germany than austria . 
  edit : or did you just flag wrongly ? 
  absolutely not . 
  you asked what the `` deterrent '' would be for russia to start an ( salami tactic ) attack . 
  ( on this occassion i really like to quote [ yes minister ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe ) ) so to face the brutal reality ( aka realpolitik ) : crime is not important , caused russian sanctions , that already did cost billions ( mostly for russia ) . 
  so the moment russia would overstep the polish border they would be cut off from global markets entirely ... which would give them probably 5 weeks before completely shattering to pieces collapsing . 
  the major deterrent is : money . 
  crimea is not europe, 
  one thing you should realize : just as the japanese `` self-defence '' army , the german army is n't , was n't and will probably never be an army to `` project power '' . 
  so all the ressources needed for those nifty `` overseas war '' is neither available , nor in focus . 
  ( logistics , transport , carrier , airlift ... ) the german army was designed to stop thousands of russian tanks and subs to enter the country - which we all knew would either be impossible , or a matter of hours , because it would escalate to a nuclear scenario . 
  military = influence no military = no influence you knew the deal . 
  ca n't have one without the other . 
  another money sink hole with unfriendly xenophobix people ? 
  had that 1991 ...
