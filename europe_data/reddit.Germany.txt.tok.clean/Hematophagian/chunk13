   as a result of the iraq war told you so ... 
  the world economy does . 
  what do you think would happen , if the stepped into poland ? 
  none . 
  the deal was negotiated by tusk , after agreed upon by all 28 eu countries . 
  germany ( + living ) : actress : i 'll go with [ martina gedeck ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311476/ ) actor : probably [ ulrich tukur ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876300/ ) incidentally both of them starred at [ the lives of others ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/ ), 
  depends on perspective that lost generation thing . 
  overcoming a lot of bitterness . 
  and the label `` onoff relationship '' wont go well . 
  wan na take a bet ? 
  either way the majority will regret their decision 1 yr later ;-), 
  besides this completely hypothetic scenario ( as you said : negligible ) , i would n't be so sure that a decent amount of air2sea missiles fired would n't hit some ships . 
  i mean when was the last time that happened ? 
  it seems an israeli ship was hit by an rpg in 2006 , although it has near-distance defense ( ciws phalanx ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ins_hanit, 
  well - back then they had exactly 5 exocet - ( air2sea ) missiles from france , 3 misfired , one missed and one hit and sunk hms sheffield ( almost ) . 
  nowadays they developed the citefa as-25k and have probably some more of them . 
  not an uncommon cognitive reaction . 
  apocalypse tomorrow kind of relieves you from todays duties ... 
  did you read the title ? 
  seems panicky enough for me . 
  its not about what is , but what is perceived . 
  hope ? 
  panic when boarding ferry back to turkey, 
  the `` told you so '' reflex is unbearable, 
  anyone wants to take bets when the first dead person happens while they try to deport them back to turkey ? 
  smoke pot and the missing 99bn seem irrelevant ... 
  edit : jesus me gets downvotes while the guy promoting violence against the `` foreign mob '' gets upvotes ... this sub really turned it 's moral compass to south . 
  / r/travelprague would be the next step ... alas it does n't exist though, 
  i would assume that / r/prague would qualify even more though . 
  so the watermelons are the missing part ? 
  sooo - you are proud of that ? 
  the fact that you expect them beaten up ? 
  pretty sure her personal history growing up behind a wall does some influence, 
  absolutely . 
  the more interesting discussion not directly related though , is the question if this is manslaught , murder or nothing . 
  he was convicted for murder btw . 
  nato agreement . 
  you need those to drone-kill people, 
  yeah guess what . 
  the germans are completely unhappy when the us uses rammstein to steer its drones to bomb yemen & co or use them to have listening posts on german industries ... 
  i applaud you sir . 
  because we have some concepts we also developed that are called `` basic human rights '' , while the ruling family of sa is what i would call barbarians . 
  so should we lower our standards ? 
   gray goose laws very specific those guys : in the 8th century the lex alamannorum sets the weregeld for a duke or archbishop at three times the basic value ( 600 shillings ) , while the killing of a low ranking cleric was fined with 300 , raised to 400 if the cleric was attacked while he was reading mass . 
  i assume it seems basically the same thing for your family, 
  just came from a conference call with romanian software developers . 
  romania is the its favourite near-shore place . 
   likelier that a big company has better resources to occupy that niche than a small company . 
  that 's why many succesful start-ups are sold to bigger companies , right ? 
  that is absolutely correct - the rammstein song `` mein teil '' is actually a reference to exactly this . 
  you sure ? 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/04/germany.lukeharding * on the evening of march 9 , the two men went up to the bedroom in meiwes ' rambling timbered farmhouse . 
  mr brandes swallowed 20 sleeping tablets and half a bottle of schnapps before meiwes cut off brandes ' penis , with his agreement , and fried it for both of them to eat . 
  op : `` all of europe should do that '' you : `` then it would be germans/swiss/swedish that would sell weapons '' ... see ? 
  18tn gdp ; lets say 6 % for healthcar ... that 's a lot more carriers than 2, 
  one thing that came with that for good : the participation rose 10 % +, 
  the joke at least made me smile - have an upvote, 
  you are dead ? 
  you was a terrorist - there you go !, 
  the if was european-wide ... so maybe swiss, 
  especially when he seems to be russian - like this guy ... unflaired, 
  no they would just use us/russian/chinese-weapons ... 
  https://cardux.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/gomorra-capitolo-ii-angelina-jolie/ or english : https://tpzoo.wordpress.com/2009/10/24/angelina-jolie-the-tailor-and-the-mafia/, 
  well the mafia-operated high fashion couture production sites are quite competitive ... 
  in before someone says `` refugees '' ... which is actually very likely, 
  visas are not too much debated in germany - we already have 3mn over here . 
  here have a look on all cognitive biases : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases, 
  not even mentioning all the jeans that come with an immigrant stuffed inside !, 
  you need to get rid of those too . 
  this is the most trump-like attitude ever displayed, 
  it 's really scary how much energy is wasted due to missing insulation . 
  i just move from a beautyful flat in a house build 1900 to a flat build in 2015 . 
  the energy needed to heat was declared at 270 kwh/sqm in the old one and 48 kwh/sqm in the new one ... 
  it 's more the sanctions ( which cost 100thousands of lifes ) and the disbanding of army/baht-party ( which is the main source of isis leading personal ) that came after the invasion . 
  the invasion itself did probably not effect the creation of isis too much . 
  it 's even worse ... poland is installing hardware to stop the `` spill-over '' from germanys power grid , because whenevr there 's much wind their grid is burdened with too much load . 
  5.250 kwh is either for a 4-ppl household or you are mining bitcoins . 
  well mr.stubb seems quite a fashionable politician, 
  well north-stream just ordered 900.000 t pipeline in germany last week though . 
  i do n't think i would consider myself `` hysteric '' - but that tech ca n't be controlled . 
  and if it goes south the consequences are unbearable to me . 
  end of story . 
  what is it with your mind ? 
  show me the `` city center '' of berlin though ... 
  says the french guy : http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2016/03/04/un-incident-dans-la-centrale-de-fessenheim-a-ete-plus-grave-qu-annonce-selon-des-medias-allemands_4876722_3244.html, 
  who would be this `` enemy '' ? 
  now you will experience this : http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/baader-meinhof-phenomenon.htm, 
  relevant : https://youtu.be/whdiqztg1xk, 
  from the photo , this car does definitley not look as if someone put 100pounds of explosives in the trunk to explode and kill the surroundings . 
  this was a small charge to kill the driver or it was intended to do so and killed the transporter . 
  which seems to be a criminal gang thing to me . 
  good guy bad guy game ... 
  yes, 
  they even got the euro ... surprise, 
  `` do you got a flag ? '', 
  read the article : * `` the discussion has evolved . 
  the debate showed that the united kingdom was asking for rewards for not respecting the common rules . 
  under these conditions , i do not think that a brexit would harm the european union , '' * this implies the complete opposite of your remark , they think the uk would only hinder the further development twoards the common political union - which is absolutely correct . 
  which is not inherently wrong though - she always ends up on the side of the majority of german people and opinion . 
  at the same time this makes her also completely bereft of any kind of vision , long-term strategy or guiding principles .
