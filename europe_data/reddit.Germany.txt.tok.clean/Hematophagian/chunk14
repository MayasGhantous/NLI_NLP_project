  see how this is the beginning of a wiiiiide swing , which will end in a 180degree turn ? 
  a fine comment about here was : `` if everyone is on the opposite site staring at her , she just turns around and says `` see ? 
  everyone is behind me on this '' . 
  additional . 
  especially because the unions keep declining . 
  thx for all your effort, 
  they just mean `` no boobies '' , kind of like pis, 
  400k former yugoslavia refugees moved back in the 90s ff . 
  im sure they do n't . 
  because they are n't supposed to even think about it before marriage . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igtxpgmdqt4 not really - he was arrested 1995 - back then the banks did n't have that bad reputation . 
  and several regional banks got srewed also . 
  btw - the little castle in the beginning of the video was his house at the end . 
   was in trillions . 
  cmon 700mn is not nothing - they got 50mn last year already, 
  rt on youtube ... just doubles the expectation, 
  uuuuh there is a 700mn package on the way , it was announced that 20k places are available , soon 50k . 
  that a lie bro ? 
  shhh ... i made some brits salty and some funny answers - good enough ;-), 
  yesterday someone said `` afd is npd for better-offs '', 
  by my standard ? 
  a lot ... 
  courtesy of / u/doldenberg from / r/worldnews : see ( for now ) below , soon above . 
  the much better formatted version of the actual afd-program : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4acjau/farright_afd_is_now_pangerman_party/d0zcisu, 
  for all ... that 's why there is a definition which decisions are unanimous and which are not . 
  probably j\u00fcrgen schneider . 
  he was a real estate investor building especially prime real estate at germanys hottest locations . 
  the beauty of it ? 
  he mostly tricked banks !, 
  he prognosed much too high income for the projects , the business modell was so rigged , that one time he actually cheated a whole level into it , which did n't even exist . 
  he usually upped the capacity of his buildings by 10 % sqm - never to be build . 
  he ended up in jail . 
  giving up some souvereignity is an inherent part of joining the eu ... 
  in that case i definitley oppose the fact that 425.000 malt ( esian ? ), 
  would wiegh in the same vote as 81.000.000 germans ... and i think you can see why ... ( hint : it would be 160times the vote/head ), 
  the moment you dissolve countries ( which would be the actual effect of a federlized union ) this argument becomes obsolete ... 
  an easy look into `` what if '' is just to have a look on the candidates in sa . 
  they suddenly are in for 24 seats - a number they probably did n't even expect themselves . 
  the amount of morons now entering the parliament at number 10-24 will be astounding . 
   and a communist resurgence today is about as likely as another german invasion . 
  ... so you think ... hehehe, 
  additional context : most people accept the fact that the `` refugee crisis '' is a european crisis - and the state representative thye voted for has not much influence in solving this at all . 
  you guys are `` german '' too in this context :p, 
  re-read what the guy above you just wrote : * are disproportionately under-represented on a per-capita basis . 
  they could go with the saxe-coburg and gotha line ... oh wait . 
  lol, 
  watch it live : https://www.epo.org/searching-for-patents/legal/register.html hint : it already exists, 
  afd had most non-voters activated . 
  almost 14 % additional voters, 
  just glad / r/europe does not vote in germany ... 
  this actually really is the most stupid comment to a basic law and democracy rule as `` all are equal before the law of the country '' . 
  neither the rule of said country , nor me could give a rats ass about the judicial system of cambodia ... 
  shmelessly copy & paste of another guy : http://www.locopengu.com/images/media/750xauto/izv7e.jpg, 
  paschto and swedish sound quite the same , do n't they ? 
  honestly : why is it `` merkels '' turkey pact ? 
  yeah well forget about that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union, 
  if someone is bored and really wants to procrastinate : https://www.broadcastify.com/listen/mid/27 you can listen to the live feed of lasvegas police all day + night ... 
  decimate is latin and means exactly that - from decima = 10 . 
  it was a way to punish failed army units - by killing 1 in 10 for cowardice ( eg ), 
  this - so basically : it works !, 
  tbf force projection was never an option for germany . 
  now think back who just brought up the idea to kill the 500 $ notes last week ? 
  and yes you can now see a rise in sales of house safes, 
  they start buying bonds directly from companies , circumventing banks . 
  the ecb should not do that , because evaluating 6000 european banks and defining their risk is one thing . 
  doing that with corporate bonds is a totally different game . 
  john snows they are, 
   will of the people their will is stability . 
  absolutely ... but in case of low interest rates, 
  mistyped - just edited - see above ;-), 
  you got that wrong ... they try to achieve inflation and risk a deflation-spiral * deflationary spiral [ edit ] main article : debt deflation a deflationary spiral is a situation where decreases in price lead to lower production , which in turn leads to lower wages and demand , which leads to further decreases in price . 
  [ 27 ] since reductions in general price level are called deflation , a deflationary spiral occurs when reductions in price lead to a vicious circle , where a problem exacerbates its own cause . 
  in science , this effect is also known as a positive feedback loop . 
  another economic example of this principle is a bank run . 
  the great depression was regarded by some as a deflationary spiral . 
  [ 28 ] a deflationary spiral is the modern macroeconomic version of the general glut controversy of the 19th century . 
  another related idea is irving fisher 's theory that excess debt can cause a continuing deflation . 
  whether deflationary spirals can actually occur is controversial , with its possibility being disputed by freshwater economists ( including the chicago school of economics ) and austrian school economists . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deflation#deflationary_spiral, 
  munich : * price per square meter to buy apartment in city centre 7,166.33 $ stockholm : * price per square meter to buy apartment in city centre 9,385.52 $ ... ok you won, 
  the benchmark for ecb is inflation ... which just happened to go negative , while they aim for `` close to 2 % '', 
  deflation, 
  au contraire ... there is a money demand shortage, 
   before aaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahaha, 
  euro taking wild swings against the $ : https://twitter.com/enriquediazalva/status/707934881054064641, 
  in this case you could count draghi for italy , constancio for portugal , beno\u00eet c\u0153ur\u00e9 for france , yves mersch for luxembourg and peter praet for belgium ... hooray . 
  edit : that was also actually a quote : https://twitter.com/ransquawk/status/707912569005219840, 
  there used to be a saying : * `` how could be so much month left at the end of the money . '', 
  this just turned around to : * `` what to do with all the money at the end of all days ? '', 
  germany ... as always ... 
  and just as a reminder of `` german influence '' : * as part of the ecb 's rotating voting policy , the hawkish bundesbank president jens weidmann had no say at today 's meeting *, 
  noone will give you any interest on your account . 
  life insurance is not really working anymore ( no investment yields any money at a close to zero risk ) , you can get loans for cheap and build/buy a house . 
  the german stereotype for poland is everyone steals shit . 
  in germany that is happeneing at 50 % max . 
  doesnt matter anyway - you negotiate yearly wage anyway ( at least white-collar ) . 
  whereever there 's a strong union , it 's most likely regulated . 
  * february : 900/day * march : 370/day, 
  merkel was actually opposed to junker as president ... 
  obviously .
