  but let 's see what happens now . 
  in greece and turkey deal-wise . 
  good one ;-) the russians had much more time to do that . 
  earth only has two poles ... north and south, 
  again read-up . 
  they open various `` chapters '' to evaluate the preconditions and what to do to align them with european law ... this would take turkey decades . 
  especially judicial system , seperation of powers , army , human rights ... not a chance . 
  this is conspiracy tin hat style, 
  check the process needed to become a eu member - nooness gon na `` ram '' his way through it . 
  maybe only source of blonde supermodels ? 
  war is no more a fucking option in europe !, 
  ... procrastination ... 
  shhhhh ... we keep paying some extras for your ministers - promised . 
  hey with some good-will from your side we surely could construct something similar , what do you think ?

  sure you didn #t forget the ( / s ) ? 
  otherwise this thread was all nice and fun till you turned up ... 
  this is maybe the best comment/tl ; dr since weeks . 
  ambitous morality hit wall . 
  heard a commentary last week saying `` an exchange would undermine the fact that she is completely innocent . 
  she was captured - you exchange spies , which she is n't '' and that would be the reason why ukraine hesitates to do that . 
  besides - her speeches suits ukraine better than her homecoming ... 
  earning the tenfold in quatar i would assume ... 
  so far this thread seems the best of polish-german friendship ;-) btw : you can take a dump on our gouvernment everytime you want guys . 
  on a side note that judge on the frontpage looks like he had the most miserable day in his life ... 
  we need to take down this omnious radio station , the polish did capture !, 
  always put the axe to the root !, 
  lets wait for the polish conservative trooper to comment how all this is one big conspiracy against the polish nation ... 
  this could only go south when answering . 
  either `` we do n't need twin , we stand alone '' , or `` we think of ourselves as europeans so all of them are twins ... soon ... somehow ... do n't know '' or `` austria ... but we do n't like them anymore since some weeks '' , or `` france , we love them , but do n't admire them ... while the french admire us but do n't love us ... '', 
  \u00df is just the key - not shift and \u00df yes replaced in most words , like mu\u00df = muss ( must ) .

  ... not in my backyard ... 
  what a shit show, 
  700mn are already in the pipeline .

  hint your definition of `` b\u00fcrgerlich '' is more or less `` biedermeier '' : * a `` biedermann '' is characterized as a conservative unimaginative middle-class personality , content but vulnerable to upset when disturbed by unfavorable social or economic conditions .

  living illegal in germany is probably several times better than living on asylum in greece and 100x better than sitting in a turkish desert in a tent . 
  ca n't change that - other than just completely going 1946 in germany . 
  now after having been formerly introduced you are oblieged to read his history ;-), 
  ok the dutchies start , we just take in the remaining construct . 
  do n't want to bother with belgian resistance once more ... 
  marked as `` hiding his identity - possible sleeper '' ... / s, 
  none of these are promised . 
  as of now the status of most syrians is `` temporary '' incl . 
  a reevaluation in 2 , or 5years . 
  ... citizenship takes at least 8 years . 
  this is the state of law since years btw . 
  all this talk about lottery is also illegal , because right to receive asylum is a basic human right in our , the uns and eus understanding ... 
  obviously not 100 % . 
  but anyway : there will be no benefits for people in the `` wrong '' country . 
  and there will be a deportation effort to transfer them back to cr or whereever they cam from . 
  benefits-shopping wo n't happen . 
  maybe the `` far '' past - not so the recent past ... 
  on a side note : did any refugee try to reach gibraltar ? 
  is it feasible ? 
  seems perfect way to enter the uk . 
  so to get this right : they are stuck between serbia and macedonia in no-mans land ? 
  faboulous - former fdp foreign affairs minister and head of fdp was openly gay . 
  banana !!, 
  oh absolutely - calais shows that impressivley . 
  and as a german - even if we would introduce a north korean style approach to asylum ... they would come nonetheless . 
  i would do the same - absolutely correct . 
  and germany ca n't just `` get shitty '' to deter them . 
  germany just started to introduce `` residenzpflicht '' meaning they are not only forced to stay in a country but in a defined twon/center/city . 
  150 ... thats one building ... 
  they would have to stay illegal - no benefits . 
  to be fair - she also could just get up , walk over to a policeman and claim asylum in greece ... 
  i heard a commentary this morning in german radio and they said exactly this . 
  they also said that bratislava is the 5th most prosperous region in all of europe with basically no unemployment while the rural parts feel completely forgotten ... where most right-wing voters come from . 
  as ireland obviously faces now what germany has since 30years , let me tell you some observations here : * germany has the absolut lowest margins on groceries in the whole of eu , and therefore close to the cheapest prices . 
  wal-mart got slashed over here ( for a whole lot of reasons , but also because they could not win the price war ) . 
  the german market is brutal ... and the brithplace of those two . 
  * a supplier at lidl will make close to zero margin anyway - because they can only profit because of economy of scale . 
  that 's the mantra of lidls pruchasing department . 
  not evil ... but hopeless . 
  while the men are constantley drunk the women have to do some work ... 
  relevant : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygywjtf2jya, 
  2nd that, 
  building global brands would be another one . 
  just one apple is n't enough . 
  in this case i see no problem in not minding your simplistic view of reality ... 
  sure ... who you 'd like to call in syria exactly ? 
  700/months to 700/day ... just increase speed by 100, 
  they do n't care ... they got a bit of an ocean to keep those off . 
  that would be part of the deal : ( latest draft ) : * a draft statement prepared during an eu-turkey summit listed actions that both sides could take to end the migration crisis . 
  among these , were a proposal that turkey would take back all irregular migrants from greek islands , including syrians , while the eu would then admit directly from turkey one syrian refugee for every syrian readmitted to turkey from the greek islands . 
  the eu would offer a further 3 billion euros until the end of 2018 to help turkey shelter syrians , doubling the amount of an earlier offer . 
  and it would ease visa requirements for turks wishing to visit europe 's schengen area by the end of june , earlier than had been planned . 
  the us got a relevant `` near-abroad '' they did n't turn to shit ? 
  but let 's not point out each others failures . 
  what exactly should europe do to `` clean the mess '' ? 
  boots on the ground wo n't happen . 
  bombing ? 
  ca n't see much sucess there - and is happening anway . 
  the way forward still is the conference approach - which is underway . 
  the key point is `` ship them back to turkey '' . 
  anyone read 99 francs ?
