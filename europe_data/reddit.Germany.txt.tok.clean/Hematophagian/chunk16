  after all the misery the guy went through he searched for a random grandma living in florida who held a pensionfund owning the corporations he hated most ... and killed her . 
  while germany gurantees some 30bn , france and italy still stand in for around 20 . 
  not seeing france to wave this through ... and honestly the v4 can support whatever idea they have when they start supporting it by either paying the money , or taking in refugees as decided . 
  * when adjusting for cost of living in us states , i then adjusted each state using the regional price parity numbers provided by the bureau of economic affairs . 
  * yeah well not accounting anything state-funded/tax-funded like health insurance maybe ? 
  they deport them because they have been refused . 
  accepted refugees that get refused because `` they entered from a safe state '' can not be shipped back to greece . 
  not saying this sounds rational nor logical . 
  yeah but you understand the general sentiment of `` you wrecked it , you repair it ? '', 
  the thing i really ca n't wrap my head around why the flock to an ideaology that formerly classified them as `` inferior race '' . 
  they literally degrade themselves . 
  and what 's their `` inferior race '' then ? 
  anything southern ? 
  how do they think of germans ? 
  as a master race ? 
  as a volk who deviated from the right way ? 
  aehem ... isis was founded in 2004 . 
  in a state called iraq , where at that time the us was present with a 6-figure number to my understanding . 
  the fact that `` the french took out ... '' left lybia in turmoil to this very day does not support you scenario that `` if only the europeans pulled it 's weight aka bomb the shit out of some sandn ... s '' would have made anything less worse ... 
  this brings up a good old saying : `` if your only tool is a hammer ... every issue looks like a nail '' . 
  deportation back to greece ism not possible in germany - in almost all cases . 
  conditions have been rules `` inhumane '' by the courts ... something angie ca n't change much about . 
  hint : frankfurt turned out to be 38,7 % voting participation . 
  so it 's 12 % of 38 % ... 
  leaves me wondering how those events are actually part of education in slovakia ? 
  should come over to germany for some historic lessons . 
  on a side note : is there even a `` uninhabited '' greek island that could host people ? 
  it 's either inhabited or ca n't sustain life i would guess . 
   but absolutely nothing to the effect of shutting the problem down at its source ( syria ) to be fair ... this one ist by large a problem caused by you guys . 
  the bring up to 1000 people per day from lesbos ( and other islands ) to athens/thesaloniki . 
  they got a lot of ferries down there . 
  so you are saying there is a cap already in place ? 
  the cr guaranteed ( not paid ) 1.13 % of a 7bn efsm bridge loan , which is already out of the game , and had a safety mechansim for non-euro countries . 
  in other words : zero http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/cr-only-to-guarantee-loan-within-greece-s-bailout/1237325 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/07/17-efsm-bridge-loan-greece/, 
  sure it 's good to tell a 3rd party to forgive the debt of a 2nd party ... while your own money is n't in the game . 
  i hereby declare the debt of my neighbour to his bank forgiven . 
  case closed . 
  how much of this debt exactly is guranteed by the czech rep. ? 
  well yes ... at a rate of around 80-100 / day . 
  while austria has a limit of 3.200 / day to `` wave through '' to germany . 
  imagine those numbers addtionaly refused ... 
  sooo ... refusing them at entry points ? 
  sending them back to austria ? 
  ... well i 'm not sure he really thought that one through . 
  they got their revenge, 
  to me it seems the us highly values its nato partner and his airfields ... 
  money and visa, 
  it all started yesterday with an overview of the greek navy ... completely unrelated, 
  german version : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib43gpktxjs, 
  just as i said `` some spanish were grateful '', 
  * fischer was arrested on may 14 , 1976 as a suspect in the molotov cocktail attacks on police * from left radical to foreign minister entering a war ... quite a transition . 
  probably ... i wonder why noone mentioned olof palme btw . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpun-ym1szu ( 1:03 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joschka_fischer, 
  well if you would break down a kill count , i would n't be so sure . 
  if you add all drone strikes to the `` active '' wars in lybia , syria , iraq and afghanistan you could mount to quite some high numbers i guess . 
  hey in germany we at least know daniel cohn-bendit . 
  and i always had a lil crush on segolene, 
  you got me at pompidou ;-) edit : seems the independance of algerie was the biggest event , right ? 
  i thought sch\u00e4uble was r/europes favourite pinata, 
  well i #m probably the wrong person to ask that , but i know about the friendship between him and helmut schmidt , their `` european vision '' , the oil crisis , the ussr-talks , those things . 
  well it 's always a question of `` which context '' . 
  each one played a major role in historical events of the 20th century , which were relevant for europe . 
  reunification of germany , iraq war . 
  so whenever you talk about the iraq war and europes role you will come upon fischer sooner or later . 
  if you go out on the street and ask random people : `` do you know fischer '' - 90 % say : `` no '' . 
  if you go outside and ask `` do you know german politicians of the last 50 years '' 5 % would answer `` fischer '' . 
  i know both of them giscard and pompidou . 
  ... unfortunately the munich airport is called `` franz-josef strauss '' airport ... 
  depending on your field of expertise that would be berlin most likely . 
  while leipzig is less expensive . 
  especially him ... the infamous berlin airport ( sooooooooon to open ... in 2039 or something ) will also be called `` flughafen berlin-brandenburg willy brandt '', 
  a lot . 
  besides the streets the headquarter of his party is called `` willy-brandt-haus '', 
  genscher and fischer might be a bit of a stretch , although the both had their moment in the spotlight , and therefore will be referenced : * genscher for his leading role in reunification and the speech at the hungarian embassy * fischer for standing up against rumsfeldt `` i 'm not convinced '' about weapons of mass destruction before iraq war ii , and for being the first foreign affairs minister of germany entering a war ( yugoslavia ) since 1945 . 
  politicians from europes larger countries will always win . 
  europe wo n't forget merkel , kohl , sch\u00e4uble , fischer , brandt and genscher . 
  the bismarck-class was a litlle more elegant though - purely from aesthetic point of view, 
  i do n't know what happened ... i keep getting downvoted for this opinion . 
  in 1981 germany a whole gouvernment tumbled over the decision to increase those ... : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_double-track_decision, 
  my boss would be kind of `` nervous '' at seeing the reddit-url ... this whole page is basically nsfw, 
  13/23 ... sorry to monaco , lithuania , andorra , esti , finland , etc. ... at least i got malta ... 
  nsfw ? 
  just checked ... the spanish benefits seem to be bigger than the german ones ... 
  ( beware political incorrect answer and obviously / s ) : hey the last time we send those `` able , young men '' to spain you pretty much thanked us afterwards ... at least some of you : https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombardeo_de_guernica, 
  legally speaking they can have a referendum every day if they so want . 
  but this would be complete bs . 
  again - when the referendum becomes a commonly used `` weapon '' in negotiations after an `` in '' result received - there would not be any more trust and noone would care . 
  this obviously does not refer to any future changes to the eu treaty . 
  someone disagrees : http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/cameron-dismisses-second-referendum-idea-as-complete-fiction/, 
   if the first result is `` out '' : definitley not  if the first result is `` in '' : definitley not for a long time actually it 's above, 
  audi s3, 
  as it 's a german uboat : i 'll allow it !, 
  see below, 
  travelled munich-ingolstadt ( 80km ) this morning , 7am . 
  took me 50minutes , peaked at 240km/h . 
  ... took me 15 minutes for the first 7kms though ... remember a trip irvine to la ( 60miles ? ), 
  took me 3hrs, 
  in theory ... but as soon as it appears to be a `` blackmail attempt '' each time the uk got overruled and threatens to `` have another rfeferendum '' this `` weapon '' would be pretty dull ... and the uk the laughing stock ... just as the next scottish referendum ca n't happen for a very long time . 
  could n't find a number , but i guess there are probably 300ppl working there, 
  well in 99 % of all days the possibility to `` speed '' on a freeway/highway close to la is zero ...
