  * if the first result is `` out '' : definitley not * if the first result is `` in '' : definitley not for a long time, 
  the russian embassy in berlin - where future leaders are trained ... 
   i 'd say it 's almost certain we would get better terms if ` out ' of the eu . 
  you get 1 referendum - that 's it . 
  in or out . 
  it wo n't be `` out , but we could do a second one with better terms '' - ai n't noone got time for that bullshit . 
  `` fog in channel - continent cut off '', 
  i hope they at least used german cars for that, 
  interesting additional info : the `` heinz '' - family ( yes those ketchup-guys ) originates from the same town . 
  that is something to bash the eu for, 
  `` panzerschokolade '' ( tank chocolate ) they called it back in the days, 
  i think you got that motivation wrong . 
  i would guess the tobacco industry lobbied so hard including the tobacco farmers , that they levy a tax on the competition now . 
  granted : the health aspect is irrelevant in both scenarios . 
  as most of them are stationed in germany - i would support getting rid of them . 
  noone can come up with this on his own - only bild itself . 
  i guess frankfurt disagrees with both of you ... 
  the best headline ( or must akward ) was bild : `` green politician caught with hitler drug '' ... sigh ... 
  how about not when they sabotage every european approach, 
  that a true story ? 
  i mean about the internship, 
  easy way to do it : join the euro ;-), 
  hey hitler was austrian too !, 
  yeah well ... we kind of get thrashed for it though . 
  and many allege it 's because `` workers shortage and wage pressure '' , or `` because you feel guilty for hitler '' . 
  while correct this does not solve tzhe problem that : * turkey does not take them back * greece ca n't handle all alone, 
  why would they keep the post ? 
  why not sell it or make ready for sale via an actual `` business bank '' ? 
  this law is really fishy . 
  cause and effect ... you : `` merkels policy is the cause everyone flees ! '', 
  me : `` merkels policy is the effect after everyone starting fleeing '' . 
  truth ? 
  in the middle as so often . 
  read the geneva convention , afterwards the eu human rights charta and the definition of `` refugee '' . 
  i 'm kind of fed up with the `` why give refugee a refugee status '' . 
  immigration and asylum are two completely different concepts ... although it can be argued that some immigrants try to pose as refugees . 
  but if you cant grasp the concept of sheltering people that otherwise would have a fair chance of dying i wo n't bother answering this . 
  could anyone give me an idea which kind of `` enterprises '' they could own ? 
  seems to be a foreign idea to me that they own companies . 
  insisting ? 
  really ? 
  boy ... 
  they would chant the same if the german regulations would n't accept 1 more refugee . 
  they keep chanting the same in calais while the uk says `` no chance '' and they could walk 2miles to the next refugee center and get accepted in 10 minurtes probably . 
  so why write it like this ? 
  i would assume you might help fueling / r/shitamericanssay as probably 50 % of those threads originate over here . 
  scapegoating greece by germany ? 
  i think germany is probably the one country with close to none critizism towards greece . 
  if you want to look for critics of greek border patrol go v4/austria . 
  the strongest might be the un passport i assume, 
  a lot of truth , and noone expects them to `` vanish '' or silence after the ban . 
  but what we should not accept is the fact that they receive money from the publich as a political party to express their ideas which is against the very same system . 
  kkk doesnt get public funding either . 
  correct . 
  but as he stated swissair i did not want to confuse him . 
  thx ... his, 
  the city that was shat in a valley and the last open entrance soon to be plastered with buildings after the railway is buried underground . 
  yes . 
  but announcing to have one makes plan a look weak . 
  im pretty sure she has a plan b , c and even thought about d. * b = cap influx * c = close border * d = form a small schengen/europe, 
  swissair is owned by lufthansa . 
  nope . 
  800k estimate before the infamous `` welcome speech '' vs. 1,1 mn after . 
  roughly 20 %, 
  sorry to say so ... but fdp, 
  yeah well ... kind of `` cutting off '' a part of greece as a detention center doesnt go well with people . 
  think of orban if you would propose to cut off szabolcs-szatm\u00e1r-bereg, 
  i watched the interview yesterday and thought : `` sooner or later someone will attack her '' . 
  besides von der leyen i ca n't see many others trying to . 
  too weak . 
  no chance . 
  unwilling . 
  nope kauder ? 
  never . 
  altmaier ? 
  lol . 
  who else ? 
   i could argue that the last bailout certainly excluded the will of greek people as expressed in the referendum . 
  was that european ? 
  they always had the option to walk away and declare themselves bankrupt . 
  they cant exactly do that with refugees . 
  * accelerated : yes * caused : no again pull ( incentive ) vs. push effect probably is 20 % to 80 % . 
  if you want to change the influx it 's : * stop the reasons why they flee ( besides the war in syria , improving the existing camps ) * reducing incentives ( which are already reduced ) you ca n't make germany `` unattractive '' per se . 
  and yes - you could also shut down the borders ... leading to a lot more dead ppl . 
   erdogan is an islamist . 
  you can call him many things , but i do n't think this one would be correct . 
  he values personal power and influence way higher than his religion . 
  money and commitments might do the job . 
  and then it 's not about sharing but doing the dirty work and stopping them . 
  good point about the brexit-referendum . 
  did n't realize the timing . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/studying#green also switzerland is roughly 1.4 x the costs of germany . 
  germans have a pretty good idea how quickly those things turn ugly : http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/weimar-germany/the-rise-of-the-nazi-party/ so approx 9 years at the most, 
  the uk 's economic lobby group did say more or less exactly the same ... 
  unsure if 100 rejected and 3.200 accepted are comparable ... 
  speculation : * on 7th no deal is reached . 
  greece stock-pile 30k till then . 
  * mid-march a new timetable for turkey negotiations , erdogan oversteps the mark - no deal reached . 
  * merkel agrees to caps - probably 1000/day , `` trying to seal '' the border towards austria . 
  50k pile in greece - 5000 pile in austria .
