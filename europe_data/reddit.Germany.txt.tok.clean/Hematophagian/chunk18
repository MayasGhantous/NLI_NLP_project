  everyone goes full ego-mode . 
  * june 2017 : first cdu-folks see merkels `` weakness '' and start to attack her - maybe von-der-leyen . 
  * july 2017 : greece absolutely crashes as austria has closed down the borders to only 80ppl/day . 
  so has everyone south . 
  riots in athens , golden dawn marches . 
  * some guy might come up with a last effort for a common approach ( probably dutch ) , suggesting a unified european refugee law incl . 
  restrictions . 
  poles undermine the initiative immediately . 
  tbc . 
  so what game would you like her to play ? 
  the kurz/mikl-leitner one ? 
  cap the entries ? 
  honestly - that would make a mess out of austria . 
  on the other hand it would be pretty much the same recipe for desaster that austria prescribed greece . 
  keeping up the narrative that merkel solemly caused the refugee crisis ... probably the same idea as `` i build a wall and they stop coming ... and i even make them pay the wall '' . 
  should work out well i guess . 
  puny god : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lgrarz3mq, 
  perspective ... germany still considers this an effect ... while you seem to consider it a cause . 
  bringing owls to athens ... 
  whatever the outcome or your stance are , these are inevitable facts : * resolving post-exit legal issues including trade treaties , taxation and regulatory matters might take five to 10 years , `` embroiling companies in thousands of contract revisions . 
  * * `` i think the damage for both sides in a brexit would be very big , but bigger for the u.k. as 50 percent of its trade is with the eu , '' said kerber . 
  `` that means 50 percent of the country 's exports navigate unsure waters from one day to the next . '' *, 
  he was `` prinz von oranien '' - just had to scan through all his titles for finding a dutch reference though ;-) https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/titulatur_und_wappen_der_deutschen_kaiser_nach_1873, 
  there is a slight restriction for germany ( and probably a lot of other countries ) though : - if you enter from a `` safe country '' you can be excluded from applying asylum in germany ... keyword is `` can '' !, 
  yes - restricting himself to useful stuff : http://www.denblanken.com/keizer/wilhelmhouthak.html, 
  we used to be experts - glad we forgot some know-how over the years ... http://www.greatwar.nl/frames/default-fence.html ... nonethelss expect the story of dead people in 8weeks top hitting the frontpages . 
  we as in europe ? 
  two striking examples why it 's not the `` pull '' - factor ( aka invitation ) but the `` push '' - factor that determines the numbers ( estimation is 20 % pull/80 % push ) . 
  besides that - germany would look nicer with no chance of asylum and no benefits then greece as it is ... ca n't change much there . 
  * mexicans cross the border from a 1st world state into the us where they wo n't get accepted and will stay illegal . 
  there is even a wall ... * 5000ppl sit in calais in france and want to reach the uk . 
  both examples are about desperation while they would be in a at least safe environement ... which they 'd like to leave . 
  no imagine sitting in the sands of turkey ( where less than a third are officialy `` housed '' by the unhcr ) for years , or in lybia ... you really think they would abandon their plans just because germany would say : `` no officially you are not allowed to enter '' . 
  desperation ... you 'll never understand . 
  newest number from germany : bavaria suggested a 600/day cap . 
  now its 3200 that austria passes through max . 
  hehe yeah ... realized that we again are at the point we get critized whatever we do . 
  at the end of the road where all answers ceese to exist ... it 's the threat that remains . 
  honestly : if merkel and the rest ca n't get turkey on-board on the 7th , germany will probably retreat to a national approach and decline refugees ( or cap them ) ... that #s the moment you are really fucked . 
  if she suceeds and turkey takes back some/most and stops the boats you win ... if you do n't fuck it up afterwards by `` i hate turkey '' approaches . 
  oh i know - been there 10 times . 
  but living on a southern island kind of beats that ... 
  why should anyone do it this way ? 
  `` troubles '' is as much an understatement as it is by describing the nrothireland conflict . 
  not wrong . 
  let 's put it this way : now that the problem is to big for even germany to handle it was declared a `` crisis of european proportions '' . 
  i wonder who actually came up with the dublin-law . 
  research did n't bring up a name . 
  wheelie ? 
  that 's so wrong ... but made me chuckle for a second, 
  just moved to munich ... 20 $ / sqm, 
  honestly after seeing her and listening toher she comes off as complete opportunistic . 
  is my first impression wrong ? 
  besides the sebastian `` i just finished my economics master and like to look like a total asshole '' kurz ... 
  silence !, 
  otherwise you get deported to duisburg . 
  well berlin ... had kind of a handicap for years . 
  we like it anyhow . 
  `` poor but sexy '' the former major called his city . 
  althoug i actually have a somehow pro-refugee stance i explicitly left out my opinion in this statement . 
  just to make sure everybody knwos what will happen . 
  ( which , i agree , should not solemly guide the decisions made ), 
  is n't that what i said ? 
  another voice to balance germanys voice would be rather welcomed by germany . 
  remember the `` reluctant hegemon '' description ? 
  fits quite well . 
  nowadays the only topics adressed by the uk resemble purely national interests and are focused on keeping camerons head from drowning . 
  discuss it with adolf ... ( waited years for that answer to fit in ), 
  the notion '' how do they manage while the greek fail '' came up more and more often the last days . 
  is n't it a common thing that illegal africans work on the vegetable-farms and are a more or less necessary part of the whole supply chain ? 
  no wonder the do not occur as `` refugees '', 
  more than 400 in 2016 so far, 
  physics : if pressure from outside increases the substance will concentrate ... 
   this is a fair concern , along with the dutch the uk are one of the biggest supporters of trade liberalisation in the eu . 
  and germany would welcome a balancing voice ... just not a `` i want an opt-out or i hold my breath till i drop '' - negotiations . 
  soon the first frontpage picture of a woman/boy who died hanging in barbed wire will plaster the press ... resembling some ww1 trench pricture . 
  why you ask ? 
  because in contrast to a 18yr old male who just froze to death it 's a much more powerful picture . 
  when you ask ? 
  soon - such things are inevitable . 
  how you ask ? 
  maybe because someone lost it and fired a shot , because it was cold , or just out of desperation . 
  alternatives ? 
  i ca n't see any ... 
  since some days : yes, 
  sweden is closed down , because denmark is closed down and germany is closed down for those too - piling up in austria . 
  each one a millionaire in hiding ... soon to become rich ... 
  the best part is when he tries to proove that races should not mix - because nature does not mix them too ... and then he follows up with almost 1 page explaining , meere listing how horses mate with horses , squirrels with squirrels , sparrows with sparrows ... 1 whole page ... 
  joke is on you . 
  there actually are 2parts ... 
  bizarre is the reasoning that all of it would `` somehow miracously go away '' if only germany would not take in any more refugees . 
  i will proove this in a moment . 
  first about the `` self-reflection '' : * it was wrong to accuse hungary of being `` inhumane '' for stopping refugees influx last summer * it was wrong to send a message that obviously convinced a lot of people that germany is the `` land of milk and honey '' - the fact that `` asylum germany '' used to be the number one search string in syria says so . 
  ( although noone ever said something like `` come here all welcome ) * it was wrong to assume everyone would share the belief that the eu as a whole needs to adress the crisis . 
  * it was also wrong to not discuss this belief on a broader european basis at a sooner stage . 
  * it was wrong to ignore the problem for years ... but that 's something all of europe did . 
  ... that 's about it . 
  again the idea that germany caused the refugee crisis is absurd . 
  we did n't fight in iraq , bombed lybia , drained water in africa , created isis or encircled aleppo . 
  those are the roots of this crisis , the reason why they flee .
