  the dutch have amphibic capabilities , germany has absolutely zero . 
  strawberries come at a close second, 
  may in germany : every german goes berserk over the last asparagus available . 
  riots ensured !, 
  it absolutely is : here have on lunatic fascist rumbling about it : http://www.veteranstoday.com/2011/06/05/germany-still-under-the-control-of-foreign-powers/, 
  you know that this is one of the most consistent `` tin-foil head '' - conspiracies , that is always connected to borderline fascist-movements ? 
  on a side note the so called `` occupation statue '' was the according contract from 1949-1990 and ended with reunification ( so called `` 2 +4 '' agreement ), 
   come from a country where they are in danger . 
  the vast majority come directly from germany and shout be sent directly back . 
  this is true for basically all of europe , besides italy and greece ( to some extent ... ) . 
  does not solve anything . 
  soooo ... for ever ? 
  whops ... thx for the info, 
  and here we have the main difference . 
  for most of europe but especially for germany : * `` force projection '' is not compatible with `` defensive agenda '' . 
  * for the us : `` our freedom ist protected in south chinese oceans '' . 
  when taking part in afghanistan the then ministre of defence coined the term `` germanys security is protected at the hindukush too '' this sentence did not go well with many citizens . 
  and definitley goes worse nowadays . 
   `` occupation '' germany is still under technically . 
  lol now better ? 
   few hundred euros a ~ ~ month ~ ~ day ftfy, 
  ~ ~ did n't he already say he sold his shares to his wife for 1 $ ? 
  how is this news then ? ~ ~ edit : president = / = prime minister, 
  german are already upping the budget for military . 
  8bn added till 2019 . 
  the value would be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ordoliberalism, 
  at the core probably the echr . 
  but what has it ever done for us , you might ask : https://youtu.be/ptfmay6m6aa, 
  the russia thing is not necessary . 
  many coalitions were formed over centuries . 
  thats why i wrote it . 
  sharon on the other hand said : `` either they do it , or we gon na do it '', 
  for israeli atrocities this should be added : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabra_and_shatila_massacre edit : one might add , that the killers all have been christians ... 
  what scenario does need to happen to make this come true - besides the brexit . 
  cnc-machines are like drilling machines nowadays . 
  you can buy them of the shelf . 
  in a tgv ? 
  including not mentioned in the story : - education is the best way to keep from bordeom and probably extremism - education is the best way to support rebuilding their own nation - education is the best way to have positive impact after they rebuilt their nation ( in regards to economic relationshiop to germany especially ) ... not that this all will work out , but probably still the best way to move forward . 
  and some of them might even be engineers and doctors for real , that would be beneficial for us . 
  but lyon-paris goes non-stop at 300, 
  wow - instrumentalizing a kid for political agenda ... great parenting right there !, 
  or in other words - every line leaving the country is part of the pan-european high speed rail grid : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-speed_rail_in_europe, 
  berlin is half the price of stockholm , a third of london . 
  this is complaining on a totally wrong level . 
  so ... did they hit it ? 
  about that myth i just link to this one : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/, 
  2minutes - can be done . 
  and i want elves in the app !!, 
  no wait - i want both !, 
  no - i prefer to keep blaming the austrians ;-), 
  not gon na sugar-coat it - yes that is correct . 
   they did not coordinate this with the greek government . 
  oh of course . 
  and that 's a point to be made . 
  but on the other side it also `` fell in with the argument '' not to close borders anywhere , because economics . 
  it was just convienient to blame the austrians , while at the same time being quite glad they did it . 
  everyone complained , though in most cases it could not be backed by staistics though . 
  but german supermarkets are probably the most competitive ones all over europe ( on their home turf that is ) . 
  and we have probably lower prices than all the baltics to begin with . 
  ( at least thats what i experienced last time i stayed in riga ), 
  nah - that 's an explenation `` too easy '' . 
  sure , sounds quite good - but let 's not forget how we bashed this young austrian foreign minister for doing it . 
  and for sure it was n't only greece on our minds . 
  well - at least someone admitting that this saved his ass . 
  well - leaving out the culture and the general living conditions , the us would favour the young , intelligent , well-educated , healthy people . 
  you just can have a better life as a 30-year old tech-savvy engineer in the us than in eu ( if you equate good = wealthy ) . 
  seems to be a very `` generous '' approach to contributions , or the sources just differ . 
  i took the wikipedia-article , which has it at 4.9 bn $ : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union on a side note - it 's hillarious to read through this one : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/myths/myths_en.cfm, 
   echr to f    off should they also tell the same to the un ? 
  i mean now that we are at it - why not abolish that human rights thing all together ? 
  ah . . i forgot . 
  those without constitution do seem to handle thee things more lighthearted ... 
   move the uk to the moon +1 for that one ;-) but no worries ... in june they launch their spaceship anyway, 
  since when is the uk paying 10bn net/year towards the eu ? 
  i can find 4.9 bn for uk ( and 15.5 bn for germany btw . ), 
  you do n't understand germans . 
  the guilt runs deep . 
  if poland would present a poll/official support pledge that would support german troops in poland the gouvernement incl . 
  the public gladly would send some tanks . 
  in turkey the patriot missile troops were shunned and bullied . 
  i doubt they would be welcomed to warsaw . 
  reminds me of that ba pilot that asked frankfurt tower where to land . 
  tower asks : `` your first time in frankfurt ? '', 
  ba-pilot : `` no , but last time i did n't land , just dropped the load '' . . 
  may i remind you of your national anthem ? 
  best american answer possible, 
  14 days needed . 
  after that it vanished ( half-life ~ ~ 3 confirmed ~ ~ : 8 days ), 
  op did translate . 
  ot is : `` tatverd\u00e4chtiger '' which trasnlates to alleged criminal, 
  noone is guilty before a court decides so ... and this obviously did not happen till now . 
  thx for the `` error_correction '' ;-), 
  hmmm ... * you : `` but they could have built trade barriers ! '', 
  * me : `` no they could n't '' * you : `` but it does not say they could n't '' * me : `` well yes ... treaty = no barriers '' * you : `` why is this relevant '' ... leaves me kind of confused, 
  partially wrong . 
  the main reason why the uk idea was rejected is because it treats uk citizens different then eu citizens . 
  ( which comes from the idea that uk does not have a contributionary system ) . 
  then the uk got their `` special deal '' along the brexit discussion , excempting it from this rule and suddenly any other nation follows along this line . 
  for more depth see here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4gtxtg/germany_to_block_eu_citizens_from_welfare_for_5/d2kq5b6 so what to take from that ? 
  : * contributionary welfare system i the better version * uk actually can help reform the eu sometimes,
