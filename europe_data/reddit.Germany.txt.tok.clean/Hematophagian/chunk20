  for another : as a country that holds up christian values this seems kind of hypocrit . 
  there is a clear connection from the iraq war to isis , that much is clear . 
  fun part : both statements are perfectly reasonable and probably correct ... 
  yeah i noticed that we caused the iraq war , put sanctions on iraq ( which resulted in several houndred thousands of deaths ) , disbanded the baht party , which is the main source of isis , tumbled assad , drained the syrian water supplies , bombed aleppo , destabilized somalia , mali , lybia , supported the erithrean regime , supported the cfr and their blood diamonds for money scheme , the tuarek tribes , bombed the kurds , took over mosul and probably offered free shipping to italy or greece . 
  on a side note : czech rep. was part of the `` coalition of the willing '' in iraq ... 
   once germany stops taking them they 'll stop coming altogether . 
  that is wishful thinking ... besides the estimation of `` pull '' - factor vs. `` push '' - factor the best example is calais . 
  5000 people living in a hellhole in a first-world-country just because they hope they reach the uk ... this is irrational desperation . 
  it 's completely stupid ... but it happens . 
  you think those living in turkey and lybia are n't even more desperate ? 
  to reach europe ? 
  even if the chance is minimal ? 
  polands fair share in their opinion : 0, 
  the context matters much more if you see a dead kid wrapped up in barbed wire next to a ( eg ) macedonian border patrol ... 
  lock down the borders is n't even a solution . 
  right now it would be the italian/frontex/greek patrols who either have to sink boats , let people drown or send them back to a country that rejects them ( turkey/lybia ) . 
  all of this is again illegal as of now . 
  one of the most remarkable memories in my life visiting verdun at age 16 ... it kind of sticks to you for a long time . 
  which solves close to nothing ... 
  and to # 1 our answer really is `` fuck greece '' ? 
  because one thing is for sure : they will keep comning - and even if it 's just half of it , the country would collapse . 
  the answers to any euopean approach so far : not my problem . 
  tbh i do n't care too much ... though the joke was a nice one . 
  which leads to the question what happens with the rest ? 
  well you are already out of the game . 
  the `` i want to sweden/denmark '' - people already pile up in austria . 
  100/day : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-germany-sending-hundreds-of-asylum-seekers-back-to-austria-every-day-as-mood-shifts-a6807726.html, 
  well that accusation should goes for all of the 28 eu , maybe not for italy and greece - they asked for answers since years ... 
  germany asked for a european solution ... and received national answers . 
  yeah but now they get `` streamlined '' . 
  any distribution europeanwide , any remaining dublin ii parts are shredded to pieces . 
  the german mood swings with the amount of people coming in/day . 
  and this will peak the number forcing merkel to act . 
  it goes both ways : whatever germany decides , everyone else will complain ;-) sooner or later it becomes inevitable that there is a closed border . 
  either national or mainland schengen . 
  any way the decision goes : you guys will receive the short end, 
  well he had to deny it - reason enough : http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/david-cameron-denies-lord-ashcroft-allegations-call-me-dave-dead-pig, 
  it 's a blame game - whoever goes first has the dead kid next to his border patrol on the front pages sooner then later . 
  so basically it 's `` fuck greece together '' . 
  or easier : fuck anything south of austria . 
  https://youtu.be/zpjomuue3eg?t=163 ... 
  you want a closing of the german border ? 
  that 's how you get it . 
  oh and anyone who wants to travel to any other country will pile up in austria anyway . 
  aldi and lidl battle each other based on `` discounts '' ... every week ... all the range . 
  even the biggest brands get under pressure . 
  i think cocacola wanted to fight lidl because of discounts - lidl just listed them out for months . 
  it deterres : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe, 
  being gay could still get you killed in moroc i guess . 
  uhm ... we helped create it based on the motivation to never ever fight france again . 
  commitment stays valid . 
  because it creates leverage on positions either way the music goes, 
  and polygamy ... ( brace yourself ... islam references incoming ), 
  wonder what happens if he has to retype that username though, 
  from time to time i had business contacts with lidl . 
  most of their supplier do not have one cent margin by selling to them - they only earn money by economy of scale in their supply chain . 
  besides the `` hope they close south of us '' and the `` cap '' all of these are based on official statements the in 2016 . 
  the `` unofficial '' cap is described here : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-germany-sending-hundreds-of-asylum-seekers-back-to-austria-every-day-as-mood-shifts-a6807726.html so just to remind our fellow european friends : this crisis is not happening because `` merkel invites everyone '' , it 's mostly the push - not the pull-factor causing this . 
  * restricting the flow from turkey ( basically bribe erdogan ) * stronger border patrol ( including pushing them back to turkey ) * proper registration in greece * hoping for border shut-downs somewhere `` south '' of germany ( not officially though ) * solution for syria * cap for entering germany ( already there ... more or less ) * further reduction of any benefits , right to have family reunions if all else fails...shut-down or restriction at german border, 
  merkel not even touching this topic anymore, 
  2,1 + % is stable ... 
  why is that ? 
  is n't the nhs the same thing ? 
  tax-funded not contribution-based ? 
  seems weird to me as the uk has a more `` capitalist '' attitute than the rest of europe , but operates such `` socialist '' approaches . 
  maggie ever tried to tear those down ? 
  austria ( like germany ) has no problem with the uk - but with the constant `` special treatment '' and complaining . 
  both probably want to move ahead in eu-integration - and uk is just the counter-weight to this desire . 
  just switch from a tax-based to a contribution-based system ( like any other nation ) : problem solve . 
  because i can not see any reason to let the us stay without a promise for protection ? 
  no nato no base . 
  nope ... but too many americans see themselves as such . 
  not even saying the majority ... 
  but the self-rightesnous is big in the us and the supremecy feelings follow swift . 
  edit : just read trump is at 45 % in nevada . 
  do you think that punk would even be considered to enter a party over here ? 
  i mean his motto is make america great again ... 
  not after watching 25sec of the republican debate ... 
  poland must be pissed . 
  i dont think i am part of the `` greatest nation on earth '' so my ambitions might be a little too moderate for you folks ;-), 
  born 1973, 
  oh i know that . 
  but poland was hardly the only place in this situation . 
  i specify an example for you : i can not see why the us should hold any infrastructure in germany after retrieving protection . 
  the closure especially of rammstein would cause the us a lot of problems esepcially with projecting their power further southeast . 
  ramstein is the european command hub , the largest logistics and hospital installation in europe and the central command for most of the drones flying over asia . 
  i mean russia entered the syrian war to uphold it 's influence and secure it 's med-sea port . 
  the us would loose a lot of options . 
  and frankly - things like the ttip would just be rejected right-away . 
  the spirits that i 've called ... 
  thats a weird argument ... 
  oh ... being the villian and being guilty and humble about it is quite a comfortable place to be too . 
  the argument can be made that this violates the equality before the law . 
  a cornerstone of democracy . 
  oh she can turn on the spot ... proven several times . 
  as she lacks any `` visionary '' future scenario , she is always capable of taking the right direction . 
  not sure if this would work here - but still, 
  it 's an easy deal : influence for protection . 
  if you retrieve the protection , the influence goes down the drain . 
  that 's how `` empires '' work in the 21st centruy .
