  if you decide for booze instead of insurance ... 
  there is no `` abusing '' of an `` unconditional '' income ... 
  there is however the question what would happen if people run out of money mid-month , spending all on hoockers and blow and suddenly there is no more safety net left ... would they let them rot on the streets ? 
  something 's wrong with that numbers ... i would assume that [ rammstein ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramstein_air_base ) alone costs probably 250mn $ to operate . 
  it 's the european command center , airfield , drone programm , hospital , logistics centre , nuclear depository , and who knows what kind of surveillance tec . 
  maybe many of these things count towards cia or nsa-budget though ;-), 
  that is actually not true . 
  when the government spends 50bn it will return via taxes to them - probably at least half of it - one way or the other ... 
  this wo n't stop . 
  it wo n't stop when : * germany is closing its borders * slovenia is closing it 's borders * turkey gets a 3bn deal to stop it * greece deport anyone back to turkey * frontex starts sinking boats * uk leaves eu any proposals out there that have at least a minimum of decency left ? 
  you are welcome to dig through thousands of wars fought by hundreds of states then . 
  probably to find out that kurhessen fought the most fights against nassau ... 
  i know i know ... germans are terrible ... they destroy anyone by money . 
  and they destroy schengen even before you could join . 
  btw - our doctors go to switzerland , the nurses to norway ... 
  seems a perfect moment to `` restaff '' from the bottom of worlds population . 
  why not try syrian doctors ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage 8 countries ahead of germany ... oh and again this `` gibs money to us - not refugees '' is again as much disgusting as completely unprobable, 
  missing out on 40bn the next 5 years ... 
  i do n't think it 's the benefits - those are mimized as you speak . 
  it 's just the hope of a succesful future - which favours the prospering countries ... 
  `` germany is keeping us poor '' is your personal agenda , right ? 
  nice thinking ... and despite your username i answer : what you describe is more or less a trading union ... which would also contradict the purpose of any `` redistribution '' . 
  basically you could stop all transfer payments immediately . 
  opinion ? 
  none . 
  the word `` german '' was referenced in so many ways . 
  especially the `` deutsche orden '' is some obscure construct , which owned at some point of history large amounts of land , even a country ( which is what you are refering to ) . 
  i mean they owned a large part of lebanon and syria ... which has not much to do with `` germany '' in any way . 
  thei official name was ( btw ) : order of brothers of the german house of saint mary in jerusalem . 
  i do n't think there is any other `` clever '' way to count the hundreds of wars fought by , or on the ground , of former german states , duchesses , counts and down to single cities against each other , against other countries or whatever . 
  you would have to think about times , when the `` german state '' meant owning the crown of the `` holy roman empire '' like charlesmagne or otto the great , the bavarian kingdom alone has plenty of wars on it 's scoreboard . 
  on a more serious side-note : would any of these regions hypothetically find a legal way to join ? 
  ca n't find any way to leave the german territory ( ... although we used to have the `` whoever wants to join , is welcome '' part for the gdr ), 
  we know , we know ;-), 
  basically ... because hte comment were on brink of becoming / r/european, 
  it probably took more and more people just to monitor and moderate the chargeable filth out of it . 
  germany : since 1871 it should be france in the lead . 
  before there was no germany - and we fought pretty much ourselves constantley, 
   in many ways it makes things easier because muslims holding dual citizenship are most likely to be disloyal or dangerous . 
  ignoring the bullshit hatred you spit out - you realize the turks are mostly also muslims ? 
  so your sentence does not even have any logic ? 
  uhoh ... reichstag burning ? 
  thats why 5cm snow in london equals armageddon ... ;-), 
  who around here still got summer tires on their car ? 
  i think we are still below the threshold of `` ca n't integrate the numbers '', 
  i 'm a german - even i had a laugh, 
  some are included - some are not ( those with undecided status ), 
  wait till they figure out he 's s german too ... 
  nope, 
  and then what ?

   russia is second only to the us in military power . 
  china might have a word there, 
  said nerone ever ... 
  i mean you can say what you want - but juncker insisted on the correct way to do it ( obviously not for long though ) . 
  the eu does tradeagreements and they are voted on by the democratically elected eu parliament ... 
  you can reach this goal by practising ( and doing yoga ... lots of ) . 
  and yes - you will find proof if your google or search reddit ...

  that 's why the brexit gets `` harder '' by the minute ...

  major questions of our times ... 
  thank you for your service ... 
  honestly : i ca n't see a scenario in which one of the 4 freedoms is basically `` sold '' for money without the others ... even if the uk would pay 700mn/month . 
  does not make sense ... even if her majestys government opts for this kind of scenario . 
   drop by 10-20 % or so even if - the numbers of minis would rise ... good for bmw either way . 
  he should talking to putin - the referndum idea is not how you do it ... 
  and here we do have a prime example of this species : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-nebervro0, 
  depends . 
  you are definitely right , but a euro invested in munich earns you just more than in romania . 
  long term goals excluded ... 
  lets upvote it !, 
  what happened there ? 
  you must know about those ... as the uk not bothered to be part of it back then , pushed the agenda of eastern expansion soon after joining years later and open its labour market far earlier then everyone else . 
  damn foreigners ? 
  the south korea trade agreement to some extend . 
  main reason why it took 6 years or so . 
  none of the rest and neither ceta nor ttip, 
  + none of those agreements include services or passporting, 
  brexiter : they surely must have those exact same fears on the otherside of the channel ? 
  we 're fine . 
  wish you luck !, 
  no bird is allowed to fly over syria without russian consent . 
  some truths ( about freedom of service ) that are also unconvienient for europeans . 
  but * so much for the freedoms of capital and services . 
  nor has the free movement of people been strictly upheld . 
  france and germany - unlike britain - blocked access to their labour markets and welfare systems for east europeans for seven years after they joined the eu in 2004 . 
  it was a political decision . 
  * is bullshit ... uk was free to do the same . 
  saxony ... stop embarassing germany ... !!, 
  im even sorry for those who wanted it ... but didnt see the consequences, 
  so `` buy english '' it is ? 
  the pound and the fury brexit is making britons poorer , and meaner oct 11th 2016 , 13:29 by r.a. | washington timekeeper these are exciting times for britain 's currency , and not in a good way . 
  on the eve of the vote on whether to leave the european union , back in june , a pound bought you $ 1.48 . 
  sterling has since declined by more than 16 % against the dollar , to $ 1.22 . 
  nearly half of the drop has occurred in the last week or so , as the conservative government has outlined plans for a `` hard '' brexit : one which shoves britain right out of the single market in exchange for the ability to do more harm to itself by reducing migration .
