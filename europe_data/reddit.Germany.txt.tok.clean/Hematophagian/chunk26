  ... sending farage to brussels and lecturing about humour ... 
  bayer owns a vast and extended gmo business . 
  they neither acquiered monsanto `` to move elsewhere '' nor did the eu stop them to sell their gmos `` all over the world '' . 
  so your statement is plain bullshit . 
  ridiculous ... http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/%22big_6%22_pesticide_and_gmo_corporations, 
  they did already lobby their asses off in brussels - not a chance . 
  bayer itself had quite an extended gmo program . 
  they are not the innocent . 
  it 's mostly about adding markets to their portfolio and strengthening some areas . 
  +1 for the thumbnail, 
  to push the center roughly 300km southwest you need a quite big country . 
  it has to outweight everything northeast from aschaffenburg - which goes 2000miles landmass up to riga . 
  south west . 
  so i would suggest chile ? 
  should do it, 
   ( it was a pretty predicatble outcome though ) was it ? 
  i was born in a town in south-west germany . 
  blackforest . 
  afd took the direct mandate . 
  below 10 % is a suprise to me . 
   cool scottish girls google it ... sluts ... http://hubpages.com/travel/thejockspot_10_scottish_jokes_and_proverbs, 
  oh - did n't get the insight . 
  did boris refer to jokers being all around after brexit some time ago ? 
  more like a pair of 2s and some additional odd number cards . 
  a mature brit ... rare sight, 
  to counterbalance the effects of free movement of products and services . 
   those people knew exactly what they were doing . 
  oh - no doubt about that . 
  but in the case of a second `` asylum pledge '' they can be deported to greece if the humanitarian conditions are sufficent ( which have been deemed no to be by german courts so far ) . 
  many already asked for asylum in greece and havent been send back anyway . 
   as far as the uk border agency would be concerned , france is the point of origin of the migrants and they would be within their rights to return them to france . 
  sure ... after they crossed the channel and asked for asylum on british soil ... 
  i mean the whole thing is a clusterfuck - but there is not much sense in forcing a country to stop people from leaving it . 
   getting blood out of a stone . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  the fucking ecb started to buy corporate debt now ... they soon run out of stuff to buy !, 
   business will keep more of their profits and invest it in people and other business totally ... as can be seen now - at a time when investments are basically for free at a close to 0 % interest rate ... 
   already to rescue deutsche bank ... a mere 6bn ... 
  deutsche going down would be as catastrophic as lehmann going down - so yes , you are right - noone can let it go down . 
  ( besides my money is there ... ) but before deutsche is finally going under , it definitley would be bought out by a competitor ( because : surprise surprise - the us banking sector doing quite good - not like 2007/8 ) , or several others go down first ( which would already make a catastrophic scenario ) . 
  edit : i also assume that rescuing deutsche might still be cheaper than rescuing greece ;-), 
  the moment a german default happens ... money is your least problem ... 
  passporting to wales ... 
  fog over channel - continent cut off ... 
  but it `` feels '' like more ... just as feel trumps facts ... : http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-john-oliver-republican-convention-trump-20160725-snap-story.html, 
  https://twitter.com/humenm/status/757482109342773248  25-jul-2016 08:43:46 - london 's golders green underground train station evacuated due to security alert - london transport spokesman ... depends, 
  honest question : those asos jobs are minimum wage i guess ... how could anyone drive them lower ? 
  why would anyone pay more for unskilled labour ? 
  berlins rents are the cheapest rents in any western european capital . 
  and it ranks 6 or 7 in germany ... 
  do n't feel special ... the us supported anyone who could say the 3-word sentence `` communism is bad '' . 
  from sadam hussein to pinochet . 
  london is 20 % of uk gdp ... banking is half of that . 
  loosing passporting would cost a quarter of banking gdp ?!, 
  probably ? 
  that would come to 2,5-3 % of uk gdp ... which would obviously hurt . 
  absolutely correct : * portugal was a dictatorship 1949 * greece became one after joining and there is not one single punishing mechanism in nato_contracts for such `` feable things '' as being a dictatorship ... ... aka back in the days when politics meant kissinger-style realpolitik, 
   which will strengthen its negotiating position on this exit . 
  this `` war-like '' rhetoric makes the rest hope for situations that force a little bit more humbleness on the island ... 
  women ... usually more reasonable than the bojo-like apes, 
  what the hell is happening in this thread ? 
  did sas and thedonald have had a school excursion ? 
  unbelievable , , ,, 
  being actually at war with isis ( aka having troops near/over syria/iraq/lybia ) seems to be an additional prerequisite ... and none v$ country has those as far as i know ... 
   you were the only bite i got damit ... just desperately needed a distraction from work . 
  berlin ? 
  europe ? 
  merkel ? 
  eu council ? 
  see the difference ? 
   best british fashion machiavelli-style like the tories ? 
  or as orderly as the labour party ? 
  from people jumping from `` because vw '' to `` france always guilty '' in 2 posts and 5minutes ... the insights are overwhelming, 
  so ... no need for visas anymore ? 
  just asking for a friend ... 
  it 's `` informal '' ... so still legal, 
  as a german : boy what a load of bullshit these comments are ... both sides salty as fuck . 
   the internet of words typo right there ;-) yes you are right : the internet of things is one of the next `` big things '' . 
  and yes they need cpus . 
  google produces their own , some are infinion , or arm , or qualcomm . 
  any way - noone needs softbank - the official mixed grocery store of `` things with tech '' - holding from the 90s . 
  https://twitter.com/leslieshaffer1/status/755266705274773504  deutsche bank : cuts #softbank to hold , target to y6500 ; arm `` excellently positioned '' but fail to see synergies , price too rich $ 9984 . t https://twitter.com/peter_tl/status/754972661445304320  masayoshi son press conference jargon bingo : `` internet of things '' `` paradigm shift '' `` ecosystem '', 
  trade-agreements are done by the council ... end of story . 
  so yes : if you would push it hard - that 's breaching the eu-contract . 
  \u00b4 the question is : where does inofficial become official . 
  brussels knows the game - they are professionals . 
  so they are porbably aware of 2 facts : * the smoother the uk transfers out of the union - the better for all ... so let them `` talk '' . 
  * it is quite unprobable that any 3rd party would agree to an agreement with the uk before knwoing how the uks relationship with the eu is ... and that takes at least 2 years . 
  they could do that on their own . 
  what synergy ? 
  david davis might have been great in the 90s and might still be respected . 
  all i read from him on his website about brexit negotiations is delusional , naive and as fucking arrogant as it could get . 
  that guy is far worse than bojo . 
  thx for `` screwing things up `` ... ppl like you are the reason the rest of europe wants to get rid of the uk ... fast . 
  its because there is just no good business case in this merger . 
  nothing that would ad value . 
  i linked it around a month ago . 
  check my history . 
  im on mobile . 
  there is another option about breaching contract deriving from the vienna convention ... but it is a little theoretical .
