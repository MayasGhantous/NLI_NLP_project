  ** one in ten ( 10 % ) think most eu citizens will be required to leave the country ** that number is already extremely high ... 
   whisky yep - good example . 
  let 's see what mr. 
  frost from the scotch-whisky association has to say :  for the scotch whisky industry , the big gain of being part of the european union is the single market and the eu 's single trade policy . 
   he kind of issues we face are high tariffs , for example the 150 % tariff in india , other discriminatory excise duties and taxes , restrictions on certification of imports , complex and constantly changing labelling rules , or rules on licensing which restricts access to the market . 
  trade deals are totally en-vogue . 
  everyone wants one ... even with the uk . 
  ... after you left the eu ... at the end of the queue, 
  the eurokorps did that 1994 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0qlmtlcwy bonus : german tank on champs elysee, 
  https://twitter.com/comrespolls/status/753505839068114944  half of britons ( 52 % ) say they think that the uk will stay in the single market with some limits on freedom of movement . 
  wishful thinking ... on a side note :  more britons ( 53 % ) think it is likely that the uk will no longer exist in ten years ' time than think england can win a major football tournament ( 13 % ) . 
  around a quarter of britons ( 25 % ) think it is likely that the uk will be a member of the eu is ten years ' time . 
  best comment :  52 % want a custom unicorn . 
  i also want a custom unicorn , one that teleports through shadows . 
  i know ... http://shanghaiist.com/2016/06/24/china_brexit_response.php ... you might come up with some sources for that ... 
  and so it happens ... the discussions stay the same - the conflicts get regional ... ... now it 's the pesky welshman replacing that polish guy getting to many benefits ... next step : city against city ... you are one step away from a tribal society fighting against each other . 
  village-warlord against sheriff ;-), 
  breach of contract - could lead to expulsion ( also : article 60.2 of the vienna convention ) although i think a lot would have to happen before measures as stark as these come in effect . 
  there was a whole tread the other day : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4st779/can_the_eu_stop_the_uk_holding_informal/?st=iqniydoa&amp;sh=b2d935f1 on a side note : it has been said several times : the major question the other parties will ask : `` what will your relationship with the eu be ? '', 
  and as the uk can not answer that one - there will probably be no trade agreements at all ... besides maybe some very desperate countries ... ( liberia ? 
  maybe ... ), 
  nice work done here !, 
  thanks !, 
  hear hear !!, 
  noone has any experience in the situation of one poster trying to keep it going, 
  the sphinx has spoken ... it is as reasonable as free movement of people ... 
   the independent is full of shit . 
  at least it obviously has an agenda and likes to distort the story . 
  he clearly never had the idea to make deals with 28 countries ... on the other hand he also is clearly completely naive if he thinks he could just ring merkel to make a eu deal - because `` muh cars '' . 
  circle ... jerk ... 
  jeesus ... there are so many of them ?!?? 
  where do they all come from ? 
  cornwall ? 
   idiot yeah but the ignorant idiot would not be aware there is such a thing as galeries lafayette ... because it does not exist in his bubble . 
  i mean to be fair : where outside france does galerieslafayette even exist ? 
  why ? 
  for that one they could start immediately . 
  rated as the best tl ; dr in the whole thread ... !, 
   is de-facto unsolvable even better - the eu can finally develop several things the uk used to veto : http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-14/an-post-brexit-opportunity-europe-shouldn-t-miss, 
   start his iconic department store he went overboard with this one ... which actually is quite creative ... and also shows much more knowledge than he admits . 
  so yes : i 'll go with satire ... and not even bad one . 
   the uk will be looking for a trade deal , something closer to the kind of relationship the eu has with other major economies outside of the eu/eea . 
  this would be the blueprint then : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/south-korea/ problems : * will cost half the banker jobs in the city * will take definitley longer then 2 years to finalize, 
   surely an agreement with the eu and britain , as with tariffs , can be reached in this regard . 
   it wont . 
  the most extensive ftas exclude services . 
  the eu want regulations on the banking sector , the uk did veto time after time . 
  and you just do n't let unregulated services into your country . 
  you can make the example `` less dramatic '' - think of an israeli bank operating in the us - without having been registered at the sec , or having an office in nyc . 
  not gon na happen . 
  this will be my last effort in enlightening you ... for a greater good :  the noises coming out of the german government were certainly interpreted so , when the german ministry announced that the dublin procedures were not longer being enforced for example . 
  dublin was declared dead by the ecj ... not germany . 
  this is also not an invitation . 
  for a full discussion go there : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?st=iqmebq0m&amp;sh=da65186d * 1,3 m. 
  as i said - it 's not millions !, 
  that would be  2mn ... * but they somehow seemed to be migrating through europe in freedom ? 
  that 's schengen - and has absolutely nothing to do with the single market ... for the uk this is also absolutely irrelevant ... as they are not part of schengen ... and the francais are such a nice people stopping anybody at calais ( ... for now ), 
  for refernces : http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/heres-a-map-of-all-the-countries-with-a-buffoon-for-a-foreign-secretary--zyepgpyjpsw, 
  done deal ... let 's sum it up then : * 60 % of london city bank jobs just moved to frankfurt * to export anything to the eu you need to abide to all regulations the eu implements ... no influence on that one . 
  so basically you can not change much regulations yourself , or you need to produce `` 2 versions '' . 
  ( this includes the banana , the cucumber , the light bulb and the vacuum cleaner ) * those 1.5 mio brits in mainland europe need to have a residence permit ... or leave ... probably, 
  question is when will `` informal '' cross the line to `` formal '' . 
  obviously the uk can not have any formal trade talks - cause that would violate the eu treaty . 
  trade talks are the job of the eu council . 
  and as long as the uk did not exit ( most likely art50 + 2years ) they are bound to the eu rules . 
  on a side note : it has been said several times : the major question the other parties will ask : `` what will your relationship with the eu be ? '', 
  and as the uk can not answer that one - there will probably be no trade agreements at all ... besides maybe some very desperate countries ... ( liberia ? 
  maybe ... ), 
   they are the main part of an agreement for an explanation i would recommend this : https://youtu.be/ustypbked8y?t=956  the barriers to passporting of banking sector seems to be over-regulation from brussels that is not what is happening . 
  it offers the right to supply a service in one of 31 countries that will automatically be available in all the others . 
  this is absolutely unique . 
  so i break it down to your country of origin : to leave london the passport rights after an exit from the single market , would be like having the bank melli ( teheran ) offering its services in telaviv without regulation by the state of israel ... ... noone does this ... 
  * there was no invitation * it 's not millions * they are not part of freedom of movement * they are not citizens of the eu * the concept of freedom of goods and services needs the freedom of movement to balance it * and about the concessions : there were plenty - incl . 
  restrictions of benefits, 
  tariffs are the easy part - no need for those . 
  regulations are the much harder one . 
  easiest example is passporting of banking sector : you have your hq as a bank in london - voila full access to 31 nations . 
   complaint warrior hahaha - i like this new job descritpion . 
  oh what wonders is the eu going to suprise us with in the future ? 
  including the almost total lack of regulations in singapore ... tax fraud ? 
  why should i care ... 
   subject to further costs and regulation one for 31 ... uk will be 1 for 1, 
   laws of the sea does it have trial by combat ? 
   ( 2/5 ) the eu is very slow on trade deals . 
  took eu 6 years to reach deal with singapore , usa just 2 . 
  s korea deal took eu 3 years , us just 1 mr davis , the brexit secretary thinks he can be much faster ... somehow ... : https://twitter.com/daviddavismp/status/740159086667411456, 
   well when germany invites several million migrants/refugees and then distributes them across europe you can understand why people are a bit sketchy about freedom of movement , this is so blatantly wrong on so many levels ... 
  thanks for this well-phrased and balanced commentary .

  in this case there is nothing to fear outside the common market , right ? 
   some paid , some influenced , some belivers . 
   finance is global . 
  it 's not . 
  you have to abide to the rules & regulations of the country you offer your services . 
  you wan na sell life-insurance ? 
  good - offer the gurantees regulated in the country . 
  ok - get one in the country you operate . 
  that is and was true for all major economies ... the eu , the us and china .
