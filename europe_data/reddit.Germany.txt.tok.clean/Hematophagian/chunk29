  now the major advantage was : `` come to london - and fulfill the regulations of 31 countries '' . 
  this will be gone now . 
  oh right ... well - there will always be the one guy telling us `` that 's a good thing '' . 
  some paid , some influenced , some belivers . 
  i saw several different opinions on that - two of them ( which i found very interesting ) : * `` foreign secretary - after taking away trade and brexit - it 's basically just an entertainment show - so we took the best entertainer for the job '' * `` you broke it - you help fix it now . 
  if you fail ... it 's just you - not me ( may ) , who said it would be difficult all along '', 
   mutual recognition as you said - which would be absolutely stupid . 
  why should 480mn ppl follow the regulatory changes of the uk right-wing gouvernment about environmental standards eg . 
  * uk : `` yay we tories learned to love gmo crops '' * eu : `` oh ... ok ?! '', 
  * uk : `` yes and we gon na export it to you ... and there is nothing you can do against it !! '', 
  * evil grin * ... so not happening, 
   close too full access to the financial service markets that is also what is not going to happen - based on a free trade agreement . 
  south korea would be the most advanced fta with europe ... it excludes services . 
   do you want eu consumers to be able to benefit from financial services offered by uk based banks ? 
  that must be the most supid propaganda sentence i ever read . 
  lo and behold the wonders of the uk banking sector _ at your fingertip . 
  thats like saying `` you need access to the wonderful bella machina of mercedes and therefore ... '' the banking sector can access the market whenever they want ... they just enter one country of the single market and surprise they can access all of them without founding new branches or follow national regulations ... ... there is absolutely no reason why this would be valid for a country outside the single market ... with it 's own regulations ... not the subject of any control mechansim of the single market ... 
  nice fun fact : he just went to the european court of justice to abolsih dripa - the surveillance package supported by mrs. may ... http://www.daviddavismp.com/david-davis-comments-on-his-european-court-of-justice-case-against-dripa/, 
   `` i would like to see us negotiating access to the single market for britain 's businesses , so we can go on selling our goods and services into the european union market and indeed enjoying the benefits of consuming european union goods and services here as we do now . '', 
  so this is going towards a `` ceta '' - approach . 
  a freetrade agreement abolishing tariffs . 
  also abolishing free movement of people and ( * drumroll * ) passporting rights for the banks . 
  ( anything else would be delusional ) . 
  jpmorgans response to david davis btw : https://twitter.com/humenm/status/753508595342409728/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw  a pre-requirement to deciding where to position uk on a trade-off between free movement of labour and single market access is a recognition that such a trade-off actually exists . 
  the uks cheif negotiator has apparently not reached this stage yet '', 
  no it does not - the more `` angry man '' demanding `` a `` good deal '' '' the worse for all of us ... 
  on a side note : the automobil-industry is about 2.7 % of german gdp . 
  the city of london is about 20 % of uks gdp . 
  so if anyone wants to be that stupid and play the `` chicken game '' ... this will end in an economic catastrophe ... for the uk first and foremost . 
   i think that it wo n't arrive at all . 
  maybe for the cac40, 
  i just drop this one here too : http://www.daviddavismp.com/david-davis-gives-a-speech-making-the-case-for-brexit/  free trade with britain is in all their interests . 
  this is particularly true of the most powerful leader in europe , angela merkel . 
  her economy is dependent on exports , particularly of manufacturers , and especially of cars . 
  britain is the second largest and fastest growing car market in europe . 
  audi , bmw , mercedes , and volkswagen alone are over 25 % of the british market , with the uk buying one million cars from germany every year . 
  they can not afford the threat being levelled at britain , so called `` wto terms '' , because they would involve a 10 % levy on all car imports . 
  ** a german chancellor would have to avoid this , particularly in an election year . 
  in europe , what a german chancellor wants , a german chancellor generally gets . 
  indeed the first calling point of the uk 's negotiator in the time immediately after brexit will not be brussels , it will be berlin , to strike the deal : absolute access for german cars and industrial goods , in exchange for a sensible deal on everything else . 
  ** similar deals would be reached with other key eu nations . 
  france would want to protect the # 3bn of food and wine it exports to the uk . 
  we have seen the sort of political pressure french farmers are willing to bring to bear when their livelihoods are threatened , and france will also be holding a general election in 2017 . 
  italy will deal to protect its billion-pound fashion exports . 
  and poland its multi-billion pound manufacturing and electronics exports . 
  so there is almost certainly going to be a deal , one that maintains a free market between the eu and the uk . 
  it is the arrogance and the fact that they just do not get it . 
  you can talk to merkel a long time - and probably she sets the agenda about a lot of things ... but this ? 
  you do not go to berlin to `` visit the queen of europe '' and ignore the rest ... thats not how it works ...

  brexit gets its own ministry though . 
  david davis will lead those negotiations ... not that much better, 
  the brexit-negotiator guy ... is even worse : read his twitter acc . 
  from before the vote : https://twitter.com/daviddavismp?lang=de, 
   right now anyone from a country that pays shit money can leave their country and move to any country in the european union . 
  where exactly would be the problem then ? 
   and do n't need freedom of movement . 
  so then also just restrict the insurance the uk bank is selling there . 
  you see : it 's just like saying : `` nah you ca n't move to london from cornwall ... but you can buy theat insurance anytime '' . 
  that 's not how it works . 
   leech ca n't see anyone leeching, 
  in usd !!!, 
  : http://www.ftse.com/products/indices/uk down 8 %, 
   our markets are at the highest in 10 months that would be the ftse-100 , of which 70 % of the revenue is made outside the uk and in $ . 
  it is a mechnical effect : the pound goes down : the company valued in pound , making revenue in $ goes up . 
  look on the ftse-250 ( mostly uk-based companies ) in $ ( not effected by currency ) : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/27/why-we-should-be-looking-at-the-ftse-250-and-not-the-ftse-100-to/, 
  that 's so european ... 
  there are several options :  it is worth noting , though , that the uk could be thrown out of the eu by the other member states under article 60.2 of the vienna convention if it was guilty of a `` material breach '' of its treaty obligations -- which , it 's important to realise , will apply after article 50 notification right up to the moment the uk actually withdraws . 
  the relevant parts of article 60 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) read : a material breach of a multilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles : ( a ) the other parties by unanimous agreement to suspend the operation of the treaty in whole or in part or to terminate it either : ( i ) in the relations between themselves and the defaulting state , or ( ii ) as between all the parties ; ... a material breach of a treaty , for the purposes of this article , consists in : ( a ) a repudiation of the treaty not sanctioned by the present convention ; or ( b ) the violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of the treaty . 
  the european union law ( emergency provisions ) bill promised by vote leave even before the uk negotiated its withdrawal might well constitute a material breach , given that it 'd mean refusing to recognise the jurisdiction of the european court of justice . 
  being thrown out would n't be very attractive , as it 'd mean there 'd be no agreement for instance about the protection of the rights of british companies and citizens elsewhere in the eu . 
   we 'll all be happier with some momentum rather than the current storm of nonsense !, 
   absolutely agreed, 
   why is the european union so adamant on freedom of movement ? 
  because it balances the other freedoms and is the basic framework to let a single market allow to work - exterminating all restrictions . 
  one should mention that this was not intended to work from the start - therefore after the east european extension that right was delayed ... except the uk did not want to delay it ...  all it does is allows the migrants and the undesirables germany takes in and gives citizenship to this comment is just basically stupid . 
  for once the immigration from outside eu to the uk is quite larger than the eu -  uk immigration : so your `` brown people taking ma jobs '' come from pakistan ... for a second one : free movement is for citizens . 
  asylum seeker/refugees are allowed to seek citizenship in germany after 8 years of legally staying here . 
  we assume the syrian conflict should be resolved before and many of them will return home . 
  basically this was a very nice xenophobic cunt-like comment  the eu should 've had freedom of movement for skilled workers , and that 's it . 
  several studies especially on the topic of eu-uk immigration show exactly that : the immigrants are mostly skilled workers , receive far less benefits then the average uk citizen and are largely net-positive as economic effects . 
  on top of that was one of the results of camerons special snow-flake negotiations before the vote exactly aimed at that : denying benefits to eu immigrants for 3 years . 
   as per usual not a single person can reply with a response about how the system is fair . 
  this sub is so eu fanatic it 's crazy . 
  on a side note : funny that you did edit this part and the whole post after i answered ;-), 
   https://twitter.com/quantian1/status/749675831719518208 it really is that easy ...
