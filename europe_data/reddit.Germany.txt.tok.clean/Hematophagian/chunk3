  trade treaty = no way to impose import barriers, 
  they signed a free trade treaty ... and even without : they could not withstand pressure . 
  have a try ... we gon na watch . 
  ... all that this makes me think of is `` whole talk is domestic policy of us '' . 
  the us president scrapping ramstein would get a medal from german public ... and an absolute shit-show from your military . 
   german military would be rolled over by a russian invasion that was the idea ... i said `` stall '' not `` stop '' . 
  actually the idea was to makle germany a nuclear warfield with short-range tactical nukes if anything else fails ... 
  here is the key scenario for us army deployed in germany - and also the german army : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fulda_gap, 
  force projection to all of asia , africa and arabia ... https://theintercept.com/2015/04/17/ramstein/, 
   like germany certainly are n't the whole german army had only one purpose : stall a russian invasion . 
  as this argument fall more and more flat the army was downsized and restructured . 
  now we have this `` go bomb syria '' - demands coming in for a purely defensive army , which also does not even have too many reasons to `` wage war '' inside the legal framework . 
   free ride hurr durr murica best army . 
  ca n't see the need of projecting power to defend the nation ... 
  i do not think our nation is defended in asia or arabia ... 
   i am from a different continent that was kind of obvious ;-) usually us-boys turn up with that `` eruope ? 
  isn #t that all the same country ? '' - attitude . 
  as you are not a us-boy let meput it this way : you need to look for these websites depending on the country you wan na buy the car - not the `` mainland europe '' thing . 
  as we have several languages this might get complicated . 
  the vauxhall astra is the same as the opel astra ( mostly ) on `` mainland europe '' . 
  `` review sites are not that common - and are different in each country . 
  again for germany there is the so called `` pannenstatistik '' - which shows how many cars did break down each year ( slightly flawed though ) : https://www.adac.de/infotestrat/unfall-schaeden-und-panne/pannenstatistik/, 
  it is not . 
  the word '' mainland europe '' shows a lack of understanding . 
  mobile.de would be the german equivelent . 
   it would be nice to know the name of this little shit . 
  why ? 
  german authorities never publish names of non-convited suspects . 
  as almost no country does ( ... besides the us ), 
   they 're free to impose import barriers actually they are not http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/16/kenya-flower-trade-eu-pressure, 
  dobrindt of all people ... 
  and you know what makes me even more angry ? 
  i tend to fall for the same stupid easy fallacy whenever i see a eastern european flair connected to those bigots . 
  now i see poland less reasonable again . 
   ( which obviously apply only to other people , not european ) so your human rights have been violated ? 
   ( well germany 's ) bad priorities those are ? 
  the southeners will be grateful ... 
  simple minds looking for simple answers . 
  you of all people should n't be surprised by this . 
  after all your crusade to discuss ttip objectivley ended in 90 % shouting-matches all over reddit . 
  its just the story of a countrys default and the misery coming from it . 
  * the internet users behind the doxing campaign say their motivation is moral outrage , claiming that women in the sex industry are `` corrupt and deceptive . '' ( tellingly , dvach users also complained that such women typically ignore the kind of men who make up dvach 's audience . 
  sounds valid - have 1 iq-point up, 
  bringing up the question , how clever as a full ashtray ? 
   varoufakis say said a lot of things this guy ... debt relief means to convince all of them . 
  sure - you wo n't achieve this by not convincing good old rolling chair , but neither would you achieve this by not convincing mdm . 
  lagarde . 
  is it really relevant though ? 
  default is default . 
  sure - you 'll ruin more if you drag it on for longer . 
  but theres not much difference between defaulting on 100bn or 300bn . 
  in no possible outcome can they get new loans in the following 10 years - in no possible outcome can they get rid of the vultures trying to get money by lawsuits . 
  uh yes ... around 18 % as far as i remember ... sure - when germany would just forget it 's part that would work i guess ... 
   germany interfering the summit was called of by dijsselbloem , the open issues come from imf ... where exactly is it germany ? 
  and that is exactly your problem - including the fact that i am sick of this line of argument . 
  this sentiment will sooner or later trigger those `` western '' countries to leave you behind on the way forward ... 
  the eu parliament , the members of the eu council ? 
  and they did decide the eu president and the members of council . 
  so ... basically everyone, 
  good question . 
  i do n't think the brexit alone can throw the eu over the cliff ... but the centrifugal forces are already high nowadays . 
   you westerners it 's the eu - not some `` foreign western power '' . 
  you are the eu too ... 
  soon ... ... 
  no , more like without eu your constitution ( + court ) would already be on the `` landfill of history '', 
  i think it 's more like `` brexit could crash the eu - and the eu is the last stronghold against further authoritarian developments there '' . 
  anyway - that 's a very long stretch, 
   according to several very large multinational coorperations hehehe, 
  it 's just an additional one - but shhhhh : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py_indubcxc, 
  this . 
  sheeple dont get it . 
   and refuses strongly to reform . 
   eu is an actual country to the degree germany is and here lies the exact reason it wo n't work . 
  you demand reforms going away from the possible future concept of `` eu being an actual country '' , while demanding a more democratic approach - which ulitmately leads to a transfer of powers towards brussels . 
  only other way is dismantle the european institutions and go back to square 1 - a more or less free trade agreement . 
  but just as we 2 wo n't agree on the correct way to go - so britain and the rest of europe wo n't . 
  ( yes - i know ... you are not the only ones ), 
   cutting expenses everywhere else . 
  which cuts ? 
  rent was upped more than 5 % recently . 
  its not a permanent situation and each house which is built now will be available in the future . 
  its just immoral to tell the low-incomes : `` look its their fault '' thats despicable, 
   more money than pensioners as you and i are german we can take the german example . 
  tghey in fact receive way less then hartz iv . 
  the complete housing , integration course and accompanying treatments ( health , etc. ), 
  do in fact cost more . 
  is that really a reason to put refugees against pensioneers ? 
  it 's not that we hand out money . 
  uh - just for my understanding : the court decides to approve of it 's own decision , although the gouvernment decided to ignore it ( by not publishing it ) ? 
  is that a tl ; dr ? 
  so basically a classic western stand-off ? 
  so sorry ... 
  right now 46 % of my highest income bracket , or roughly 40 % of my income . 
  ... it 's called taxes and i approve of the decision to spent part of them on housing refugees ... 
   the priority of any government is the pursuit of national interest and the welfare of its own citizens , foreigners come second at best . 
  neither is any basic human right formulated that way ( only italians ... ) in your constitution , nor does this overrule the right for asylum . 
  in the italian constitution that is . 
  you are actually right . 
  the problem of putting `` logic of money '' against `` logic of humanity '' predates that by far . 
  it derives from the bible ... ( mt 6,24 / lk 16,13 / kol 3,5 / eph 5,5 ) .
