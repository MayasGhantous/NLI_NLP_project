  the idea formulated by me had mostly mini , rolls-royce , nissan , ford exports from uk -  eu in mind . 
   a bad footing with a plan sounds better does n't it ? 
  i 'll give you that ... but actually all i can think of is in favour of the eu . 
  * the decline of the pound is faster than the euro * the uk needs to formulate a `` target framework '' - which will be challenged from all and every side ... while the eu can just sit and wait ... without formulating anything . 
  * the closer the relationship would be - the more the single states would ramp up `` their game '' pushing the uk towards the `` wto-default scenario '' - which would be the end of the city 's passporting rights - and challenging roughly 20 % of uk gdp . 
  the longer you wait the louder the scots will get . 
  from my perspective may has probably 2 months left . 
  after that she needs to come up with a plan - if the plan fails to convince the public then help you god ... because after that the economy would tank . 
   has no leverage picked . 
  not giving you a `` special deal '' is in no way the end of trade . 
  giving the uk a deal undermining the 4 pillars of the single market would actually be ... absolutley suicidal . 
  on a side note : there are very strange people actually promoting no trade deals at all : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lekeut1tilu, 
   norway not letting us in the eea gives us more bargaining power with the eu . 
  where does this idea of `` bargaining '' power actually come from ? 
  you do not have leverage ... there is none . 
  the fact of making an example out of the uk to stop others leaving alone is the death of all your leverage . 
  * dumm-di-dubdidu * i ` m out, 
  that would be https://www.nianticlabs.com/ job . 
  or mostly google itself should do it - they approved every single portal . 
   the pound is back up to 1.2 against the euro mate . 
  ... from 1.30 ... 
  fact remains : the uk has been hit harder ... roughly 10 % harder, 
   the 52 % are n't demanding it happen any time soon farage did ; leadsome did ... there are quite a few demanding this  we know it actually hurts the economies of the eu more well the pound had a much steeper decline than the euro ... so that 's not what 's happening . 
  german holocaust memorial ( berlin ) just stated the same . 
  although the whole area is riddled with ingress-portals ... and therefore soon to become major pokemon-playground . 
   automotive markets and honestly : tariffs wo n't be much of a problem - and all non-tariff regulations could just be uphold to eu-confirming from their site -  no problem in exporting . 
   should the uk do whats best for europe or whats best for the uk ? 
  it seems more and more people recognize that the `` whats best for the uk '' would have been a remain-vote ;-) nonetheless the venn-diagram holds still truth : https://twitter.com/quantian1/status/749675831719518208 not triggering art . 
  50 hurts us all - but over time mostly the uk ( also because the 52 % demand action ... ) . 
  and there is actually not one fair argument for not triggering it . 
  not having a pm ? 
  solved . 
  not having a plan ? 
  boy ... not the problem of everyone else ... not having personal ? 
  see before . 
  it 's quite easy ... the `` wait and see '' game hurts everyone . 
  the `` trigger it now '' game ... hurts mainly the uk . 
  oh ... and waiting will also put more pain onto the uk than onto the eu over the long term . 
   give us a cast iron guarantee of access to the common market without freedom of movement , and we 'll invoke article 50 right away . 
  how about ... not ? 
  why would anyone do this ? 
  after finishing this one : `` in ya face erdogan '', 
  probably the council , more prescisley [ didier seeuws ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-negotiator-idukkcn0zb0ut ) . 
  than we do have the question what actually is negotiated . 
  as some have said it is only the `` divorce '' - so no follow-up agreement . 
  that would be probably quite easy and the council/parliament could do this on it 's own . 
  or it 's an eea agreement - well this would obviously require an `` ok '' by all the others ( including norway i think ?!? ) . 
  and each and every one would probably seek it 's own success in it . 
  this would undoubtful not happen in 2 years time . 
  at a negative interest rate for loans everything is more expensive ... but we somehow decided all together that loans are basically bad thing . 
  not necessary . 
  we already have several pp-partnerships that did build the a8 . 
   by sending money home ? 
  that 's the idea . 
  tbh target2 is complictaed as shit - and even the experts do not agree about what it actually means : http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlwhelan/2012/11/19/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-target2-but-were-afraid-to-ask/#646f4f3716e6, 
  if the council would n't have him proposed ... he could not have been elected ... 
  problem is : we already have too little workforce ... reducing it to 4days/week would be quite disruptive - that much is true . 
  alternatively bringing in foreign eu-workers would benefit all of us much more though ( incl . 
  reducing imbalance ), 
  but :  the european council officially proposed juncker to parliament as candidate for the presidency on 27 june, 
  soooo ... what would you do ? 
  that is not correct - at the end juncker was appointed by 27 leaders ... after having basically a flea market bargain back-door discussion . 
  the fact that juncker was democratically `` proposed '' by the parliament ... does not change much about this . 
   constitution could you show me where this was written down in your written constitution ? 
  just for the pun ;-), 
   why should one care !? 
  do n't know if one should care - but cameron will be gone till the end of week ... so he should not be too busy caring . 
  although there would be some actions worth taking : the infrastructure investments could be boosted by public-private-partnership models . 
  and also by partially abandoning the 0 % - deficit goal ( ... at negative interest rates it is somehow workable ... i mean we can take loans that essentially pay for exisitng loans ... ), 
  are you a [ pomologyst ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomology ) ? 
   one factor against it : language . 
  more than one . 
  general business-friendly climate is kind of missing ( 35h week ... ) - and u forgot about dublin - still a contender . 
   the eea is part of the single market , but not other eu pillars . 
  http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement :  the eea agreement provides for the inclusion of eu legislation covering the four freedoms -- the free movement of goods , services , persons and capital -- throughout the 31 eea states . 
   germany germany will most likely see a re-run of merkel and an `` un-interesting '' left candidate . 
  neither of them will promise to be `` tough '' - noone would `` win '' by giving such a statement . 
  both would probably support being tough anyway though . 
   her intention for us to remain in the common market and keep freedom of movement where ??? 
  i only heard about restricting immigration - which basically rules out access to the single market . 
   council will appoint a negotiation team http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/684415/brexit-talks-who-will-lead-negotiations-in-the-eu ... seems to be an ongoing dicussion - but i get the `` general idea '' of not interfering with the elections . 
   reported exactly ... heathen !!, 
  no 10 say pm will `` not get in the way '' of hand over to theresa may https://twitter.com/bbcnormans?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw, 
   negotiations which experts expect the germans/french to be directly involved in those brexit negotiations ? 
  well the pound sterling jumped to an ( ... ) all-day-high upon the news about may ... because brexit might be aviodablke ... so the bankers think . 
  may wo n't trigger art. 50 before end of year ... 
  https://twitter.com/carlmaxim/status/752457887822278656 https://twitter.com/carlmaxim/status/752456361980620804 ;-) or even better ( tories could copy & paste ) :  the rules of the labour party constitution are clear . 
  before they can stand , any nominee must first capture 20 % of available pok\u00e9mon . 
  so gove back in the game ? 
  or bojo reapperieng ? 
  jeeeees ...  tory party rules : `` neither of the two candidates to go forward to the general membership may withdraw without the agreement of both the chairman of the 1922 committee and the board of the party . 
  the candidate remaining would be subject to ratification under schedule 2 , rule 7 . '', 
   the relevant part of rule 7 reads `` the election of the nominee may if so ordered by the board be ratified by a ballot of the party members and scottish party members to be held within one month of the close of nomination . 
  as of now it seems the next pm is called may , and is just hours away . 
   1,000 prominent british lawyers said in a letter to prime minister david cameron . 
  why should he care ? 
  they will love it when corporate tax is only 10 % and they can profit from the easy way to transfer their profits to a british overseas territory of their choice . 
  i 'm sure they will applaud the tories for these moves to strngthen the ~ ~ consumer ~ ~ corporate base . 
  replace ? 
  compete ?
