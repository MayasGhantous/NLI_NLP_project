  most likely frankfrut and paris . 
  reread about the difference between free trade and single market - come back after , rephrasing that confusing questions . 
  on a side note : why is the thumbg a rocket being fired ? 
  sometimes i too wonder where the border between calm diplomacy and pure pussydom exactly is ... 
  how the fuck did the french win against us ???? 
  `` its not retaliation , its democracy ... just the one of the others ``, 
  did i just witness a guy telling the mp : `` trade agreements are totally irrelevant . 
  '' ... ok then .

  sure pisshead _ -- all is illegal, 
  there was this ( kind of sadistic ) rumour of an offering : * restriction of freedom of movement * full single market access ... for products * no passporting for services ( banks ) that is brutal . 
  the brexiters would get all they want ( shitting on banksters and restricting immigrants ) , there would not be a good way to argument against it - while 20 % of the uks gdp would be suddenly at risk ... ... choose now, 
   dissatisfied with eu 's handling of migrants from outside europe this is one of the more interesting explanations : http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/personal-values-brexit-vote/, 
  frankfurt is horny as fuck for all the bankers : http://frankfurt-main-finance.com/en/bcg-study-frankfurt-most-attractive-destination-for-londons-bankers/ and the londonstockexchange just merged with deutscheboerse, 
   want i guess she just ca n't . 
  it would mean freedom of movement and she knows . 
  if i were her i would at that point just say : `` leadsome - it 's all yours ... the whole fucking mess '', 
  wait for it ... now noone comes forward with plans to move . 
  i mean the article says the major ceos stopped by at no. 10 expressing their concern ... 
  it also very much depends if hollande lets you keep the euro clearing : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-29/hollande-says-brexit-to-hurt-city-of-london-in-clearing-warning, 
  that might be it ... mroldfarttrump, 
  `` if you come to the uk - you get access to another 27 countries '', 
  in other words : http://www.vox.com/2016/7/5/12098156/brexit-eu-britain-venn-diagram, 
  same same, 
  ... well fuck me ... of course there is a wiki-page for that . 
  is there a list of all the `` eiffel towers '' in the world ? 
  i know the chinese one , and stood next to the one in las vegas . 
  where else ? 
   for the very first time the greeks , the germans , the poles , spanish face the same personal problems . 
  being angry at the brits ? 
  think of a stripper - should work ( ... you know dancing on a pole ), 
   koscielny east european black - ... or something, 
  sooo much better ... 
  the maximum can be extended though . 
  that 's why i wrote min . 
  what an excuse for a human being ... 
  well ... im not a lawyer . 
  and even if . 
  i doubt the eu would stop the uk to `` speak `` with eg china . 
   it 's a fact . 
  i got it ... cause u said so and you know shit , right ? 
   runs a surplus not wanting to go there ... but the surplus ger/eu keeps declining ... the surplus ger/restofworld keeps increasing ... which increases the surplus euro/roe ... quite a good thing though . 
   but they can still interact on whichever topics they want with foreign countries they ca n't ... because that 's exclusivly the commissions job . 
  so if they would do it themselves ... they would breach the law : article 207 ( ex article 133 tec ) 1 . 
  the common commercial policy shall be based on uniform principles , particularly with regard to changes in tariff rates , the conclusion of tariff and trade agreements relating to trade in goods and services , and the commercial aspects of intellectual property , foreign direct investment , the achievement of uniformity in measures of liberalisation , export policy and measures to protect trade such as those to be taken in the event of dumping or subsidies . 
  the common commercial policy shall be conducted in the context of the principles and objectives of the union 's external action . 
  the european parliament and the council , acting by means of regulations in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure , shall adopt the measures defining the framework for implementing the common commercial policy . 
  where agreements with one or more third countries or international organisations need to be negotiated and concluded , article 218 shall apply , subject to the special provisions of this article . 
  the commission shall make recommendations to the council , which shall authorise it to open the necessary negotiations . 
  the council and the commission shall be responsible for ensuring that the agreements negotiated are compatible with internal union policies and rules . 
  the commission shall conduct these negotiations in consultation with a special committee appointed by the council to assist the commission in this task and within the framework of such directives as the council may issue to it . 
  the commission shall report regularly to the special committee and to the european parliament on the progress of negotiations . 
  for the negotiation and conclusion of the agreements referred to in paragraph 3 , the council shall act by a qualified majority .

  it 's people like you that put the `` semantic fertilizer '' to the soil in which xenophobia and racism florish and grow ... there is a word for those in german : `` geistige brandstifter '' ( literally `` spiritual/intelectual arsonists ) ... 
  ... the daily express is filled up with them ... and you are one too, 
  as a reminder : https://youtu.be/ustypbked8y?t=847 the liverpool professor said exactly the same ... 
   britain can begin negotiating with any third party that is actually debatable . 
  because they would breach the eu contracts by doing so . 
  and as \u00a7 50 states they are still part of the eu for at least 2 years after triggering it - they also would be bound to the restrictions coming with that . 
  worse : they could then also get kicked out ... for breaching the contracts . 
  although this is kind of theoretical after all ... but still . 
   i never said that though . 
  sure ... the daily express never said bad things about immigrants either ... yet ... 
   they were more efficient in production https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_hour_worked place 6 ; 5 european countries higher  set up a european currency it is mostly agreed upon that france forced germany into the euro : http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/article/351531-you-get-unification-we-get-euro wan na keep playing ? 
   and how it basically allows germany to suck any competition out of it . 
  hehehe ... says mr `` reddithatesfacts '' backed up by sources ;-), 
   the whole thing is set up to primarily benefit them well ... i like to play this game - because this sentence is just wrong . 
   you 're trying this shit with the wrong person . 
  oh i guess not . 
  everyone coming along the `` germany wants those syrians to have a slave work force and depress wages '' - line is basically ... a cunt . 
   so you believe the this we were so poor as children crap ! , his family were always minted his brother owned corkers on the quay years ago he was a prat too . 
  believe me i know , i used to work at the place that printed their menus . 
  they both swan around like they are royalty . 
  that is personal spite ... and envy, 
   eastern europe moved to germany ( along with syria ) so that 's not a problem . 
  you might get it back when you drop your corporate tax to 10 % ... hope you like the cuts to be made elsewhere, 
  it might be a little bit unsettling if you think about the next steps to happen . 
  i mean if they realize those `` elites in westminster still did not listen '' - what would they vote then ? 
  might be that tipping point theory . 
  basically a mood swing . 
  the reasons did not change ... but the emphasise might have . 
   i think one is confirmation bias i honestly did n't realize it ( or was even looking for ) till the 3 ladies at the end . 
  i mean , if some `` old miner/sailor '' has not much teeth that is not so much suprising . 
  but the 3 ladies at the end ?
