  ( kind of sounds like putin : `` excellent time to revamp our own industry ! '' ), 
   and a lot of the drop in pounds has already reversed itself it 's down 5 % again today ... it keeps going down . 
  here have again the detail on why especially the ftse 250 is much more important : http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/06/27/uk-centric-ftse-250-drops-5-5/ in case of paywall : the ftse 250 has taken another big hit today , sliding 5.5 per cent to a new four-month low as post-referendum fears for the uk economy take their toll on domestic-focused stocks . 
  today 's drop takes the ftse 250 's post-referendum decline to 12.6 per cent . 
  on friday it fell 7.2 per cent , its worst one-day drop since 1987 . 
  the ftse 100 is largely made up of companies that derive their income overseas , and receive revenue in dollars , meaning the pound 's sharp drop provides them with a boost . 
  ftse 100 companies derive only 28 per cent of their revenues in the uk , according to jpmorgan , compared with 59 per cent for the ftse 250 . 
  the ftse 100 has dropped 4.9 per cent since the vote , compared with 12.6 per cent for the ftse 250 . 
  `` we expect the sell-off in uk assets that started as the results became clear to continue over coming days , '' warns jpmorgan , adding `` within the uk equity market , we see more medium-term downside risk to ftse250 vs ftse100 . '' dean turner at ubs wealth management predicts domestic-focused stocks will see `` earnings downgrades on weaker growth '' , whereas `` the more insulated defensive or international stocks will benefit from currency boosts '' . 
  he paints a bleak picture for the uk 's post-referendum prospects , warning that the drop in the pound will push up inflation and unemployment will rise , while `` the hit to real incomes is likely to lower consumer spending , posing downside risks to our already lowered growth forecasts . '' this combination will fuel stagflation , he predicts , and says equity markets will likely remain volatile .

  it did so in 2 days ... in a economy that showed the highest growth in europe ( mosttly ) . 
  it is not the apocalypse ... but it hurts - and will keep hurting many . 
  in 2 days ... 
  yes that is bad . 
  it 's not apocalypse - but bad . 
  here have a particular stock : aldermore : * thursday : 205.7 * today : 114.9 http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/summary/company-summary/gb00bqqmcj47gbgbxstmm.html, 
  would n't be so sure ... 
  nigel farage says britain heading for recession ` regardless of brexit ' http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/nigel-farage-ukip-britain-recession-brexit, 
  it 's actually 8mins long : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ikd7a2vuhs, 
  let me rephrase this : `` what would be the `` worst '' the swiss could decide upon , ** effecting everyone else ** ? 
  :p '' i know what they decided - now does anyone give a fuck about it outside their valleys and bank vaults ? 
  hehe ... yes so it seems, 
   that makes john oliver a cunt too that makes him someone simplifying a situation for a foreign audience ... not the best - but clearly it does not change much, 
  ok - so farage is out ... he could have used iain duncan ... would not have made any difference . 
  and this moron actually stood in front of the bus , while now going `` i never said that '' ... : http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/eu-referendum-brexit-vote-leave-iain-duncan-smith-nhs, 
   why because you say so ? 
  yes because i and many others did say so - because the pure fact we do see it as a sign - makes it a sign ... what are you vene talking about ? 
  it 's either reform or brust - everyone got that now . 
  if you ask `` based on what '' what does that even mean ? 
  do you look for a reason to `` not move '' ? 
   good for exports and keeps the imports down that would be totally cool ... if the uk had n't a deficit of 165bn $ of more importing than exporting . 
  this deficit did just rise by 10 % - the value gbp/usd lost . 
   if one of merkel 's colleagues was found being racist oh absolutely i would . 
  and about your `` ca n't discuss anything around here '' - comment . 
  the `` farage did n't say that '' argument is such a non-argument , when it basically was a lie - and many people believed the lie . 
  so does it really matter who did lie ? 
  us minion doing the w\u00f6rk - perfect, 
   farage actually said that # 350m would go to the nhs does it even matter if farage said it - or the leave-campaign ? 
  most could not see any difference between the two . 
  at the end of the day - yes : someone put it on a fucking bus . 
  well it 's a sign to move ahead ( where ever ahead may be - but moving in itself woul\u00f6d be a positive sign for the eu ) . 
  now you do not have to take care of the uk . 
  so it 's either reforming towards a better european future ( `` make europe great again ! '' ), 
  or it bursts . 
  because the paper sounds quite reasonable ? 
  at least to me ... 
  the original sentence : `` what does not kill me , makes me stronger . '', 
  is from nietzsche ( 1888 ), 
  belgian chocolate is as good if not better . 
  on the other hand : what would be the `` worst '' the swiss could decide upon effecting everyone else ? 
  dial 0049-30 - for all-europe access, 
   submit or perish go with us or stay behind , would probably be a better wording, 
   bojo is basically outlining a full eea status for britain . 
  not what brexiteers voted for . 
  should come to frankfurt then . 
  deutsche already here ... 
  this . 
  if you fucking change the metric it goes down even though the numbers do not move ... anyone telling this has an agenda, 
   uk politicians have all interest to stall the situation , why ? 
  it will hurt us all - uk and the rest - and at some point they probably want `` their money back '' ( ... to invest it in the nhs ... ) . 
  i mean if turkey gets their visa-deal in october the uk electorate will flip their shit , right ? 
   for all intents and purposes nothing may change to our current situation . 
  that sir is just delusional ... 
  thx - i know , but the tablet-browser kind of did n't want to ... 
  @evanhd is n't happy with this potential change of tone on freedom of movement ... #brexit #newsnight http://snpy.tv/28xbbyx, 
  soon ... 
  frankfurt has some things going for it ... ecb , located in main euro-country , central europe ... 
   what kind of relationship not paying , no immigrations , access to the markets - so a trade agreement ttip-style . 
   to do things in a slow i 'm afraid - the waiting will hurt us all ... but most likely the uk - as noone invests on moving targets . 
   two speed confirmed !, 
  if she is not completely retarded that is a given anyway . 
   decided its strategy i do n't get it - what 's left to decide ? 
   uk should act in its own interests was n't that what 's all about ? 
  so why does n't he want to start immediately to `` save those 350mn/week for the nhs ? '', 
  yes - denial is in ... one has no official plan to do so : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/morgan-stanley-brexit-eu-referendum-jobs-dublin-frankfurt-a7100911.html, 
  if brexit is merkels fault you might be able to blame pompeji on her too ... 
  hehe - you my friend will soon get your own choice about even applying ;-), 
  frankfurt real estate prices are already on the rise ... 
  morgan stanley looks to move 2,000 london staff posted at 14:45 bbc business reporter joe lynam reports ... sources within morgan stanley say it has already begun the process of moving about 2,000 of its london-based investment banking staff to dublin or frankfurt . 
  and it has a taskforce in place . 
  the jobs which would be moved from the uk would be in euro clearing but also other investment banking functions and senior management . 
  the american investment bank needs to avail of the passporting system which allows banks to offer financial services in all countries in the eu without having to establish a permanent base in that member state . 
  the president of morgan stanley , colm kelleher , told bloomberg two days ago that brexit would be `` the most consequential thing that we 've ever seen since the war '' . 
   the leave vote stood at 56.48 % while remain dwindled at 43.45 % . 
  ... oh the irony, 
  i 'll go with jk rowling on this one : `` scotland will seek independence now . 
  cameron 's legacy will be breaking up two unions . 
  neither needed to happen . '', 
  hope you do n't break you unions neck on the way ... 
  that was the point ... 
   can trigger # 50 when we please oh sure ... you will just prolong the uncertainty ... the ftse will show ... and there might come the point people actually demand that those 350mn go towards the nhs ... loel, 
   there are deals to make which ? 
  not a single eu-partner/country will `` negotiate '' with the uk before the \u00a7 50 is not triggered - while you can not negotiate anything outside the eu till you did not exit ... 
   eu members wait wait to do what ? 
  this question had a sharp rise on google.co.uk ... in the last 12 hours ... 
   there is still a huge stock selloff yes absolutely - but as the validation metric ( = pound sterling ) itself is also falling , the effect is not as big as you would consider it to be . 
   cheaper for foreign investors exactly what i said : the majority of the ftse-companies have revenue-streams originating outside of the uk ( rbs , lloyds , bp , etc. ) . 
  now if you price those in pound sterling the falling currency comes into effect - and so while it would fall - 10 % if it would be priced in $ it only falls 5 % in pound - because the pound itself did also fall 5 %, 
  the even better sentence is : `` this does not mean that the uk is any less united '' ... while scotland and ni prepare their departure ... on the `` when trigger \u00a7 50 '' : easy - the longer you wait the more uncertainty you have , the worse the economy will fare ...
