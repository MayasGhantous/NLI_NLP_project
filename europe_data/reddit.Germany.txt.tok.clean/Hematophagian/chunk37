  the fact that the ftse did n't plunge as sharp is based on the also fact , that the pound sterling dropped sharply ... and therefore the stock is falling without moving the numbers . 
  is he for real ? 
  `` associated partnership '' ... a term invented to hold turkey at `` arms length '' - what an irony ... 
  on a side note : it 's damn difficult to find something `` purely made in the uk '' ... hershey ? 
  `` yes but you run the risk of getting kicked out once it happens '' ( although i deem the risk a minor one ), 
  are you for real ? 
  btw . 
  shell is dutch ... 
   merkel behaved by playing tough with greece oh boy - if the uk would have had to pay 1 penny for the greeks they would have flayed them alive ... 
  well said sir, 
  not much need for negotiation . 
  they just quit the rebate , pay the same money and accept the same rules , drop their european meps and commisionars and done deal ... ... only that these seems all the things they do not want, 
   because the euro is being hit worse than the pound . 
  as of exactly now : * gbp/usd : -4.56 % * eur/usd : -1.72 %, 
   the message from britain what exactly was their message ? 
  `` we are special - get lost ? '', 
  europe is a half-finished construct . 
  either finish it or ( at least with some countries ) or see it crumble ... easy as that . 
   also is n't merkel going out inevitably ? 
  who is replacing her ? 
  will be replaced by ... merkel ... 
  boris or nigel . 
  regarding all those human rights violations over the years ... i doubt you would get a chance ... ( / s :p ), 
  bets are already open : johnson is seen as 50 per cent likely , may is on 20 per cent , gove on 15 per cent . 
  you allowed it ... 
  glorious carolingian empire - not the other one . 
  morgan stanley on that question : we do see a political route to reversing the decision -- a new parliament with a majority for a pro-remain party which is either elected on a reversal platform or subsequently holds and wins a new referendum on reversing the decision . 
  but this is quite an ask : first , the reversal of the decision probably has to be done before the uk actually exits , since at that point the uk may lose its special status ( its opt-outs from the euro and schengen and the rebate ) , which would significantly reduce the attractiveness of eu membership . 
  this , in turn , would require early dissolution of parliament . 
  that would requires some conservative mps to vote against the government , given that the condition for early dissolution is : a ) a two-thirds majority of mps voting in favour of a new election , or b ) that the government loses a vote of confidence ( and that another government can not be formed within two weeks ) . 
  second , there is a risk that if the eu and uk get into an acrimonious divorce , then uk political sentiment will harden behind leave .

  ... for the better ;-), 
  yeah ... he says so himself ... https://twitter.com/gmb/status/746218028195426305 nontheless bitter ... 
  ... what a bitter moment : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/nigel-farage-350-million-pledge-to-fund-the-nhs-was-a-mistake/, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ixs80pams4 granted - this one we did import ourselves ( obviously ), 
   force a very soft brexit which will not be granted ... 
  it says : `` we send the eu350mn a week - let 's fund our nhs instead '' to me it seems they want to relocated 350mn/wseek towards the nhs ... which would not work . 
   is clearly asking , where the exact figure comes from . 
  no it 's not . 
  i want to know where the heck you get 350mn in funds to redistribute towards the nhs after you left the eu - because it 's clearly not the `` redirected '' eu funds that could cover that sum - so it 's a blatant lie, 
  spiegel had it - maybe the call was too early ... 
   the ifs the institute for fiscal studies gives you money ? 
  boy i always thought they would be more of a cost center than a profit center ... how did you guys manage that one ? 
  armed = gas pistol , no live rounds fired !, 
   read the fucking bus . 
  i did - now tell me where you get 350mn from ? 
   everyone who has been watching the leave campaign knows this is their modus operandi . 
  again ... obviously 50 % are too stupid to know that . 
  qed - now close the door when you leave today ;-), 
   it 's misleading not incorrect . 
  no it 's not correct - you do not have 350mn to put into the nhs after `` voting leave '' ( let aside the fact that even the smallest trade agreement would cost money ), 
  i do not see how the average `` leave voter '' is intellectually capable to distinguish these descriptions - let alone wants to distnguish it ... and saying `` we could put all the money towards the nhs '' shows this very obviously ... there just would not be 350m pounds to `` put somewhere else '' . 
   because economic pressure does n't exist . 
  and while we are at it ... whats that `` magic ingredient '' . 
  you think somehow the european council/parliament comes together and says : * `` let 's see who 's got a majority ? 
  oh the uk has ... now we just wave the magic stick and suddenly the `` economic power '' devalues your majority - bad luck for you uk ! '' . 
  as long as mr.farage does not attend at eg fishery quota negotiations as a member of the european parliament , but afterwards cries about the outcome , i wonder how more spoiled the majority of england could get . 
  i did like 4hours ago below ... 
  but for yours only : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nearly-half-of-britons-believe-vote-leaves-false-350-million-a-week-to-the-eu-claim-a7085016.html  nearly half of the british public believe vote leave 's claim that the uk pays # 350 million a week to the european union despite the figure being debunked , a poll shows . 
   ipsos mori found that 47 per cent of the public believe that the claim , which has been repeatedly criticised by the uk statistics authority , is true . 
  i would assume the last week has seen heavily trading in index options for both calls and puts . 
  somehow the calls just outweight the puts . 
   basic math lesson for you here . 
  you say that 50 % of leave voters believe the # 350 figure . 
  leave is 50 % of the population . 
  whats 50 % of 50 % ? 
  it 's not 50 % of leave ; it 's 50 % of all voters :  nearly half of the ** british public ** believe vote leave 's claim that the uk pays # 350 million a week to the european union despite the figure being debunked , a poll shows . 
   offshore rock i like that ;-), 
   we do n't control the reduction ??? 
  so you really wan na tell me someone `` ear-marks '' the amount of 100mn/week in the national budget because suddenly someone would come along and `` delete '' the rebate ? 
  could you show me where the accrual is made ? 
   if the uk is one of the three pillars it 's quite complicated if one `` pillar '' always tries to leave the roof he is holding up ... while also screaming at the top of it 's lungs how the roof ca n't be handled that way ... just to stay in your picture ... 
   german calls people stupid so far i did provide evidence of 50 % of the british eloctorate clearly not understanding how much the uk pays towards europe ( = being stupid ) , while all you did was insult the germans/french for `` chaotic leadership '' , which is inherently impossible due to veto-rights ... 
   we ` send ' # 350m no you do not - you send 250 , of which you get roughly 75mn back . 
  the rebate is subtracted before you even touch/sent those 350mn . 
  ( src : https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/ ), 
  did you vote already ? 
  why are you still here then ? 
   losing control of the 350m a week still do not get it . 
  how exactly are they `` loosing control '' of those 100mn pounds ? 
   loses control of # 350 million a week which could be directed to programs as they see fit . 
  they 've also made it very clear that the total payment is # 250 million a week after rebates . 
  that does contradict itself ... the rebate is subtracted before the uk even touches a penny of the 350mn . 
   using the term in its modern generic sense of `` poor country '' yes, 
  no it 's worse : turkey used to be a 2nd world country ( and in parts still is ) . 
  and it has 75mn people in it . 
  the eastern european extension taught the eu to be cautious at what point to include what amount of people with what `` economic development '' . 
  in addition to that obviously noone had any interest to open the necessary chapters - not mentioning the continous human rights violations . 
  and one most important point : as long as they do not even recognize cyprus - they ( and let me put this very clear ) : can ultimately get fucked , because they actually do behave like assholes ( ... not only erdogan ), 
  [ nearly half of britons believe vote leave 's false ' # 350 million a week to the eu ' claim ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nearly-half-of-britons-believe-vote-leaves-false-350-million-a-week-to-the-eu-claim-a7085016.html ) the 50 % seems to be perfectly accurate, 
  the title alone seems like a continous entitlement of a demanding little toddler ... ... how about `` the rest of europe could n't be bothered any addtional minute with the little kids mood . 
  now vote and get done with it either way '', 
  we do n't want you because you behave like a gigantic asshole . 
  good thing the government did shut it down before ... 
  tl ; dr let you company pay for some magic abstract `` brand license fee '' towards your dutch company : no taxes on license revenue -  profit .
