   freedom of movement for refugee there actually is n't - and the benefits are n't that good in germany either . 
  nonetheless - i would porbably try to get to germany too if i would sit in poland :p, 
  just like switzerland is the worlds biggest copper exporter ... on paper . 
  ( thx to glencore ), 
  does it though ? 
  the main contra-arguments would probably be : * in contrast to the `` 325/week '' we do pay around 450mn/week ( gross that is ) * we gurantee for pretty much 21 % of everything . 
  of anything the ecb holds ( incl . 
  state and company bonds ) , the efsfs/esfm and the rest, 
  uh wow - my aston martin just came down from 135.000 $ to 129.000 $ - now that 's making my decision fairly easy ... especially with all this perfect interior : https://youtu.be/mi0yxeuqbju?t=53, 
  you are welcome ... now take in those refugees ;-), 
  1,4 kids/couple does this . 
  need to w\u00f6rk , so we can keep paying pesky southern europeans ... no time for kids . 
   no idea it was illegal in germany ... only thing happening is a `` tanzverbot '' literally `` dancing prohibited '' . 
  in other words : clubs ca n't open and play loud music . 
  it 's a regional ( federal ) regulation and differs across germany . 
  none of this affects hard licquor drinking in any bar ... 
   you do realise that access to the common market is free trade right there are differences . 
  nicely put together by the ft over here : http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1688d0e4-15ef-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e.html, 
  + the fact that a single market agreement certainly does not know a `` rebate '' ... 
  uh - in 2004 ( after eastwards expansion ) all nations decided to restrict freedom of movement ... besides the following 3 countries : * sweden * uk * ireland, 
  being generous to the uk would be suicidal for the eu ... no more `` special treatment '' - otherwise it would just be cherry-picking . 
  such a deal was never possible ( with iran/russia ) . 
  it may become possible - but only by negotiations ... and not with bombs ( or feet on sand ), 
  now ? 
  more ? 
  never ever, 
  the hinges are german !, 
  no way you unscrew them !, 
   aka acquiesce to europe 's demands as long as you do not get the fact that you are europe too - it wo n't work with the uk as member . 
   blaming ` murica is n't going to make this problem go away tough . 
  oh i did n't - just reminded of the `` equal share '' . 
   just apply the solution used in bosnia . 
  in syria ? 
  how should that one work ? 
  on a side note : syria is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  when water runs out , 50mn will `` do the walk '' . 
   this has been the eu 's response to the situation in syria thus far . 
   this has been europe 's response to the libya crisis , which lead to the country 's civil war . 
  well those two have been fucked up with your participation ... and noone has the ability to `` occupy and rebuild '' either country . 
   doing something about the arab spring ? 
  oh that was n't a jest at all - it 's just obvious . 
  although i tend to bet on a remain vote . 
  taught to hate downwards ... by those mentioned `` bunch of neo-liberals '' ... all working according to plan . 
   a phobia indicates irrationality . 
  does it ? 
  its greek and means literally nothing else than `` fear '' . 
  frankfurt real estate prices will spike on 24th , 
  it 's worse . 
  because triggering art . 
  50 explicitly states `` two years negotiation time maximum - then all rules cease to exist for the leaving party '' . 
  this time can then be extended by unanimous ( !!! ), 
  vote . 
  so worst case : 2 years negotiation , and the uk drops out of eu for two more years till any kind of deal could be found . 
   so 4 years of uncertainty probably only two ( as this is the max . 
  time period for art . 
  50 exit ) , or slightly more . 
   it ignores that west germany and other european countries benefitted enormously from the marshall plan . 
  i wo n't go in too many details here , but poland receives almost the same amount/year that germany received as a whole in the marshal plan ... in adjusted values that is !, 
  both are facts ... and totally unrelated . 
  ( starting ww1 is debatable though ), 
  ... so what do you imply here ? 
  that because ww2 eastern euopean ~ ~ thugs ~ ~ patriots are allowed to confiscate reperations in germany ? 
  by burglary ? 
   eurobonds  greece * shudder *, 
   still taking assets away i will admit that i do n't have complete insight in what they do/could do . 
  i understand your balance sheet example , though i struggle to understand : * when the ecb buys corporate bonds - should n't that blow up the balance sheet of the euro-zone ? 
  * what did the fed do on-top ? 
  * would that still work if the ecb would do it now ? 
  germany is number 3 or 4 to achieve this . 
  japan and sweden already did that . 
  we got a whole agency doing nothing else ... : http://www.deutsche-finanzagentur.de/en/institutional-investors/portfolio-management/, 
   let the ecb create it . 
  the ecb is already doing the absolute maximum to devalue the euro . 
  next step would be free money for end-consumers ( aka `` helicopter-money '' ), 
   although it would definitely be a great idea to refinance all of your old bonds . . well thats obviously an on-going process, 
  the greens - which are part of 8 state-governments . 
  the law has to be ratified by the bundesrat ( federal council ) - the equivalent of a `` senate '' . 
   do n't get the sun down under but plenty of murdoch i would assume ;-), 
   of all three current presidencies : president of the european council ( since 1 december 2014 , donald tusk ) president of the european commission ( since 1 november 2014 , jean-claude juncker ) president of the european parliament ( since 1 july 2014 , martin schulz ) you do realize that you just slumped the legislature and the executive together ? 
  you also do realize that this is the definition of abolishing democracy ? 
  ( i stopped there btw ... ), 
  yeah let 's turn that around : although it was possible to restrict the `` immigration '' of eastern european workers for 2 additional years , the only nations not doing it in 2004 have been : * uk * sweden * ireland, 
  maybe an interesting read and relevant : nytimes policy on ad-block lead to this comment :  just went to the ny times with adblock off to check . 
  http://i.imgur.com/rsooc2m.jpg 2.8 megabytes of the page is javascript ( largely code which tracks you on sites ( edit : talking about the 212 javascripts in my screenshot , not the entirety of . js in existence ) the site is 23 megabytes after you allow the ads to finish loading several minutes after initial page load , they continue running and downloading forever it seems . 
  it requests over 2000 elements !, 
  ** it sets cookies for 20 different domains . 
  ** edit : as i wrote this the page bloated to 8500 requests and 75 megabytes !, 
  one single page in 10 minutes . 
  they hover over the page , are constantly running code in the console tracking god knows what . 
  your criteria are reasonable , and they are n't even in the same ballpark or playing the same sport . 
  sure ... but the answer would be `` european-wide '' - on a side note : the uk car industry is quite german itself ... 
  greece always had an opt-out ... they just could n't afford it to go broke . 
  yes - probably you should . 
  especially when london partially shifts to frankfurt . 
  2 years is enough to run an economy into the ground, 
  at the end it wo n't be the final deal or the rights/dutys that costs the uk economy , but the 2-year negotiations , with complete unpredictable outcome : * `` yeah maybe a swiss-sytle canada ceta kind of norwegian-relationship ? 
  with hookers and blow , you know ? '', 
   brexit campaign as far as i understood they do n't want to stay in the common market too ? 
  the rebates would be gone either way ... that 'll be 4bn more . 
   he got of quite easily as it seems .
