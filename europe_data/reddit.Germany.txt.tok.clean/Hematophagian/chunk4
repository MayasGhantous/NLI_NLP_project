  and no i #m in no way religious - but the bible too is a philosophical book . 
   who has come over for welfare and an easy living that exactly is the question . 
  did he ? 
  or did he really flee , because either his live was in danger ? 
  was it threatened in turkey ? 
  ( that last question is vain thoguh since the deal ) . 
  you assume everyone to be a leech , i do n't . 
  but i also never said noone was . 
   `` us '' depends on your perspective - `` us '' as in `` human '' ? 
  i guess so ; `` us '' as in `` someone th eu accepts in it 's borders '' - still yes ; `` us '' as `` of italian blood and honor '' - probably not . 
   this is about money . 
  is n't that exactly what i said ? 
  playing the neediest among us against each other is a sure shot to spike sentiment against one group - easy to see against which one . 
  and besides all the potentialy correct discussions and arguments - when you start gaming money against humanity you already have lost . 
  edit : `` for this statement of philosophy from an age of enlightment i supose to receive -12 to -18 in downvotes '', 
  you just do not understand the underlying erotic concept . 
  its not about actually doing it , its about the imaginary idea and desire . 
  just like the austrians , you just had to go for it . 
  you sure ? 
  i thought at least 50 % are set-up this way : theres a blue force and a red . 
  blue has to secure csg for 2 days , red has to sink it . 
  both grps have to stay inside this area , now go . 
   pedo-icon wine , cheese and pedo-icons ... you got ta love france, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hph73xjxkyo i mean - do n't get me wrong : still hot . 
  but definitley different than back then : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzlgnj-rixw, 
  who 's the french `` close to illegal lolita-style girlie '' nowadays ? 
  after sophie marcau , charlotte gainsbourg , vanessa paradies and alizee ? 
  he missed the / s - or he bet he would not need it - for you . 
  this isn not / r/murica, 
  their body , their choice . 
  but a discussion if he can afterwards abandon the kid just started recently in sweden i think . 
   what do they want with subs anyway ? 
  ( a ) they 're landlocked , and ( b ) did n't they do enough damage already , militarily , by being the birthplace of hitler ? 
  and all those mountains ... 
  \u0160e\u0161elj brings it close to the others, 
  +1 german : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4ujcgp9tdi, 
  the list of small disel or fuel-cell subs sinking us navy carriers in nato exercises is quite long - here just some examples : in 2006 the chinese navy song class diesel-electric submarine famously reached within striking distance of the uss kitty hawk undetected . 
  however in naval exercises a total of seven us navy aircraft carriers have reportedly been sunk by non-nuclear submarines . 
  1981 : uss eisenhower was sunk in nato exercises in the atlantic ocean by royal canadian navy porpoise class diesel-electric submarine built in britain in the 1960 's , and was n't even detected by us navy asw assets . 
  1981 : during the same exercise the uss forrestal was also sunk by an unidentified diesel-electric submarine , probably a british royal navy submarine . 
  1989 : uss america sunk in the atlantic ocean by dutch navy zwaardvis class diesel-electric submarine . 
  1996 : uss independence sunk by the chilean navy german built type-209 class diesel-electric class submarine in the pacific ocean . 
  1999 : uss theodore roosevelt sunk by the dutch navy walrus class diesel-electric submarine in the atlantic ocean . 
  2003 : unidentified us navy aircraft carrier sunk by two royal australian navy collins class diesel-electric submarines in the pacific ocean . 
  2005 : uss ronald reagan sank by swedish navy gotland class aip submarine in the pacific ocean . 
  the german subs seem to be a very specialized breed . 
  small for shallow water , non-nuclear . 
  it was a loan in 1949 , and only in 1953 granted as free ... partially . 
  and to cite it here : `` germany , which up until the 1953 debt agreement had to work on the assumption that all the marshall plan aid was to be repaid , spent its funds very carefully . 
  payment for marshall plan goods , `` counterpart funds '' , were administered by the reconstruction credit institute , which used the funds for loans inside germany . 
  in the 1953 debt agreement the amount of marshall plan aid that germany was to repay was reduced to less than 1 billion usd . 
  [ 88 ] this made the proportion of loans versus grants to germany similar to that of france and the uk . 
  [ 87 ] the final german loan repayment was made in 1971 . 
  [ 89 ] since germany chose to repay the aid debt out of the german federal budget , leaving the german erp fund intact , the fund was able to continue its reconstruction work . 
  by 1996 it had accumulated a value of 23 billion deutsche mark . 
  had to learn the enemies language as spy ;-), 
   derivative business value oh sure any invest multiplies . 
  as in any other countriy that received funds from the plan ... so that 's a void argument . 
  130bn $ , of which ( as you stated above yourself ) 11 % went to germany . 
  roughly 12.5 bn edit : to update : the original amount was in fact 12bn $ : https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan, 
   you think a conceptual border is unfair ? 
  says the master of desaster fucking up 2 continents with borders drawn with a ruler - a british ruler, 
  to put that in some kind of perspective : the marshal plan loan was as high as germany pays to the eu/year now , or poland receives from the eu/year now . 
  roughly 12.5 bn . 
  nah we are much more subtle these times . 
  the filthy eastern subhumans are only short-time employed and importet to harvest our own crops from the fields and afterwards we just expose them by not paying it anymore . 
  see the forced labour thing is actually much more expensive then just paying them shitty wages far below any german to do the job . 
  and the knife was from chinese production . 
  cause and corelation . 
  he is right - and he did not state that this means the too are agreeing in views . 
  mostly english - or their own and have a translator . 
  for one - noone wants to be `` weak '' and not perfectly speaking the language , and for a second - translators are standard procedure . 
  here is a clip of putin in german . 
  he does speak it quite well : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qfsauyg8ws, 
  ;-) no actually i wanted to slice a loaf of bread , which became dry and resistant . 
  ended with the knife slicing over my thumb . 
  h\u00f6cke eg is not `` slightly right '' he is a full-blown right extremist and he will probably take over the presidency of the afd . 
  if it walk like a duck , squeaks like a duck - chances are high that it is in fact a duck . 
   overarching influence well , it seems some ideas just do n't lead to solutions . 
  we kind of accept that . 
  for the austrians : ca n't really answer , but to me it seems they think they just `` lend '' the guy to germany and only germany could have made all of that happen . 
  in this case it would be more appropriate to call it `` aryan guilt '' . 
  for your second sentence : building walls are n't our thing , you know ? 
  just export as much copper than switzerland and you will be rich too someday ... 
  because of that guy with that moustache ? 
  back in the days the idea was pretty much the opposite : * french : `` you quit that deutschmark though '' * german : `` nooooooo it has so much value '' * french : `` either that or no reunification '' * german : `` ok . 
  but only if we set up the whole thing as it would be deutschmark - with independant central bank , hookers and blow and frankfurt '' * french : `` ok '' now it happened it is not that stropng of a currency and we discovered we could live with that pretty comfortable - so noone complains . 
  sophie marceau set the standard for me ... as a 13year old watching la boum . 
  ca n't change from there . 
  do n't go there - at the end everyones hurt . 
  although i would say : germanys good at a broader level , but spain is good by having the best teams ( a look at champions league results will show this ) . 
  does that one come up often ? 
  personally i would think of sigur ros , comedian majors and banking . 
  although recently more as `` panama papers paradies '', 
  probably something along the lines of `` where hogwarts is '', 
  oh sure - probably at a tolerable level - which is less then 5 %, 
   blonde hair + blue eyes uuuuh - i would n't bet too much money on them not being stabbed ... just for a whole other reason though . 
  obviously , because west of portugal the closest european country is poland . 
  yes i do - cut my finger with a knife this very morning . 
  the absolute only very short period of time there is some resistance towards the system and a revolution-like movement happened in the history of germany .
