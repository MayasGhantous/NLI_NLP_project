  you really got that wrong - i #m pretty sure that everyone is happy the chinese bought that shitty airport . 
  btw - it 's the second one they bought . 
  ( they made a hilarious documentary there : http://www.parchim-international.com/ ) what is much more troublesome ( and is probably stopped soon ) is chinese buying kuka ( largest german robots-manufacturer ), 
   some nato members such as germany do not want to do anything im pretty sure there would be a united message or reaction - depending on the circumstances . 
  either way german would fulfill it 's duties - just because people on the street said `` nah - why fight for them '' does not mean treaties would be meaningless . 
  german fought in serbia too . 
  there is a european regulation for public tenders ... they should sue them . 
  ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/business/public-tenders/rules-procedures/index_en.htm ), 
  ... \u00a7 103 - '' insults against organs or representatives of foreign states '' ... you might have heard of it : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/14/obscure-german-law-angela-merkel-recep-tayyip-erdogan, 
  it was 270mn for 32000 ppl in 2013 . 
   `` it 's a disgrace that the state took money for holocaust survivors , but did n't give it to us , '' he told ynet, 
  still paying rent to survivors, 
   there is no turkey after erdogan . 
  this actually is a goebbels quote too ... referring to hitler obviously ... 
  the more `` heart-warming '' part of dna-results : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyaeqemt5ls, 
  well the icelanders are a `` very special breed '', 
   has to be bought thats one part of the story ( and yes low utilization is a reason they buy it in the first place ) - the other part is italys demand and mafias involvment . 
  long story short : a clusterfuck : http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-garbage-of-naples-how-the-mafia-helped-send-italy-s-trash-to-germany-a-681469.html, 
   a major eu policy is negotiated by merkel . 
  is it ? 
  it 's tusks job - and as far as i can see it he 's the one doing it . 
  besides - all countries have to vote for it ( incl . 
  the parliament ), 
  the cap accounts for 4-5bn . 
  take that away and you are at roughly 18bn gross ; 14bn net . 
  now you are at 9bn net . 
  why would it be less than 14bn ? 
  that is actually of no relevance to international trade-routes whatsoever ... 
  italy is actually exporting their trash to germany to some extend ... we just burn the stuff then . 
  really ? 
  besides the absolutely ridicoulesness of this : the results would probably look like at any other human being from europe - mixed . 
  for reference : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj6r3-tgc04, 
  soooo . . brexit confirmed ? 
  and ? 
  they wo n't deny anyone passage . 
   freedom of navigation does anyone pose a threat to something like this ? 
  why would china even think of denying this ? 
  how is this even a fight ? 
  95 % sure the euro will go down , because uncertainty always puts pressure on the currency . 
  that said it would probably also put pressure on the $ . 
  + no rebates in eea, 
  ... they still pay 550mn per year , bow to eu-regulations and have free movement ... and they got crude oil . 
  uk does not want to have the first - and the folks with oil are scots . 
   similar to these of norway that would be devastating ... pay in , no rebates , free movement ? 
  that would be a shitshow, 
  you are already usas official poodle . 
  ass ? 
  youb are right - . 
  it was a boeing 757 ( actually 2 different ones ) : https://www.planespotters.net/aviation_photos/search.php?reg=g-strx, 
  one has to wonder why they deny the refugees - after all those would be even more vulnerable to exploitation . 
  ( ... and now start to take a pun - it 's a joke ), 
   tried to rid us of a group of people that holds a lot of influence/power and an agenda on their hands that is a poster-boy sentence of anti-semitism ... 
  got it . 
  although i very much doubt that there would have been any other way to defeat germany . 
  the ideology and the fear of revenge were to strong . 
  not after 1943 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjuou63klpa, 
   i doubt that if germany was n't defeated that does not make sense . 
  if germany would not have been defeated the world would look quite different ... and obviously noone would have apologized for nothing . 
   arguing about who 's fault it is . 
  would happen either way ;-), 
  thats the old one , which was an airbus . 
  very mature ... cunt, 
   your comment does n't just serve as anti-semitism but degrades the memory of the holocaust it does neither - it critizes the israeli gouvernment and suggests an agenda by them . 
  one that is not completely unlikely . 
  it especially does not degrade the memory of the holocaust ( as i also explicitly stated ) - how would it ? 
   suprised you got 20 upvotes . 
  that actually kind of suprises me too - and i kind of fear to get applause from the wrong kind of people there . 
  it somehwat cooled down after this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaza_flotilla_raid, 
  all of your examples are illegal ... and again - none of these are inherently `` german values '' - these are values of a all western civilizations derived from the 18th century . 
  and also none of these do represent the majority of neither foreigners , immigrants nor refugees . 
  not being an asshole and a somehow tolerant , lawabiding human being is as much a european or a french or a polish value ... none of these are `` typical german '' culture, 
  while i reject the usage of a word like hordes ( these are no orcs ) , their behavior was obviously illegal and no development or understanding of `` values `` does change that . 
  therefore its irrelevant to this discussion . 
  none of those are particularly german . 
  most of them are guranteed by law . 
  and in no way did i imply to accept illegal behavior for the appeasement of foreigners . 
  as you altered and finally deleted your answer before - i will put it here . 
  it absolutely is not about `` jewish communities '' - it is ( and also my answer was ) regarding the official gouvernment standpoint . 
  and while noone should be allowed to marginalize the holocaust ( especially not as a german ) netanjahu knows its weight and leverage . 
  and netanjahu always has an agenda . 
  ( although only a low-level diplomat this story gives a glimpse into the agenda : http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.662962 ), 
  lidl the new apple confirmed ... ibanana 8, 
  let 's put it that way : * 30 years ago shopping at aldi/lidl was a social stigma * since 10 years ago shopping at aldi with your porsche is `` clever '' and shows `` the hybrid customer '' . 
  the `` middle class '' of supermarkets also vanished - kind of . 
  i know many people that shop at aldi/lidl and afterwards drive to the most expensive gourmet food shop to buy italian bacon , dry-aged steak and a bottle of bordeaux ( me included ), 
  that might sound biased - but i think by not recognizing it they also have the intention to keep the holocaust somehow `` the only real genocide '' . 
  just to make sure : there is no way to compare genocides ... the act itself is the most despicable action on the lowest moral scale - no way to discuss which one was worse ... 
  on a side note : could someone please share what `` german values '' are ? 
  to me there are several general values ( as protected by law ) and many regional traditions ( which i cant find endangered ) . 
  do n't you guys have supermarkets over there ? 
  or did they really hype up the whole thing ? 
  special offers ? 
  i do n't care if the augustiner is non-alcoholic, 
  it offers a lot of advantages - it 's not `` my idea '' . 
  if you google `` europe of regions '' you will find a lot of discussions . 
  as you asked for opinions :  the notion of identity by blood died long ago . 
  in 2016 germans will formally lay it to rest , and will take great pride in doing so . 
  i can absolutely full-heartedly and definitley sign these 2 sentences . 
  and here is one special take on the future of nations in europe : to transcend the idea of nations ( with borders , nationalism , flags etc ) you need another construct that especially in germany is very much there - regions . 
  people identify as a berliner , a bavarian , a swabian - and a european .
