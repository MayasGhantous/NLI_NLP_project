  the fact that you claim the majority `` does not believe in the concept `` might be true ... but its just illogical to complain about missing influence when the intention is to abolish the whole thing . 
  on a side note : very balanced and serious discussion in here . 
  thanks fellow europeans !, 
  because you do n't want to ... 
  nice docu about this : paxman in brussels : https://youtu.be/pd4ssfq_nwg, 
   a position of power he has quite some power , much more than the german head of state eg . 
  he could do a 95 % hindenburg ... 
  haha uk, 
  they did not exist then . 
  their former parent company produced zyklon b though . 
   you should also put your money where your mouth is and boycott us goods and services . 
  why should i ? 
  i do n't necessarily have something against the us - but i fucking hate the hypocrisy involved whenever someone like you speaks up and says something along the `` muh we fund their military '' . 
  it 's an easy calculation : you want influence ? 
  pay for it - or go back to that `` isolationism '' . 
  ca n't have the cake and eat it . 
  do n't pretend you keep all those military infrastructure over here `` for the sake of european people '' . 
  it serves a very real self-interest . 
  * the us operates drones in jordan ... for which they need the ramstein base ... * the us has over 5.000 deployed troops in northern iraq ... flewn in over ramstein airbase ... and if they `` spain an ankle '' they get flown back to ? 
  landstuhl hospital ... * and again ... israel was supplied over ramstein ... which would be repeated if necessary . 
  on a final note - just close down the damn thing ... most germans would welcome that . 
   there are no drone bombs in jordan https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/02/25/reaper-drones-revealed-operating-jordan/  there are no more ( troops in iraq ) http://time.com/4298318/iraq-us-troops-barack-obama-mosul-isis/  toops in europe do n't do that . 
  ( supply israel ) http://www.palestine-studies.org/jps/fulltext/38298 ( `` for a while the american ramstein air base in western germany was the major european staging area for the american resupply effort to israel , as well as the schweinfurt base in bavaria . '' ), 
  it might help to switch off foxnews from time to time ... it 's kind of a bubble ... 
   we no longer want to age useless wars in the me , so force projection from europe is a relic of the past . 
  oh sure ... the us has absolutely no interests anymore to feel the need to : * support israel * supply troops in iraq * threaten iran * drone-bomb jordan and pakistan * protect the oman base * protect saudi-arabia * support the seal teams 6,8 * intervene in lybia * ... tbc maybe in 100 years ... 
  up to the 23th june 2016 ... ;-) on a more serious not : especially at border regions this is completely normal . 
  in germany especially around the luxembourg/german border and the swiss/german border . 
  tricky thing : you need to document the fact that you stay < 180d/year at your place of residence to get taxed where you work and not where you live ( relevant for swiss/german construct eg ), 
  the missile shield is to support your defence industry . 
  the reasons to build that started from `` saddam could send scuds to europe `` to `` russias expansion `` . 
  there are no major countries in support besides the border countries wanting to be supportive to the us ... subtlety convinced ... and as i said brexit would be too much instability . 
   so we can fuck off you do not want that . 
  eliminating the presence of us bases in eu would fundamentally hinder the option of force projection . 
  this is not a question of a random tank group or some a-10s , but a question of central logistics and intelligence hubs like ramstein . 
  ramstein serves not the purpose of `` protecting europe '' , but as a central hub for supply , drone commands , intelligence relay station , general command and so on ... you do not want to close down that one - that 's a myth . 
   wants a strong europe as i said - to the point it would be an opposing force . 
  the worlds largest economic bloc could suddenly pressure it 's own rules , set it 's own values ( and enforce them ) and would not obey foreign rules . 
  the rejection of something like `` safe harbour-agreement '' is just a glimpse into that future . 
  with or without ttip , things like `` buy american act '' would not be acceptable , if you want to make business in eu . 
   splitting europe up over trivial issues does nothing for the us . 
  depends . 
  they want a stable europe - but a weak one , which wo n't oppose them too much . 
  brexit would leave the eu too weak . 
  a united europe too strong . 
  did i really need a / s ? 
  that could lead to an interesting discussion . 
  3 brothers - one of them born in germany , 2 in turkey . 
  all grown up in germany . 
  one of them got a german passport , 2 a turkish one . 
  all three probably do not care too much about which passport they own . 
  no problem in `` sharing '' the success , although it started on german soil . 
  it 's like fatih akin . 
  it 's an example of how the melting of cultures brings up someone that transcends the concept of nationalism ... in this spirit i gladly share the success ( ... `` mine '' very relative here ), 
  the austrian hindenburg ... 
  they did n't call the iron curtain `` anti-fascist wall '' for nothing, 
   with as little external trade as possible did n't you achieve this one already ? 
  unsure if the bad pr outweights the relative market share gain by buyng them . 
  the stock plunged already - and they would need to finance that merger by putting out new stock . 
  btw : the glyphosat discussion ( round-up ) is additionally bad timing . 
   venezuala , they do n't really hurt anyone i think they pretty much hurt their own population massively, 
  the axis ... : * germany ; 15 ( 69pts ) * japan ; 16 ( 69pts ), 
  the cryengine ( from crytek ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cryengine, 
  not over here ... 
  cmon old friend from the land of il duce and d'annunzio, 
  we prbably told you so , when you bought them , have n't we ? 
  for reference : one reason asange is wanted for `` rape '' in sweden is because he `` forgot '' the condom - which is basically rape in sweden . 
  do n't push it swamp german . 
  you will beg on your knees to resettle when your sub-zero altitude country starts sinking . 
  probably already when the northern-euro will arise . 
  besides - we own your tanks ;-), 
   lieutenant hubert gruber hans landa would have been understood by more people i guess, 
  4th reich, 
  their interest rates on debt would spike hard ... very hard ... greek style hard . 
  and the euro would plunge - like apnoe deep dive hard . 
  for the interested : this is her at computerchaosclub conference : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvu94ye7km4 she is probably the most competent politician on this subject, 
  it 's because the missing speed limit - you can speed up the can to 300km/h + - out of sight , but still on the road . 
  `` questions asked '' ? 
  the gish of this articvle is to show you who really runs the game . 
  most likely those running the game are the ones the least likely to be even in the disucssions at parliament . 
  and though this shows some not-so-often mentioned influences by germany , it shows a very clear picture . 
  16/40 are german . 
  if you go on and google eg . 
  elmar brook , bernd lange or manfred weber you see how much influence they have . 
  the category `` big beast '' is n't called that for asking questions . 
   eib bonds mechanism btw - what prerequisites exist for that one ? 
  would n't the greek themselves have to come up with projects for it ? 
  did this happen/does it happen ? 
  just curious, 
   it 's charter requires repayment for one very specific reason and the ecb is n't allowed to forgive debt ... and the efsf/emf is n't either ... all the debt holders are not allowed to do so . 
  that ( and because 2017 is an election year in germany ) sch\u00e4uble `` hinted '' at a debt relief in 2018 . 
   it 's always germans who seem to bring up the moral hazard argument . 
  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6a94fed4-a98d-11e0-a04a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz495nl4e56 ( ( c ) a brit ) http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/06/19/draft-the-imf-greece-and-the-argentina-option/the-moral-hazard-in-greece ( ( c ) a greek ) ... but as we probably agree on most parts - it remains a question of the institutions . 
  so while the iwf insists on it 's money and at the same time telling everyone else should reduce debt : all of them seem inflexible . 
  the exsiting interest rates are quite close to a 0 % - loan . 
  but the `` greek marshall plan '' is nowhere in sight ... unsure if someone could start this, 
  `` in a speech in berlin on monday evening ( 28 november ) , polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski berated germany for its lack of action , with german chancellor angela merkel widely seen as holding the eurozone 's future in her hands . 
  `` i will probably be the first polish foreign minister in history to say so , but here it is : i fear german power less than i am beginning to fear german inactivity . 
  you have become europe 's indispensable nation . '', 
  easy - the value of the euro reflects the roi you could get by investing in it .
