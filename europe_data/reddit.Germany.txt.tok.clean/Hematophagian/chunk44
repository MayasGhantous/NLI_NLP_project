  the interest rates are close to zero , an investment in the eurozone probably has a low roi . 
  the dm would just reflect germanys roi - probably quite similar to the swiss franc ... and now you do a google search for the chf/eur rate over the last 3 years ... 
  actually the only one `` bullied '' into that was germany ... 
   i 'm telling you , as an economist , it 's a structural adjustment . 
  ok . mayb i did phrase that wrong . 
  i think your `` eli5 '' ( or eli16 ) example does not work because it neglects the moral hazard involved . 
  i give you the fact that it is in fact a `` structural adjustment '' - so is getting rid of rampant tax evasion and corruption . 
  the comparison to the coal just does not work here - because `` going on using cioal '' is not valid , as they probably just cant export it anymore ( and probably the regulations coming with it make it not a valid business modell anymore ) . 
  so now we have a needed `` structural reform '' - if you counter this by just allocating new ressources to an unfit system the comparison would be `` just subsidies coal for west virgina '' - we probably both agree that this is not a working approach either . 
   it 's actually a far more brutal adjustment when compared to the coal example . 
  still i refuse the comparison . 
  in your coal/west virginia there is nothing that could have done to reduce/stop the effect . 
  but saying `` artificial low interest rates '' are somehow a `` market disruption and a thing coming upon us '' is not acceptable . 
  it 's like saying : `` mom went away and the cookie jar was open - now you have stomach crumps , because you eat them all '' . 
  that is not what i accept as a `` structural adjustment '', 
  if you wan na have a fun read : http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/10/greeks-bearing-bonds-201010 and we as germans hate theo waigel for it - he should have seen the greek numbers were a fixed game : http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/interview/waigel-eu-should-have-questioned-greece-s-budget-figures-much-sooner/ ( hint : he should have seen it too ), 
  while i like your explanation it seems to be fundamentaly wrong at one point : greek did never have the need of a `` structural adjust '' . 
  no coal vanished , no major income streams changed ... besides the phenomenal piling of further debts and the systemic tax evasion . 
  ( oh - and i think the oil industry did acutally increase ), 
  http://www.zeit.de/1967/23/auf-fuenf-mach-acht-milliarden they threw all together - but as a tl ; dr : we did not repay the whole sum . 
  as of now - few refugees work - they just cause cost ... and the weak euro causes around 20 % of the surplus of germany ... 
   which germany completly payed back with interests in time thats actually incorrect . 
  but the sum was n't that large - nonetheless this debt was forgiven . 
  still working on that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taurus_cattle, 
  alsace-lorraine ... you still got a chance to come back ;-), 
  east germany ... rebuilding it since centuries . 
  have fun south korea !, 
  uhhh waht are the gun laws in poland ? 
  anyone can own a machine gun ? 
  or are the militias just a `` special group '' excempted ? 
  european court did mandate that, 
  main question is what was worse ? 
  on or off ? 
  if you would need to staff 10 extra people just for cleaning up the shit-show happening below you might just safe the money ... 
  you forgot boko ( haram ), 
  i thought we get shit because we suspended that one ? 
  now because we remind everyone that it still exists ? 
  while i cant see the relevance - it is probably true ... divide and conquer, 
   poland tried to take media to its hands so democracy became invalid to the western powers because only through media they can keep their leash on european people . 
  this is not a sentence ... but anyway - the polish are probably the master of `` aligning media with party interest '', 
   a crisis that 's a result of america 's attempt to bring democracy in the middle east . 
  that is too simple . 
  it 's as good as saying `` sykes-picot '' and the english are to blame ( as much true as the first one ), 
  and constant complaining either way . 
  i know ... 
  we should only allow preachers from morocco to preach . 
  read up on their system - they installed kind of a `` certified non-extremist '' education : http://www.forbes.com/sites/abdelmalekalaoui/2015/03/31/why-morocco-wants-to-become-a-major-islamic-training-hub/#7b53336d17cc, 
  that may make sense , but it probably depends very much on `` where from '' . 
  the eritrean might work like you describe - the syrian ( probably coming from a former middle class ) will seek the same opportunities the former natives would . 
  that is a stupid comment - whatever your opinion is . 
  * sample size : 947 * margin of error : 4.3 percentage points, 
   the conflict is much more complex and still you agree with as easy explanations as `` her fault '', 
  probably the last one - he is 95 ... 
  i usually just link here - best comment about the topic : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/, 
  no - newspaper publishes an opinion piece by a moron , who bases his assumptions on easy `` still nazis '' - arguments and cheap propaganda , reminding me ( again ) why i just like to see an end to the on-going unwillingness of the uk in europe to engage and work towards a common goal . 
  also - just want to see the result of this experiment - to end all discussions . 
  `` the grid '' has to sell it x-borders . 
  at a negative price . 
   after all , if frau merkel had not last year unilaterally thrown open the doors of europe to the entire third world then the migration crisis would not be a crisis . 
  again - all of it her fault it seems ... 
  that does not make sense - as the native inhabitants would be on welfare too without jobs ... 
   it 's not war we should fear , but what the germans do in peace . 
  i feel kind of insulted . 
  and again - just leave , close door behind you . 
  france, 
  hitting a break in a train is pushing a button/releasing a lever - especially if it 's an emergency brake . 
  so he probably hit the big red button - train goes to max . 
  brake , he sees that he wo n't make it and starts running . 
  it 's not like he had to put the foot on the brake ... 
  kind of confused . 
  is n't a minimum wage enforced now ? 
  as far as i understand anyone working in germany must be paid at least the minimum wage - no matter where he comes from . 
  even the truck drivers, 
  in 2021 it might be spahn against maas ... maybe, 
   as a filipino citizen you do need a visa to travel to switserland . 
  switzerland = schengen ; visa = schengenvisa ... 
  germany ? 
  hitler was a great politician ... 
  i think the chances to change jobs increased quite a bit in germany over the years . 
  the comments on the page contiously praise the german reforms from back in the 2000s ( hartz iv ) , and while as a german i can see how we profit from these to this day , they are far from ideal . 
  i remember sarkozy going all `` let 's do what the germans did '' and then receiving backslash after backslash . 
  what 's the discussion today ? 
  is the german way still seen as valid ? 
  or is it just seen as a wrong way ? 
  if so - just for ideology-reasons ? 
  the eu is more often than not quite transparent and open with their publications ... one just has to go to their website and read it ( ... ok finding it is also a task ), 
   i 'm also really surprised all of this is coming from van der leyen . 
  not always the worst idea, 
  there are 72 which are part of the contract . 
   the eu agreed to visa free access after meeting all prerequisites ... 
  thats exactly what happened . 
  and the banks had a haircut . 
  problem : all of that happened before this drama and everyone forgot . 
  in before its brexit, 
  you want an entry at / r/shitamericanssay ? 
  because thats how to get one . 
  to answer your question : noone will deal with him - he wo n't win . 
  probably with her father though, 
  he is called drumpf over here - maybe heard that name ? 
  actually it would be easy to `` sell '' ttip : * leave out the `` sensible '' stuff , like french supporting their culture , germans fixing book prices , us subsidising some agriculture * fix the `` controversial '' stuff : labeling for champagne , etc.
