  let the us do an `` champagne-style '' - label and an `` idaho-mozarella '' . 
  keep up the same standards as before / maybe introduce `` punitive damage lawsuits '' in eu too . 
  * agree on the common sense stuff : align the turn signals/or do not regulate them . 
  * turn down the weird stuff : sue the countries before public courts - if need be introduced newly as a `` neutral court '' somewhere . 
  on 10th may 1945 for sure ... 
  have a vodka, 
  the funny thing most do not realize is the fact , that eu companies would also start suing the shit out of the us . 
  * car companies cant sell directly to customers ? 
  sue that * hfcs subsidised vs. sugar ? 
  not much longer * `` buy american '' act ? 
  i do n't think so * `` champagne '' is any bubble water containing alcohol ? 
  let 's see, 
  / r/worldnews more nuanced discussion than / r/europe ... must be a first ... 
  who defines `` being german '' ? 
  if you ask me that attribute holds not much value . 
  i do not define myself by being '' born in a place '' or being `` raised in a system '' . 
  i just stated a fact . 
  he got citizenship ... so he 's at least around for 8years +, 
  which is also wrong . 
  most of the waste is stored on-premise . 
  the waste going to gorleben , the `` would-be '' storage place is actually stored outside above earth . 
  most waste is stored on-premise of nuclear power stations ... this is far from `` permanent '', 
   french prices , which already factor decommissioning costs for the records . 
  that 's what they said in germany too ... now when the time comes they are several bn short . 
  ca n't see that - most of the major conservative parties across europe are in the epp in european parliament ( exept the tories ) , and they tick pretty much alike : http://www.eppgroup.eu/, 
  on a side note : whenever someone says `` leftist german media '' , i ca n't help but wonder who that might be . 
  the biggest media companies are clearly conservative/right-leaning media : axel springer grp bertelsmann grp only `` slightly left '' is spiegel ( self-owned ) and zeit ( self-owned ) . 
  none of them has a foreign holding . 
   relative peace from 1815 to 1914 boy ... you must actually live in cuba . 
  the two major conflicts were 1870/71 - which actually lead to german unification and the krim war 1853/56 . 
  both wars were quite large , and the krim war especially nasty . 
  you didn #t burn down riaa either , right ? 
  that works in france , because the `` other guy '' is from one of the big parties . 
  in austria the `` other guy '' is a green , probably someone arguing he is `` just as radical '' , only on the other side of the spectrum . 
  ( especially concernig the refugee situation ), 
   bought nearly 2 years for stalin to prepare/upgrade the red army a time he used to sack the majority of his generals and officers ... and at the day it was broken and hitler declared war on russia , he was n't able to leave his bed for a week being shocked by the news and fearful of further plots to kill him ... stalin defeated hitler - not much doubt about it . 
  but i wonder what would have happened if he was n't forced to do so ... 
  so hofer gets president , dissolves parliament and stracher wins ? 
  that 's the plan now ? 
  the `` macht\u00fcbernahme '' ? 
  * orders from overseas clients rose by 4.3 percent in march as demand for german goods increased by 1.1 percent across the eurozone , and by 6.2 percent in non-euro-area foreign countries . 
  * surplus you mean ... and selling to china is actually a plus sum game for all of europe . 
  the rise does not come from inside eu - so it 's not much good to argument the `` germany strangling italian industry '', 
  probably short of marie lepen , but the general direction seems obvious . 
  party < -  electorate, 
  at least you can do it all by yourself this time . 
  and tell this strache guy he should not try to get a german citizenship . 
  we declined this 3 times for this painter guy back then before we faltered - this time he wo n't get it !, 
  all the best , yours sincerely hindenburg, 
  referendum ? 
  probably not . 
  discussion ? 
  probably thousands . 
  you ca n't just `` wave it through '' national parliaments . 
  btw - neither through us congress , which already opposes it ... so there is a good chance the us themselves scrap the thing . 
   now we have to read leaks about it im far from promoting ttip , but the text is n't finished yet - probably far from it . 
  so not too much sens in examining it now ... 
   prove me wrong about something that might happen in the future ? 
  prove yours right first ... 
  as it seems `` not too far fetched '' that he was from the other side of the pond , . 
  just let me remind everyone of the most embarassing thing someone could do with sculptures in foreign countries : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/us-student-rescued-giant-vagina-sculpture-germany, 
  thanks obama !, 
  they do n't own the rights to `` beethoven '' but most likely to barenboim conducting it . 
  not that this is a good thing - but just to clarify why they are allowed to `` disagree '' and youtube blocks it . 
  it may not `` work as intended '' , may be unsustainable and may be disruptive to the system - but to call it `` theft '' does obviously not go well with a german . 
  first for some hiostory and `` public opinion '' : * from a germans perspective the euro was forced on us ( which is correct ) . 
  * most of germans will tell you `` we were very happy with the deutschmark and it worked '' ( which is partially correct - at least the surplus was there before the euro - but most would agree that the euro favoured the surplus . 
  many would agree it is responsible for 20-30 % of the surplus ) . 
  * then there is the redistribution via eu funds : `` we pay almost 15bn per year to the eu ! '', 
  ( as you stated already - this is just a part of what would be necessary - then again , not one `` receiver-country '' was very solid and sound with their use of eu funds - so there is that quite understandable `` mistrust '' ) so what to do now ? 
  the german electroate has a hard-om about the balanced budget - especially as everyone knows that this ca n't go on for ever and we can see what happens if it 's not working out . 
  at the same time the euro-bonds idea just does not go well with germans , for again obvious reasons . 
  and god-forbid germans economy would struggle again - not good for noone . 
  cutting taxes and especially putting money in infrastructure projects would work - but would italy , greece profit from it ? 
  what could greece export to germany to turn this around ? 
  finally : the most surplus does actually derive from exports to countries outside of the eu ... which makes this discussion somehow `` short sighted '' . 
  the most likely countries to profit from a german expenditure spree would probably also be outside europe ... ps : one last point : tell me one other country that would go along and say : sure - it 's our sweet spot - let 's give money to everyone else '' ... 
  someone tell me what to do with 70bn per year . 
  or as gabriel put it : `` i would n't know where to put those aircraft carriers ... ``, 
  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ), 
  or freud for adhs, 
  my thought exactly, 
   is germany a russian lapdog ? 
  besides the morale it is an export nation that lost 20bn trade volume with russia . 
  i kind of misspelled the title . 
  today 150yrs ago he delivered the manuscript to his publisher . 
  sorry , german only, 
  i wonder what he would have thought , if he would have foreseen stalin . 
   this should explain why germany 's position in the european union is so dominant . 
  politically , of course , everyone is equal , but in terms of money and economic potential , the germans in the union weigh as many as 19 other states combined . 
  so you are saying it 's unfair towards germany ? 
  funny guy ... remember when he lost his cat ? 
  what is it about this university ? 
  the only positions i hear are either `` oh my god the last bastion of free thinking '' vs. `` to hell with soros-financed agenda '' . 
  which is it ? 
  would prefer some balanced insight . 
  anyone ? 
  i wonder if there is anything that the ecb is allowed to buy ... ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html ), 
  https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates , , , just saying, 
   end of ** hypothetical ** story .
