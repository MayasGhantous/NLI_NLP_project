  ftfy, 
   ~ 84 % of warsaw was reduces to rubble during the war . 
  the record in germany holds pforzheim though . 
  90 % destroyed inner city , highest building 60cm ... 
  it 's not common knowledge ... but as it is my hometown i know it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_pforzheim_in_world_war_ii, 
  there was a very nice overview of that from a redditor : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?st=j16jlei6&amp;sh=16c7115f, 
  faq on cnb website https://www.cnb.cz/en/faq/exit_from_the_exchange_rate_commitment, 
  that 's something all of europe should have done , correct . 
  but describing merkel as the only pull factor is greatly distorting reality . 
   merkel encouraged this by setting up an obstacle course that is the most ridiculous confusion about cause and effect that could possibly fit in a brits brain , right ? 
  he seems really desperate . 
  what happens if he looses the referendum ? 
  additional violence ? 
  weidman objects the qe since it came up the first time . 
  since then he could been ignored , because everyone overrules him - but obviously the sentiment to stop qe gets more traction now . 
  as of now none . 
  but uk needs to setup their rules and the eu needs to accept them as equivalent . 
  probably correct . 
  it 's just funny how far they came from shooting down a jet to being `` best buddies '' . 
  no moral grounds ... at all, 
  it 's an older story though : https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/world/europe/what-brexit-means-for-pet-travel.html?_r=0, 
   which is why right wing parties are gaining everywhere . 
  the afd is actually declining ... and fast . 
  so your `` opinion '' is a sentiment at best , a falsehood at least . 
  base your arguments on facts ... might help . 
  why should i ? 
  you posted numbers without source - i did with source ... 
  6 oil companies stock and people ? 
  that 's not summing up to 28bn ... 
   obviously millions are not . 
  they can raise their voices each election . 
  you know that this democracy thing is a majority-based idea , right ? 
  any other country wanted it ? 
  with a 90 % chance i would guess edit : you all can rise your comments and opinions . 
  right now , she is leading the polls ( or to be more precise : her party is ) , and there are no valid alternatives , besides a hard left-leaning coalition ( which obviously would ease the regulations on migration immediately ) , which wo n't win the election ... even with the schulz-train . 
  simply downvoting is like ignoring the truth . 
   democratic legitimation we do not have a direct democracy . 
  next stop : 24.9.2017 national election . 
  uuuh - which sectors do have sanctions on imports ? 
  dutch - german one in a short video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vog4mzygvuw hint : only on major soccer events ... which wo n't happen that often in the coming years ... 
  the status itself is only for one year - with an option for 2 additional years . 
  the restrictions on bringing family are also temporary ( 16.3.2018 ) . 
  it 's a `` wait and see '' - approach , as so often with merkel . 
  in this case i would agree with her though . 
  on a side note : to get one of those visas , the family needs to apply at an embassy . 
  the closest to syria are those in beirut and in turkey . 
  waiting times for an appointment at the german embassy in beirut are now at 10-12 months ... https://service2.diplo.de/rktermin/extern/choose_category.do?locationcode=beir&amp;realmid=320&amp;categoryid=1208, 
  as long as they want to have a `` transitional deal '' they need to adhere to the echr/ecj ... because otherwise there would not be the option to enforce the rules . 
  may somehow realized this too some weeks ago ... so she backtracks here . 
   do you really tell me that there is a higher chance a woman would be raped or starve to death in a journey through turkey to eu , than in a fucking war zone ? 
  yes . 
  besides : one of the reasons the male flee first is they would get drafted otherwise . 
  glad you voice does not cause troops moving ... you seem like a strategic genius . 
  the logic of the much higher chances , that a women and her kid would probably get raped on the trail , drown more easy in the ocean , or just starve to death ... 
  obviously me - by paying taxes . 
  and hey , guess what ? 
  i 'm ok with it . 
  almost all new refugees ( incl . 
  syrians ) receive a `` subsidary protection '' denying them to bring their families . 
  because they send the strongest with the highest chance to survive the journey . 
   ompare this to germany who has so much trade , the russian sanctions are n't hurting that much . 
  the ( more or less ) official numbers for germany are : trade with russia 2014 : 38bn 2016 : 20bn while russia is not the most important trading partner - almost halving the trade by 20bn is hurting . 
  the us is far less exposed to those effects . 
  and quite busy ... : * 2012 : 7 * 2013 : 8 * 2014 : 3 * 2015 : 3 * 2016 : 3, 
  besides the measurement issues i would n't have been surprised , if the country would have been `` turkey '' ... 
  the european-slaves have bordeaux-coloured ones . 
  and it was changed from blue to bordeaux . 
  now first a foreign regime forced the change , and second the name of the colour is french , ... 
  if i did understand the brexiteers wrong - feel free to correct me there ;-), 
  i was - have you been ? 
  for the interested : http://www.numov.org/praesentationen/delegation-solar-libya/dr-gerhard-seifert-solar-valley_territorial-innovation-clusters.pdf `` territorial innovation clusters strategies and practices in the solarvalley cluster of excellence '', 
  yes, 
  pc-police ? 
   the island was formally ceded to italy in 1923 , and on 12 october 1943 it was occupied by the nazis . 
  [ 12 ] at the end of world war ii , the surrender of german forces in the region took place on symi to the british and the island was subject to three years of occupation by them as a result . 
  [ 13 ] symi was finally rejoined with greece in 1948 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symi, 
  been there , done that - overrated ... 
   or we allow countries to impose restrictions ( which would likely end the eu ) . 
  to influence this trend you would need to hinder people from leaving ... because the big ones sure as hell wo n't stop them from coming . 
  after german reunification there were several strategies to `` rebuild '' th east . 
  first they tried to just spread the support ( besides some highlight projects on infrastructure ) . 
  they soon realized that this would not work out . 
  so they defined `` clusters '' to prop up , mostly around one industrial niche . 
  so they started a tech-sector close to dresden ( with an amd r&d facility ) and the `` solar valley '' . 
  it worked significantly better - but both also fall mostly apart ( the pressure on both niches overwhelmed the fragile set-up ) . 
  at the end the saying goes `` the devil always shits on the biggest pile '' to this day munich has the most major company hqs , while berlin has exactly 1 . 
  they split the world ... like puma and adidas , or charlesmagne , or portugal and spain ... 
  harder than in germany i would assume .

  was n't it superman on a low-altitude pass ? 
  double post, 
  you are so bad at framing this answer , it hurts . 
  the pure fact that you try to argue for the sake of arguing make me cringe . 
  this is war you playing with you little islander . 
  one does not play with the concept , the idea or even the thought if not absolutely necessary . 
  so stop lowering the bar so deep you just keep emberassing yourself . 
   nothing is risk free . 
  you do not understand investing , do you ? 
  in former times you could go to an insurance company pay a monthly budget and have let 's say 2-3 % interest .
