  he has n't anything to prove anymore , doing the job sitting in a wheelchair is n't too much fun either , and he is 74 now . 
  after he was shot and kohl went down politically his chances to become chancellor declined - with merkel being `` longtime emperor '' to finally zero . 
  which on the other hand make him almost completely independant . 
  he is the most powerful minister - no decision influencing the budget will happen against his will , he ca n't be pushed . 
  the `` being frugal '' is a mixture of his values ( swabian ... ) , the will of the electorate and his true believes in a somehow keynesian economic theroy . 
   and it 's not french , which makes it a non-starter hehe ... yeah forgot about that one ;-) should have been the first and last argument there . 
   it 's that code for expecting the euro to blow up ? 
  not really - it 's more along the ( keynes ) lines `` the money saved during the good time could be spent during the bad times . '', 
  and having a balanced budget was one of the major promises of him ... so he defends it like a tiger mom . 
  the `` black zero '' balance is sacred ... and to be honest : as the interest rates are in fact negative for now , those debts could become very pricey when refinancing later on in a `` less absurd '' world of interest rates . 
  yeah - a lot of people in germany tried to convince sch\u00e4uble of that logic too ... to no avail . 
  jus sanguinis ... which european countries do have the same logic regarding citizenship ? 
  next step : no more foreign financing for imams . 
  kreta could meet the requirements , would n't it ? 
  try lugana, 
  lets hate lichtenstein ... they got no army, 
  probably cleared ypk country and let isis pass the borders ... 
  might want to upgrade from those 80s model ... if we allow it ;-), 
  absolutely - but i would bet money on a reintroduction in turkey . 
  safer bet than him getting president for life, 
  absolutely , they can not get hold of according routes , therefore they just `` bought '' airberlin . 
  the first to mumble `` eurobonds '' will be chastised !, 
  it definitley opened him a look into the future ... imagine no more spare parts for the tanks ... 354 leopardii , 397 leopardi, 
  the rule is actually to target the expansion of arabian airlines , like etihad . 
  they would ruin the market with the enourmous subsidies they get back in uae . 
  denmark creeping upwards to us ... 
  hey why do n't you meet halfway for a coffee break ? 
  ... * runningoffstage *, 
  ah ... lazy me - thx !, 
  is the klm serving inner-uk routes ? 
  and btw - is n't ryanair still a eu company , or did they move to the uk ? 
   provoked into a negative response . 
  behind closed doors the responses probably have been very clear ... even if we shut down any weapon exports his leopard-tanks probably fall apart sooner then later . 
  the good enough reason would be reintroduction of death penalty . 
  that 's when the eu-process has to end by default ... and the perfect moment to kick them out of the eu customs union ... then no more sanctions are needed ... turkey will fall like a stone . 
  ah i hear mr. `` ottoman empire '' speak ... 
  are you for real ? 
  and today all further akp events in germany stopped ... honi soit qui mal y pense . 
  nah ... it 's called `` erwin rommel `` room, 
  2017 will see an extended bear market . 
  the stock market is a powder keg . 
  one external disruptive event , trump doing shit , isis doing shit , china doing shit and it will come down . 
  mark my words ... 
  point missed ... 
   i would want to see the results of an european wide referendum where people can choose between `` no free movement '' , `` western europe only '' and `` absolute free movement '' oh what a wonderous time we live in , where such things as survey do actually exist ... : http://lartsocial.org/fog-channel-what-do-eu-27-nations-think-about-freedom-movement although not precisley you ( somewhat xenophobic ) question , but more interesting it splits into `` has right to live '' and `` has right to work '' . 
  both questions are big on the `` i agree '' - numbers ... besides uk ... who would have thought ? 
  did the text change with every translation ? 
  in german he also says `` ihr trinkt doch kaltes wasser nach dem onanieren '' ( you people drink cold water after masturbation ), 
  i was there when visiting rome . 
  it is also located in a shitty area , while the munich one is right in the center on a prime location . 
  its the vw stock ... 
  that happened, 
  absolutely !, 
  see you next month !, 
  as an inhabitant of italys northermost city ( munich ) , i urge you to visit the halls of http://www.eataly.net/de_de/geschaefte/muenchen/, 
  its called risk diversification ... as of now the us is a risk . 
  me neither , and no there are only a few . 
  but in murica de just get more and more defunded ... 
  his proposal is in the text ... also i do n't know who besides him would call it a `` proposal '' :  he has long opposed germany 's federalist model of closer european political integration , arguing instead for reforms that would decentralise the bloc by granting greater powers to member states . 
  not mine : https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/17/club-med-countries-spoiled-eurozone-party, 
  do not feed the trolls ... 
  afraid of success of others ... 
  that 's not so obvious for club med, 
  yes is ok with me ... after a common fiscal/tax policy . 
  quite elaborate comment - public school ? 
  axis of good ( s ), 
  sure it does ... in a world like these this would be moral armageddon ... borrowing frenzy as noone has been seen . 
  uuuuuh ... how about no ? 
  it does not mention `` births '' - only `` increase in population '' - so yes it includes all forms of `` increasing population '', 
  because we experienced what patriotism in overdrive can look like and we are in the middle of a process becoming european patriots ... hopefully . 
  take the tinhat off ... 
  one of those mighty influential 2nd row european politicians . 
  only open question is currency . 
  pound ? 
  scottish groat ? 
  euro ? 
  `` am i already on ? '', 
  noone told you ... but `` wolfenstein '' is called `` wolfenstein '' in the netherlands ... point proven, 
  evil nazi castles, 
  damit - linked sputnik ... 
  so hungary is another `` special snowflake '' : http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/2016/01/21/hungary-eyes-russian-helicopters-despite-sanctions/79105402/ again : i assume the s400 would be on a new level ... and i 'm genuinley curious if they may have a `` hidden switch '' to turn them off remotley . 
  even if not the us would most likely be singled out - neither good . 
  hmmm - it 's a real thing in germany sanctioned by all the parties involved . 
  wikiepdia actually has a dutch article about one of your services - is n't it `` good '' ? 
  wait ... a ( probably ) turkish hacker posts turkish propaganda to influence a turkish vote ? 
  which is the second country ? 
  da fuck is this piece of propaganda coming from a medieval country ? 
  i thought they post first election surveys at 21:00 ? 
  should n't be allowed to vote afterwards , or not ? 
  is n't there an online-service where you answer/rate 20-30 questions and it gives you a recommendation ? 
  dutch complaining about bikes ... come on - this stereotyping next level - you wan na complain about squeaking clogs ? 
  it may also be overcompensated because the euro fell ( the fed strengthened the $ ), 
  but but ... that was our almost glorious and only attempt to do such thing !, 
  : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_revolutions_of_1848%e2%80%9349, 
  i heard they all became nazis now...neo-nazis they call it . 
  i always wonder when thedonalds account will be hacked the first time ... and then all hell will break loose . 
  honestly - baring people from a voting booth seems the most undemocratic behaviour of all . 
  and just to remind everyone : for ( eg ) germany the % for erdogan by turks voting in germany exceeded the turkish average . 
  funnily enough it 's actually not ... or just slightly . 
  it did rise on a weekly basis , and just had a small dent today ... : http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=eur&amp;to=try&amp;view=1w,
