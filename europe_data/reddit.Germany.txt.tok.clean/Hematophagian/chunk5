  anytime else it was an absolut local thing . 
  germans : buying train tickets before demonstrating on the platform . 
  wo n't deny the sweet spot we are in ... makes most of us more tolerant too . 
  a germany in disarray is not favourable ... 
   if britain has isolated itself europe it 's only because the rest of europe has allowed it to happen `` i only had sex with your best friend because you do n't give me as much attention as i deserve '' ... 
  kill one person = murderer . 
  kill a million = hero ( ... for 12 years ), 
  we tried an alternative government system , so the rest of the world does not have to do it ... now everyone knows : fascism = bad . 
  on a side note : it can be argued that fascism was invented by an [ italian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabriele_d%27annunzio ) . 
  ingolstadt , where the beer purity law was introduced 500yrs ago : https://youtu.be/y_bwbh2nq74, 
  neither is really that german nor can i see an iron cross . 
  ~ ~ projected : 0.25 ~ ~ ~ ~ achieved : 0.7 ~ ~ ~ ~ difference : 0.45 ... or `` nearly 1 percent '' ~ ~ apparently i 'm the stupid one - yes it 's close to 1 %, 
  vitamine b-12 and iron are either non-available ( vegan -  b-12 ) or insufficent ( -  iron ) for vegans . 
  vegetarians have to balance what they eat , but especially b-12 is mostly found in non-vegetarian food . 
  this is an african tribe still doing `` persistence hunting '' ... just run it down over 30 miles and the deer collapses : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826hmloie_o, 
  i recently read this fine statement : `` wait , till the world comes independent of oil , and water is the new oil . 
  only then will you see how the middle east can turn into armageddon . '', 
  hey boris - your assumption is wrong . 
  california did absolutely accept the rules of washington dc, 
  so you propose `` no tax on companies '' ? 
  you get paid for these kind of posts ? 
  * that we had a primary surplus of 0.7 percent instead of the projected 0.25 percent primary deficit . 
  that is to say that we exceeded the programme 's target by nearly 1 percent . 
  * impressive - nonetheless calculating is ' t his stong side . 
  * we kept expenditure low , we gave a breath of fresh air to the economy by exploiting the eu 's national strategic reference framework that gave over five billion euros to the greek economy and greece was , for the first time , the number one country in absorbing those funds . 
  * that 's not exploiting - that 's how it should be . 
  not directly related , but interesting enough : the israeli air-force is the only `` western 1st world country '' that ever shot down a russian jet in air2air-combat : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_rimon_20, 
  it was part of the reunification agreement 2 +4 . 
   better menu than starbucks . 
  those remain starbucks - it 's franchising . 
  just like mcdonalds . 
  nothing will change . 
  honestly - i 'm all for preserving heritage - and this is heritage too . 
  but they should be thankful we did n't raze the monstrous thing : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_memorial_ ( treptower_park ) it 's not a graveyard . 
  i think the unmarried no children dinkys are on the rise too . 
  am one of them, 
  interia is not springer though . 
  but still : is this really an influential share that can stear public opinion ? 
  i thought something like gazeta wyborcza is the big thing . 
  they have exactly 2 newspaper ( fakt and newsweek ) that are not special intetest and 75 % of onet . 
  you wan na tell me that this is `` most '' ? 
  something reddit teached me recently ;-), 
  nick cave on blixa : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylnvh2741vs, 
  most might know him as part of `` nick cave & the bad seeds '' , although that part of his career is just a very small aspect : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcsadt6mmjq, 
  blixa bargeld to the rescue . 
  on a side note : this is the lead singer reading a hardware shops weekly advertising . 
  it was a commercial screened in tv - lil artsy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxcaqzaa06u&amp;list=pl2a34cb63231e4c55, 
  have an agenda much ? 
  salty ? 
  looking for someone to blame ? 
  right here ;-), 
  which banks ? 
  the big ones at london , or the ones in nyc ? 
  so where exactly has germany a unproportional vote ? 
  on unanimous decisions ? 
  au contraire . 
  seats/inhabitants in eu parliament are lower in bigger countries . 
  the headline is not at all what he said : ... would still ** benefit ** from the free-trade zone which currently stretches from iceland to the russian border , but we would n't have all of the eu regulations sure they somehow benefit being close the eu ... probably . 
  this is such a non-information . 
  one should mention different usage in different sorts of tea . 
  while in germany any herbal , tea , dried fruit is a `` tee '' you can confuse the hell out of a french ordering a `` mint tea '' and not an infusion . 
   if you think , that it 's because of some charity towards neighbouring countries learn macro-economics . 
  of course this is no charity . 
  it fucks everyone . 
  not only german workers , but especially anyone down the supply-chain - which happens to be mostly hungarian , czech and polish . 
  and their workers . 
  i gave you a `` complaining blue-print '' . 
  instead of blaming the high prices on low competition between retialers - blame it on the low net gain of german workers . 
  you will also see that this surpasses national interests since a long time now . 
  it 's corperations that could not give less about nations . 
  yes - this is a problem , although the major surplus comes from trading with outside of eu-partners . 
  nonetheless the trade deficit ger-es is also high . 
  one thing to counter this are direct investments - as happening already : german direct investment in spain : 391 mio euro spanish direct investment in germany : 22 mio euro . 
  and it definitley is not the major problem here . 
  on a side note : * vattenfall said it would sell its german lignite , or brown coal , business -- opencast coalmines and two power plants close to the german-polish border -- to czech operator eph . 
  * http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/18/vattenfall-exits-german-coal-unit-as-it-seeks-sustainable-energy, 
   break this low wages demand innovation and education are the ways to succeed here . 
  competitiveness, 
   neither stupid people , who gon na work for shity wages apparently this is exactly the problem : enough ppl . 
  that do work for shitty wages - otherwise the wages would not be so low . 
  see ? 
  that 's supply & demand effect . 
  germany is a highly competitive market - especially considering groceries . 
  and if you want to argue against `` germany '' you would take a completely different route : german real wage depression is a thing since years - and you have to follow thatb race to the bottom . 
  this circle ended more or less last year and will give neighbouring countries more `` breathing space '' . 
  what is it with you people ? 
  why is it `` the foreign evil power in brussels '' ? 
  as long as you do not realize that brussels is as much you then me , you just seem immature for the whole process of a union . 
  and why do people get triggered by a german flair ? 
  germany might be the one promoting austerity - but santander is not a german bank - and bankia was n't a particular german idea . 
  if you want to look for the culprit you could stop at your own banking system fuelling half-assed real estate projects . 
  you are not greece . 
  italian sometimes . 
  4th language is voluntary and if available can be choosen ( spanish or italian ) . 
  never saw polish . 
  why you know i wear a beard creepy man ? 
  french ... spanish/russian, 
   it is not a spanish law ?? 
  * based primarily on articles 121 and 126 [ 1 ] of the treaty on the functioning of the european union * it is a treaty everyone signed ... 
  any bubble is .
