  yeah - but we stopped fighting those borders ... while those arab ones made with a ruler ... and the african ones ... 
  if that was a `` crime against humanity '' is debatable though . 
  once horribly wrong , the other incident just slightly faster, 
   poland will pay more into common treasury than receive back i ca n't see you becoming a net payer in the coming decade , is that a common understanding in poland ? 
  may i support this suggestion to 50 % and ask the dutch not to vote for wilders too ? 
  the shop-owners , the hotel and restaurant-staff , the tourist guides , the cab drivers , the pool-boys ... they notice . 
  so 2 out of 5 are under investigation now , correct ? 
  being on the wrong side of history once makes one sensible ;-), 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sykes%e2%80%93picot_agreement?wprov=sfla1 this alone keeps us all busy, 
  read the history of uk colonialism ... or just watch ghandi, 
  fuse them shut - bore them open, 
  that opens an interesting question : next eu elections are 2019 ... do you think the uk will still vote ? 
  if so just for one year ? 
  good enough for the effect ... i used to begin my speeches to a project team that was `` slightly unwilling '' with these words ... anger will fit even more !, 
  budget fight seems unlikely for poland ... they will be the loser of any discussion about budget . 
  wait for the reduction of the eu budget after the uk left ... that will be a nice show . 
  that is actually a news to me - and stops me from making that joke now :-( in this case i will henceforth live my life more `` elevated '' as honor is my name . 
  thx !, 
   duck did your read the joke about the us secret service ? 
  they changed the `` keep down '' to donald duck '', 
  noone should forgive/stop prosecuting crimes against humanity - ever . 
  even if this does not lead to a conviction that is actually enforced . 
  my ( real ) name is actually timo , which derives ( as you know ) from timotheus , again greek . 
  as it translates into `` fear god '' , and theus = god , my name is actually literally `` fear '', 
  just call me the german bloodsucker ;-) i realize it kind of disturbs the greek on this sub immensly ( you are probably number 10 ) , which was n't my goal . 
  i was in need of a new username and stumbled upon the behaviour of insects described as hematophagy ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hematophagy ) - and just went along with it . 
  that may very well be true , but if you check opinion polls , why they stand behind erdogan it 's basically 3 things : * made the economy grow * promised to make turkey `` great again '' * is a religious man number 1 would be dead - and everyone will feel it . 
  it should n't be in my understanding - although you are obviously right that this is handled with `` much more senitivity '', 
  best thing is : after being denied a public speech in germany the turkish foreign minister went to the itb ( largest tourism fair ) to promote `` holiday in turkey '' in berlin ... http://www.bz-berlin.de/media/turkish-foreign-minister-cavusoglu-at-the-international-tourism-trade-fair-itb-in-berlin, 
   i do n't see how iraq and afganistan migrants can come to the eu without going through turkey correct - look at the numbers again - 2.7 vs. 3.1 makes roughly 400k people from other countries in turkey - including afghans , pakistanis , iraqis ... and some bangladeshi, 
  wait for it ... the tourism in turkey declined 30 % in 2016 ... it will rapidly decline in 2017 and the `` boom '' will crash ... 
  it 's nothing . 
  if you continue '' ... go and burn them/send them to the gas chambers '' - you are inciting violence and are on the hook . 
  uuuuh alternative tweet then ? 
   in 2015 50 % of the migrants coming thru the medditeranian sea were syrian that may very well be true - but if you guide your view to the headline of this thread ( turkey deal ) you will agree that this deal in no way covers any refugee arriving from lybia , egypt , tunisia at lampedusa , or elsewhere . 
  it would also be rather ridiculous to bring those africans fleeing eritrea to a camp in syria . 
  and yes - that 's another problem to adress - but again : not while discussing the turkey deal . 
  banlieue 13 - to learn parkour , right ? 
   i do n't know . 
  see - as long as noone has a somewhat decent , feasible answer to that , which does not completely ignore basic human rights - i still keep asking the `` hipshooter populist answers '' . 
  on a side note : israel is breaching any second law daily ... and i ca n't see their behaviour as somewhat `` solution-orientated '' , the rest of the countries just do not have the problem . 
   but i believe there is a large majority which are n't syrian and are coming from iraq , afganistan and africa turkey has slightly above 3mio . 
  refugees , 2.7 mn are syrians http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/turkey_syrian_crisis_en.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war, 
  first : we started this discussion on the premise of `` camp in syria '' second : yes i think ( know ) most of the refugees in turkey are in fact syrians third : the description `` dissident '' is in that case given by assads troops - so everyone fleeing, 
  the assad troops and military police protect a camp full of dissidents on syrian soil ... you see the actual `` leverage '' the eu official ? 
  hint : they got none and regular purgings happen - people `` vanish '' . 
  let alone the fact that if not in the camp they vanish on arriving at the front door ... 
   border illegally aside from the actual legal ramifications - what would you do with those ? 
  as them coming in the 10thousands on boats is still the reality , besides the `` extreme vetting '' . 
  where ? 
  4000km away ... the logistics are not the ideal way to make this happen . 
   simply start doing rigorous screening process that would mean they are already on the eu soil , or wan na passport check them mid-sea ? 
  still leaves open the actual handling afterwards . 
  does n't seem they got ships, 
  by assad ? 
  ... uh , no, 
  i would argue that the majority of refugees in turkey are in fact syrians, 
   they are n't fleeing war in turkey . 
  this could change to some degree though . 
  a safe zone to help europe on the soil of its colony protected by nato ? 
  wan na rethink asking that question ? 
  we are talking about the turkey deal - which would have failed alrerady if they arrive at croatian border . 
  mid-sea would be beautiful place to build it !, 
  the moroccan 's move is not depending on the turkey deal - he comes from lybia or arrives at ceuta, 
  sure - but as the turkey deal shows - you are prone to blackmail, 
   outlandish idea it 's not - it 's already under discussion , but the question of feasability remains . 
  you somehow need to `` convince '' the host country . 
  that would be one - although not against the will of russia - and that 's the end of that . 
   border control i need to ask for the actual meaning of that ... a border patrol encounters a dhingi between turkey and greece - full of obviously desperate reugees - then what ? 
  ouch ... 
  yeah that feeling on the exact same street , that the atmosphere suddenly changed ... in 20 metres . 
  that 's sf . 
  also the micro-climate change is insane . 
  3 blocks - other climate . 
   back to syria well , i ca n't see any case this would n't breach a lot of laws . 
  sending them literally back to a war zone is not an idea that would go down well - with anybody . 
  ( besides that would be an easy way to suddenly play an active part in the war , that really dioes not need anymore `` active parts '' ), 
   lebanon , n. syria , some parts of libya etc are all good candidates . 
  difficult do defend/build such a place probably - but up for discussion . 
   get shit done so - how should it be handled ? 
  let 's assume the `` wave '' come again - at unsustainable level storming the shores of greece . 
  * catch them at sea level and bring back to turkey ( wo n't be allowed to board ) ? 
  * bring them onshore and then send them back ( some will have a valid asylum reason ) ? 
  * bring them onshore and redistribute them across europe ( this one already failed ) ? 
  * close them down in one central facility ( australian/hungary way to do it ) ? 
  * stopping the boats and just do not let them enter ( this will have nasty sscenes coming up , also against sea law ) ? 
  * ... genuinley open to discussion - need more input though, 
  do n't we all ? 
  bad mood ? 
  undersexed ? 
  that 's why i posted the requirements for adapting the euro - not for joining the eu, 
  ft.alphaville is one of my favourite blogs , and they got really good journalists working there . 
  as it is not paywalled - it just needs registration for free - i will not , in order to support the guys . 
  i deliberatley posted it without formatting ... just to visually contradict the `` what rules '' answer of the guy above me . 
  sometimes it seems you can calculate muslim peoples retardedness on a `` haram '' scale : from dog haram - ( cultural differences ) over to slaughter haram ( close to animal cruelty ) to boko ( book/education ) haram - complete idiots . 
  german version goes `` a crow does n't hack out the other one 's eye '', 
  if the referendum is based on the same level of propaganda ... then yes . 
  if it is based on actual information ( and i think this time there is no other way to convince people ) than no . 
  as a europen : exactly my thought since cameron rumbled about referendum ... 
  and wait for the trident-base and oil industry-discussion flaming up again ... ... but i assume brexit did set a very good conditioning tiowards `` informed public opinion '' - they wo n't get through with just blowing sand in the eyes of the electorate,
