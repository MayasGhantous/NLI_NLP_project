  noone sees the need to punish anyone ( let 's keep aside the rhetorics of politicians on both sides ) . 
  it 's just like a divorce - things have to get `` unbundled '' . 
  that 's not something you do in a short time . 
  think of project financed over 6 years , everybody agreed upon ( no matter where ) . 
  you ca n't simply pull the plug of one share of funds . 
  it 's not working like that . 
  and whatever `` soft '' means for you - there is just no way that brexit is allowed to undermine the very fundamental rules of the eu - like the 4 freedoms , the high court or the single tariff union . 
  you are either in - or out . 
  not much of cherry-picking possible , because the whole system is more important than the single country relationship . 
   money to fix our helicopters is that really a question of funding ? 
  right now it seems you listen ( as he listens ) to fox & friends ... or murdoch as he is called . 
   we can do a lot of damage to the eu . 
  it 's even worse - you do not even realize the threats then ... 
  threats and anger ... glad you decided to shut off the little island, 
  so are we ... and to a much larger share . 
  and noone asks for the share in any uk projects . 
  now look - the germans do n't ask to owe the projects funded in the uk - and theresa should not ask the other way round . 
  for the sake of the receiving entities the planned project should be finsihed , as has been agreed upon . 
  comment section is cancer as usual : * helen spain 21 feb 2017 1:48 pm walk away theresa may . 
  why the hell should we pay in after we have left ? 
  germany and its collaborator france want to rob us of our money . 
  we paid enough to defeat germany and to free france from the german invaders.now they are still toadying to the germans . 
  of course there is one or two bright thoughts . 
  france could vote le penne in . 
  germany could kick out merkal . 
  greece will have left the eurozone . 
  so by 2020 the eu could be no more . 
  this budget also funds a lot uk-based projects ... 
  they are easy to mix up ;-), 
   introduce a new `` solidarity '' pension that ensured an ample living standard for anyone who had paid into the system for 35 years . 
  as pensions are slowly driven down to 42 % of former wage , you can assume that everybody earning less than 250 % of minimum wage will in fact fall to poverty after receiving pensions ... 
  the crispier ones can only run at lower speeds - like up to 3ghz , the non-crispy ones go up to 4,8 ghz . 
  now figure out if i was sarcastic or not ;-), 
  not really ... both marios are/have been goldmann sachs-affiliated . 
  even the earthquake detectors could pick that one up ... 
  it is ... 
  on a side note : https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/, 
   the three most powerful figures in the trump administration bannon , preibus and murdoch ? 
  to be fair i can think of exactly one reason : the cold weather ... 
  the discussion has a real-life example : neither scotland ( after breaking away from uk ) nor catalunia ( same with spain ) would be `` automatically '' in the eu . 
  the experts opinion differs though , but they tend to `` reapply for eu '', 
   v4 is that something official ? 
  i assume it 's an informal thing , or they have rules in written form ? 
  soooo - we ban the islam faith then ? 
  easy - he is confused and dumb : https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/833435244451753984 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oszjfamk-ri, 
   everyone has the same opinion yeah well ... just like asking `` what 's 1 +1 ? 
  the answer tends to be `` 2 '' . 
  we call that common sense and truth ... 
  maybe when you grow up and earn your own money ;-) that said please never grow up , i like you the way you are berlin . 
  only augsburg has a city holiday . 
  rest is statewide , with bavaria at the top . 
  correct . 
  thats why i picked augsburg . 
  rest of germany has 14 or less days . 
  nope . 
  but this year we are lucky . 
  only one is on weekend . 
  ah i see ... your logic came to an end ... 
  there has been a poll , where they asked : `` if ( !!! ), 
  you could directly vote the chancellor - who would you vote '' and both have been at 30 % ( or schulz at 31 % , merkel at 30 % - do n't remember exactly ) . 
  but in germany we vote parties - no chancellors . 
  this means he needs a coalition majority - and that 's a lot less likely . 
  ( especially not to head the largest party ), 
  honestly - if macron and schulz could form the backbone of a future europe and actually refom it - that would be a milestone . 
  although as of now macron looks much more probable than schulz does . 
  under the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ( ceta ) between canada and the eu , canada agrees `` to protect 143 geographical indications for high-quality european products , such as roquefort cheese , balsamic vinegar from modena or dutch gouda cheese and many others . '', 
  ( from wikipedia ) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:52016pc0443&amp;from=en, 
   every move what are you talking about . 
  that was n't a `` minor issue '' . 
  the greek people voted for a `` no '' towards the bailout ( clearly with the understanding that this would result in a grexit ) . 
  tsirpas ignored the vote and accepted the bailouts . 
  3months later he did get reelected . 
   dishonest you might refer to your brother in spirit : https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump?lang=de, 
   but neither the referendum in june 2015 nor the election of syriza prove or disprove that . 
  that 's like sayin `` i vote for swimming , i never voted to get wet in the process '', 
  they ( re - ) elected tsirpas on 20th september 2015 - 3 months after he agreed upon a bailout-programm clearly denying the former referendum ( which would have resulted in a grexit ) . 
   grexit i remember people voting against that ... in greece, 
  you forgot shipping - it 's a major export industry ... unfortunately the do not pay any taxes . 
  most is germany -  out of europe, 
  all greek debt is denominated in $ . 
  dropping out of the euro is immediate bankrupcy . 
  the idea that the debt can be reduced by `` deflating out of it '' is an alternative reality . 
  nothing . 
  it just gives trumpeters a reason why it 's part of the `` opponent ``, 
  i assume the moment jeff bezos saved it ... 
  increase pressure and you loose people believing in `` the system `` . 
  at least guys proposal needs a new eu contract . 
  broks does not . 
   undemocratic today an elected parliament approved of it . 
  btw there would be no need to get it approved by national parliaments ... becuase it 's a european agreement of trade . 
  such are negotiations - each partner walks in with maximum demands . 
  i 'm pretty sure that these bills will be settled in a way everyone ... looses, 
  constant dropping wears the stone . 
  well - the tone is changing . 
  look at the timeline from k\u00f6hler ( german economical interest need to be defended ) who had to go , to gauck at the munich conference ( 2014 `` taking responsibilty '' ) to v.d.leyen these days ( `` we need to do more '' ), 
  do not sing it ;-), 
  from a turkey point of view - yes , you are absolutely correct !, 
  uuuh - we did n't intend to radicalize stuff . 
  you know - been there , done that . 
  to be fair it seems the first dogma is a stronger dogma than the second ... at least if you ask the man on wheels .
