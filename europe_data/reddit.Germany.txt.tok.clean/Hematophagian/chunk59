  at least the bases where they store the nuclear bombs to fix to the eurofigthers, 
   there is also the question of paying the uk for its share of eu assets . 
  besides those other points - yes this is definitley part of the story , although i assume the balance sheet is lower then you think . 
  wan na have a 1/28th of the parliament building ? 
   almost all observers have been quick to note that there is almost zero public support in germany for nuclear weapons . 
  that would be the death sentence to any party proposing it . 
  but why not build up the french arsenal , have a common deterrent and paying for it ? 
  did n't see - but i give you the fact that they artifically blow up that number to maximum proportions ... just for the show . 
   they now want us to pay up just in case ireland needs bailing out all of a sudden . 
  ~ ~ i did not read that anywhere ... ~ ~, 
  if they are on that list you definitley agreed upon them , some might even be initiated by you . 
  correct - it 's just a gurantee, 
  * reste \u00e0 liquider ( ral ) roughly translated as `` yet to be paid '' , the reste \u00e0 liquider is essentially a $ 241 billion bill that has ballooned since 2000 as the eu has piled on projects to its schedule of works and investment . 
  while that $ 241 billion must be paid by all member-states of the eu , it represents the biggest portion of the brexit charge . 
  it effectively arises from political divisions over the eu budget , which mean the eu systematically commits to more spending projects than its member-states are willing to pay for in a given year . 
  this is managed through a forked accounting method . 
  inspired by a bygone french bookkeeping technique , the eu adopted a system of budgeting that splits its accounts into ` commitments ' ( basically appropriations to spend money for a specific purpose or project ) and payments ( to actually execute those commitments ) . 
  the eu 's long-term budget sets ceilings for both annual commitments and payments . 
  but crucially , the annual commitment ceiling is almost always bigger than payments . 
  that leaves a ( usually increasing ) overhang of unpaid commitments . 
  so in a typical budget year , the eu can be paying for the implementation of commitments first registered in the eu 's annual budget anywhere from one and 20 years previously . 
  most commitments from the 2014-20 budget are supposed to be paid for by 2023 . 
  chart 1 : the eu budget commitments and payments , 2014-20 source : european commission . 
  100\u00a0120\u00a0140\u00a0160 180\u00a02014\u00a02015\u00a02016 2017\u00a02018\u00a02019\u00a02020 commitments payments source : . 
  $ billion this runs against the grain of the british public finances , which operate on the basis of accruals . 
  if a high-speed rail line is approved in the uk , it will only appear in the annual budget once a payment is actually made .2 britain 's fixation with payments has driven its diplomacy in brussels . 
  along with other net-contributor states , it saw the giant ral as proof of financial mismanagement by the commission .3 in practice the treasury 's strategy for parsimony was to largely ignore the overhang , and instead focus on maintaining discipline over annual payments , much to the irritation of the commission and european parliament . 
  that largely worked for london . 
  but brexit may have dramatically changed the calculus . 
  the ral will stand at up to $ 241 billion by the end of 2018 , a few months before britain 's expected exit date from the eu . 
  more than half is made up of cohesion spending , and a fifth each by research and agricultural spending . 
  as a result of the latest long-term budget being delayed , the eu is off to a later start on big project spending than usual ; most of the cohesion spending is backloaded , to be executed in the years after the uk has left . 
  britain 's share of the ral , based on its typical contribution rate , would be around $ 29-36 billion . 
   random shit like an imaginary irish bailout . 
  if they need the money you are on the hook . 
  the rest : completely agree with you, 
  read up . 
  they might be legally binding - but paying for a eg science project that starts in 2021 and may cause 10mn in budget ... those might be up for discussion ( and fairly so ) . 
  and that 's the main difference : the 60bn include any `` planned '' project , even if it 's uncertain when and if it really would be started . 
  i assume as the budget gets smaller , the absolutes get smaller and the shares are divided anew , which basically means that the list of net-payers would be increased ( ireland is the one `` switching sides '' and malta maybe too ) and the net-receipients get less ( bulgaria is the one receiving most/per head ), 
  we still order together ... and will so till the uk has left . 
  that 's what has to be negotiated . 
  from my understanding the 60bn figure is worst case scenario ( every bail-out must be paid in , every commitment paid ), 
  * the make-up of the bill is little understood , even by eu-27 countries . 
  the $ 60 billion covers britain 's potential obligations in three main areas : legally binding budget commitments that will be paid after britain leaves ; pension promises to eu officials ; and contingent liabilities -- such as bailout loans to ireland -- that would only require payments in certain circumstances .

   i dont consider schauble a federalist though oh he is ... just not in his role as german cfo . 
  and he is pragmatic . 
  as long as he does not see responsibilty implemented ( fiscal union ) he goes for `` pay us back '' . 
   thats a scenario that we would not have imagined before . 
  well that is a very old concept . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multi-speed_europe ) it might suprise you that especially sch\u00e4uble was a strong envangelist of that concept in 1994, 
   but it looks like current events are winning his argument easy to say as a brit ;-), 
  the major question is : `` why does she meet him '' as `` mr kaczynski , holds no formal government position . '', 
  when the main power centre is outside of gouvernment ... somethings rotten, 
  maybe not irreversible - but the moment germany would leave the euro it would become dispensable . 
  is that scenario likely ? 
  is it possible ? 
  to a very small degree yes . 
  regions joining a federal union ... the next step after nations . 
  that 's europe comin together for you . 
  it 's literally `` overspill '' it 's not on purpose . 
  here is a discussion about it ( careful : lot of agendas ) : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1r7q6i/poland_builds_electronic_wall_to_keep_out_german/?st=iyuajznc&amp;sh=74bdc5a1, 
  noone rates student loans at aaa ( or a + ) though . 
  even when it is in an opaque bundle . 
  one should mention that our neighbours ( especially to the east ) shut their grid off to german exports - or at least do regualte them ... because the constant overspill of germans green energy brought their grids close to collapsing . 
  both missions were more or less betrayed by higher-ups in letting them go down alone . 
  but you are right the story of the dutch is on another level . 
  still each of the others probably thought of the same rules . 
  edit : on a side note there is a really haunting documentary about unamir : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424435/, 
  oh sure - asking just out of interest, 
  * sweet greek blood *, 
  as far as i can tell neither the irish ( after jadotville , congo ) , nor the canadians ( after unamir , rwanda ) introduces such rules , anyone knows different ? 
  as a stock-owner of airbus ( being 15 % in + since donald started to sqawk ) i agree, 
  the uk government has officially launched its plan to sell student loans through securitisation , beginning a series of deals that are expected to generate # 12bn for the exchequer . 
  the first deal , expected this year , involves loans with an outstanding face value of around # 4bn that first entered repayment between 2002 and 2006 , though the sale price could be lower due to quality of the loans . 
  around half of the securitisation is expected to be unrated . 
  the government expects a series of similar deals between now and 2021 , generating a total of # 12bn and effectively creating a new asset class in uk bond markets . 
  securitisation is a process where loans , such as mortgages or credit card debt , are packaged up and sold on as bonds to investors . 
  the mechanism is commonly used to sell off student debt in the us . 
  the government 's plans to begin selling part of a # 44.5 bn student loan book were highlighted in last year 's autumn statement , though it was unclear what form the sale would take . 
  student debt has increased in the uk since the government raised tuition fees to # 9,000 a year in 2012 , up from # 3,000 previously , though the loans that will be sold through securitisation originated earlier than 2012 . 
  the loans that will be securitised are `` income contingent repayment '' ( icr ) loans , meaning repayments depend on the earnings of the borrower . 
  all student loans held by the government are currently in icr form . 
  repayments on the loans will continue to be administered by hmrc and the student loans company . 
  `` this sale makes sense for taxpayers and will play an important contribution in our work to repair the public finances , '' said david gauke , chief secretary to the treasury . 
  the sale follows on from the `` sale of student loans act '' in 2008 , which originally authorised the sale of student debt to raise government revenues . 
  as someone at that tax bracket i would all be for a flat tax ... but in the face of rising inequality in germany and the rise of a populist movement nourishing from those that ( if only ) feel to be left behind i do favour a more social ( ist ) / solidary approach . 
   club ** med ** members ftfy, 
  sensitive rule, 
  did n't know about the not-requirement to call parliament - no reason to be salty ;-) as of now the crops is prt of natos rapid response force - and therefore mostly integrated in one `` stream of decision '' . 
  i did read that the parts can be deployed independently somewhere : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i._german/dutch_corps, 
   the dax and the economic strength of the eurozone are not related . 
  well ... they 're definitley related ... to what extend is debatable though . 
  for the record : the term `` alternative facts '' is practically dead since 20minutes . 
  the new term to officially replace this is called `` i call my own shots - based on an accumulation of data '' ... https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/828575949268606977, 
  noone said it 's perfect ... besides in this case i doubt a bilateral dutch-german decision would take significantly longer than a german one ... 
   donald wo n't be happy . 
  why not - the dutch build up their amphibious force , while the germans provide the tanks . 
  perfect example of how it could work .
