  it cant expand with according regulations . 
  the housing market was/is extremly deregulated in spain, 
  `` breaches of the deficit/debt rule '' : 2008-current : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact, 
  overheating the housing sector and creating a bubble was n't all that good either i seem to remember . 
  ... stereotypes - not unheard of in / r/europe, 
   is this fair towards czechs ? 
  no - the eu-scum and germany is to blame for that ... no !, 
  wait - it 's the refugees !, 
  is it infectious ? 
  he should have sold anti-gay medicine with it - that 's how you make business !, 
  soooo answering the real questions - here is a video of turtles having sex : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7re_fg2xaua, 
   you confused warsaw uprisings . 
  this is in fact true ... need to polish my history lessons now and then ( sry for pun - intended ), 
  that 's why i explicitly put in the quote . 
  i think it is different with poland . 
  it was n't `` conquer some land for future nazi generations '' . 
  it was `` take back and make it german - all of it . 
  germany ( the overwhelming part of the ppl . ), 
  wants it '' . 
  for one - the role of the murderer and of the victim is pretty obvious . 
  one could have choosen to use `` nazi murderer '' instead of german , but ludwig fischer was n't `` a nazi murderer '' but a `` german gouvernour '' - or as it was planned : * no government protectorate is anticipated for poland , but a complete german administration . 
  wan na make a bet ? 
  you will even lend the name to it - let 's call it the `` cork agreement '', 
   i 'm pretty sure the uk will try to find another rule-lawyering way to weasle out of taking migrants they wo n't even be eu till this comes in effect . 
  refugee just entering a boat in lybia : `` but gallifreyan_pleb said we would be welcome ! '', 
  call it the `` merkel-effect '', 
  well he was vice-president at gs . 
  prodi had very close relations to gs too . 
  if you google you can find a ton of partially not so far out conspiracies . 
  one of it : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/what-price-the-new-democracy-goldman-sachs-conquers-europe-6264091.html, 
  draghi 's nationality could be described best as `` goldman-sachs '' to be honest . 
  being german ... that was of course / s - you might want to read the guy i answered that obviously supports this idea , but was to much a coward stating it . 
  while just minutes ago above i got full shit/downvote for claiming a european responsibility ... 
  http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php nope for april , trend going down, 
  ok - next stop : `` shoot them all '', 
  sure - you can shit next to the toilet and tell the cleaning lady is her job to clean . 
  from the devastation on local mena farmers our highly subsidiesed exports cause ( http://www.dw.com/en/eu-poultry-exports-damages-african-markets/av-17380174 ) , to the support of regional industries that damage the whole ecosystem ( http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/06/kenyas-flower-farms-no-bed-of-roses/ http://www.somo.nl/news-en/uranium-mines-threaten-african-people-and-nature ) , or the collapse of whole societies ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/darwin%27s_nightmare ) to the existence of standing armies by eu corporations ( http://www.projectcensored.org/16-mercenary-armies-in-service-to-global-corporations/ ) and not even going to the history of colonialism i think it is a fair point to say `` the eu has some responsibility '', 
   the amount of refugees coming by boat to italy were never that large either . 
  which is wrong : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/migrants-crossing-the-mediterranean-death-rate-rises-50-fold-since-end-of-italys-mare-nostrum-search-10179310.html, 
   we are not responsible for the wealth and health of the mena populations . 
  while i do n't see us to be directly responsible - this sentence is wrong on so many levels . 
  okok ... too much time on / r/shitamericanssay i officially apologize and correct myself, 
  please do n't . 
  we do n't want to pay for another reunification ... poland can have it and all . 
  there are so many stories unique to berlin - in no possible history it could have stayed that way . 
  funny things from my experience : * early to mid90s `` weekday-bars '' just called monday-bar etc. 
  no licence , no nothing , just two barrels and a plank in some place abandoned in eastern berlin , only open one day/week . 
  most fun of them in cellars of non-existing houses with a hole and a ladder as entry . 
  * occupied building , when someone discovered a telephone line coming out of a wall . 
  not working till someone got the idea to predial a `` 0 '' . 
  from then : 20 people queing and using the fromer gdr-ministry line for calls around the world . 
  sadly because wild rabbit would taste much better then pet rabbit ;-), 
  got it !, 
  thx, 
  the german handball-association has 800.000 member and 4.500 clubs . 
  it 's not that the sport is n't internationally played - but i think as it is no. 2 behind ~ ~ soccer ~ ~ football , it is overly popular in germany . 
  what 's the difference between p\u00e9tanque and boules though ? 
  you 'll need it outside of europe . 
  kaliningrad ... : * jin ling is a russian brand of cigarettes produced by kaliningrad-based manufacturer baltic tobacco company ( russian : \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 , btc ) . 
  the name is derived from jinling , the older name of nanjing , where the brand was originally developed by the chinese state-owned nanjing tobacco factory . 
  [ 1 ] after the brand died out , baltic tobacco company re-introduced it in 1997 . 
  [ 1 ] the packet design resembles the american brand camel in colour , typeface and layout , [ 2 ] but instead of a camel , it features a mountain goat . 
  ** jin ling cigarettes are only sold illegally and the brand is the first to be designed explicitly for smuggling . 
  ** it has been reported by customs officials as the `` most seized '' brand in europe ; [ 1 ] in 2007 , 258 million jin ling cigarettes were seized by authorities in eu countries . 
  [ 4 ] in 2011 it was reported in the uk 's daily mail newspaper that tests on jin ling cigarettes had found them to contain industrial chemicals and asbestos . 
  mostly wrong - the too have an inflation target , which would be totally undermined by a strong currency as a dm would be . 
  so yes - they would do whatever they could to reach that `` stability '' as it is defined by roughly 1 % inflation . 
  with a dm you would have 2 % deflation . 
  the deutsche mark would n't be able to `` outprint '' the massive influx of foreign money , just as the swiss could n't keep up with it . 
   richer members giving money to the weaker members to grow that is happening . 
  maybe not enough - or not directly enough , but it is already an inherent eu concept . 
  what you miss is trust - noone trusts greece anymore in any way , that a money infusion would work . 
  and as a loan is practically for free nowadays , more `` stimulation '' would not help you either as of now . 
  reduction of debts however is inevitable . 
  the northerners have some quite reputable divisions too : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taktisches_luftwaffengeschwader_51, 
  they sure try it in the us : http://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/liability-for-abusive-or-insulting-language.html, 
  i 'm a little bit ashamed - but i have to admit it ( and besides all the other reasons ) : anyone else would like to see the brexit happen just for the sake of see what happens next ? 
  it 's such a cliffhanger, 
  i would bet mrs. merkel has the very same intention . 
  besides it is not a question of national influence , but of european negotiation . 
  conquer moscow - nowadays we have friendly territory till east of kiev . 
  that 's a mere 800km to moscow !, 
  totally different then all the times someone tried before . 
   we have already developed a british identity a very fragile one according to the last scottish referendum ;-) you barely kept the trident base there . 
  it also bares any facts . 
  ca n't see the logic between those two . 
  especially not if they will specialize , just as the very same article mentions about the amphibious capacity provided by the ducth . 
  so the conversation goes : germany : `` we would like to deploy troops on that beach '' dutch : `` nope '' ... 
  most likely up to 3 court decisions - cause this will definitley go up to the constitutional court . 
  there is an interesting way out , if all else fails : the lawsuit against him , could be dragged out till 2018 . 
  law abolished : lawsuit done . 
  there is also an interesting `` way out '' she offered by that . 
  if they would drag the lawsuit to a time the law is abandoned - the lawsuit is also gone . 
  on a side note : she did explain her decision by `` not the gouvernments job to decide - therefore i transfer this to the courts '', 
  the us wants it 's eu weak - not dissolved . 
  and the answer to this is : no prosecution is allowed - though it does not make any difference after all , because almost 100 additional lawsuits have been filed for `` normal '' insult already . 
  answer exactly now ( or in the next minutes ) : http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/livestreams/livestream-zwei100.html, 
   i 'd assume most germans knew that i doubt that . 
  most of them probably thought `` shit . 
  we would pay even more , if they would leave '' .
