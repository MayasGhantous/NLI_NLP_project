  besides - now you need the approval of two parliaments to go to war ... not the worst idea . 
   this is the case with military procurement in the us as well . 
  as can bee seen eg at the abrams-production ( http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/02/11/ohio-wins-again-in-armys-budget-for-more-m1-abrams-tanks.html ) airbus and the recent kmw-nexter ( french-german tank production ) do proove that it can work out though . 
  there is room enough for 2 opinions on 1 subject in europe ;-), 
  even with this it still stands that flat tax impacts taxpayers disproportionately even though the tax is proportionate . 
  there are several studies that prove a progressive tax counters inequality better than flat taxes . 
  it also serves as a better stimulant for the economy . 
  low incomes have a significantly higher spending % - out of sheer necessity . 
  but it also is obviously a philosophical debate - there are arguments for both sides . 
  vice versa . 
  why should you pay an absurd % of your income when you earn so little you just barely make it ? 
  besides the fact that apples phones come out of china/taiwan - noone wants a trade war . 
  and the mafia ( microsoft-alphabet-facebook-ibm-apple ) will do whatever they can to resist anything protectionist . 
  they transcended being american - they are truly global . 
  take the percentage and apply it to the rent ... 
  4-8 % return . 
  heavily depending on city ( obviously ) . 
  frankfurt at avg . 
   everyone is taxed on that % i just realize that romania seems to have a flat tax ( ... how absurd ) . 
  almost every other country has a : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressive_tax, 
  what 's crazy about that ? 
  if you ca n't `` get by '' on 5.3 k net ... you 're doing it wrong . 
  besides - at that level this is not your single revenue stream . 
  most likely you have stocks or are a landlord by the time you earn 10k . 
  3.500 are taxes , 1200 are social insurances . 
  leaves you with 5.300 net . 
  looking on history it might be one of the most clever ones ... noone knows, 
  i used to think that was mirror writing ... 
   boycott 7 % good one !, 
  they miss a recent `` panic event `` berlin already dropped out of attention . 
   that 's why they 're in foreign faults after all . 
  not really . 
  the reason why germany stored gold overseas was the cold war fear of a russian invasion . 
  the gold reserve was the foundation of an exile gouvernment . 
   if we ca n't opt out of regulations then fine . 
  i 'm sure the eu wo n't miss the contributions the u.k. see ... that 's why you go on everyone 's nerves ... `` if i cant be the special snowflake i become so sad !, 
  and with all the money we pay '' . 
  ppl like you could really get lost . 
   minuscule try shipping 50t of gold over the ocean ... can rent a private army with that ... 
  there are several quite positive examples of china buying german companies : http://wolfstreet.com/2013/03/22/a-ceo-explains-why-he-sold-a-german-soul-to-the-chinese/, 
  i remember a piece about vw , chattanooga and how long it took them to train the people to be somwhat on par with their german counterparts ... the vocational trainings here are absolut superb . 
  fn takes it 's toll ... 
  that was not the question asked ... and again : as long as the european court of justice is the highest ranking court to dispute regulations organized in said agencies - fine . 
  if someone pops up and suddenly says `` but the uk supreme court needs to decide this regulations '' there is no sense in joining/remaining the agencies . 
  ca n't have cake and eat it ;-), 
  it was severly overblown . 
  in the meantime the process of transfering the actual gold is in progress . 
  last year 210 tons of gold has been `` repatriated '' to frankfurt , germany alone . 
  although in german have a look on this news and especially on the chart , which shows the transfer has been mainly from the us ( 84,5 t in 2014 , 99,5 t in 2015 ) https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article151529909/bundesbank-meldet-ersten-erfolg-ihrer-gold-mission.html, 
  well ... they did say they will leave the european judiciary . 
  there is that . 
  keeping them in some agencies would benefit all . 
  they just need to arrange the acceptance of according laws and integrating it to uk law . 
  what is not possible is joining the agency but having the right to ignore the underlying law ( because not accepting the european law ) or rejecting a law based on their own uk judiciary . 
  ... because what nooe should accept is special treatment from now on . 
   push things over the edge for poland there is only the abyss on the other side of that edge ... they won ` t go there . 
  crimea war . 
  setting hq in bukarest in 1853 seems pretty war-style to me ... just one . 
  17mio have been trained to do so from 45-89 . 
  this might have changed ... but not eradictaed . 
  your currency would sooner or later loose reserve status ... and with this much debt ... well . 
  besides 300m is the smallest `` block ``, 
   we start to worry more about our own affairs and much , much less about the affairs outside of our borders this will lead to the final decline of the us ... as then you would be thrown back only to your military might ... which is not easy to wield to gain power and respect . 
  even if you put 90 on a plane , you need 40 sitting next to them - and buy out the whole plane ... have a look on this infographic showing real deportation flights : http://www.zeit.de/feature/fluechtlinge-in-deutschland-abschiebung-fluege-gesetze, 
  pragmatism . 
  putting them on a plane with an officer does cost more . 
  is there anybody who truly believes that polish had camps ? 
  we were talking about guards ... not helpers . 
  those have been forced to hundreds . 
  not doubted . 
  saw the / s ? 
  do n't bite the hand feeding you ... / s, 
  putin must have a constant smile on his lips, 
  noone ( or everyone ) is born evil ... but anyone can become evil . 
  i recommend the banality of evil concept by h. arendt ( thank god also german ) : http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7278.htm, 
  just flat out : no !, 
  these have been to 90-95 % ss-totenkopf-soldiers . 
  those have n't been your little drafted poor guy . 
  most of them have been loyal fanatics . 
  many lived there with their whole families - good incentives for working in auschwitz . 
  fur further reading : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ss_command_of_auschwitz_concentration_camp so there is actually almost no case to defend them , or excuse it . 
  it is to 99,9 % complicity in mass-murder . 
  period . 
  vw stock : 12month low : 92,70 ; 12month hi : 165,55 . 
  i bought at 124 ... it 's now 146 . 
  thx obama, 
  basically either germany or alternative_germany ... 
  on the day of the rise of alt_g\u00f6bbels steven bannon ... 
  on a side not ... the next step would probably look like this ... making alternative-g\u00f6bbels big : trump gives national security council seat to ex-breitbart chief steve bannon https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/lobbying-ban-trump-executive-order-isis-strategy?cmp=share_androidapp_in_zwischenablage_kopieren, 
  ah i see my friend ... you are part of this famous `` alternative facts `` movement !, 
  nevermind ... 
  well ... now they could n't even go to the us for negotiations ... shits and giggles enough . 
  really ? 
  after the us installed the shah ? 
  a quasi dictator ? 
  ... yes in those days the relationship has been `` good `` . 
  boy ... you are thick . 
   poles like extreminate people on concentration camps that one i heard too ... just recently . 
  they named those `` polish concentration camps '' . 
  as a german i have to say : total copycat thing ... loosers .
