  totally overrated ... sad, 
  no healthcare - no worry ... i see, 
  ... is this another `` they are german not polush camps `` thing ? 
  honestly : who in here or anywhere else ever thought the polish had death camps killing jews ? 
  on a side note : today was a special event in parliament ... as every year : https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/ns-opfer-gedenkstunde-101.html, 
  if someone would ask `` how would it begin '' , i would answer `` like this '' : https://cpj.org/2017/01/journalists-charged-with-rioting-in-washington.php, 
   liberals when he keeps on like that the `` liberals '' are suddenly 80 % of the citizens ... 
  watch that interview with abc news ... it 's frightening : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6urd6lkfck&amp;t=11s, 
  he needs to be isolated and then we wait till they either go for impeachment or civil war over there ... 
  when we stop believing to `` fix '' a 16 year old we also can basically give up on all human beings older than that . 
  ah marvelous . 
  alternative germany in the news . 
  they 've been offered that step multiple times ... as they would go bust immediately - it 's a question of what they want . 
   brussels evening rush hour you wo n't be allowed to drive manually there anymore ... no more rush hour ... 
   globally that 's not relevant for the countries in question ... which have been us/uk, 
  in 15 yrs ? 
  maybe 10 % . 
  they wo n't even be allowed to drive anymore manually . 
  as if he would remember ... 
  first thing to go is millions of truck drivers, 
  armor protection was improved . 
  the leopard 2a6 is protected by composite armor of new generation and has external modular armor . 
  furthermore add-on armor , including explosive reactive armor blocks can be fitted . 
  interior of the tank is lined to prevent spalling . 
  this whole thing is 1mm short of holocaust denial ... and therefore should very well be named as it is : nazi-style fascist history-rewriting bullshit . 
  ... and will he build a wall too ? 
  + being close to the uk post-brexit, 
  hmmm , i do n't think he is using a polish language account ... but you are absolutely right . 
  edit : on a second thought ... \u00d6zils account is english ... 
  we probably need a source for this map anyway ... op ? 
  ( u/trax1 ) source ? 
  nope ... that would contradict polands choice ... as poldi is german . 
  both does cost us all though . 
   you disclaimer : i actually did profit from that , because i bought vw stocks at close to the lowest price in the last 2 years ... which means 20 % profit today . 
  it was described as precise and unforgiving ( to the orchestra ) . 
  some problem comes up with the fact that the orchestra is in the middle ... so half of them watches the eg singer from the back . 
  says the dutch sandwich ;-), 
  my guess would be austria ... 
   bedrocan http://bedrocan.com/products-services/healthcare/medicinal-cannabis/, 
  still a lot of left : http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=691, 
  part of the zeitgeist i guess ... 
  well , to be honest there are n't many places on earth that lived through that many changes in the last 100years than berlin ... 
  7 manchester, 
  9 katharinenburg ? 
  they want ... kind of back , you know, 
  sad, 
  i think he also is stupid ... he calls for lower interest and at the same time he says inflation must stop : one kilo of tomatoes rises to 7-8 liras in the market ... this is too high , '' he said, 
  what happened to you today ? 
  no sex ? 
  a copy, 
  but theresa said `` the people coming together now '' ;-), 
  / r/the _ macron the hype train ... quite active too !, 
  what 's his chances ? 
  does the hype-train already reach `` yes we can '' - levels ? 
   people those do not influence the pound sterling though ... 
  the problem is the amount of people that have been convinced by that ... 
  pleasepleasepleaseprettyplease vote macron, 
   the solution is to inform them then do i really have to remind you of that red bus with that 350mn pound to the nhs-claim ? 
  depends on your skill set . 
  vw just officially changed it 's company language to english : http://www.autoblog.com/2016/12/14/volkswagen-group-official-language-english/, 
  fun fact : youtube autoplay goes directly to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhometco0mi ) afterwards, 
  uk is when you invent liberal economics and follow it by the book ... homo homini lupus good luck with your tories having no counterbalance anymore, 
  see that 's the problem with your kind of uneducated people still able to vote ... you do not understand what you decide upon . 
  passporting is about having a common set of regulations ... which obviously wo n't happen on anything anymore outside the single market ( maybe one-sided acceptance by the uk ) ... it has nothing to do with tariffs, 
  let 's say `` it was discussed and some worried about '' : https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/nissan-sunderland-trade-tariffs-job-losses-brexit-julie-elliott-theresa-may, 
  french people ... just last week someone said : * french economy model is when a marxist reads liberal economists ; german economy model is when a liberal reads marx . 
  where ? 
  which ? 
  some service are included in the south korea deal ... some in ceta . 
  but other then tha ? 
  no insurance from outside the eu is available in the eu as far as i know . 
  unsure what this has to do with a future uk-deal ... 
   equivalence which is another word for `` let 's just accept each others regulations '' ... which wo n't happen . 
   have ever increasing power , where ? 
  it seems the economy get #s more and more power . 
  the elite owns those famous `` markets '', 
  not me ... the forex works on probabilities . 
  the alternative passport the city proposed is kind of a opaque thing ... 
  the regulations are porbably the most discussed - but if the ceta-standards are good enough , neither side would make much of a fuss about it ... they might even magae that in a 2 years timeframe . 
  comment from matthew elliot ( vote leave head ) : matthew elliott \u2714 @matthew_elliott superb speech from pm - everything we campaigned for @vote_leave . 
  inspiring vision for #globalbritain . 
  loved `` take back control '' reference, 
  well this `` free trade '' is kind of a grey area ... : * no tariffs ? 
  sure - no problem * full service passporting ? 
  nah ... not really * having a say in eu regulations ? 
  likewise ... hope we can stay friends ... 
  see - that 's why we get worse and worse politicians ... because it 's suddenly a stain to be one ... 
   serbia that 's your comparison ? 
  really ? 
  well ... you made the bed ... now lay down in it . 
  it 's up the moment she said `` parliament will vote '' ... because it reduces the chance of a hard brexit ... no matter what she said . 
   still hope to negotiate some of the custom union privileges if `` no tariffs '' is enough - it 's quite possible ... kind of `` half-turkey '' . 
  and tariffs are so 80s ( or trump-style if you prefer ) anyway ... noone wants them . 
  do n't forget , the german queen reigns in london . 
  but good joke - have an upvote, 
  honest question ... what exactly is `` elitist '' in merkel ? 
  `` you should be sent to gas chamber `` ... polish camp confirmed :p, 
  germany needs them . 
  not the uneducated ones though, 
  most arent even allowed to work now .
