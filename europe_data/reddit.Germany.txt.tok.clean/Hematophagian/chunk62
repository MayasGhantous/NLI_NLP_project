  and honestly . . if you compete on that level ? 
  get off reddit and learn something . 
  with one major aspect of non-eu migration ... which is completely unrelated to the eu . 
  i would bet he gets shot within 1 yr , if that wo n't happen he gets impeached in 2 . 
   we do n't have to lie to get people to buy our shit . 
   wait ... which side are you arguing here ? 
  the same as you - since the beginning . 
  the idea that russian tanks are cheap is just not true . 
  not even in absolute numbers . 
  and your argument shows it 's even much worse when looking at it on a relative base . 
  most of those are n't even available officially on the eu market . 
  the ford muistang and the camaro have just been adapted recently ... besides the non-harmonized pre-ttip rules make that much less likely ... 
  no really . 
  not much difference total . 
  it says as for now the t14 is roughly 6mn a piece . . as is the a1 . 
  as far as i remember there were several severe `` friendly-fire '' incidents - comes from deployment in the `` hotter '' regions . 
   push around a series of individual european nations i do not think that special taxes on single countries of the eu are possible , without retalitation of the entire bloc . 
   he would need a second term . 
  first he needs to survive his 1st term ... 
   all three players , us , russia and china are interested in destroying the eu . 
  not chinha ( see below ) and actually nor the us - trumps view is not the us view as of now ... 
  they prefer a weak europe - not a destroyed one . 
  really not that much : http://rbth.com/defence/2015/09/25/cost_of_russias_armata_t-14_tank_to_fall_by_half_49585.html, 
  try to find a scandal at merkels home ... might take a while to fabricate, 
  mccain would be the opposite bet, 
  ;-) i also can agree that a constant trade surplus is not ideal and can very well be seen as `` macroeconomic imbalance '' . 
  although one has to mention that the inner-eu trade balance is lower and decreasing - while the outer-eu one is increasing - which in return is beneficary for all eu countries . 
   it is illegal for countries not true ... show me the \u00a7 . 
  to be fair : a budget deficit is named as against the rules . 
  ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/search.html?qid=1484226310396&amp;dts_dom=all&amp;dc_coded=368&amp;type=advanced&amp;lang=en&amp;subdom_init=all_all&amp;dts_subdom=all_all ) there is a mentioning of `` macroeconomic imbalances '' , but there are no set rules against a trade surplus ... now proof me wrong or delete the word `` illegal '', 
  none ... iran & israel maybe ;-), 
   illegal show me the \u00a7, 
   fabricate down syndrome ? 
  tough job ... 
  foy anyone who wants to try : http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/european-politics/french-election/next-president the odds are roughly 13/5 - 5/2, 
  you miss everything my friend, 
  the best explanation since years . 
  this comment was presented by someone that has zero understanding of macro economy ... 
  fun fact : their tanks landed in germany ;-), 
  i knew all of that and nevertheless the city would never break away . 
  the made themselves quite comfortable , did n't they ? 
  just so the bavarians, 
  * and that freedom of movement is no longer an option for britain . 
  * end of story right there, 
  as probable as a breaking away of the city of london ... 
  ouch ... the comment section, 
  europe does mind though, 
  shortcut and democracy can under no circumstances exist in the same sentence ... 
  wo n't survive 5 minutes, 
  it went viral on facebook in europe ... i guess, 
  the turkey deal ? 
  the strengthening of asylum laws ? 
  the border controls ? 
  why not spend it ? 
  at this point it actually proves the sustainability of the debts ... 
  guy born further away than 25miles =  baddie, 
  agreed, 
  loves ? 
  with a steep rise in xenophobic crimes ? 
  neid with a d, 
  the free market is a bitch and needs some control . 
  on a side note : `` lack of staff '' is declared when there are less than 4 applicants/opening ... 
  is he really blaming germans for not coming to terms with their history ? 
  although this is an unbelievable racist comment it has a witty humour to it . 
  i will not downvote this one, 
  hurrdurr white nations first !, 
  id like to add a german one , because it is set in a very near future : https://youtu.be/1comn3rz1b0, 
   functioning transfer union you mean with fiscal control , synchronized tax systems and eu tax ? 
  way to go !, 
   breaking one law which one was broken ? 
  there is no agreed upon sanction mechanism for a trade surplus , while there very much is one for deficit spending . 
  that ` s why i put exactly those numbers in bold . 
  the eurozone numbers show less surplus . 
  the major surplus comes from outside europe-business . 
  that 's a very `` half-true '' statement . 
  the trade balance vs. the eu is not very high - and keeps shrinking ... : germany posted a eur 19.3 billion trade surplus in october of 2016 , down from eur 22.2 billion reported a year earlier . 
  it was the smallest trade surplus since january , as exports fell more than import . 
  in october , sales declined 4.1 percent year-on-year to eur 101.5 billion while imports decreased by 2.2 percent to eur 82.2 billion . 
  ** germany exported goods to the value of eur 59.7 billion ( -4.5 percent year-on-year ) to the member states of the european union , while it imported goods to the value of eur 54.2 billion ( -1.9 percent ) from those countries . 
  ** goods to the value of eur 37.4 billion ( -4.1 percent ) were dispatched to the euro area countries while the value of the goods received from those countries was eur 36.4 billion ( -2.6 percent ) . 
  sales to eu countries not belonging to the euro area decreased by 5.4 percent to eur 22.3 billion while the value of the goods which arrived from those countries was eur 17.8 billion ( -0.5 percent ) . 
  exports to countries outside the european union amounted to eur 41.8 billion in september 2016 ( -3.4 percent ) , while imports from those countries totaled eur 28.0 billion ( -2.7 percent ) . 
  in september 2016 , trade surplus was marginally revised to eur 24.2 billion . 
  on a seasonally adjusted basis , exports rose 0.5 percent while imports went up 1.3 percent from the previous month . 
  loel ... 
  did he ? 
  when did that happen ? 
  nigel farage on twitter : `` terrible news from berlin but no surprise . 
  events like these will be the merkel legacy . '', 
  brendan cox ( husband of murdered jo cox ) : '' @nigel_farage blaming politicians for the actions of extremists ? 
  that 's a slippery slope nigel '' https://twitter.com/nigel_farage/status/811123023621267456?lang=de, 
  ( readers letter ) - thought it is an intersting point of view ... from those elites sir , your pages overflow with predictions of disaster brought on by the brexit/trump axis . 
  leaving aside the depressing and repetitive pointlessness of this mass guesswork , its underlying assumption -- that things were better when people like us were in charge -- is at best dubious , at worst delusional . 
  under plu rule , we have two failed wars and the middle east in flames , china expansionist , europe enfeebled , america ineffective and russia resurgent . 
  at home , we have banking crises , stagnant median incomes , uncontrolled borders , record indebtedness , profiteering by the `` professional '' classes , and general social polarisation . 
  this is the eden from which the rude and licentious electorates have expelled us ? 
  ( letter from a reader ) face it . 
  we ft readers had our decades in charge and we blew it for everyone but us . 
  time for us to do what we 've been telling the rest of them to do for years , and suck it up . 
  or go forth and earn the respect that regains power .
