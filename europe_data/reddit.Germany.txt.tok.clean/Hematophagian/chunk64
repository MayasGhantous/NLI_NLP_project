  1st suspect was arrested yesterday . 
  berlin is a city with close to 4mio inhabitants . 
  in lets say nyc this or similar tjhings happen 20xtimes a day ... 
  and 18 in iran ? 
  embassy probably, 
  ftfy germany is sun now, 
  % is of all possible voter ? 
  the lower the chances to be accepted , the higher the will to take the money, 
  on a side note : the group accepting this is mostly balkan refugees ... 
  centric = yes . 
  dominated = no . 
  80mio seem to be represented in a fair balance mostly . 
  tricky this one, 
  there is no difference between german and european politics ... ;-), 
  german humour, 
   brexit is brexit is brexit is brexi you sure ? 
  german here : is n't it the eu just enforcing rules ? 
  * sinister laughter *, 
  it 's not the blue collar - it 's the lower tier white-collar . 
  it 's the guy sitting at his desk seemingly threatened and not much upwards mobility . 
  sch\u00e4uble does not care anymore about re-election . 
  he 's beyond that - in both a good and a bad interpretation . 
  here comes the lira ... 
  thats nothing ... : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jin_ling?wprov=sfla1 jin ling cigarettes are only sold illegally and the brand is the first to be designed explicitly for smuggling . 
  that is in one sentence the most short-sighted and intellectual underwhelming answer to the problem that should actually lead to exclusion on any argument ... 
  its all germany ... more or less ... soon ... 
  that and pina bausch https://youtu.be/cxpfd7gi8r0, 
  porncatonmananal : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y31jrihtvqo, 
  maybe further help needed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3_djilldfo, 
   favorable results uuuuh - what good is a `` favourable result '' from a doctor actually for ? 
  ( `` no sir , it 's not a tumour after i received your envelope '' - `` perfect '' ), 
   if the german government acts on this absolutely impossible to get a majority on that in germany . 
  but nonetheless the proposal did stir up some dust and made people revisit their cold war opinions . 
   the way your political establishment treats countries that hold different political views is disgusting and deplorable . 
  like ... picturing their leaders as nazis ? 
  thank god i live in bavaria . 
  i would have probably voted for her ... but never for the csu, 
  to late . 
  will visit czechs today . 
  4 yrs . 
  i miscalculated . 
  no year 0, 
  yep . 
  good catch . 
  if only titles would be editable . 
   such a sad story , he was only a few years away from retiring and getting to pension . 
  cmon he was greek ... not much difference between work and pension anyway ... ( / s ), 
  it is assumed that today in 480bc king leonidas of sparta died in the battel of thermopylae . 
  long live the 300 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uribxk7idya, 
  as the discussion about an eu army ranges between : `` muh superstate nedded '' and `` could n't even agree on the size of a cucumber ... '' : http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_a_pragmatic_approach_to_building_a_european_army311571, 
  fake ? 
  3rd : jurisdiction of the ecj, 
  nothing i wrote is wrong ... 
  if you move to the edge of a political spectrum , you easily swing around and emerge on the other side of it ... it 's l\u00f6ike a globe ;-) best example in germany is [ horst mahler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horst_mahler ) founded the raf ( red army faction - left-extreme terror group ) and later became member of the npd ( right-wing extreme party ), 
  interestingly the fdp and the cdu have actually no overlap, 
  it 's not cersei-style, 
   start a business that there are loads of big swiss companies and banks . 
  if you want to find examples for that i would n't go with watchmakers . 
  because of glencore switzerland is no. 1 exporter of copper . 
  nestl\u00e8 should be mentioned as several pharma corps . 
  typo ... augusta vindelicum should be vindelicorum ( it 's augsburg , 30km west of munich ), 
  that 's where my edit came from . 
  the ireland scheme does not work without a deutch company . 
  that 's why it 's called double irish with a dutch sandwich : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement#dutch_sandwich, 
  should get the dutch on-board ... 
  nah ... because he had n't many teeths left and used a woodmade denture, 
  http://tass.ru/obschestvo/4462448 more photos, 
  https://twitter.com/emmanuelmacron/status/855033309495046144?lang=de good enough !, 
  we are talking cars ... or hides ... not drugs :p, 
  well we need some fit guy ... which probably leaves us at either macron or rutte ... 
  yes - i know this seems like totally irrelevant ... but is part of again a large pr-campaign ... culminating in the words of a russian paper : `` how could you not vote for a torso like that ? 
  '' : https://twitter.com/bbcstever/status/894448013451694080, 
   i wonder if he had contact to moscow before . 
  naah . 
  enough to talk to the industry lobby about sanctions . 
  greens became the cdu minus the c, 
  in a german news outlet owned by it 's employees ? 
  tin hat ? 
  they say after brexit there 'll be food rotting in the fields . 
  it 's already started https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/05/brexit-uk-food-industry-eu-fruit-veg-pickers?cmp=share_androidapp_in_zwischenablage_kopieren, 
  best comment : https://i.redd.it/niq69r958sdz.png, 
  it 's actually more on gdr level . 
  to be fair : smoking still kills more, 
  why should they ? 
  more likely it gets jammed at the bo, 
  nox emissions kill more right now, 
  wait ... who is this `` other countries country '' anyway ? 
  never heard of it, 
  that actually was funny ... somehow . 
  have an upvote, 
  on a gross level french wages are usually `` grosser '' than german ones ... so there is that :p, 
  for the sake of information : * potsdam conference 1945 : * war reparations to the soviet union from their zone of occupation in germany were agreed . 
  it was also agreed that 10 % of the industrial capacity of the western zones unnecessary for the german peace economy should be transferred to the soviet union within 2 years . 
  stalin proposed and it was accepted that poland was to be excluded from division of german compensation , to be later granted 15 % of compensation given to soviet union . 
  * * in august 1953 , poland 's former government decided not to take further compensation from germany as a way to help solve `` the german question in the spirit of democracy and peace . '' * the founding of the [ foundation_for_polish-german_reconciliation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundation_for_polish-german_reconciliation ) and in parallel an agreement to end any demands `` corecting the border '' or further demands . 
  those are the facts - and they are undisputed . 
  the amount of money paid towards the `` east '' might be disputed , but comes to roughly 120bn ( all stuff included ) , the amount of money spend towards former slave workers/other victims of german occupation can be retrieved here : http://www.fpnp.pl/ and amounts to roughly 2bn $ ( since late 90s ), 
  hey you guys officialy declared to `` take care of poland '' : * war reparations to the soviet union from their zone of occupation in germany were agreed . 
  it was also agreed that 10 % of the industrial capacity of the western zones unnecessary for the german peace economy should be transferred to the soviet union within 2 years . 
  stalin proposed and it was accepted that poland was to be excluded from division of german compensation , to be later granted 15 % of compensation given to soviet union .
