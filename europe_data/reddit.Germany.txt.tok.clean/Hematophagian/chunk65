  she 's called ivanka ... nah just kidding, 
   poland fell under the soviets and never received a penny from germany despite completely raping that country . 
  seems kind of uninformed , do n't you think ? 
  might wan na update your infos here ... 
   she is an exception , personally i do n't know of any person from the generation of my grandparents receiving any compensation for slave labor in the industry and agriculture during wwii . 
  1,2 bn $ towards around 900k people ... 
  send 15 speedbots with rpgs ... done, 
  inb4 wage depression as an answer, 
  hey - we decided 500years ago ( actually exactly 500yrs ago ) that catholics are n't enough and invented protestant belief on basis of moral believes , not just because some king could n't get divorced ... still proud of that ( even when what followed have been centuries of war ) . 
  says the anglican ... who needed several heads chopped to do his own thing, 
  deleting it , eh ? 
  create a federation ... 
  the score of your comment gives me hope, 
  do n't they regularly mention that the jews killed jesus ? 
  if you would have a european mindset , you would define `` out '' as outside europe ... 
   karol tandera i know that ... and that 's why the zdf apologized publicly : https://www.zdf.de/doku-wissen/richtigstellung-tendera-102.html ( on a side note : i do get the sensibility about `` polish death camps '' ... but noone in their right mind would thinbk the poles did ever operate kzs ), 
   encouraged by zdf . 
  you might reconsider that ... as your understanding of `` state media '' might be somehow botched . 
  on a side note : someone officially declared this week `` poland week '' ? 
  detroit ? 
  ah - yes ... i remember the nicolas cage movie . 
  good point, 
   just show them pictures of the previous guy who did n't negotiate and ended up stabbed in the ass gadaffi ? 
  oh he did very much consent ... or why do you think those boats almost never left shore in africa as long as he was the man ... 
   do not care about libyans hey - they got 2 gouvernments anyway ( and probably some dozen tribes too ) ... you can choose !, 
  pumped  1tn $ into eastern germany so far...nation-building enough for one century ;-), 
   ihr deutschen that would n't be necessary . 
  it 's meant to be rude like `` germans . 
  you are ... '' but it 's like gollum saying `` germanses . 
  you sullied my precious '', 
  you know what 's the most annyoing part ? 
  the wrong grammar . 
  it always says `` deutschen '' ... the n is wrong and sounds completely idiotic ... 
  no thx ... 
   help the coastguard bringing them to libya . 
  is n't that what they try to negotiate since months ( years ) ? 
  without consent of lybia this would not be possible . 
  he also gained german citizenship, 
  they are busy destroying yemen ... 
  brought back germany to the community of nations . 
  french and israel relationship normalised, 
  disappointed mostly . 
  41 ... `` feels like : 41 '', 
   700-800 billion eur maybe we could just buy back the whole thing then , right ? 
  he 's perceived as too close to war ( s ) and nationalism . 
  both not very popular over here . 
   italy ?? 
  for what ? 
  against whom ? 
  they actually did pay themselves : * according to the paris peace treaties , 1947 , italy agreed to pay reparations of about us$ 125 million to yugoslavia , us$ 105 million to greece , us$ 100 million to the soviet union , us$ 25 million to ethiopia , and us$ 5 million to albania . 
  russia also received the majority of reparations ... i do n't think much of it ended up in poland . 
  well ... undisputed facts we want to remember and help to guide our actions today . 
   poland 's former communist government , under pressure from the soviet union , agreed in the 1950s not to make any claims on germany . 
   macierewicz said tuesday that communist-era poland was a `` soviet puppet state '' whose decision is not legally valid today . 
  * also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_reparations#world_war_ii_germany, 
  there definitley are such restrictions . 
  at least on a vat-basis . 
  you need to charge local vat the moment you cross a certain turnover-threshold . 
  that 's set on national level . 
  i seem to remember that it 's 100k $ for germany , but 18k for eg . 
  italy . 
  does not necessarily mean you need to setup a subsidiary . 
   `` we are talking here about huge sums , and also about the fact that germany for many years refused to take responsibility for world war ii , '' kaczynski , the leader of the conservative ruling party , told radio maryja last week . 
  the good ol' `` gibs money nazi ! '', 
  which obviously only works for companies founded in estonia ... and as long as you do not have an apple/amazon/google - like setup with a double irish with dutch sandwich ... you wo n't be able to only hold an estonian company with an ( eg ) german business ( = revenue stream ) . 
  i assume there are different restrictions at what amount you actually also need a company in the country you mostly operate ... on national level . 
  i would guess 46 % are also `` more positive '' ... * you never know what you 've got till it 's gone * ... singalong, 
  those are n't gates ... those are balconies/galleries,

  the source is shown in the video . 
  it 's not some hipsterass saying stuff . 
  he references several studies . 
  and you know what ? 
  they do not even contradict the nyt text .

  if or if not is quite debatable ... but let 's not go there  and so as long as the european union continues to exist in its current form let me finish this sentence for you - so we can agree : '' it is not sustainable '' you can go with that ? 
   and no , it can not be reformed or it would have been reformed decades ago and that 's where i beg to differ ... but history will be the judge in a decade here . 
  fyi : i referenced this guy : http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/james-obrien/which-eu-law-are-you-looking-forward-to-losing/, 
   while the arguments for brexit were moral , constitutional and most importantly about the long term future of britain . 
  so what eu law are you looking forward most to be abolished ? 
  alexander van der bellen is n't really austrians `` leader '' - that would be christian kern . 
  or did we explicitly say `` head of state '' ? 
  then it would be queen e.ii instead of theresa may .
