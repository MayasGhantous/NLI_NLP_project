  that 's an assumption from your end . 
  that is correct  you could quite easily say they care more due to having living relatives at working age and understanding unemployment having lived through the depression in the 80s . 
  that on the other hand is not conclusive ... they know this might happen and risk it anyway ?

  ** on the leave side : ** * 61 % of leave voters view significant economic damage as a price worth paying for leaving the eu * 39 % of leave voters ( a plurality ) view themselves or members of their family losing their jobs to be a price worth paying for leaving the eu ** on the remain side : ** * 34 % of remain voters view significant economic damage as a price worth paying for remaining in the eu * 18 % of remain voters view themselves or family members losing their jobs to be a price worth paying for remaining in the eu * 19 % of remain voters view significant economic damage to be a price worth paying to to teach leave voters and politicians a lesson,

  because right now it is close to flooding and quite dangerous : last week 4 english guys capsized and almost drowned , the week before 2 guys did camp on a island mid-river and could n't get off the island for 2 days ( it 's like 20m to the shore ) . 
  yearly several people drown in the isar . 
   potato to be fair - potatos are immigrants too ... * following the spanish conquest of the inca empire , the spanish introduced the potato to europe in the second half of the 16th century , part of the colombian exchange .

  they rely on regulation bodies you no longer have ... 
  http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/james-obrien/i-dont-care-if-we-starve-at-least-well-be-free-eu/ i pity you, 
  well it matters if you keep saying `` ftas would be much faster negotiated '' . 
  so we go to 25 % less time for an fta with uk . 
  there are 40 ftas on that list - each of them did take between 3-5years to finalize . 
  you start at 0 - with an average speed of 2years/agreement you are at the same point in ... 80years - you might be able to negotiate 2-3 at a time ... brings you to approx . 
  30 years till you get to the level you have now . 
  even if ... this is the list of existing european ftas : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements the uk starts at zero, 
   germany directly invited them into their country source ? 
   the fact that millions came and stay illegaly is a failure , not a deliberate policy . 
  you could although argue this differently ( downvotes may hit me ) . 
  but by deliberately subverting the local african economies via several unfavourable agreements for them we kind of have an somehow active role here . 
  that really is the worst of paths you could have gone to further this discussion ... and i 'm afraid you have to go alone ... as i see some others gave you the decency to at least follow you . 
  well ... he was confirmed by the european parliament ( which could have rejected him ) , which you did vote for ... or at least had the chance to do so ... and as the fundamental principle of seperation of powers is enshrined in the eu-contracts ... those are european interests . 
  ... only that the `` no chlorinated chicken '' is a set decision all along ... keep going my friend ... at one thing which represents probably 0.01 % of all the discussions necessary . 
  face it - even coming to the same amount of ftas you now have will cost the uk decades ... 
  so this whole ordeal lasted 2 or 3 days just to recognize the obvious : negotiating a fta on a nation-level causes the same discussions as on a union-level and takes at least the same amount of time ... just that your leverage is a fraction of what you had before ...

   a democratic monarchy ? 
  that 's actually a good question i never thought about . 
  what does the schools teach you guys about your system ? 
  wikipedia calls it a :  the united kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy . 
  while you could n't show me the constitution in written form though . 
  because you are not a democracy and do not even have a written constitution ? 
  banana monarchy :p, 
  50 % voted by parliament , 50 % by federal council with at least 50 % votes ... definitley not by the secretary of justice ... which would break the speration of powers ... as it has been recognized by mr. duda,

  most of german water comes from deep wells , which do not need the same amount of disinfection : http://www.sueddeutsche.de/gesundheit/chlor-im-trinkwasser-mit-chemie-gegen-den-dreck-1.1121889 it also regulates the amount at 0,3 mg/l which seems very low .

   since we use it in water not really . 
  in germany it 's usually not allowed .

  http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/21/politics/russian-adoptions-magnitsky-act/index.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnitsky_act * on december 19 , 2012 , the state duma voted 400 to 4 to ban the international adoption of russian children into the united states . 
  the bill was unofficially named after dmitri yakovlev ( chase harrison ) , a russian toddler who died in 2008 of heat stroke after neglect from his adoptive american father .
