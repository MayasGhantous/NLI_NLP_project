  we do tend to not speak about our private parts around here ... edit : just for the pun ... but i just remembered this prime example of small dick guy from sweden : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqwuxl7a8sk, 
  unbelievable ... 1000s of years of history and it 's the model railway that gets the top spot ... ... but it 's a fun experience nonetheless, 
   swing states with tariffs kentucky bourbon is on the list, 
   nonsensical requirements . 
  go whistle !, 
  because they are fucking complicated to regulate ... and they are not included in any fta in recent history . 
  the most far-reaching is the southkorea/eu-one . 
  nothing comes close to eg passporting rights as in a single market though . 
  so they just can copy ceta ... done deal ... except that this one does not include services at any substantial level , and the uks main indutstry is...service-based . 
  as someone already said : you need to add something here . 
  a substantial part of the loan you gave your neighbour you had to finance via a loan yourself ... at a slightly higher interest rate ... 
  go whistle !, 
  uuuuh ... the dutch tanks follow german command ... the german ships dutch command ... https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/dutch-mechanized-brigade-to-be-integrated-into-german-panzer-division.398371/, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efhcdkb5uwc some men just want to watch the world burn, 
  fun story - a friend went to greece and booked via booking.com . 
  when arriving the guy from the hotel said : `` if you cancel your reservation right now ... i give you a better price '', 
  go whistle !, 
  was n't it planned to invite `` a '' president of the us anyway long time ago ? 
  trump : `` i wan na have a bigger tomb ... i will have the greatest of them all '', 
  first impulse : `` why do they attack him for being a vegan ? '', 
   the french leader also asked ahead of the meeting that germany provides europe with a 1bn euro fund for projects linked to it and nanotechnology . 
  still...click-baiting shit, 
  phase 3 probably . 
  phase 2 is born in germany , still not a german citizen . 
  switch germany to slovenia ... who was part of the bailout and obviously/propably also recieves interest on their share . 
   that percentage is 43 . 
  28,6 % foreign citizens 22,6 % german citizens with immigration history nyc : 37.6 % foreign born citizens, 
  [ do you have a flag ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utduy7qkvk8 ), 
  dw holds up to high standards - they would n't put up a `` wrong '' finding - and yes the content is absoluitely correct . 
  their `` wiggle room '' is in putting it up as full report instead of just mentioning it on a ticker by headline . 
  same for munich ... but this is a problem that diminishes with available funds ... 
  interestingly this comes of the german state news outlet ... so they might be arguing for their own funds here ... 
  many would probably settle for stockholm ( as you did not mention money as a factor ... ) . 
  might be too cold for you - so next best is munich based on your wishlist . 
   the largest foreign countries had hte largest share of greek bonds ? 
  which is n't true . 
  bnp paribnas was the most exposed ... outside of greece that is : https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jun/17/greece-debt-crisis-bank-exposed, 
   economic dynamics are not limited to accounting & arithmetic : woohooo the famous magic moment . 
  septembre 2008 : lehmannbrothers goes bankrupt ; 10 year bund yield at 4,6 % 1 . march 2009 : 10 year bund yield at 2,9 % october 2009 : the greek gouvernment revises it 's debt by +12,7 % 10 year bund yield at 3,2 % 1 . july 2016 : 10 year bund yield at -0,16 % today : 10 year bund yield at 0,4 % first : if greece would be your warning light you would be the worst investor possible ... at that time the whole fucking market burned like neros rome . 
  second : not enough to debunk the causation of this ... the charts do n't even show a correlation ... 
  the vanished bonds of a formerly bb rated nation called greece ( which would never ever have been exchanged by investors to aaa bonds ... completely different groiup of investors ) , which probably made up 0,0005 % of all possible bonds on the world market caused a surge in buying german bunds to such a large excess that the interest rate dropped down 2-3 full percent points ? 
  yeah ... try to tell that to someone who is n't a complete and utter idiot ... 
  so what you want to say and make me believe , is that the decline of greek debt ratings ( and supply ... because the market vanished obviously ) made investors turn to bunds ? 
  really ? 
  on a side note the us declined in rating to aa + too ... 
   without widespread hunger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_ohlwx2cx4 `` i do n't care if we starve , at least we 'll be free from the eu '', 
  statiung a direct rlation and cause-effect link between greek debt and the decline of interest rates on bunds is the far strechted idea i ever read . 
  the decline of triple a investments are to be faulted here ... or is the greek debt also the cause swiss bonds have a negative interest rate ? 
   rent is already high here loel ... compared to london/paris ... even dublin, 
  different role . 
  not carrying nuclear weapons either, 
  quite good in germany . 
  berlin is on 4th place i seem to remember ( neuschwanstein still 1 ), 
  no shit - probably in 90 % of all countries . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  dunno if milania would have been recognized as incorrect though . 
  did your ivana spellcheck ? 
  i had to google before i realized you meant the mother , not the daughter . 
   slovenian yeah thanks for explaining my joke to me ;-), 
  the ecb can per definition not write-of debt , nor is she the entity holding the greek debt ... 
   trade between the u.s. and the u.k amounted to a surplus 37 billion pounds ( $ 47.6 billion ) a year as of 2015 , according to britain 's statistics office . 
  by contrast , the u.s. bureau of economic analysis calculated a surplus of $ 11.9 billion in the same year , providing an awkward starting point , with both countries claiming to export more than they import from each other . 
  gnahahahahaha, 
  ... yeah well ... but it 's got no leverage on the majority of incomes . 
  so the `` why dont they increase wages '' - theme is a myth mostly . 
  worth noting that the gouvernmwent has zero influence on wages ( besides minimum wage - which was introduced ; and public servant wages - which have been increased ) . 
  so it 's spending on infrastructure and education . 
  / r/germany is quite rational ... unfortunatley it 's more an outpost of the german embassy / education guidance ... 
  / r/ukpolitics is more like the small union sub, 
  that 's where milania is from , right ? 
   one set is objectively bette it 's just that we now have one set ... and you would like to deviate from it . 
  it most likely does . 
  what makes the relevance of the us$ other than the amount of claims denominated in the currency, 
   everyone has what the uk offers that would mean to reduce the rights of uk expats in europe ... which is n't the idea ... especially as that also would reduce their rights in comparison to other eu citizens ... which would be at least legally challenging . 
  the bar set is the rights of european citizens ... not that of uk citizens . 
   fx rate is not the topic . 
  obviously it 's not - i just gave you a similar argument . 
  so let 's reduce it to the effects of a eurozone surplus : the amount of euro claims towards countries with foreign currencies increases , which increases the relevance of the currency , and most likely also it 's value , at least it decreases it 's volatility . 
  nothing earth-shattering ... but basically a plus . 
   different rights to uk citizens . 
  which ? 
  sure it 's not ... that is n't the point though . 
  going along your line i could also state `` without germany the euro would be 0,8 $ / $ '' . 
   non-germans do not have control over the german cas why should they ? 
  i also never said that . 
  i just said the money supply increases with a surplus . 
  which basically is a positive thing . 
  so to cut through all those `` exceptions '' : `` equal rights '' is not acceptable to the uk ... which is not acceptable to the eu . 
  the uk `` exceptionalism '' shines brightly ... 
  noone said the german gouvernment `` created it '' , everyone says that we can reduce it though . 
  and not by changing the whole business model - just by spending money . 
  so i think we completely agree . 
  did you actually read the `` art of the deal '' ? 
  ... just asking ;-), 
  that 's a very unique point of view . 
  first - it is a nice narrative to `` save now for the future '' ... which basically is not happening ... instead we introduce a `` m\u00fctterrente '' and other fancy promises . 
  second : at a time the interest rate is below zero every spend cent has litterally a positive return on invest . 
  and the `` zeor space to wriggle '' would be easily done by spending a fuckton of money on education and infrastructure . 
  why accept it ?
