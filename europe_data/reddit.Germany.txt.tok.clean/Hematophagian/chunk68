  you buy stuff produced in euro-zone : money gets in . 
  you buy stuff produced overseas : money leaves . 
  when 1  2 you have more money left . 
  the 8 % surplus represents a whole lot of jobs and companies ... 
  would `` equal rights '' not be a perfect compromise ? 
  so why fall short here ? 
  depends on perspective . 
  from a currency point of view ( euro ) absolutely yes . 
  more money is paid towards the eurozone than vice versa . 
  so the euro gathers more weight . 
  in this case the `` needs of the global economy '' and `` the needs of the local business '' is the same ... and the stability of the eu/global economy too . 
  it 's a question of target hierarchy . 
   we bring money into the eurozone we are responsible for a eurozone surplus towards non-eurozone countries . 
  so it 's a euro-surplus too . 
  question : will the uk delegates be part of the final vote ? 
  thorough analysis and final verdict : we need to spend a fuckton of more money . 
  i used to have the usual arguments ready since ever : * we just build better cars and stuff * we bring money into the eurozone * the surplus towards eu-countries is shrinking while all of these hold truth ... it 's not enough and would boil down to :  it is sometimes argued that germany 's surplus is simply an aggregation of a multitude of rational private decisions ; the surplus is not a matter of concern for policy . 
  were this the case , macroeconomics as a subject would be moribund , the only purpose being to provide a statistical record -- let individual decisions aggregate as they might , let the poker chips fall as they may !,

  if brussels has any intention of moving one of the city of london 's trading jewels to continental europe after brexit , it will need to move mountains -- or at least mountains of fibre optic cables . 
  a study by the european central bank on wednesday concluded that the undersea cables , usually about the diameter of a skateboard wheel , are a critical factor in determining the competitive strength of financial centres . 
  wresting euro currency trading from london after the uk 's exit from the eu 2019 will involve building a similarly-sized network of cables on the continent , the ecb determined . 
  the ecb 's decision to examine moving euro currency trading from london , the world 's largest foreign exchange trading hub , adds another potentially divisive issue to brexit negotiations that only recently got under way . 
  the uk capital accounts for about 43 per cent of foreign transactions involving the euro , the ecb estimated in a wider report about the role of the single currency . 
  but while the ecb has already moved to assist a european commission proposal that could force euro clearing to the continent , the study warns that the physical limitations is likely to make a similar shift for euro clearing slow if not impossible . 
  `` the findings are consistent with anecdotal evidence gleaned from market participants that london 's trading cables and wider pull , combined with institutional inertia , mean that any shift to mainland europe after brexit would be gradual , '' the study said . 
  electronic trading has transformed the forex market , allowing investors and companies to exchange millions between continents in fractions of a second . 
  but , as the ecb acknowledged , the city 's big inbuilt advantage was the laying of submarine fibre-optic cables in the 1980s that carry the majority of internet traffic . 
  financial centres next to oceans have an advantage `` because they are directly connected to the internet backbone , at the expense of landlocked cities like zurich '' , the study reported . 
  `` by one estimate , cable connections have boosted the share in global turnover of london , the world 's largest trading venue , by as much as one-third . '' about 8,000 miles of cables emerge from the seas around the uk at locations such as crooklets beach and sennen cove in cornwall , and highbridge in somerset . 
  in addition , traders and bankers have long recognised london 's location as the best place to capture most of the global trading day . 
  each hour 's difference in timezone relative to the us , uk or japan -- the main global trading hubs -- lowers the share of offshore trading of a country 's own currency by 12 percentage points , it found . 
  another point in london 's favour is that unlike equities , bonds or derivatives , the $ 1.7tn-a-day cash foreign exchange markets are not risk-managed through clearing houses but instead settled via london-based cls international bank . 
  the eurozone had just 8 per cent of global currency trading , according to a study published last year by the bank for international settlements the majority of europe 's critical infrastructure for trading forex , as well as shares and derivatives , is clustered in a 30-mile radius around the city . 
  in spite of the uk 's future , some of the industry 's biggest data centre operators , which host banks and high-frequency traders ' it equipment , have announced capacity increases this year to cope with rising demand from investors in both asia and the us . 
  nevertheless europe is still considering whether to relocate clearing of euro-denominated derivatives , which rely on managing the risk of daily price changes on contracts that can be open for many weeks or months , and is less dependent on submarine cables . 
  this would suggest lisboa as the perfect replacement , although not mentioned .

  i give you 50 % truth - but we just hide the `` winner '' - thing in nice euphemisms . 
  the other 50 % though is realizing , that if everyone else bleeds and suffers - we wo n't have fun in `` winning '' . 
  not realizing `` winning '' - only is not a sustainable approach looks like this : https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/27/trump-first-budget-us-foreign-aid,

  nah ... / r/de and / r/germany did that all on their own !, 
   soft brexit think of ceta with further exceptions for companies having a internationl supply chain ( auto-industry ) and some fast-track approval of service/financial products ( obviously not without a eu-based office ) . 
  all of that remains to be seen on how the divorce goes along before all that .

  10 % of fish in uk territory is fished by nonuk vessels,

  80 % of the sales are .
