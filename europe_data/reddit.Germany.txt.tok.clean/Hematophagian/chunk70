  beer yes ; wine maybe ,  35 % no . 
  did n't it say `` advanced '' ? 
  it 's mostly this book : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465043089 as i said - no evidence ... plausible reasoning, 
  wow username, 
  twitter is an endless source ... : https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/869254818946207744/photo/1 i would have posted it ... if not for twitter-links get auto-deleted, 
  the drug addiction is mostly proven , the gay thing has at a valid reasoning . 
  my greek friend . 
  let a german explain it to you : india : 2,07 bn gdp , 7,6 % increase , 1.3 bn people . 
  huuuuge market - if you have something to export . 
  after all someone has to give all those loans ;-) ps : if you consider downvoting me - think about your ability to endure a swipe taken - for a laugh . 
  there are several books on that topic suggesting that you mmight actually be right : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexuality_of_adolf_hitler, 
  yeah ... put that 30bn carriergroup right in front of sylt . 
  that wouldnt stop them to uphold quotas . 
  zerg ... 
  me neither . 
  but then i saw this : https://youtu.be/ss9ygqqql2q shes got an impressive voice, 
  the river was the border at this place . 
  radical transparancy :  ` who did mr carney buy greek yogurt for at the vip lounge at heathrow on january 21 , 2015 -- or were the two portions for him ? 
  where was mr carney travelling to ? '  the governor was travelling to the world economic forum in davos ( see published diary ) . 
  there is no recorded information held by the bank in relation to the yoghurts . 
  probably not to sell weapons to extreme regimes ? 
  ( trump/saudi show with 110bn deal ) although stopping to sell them weapons wo n't hinder them to support extremist views , i guess . 
   meet their 2 % obligation . 
  besides greece noone does in the eu ( and they cheated ... again ... by lowering the gdp ), 
   it should be placed in an eastern member of the eu . 
  from a purely strategic pov this would n't be all to wise ... putting your hq close to the most likely frontline ... not saying it is likely ... just the most likely one . 
  silicon valley has 30bn venture cap . 
  germany 3bn, 
  you sure ? 
  was n't there one before ? 
   more nurses from our country are there any unemployed english nurses ? 
  i heard about a general shortage ? 
  stealth capability, 
  der spiegel is owned by its employees . 
  you are absolutely right . 
  dear and teuer seem to have the same origin anyway . 
  on a side note : `` teuer '' has two meanings here . 
  `` expensive '' and `` dear '' . 
  au contraire . 
  this brings money into the eurozone, 
  ca n't see those under threat ( check eg the journalism freedom index ) ... while the seperation of powers is under siege in several eastern european countries . 
  wonder how long that headline was stored for furture usage ... 
  on a side note : * on a seasonally adjusted basis , the trade surplus fell to eur 19.6 billion from eur 21.2 billion in february , as exports rose 0.4 percent and imports jumped 2.4 percent . 
  and a pony !, 
  how else could such art be created : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guernica_ ( picasso ), 
   there is literally 0 air defense in the rest of syria . 
  an ss300 has a range up to 400km ... i think the russians have pretty muich covered all of syria ... if they so wanted . 
  the list of countries in which this is a crime is quite long : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial it 's also a crime in slovakia btw ... * slovakia in slovakia , holocaust denial is crime since 2001 ( law 485/2001 ) , and in new crime law ( 300/2005 ) it is specified in part \u00a7 422d : `` who publicly denies , denies , approves or tries to justify the holocaust , crimes of regime based on fascist ideology , crimes of regime based on communist ideology or crimes other similar movements that use violence , threat of violence or threat of other serious harm with aim of suppression of fundamental rights and freedoms persons shall be punished by imprisonment of six months to three years '' . 
   horst k\u00f6hler was n't even close to right-wing, 
  guys ... it was a / s comment ... but thanks for all the insight anyway !, 
  germany does, 
  no - they want the households to finance the windmills . 
  soooo more pollution means less warming ? 
  would a coal rctor be more on the plus side for polluting , or on the minus for blasting co2 ? 
  asking for a befriended nation . 
  spiegel already mentioned that this will most likely happen . 
  obviously the bundeswehr has to come up with alternative bases in 2 weeks . 
  the ecb has not much to do with eurobonds - at least not with the political will/decision to introduce them . 
  and the tool `` low interest rates '' and `` eurobonds '' are technically two completely different tools supporting different outcomes . 
  the introduction of eurobonds is the first ( and irreversable ) step into a transfer union . 
  and while i absolutely support this step , it will not work without control , which best could be implemented by a fiscal union ( and some additional stuff ) , or at least with a strict framework or control . 
  it most likely needs also a change in european contract framework . 
  ( and we know what that takes ... at the very least a lot of time ) . 
  basically offering eurobonds is like opening the honeypot - i 'd like to see the bears behaving reasonable at the pot ... and not afterwards complaining about stomach ache , because they ate too much ... 
  i also assume , that at current interest rates , it would not offer that much leverage anyway . 
  the italians 10y bond is 2.27 % ... loweing it to 0.95 % for eurobond would not make the world suddenly all pink and shiny . 
  berlin is dirtpoor compared to munich ... 
  i can not get the right peoples for open positions anymore ... its frustrating . 
  german labour market of skilled professionals with some knowledge is swept empty . 
  i would assume oligopoly, 
  hans builds robots at kuka ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kuka ), 
   to go public no - bosch ( 370k employees , 70.6 bn turnover ) is one of the biggest example ... and they are family-owned . 
  it 's not an either or . 
  i o u, 
  those companies prodeuce the tools to automate ... they will be on the winning side of it . 
  the grade will be adjusted with more information coming in ;-), 
  on a side note - i did quote an englishman : https://twitter.com/jackmcd83/status/859310132513169408, 
  me living in the uk would be an expat ... 
  except they are n't different concepts ... till exit it is by definition and by law the exact same thing . 
  i would doubt that the dark blue dot in the eastern mid corner ( = dresden ) has such a high purchasing power . 
  the perspective is revealing . 
  * europeans in uk : `` immigrants '' * uk citizens in europe : `` expats '', 
  to split 500, 
  always linking to this very good summary on `` who said what when '' about this `` allowed to flood '' claim : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?st=j16jlei6&amp;sh=16c7115f, 
   because apparently links to rt instantly remove your comment rightly so, 
  thank god at least the far-right terrorists are mainly stupid beyond believe ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horst_mahler from left terrorist to full nazi in 28years . 
  basically it 's like a sphere of politics . 
  if you go far enough to one side - you come around the other far-side ;-), 
  this !, 
  you mean those polish camps ? 
  naah - just kidding . 
  honestly - noone forgets about the others . 
  but this remembrance day was literally introduced by law by the israelis . 
  and a lot of jews have been polish jews . 
  so it was not a deliberate exclusion - just the fact that this is not a remembrance day introduced by the polish people . 
  interestingly enough today is also the yom hashoah in israel ( or worldwide ) to remember the holocaust : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yom_hashoah, 
  question of perspective . 
  if you see europe as one nation it 's a european nationalism we fight for . 
  and as nationalism always does distinguish against others - it 's the other continents , big players one wants to set itself apart ... and the uk ;-),
