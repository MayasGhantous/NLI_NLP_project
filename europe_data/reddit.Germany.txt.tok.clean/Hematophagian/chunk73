  shhhh - not much longer for you ... all will be fine on the island . 
  that 's mitterands personal shrine , is n't it ? 
  i got the feeling that he is a pragmatic guy ... and the problems seem evident . 
   but i do n't trust a banker like marcon it took bismarck to invent public healthcare ... or nixon to go to china . 
  trump : got struck down several decrees by court erdogan : which court ? 
  trump : democrats decline to clear cabinet erdogan : which opposition ? 
  review my ass !, 
  first realize access for all eu-members !, 
  when everyone else keeps failing it 's easy to shie .

   the drivers need to obey the rules , not uber . 
   they might be hit later on if international creditors wo n't trust greece anymore and wo n't loan them money , although that 's an unlikely scenario . 
  the second they default the banks close down - immediately . 
   the us is not protectionist against the eu . 
  the us is a massive importer of goods and services made in the eu . 
  as of now ... but if navarro and mnuchin get on to do trumps bidding this might change ... drastically, 
  there surely is an `` in-between '' option . 
  make it public , hold 50,1 % . 
   forced to take the soon to be overpriced and shoddy quality trains . 
  is n't that already the state they are in ? 
  as of now the ose has ( halfyear ) : * 9.8 mn revenue ( ?? ), 
  * 129.7 mn costs ( ?????????????????????????????? ), 
  the last `` public debt '' 10y bond had an interest rate of 25 % at the peak in 2012 ... 
  if they could find someone taking over the public train company - they would save a fortune . 
  besides - having public run airport deteriorating ovrtime because no investments are done is n't the best idea either . 
  you think that is likely ? 
  under any form of uk cabinet ? 
   soft brexit i doubt there is such a thing . 
  and even if - it hardly depends on the uk gouvernment . 
  but most of all - the only thing that has an impact as thourough as the other elections would be withdraw \u00a7 50 ... which has a probability of 0,01 % ? 
  maybe ? 
  that 's ... actually true based on those numbers ... 
  what impact could a uk election have , compared to the german and especially to the french one ? 
  the last one could end the eu , the german one could shift european politics to the left , but the uk election ? 
  you won the pot - snapped . 
   and why would they then pretend to be islamists ? 
  that one would be all too logical . 
  every islamist attack helps the far-right . 
  edit : gauland ( afd ) once said `` you might like boateng as a player - but people would n't like to have him as a neighbour ... '' http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/afd-vize-gauland-beleidigt-jerome-boateng-14257743.html, 
  this competent website says so : http://www.deadoraliveinfo.com/dead.nsf/enames/elizabeth+queen+ii, 
  withdraw \u00a7 50 ? 
  that would be hillarious though, 
  why ? 
  the weaker the workers rights are , the less the demand is , the less you need temporary constructs . 
   but why would they target a football bus as dortmund is quite a `` colorful '' team and always prsented the fact as a source of pride , there could be a link between far right and multi-cultural soccer team . 
  maybe refer it to the human rights council of the un . 
  saudi-arabia might have an opinion here ... 
   ramstein airbase is an important base of operations for american war efforts in the middle east and africa . 
  oh i know that - one might say it is irreplacable . 
  but as of now no isis-linked attack had such a specific demand coming with it . 
  it always was `` kill infidel !, 
  '' - themed . 
  there also never was a precisley named onjective , besides `` do not bomb us infidel ! '' . 
  the letter said to `` close ramstein airbase '' . 
  seems unlikely for daesh . 
  well technically that is correct ... as the new home has n't been decided yet . 
  ... technically the swimming pools on the titanic are fully functional to the current day too ... 
  pre-brexit uk : `` the surplus destroys europe `` post-brexituk : `` now it destroys the world ``, 
  merkozy ... they merged, 
  helmut schmidt / giscard d'estaing, 
  i 'm one of those guys fighting easy answers ... that 's what everybody seems to fall for nowadays . 
  ok . let 's take the island vormsi . 
  91sqkm , seems fine . 
  would you like to start the process ? 
  tell us , when the island would be ready , and what money you would need . 
   i just hope there are still sane people in this country . 
  not enough, 
  the `` buy your citizenship '' is a scheme run by many countries . 
  malta 's citizenship is at 300k , greece at 250k . 
  alright - besides the fact that this is on a completely different scale , what we would need is an island . 
  which one would you like to use for that detention centers ? 
  so let 's run this through from a practical point of view . 
  we are mid-sea , encountering an overload ship at the `` sea border '' . 
  the border guard ( which is actually more or less a policeman ) will do what now ? 
   how about making the society friendlier to younger ( native obviously , otherwise why bother ) people trying to start a family ? 
  there are over 200 tax reductions , regulations , incentives , etc. 
  to favour families with children . 
  it 's not leading to an increase as of now . 
  it 's not that nobody sees the problem , it 's that the we need to reshape the perceiption and the working culture , which is n't done overnight . 
  wheres the border in your example ? 
  3 more days ... then hopefully he will either shut up , or cross the red line of ranting to be finally ignored . 
  sadly yes, 
  so you want to be the one ordering a police man to shoot people based on what exactly ? 
  additional question : before they drown , or after - just to be sure , you know . 
  when you think about the development - every winter is better than starving or get shot . 
  which ones ? 
  they proposed something along the lines `` can we please stay back , but keep the privileges ? '', 
  i 'm talking about `` can we please move forward without everyone interfering ? 
  if it works out , we would be happy you join '', 
  this attitude should expel you directly from eu, 
   ratified by all the other countries too 2-speed europe 4 the win, 
  all to build roads in spain !, 
  for the us nato is just a tool , they might use it if they find it convenient ( ... 9/11 ) or they want to expand their influence . 
  for many other countries it 's a protection gurantee ( which we all know the us would n't need anyway ) . 
  there is not much use in exiting the nato , but reading a statement like tillersons it seems to be very necessary to tell him the us should for once neither come too late , nor run away too early ... in all honesty - i can not remember some event where the us did n't do one of thoose . 
  why ? 
  this has n't to do all too much with nato , but everything with the us policy . 
   so where are the proposals tons of it : http://voxeu.org/article/building-common-fiscal-policy-eurozone https://www.ft.com/content/95aaddfa-29ad-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89 the blockers mainly have been the uk ( yeah !, 
  ) , the french are vocal about the tax thing . 
  i 'm making second place ... what did i win ?
