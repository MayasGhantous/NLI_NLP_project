   not a very convincing argument to this american tax payer honestly i 'm pretty sure that the us pushed for the nato-membership eraly on ... so it 's not really `` our '' mess we 're talking about . 
  besides i actually recall the nice leak and the attitude it exposed . 
  seemed the us wanted to run the whole show in the if not in the `` tax-payers name '' , but in their interest : http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-regime-change-operation-in-ukraine-exposed-in-leaked-diplomatic-phone-call/5367807 and i can not recall the us lost much trade due to sanctions either . 
  so basically this is again messing things up and running away - a very american pattern as far as i see it . 
  had to test it , right ? 
  ;-) keep up the good work !, 
  it 's neither a thing nor a person , right ? 
  he was there when they opened it - it was also due to a public vote . 
  and the pun - as you see it 's called `` bud bad '' ( bad = pool ) : http://www.pipeline.de/pipeline/showpics.php?id=10389914_l&amp;rid=1, 
  there is a swimming pool named after him in germany : https://www.stwgd.de/bud-spencer-bad.html, 
   broken eurozone system so why not fix the system instead of upping the money we throw at the broken one ? 
  fiscal union , tax harmonization first . 
   until germany accepts its responsibility and accepts the steps needed to bring an end to the invisible crisis absolutely ... and i ca n't even see where germany does not accept this , while calling for closer intgegration ... but eurobonds is the last step of this process ... not the first one . 
   interesting premise . 
  is it a robin hood story ? 
  no ... it 's a spoiled brat story , which makes it even better - noone has any morale highground, 
   german voters have consistently backed merkel 's stance . 
  a european union survey in november found that germany has the least public backing for so-called euro bonds among eu countries , with just 24 percent saying they were in favor . 
  that compared with 55 percent support in portugal and 50 percent in greece . 
  quelle surprise !, 
  not that we forget : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26072281, 
  it 's astounding that there is not one mention of the devastating effct it would have on the uks rating ... not paying bills is a sure shot at downgrade . 
  piig or east europe ... choose wisely, 
  fog in the channel ... continent cut off, 
  from a consumer point of view : good . 
  from a business point of view : they are evil incarnated . 
  they tell there suppliers face2face that they can not make profit on deals with lidl - they should rather be glad to have a scale effect and by that make profit . 
  pretty much .

  besides the tax evasion and the money-laundering , many bankers and investors keep insisting that the panama-model would be necessary for completely legal purposes . 
  what are those anyway ? 
  since now i heard : * securing funds from unsecure legal systems in 3rd world countries ( uuuh - delaing with blodd-diamonds ? ), 
  * flagging out ships in a country ( really ? 
  this must be the 0.000001 % edge case ),

  this year is 500th commemoration of martin luthers reformation , so we get one more . 
  absolutely . 
  here have some evidence from the original newspaper 1939 : `` poland answers peace negotiations with ambush '' http://www.ar-show.de/markuslaymann/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/11/zeitung-640x276.jpg any f\u00fcrther questions ? 
  ftfy : minister writes racist comments, 
  he was actually first . 
  nope russian : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_rimon_20, 
  as the idf was the only modern air force that ever shot down several migs this seems either unlikely or very appropriate . 
  the fight btw happened 1970 when f4/mirage shot down 5 russian mig21 over egypt . 
  on a side note : 430bc wiki-entry : greece * the army of sparta loots attica for a second time , but pericles is not daunted and refuses to revise his initial strategy . 
  unwilling to engage the spartan army in battle , he again leads a naval expedition to plunder the coasts of the peloponnesus , this time taking 100 athenian ships with him . 
  * potidaea finally capitulates to the siege by athenian forces in the winter . 
  * an outbreak of a plague hits athens and the disease ravages the densely packed city ( modern dna analyses of material from ancient cemeteries suggest the mortal disease may have been typhus ) . 
  the plague wipes out over 30,000 citizens , sailors and soldiers as well as pericles ' two sons . 
  roughly one quarter of the athenian population dies . 
  the fear of plague is so widespread that the spartan invasion of attica is abandoned , their troops being unwilling to risk contact with the diseased enemy . 
  * pericles becomes ill from the plague but he recovers , temporarily . 
  he is deposed from his position as general ( or strategos ) , but is later reappointed . 
  remember the scene from `` a bridge too far '' , when the english major refuses to accept the capitulation of the germans , because he could not provide for such a large force , while he was left with like 20 soldiers and the german offered him to surrender ? 
  edit : found it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-li65p_3lvm, 
  this is golden ... though as a german we kind of quit the mentioned alert level path from `` invade a neighbour '' . 
  not to encourage anyone , but i invite fellow europeans to define a new alert level for germany ( and no - let thyself be invaded is n't valid ), 
  put it on a train . 
  worked last time with the whole guy . 
  general rule : as long as a fucking commercial airliner can reach the city to deport your ass , you should not claim asylum coming from there . 
  that said : try to fly to aleppo, 
  you 'd better be a hair-model then ... 
  what would you do at a party with shitty music ? 
  they should show us a german not worshipping cars ... 
  greece can do whatever they like to do ... just do n't receive money for it . 
  they guy paying the party chooses the music they say . 
  coming from a uae news agency ... agenda much ? 
  imagine the sun in arabic ... 
  could he please himself board one of those boats and paddle it back to ... well - lybia ? 
  hey ... `` hippie state '' ... that 's a new one . 
  common fiscal system , opponents : basically all . 
  especially france , ireland , uk , luxenbourg , austria , netherlands . 
  go convince them . 
  see ? 
  first control - then money flow . 
  never deied the fact - i denied the wages , which are nowhere stated btw . 
  cmon - i usually read your comments with pleasure , because you always have a balanced view . 
  but this one is a little `` devils advocat '' . 
  he wants a redistribution , just as we have one on a federal level : bayern paying bremen . 
  not difficult to understand . 
  the reason why we do not want this , is we have no saying in the spending ... ( see above ) . 
  the doctors earning 6k net in germany ( which is probably 11k gross ) are quite rare ... i would say extremly rare . 
  the problem does not go away if we did build a hungary-style wall and deny asylum ( which is not possible btw . ), 
  the fact that germany is `` pro-asyl '' comes from the pure fact , that there are no other valid options . 
  pushing them back to greece/italy ? 
  impossible . 
  i always wonder if the refugees did in fact increase since the `` no pushing back '' announcement , or if they just stayed the same anyway . 
  the `` asylum-friendliness '' is a consequence ... not an origin . 
  the `` pushing '' ca n't be done `` by force '' . 
  not denying that the influence is large , but honestly there are several examples where german interests are overruled . 
  ecb is one of those . 
  draghi and merkel basically hate each other . 
  germany is not opposed to fiscal redistribution ( while it 's actually debatable if we do not already have those via eu-budget ) . 
  it strongly opposes this idea with out the rule-sets . 
  obviously you can not convince the electorate to give money to other countries while they decrease tax on companies ( ireland ) , waste it on obscure projects ( greece ) , or basically win elections . 
  so before eurobonds/redistribution we need a common taxation , common fiscal framework and common rules .
