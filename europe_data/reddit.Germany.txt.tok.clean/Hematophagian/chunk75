  the same system is in use in germany between the federal states btw . 
  the solution provided by you ( although i kind of agree ) is not reached with money - but with blood of soldiers ... that 's the hard part . 
  cause we are not an island ... shutting the door to a channel seems much easier, 
  for all the wrongdoings by many players in the past ( from the uk drawing borders with a ruler , the us attacking iraq without a plan , the alliance bombing lybia without a plan to mingling with saudi-arabia and uae ) there really should be a discussion about syria and the options to bring this country back to `` liveable '' . 
  so which stakeholders do we have ? 
  * assad/russia * iran * isis * saudi-arabia * al-nusra * ypk/pkk/peshmerga as the kurds front * some democratic movements `` syria opposition '' * turkey , with it 's own agenda * iraq - with no plan at all * us * europe one option would be to clear syria through a un force ( basically nato ) , which would be strongly opposed by at least russia . 
  ( and needs a lot of convincing in european states ) another would be to just clear anything that is abandoned by assad - basically the isis . 
  this would be opposed by turkey - it 's one step towards a united kurdistan . 
  then we could throw in `` 3rd party forces '' , like saudi-arabia - which would be strongly opposed by iran and probably iraq . 
  we could settle for even smaller safety zones - turkey has to be paid for something like this , i guess - but maybe they would go along . 
  kind of the `` golan heights '' of northern syria . 
  most probable approach . 
  any further ideas ? 
  ... they did not . 
  they just forbid to deport refugees there . 
  german courts declared situation for refugees inhumane in italy , greece and other countries . 
  it was dead long before . 
  renzi and tsirpas said it long before . 
  obviously yes, 
  i said this before : the only statement that was made by merkel is '' we do not push back refugees to first registry countries anymore-dublin 2 is dead '' thats far from `` everyone come here '' , though i do not blame anyone turning the narrative into this . 
  anyway : solution has to be viable for italy and greece . 
  correct . 
  seems though greece is a little bit overwhelmed . 
  might need some european solidarity . 
  the coat of civilization is very thin on humans ... 
  sweden ... cant even proper do nationalism . 
  never once they stated muslim or migrant ... 
  thats why i said so . 
  your quote did mention moral decrees . 
  uncomfortable ... although i cant remember if i ever sung it . 
  sounds like benedict . 
  german after all ... 
  you could argue its a moral issue though, 
  isnt the pope by definition unable to be wrong ? 
  iraq, 
  that 's obvious - so just take half of germany ;-), 
  poland eg will have a rapid population decline too the next years . 
  nope ... propably going to kurdistan, 
  press officer : tim allen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqjzk3qql4k, 
  is n't there a `` middle ground '' possible in sweden ? 
  i thought they were all `` russians '', 
  would n't be so sure there . 
  the regulations that apply for eg norway are quite strict . 
  if the uk would confront them , there might be some backslash . 
  have to give it to them : clever move . 
  i take it , from your phrasing that you are such a mentally disadvantaged person , that you are basically unable to distinguish religion , culture , ethnic groups , social groups and therefore manifested a concept of thinking that 's easy to grip and does not challenge your mind too much . 
  therefore i 'll do 2 things : 1 . ), 
  read michel houellebecq `` submission '' , which absolutely will support your concept , while at the same time challenges the way you reached it . 
  ( hint : it 's a complex book - most likely you will give up after 10pages ) 2 . ), 
  stop communicating with you, 
  i 'd like you to know that if this is your honest opinion , i would strongly encourage you leaving . 
  the second part about merkel is spot on !, 
  if there would be a exact answer we would not need a referendum ... as a german : * hurts , because we will have a bigger share to pay * hurts , because all disruption of trade hurts germany * hurts , because one less voice to balance * helps , because fuck the constant complaining and special treatment * helps , because yes we will finally be able to move ahead towards an `` ever closer union '' * uncertain , because we will see the effect of `` leaving '' in this little experiment * uncertain , because uk will inevitably move closer to us ( lap dog syndrome ) - unsure what that will lead to . 
  going to inject additional 3-6 .6 bn to `` local demand '' this year . 
  either 33 or 37, 
  ... damn my french is rusty . 
  as a german : i 'm deeply sorry my dutch friends ... i would have really loved to watch another dutch-german game ... 
  the friendly in november is just not the real thing ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owvkve6rli0, 
  i 'm an active follower of this subreddit - i can count them myself . 
  as i said - not a black/white scenario . 
  correct, 
  uk probably at 16.000 - last number that left camerons mouth . 
  if the only reason is `` for the jobs '' - then something went wrong long before . 
  syria was never a `` 3rd world shithole '' . 
  it was a developing country and looked quite prosperous : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/syria-heritage-in-ruins-before-and-after-pictures, 
  reminder : for french it would be `` salle boche '', 
  yeah right - but one small difference . 
  the bdi actually has thousands of job openings ... unable to fill them . 
  that 's not the case in france . 
  and filling the jobs that are there is hardly `` a race to the bottom '' . 
  milk ... the `` guranteed '' prices ended and the price is free fall . 
  problem : as soon as there is a set price : the production increases . 
  now it has to fall ... 
  the main reasons for isis are : * iraq snctions : dissolved pretty much the middle class * disbanding of iraq army : suddenly battle-hardened officers had nothing much to do ( and now pretty much are the core of isis ) * disbanding baht : the only party that could have handled sunni/shiit-balance * deserting iraqi resistance : first encouraged , then abandoned, 
  so how is it handled right now ? 
  i remember a lot of french people i dealt with and they all worked 50hr/week - for 30 weeks/year . 
  starting from september they suddenly vanished all and worked 4days/week ... 3days/week to balance their work hrs . 
  account on a year basis . 
  all the amazon-warehouses need drones anyway ;-), 
  see above - the `` open invitation '' never happened . 
  but i ca n't fault people for seeing it as that ... semantics . 
  ahem ... we do actually have a minimum wage since this year . 
  slaves ... i guess a slave is defined as anyone working 36hrs/week ? 
  i gon na watch it tonight - for reference : http://tvthek.orf.at/program/im-zentrum/6907623/im-zentrum-die-grenzen-europas-wohin-mit-den-fluechtlingen/10532818 ( not sure if blocked in other countries - hope i 'll find a austrian proxy ;-) ), 
  uhuuu ... `` the darkest time '' - you manage to throw such a sentence at a german in probably any context . 
  anyway - last time i checked your country ( admitting also germany ) was on a list the european courts will investigate for inhumane treating of refugees . 
  the amnesty int . 
  report does not look to favourable to hungary : https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur70/1579/2015/en/ but again : it 's pretty much the whole attitude towards the problem that makes hungary look bad . 
  let 's take the discussion `` one level up '' and generally think about a unified european approach . 
  all germany said was pretty much `` dublin2/3 is dead , we do n't push the refugees back to other countries anymore '' . 
  obviously that was transformed in a totally different narrative `` they want all to come to germany '' . 
  ca n't blame either side there . 
  orban and most of the other countries east of germany pretty much denied to have any other approach then just `` not my problem - the did n't land on my beach '' . 
  that is n't helpful ... at all . 
  germany did not listen to italy and greece for years - bad enough . 
  now it 's mostly the eastern europeans that still do n't listen - or make any substantial proposals , other then `` build wall '' . 
  we germans are n't that much for walls anymore . 
  and sure some part is the typical `` german 's guilt '' argument that comes into play . 
  what we all could do is define `` minimum requirements '' of asylum ( europeanwide ) , minimum standards for housing of refugees and a fair distribution . 
  wo n't happen overnight - but saying `` that 's germanys problem , we do n't want them '' is just despicable .
