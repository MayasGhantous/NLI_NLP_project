  you realize that you agreed to basic rules - which are actually endangered by the actions of pis ? 
  i mean if you all happen to favour the abolishment of democracy - you really could do this outside of europe , pretty please ? 
  i honestly ca n't comprehend what you want to say with this sentence . 
  is n't that called `` democracy ? '', 
  or do you have another understanding ? 
  ... after voting 51 members into it ... 
  45 % vs. 25 % seems to be a very clear majority to me ... hope / u/awerture did not introduce an alternative way of counting, 
  why is it `` eu parliament '' vs `` poland '' ? 
  here have a list of 51 polish members : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search.html?country=pl, 
  well the pictures of tens of thousands protesting it gave me the impression - but i have to admit i did n't see recent polls . 
  you happen to have one ? 
  well this is also the answer the pis wanted to hear , they themselves asked the venice comission : http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21694672-march-11th-venice-commission-will-look-changes-constitutional-tribunal-polands, 
  why so salty ? 
  * seriously concerned that the effective paralysis of the constitutional tribunal in poland poses a danger to democracy , human rights and the rule of law . 
  * is n't that exactly what is happening ? 
  and is n't it like most of poland agrees ? 
  just realized you are serious ... well in this case in the words of john cleese ( more or less ) : `` jehova , empire , empire , empire '', 
   political decisions is n't it worse to send terrorists for `` political reasons '' ? 
  seeing a german flag really drives you to say `` hitler '' , does n't it ? 
  for the interested : the `` bita '' is the india-eu trade agreement ( currently and since long ago ongoing negotiation ) . 
  there is a whole lot of unsolved discussion points - none of them would differ if the other party would be uk-only : http://thebricspost.com/eu-india-btia-a-modern-example-of-the-classic-north-south-divide/#.vw4ql5qltme, 
  you want to build a new empire on selling cheddar ? 
  the answers would probably range from `` lobby agenda '' via `` cultural and historical exposure to different systems '' to `` major restructuring , not feasible '' . 
  that 's why germany decided to do the worst : have both : public + private ... but only the wealthy are allowed to quit the public ... oh and one more : health insurance in switzerland is ( as far as i know ) not reduced to income from employment , but to all sorts or income . 
  while that is correct , they neither go point2point nor `` just-in-time '' . 
  and they usually do best when you load bulk - not a single palette with a washing machine on it . 
  not swiss - but the main differences are : * swiss public insurance is compulsary * swiss do not pay more than 8 % , they get a subsidy for the above costs * many costs are capped it is like putting the best of both worlds into a system - that 's why it is deamed superior to most other systems . 
  it is what obamacare would look like at `` its best '' version , or put simpler - take a public system and make private companies provide it . 
  here have a read : http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2011/04/29/why-switzerland-has-the-worlds-best-health-care-system/#56db3dd218af, 
  aaah comparisons - so much fun . 
  here have a comparison of sf/berlin ... just to make you laugh/whine - while people living there keep complaining ... : http://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/compare_cities.jsp?country1=germany&amp;country2=united+states&amp;city1=berlin&amp;city2=san+francisco%2c+ca&amp;tracking=getdispatchcomparison, 
  whops ... 185 it is . 
  correction is quite meta that way ;-), 
  \u00a7 158 stgb - let 's see how this turns out . 
   i just hope the eu survives . 
  it will - at the very least in a small version with some core countries - hopefully restarting from there . 
  absolutely - i would n't call it a coup . 
  mossadegh in iran was a coup , noriega was one . 
  this ? 
  was an `` agenda '' with `` alligning interests '' helping to `` engineer '' a change . 
  really ? 
  not in europe - and certainly not in the netherlands after last week ;-), 
  last week a common `` european asylum approach '' failed spectacularly because each country has it 's own agenda catered to their voters at home . 
  from now on i just use the words `` thanks kaczy\u0144ski '', 
  let 's say they both `` engineered '' this one together , while in no way trusting each other : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957, 
  hmmm : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buddhism_and_violence http://world.time.com/2013/06/20/extremist-buddhist-monks-fight-oppression-with-violence/, 
   it also makes me think less of you as a person . 
  not a problem , chris kyle . 
   i would advise that you avoid telling combat vets about ptsd in the future , you have no fucking idea what the fuck you 're talking about you started to get personal and even implied a threat . 
  was n't me . 
  if you struggle with ptsd i 'm sorry to hear - still : get yourself treated . 
  if anyone puts a gun in your face you are obviously allowed to do whatever it takes to stop him . 
  but if you preemptivley sacrifice all the principles a cilvilized society has achieved by just `` killing him with a bomb '' ( which was the whole threat about ) you 're doing it wrong ... the fact that a 14-yr old boasting about a terror attack gives people such goose-bumps is just ridiculous . 
   it breaks equality before law !, 
  to some extent this is true , and the specific law is debatable . 
  on the other side , it does put up a further barrier for prosecution in favour of the accused . 
  so if you would remove the need of her allowence , the offender would be more disadvantaged , therefore it does serve the purpose of protecting someone , not the other way round . 
  on a side note : as mr erdogan personally presses charges based on the basic `` insult '' law , the decision of mrs merkel if the prosecution for `` insulting foreign statesman '' would be allowed is kind of secondary . 
  the courts will decide if this is satire or not ... and i would bet a large amount that they will decide in favour . 
  i just hate it when someone comes along waving his `` combat experience '' around like his dick and tries to tell me `` no place for humanity in that split-second before the kill '' . 
  these people are deranged by war ... they fought for principles they abandon and trample on afterwards ... what a joke . 
  you got that wrong - it 's not up to her f he is punished , but if he is prosecuted . 
  the decision if he is guilty or not still happens at a court trial . 
  we do after all have a seperation of powers . 
   i would advise that you avoid telling combat vets about ptsd in the future , you have no fucking idea what the fuck you 're talking about ahahahaha ... so i hit the spot i guess . 
  now stop threatening me with your combat experience and get some xanax description , before your crawl out of your anarchy cave . 
  sure - as let 's say the bulgarian mafia , ruling the prostitution industry with an iron fist ? 
  or the belarus burglary rings ? 
  that just sounds funny coming from a bulgarian ... 
  see - that is exactly the problem . 
  you think the grievance of a former terrorist victim is the kids fault , and he should die for . 
  that 's revenge , or punishing a future crime . 
  both concepts are totally unacceptable . 
  and by killing him you do not save a single soul who passed . 
  that 's a stramen argument . 
  you either accept the basic principles of a human society in a civilized world , or you could just live in anarchy . 
  and not one sentence makes him less `` guilty '' of what he said , or what he proposed to do . 
  that 's what we got a police force and a court for ... and probably a doctor ... but under no circumsatnces a drone and a bomb , because that just worked out so well all the times before ... 
   you 're an idiot if you think that he 's no threat due to his age . 
  i never said that - i said that it is neither acceptable , nor reasonable to `` make someone throw a bomb on him '' . 
  this is not a war zone , we have a police , legal systems and a law . 
  if your answer to this threat is finding yourself in a comparable situation as back in afghanistan you have ptsd , get yourself treatment and leave the war behind . 
  sure it 's illegal - that does not make killing the kid the correct answer , or does it for you ? 
  if your only tool is a hammer , every problem seems to be a nail ... 
  well that was pretty-much the definition for even founding the afd ... before it kicked out it 's former founder and set a whole new agenda with proposing immigration . 
  certainly worse than usa , do n't you agree ? 
  also the country which leads the death toll in capital punishments ( as it is rumoured , because they do n't publish any statistics ), 
  what has this to do with sacrificing basic human rights ? 
  what good could come from killing kids ? 
  possibly more terror ? 
  you very much seemed to agree to the starting point of this sub-thread , which was `` take a drone and bomb them '' . 
  how else would you describe the '' ( if not for blowing them up ) ... what else would be your remedy '' . 
  that signals consent to the original statement . 
  `` retired '' ;-), 
  so you 're saying the wrong brother died ? 
  a 14year old kid frightens you ? 
  really ? 
  how old are you ? 
  it 's a kid - grab him by his collar put him over your foot and slap his ass with a ruler . 
  so now we not even jail , but kill people for future crimes without a trial ?
