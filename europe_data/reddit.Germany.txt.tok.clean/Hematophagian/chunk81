  that exactly what she is referring to . 
  she said `` yesterday they were some anonymous trolls , today we have real name authors stating racist comments ... and arson attacks '', 
  using the search function on reddit alone would probably provide a variety of `` sink the boats , let them drain '' comments . 
  that basically is murder . 
  about the right-wing : that is exactly what i mean - you ca n't shut people out by calling them `` right wingers '' at the slightest idea of restricting immigration . 
  this actually is especially true for germany where we call it the `` nazi-cudgel '' . 
  kind of gordons law . 
  ending a discussion before it began just by saying `` that 's nazi '' . 
  you can call islam all you want - but denying syrian refugees on the basis of fearmongering `` because they bring sharia '' is just as unreasonable as the above mentioned `` that 's nazi '' . 
  politics is compromise ... and noone is as good in this game as angie . 
  you should n't stop a discussion with the first shout of `` ca n't !, 
  could we please all stay intelligent and reasonable people ? 
  could we please start from the following common understanding ? 
  : * her comment was directly pointed at the increasing amount of hate speech , especially in social media , more and more so as not anonym , but real name authors wishing death ( in various forms ) to all foreigners entering the country for asylum or immigration . 
  * she also pointed out that as those comments actually are accompanied by real action ( arson , violence , etc. ), 
  decent people have to stand up against this hate speech . 
  * she did not say one word about the way to handle this crisis * we as germans , and we as europeans need to start a discussion about immigration and about asylum . 
  a rational , intelligent discussion . 
  * the status quo might still be workable but we walk into an unsustainable scenario knowingly , and noone has the guts to come up with good , fair and worable scenarios - especially not on european level . 
  * we as germans especially should be the ones who come up with ideas - a european quota system was one of them . 
  stopping immigration for economical reasons ( or better filtering it ) should be the next and fair distribution of refugees fleeing from war another one . 
  * noone should come up with the `` right wing '' argument to shut people out of the discussion preemptively . 
  * noone should be allowed to argue the case based on fearmongering about `` islamic culture kills our values '' , `` sharia is coming '' , `` they only want money '' . 
  * and finally if your real agenda is to kill persons or let them basically die ... say so . 
  we will then call you a racist murderer rightfully . 
  if you don not apply the somewhat national perspective of the french wikipedia-entry you will discover all of the `` special regions '' . 
  even germany got 2 of them ... : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/outermost_region, 
  without the iwf there will basically be no bailout agreeable . 
  especially more relevant after 23rd september 2014 !!!, 
  this is as old as it gets ... and therefore 100 % irrelevant . 
  remember the times when big mama bell was split up ? 
  the glory days of the usa ... 
  it can see them ... engage them ( like in `` missile away '' ) is something different . 
  one getting through is enough : http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/watch-these-russian-missiles-completely-tear-through-a-1636002082, 
  i did not wrte that - but in the linked discussion they go into detail about the `` shoot over shoulder '' idea : https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3emclt/tom_cruise_says_hes_in_for_top_gun_2_but_only_if/cthm1ji basically it 's still just a 70degree cone . . 
  obviously he never will ... but as good as it gets for a piefke . 
  [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3emclt/tom_cruise_says_hes_in_for_top_gun_2_but_only_if/cthm1ji ) convinced me otherwise ( courtesy of / u/rhino _ 4 ) : first , let 's talk about range . 
  `` hypothetically '' let 's assume the range of the aim-120 is what he says : 97 miles . 
  let 's further assume the range of 97 miles is from a full stop . 
  now fly . 
  now increase altitude . 
  your range just went up by 10 to 20 miles because you 're flying in up high in thinner air , and because the missile does n't have to start from a dead stop . 
  now let 's add a bad guy . 
  he 's flying directly at you and you 've somehow locked him up at the ridiculous range of 150 nautical miles . 
  because he 's flying at you , you can launch early , let 's say at 120 nautical miles , and by the time the missile gets there he 'll be in range . 
  except , the moment you locked him up , your radar went from passive to active . 
  he knows he 's being locked , and he knows which direction you 're in . 
  he immediately turns 90 degrees to the right or the left to find the `` notch '' and try to evade your radar . 
  because he 's turned , he 's slowing the rate at which you close with each other . 
  this increases the flight time of the missile and means that the missile you decided to shoot early is now useless and will not have enough energy to reach him . 
  now your effective missile range is nearly halved , down to around 45 to 55 miles . 
  at around 60 miles , he turns back towards you , but only enough to let the edge of his own radar cone find you . 
  he 's now traveling towards you with around a 30 degree offset , and because he 's increased the rate of closure between your two aircraft , he 's suddenly back in range . 
  you fire off another missile . 
  but when he turned towards you he locked you up and fired one of his own missiles . 
  let 's assume it 's an active radar guided missile like the aim-120 . 
  this means that both you and he must maintain radar contact with each other until the missile is around 15 to 20 miles away from the target and the missiles onboard radar comes online and begins tracking on its own . 
  the aim-120 is n't exactly fire-and-forget , you see . 
  you have to use your own radar to guide it towards the target until the missile 's radar is close enough to see the target on its own . 
  do you both keep traveling towards each other in order to maintain lock ? 
  imo that would be a pretty dumb move with missiles heading right at you . 
  instead you move to put the bad guy on the edge of your own radar and keep the distance as far as possible for as long as possible . 
  because you two are n't directly flying at each other any more , your rate of closure decreases again and now he 's just baaaarely out of range . 
  guess your second missile is a dud too . 
  hopefully his does n't have more range than yours . 
  from here it gets incredibly complicated , and there 's so many different scenarios that could happen , trying to explain them all would take hours . 
  instead , just take my word for it , that modern jets can and do close to within visual range . 
  sometimes the missile game gets played out . 
  sometimes you have to close for visual confirmation before you start shooting at random things in the sky that may or may not be a bad guy . 
  sometimes your forced to turn completely away from the bandit and by the time you get back around you see him visually flying below or above you before you even get a chance to search with your radar . 
  either way you 're now in visual range . 
  that could be anywhere from 1 to 15 miles depending on the atmospheric conditions . 
  jets are big . 
  you can see them from a reeeaally long ways off . 
  bvr is awesome , do n't get me wrong , but it 's not the only way to fly . 
  secondly let 's talk about dogfighting . 
  you 've got aim-9s and your guns for close combat . 
  your aim-9 has a range of around 15 miles , and a minimum range of 1 mile . 
  the author makes that seem incredibly far away , but believe me , in a jet , a mile is only a few seconds of flight time . 
  did i mention you can see another jet from around 15 miles away ? 
  at one mile , that jet looks like you can reach out and poke it with your finger , and it 's moving incredibly fast . 
  at short ranges , it becomes a turning fight to get behind your opponent where he ca n't shoot you and you can shoot him . 
  the author mentions shooting behind you with a missile . 
  just ... listen ... he 's full of shit . 
  you still need to get a lock with your aim-9 and since it 's a heat seeking missile , that means you need to point it at an enemy jet before you can fire it . 
  it has the equivalent of a fish-eye lens for seeking , but you still need to point your nose within x degrees of another aircraft for your missile to see anything . 
  the author also asserts that the f-22 has poor maneuvering abilities . 
  that 's horse shit . 
  it has a sustained turning radius of around 28 degrees a second . 
  most other jets ca n't come close to that . 
  so , do modern jets still come within visual range in a war ? 
  read : [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_engagements_of_the_gulf_war ), 
  not correct . 
  besides they started with missiles . 
  even easier to access oil, 
  i lived in berlin 2001 . 
  i know how that looks like .
