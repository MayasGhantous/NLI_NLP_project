  not the german . 
  just overcomplicated . 
  tomorrow it will rain frogs ... wait and see nonbelievers !, 
  same tax system . 
  firend of mine , who also was present , just came back from 2-years in vienna and did this accent to perfection - so we all switched ... or better tried to . 
  was kind of a running gag throughout the holiday . 
  correct ... but white lace-panties on brown skin ... just could n't hold back . 
  ... while it 's actually french ;-) germans never buy french cars :p, 
  as a german standing behind a ( marvelous black ) girl where white panties are clearly visible , faking an austrian accent , stating something like `` mocht mi gonz wuild '' ( makes one pretty horny ) in spain on a ferry to maroc ... when suddenly the guy next to the girl ( having a maghreb look ) turns around and talks to me in german `` stop that shit - you 're about to enter a muslim country , show some decency '' ... ... lost words there . 
  well ... we didnt do irak though . 
  just wondering : where there any landmasses that are n't here today ? 
  plenty of monkeys who will ... and at appointing monkeys greece has quite a reputation to defend ;-) now that was a stereotypical offense ... downvote now if you ca n't handle the joke . 
  all this will not `` unmake '' the reality , that if you want someone competent doing this job you have to pay a competitive wage . 
  everything else is socialism ... which usually does not lead to competent people doing their jobs ... no ideological favourites here . 
  oh and yes ... the world is unfair . 
  you can rant all you want . 
  a member of the board of a bank comes at a price - rightfully so or not . 
  the price varies between probably 500k/year to 500000k/year ... this one costs 218k/year ... choose now . 
  as far as i understood they resigned because they were `` friend to papandreous '' http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/economy/article/panagiotis-roumeliotis-to-head-hellenic-stability-fund https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenic_financial_stability_fund, 
  '' ... there 's a killer on the road ... '' appropriate soundtrack there . 
  interactions between what ? 
  if you think of a correlation between : * `` whats your opinion on the european union '' and * `` what 's your opinion about refugees ? '', 
  then : no - the variables are too many to truly correlate those questions . 
  on refugees alone : a ton of ... but mostly country-based . 
  that actually is correct : * in february 2015 , the new , syriza-led administration negotiated with the troika over a six-month extension of the master financial assistance facility agreement . 
  the administration proposed repurposing the remaining funds for keynesian anti-cyclical investments in the non-banking economic sector . 
  the eurogroup however insisted that the remaining buffer `` can only be used for bank recapitalisation and resolution costs . 
  on the one hand the hfsf seems like a very odd `` best buddies '' club if you go through it 's history : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenic_financial_stability_fund on the other hand - 18k/month for practically a banking cxo is n't that bad . 
  i would guess that the ceo of alpha bank gets more ... so it 's all about perspective, 
  just for reference : * the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( icty ) , set up in 1993 based on the un security council resolution 827 , [ 211 ] indicted gotovina , \u010cermak and marka\u010d for war crimes , specifically for their roles in operation storm , citing their participation in a joint criminal enterprise ( jce ) aimed at the permanent removal of serbs from the arsk-held part of croatia . 
  the icty charges specified that other participants in the jce were tu\u0111man , \u0160u\u0161ak , and bobetko and \u010cervenko , [ 212 ] however all except bobetko were dead before the first relevant icty indictment was issued in 2001 . 
  [ 213 ] bobetko was indicted by the icty , but died a year later , before he could be extradited for trial at the icty . 
  [ 214 ] the trial of gotovina et al began in 2008 , [ 215 ] leading to the convictions of gotovina and marka\u010d and the acquittal of \u010cermak three years later . 
  [ 216 ] gotovina and marka\u010d were acquitted on appeal in november 2012 , [ 217 ] in a ruling that exonerated the two generals as well as croatia 's political leaders of the 1990s , as the icty no longer considered operation storm to have been aimed at ethnic persecution . 
  [ 218 ] in february 2015 , the international court of justice ( icj ) dismissed a serbian lawsuit claiming that operation storm constituted genocide , ruling that croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country 's serb minority , though it reaffirmed that serious crimes against serb civilians had taken place . 
  [ 219 ] the number of civilian casualties in operation storm is disputed . 
  the state attorney 's office of the republic of croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed -- 156 in 24 instances of war crimes and another 47 as victims of murder -- during the battle and in its immediate aftermath . 
  the croatian helsinki committee disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period , [ 220 ] however their report was rejected by the icty , when submitted as evidence , due to unsourced statements and double entries contained in the report . 
  [ 221 ] serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing . 
  [ 222 ] icty prosecutors set the number of civilian deaths at 324 . 
  [ 223 ] although it was very difficult to determine the number of properties destroyed during and after operation storm since a large number of houses sustained some degree of damage since the beginning of the war , [ 202 ] human rights watch estimated that more than 5,000 houses were destroyed in the area during and after the battle . 
  [ 224 ] out of the 122 serbian orthodox churches in the area , one was destroyed and 17 were damaged , but most of the damage to the churches occurred prior to the serb retreat . 
  [ 225 ] as of november 2012 , croatian authorities have received 6,390 reports of crimes committed in the area during or after operation storm and have convicted 2,380 persons for looting , arson , murders , war crimes and other illegal acts . 
  as of the same date , 24 more trials of war crimes related to operation storm were in progress . 
  [ 226 ] in 2012 , serbian authorities were investigating five cases of war crimes committed during operation storm . 
  [ 227 ] the military operation also allowed croatian authorities access to areas where , as of march 2012 , a total of 144 mass and 1,200 individual graves have been discovered , in which a total of 3,809 croatian civilians and military personnel were buried . 
  ... you 're right ... 
  on the other hand i did n't trust him before ~ ~ stargate ~ ~ ( stupid me ) , after taxi and before 5th element ... he keeps suprising, 
  he also has to consider an offer his own electroate would accept ... and he is in no way the troika , the 18 eu-countries and the ecb in one person ... 
  ... only that the french view in no way does contradict these ideas , because they are pretty much alligned about the idea of `` stronger europe '' ... 
  does he get money for all this bullshit ? 
  could he please just stop talking in public ? 
  this is embarassing ... on a side not i just repeat sapin quote : * this will , which is also my own , implies to a stronger eurozone *, 
  single it-consultant = almost no costs compnay = a lot of costs it just does not scale easily . 
  too much hassle - i 'm visiting once a month . 
  not sure . 
  but the ela goes to the national bank , who funnels them on to the banks . 
  so whatever security there is goes the same way , opposite direction . 
  when ecb calls in the security they basically own the banks either way . 
  the producer of riot gear for greek police is a german manufacturer :p this is true at least for the helmets ( www.schuberth.com ), 
  in my understanding the banks are already owned by the ecb - the securities for ela seem almost exclusively bank stocks . 
  as a freelancer : long-term project 450km away from home , while home is 280 more km away from fiance . 
  neither home , nor project a sustainable thing . 
  fiance looking into a job in yet another place . 
  i 'm stuck with 2 appartments on rent , fiance with one on rent , looking for a second . 
  seems we end up having 4 homes for 2 single persons , at least for a time . 
  on the plus-side : money is not a problem ... 
  http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 http://www.euronews.com/, 
  the easiest scenario for euro disaster is italy disaster ... so i would n't say it 's impossible . 
  he already discussed that fact : https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/3ddnn9/travel_being_black_in_poland/, 
  he 's a young male black canadian - from his post history, 
  and oslo , and bratsilava , and amsterdam , and talinn , and vienna , and porto ... 
  you went to noma ? 
  months ago, 
  at first obviously , because it was part of the baltic sea . 
  over time it will probably loose salt . 
  and he arrived in germany friday . 
  joining his son and wife , living in berlin . 
  they did evacuate the tomb : why did turkey invade syria to dig up the grave of suleyman shah ? 
  still a fan of daniel le rouge cohn-bendit, 
  they did and secured the site . 
  they would never give up a squaremeter of territory . 
  thats why i posted it . 
  they get ( will get ) minimum wage in germany . 
  cant see the problem ? 
  thats why its called esl milk as in `` extended shelf live '' ... 
  so it can sit there 15 days, 
  what do i miss here ? 
  to stabilize your currency you normally buy it and sell foreign currency , right ? 
  so they devalued the rubel deliberately ? 
  why ? 
  read about the tomb of suleyman shah in syria for some perspective . 
  it remains turkish territory : ** the tomb of suleyman shah ( turkish : s\u00fcleyman \u015eah t\u00fcrbesi ) is a series of sites ( all geographically situated in aleppo governorate , syria ) , which housed the relics of suleyman shah , grandfather of osman i , the founder of the ottoman empire . 
  suleyman shah is believed to have drowned in the euphrates river in modern-day syria and an ottoman tomb in or near qal ` at ja ` bar has been associated with him . 
  under the treaty of lausanne this tomb site remained the property of turkey after the break-up of the ottoman empire . 
  ** https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomb_of_suleyman_shah, 
  germans ? 
  english ? 
  dutch ? 
  translation is totally acceptable and transports the message 100 % ... as a german i would mark this as efficent .
