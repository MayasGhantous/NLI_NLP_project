  ... though it leaves unpleasant images in my head ... 
  it 's politics - you need to have some success stories . 
  group . 
  toyota is group too . 
  well the 30mm broomstick is pre-installed . 
  so at least somethings ready too shoot ( do n't know about the `` intelligent '' ammunition though ), 
  www.bp.com would probably disagree, 
  taxes ? 
  or tax + insurance ? 
  / r/germany has a vast introduction in studying in germany on the sidebar . 
  was that a fart at the end ? 
  the phantom 3 is quite tempting . 
  1.400 $ for a drone though . 
  sometimes it takes two tries https://youtu.be/nnr0a4tmxea, 
  i know . 
  so serious . 
  steinbr\u00fcck ( merkel competitor ) said after italian election they voted for 2 clowns ( berlusconi the other ), 
  well ... a clown to entertain the interlude of crisis ... let 's applaud and move on . 
  he 's building cities ... not homes for lunatics . 
  i doubt anyone would ask him . 
  but just for you : here are some pictures of him with adolf ... as a toddler : http://home.earthlink.net/~earthmath17/top_children.htm, 
  +1 if i could vote there . 
  i dont like munich , hate dus , nur is a fucking bus station , ham too . 
  leipzig is nice , sch\u00f6nefeld are barracks , frankfurt is just down to basics . 
  if you know it actually runs at 300 % capacity it works quite well . 
  compared to eg munich you probably take half the time from arriving to boarding . 
  you finally get rid of that airstrip crossed by the main street ? 
  and tegel still works like a charm . 
  he built several parts of shanghai . 
  so its pretty much a flat function relating attacks to asylum seekers , because there have been more in 1st half 2015 than in 2014 . 
  well . 
  its actually an empty shell . 
  whereas linderhof is the finished deluded lsdtripped phantasy of a madman . 
  the next one coming around saying `` moral hazard is a myth '' will be pointed here . 
  yeah no food culture no gis ;-), 
  you realized the `` for now '' ? 
  you need some success stories from greece . 
  im pretty sure they work much harder on some issues now that the alternative is obvious . 
  we will see . 
  if all goes ok they will find a way 1-2yrs down the road . 
  it is inevitable but just not `` sellable '' right now . 
  steinmeier surely called him ahead of the signature . 
  but austria is basically a miniature germany , while italy is a hulk-sized greece ... 
  trust ... and the inability to sell real debt reliefs to their own electorate . 
  i mean if merkel would have stepped into parliament : `` they need 80 bn , and 40 will be a present '' you sure as hell could have seen her last day as chancellor . 
  anyway someone should have sued this ugly smurf years ago . 
  franconia, 
  ok . . that had to be explained . 
  the point is you can forget about growth without having the framework of a modern state . 
  its egg vs. hen . 
  the economy is already down to rock bottom . 
  and that is mostly the fault of syrizas politics the last months . 
  the debt relief is a topic in probably 1-2yrs . 
  you speak portugese ? 
  lets do a merger of france and germany . 
  full merger . 
  rest will follow . 
  yeah lets just not bother ... 
  what a fucking lazy bastard i am ... 
  thx ... my french is rusty, 
  burning cars was a thing in berlin : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/26/berlin-torched-cars-elections and the ecb-opening was n't all that smooth : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4tyu6xqoug, 
  why italy and not austria ? 
  ruined in 5 months ... 
  opium for everyone ? 
  not to repay the debts ... that 's why you can kill them somewhere down the road ( the debts that is ) . 
  reforms ... check the list of demands from last week . 
  there are issues open since 2012 ... independent statistics bureau , cadastre , ... 
  i mean you still have a german queen . 
  just saw a picture of her yesterday behaving german ... 
  soooo ... did they get convicted ? 
  law suit ? 
  or should the german gouvernement pay the bill for an independent company ? 
  i mean just go ahead and crush them . 
  for all i care they have to get an enourmous fine . 
  their asshole ex-ceo , ex-cdu politician should be fined since years . 
  thats because eg switzerland offered a flat tax to greece for foreign accounts . 
  varoufakis didnt even bother ... 
  you missed some steps : '' greece does not make enough money as long as they do not put up reforms '', 
  germany pays negative interest rates on 2yr . 
  loans . 
  greece pays 1.5 % for esm , 3 % for imf . 
  soon ex-yugoslavia will be declared `` safe havens '' . 
  that will end the influx . 
  btw roughly 98 % from there are denied asylum . 
  hope for prosperity ... its a basic human concept . 
  denying them in hindsight of much more desperate ppl . 
  is also . 
  to be fair : eg germany has also far better interest rates then the esm . 
  its a plus deal for us ... for now . . 
  yes but that wo n't work , if both parties have fundamentaly different visions/views of the future . 
  anyone not thinking '' hulk ? 
  huh ? 
  new avengers setting in russia ? '', 
  same day . 
  sure ... you also have a statistics office ... kind of ... 60 % still not registered . 
  just putting up a sign does not create a working infrastructure : http://www.gim-international.com/content/article/completing-the-greek-cadastre, 
  no you dont : http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/reforming-greece-easier-said-done-never-ending-case-land-registry/, 
  google took it down . 
  thats why one condition for money is a independent statistics office . 
  to be fair noone trusts any statistics from greece ... rightfully so .
