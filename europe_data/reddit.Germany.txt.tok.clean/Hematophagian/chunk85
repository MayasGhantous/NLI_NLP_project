  i mean that 's actually close to zero new debt ... why do n't they say that ? 
  did you read something different ? 
  does n't say that . 
  besides different conditions for eg the fins would not work for the others ... 
  making the euro the new drachmae ... well why not ;-), 
  could someone please eli5 the difference between net/gross debt in this 3rd bailout ? 
  how much is really `` new '' debt and how much of these 7xbn is just replacement/rollover of older , existing ecb/imf debts ? 
  but it 's pegged . 
  not enough ... at least 2baltics against i guess . 
  where are the dutch ? 
  thats her : https://youtu.be/wl_wxu6x1hu, 
  well shell used to have a 5000ppl standing army in nigeria ... i would call that despicable . 
  for ppl . 
  wondering : going 250 km/h stress you out beyond believe . 
  you just wont do it more then 20minutes , even if you could . 
  carrot on a stick version ? 
  upgrade , expand troops . 
  retreat troops ... 
  thats what i use for 50mbit as name from now on . 
  the saying goes , she does things right , but she does not do the right things ... 
  i bet one call from obama will put them in line . 
  source ? 
  i think she would be the worst european politician imageable and i doubt she wants that . 
  i really would like to see the poll with an `` germany fault '' option . 
  sure everyone could go along with that . 
  yes . 
  thats pretty much up to definition . 
  nontheless germany introduced official border control at austria border for g8 summit . 
  border controls are behind/before border . 
  german police boards the eurocity from verona in kufstein , cross the border to germany and do passport-controls . 
  they get up to 100 refugees/train . 
  not working . 
  state financing is forbidden . 
  besides that would be completely uncontrollable . 
  businesses will use banks , wages will be on accounts , payments for loans will be made . 
  ela will be increased . 
  the banks are practically owned by ecb at this time . 
  see . 
  now we 're getting closer . 
  some points are absolutely correct . 
  the inability of merkel to lead by vision/example is her foremost weakness . 
  she always reacts . 
  some things on the other side are just not up to her . 
  the ecb can only loan money to countries that are part of a program , because the euro is not a fiscal union and bailing out countries is not possible . 
  you might argue `` yeah because of the germans '' and this is somewhat true , but if the bailout clause would have been there before , the euro would not have survived 2008 . 
  and it 's also true that 18 countries signed this . 
  you might also argue that there are `` ways '' , but that would trigger uncertainty on markets , moral hazard and followers in south europe . 
  none of these facts are in any way influenced by merkel . 
  and then there is the syriza show . 
  trust has been destroyed , hateful things been said . 
  and the german electorate listens . 
  yeah the media played it 's role . 
  but the `` terrorist '' remarks did leave it 's stain on not only germans . 
  so what now ? 
  what merkel is really really good at is slowly make things acceptable . 
  sign the treaty for esm . 
  help will follow . 
  success will follow . 
  esm will rollover more and more imf/ecb bonds and then it will be 2050 payback ... and then some of it will vanish . 
  let 's turn it around . 
  give me a wishlist of what you would expect from specifically germany . 
  there is obviously a ( though subtle/small ) german stimulus engrained in the euro ... to deny that would be naive . 
  noone will take over debts . 
  for one this is n't even feasible , but more so not `` sellable '' to the electorate . 
  pasok and newd will sign anything . 
  eichmann is famous for this . 
  and he went to jerusalem . 
  hey ... yours is part of that game . 
  sure thats possible ... but noone wants that for very good reasons . 
  although it also wont be possible intime . 
  shhh ... go on buy more leopards and subs, 
  even with no debt , pumping more money into an unsustainable system wo n't heal the system . 
  reforms will heal it . 
  some may cost money , most will cost the will to do it . 
  this really is a stupid comparison . 
  the `` no bail-out '' and `` no eurobonds '' are following a `` no taxation without representation '' principle . 
  as soon as the recipient can be held accountable ( greek politican -  european parliament , voted for by ( also ) german voters ) it would/will work this way . 
  denied greece could get one, 
  choose your style of haircut everyone !,

  again you do confuse all . 
  first reform , then restructure , maybe very much later relief . 
  let me try : `` he 's drowning , someone has to drain the sea so he can use his feet , but that would probably cause a flood to drown others '',

  which haircut ist it ?

  you can say what you want about the `` ruling '' elites ( juncker , merkel , hollande , etc. ), 
  but they stick to the things till the end . 
  are you refering to the tax , or the spy scandal . 
  because one is moraly bad , but not unusual , the other is just national . 
  well bnp paribas had the highest exposure to greek debt pre-2010 . 
  so yes ... there are good reasons to work on that . 
  really ? 
  several dozens ?? 
  really sounds crazy . 
  that is 0.0000342 % of all syrian refugees in turkey . 
  if all else fails ... blame '' ... '', 
  that is absolutely correct . 
  a supplier does not make money by selling to lidl . 
  he has either `` economy of scale '' , or a `` reference customer '' .
