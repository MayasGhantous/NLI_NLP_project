  i mean an `` expiration deadline '' is a defined point in time . 
  not negotiable , not a vague reference , not a `` maybe '' , not a time `` frame '' . 
  how hard is this to understand ? 
  there is no `` ok - i 'll be there ... probably some time later '' . 
  whatever moral judgement one might have towards `` the market '' but in the end its an unbiasaed judgement . 
  markets blinked ... but didnt care too much . 
  translation ? 
  i like the joke '' dont pick up things , one might come along and slide a creditcard through your butt '', 
  only now its the esm , not the esfs . 
  and without imf ? 
  doubtful . 
  well ... the saying goes : `` if everything else fails ... blame the germans '' . 
  has worked so far for a lot of ppl . 
  on the other side : yes , what he said was obvious . 
  if someone would now propose to give a 3rd bailout , with basically no rules and tried to bring it into bundestag ... that would be his end . 
  the ecb ca n't and wo n't . 
  either way the ela is cut , and banks go bankcrupt 30minutes after reopening . 
  even without ela cut ( which would be illegal ) its 2days till bust . 
  so i would figure its 100 % default no matter what vote . 
  i thought its end of business imf, 
  day is pretty much made ... 
  its 0:17 wednesday morning . 
  greece has actually defaulted 2hrs ago ... 
  noone will agree to 3rd bailout . 
  especially not countries that have to go through parliament . 
  isnt sochi flooded right now ? 
  but but military !!, 
  +89 bn ela , at 20 % share, 
  no ela = no banks = no rolling over . 
  ripe of cheats that deal . 
  maybe he finds paper with pictures & numbers printed on it ... but thats about it . 
  defaulting usa really would mean stone age for everyone . 
  https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/status/615901306033729537 pretty much sums it up for germany . 
  jailtime ? 
  not even on your cakeday buddy, 
  45 $ or something, 
  he 's either the most reckless head of state or the most clueless ... neither one is any good in days like these ... 
  when this one drops below 300 $ / day i might consider : http://www.travelbook.de/reiseziele/imerovigli-631/hotels/grace-santorini-hotel-1088707.html, 
  even easier : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ev6_the_rivers_route, 
  dropped out of time ... last german one was otto i ; till 1862 . 
  even better - sneaky way to bring danes to euro ;-), 
  was n't the last monarch a german ? 
  ballsy move there . 
  travel along rivers : danube ( donau ) then rhine through germany . 
  perfect biking infrastructure . 
  well tourists actually bring in currency , so why not ? 
  germany has roughly 80bn . 
  add the ela to that and we come out at 100bn . 
  clearing bank was taken out of the system . 
  so no processing of credit cards . 
  draghi pretty much hates merkel and vice versa . 
  why should either one of them even suggest something to ecb . 
  and draghi would actually be obliged to cut ela tomorrow . 
  hes already out of legal bounds afterwards . 
  jesus what an amateur . 
  but they are part of usa . 
  and america stopped letting states go bankcrupt some 80yrs ago . 
  the `` debt relief = no more money '' is probably a myth . 
  even at lets say 50bn debt noone would lend money below 20 % interests ... which would amount to staggering new debt along the road . 
  and i cant see how a surplus could be maintained ... 
  didnt know . 
  even more embarrassing . 
  finmin that can be blackmailed ... 
  also right ... but 25 % seems very optimistic . 
  last haircut was 50 % . 
  next one ( default or not ) has to be higher . 
  it was sunday ... and he said `` the very concept of capital control is foreign to and opposed by this gouvernement '', 
  ... you 're right-so basically toilet paper ... 
  german court told them it 's 250.000 $ for every uber-tour ... they stopped . 
  they wo n't - but it does n't make any difference . 
  there was a rumour the cash left was roughly 160mio ( !! ) . 
  they deplete about 1bn/day . 
  as soon as they open they crash - they have money for probably 30minutes ( or they wo n't probably open ever again ... ) . 
  question that remains the ela should still be backed with security ... just sub-prime ones . 
  i wonder what they gave to ecb for ela ... greek bank stock ? 
  because germany would loose over 100bn euros ... one way or the other . 
  do you think this really surprised tsirpas/varoufakis ? 
  if so that would really be a new level of incompetence . 
  the fact that varoufakis denied capital controls on sunday morning while ordering them sunday evening made me wonder ... 
  ecb wo n't extend the lifeline elas without an agreed upon treaty . 
  ( it actually is prohibited to do so . 
  it actually should cut all ela on tuesday ... everything else is already out of their legal zone ) . 
  --  banks crash on 8th . 
  negotiations wo n't happen . 
  it 's probably take it or leave it ( while the take-it option is n't on the table anymore to be precise ) . 
  --  even the `` yes '' would probably lead to default . 
  actually i do n't see much options left . 
  defaulting on euro-basis just does n't seem to work . 
  and stil no way to devalue . 
  as it seems ( and will happen ) the greek people don ` t need their banks anymore ... you might probably see the problem of `` failing banks '' the upcoming week first-hand . 
  4 european leaders have expressed that no = euro-exit . 
  i guess that should be obvious by now . 
  as everyone expects 2 , while at 1 ... it 'll drop immediately . 
  merkel 's pride is close to zero . 
  she could go either way to rationaly follown the way that keeps her in office . 
  btw : although strauss-kahn said something of a debt relief the other day : think what would have happened if the biggest ego ( probably next to donald trump ) would have been head of imf ... 
  dax is also a performance-index not only the sum of it 's companies . 
  makes it a little more volatile by design . 
  illegal for persons ... but for states ? 
  what should they do ?
