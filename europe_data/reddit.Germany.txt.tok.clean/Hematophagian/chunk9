  maybe even `` mind crimes '' ? 
  is this orwell country ? 
  why not killing you for future mind crimes ? 
  are you to decide ? 
  do you know exactly that he would pull the detonator ? 
  in this little moment of silence in his head ? 
  filled with rage ? 
  a confused kid ? 
  after he actually has to get some kilograms of explosives ? 
  this kid is a threat - no second thought about that . 
  but we ( as is my understanding of europe ) do just not go out there and kill kids - we arrest them , put them through care and if necessary jail them . 
  now shut up or grab a gun and kill him yourself - please do not make others do it , and do n't do it in my name ... and definitley do not act suprised if you are not welcomed as a hero afterwards and go to jail as a murderer - because that exactly is what you are proposing . 
  not even china kills 14yr olds ... 
  you want throw a bomb on a kid that you never even met in self-defence ? 
  to what ? 
  a 14 yr old confused boy ? 
  arrest him ? 
  progress means not to kill ppl . 
  without a trial ... end of argument . 
  just read a paper that stated `` bulgarian organized crime rules red-light district in several german cities '' ... 
  i just leave this one here : http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/36013, 
  so iq = genetics ? 
  this sir is your approval f\u00fcor your registration to the national socialist party - congratulations . 
  which is based on what source exactly other then your imagination ? 
  you know what really would be stereotype-asnwer and at the same time not even false ? 
  you can steal stuff , where stuff is - the eastern european thugs do their crimes in germany . 
  you can call that `` immigrating crime '' - but it is of a very different kind than your thought process implied ... 
  it comes to the point , when we all should question ourselves , how far we are willing to go and at what point we simply abolish a lot of `` progress '' europe has fought over , shed blood for and accepted as basic rules - tru under all circumstances . 
  to be honest : `` bomb the shit out of a 14-year old '' is in none of these `` new worlds '' acceptable behaviour - at least to me . 
  2 thoughts : - your question came across as very `` uneducated '' to be honest - almost typical `` murica-style '' , though you do seem to come from asia , as far as i can see . 
  - i do n't think you understand the `` sexist thought process '' . 
  and it is definitley not `` obvious '' . 
  just by thinking a women is `` weak '' ( which she actually is by all physical means ) you are not sexist . 
  it 's actually more of the opposite , because you put her value higher then your own ( as a man ) . 
  `` invented '' on board of an english ship 1845 : * birkenhead drill the sinking of the birkenhead is the earliest maritime disaster evacuation during which the concept of `` women and children first '' is known to have been applied . 
  `` women and children first '' subsequently became standard procedure in relation to the evacuation of sinking ships , both in fiction and in real life . 
  the synonymous `` birkenhead drill '' became an exemplar of courageous behaviour in hopeless circumstances , and appeared in rudyard kipling 's 1893 tribute to the royal marines , `` soldier an ' sailor too '' * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_birkenhead_ ( 1845 ), 
  while i agree it should be closed you are both : * too lazy to read what i linked , where officials stated that without rammstein there would be no drones in asia nor africa * too dumb to understand that satellite links do n't do `` curves '' and ca n't go around half the globe . 
  incl . 
  the latency would make piloting impossible . 
  be warned : sorokin writes by far the weirdest novels i ever read . 
  the pilot center has a landline to rammstein , which has the satellite link to the drone : https://theintercept.com/2015/04/17/ramstein/ because you know : earth is round and stuff ... 
  relay is by landline ... to rammstein , then by satellite . 
  thats the whole point . 
   maybe interpret them a bit differently a hell of a lot differently ;-), 
   no idea why we are still in europe i give you the example of rammstein , largest military base in europe . 
  it is the central surveillance , european command hub , and drone relay station of the us military . 
  no rammstein , no projection of power , no need for 10 aircraft carriers and drones , no influence on china , etc. 
  it 's btw the third time : * $ 183,000 ( 1987 ) * $ 6,000 ( 1999 ) * $ 30,000 ( 2016 ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laws_against_holocaust_denial denial of all genocides is illegal in france . 
  this includes the armenian genocide by turkey . 
   pax americana you basically pay for influence ... you need to choose though . 
  russia cant afford to have another conflict they need to intervene . 
  too expensive . 
  so baltic would be enough ? 
  what about connecting kaliningrad ? 
  nah that was the austrian duke shot by a serbian :p, 
  not necessarily . 
  they could influence the terms for european asylum according to their will . 
  if the eu as a whole has eg polands criteria for asylum , there is not much left to refuse . 
  then all refusal would be outright abolishing asylum . 
  that answers a lot of my questions - perfect link , thx !, 
   oprichnina read this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/day_of_the_oprichnik, 
   we 're as bad as the eu no - worse :p, 
  the founder was swiss-german . 
  his original name was actually heinrich nestle . 
  nestle is btw . 
  a very swabian name , meaning `` small nest '' - the `` le '' is the swabian dialect for '' - lein '' making it a small one . 
  i will have resigned in a moment , though others resigning too without consequences , therefore i will stay unresigned eternally - in another dimension ? 
  all the luck to you guys !, 
  so it was just 2 days to run through all stages . 
  yeah get staigth down to the point . 
  the zdf is a public broadcaster and although the influence from parties is counter-balanced to some extent there is no need to `` order '' them to do something ( which would be totally unacceptable ) . 
  but they would censor themself before . 
  at least in cases like this , when the content is obviously illegal . 
  that exactly was also the point b\u00f6hmermann wanted to prove . 
  she did n't . 
  the broadcaster already had done it . 
  slander is . 
  it is probably too in finland, 
   iirc the main reason was public opinion . 
  tschernobyl had a huge impact on germans and even before that , protests could amass up to 200k people demonstrating - not any other issue could activate this many people . 
  the green party more or less originated from that . 
  fukushima was then the tipping point to more or less `` race '' out of nuclear . 
  btw : i already did post it yesterday : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dbkt4/merkel_says_zdfs_poem_on_president_erdo%c4%9fan/d1pn0y7, 
  for the sake of the argument : for the interested , i 'll post the poem . 
  actually he was quite clever , but still overstepped the mark . 
  he discussed `` what are actually the boundaries of satire ? '', 
  translation : retard , coward and uptight , is erdogan the president his dick stinks worse than a d\u00f6ner , even a pigs fart smells better he 's the man hitting girls , while wearing latex masks his favourite is fucking goats and supress minorities kicking kurds , hittings christians , while watching child porn . 
  and even in the evening it 's fellatio with 100 sheeps yes , erdogan is truly a president with a small dick you can hear every turk singing he has shriveld nuts ( = schrumpelkl\u00f6ten for the interested ) from ankara to istanbul , every one knows he 's a faggott perverted , full of lice and zoophil ( = beasteality ) , recep [ fritzl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_fritzl ) [ priklopil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfgang_p%c5%99iklopil ) his head is empty as are his balls , a star on every gangbang . 
  til his cock burns while pissing , that 's recep erdogan the president . 
  it is illegal . 
  he acknowledged it before reading it . 
  merkel just stated that fact . 
  did you read it ? 
   eu thinks of democracy in the region i would assume that in this kind of tribal society , a democracy is not a working concept . 
   this association treaty is actually damaging in a lot of ways and will not benefit us how so ? 
  i have to admit - i just read up a little bit , because for germany this is such a non-issue in public . 
  my understanding is most of these territories just didnt bother to go independent . 
  as soon as the uk bullies them , they are out .
