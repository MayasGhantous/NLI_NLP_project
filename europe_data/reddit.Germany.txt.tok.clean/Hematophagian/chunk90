  have a look on the top/flop list : http://www.fondsweb.de/etf-topflops, 
  besides the joke . 
  i actually put some resaerch into it . 
  but whenever russias tail twists a little the investments tumble ... 
  question remains ... when you are in france you can cross the border to germany on a bycycle without even realizing you switched countries ... so why the effort to go to the uk ? 
  very much depends . 
  im also a friend of etf . 
  i did invest in long-term-topics . 
  so i bought ( + / - roughly 1 year ) * a water-related etf ( +22 % ) * india-related ( +16 % ) * oil-industry-related ( +2 % ) * brent-oil ( -3 % ) * healthcare 3rd world ( +1 % ) * luxury goods ( +6 % ) * future tech ( +10 % ) * infrastructure eu/us ( -3 % ) * robot tec ( +18 % ... most of it through $ / $ win ) * eco energy ( +2 % ) * china ( +4 % ) there are thousands of indicies out there they can track - so you 'll probably find anything of interest . 
  ok . she lost hannover with her grandma ( victoria ) . 
  that 's actually a wonderful eli5 explanation , one even / u/savannajeff would be proud of . 
  according to pirates : probably somalia . 
  porn starts at the angle the jimmy rises ... 
  a lot of comapnies could get rid of a lot of regulations that come with th eu . 
  banking regulations , workers right regulations , environmental ( though that would last even if there 's just free trade uk/eu ) , etc. 
  and lobbying in london is surely easier then lobbying in brussels ... to 28 countries . 
  in case of greece i think we all could do with a shortening of the process ... whatever outcome . 
  nah replaced by daniel craig, 
  looks more like `` fuck life '' . 
  i dont know . 
  wouldnt any nuclear superpower aim its missiles for countries of the supposing block ? 
  what do you think where chinese and us missiles point to ? 
  or israeli ? 
  its like we all sit in a bassin of petrol and threaten each other with a match . 
  doesnt matter much who would die first and who second ... 
  if 36 % secures you the job ... the election system seems flawed . 
  it might be partially for punishing the left ... but thats a minor agenda . 
  seperating gouvernment from nation is not an argument that flies ... anywhere besides dictatorships ... and especially not for a country that uni sono told anyone `` respect our democratic election results '' . 
  and about leaving ... greece could do that in probably 2 weeks ... much faster then the uk ... and no i would n't want it . 
  well ... you voted for him . 
  he said he will fight the good fight ... and will win it . 
  seems he lost it . 
  ps : not that i think any other party available in greece would have been a better solution ... but after all the saying goes that you get the leader you deserve ... 
  i 'm a freelancer ... my monthly wage is between 0 and 22.000 $ / month ... i 've seen the best and worst of times ... 
  well it 's obviously that they ( the three ) now know/think they can push it all down his throat . 
  he will break either way . 
  if he accepts he gets tared & feathered in athens , if not he will probably get the same treatment ... and the fault . 
  most important is probably to get a solution that lasts ... even based on drachma . 
  not blaming the average one ... blaming the exggerated one . 
  oce still pays more salaries then having revenue ... 
  as long as eg the railway still pays more in salaries then they do actually have revenue ... there might be some `` wiggle room '', 
  yeah but he 's a phd in germany . 
  i would have guessed he 's at probably 3.500 . 
  just started , or shitty job ? 
  the myth tends to feel very nasty in hamburg when coming from munich ( which i do 20 times/year ), 
  as a part , not as a `` go for all '' - solution . 
  vat has a broader base , is mostly `` unevadable '' and also reduces the complexity of the greek system . 
  it also seemed to cure some of the exaggerations , like having caviar with 6 % tax , or overboarding health care expenses . 
  taxing companies on the other side reduces economic growth . 
  also worse weather ... 
  just c & p my comment below : storyline : imf : `` cut pensions , or something else with same amount '' tsirpas said `` ok . no cut ; raise tax '' imf : `` no tax , but cuts '' tsirpas `` unfair !, 
  never before ! '', 
  imf : `` bad luck '', 
  you got the system wrong . 
  the ecb lends to national greek bank which then lends to regualr greek banks for securities ( that probably would not be worth a dime otherwise ) . 
  so the domino-effects goes backwards the same way : ecb cuts off greek national bank , national bank cuts off regular bank -  bank busts -  securities are probably 5 % worth of money . 
  ecb takes in deficit from greek national banks , either can resolve by own funds or shares deficit by share to owners ( all national banks ) . 
  obviously banks would bust also means greece would bust , greece leaves euro ( not definied how ) , national greek bank leaves ecb , all transfer money would probably kept in books ( again : target2 , the inter-country national banks balance sheet ) , but would probably never be balanced ever again . 
  ecb looses ela , and a lot of other things . 
  for reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/target2 but this is actually a difference , because target2-money is basically central bank money ... or as others might say : pure fantasy, 
  * waves goodbye *, 
  the cut was `` or other cuts '' proposal . 
  tsirpas said `` ok . no cut ; raise tax '' imf : `` no tax , but cuts '' tsirpas `` unfair !, 
  never before ! '', 
  imf : `` bad luck '', 
  translates into a loss in the inter-bank balance sheet ( search target2 ) and obviously in the national banks to ecb balance sheet . 
  so all other eurozone national banks have to cut it according to their share : so for germany it 's either 18 % cut of earnings , or it is refinanced by reserves from ecb from former earnings . 
  oh btw : 85bn are peanuts for the ecb, 
  see this very nicely presents the idea of a common europe : a europe of regions instead of nations . 
  i could n't name a dish that would represent all of germany ( besides stereotypes like kraut and sausages ) , but rather some food from the area i was born . 
  so from me it would be : [ schwarzw\u00e4lder kirschtorte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_forest_cake ), 
  birthday guy pays, 
  well to me the sentence `` do n't rise taxes , cut expenses '' seems quite reasonable . 
  at least it is a demand . 
  it 's probably too late anyway and so the final curtain falls . 
  nope - you got me wrong ... the tsirpas version was the `` maybe '' , while the imf version was the `` definitely '' . 
  look : https://twitter.com/dirkhoeren/status/613712353859907584/photo/1, 
  obviously all ... 
  stabilizing the euro and controlling inflation are their top-most priorities . 
  you could derive a whole lot of actions from that goal . 
  tbh after reading : it is a lot of `` might '' lead to 8bn `` maybe '' and `` later '' . 
  the intention was never to `` pay for each others debt '' . 
  explicitly excluded . 
  it 's all about the moral hazard that comes from `` helping '' . 
  that 's easy to answer : harsh reforms and a change of mind . 
  and afterwards a ton of money to rebuild . 
  btw : did n't the uk just mostly sell the train comapnies ? 
  not saying that this is a good solution - but surely no private railroad company pays these salaries ( let alone the fact that they run higher then the revenue ! ), 
  if you have some time read this : http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/10/greeks-bearing-bonds-201010 then please tell me how much still is true , and how much has changed . 
  as long as i even believe 10 % of what is described there is the daily life in greece they should immediately stop whining . 
  btw : they salaries of the oce ( greek railway company ) is still higher then it 's revenues ... 
  mep ... wake me when merkel orders a backbench cdu mdb to say the same as a test . 
  ~ ~ does n't fit into `` right of free movement '' - wo n't happen unless they leave ( ... hopefully ) ~ ~, 
  does n't even have gendered articles ... which language is actually easier then english ? 
  he will never be deported to egypt . 
  it 's unconstitutional to deport someone to a country where he might be killed . 
  isnt barcelona completely broke ? 
  i remember several cast members have been sacked because sexual practices in costume on set ... found it : http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2366611/the-teletubbies-unmasked-the-people-iconic-childrens-tv-characters.html, 
  because they cant roll over the debt and those tbills have a much higher interest rate . 
  that comparison is a disgrace .
