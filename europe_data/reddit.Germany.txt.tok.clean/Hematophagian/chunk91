  magdeburg may at least stay on level . 
  so does the us accept these cases ? 
  so its going down the drain because 3 little issues . 
  well he forgot about the rent cut thing though . 
  absolutely . 
  but any uneducated , jobless ex-refugees should leave . 
  if there ever would be a solution to syria ... 
  one of the differences is that elsalvador/guatemala/honduras send mostly economic refugees ... it should be easy to send them back . 
  but you just ca n't send syrians back to syria ... 
  i do fully expect the syrian refugees in germany to go back to syria , if there 's no need for them in germany ( as in having jobs ) . 
  is turkey an indistrialized country ? 
  ask for `` canesten '' http://www.canesten.de/, 
  what 's that source ? 
  * she has been ordered by her us masters during the g1 + `` 6 vassal states '' meeting last week to not let greece slip away ... because a greece not under the control of the eu is a greece free to grow and prosper under the brics , aiib and sco . 
  well germany-backed quota-system did not come far : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11615892/eu-migrant-quota-plan-in-tatters-after-france-and-spain-join-british-opposition.html, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laffer_curve it 's science ... 
  austria is probably on the forefront . 
  they tend to get more radical each day ... they should know better . 
  you are actually proposing at least 2nd degree murder . 
  which also violates a ton of international law . 
  to be fair : there are 1.7 mio refugees in turkey . 
  this is probably 8 times compared to the eu . 
  if i were them i would try to do the same . 
  first of all we all should wish that their home wouldnt be lifethreatening so they wouldnt have to move in the first place . 
  ah because thats where they wanted to go . 
  why germany ? 
  funny enough that merkel is probably the only one to have stood up and wants them to stay . 
  then why is there not a prosecution on romania-level going on ? 
  while im sympathic to all you wrote theres still one undeniable fact : in the beginning the money borrowed benefited the people and they feasted ... 
  not over here in south germany . 
  ok . 722ad is far strechted , but at what point does an invader become a native ? 
  hmm ... might be a difference between conquerers and natives ... 
  z\u00fcrich ... because london is just not expensive enough . 
  billions have been redistributed already . 
  because target2 is completely unbalanced and will cost billions either way . 
  its a precondition to have free movement of eucitizens when you want free movement of goods + services, 
  so ... why should one take it ? 
  i would prefer israel over spain tbh . 
  they have to pay . 
  they have to obey all rules ( incl . 
  free movement ) . 
  they dont have any influence . 
  ... really good deal ... 
  this would impy as a white european you ca n't be racist towards - let 's say jews ... there might be some contradicting evidences ... 
  ... thin varnish of civilization ... ( btw : who said that ? ), 
  not only a german friend ... a fully-fledged aryan ... now shut up lawrow and finally die of lung cancer ... 
  i do n't want to deny your reasoning all together - but the `` do n't finance those immigrants - gibs money to me not to scum '' is disgusting . 
  first : germany contributes 25bn to europe - and will continue to do so , and rightfully so ( no matter what we pay for refugees ) . 
  second : i canot see how germany is responsible for the credit crunch in romania - all i see is an austerity policy , that might be inspired by the eu , but the lei still has 1.75 % interest rate ... euro has 0.3 % ??? 
  so why the fuck is n't anyone dropping the rate since you are still fully responsible for your own currency . 
  third : whatever economic genius you ask will tell you `` germany needs to spend more money '' . 
  the ( scummy ) refugees cost 10bn/year estimated additional spending - right what everyone told us . 
  real income did go up in 2015 . 
  also on track . 
   so , if germany has a declining population and insufficient work-force it should have moved much more of its ' industry towards the south and east , caring for european citizens and allowing eu democracy to take hold . 
  but instead it chose to use the pretext of a refugee crisis to let in 1 million potential workers ( we 'll see if most of them can even get any qualification ) while greeks , spaniards , croatians and italians are jobless and romanians and bulgarians earn peanuts . 
  boy , this is a bullshit accusation if i ever read anyone ... besides there are really a lot of production sites in eastern europe - just check the production sites of audi , or porsche, 
  3 $ / day in germany - soon not to be paid cash anymore ... hardly that much of a pull factor . 
   il padrino probably more likely il divo : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1023490/, 
  / r/europe has become quite trigger-happy regarding insults ... since the nationalists and the gun-lovers and trump-supporters are flooding in . 
  nonetheless i liked your joke . 
  could n't hear * bungabunga * you . 
  usually it 's the cap-level for income tax . 
  so anyone in the highest bracket of a progressive income tax system . 
  did the banks `` lure '' the customers towards those deals ? 
  or was it pure `` greed '' ? 
  was any instituion challenged so far ? 
  what 's the preferred solution in italy ( besides the obvious fact that dublin2/3 is dead ) ? 
  i honestly would love another country to take the lead on that issue - the dutch proposal comes as a pleasent change . 
  italy of all countries ? 
  seems unwise . 
  nonetheless - this is also just a porposal - so probably they will throw some money in . 
  shitton of money ? 
  distribution works like a charme ... 
  according to some laws : yes . 
  nontheless its just a fact that they cant `` just go home '' . 
  not denying that narrative ( although it probably will not be really true before 2025 ) . 
  but what i 'm kind of fed up with is the `` they are just economic refugees - they can go home and fight/build up their country - which is in most cases just a blatant lie . 
  this does not mean that we can keep up the status quo and let most fo them inside ... still does not answer the question how to keep them out , besides just letting them drown . 
  * erithrea : unlimited conscription * central africa : basically failed state * mali : terrorists on the run * somalia : failed state * nigeria/sudan : terrorists on the run * all of them : water ressources diminishing ... not that i would n't support the idea of turning them away - but there are reasons to `` not just go back '', 
  there 's another place having such results : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_douaumont https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/douaumont_ossuary, 
  probably ... but it might diminish even futher - or at least much more people can be introduced to the `` zero value '' cluster of worlds population ... 
  likely ... if not now even more likely in 1-2decades ... with 60mio . 
  on the move and failing water ressources ... the value of a human will partially decrease to zero . 
  well for once it 's not only about austerity . 
  the installation of 4 hotspots have been funded by the eu - one is operational . 
  nonetheless - this `` guard the borders '' - yelling should include a `` let them drown '' - yelling if any of them would honest ... because that 's what will ultimately happen . 
  that 's the spirit - i want more `` stop the migration '' - redditors to come out and shout : `` kill em all '' , i mean what could go wrong ? 
  pot calling kettle black much ? 
  in germany they taxed `` alco-pops '' , topic was discussed in the us also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcopop, 
  http://qz.com/412130/frances-10-week-holidays-and-35-hour-work-weeks-are-under-attack/ http://services.completefrance.com/forums/completefrance-forums/cs/forums/1198367/printpost.aspx rtt-days is the name you #re looking for, 
  sure they work 40-45hrs / week ... and then going back to 3days/week in octobre - to balance their working hours on a yearly basis ... 
  a race to the bottom surely helps the lowest paid ... / s, 
  there is no majority for changing the constitution . 
  neither the parliament nor the electorate wants that . 
  the high court might help though doing some interpretation . 
  at the end it would again be pushing the problem downhill . 
  germany is surrounded by safe countries ... no need to take in anyone . 
  she cited polls ... its not like an outsider spoke some unwise words, 
  she said the majority of poland has this opinion,
