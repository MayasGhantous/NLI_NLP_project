what does antarctica need the euro for ? 
  ^ i 'll ^ see ^ myself ^ out ... 
  we 're talking about football stadiums in germany here . 
  in the 90s it was absolutely common for asshole fans to throw bananas at black players or to mock them with monkey sounds . 
  where `` gay '' was regularly used as an insult to players . 
  i am very glad that this kind of shit has vanished from many stadiums by now . 
  and you do n't seem to grasp that football in germany is way more than `` entertainment media '' to many fans . 
  you really can not compare it to the nfl/nba/mlb . 
  usually when people demand to `` keep politics out of the stadium '' it 's a backlash to fans being against racism and homophobia . 
  well , there also are actual monkeys called '' [ klammeraffe ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/klammeraffen ) , so if this is n't an it-themed bar i 'd wager that 's where they got the name from ... 
  russia acts like a 5 year old . 
  if you blindly accept friend requests without checking the profile it 's your own goddamn fault . 
  there are a lot of reasons to use a fake profile . 
  political dissidents in not-so-democratic countries come to mind . 
   `` the use of authentic names on facebook protects people 's privacy and safety by ensuring people know who they 're sharing and connecting with , '' the company said . 
  yeah . . how about letting the users decide how to protect their privacy ? 
  nah , we would 've been late , because when we landed in split my suitcase cracked open and all my underwear was spread out all over the conveyor belt : /, 
  that 's funny , because when i was on vacation in croatia back in 1998 , i was in makarskar !, 
  beautiful place , great people !, 
  i 'd also like to add that we were definitely there early , but that had nothing to do with us being german , but rather with the suicidal taxi driver who took us from split to makarska ( you know , that road just next to the cliffs , with a unnerving lack of guard rails ) . 
  he kinda made up for it by saying `` nein ! '', 
  in 2003 , though . . 
  yea , i realized that when everyone i ran into in the gaslight quarter was either a fellow neuroscientist or a marine . 
  now you 're just building strawmen . 
  how does society say `` you ca n't study '' ? 
  we have no tuition fees , there 's financial support for students who need it ( baf\u00f6g ) , and it 's always possible to work as a waiter or something . 
  that is in no way comparable to the state simply not allowing you to study because fuck you . 
  i know a whole lot of people who studied without support from their parents . 
  it 's definitely possible . 
  well , i would n't exclude that i posted that before , it 's just that [ this site ] ( https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0cciqfjaaahukewicxkp2tyxgahwpftskhczaafg&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fredditcommentsearch.com%2f&amp;ei=_fr4vylwgqmt7abmgypabq&amp;usg=afqjcnfl4_s1jim4dquvxegrbr6smoxuiw&amp;sig2=xr6lofmlnxbv8glpfnhufa ) does n't give me any results for the queries i mentioned . 
  also it 's quite possible someone else wrote the same thing - i was there * for a huge conference which was attended by several hundred germans . 
  * edit : in san diego , that is . 
  not sea world . 
   you need to fill out a fomular german bureaucracy confirmed . 
   but if you seek help after that well ... it is some shit about beeing a man that 's kind of what i was aiming at . 
  the idea that testosterone somehow makes you immune to mental problems is ridiculous and this mentality definitely needs to change , not only in the bundeswehr but in society as a whole . 
  actually i think * especially * the military should take these thing serious and this should be a topic openly discussed among soldiers of all ranks . 
  because you definitely do n't want the guy next to you to completely lose it when it counts ( `` dude , cover me ... dude ? 
  are you crying ? 
   people would like to have their simpler lives back that 's not a matter of the political system , but rather connected to the radical changes the world has undergone in the last decades . 
  i 'd say a lot of people from western germany would also like to go back to the eighties , because the world was so much simpler back then . 
  the world was clearly divided into the bad and the good , jobs were safe ... 
  yeah , but what if you knew that you 'd probably could study chemistry , because you 're quite intelligent and love chemistry , but ca n't because your parents were n't academics ? 
  not because you can not afford it , but because the state simply says `` you ca n't '' ? 
  huh ? 
  did i post that before ? 
  mind showing me ? 
  because searching my comments for `` orca '' , `` sea world '' , or `` troops '' did n't give me any results . 
  also , i do n't really care about karma . 
  i 'd also state that opinion in a military sub . 
  i never said our system is n't flawed . 
  but i 'll just say one more word : hohensch\u00f6nhausen . 
  well it 's obvious that simply joining the military is in no way as stigmatized in the us as it is here germany . 
  i think it 's seen as a more or less normal job , while in germany most people will think you 're either very right-leaning , a gun-nut , or too stupid to find any other line of work . 
  in part that 's the fault of the '68 movement and the * friedensbewegung * , because they generated a climate in which very few left-leaning young persons will join the military . 
  on the other hand it 's partly the bundeswehr 's fault , because they fail to cut with old traditions ( e.g. 
  naming garrisons and stuff after wwii officers ) and also fail to weed out the bad apples . 
  i think most german vets who return to civil life keep their experiences for themselves , because of the stigma . 
  on the other hand , in the us i had the feeling vets are unconditionally treated like heroes , even if they never were deployed . 
  a while ago i read a vet 's comment here on reddit saying `` stop offering me drinks . 
  yes , i was in iraq , but i only repaired trucks . 
  i 've never left the base , never fired a round in combat and did n't get shot at . '' . 
  interestingly , although they treat every vet like a hero , the military itself seems to treat their vets quite shitty in terms of psychological support with things like ptsd , but from what i 've learned the * bundeswehr * is n't any better in that regard . 
  but maybe / u/drachwill can give us some more perspective on that . 
  disclamer : i never served in the military . 
  something , something broom stick . 
  something , something overheated rifle . 
  something , something eurohawk . 
  something , something nh90 . 
  yeah , some middle ground would be desirable . 
  because what the americans do is kinda over the top . 
  when i was at sea world in san diego in 2010 , there was a fucking `` honor our troops '' video played before the orca show started . 
  when we flew to atlanta , it was announced that there were some marines on the plane and they were thanked for their service and everyone started clapping . 
  these guys were fresh out of boot camp and had n't set foot on foreign soil yet , still they were applauded like fucking heroes . 
  i also would not need a whole month of bundesliga matches dedicated to the military with the coaches donning some * flecktarn * sweaters . 
  yes , they do that in the nfl . 
  i despise most german 's negative attitude towards everything military , but we should n't make the us our role model . 
  but they always conveniently forget that the paid jpb was n't necessarily the one you pursued ( because iirc it was hard to get into university if your parents were mere workers ) , that their appartment probably was bugged by the stasi , and that their own products were so shitty that everyone tried to get their hands on western goods . 
  there is/was one in the centro oberhausen ten years ago . 
  no idea if it still exists . 
  given the insane number of people represented by ver.di , a lot of people in the public sector are allowed to strike . 
  i mean , it 's funny how you can see the thought process here : someone read that opinion piece ( it 's really more a blog article , i 've read it ) on the time website , thought this is totally relevant to a college in the uk and they started making a fuss . 
  now , i do n't know much about either gay or black culture in the uk , but something tells me that the use of african ** american ** vernacular english is not very prevalent at nus in the first place . 
  a subset of gay guys is accused of appropriating black female culture by using certain mannerisms and speech , e.g calling themselves `` gurl '' or `` strong black women '' . 
  but all i know about this comes from the internet . 
  who ... who bombed northern ireland in ww2 ? 
  i thought we did n't make it beyond london . 
  i think the question is who 's supposed to follow . 
  relevant user name . 
  historically , we had the cave and you the cars . 
  not true , powell 's infamous presentation described mobile facilities for the production of biological weapons . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_and_the_iraq_war#colin_powell.27s_presentation ) . 
  i just read that the `` europe '' is only still in the name because of tradition , and that saceur nowadays is actually the commander of all nato operations . 
  but my point still stands , what does matter is that he , by definition , is always an american , appointed by the us president . 
  i think in a multi-national alliance commander should not always be from the same country . 
  you know what would be great ? 
  if saceur actually was , you know , * from fucking europe * . 
  and why the hell is the supreme allied commander europe nominated by the us president ? 
   but the city officials tend to behave like snopish assholes who would have thought ... 
  did they have to lower the rent then ?
