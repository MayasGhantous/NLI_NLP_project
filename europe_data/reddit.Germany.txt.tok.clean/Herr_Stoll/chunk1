you cant force them to register . 
  they have to register themself and if they refuse they are trchnically completly illegal . 
  thats the first time i ever heard that as a german . 
  i do n't know from where you got that meaning for invasion but an armed force is not part of an invasion . 
  that word can have so many meanings . 
  sometimes it is n't just used as a military term as in `` the annual invasion of the resort by tourists '' . 
  rodents can invade a place and destroy crops etc. 
  i totally support tritonx with his meaning - this is an invasion . 
  not one with an armed force butthe sheer overwhelming number of people walking is enough to declare this an invasion . 
  i 'm scared . 
  this year more people than our fifth most populated city arrive and many want to stay . 
  where do they live ? 
  how can we possible offer them work to earn their own money ? 
  how can this country live when each year more and more arrive ? 
  call me a bigot or a nazi or whatever . 
  but i 'm scared about the future . 
  edit : just to clarify - i do n't say that we should n't take them and i feel sorry for everyone who has to leave his country because of war but ... how ? 
  how can we solve this problem ? 
  spd is just the same - but without a good candidate for the election .

  i 'll manually translate the text if anyone wishes . 
  yes !, 
  my signature has the power to stop this . 
  do you hear that , corporations ? 
  bow down to the might of my online signature . 
  online petitions are the worst thing ever to happen to political activism . 
  people belive that clicking on a shiny button has any revelance to the real world . 
  platforms for online petitions are creating a false sense of action . 
  people get lulled into thinking that they have done their part sucessfully and everything is fine . 
  no , it is n't . 
  fight against ttip ? 
  join real demonstrations on the street , inform yourself and talk to people . 
  explain how and why ttip is destroying our values . 
  * do something real !, 
  * edit : removed a certain name, 
  i 'm not saying that . 
  i agree that germany lacks a competent military but our leaders see that there is no external pressure to invest into the army . 
  australia and most european states are different for that reason . 
  i live in central europe and none of the neighboring countries are hostile . 
  australia has a power seeking china next to it . 
  it takes two to tango . 
  we are probably twins . 
  ooohhh ... 
  now i feel dumb . 
  who ? 
  the journalist ? 
  he did n't do anything wrong with asking questions . 
  if i understand correctly the car was not allowed to park there so the question is valid . 
  the journalist should n't have put his foot down at the door but that does n't allow them to hit him again and again . 
  as you can see in this thread : this topic is very unpopular . 
  now imagine how easy it is for politicians to play innocent if the eu demands this tax ... `` oh well , we would n't do this and we are very against it but we ca n't do anything against this eu law . 
  we have to tax you and we are soooo sorry !, 
  honestly , i feel bad !, 
  now , please , leave your tax ~ ~ dollars ~ ~ euros here with me . '', 
  the tweet is a tiny bit misleading . 
  the video/gif is older then a year and if i remeber correctly not connected to brexit . 
  the original was [ here ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tqrg7wh_fc0 ) but is no longer available . 
  nevertheless , what funny anti-eu propaganda have you found ? 
  edit : found [ something ] ( http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/this-edl-member-repeatedly-failing-to-set-fire-to-a-european-flag-can-teach-us-a-lot-about-ourselves-909 ) with a bit more context, 
  that romanian guy in the linked video . 
  how about no ? 
  we definitely tried to enforce that rule . 
  everyone on the balkan just waved them through to the north . 
  that 's true but we also do not deport someone easily . 
  it could take years , even decades , until the immigration offices decides if you have to leave . 
  and even then : you 'll properly have children who visit our schools , are somewhat integrated in our society and have absolute no roots to their parents home country . 
  that means that you have a pretty easy case with good reasons why you should be allowed to stay . 
  you would n't want do send this pool child away now , would you ? 
  you ca n't even voice your opinion with a cent - you need 2 for that !, 
  oh boy , what a treat to see this !, 
  thank you very much for considering my application . 
  i guess most people do n't know a bit about me as i 'm more a lurker and reader and so invite everyone to ask me anything . 
  is anyone using a two-round election in europe ? 
  i 'm now really tired and i think i 'll go to bed . 
  but so many states are now so close to being decided . 
  any tips for staying awake ? 
  trump still has a decent lead in many states . 
  now that 's something unexpected . 
  i know , i know . 
  but they honestly do a really great job with this coverage . 
  they are even a bit mad that their are n't invited into trumps party ( he banned all foreign media ) \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  that 's a very mature approach and i like that , thank you !, 
  i just joked a bit so no hard feelings . 
  i watched a bit cnn and they have a great guy at the map . 
  he describes the election on the county-level and points perfectly out that trumps wins in rural areas . 
  can i join you pretty please ? 
  i suggest watching rt. 
  they are really conservative with their count and include only final numbers . 
  definitly not the best choice but i 'm so annoyed with the huge discrepancies between news stations . 
  `` i want to be with you but not really '' . 
  sorry , i 'm just joking a bit . 
  you are like my ex . 
  we 're not over with you , england . 
   oh boy , 2016 is really a * special * year . 
  i honestly have to say that i like how rt counts ( 216 - 197 for trump after he got nc ) . 
  they only take definitive numbers and are rather conservatives . 
  if it is unclear who 's going to win they just leave it blank . 
  depending on trumps final stance on nato you might want to learn some russian . 
  i guess living in the same time zone helps a bit . 
  it 's fun to watch this election with fellow europeans and just be stunned about whats happening .
