  and do n't tell me it is all merkels fault . 
  because refugees were coming to europe before she made things worse by opening her stupid mouth and talking about no upper limits . 
  thanks pal :-), 
   ( `` the concentration camps are unfortunately currently inoperative '' fucking hell ) akif pirin\u00e7cis was actually saying , that the politicians in germany are acting as if they would like to put everybody , who is against the current refugee politics , into a concentration camp . 
   the only thing they can achieve is that they delay the whole thing until they are gone not necessarily . 
  poland and the baltic states are highly critical of this idea as well . 
  they do n't trust the eu to defent them and would rather like to see more nato troops and equipment in their region . 
  so my guess is , that the uk 's strategy is to get those countries to block the creation of an eu army by promising them more nato troops . 
  pacifism is nice and dandy , but wo n't work when you have to deal with the likes of is . 
  also i highly doubt that the proposed `` collective security system with participation of russia '' would actually be peacfull , given russias record of mitary involvement . 
   none of that is official party policy policy but opinions of single members no ? 
  then how comes that the linke made a proposal on the bundestag to vote on ? 
  also how comes that said proposal is part of their official [ program ] ( https://www.die-linke.de/fileadmin/download/dokumente/programm_der_partei_die_linke_erfurt2011.pdf ) ( page 69 ) ? 
  and andreas maurer is the fraktionsvorsitzender of die linke . 
  so it is not like some nobody inside of the party is in favour of accepting crimea as part of russia, 
  well die link want 's to dissolve the nato , so it is not suprising their voters are against it . 
  also yes at least parts of the linke support the annexation of crimea and the disbanding of the bundeswehr [ see my other post for sources ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/549nzm/labour_leadership_jeremy_corbyn_wins_landslide/d819480 ), 
  actually they do : [ regarding bundeswehr ] ( http://www.die-linke-hamburg.de/politik/diskussionen/detail/artikel/es-geht-auch-ohne-bundeswehr-aufloesen.html ) [ ragarding krim ] ( https://www.contra-magazin.com/2016/06/deutscher-politiker-appelliert-zur-anerkennung-des-krim-referendums/?pagespeed=noscript ) and as cherry on the top they also want to [ dissolve the nato ] ( https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2016/kw27-ak-sicherheit-frieden/433592 ) how anybody can think it is acceptable to vote for die linke is beyond me, 
  yea , that was otto von bismarck . 
  yet the whole refugee crises is somehow germanys fault according to this sub . 
  i highly doubt it . 
  after 5 years [ only 50 % percent ] ( http://doku.iab.de/aktuell/2015/aktueller_bericht_1514.pdf ) of the refugees are employed . 
  all in all those people are having a lower education than the average german ( page 5 of the linked report ) . 
  most of the employed refugees will work in low payed jobs for unskilled people because [ 70 % of the refugees are canceling their job training ( ausbildung ) ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/handwerkskammer-in-bayern-70-prozent-der-fluechtlinge-brechen-ausbildung-ab-13857887.html ) . 
  so far there is no reliable data about how much money this all will cost but according to the university of freiburg the intake of the las years refugee influx could mean a new debt of [ 450 billion euros ] ( http://www.fnp.de/nachrichten/politik/fluechtlinge-verschaerfen-probleme-des-alternden-sozialstaats;art673,1913610 ) for the german state . 
  and this is only from a monetary point of view , completely ignoring the growing friction in society and the rise of the far right . 
  oh look , a redditor who thinks repeating the same overused joke over and over again has something to do with humour . 
  hi there !, 
  in the 70s germany suffered from a series of terror acts commited by the rote armee fraktion . 
  the german state managed to shut down those terrorists without taking away all civil rights of the population . 
  you can do such thing with the help of a magic tool called profiling ... 
  i am not very well versed when it comes to turkish history , but did n't turkey had similar coups in the 90s ( to uphold its secular state ) which turned out okayish ? 
  well , that is ... unexpected . 
  many germans like poland as well :-) sadly it 's the angry people who are always the loudest, 
  bad enough that the leave side had no post brexit plan but you would at least expect the tories to have some . 
  after all they where the one who planed and scheduled the referendum . 
  i mean everyone else in the eu seems to have a plan ... 
  should n't have joint eu in the first place , if you do n't like it, 
  the headline is misleading . 
  only unconventional fracking ( fracking done near the surface ) was baned . 
  for conventional fraking each bundesland has to decide wether they will allow it or not . 
  lol szydlo 's statements are pure comedy gold  `` we ask brussels to respect the treaties and agreements we signed '' says a pis party member who would not respect the agreements their predecessor goverment agreed to  `` solidarity , responsibility and sovereignty have to be respected and have to be preserved ''  solidarity , responsibility  solidarity like when you guys showed solidary to the greek people by trying to shut down all remaining eu borders ? 
  well yes , i have no hard time to belive that the qouta is better in fachhoschulen . 
  but regardless of that , i know in germany is the percentage of higher educated people with migration backround significant lower than for ethnic germans . 
  and if i remember correctly , i read that this figure is especially low for turkish males . 
  might have something to do with how our education system works . 
  haha , well but you would raise my ex-muslim quota at 100 percent , so i gladly accept your offer ;-), 
  i am part of that 62 percent . 
  it is not even that i am trying to avoid muslims its just that there are none in my peer group . 
  i live in one of the biggest german city and i used to grow up with lots of immigrants and had quite a few turkish friends . 
  however the older i got the less of them stayed my friends , simply because most of them droped out of school early and we lost the contact . 
  the percentage of muslims in german universities is quite small . 
  so , there are a lot of higher educated people who will have very little contact to them in their daily life . 
  now i am working in a white collar job and there is not one single muslim in our company . 
  so there is no wonder why i have no muslims in my circle of friends . 
  i am so sick of hearing about all those crimes committed by the deutsche bank . 
  they lost me as a customer because of all the bullshit they are constantly pulling . 
  just checked your profile and noticed that you are actually living in germany . 
  lol , seems like you are not enyoing your time here . 
   yes , by convoluted turn of events germany again is becoming the top anti-semitic country in europe . 
  it 's so entertaining to watch this . 
  one reported incident , does not make germany a `` top anti-semitic country '' . 
  i do n't doubt that there are more incidents but over all anti semitism in germany is quite low compared to other european countries . 
  but feel free to back up your claims with a source . 
  on a side note whats up with your constant shitposting about germany ? 
  when ever there is a thread about my country i see you bitching and moaning . 
  countries which are in pre - or accession status recieve money from the eu as help for their reforms . 
  so juncker is telling erdogan `` introduce the death penality and we will stop paying you money '', 
   the police told the protesters several times to take down the \u00d6calan banners . 
  because the protesters did n't comply , the police recorded them on video . 
  that will teach them !, 
  wtf ? 
  greece is a sovereign state . 
  it is not on us to speak on your behalf . 
  there are allready enough people who believe that germany is trying to control europe . 
  italy is a net contributor, 
  thanks !, 
  for the first time in 5 years i did not miss it :-), 
  every one but poland voted for donald tusk . 
  pis : `` it 's all germanys fault ! '', 
  i have never heard anybody saying this , who was n't straight up a nazi . 
  the article i linked in my comment before claims those voters went to the afd and it seems most of the media agrees with this point of view . 
   the shift seems to be from spd to cdu and from cdu to afd while linke , gr\u00fcne and fdp are really stable for years now . 
  actually die linke lost quite a few [ voters to the afd ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/umfrage-waehler-von-linkspartei-und-afd-stehen-sich-nahe-14439928.html ) , which makes sense because both are populist protest parties . 
  he is a canadian living and working in germany , so it is pretty much his business as well . 
  also , this is an open board were everybody is free to discuss what ever he/she likes . 
  if you do n't like seeing americans or canadians discussing european matters , than maybe you should ' t be visiting this website . 
  how so ? 
  you did n't belived the perpetrators were mostly from arab and north african origin and i provided you a source for it . 
  you said it was blown out of porption and i argued that mass sexaul assults are nothing common here and that those attacks have to be seen in relation to the refugee crises . 
  but i guess it does not fit your narative so you are simply trying to brush it away . 
  like you said in one of your post :  do n't change , reddit !, 
  feelz always beat realz !, 
   according to albers , who was subsequently transferred to provisional retirement for his handling of the situation , the alleged perpetrators were all men `` of arab or north african appearance '' between the ages of 15 and 35 , who could not speak german . 
  [ 1 ] [ 9 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] the perpetrators were reported to have been several groups of heavily intoxicated men of arab or north african appearance , who emerged from a gathering of up to 1,000 men from the wikipedia [ article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_year%27s_eve_sexual_assaults_in_germany#cologne )  as i said , it became big as a symbol , not because what happened is `` big '' . 
  i do n't know how things are in baw\u00fc but here in nrw or at least cologne it is quite unusual to have a group of 10 to 40 men encircling women and sexual assulting them . 
  especially when you suddenly got more than just one of these groups, 
   why would they ? 
  2 people getting fingerbanged , a dozen getting groped and a few dozen getting catcalled is pretty much the definition of local news . 
  what happened was n't newsworthy on a national ( or international ) stage ; it was newsworthy because of the reaction .
