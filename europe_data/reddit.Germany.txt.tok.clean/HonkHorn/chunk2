  the two i know personally are by far the kindest persons you could imagine . 
  but it 's safe to wear them if you have cute / r/feet, 
  the difference might be that the swr took it on their own to not invite the afd whereas in certain other countries the government tells the station who attends and who does n't . 
  at least that 's what i understand the pis potts do in potato 's land . 
  now ** that ** sounds interesting . 
  hope you were n't trafficked to a german brothel or something . 
  fabio . 
  is that you ? 
  they hate us cause they ai n't us !, 
   also , look at a map - the large population and industrial cities - basel , bern , geneva , zurich , lucern - are all in the northern plain which is easily accessible from germany without having to deal with mountain passes or significant water obstacles . 
  germany is certainly not interested in invading other countries if that is what you wanted to insinuate . 
  years ago somebody told me if you work in localization ( l10n ) you can pack a suitcase , fly to dublin and find a job within a few days . 
  is this still the case ? 
  dude , chill . 
  seriously , chill . 
  you come across like somebody who thinks he 's a mix of the rock , vin diesel and liam neeson living like their movie characters . 
  not sure which case you mean . 
  but the guy in montana got 70 years for killing a german exchange student who entered his garage . 
  all consentual . 
   in practice , what happens is that many people go to less reputable driving schools which are only concerned with making money , not putting safe drivers on the roads . 
  so , for a little extra paid to the driving school , you can get your medical and psychological exams without even seeing a doctor . 
  you can pass the legislative course without even attending it . 
  also , instead of the required 30 hours of driving , shitty driving schools actually make you drive 10 or 15 , then just say you finished the practical training . 
  the theoretical exam might seem difficult , but you do n't actually need to learn the legislation , if you do practice tests for a few days before the exam , you will learn most answers by heart and most likely pass it . 
  the practice test lasts 10-15 minutes at most , which imho is not enough to judge how good/bad a driver someone is . 
  this sounds like the kind of driving school germans are looking for when they lose their licence for alcohol or drugs . 
  better than waiting a cool down period and passing a psychological examination before you 're allowed to take your licence test again . 
  `` you do n't need to know where i want to go '', 
  and they know how to get rich i tell you . 
  had about 30 lessons before the test at 19 when i got my car licence and 20 years later it was another 30-35 lessons for the motorcycle . 
  they want you to perform quite a few tricks on the motorcycle during the test which can be quite difficult to learn when you 're older . 
  so i payed about 2k for that alone . 
  is the girl in # 1 humping the car or is she clinging to it for fear of falling ? 
  but cute . 
  i bet in germany she would have been taken home by a guy after her first or second drink . 
  i take it english blokes do n't do that but prefer getting pissed ? 
  that 's only the english tourists there tbh . 
  that 's a weird tradition . 
  when did it start and why ? 
  i have fond memories of being a shortwave listener . 
  my favorite station was one in which a woman constantly read out numbers in german . 
  it felt like being in a spy movie . 
  i 'm not sure the amount of pages you manage to read of a book is a good indicator of its quality . 
  i mean , i could n't read more than 5 pages of ulysses and that 's certainy a well regarded book , no ? 
  ugh , that reads a bit like the bavarian government has changed their mind with regard to reprinting mein kampf . 
  but i think the copyright simply expires next year . 
  not much they can do now . 
  semantics, 
  true , 
  i 'm not going to disclose this information of myself but just some food for thought : there are people who claim that on a typical smartphone or kitchen sink brush there are way way way more bacteria and germs than you could ever encounter on a toilet . 
  what do you think about that ? 
  i want to know about their diet then , 
  at least you can sit on the depicted toilet . 
  i always wonder what people in countries with a tradition of squat loos do when they are constipated or have the runs . 
   my poop makes me strong only if you eat it . 
  that 's nothing . 
  some of our girls go to men 's toilets in clubs and shit into the pissoirs if the women 's toilets are crowded ( as they seem to be usually , do they socialize in there ? ), 
  weapons of mass destruction ... 
  this is exactly what would happen , would n't it ? 
  `` romanian business is made at the bar or in bed '' i already like romania . 
  hard to learn and harder to pronounce . 
  i tried to learn czech once but had to give up quickly . 
  in / r/de you are ... just try it . 
  very cool , thanks !, 
  i would n't underestimate them . 
  1987-1991 how could i find out how much my former apprentice salary would be worth now ? 
  that 's true and i think most of these companies do that . 
  well , since snowden i think you ca n't be paranoid enough . 
  so you are actually believing the stories about prevented terrorist attacks at railway stations and stuff ? 
  i rather think they are just the necessary narratives to further cut down our freedoms . 
  but the good jobs in germany are often passed to friends and family as well . 
  i can cite two examples of the last company i worked in . 
  the support department never posted job ads after it was founded because every new hire was the friend or family member of one of the persons in the team . 
  when the company wanted to poach a `` rockstar '' from a different company for one of their c level positions this guy made it a requirement that one of his friends would be offered a job on director level or he would n't join . 
  the company caved . 
  :-( i 'm sure every employee in germany could tell you similar anecdotes . 
  but in reality there are professions which heavily rely on their apprentices doing real work . 
  i 'd say all professions involved in building houses are guilty of this . 
   but get paid a lot less . 
  ( c. 500-600 $ / month in the first year after taxes and obligatory insurance ) really ? 
  that much ? 
  when i went through my apprenticeship ( wasted time in hindsight ) in the dem era i made about 700 dem before taxes . 
  yes , actually there is a problem . 
  the company i used to work for hired one programmer with an apprenticeship background in more than 6 years . 
  one and they hired often because they use a self programmed software to make money which needs a lot of programmers to be improved and maintained . 
  every other programmer was hired based on if he or she was in university . 
  so even in a country with apprenticeships being a good alternative to studying the apprenticeships can have a bad reputation leading to not being hired . 
  oh right , it 's ** that ** time of the year again . 
  i thought all these flavors were put into the coffee as self defense when i was in the us and had to do grocery shopping . 
  i bought a french roast coffee and it was so bad without milk and flavors ... 
   instead we have saudi arabia funding the worst of the extremisms . 
  you write this as if you have proof . 
  what ** is ** your proof , infidel ? 
  but he 's speaking very fluently . 
  is it so important to speak without an accent ? 
  or with an adopted one like german pupils do who were exchange students in the usa ? 
  this is wrong for germany . 
  completely wrong . 
  not true . 
  every german cop would make your day very bad for pot .
