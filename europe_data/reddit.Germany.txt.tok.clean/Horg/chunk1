yeah , shitty ones . 
  i owned one . 
  of course . 
  in germany , we do n't elect the chancellor directly as well - we vote for members of parliament who then vote for the chancellor . 
  the eu works similarly . 
  well ... at least we have [ someone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_gerst ) in space right now . 
  poland can only dream . 
  i just ate a huge plate of awesome food at my favorite chinese restaurant for $ 4.50 plus $ 2.50 for a pint of beer . 
  you are so german , it 's awesome . 
  it 's just a stupid reddit meme . 
  do n't worry . 
  yeah . 
  it seems to be a private youtube channel filmed in her own basement . 
  i 'm sorry , but this video is shit . 
  the german woman hosting `` israel today '' ( think about that name for a second ) is not even on a tv channel , it 's a private youtube channel and obviously filmed in somebody 's basement . 
  her vocal intonation is of someone who has never spoken on camera before and untypical of german tv broadcast . 
  next time , check wikipedia for the respective country 's biggest public network and maybe find a news clip from there . 
  i actually just got my first real job yesterday after 8 months of unemployment and years of university . 
  yay !, 
  congrats and welcome !, 
  bring lots of warm coats , winter has already started this week . 
  well , it depends a bit on popularity at the particular time , or popularity in retrospect . 
  i would say helmut schmidt . 
  why would you prefer a painful and long piss ? 
  well , there are also counter-examples . 
  when she ran for the first time in 2005 , one of the most contentious issues was raising the vat from 17 % to 19 % which the spd and the vast majority of the public opposed but the cdu supported . 
  and ultimately it got raised to 19 % . 
  also the esm measures were largely unpopular . 
  there is already a comment about the political side of merkel , so i 'll write something more personal . 
  angela merkel grew up in old communist east germany , has a phd in physics , quantum chemistry to be precise . 
  her husband is also a chemistry professor , who still works in his job . 
  she speaks very little english , but some russian . 
  people appreciate that she is very down to earth . 
  she lives in a small private appartment in berlin [ ( link to google streetview - notice the tiny cop car and 2 cops who usually stand in front of it ) ] ( https://www.google.de/maps?q=berlin&amp;hl=de&amp;ll=52.520301,13.395494&amp;spn=0.001686,0.004699&amp;sll=52.593676,9.126042&amp;sspn=6.869291,19.248047&amp;hnear=berlin&amp;t=m&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.520382,13.395386&amp;panoid=6xsi6an7gu7c8ddehjhlnq&amp;cbp=12,226.18,,0,-23&amp;z=19 ) and does her own shopping and cooking , at least a few times a week if time permits . 
  there are numerous photos of her standing at the checkout in the supermarket . 
  she has suprisingly high approval ratings , which is unusual for a politician in a democracy after 2 terms . 
  anyway , here is good documentary about her from the bbc ( 1 hour ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsa82z6dig edit : formatting, 
  as someone from hamburg , fuck him . 
  edit : ok , that might have been too harsh . 
  maybe he was a wonderful person and nobody deserves to die like him . 
  but i despise what he and others describe as `` art '' . 
  spraying countless ugly name tags everywhere is not art . 
  i humbly disagree . 
  i think the big parties in germany are actually doing a pretty good job . 
  my advice : choose a topic with a clearly defined beginnging and ending , and with clear connections to other topics . 
  the major wars might be too big of a topic and cost a lot of time . 
  this is now europe 's hymn . 
  listen to it at full volume . 
  [ globus - europa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc56moy0poa ), 
  very nice !, 
  but i 'm afraid this thread will soon be flooded with people who argue about every little aspect of it . 
  :d for example , the german drinking sound `` schl\u00fcrf '' is for trying to suck in small quantities of drink from an almost empty cup , or for drinking something very hot . 
  the english equivalent might be `` slurp '' . 
  the `` gulp '' sound is for something different , probably swallowing . 
  ( 3 ) go back to using nuclear, 
  as long as he plays a creepy dude . 
  as a star trek fan , i thoroughly enjoyed turkey, 
  i remember that from ages ago . 
  bash ? 
  yesterday i was two minutes late to visiting at a friend 's house , i honestly felt terrible . 
  especially americans are under the assumption that all germans adore david hasselhoff and that we think he is the best musician ever . 
  we do n't . 
  seriously . 
  the older i get , the more i discover that almost all stereotypes about germany are true . 
  except the david hasselhoff one perhaps . 
  i for one really like how they look, 
  yeah , came here to say tatort . 
  it might even be available with subtitles, 
  for german standards , this is about twice to what you pay in a pub . 
  you are germany 's hat !, 
  there was a statistic recently that germans work less hours than almost anyone else in europe . 
  i visited many fascinating castles in poland !, 
  i forgot their names but it was awesome . 
  i 'd vote `` no '' . 
  because it 's fucking silly and petty . 
  not in my opinion , no . 
  mercedes generally , and especially older models have a strong `` senior citizen '' image and do n't appeal much to young people . 
  if you want to look cool at the disco , you would probably need a bmw or if you do n't have much money , maybe an older vw or similar . 
  yes . 
  is mandatory . 
  however , when my great-grandpa was working in poland , they preferred using trains . 
  ordinary retired people in their 80s with thick glasses and beige clothing . 
  if you want to be a russian mobster in germany , you better drive a damn brand-new s-class , not a 30 year old car !, 
  when i tilt my laptop sideways while in this thread , water is pouring out, 
  i think it 's one of these things were hardly anyone ( maybe no one ) ever actually did it but it 's being referenced for shock value all the time . 
  i just cancelled my croatia vacation because of this post !, 
  most germans i know use it too . 
  `` everything '' you say , hmmm ? 
  guys , let 's stand around this biscuit ... 
  oh , i always thought the `` i '' was silent . 
  i 've been saying dutch-ah all the time . 
  wow !, 
  i had no idea this bot existed . 
  good job , bot !, 
  ok , but let 's leave poland behind . 
  [ let 's all sing our anthem !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc56moy0poa ) the cruelest of atrocities europa 's blood is born of these, 
  yeah , but mexican food is extremely rare in germany for example . 
  supermarkets like lidl or aldi do n't carry a single mexican item , like tortillas . 
  i love that shit and it drives me mad .
