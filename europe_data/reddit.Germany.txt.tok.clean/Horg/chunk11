  this year everything is so lame ... :(, 
  everything is quite shitty up to now . 
  is there anyone in the contest over the age of 25 ? 
  nobody says germany :(, 
  my first thought as well . 
  it 's my favorite tv show from your island . 
  meanwhile we still have the highest consumer electricity prices in the world . 
  it 's more likely because of east germany . 
  keep in mind that 1/5th of germans are from the east where russian was a mandatory second language until 1990 . 
  good post , thanks for the work . 
  i would consider explaining the acronyms in the picture , updating with some of the comments of this thread , and posting it to r/dataisbeautiful, 
  go away with your logic . 
  it 's clearly from the future !, 
  i 've been to netherlands , belgium , france , denmark , poland , russia . 
  just like my grandpa . 
  i had better weather though . 
  i recently moved to a different state for a new job and i 'm quite lonely . 
  had a lot of friends at my old place . 
  the joys of being an adult . 
  i think you are being ridiculously overdramatic, 
  well , you know what they say about fucked up german porn , right ? 
  [ ah , the old reddit frencharoo !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/3ey1a2/putting_a_gif_through_deep_dream/ctjwxhj?context=6 ), 
  good start , still not enough . 
  here it is , for anyone interested : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmusv-7bmzm, 
  i remember a merkel aide saying that merkel and holland speak english with each other , as long as the topic is relatively simple . 
  both their english is not very good . 
  yay !, 
  if we germans start finally building some stuff on our side , maybe it will even be operational before 2050 !, 
  it was not a causation that i was making at all ... but since everyone is completely misreading my comment i guess i am at fault here  i brought finland 's size ( population ) into it as a contributing factor for the likelihood of the president doing mundane stuff like calling a radio station ... nothing else . 
  i 'm not talking about corruption at all ... this might have been my most misunderstood comment ever, 
  consulting the list above , i am shocked that '' ** let the right one in ** '' from sweden is n't mentioned . 
  it 's one of my favorite overall movies !, 
  98 % on rotten tomatoes !, 
   finland is one of the most equal countries in the world , where politicians enjoy few formal privileges over regular people compared to other countries . 
  humble bragging aside , i think a big factor is also that finland is rather small . 
  ** edit : ** almost everyone completely missed the point of my comment . 
  ( i guess it 's my fault for being ambiguous ) . 
  the article implies that a president calling a radio station about something mundane and it not causing a big commotion is linked to social equality and politicians enjoying few privileges in finland . 
  as opposed to america for example , where the president would never call a radio station out of the blue to talk about gardening or whatever . 
  i merely thought that it 's not so much about equality and privileges , but more about finland having a small population where bumping into the president in everyday life might happen more often than in other countries . 
  international comparisons usually account for that . 
  wow !, 
  so it almost doubled in size ? 
  i really like the idea behind this post . 
  it truly looks like any medium-sized city in the states . 
  come on down to cleveland town , everyone !, 
  i think it 's simply a mistake , like a typo . 
  reliable temperature records in germany go back to 1761 ... what the hell are you even talking about edit : extensive article : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeitreihe_der_lufttemperatur_in_deutschland, 
   40 degrees is rare , but in no way weird . 
  it happens every year . 
  that 's not true . 
  40 degrees happened on exactly 2 days in the past 150 years and the all time maximum is 40.2 degrees . 
  note that these are `` official '' temperatures held to a certain standard - in the shade , far away from buildings or pavements and measured with a very precise thermometer . 
  a thermometer in the sun will easily display 10-20 degrees more than that . 
  they most certainly do n't ... 
  the all time heat record anywhere in germany is 40.2 \u00b0 c. 
  it has never been hotter . 
  maybe 38 or 39 i guess, 
  the german weather service is now issuing a warning for the western parts of the country against major thunderstorms with up to 60 l/h and golfball-sized hail in the later afternoon and tomorrow . 
  if you have a car , better park it somwhere indoors . 
  not really . 
  the presenter has a slight swiss accent , but it 's mostly standard german , although spoken quickly with some technical words . 
  oh damn , i puzzled for minutes over your comment , not getting it until just now . 
  wo n't edit my comment though . 
   40 \u00b0 is n't so bad . 
  we often stay above 40 \u00b0 for three months straight . 
  well yeah , that 's the point . 
  when you are used to such temperatures , it 's a completely different situation . 
  i 've spent some time in the us and stayed in australia for a year and in my experience the human body needs a few weeks to adjust to a new `` baseline '' . 
  just 2 weeks ago my car thermometer said 6 degrees in the morning and everyone was wearing long pants , sweatshirts and jackets . 
  that 's the normal german baseline . 
  in our entire country 's history we have hit 40 + temps exactly twice -- once in 1983 , once in 2003 . 
  nobody owns ac units . 
  nobody owns a pool ( ok , some execptions ) . 
  nobody owns fridges that make ice cubes . 
  i work in a high-tech modern office building built in 2007 -- and it does n't have an ac unit , just very good heating . 
  that 's why everyone is going crazy over here , 
  the whole weather report is limited to about 45 seconds , so they have to keep it as simple and effective as they can . 
  my guess is that the two numbers represent the highest and lowest temps for that day and that the rest of the country will be like a gradient between the two . 
  on the other hand , forecasts more than 2 days in advance are horribly unreliable anyway . 
  watch a little longer !, 
  this weather report is a bit unusual because it is part of the 15 minute evening news and therefore can not be longer than a few seconds itself . 
  most traditional german weather reports have a host , more detailed graphics , and usually a cat . 
  you need to visit some nice beegardens !, 
  is german efficiency . 
  i w\u00f6rked a lot monday to thursday -- and today it was extremely hot and also a friday and kinda slow so more time for reddits !, 
  but i will w\u00f6rk a bit from home this weekend because i feel bad . 
  need to increase gdp !, 
  oh , i think the aussies are the grandmasters of that . 
  in germany the forecast for tomorrow is unchanged with a max of 40 degrees in the south . 
  our own all time record is only 40.2 \u00b0 ( hah , beat you there ! ), 
  so there is a good chance that it might be broken if 40 degress are forecast for 2 days in a row . 
  our black people are quite nice too !, 
  you can watch the video , that will answer some questions : http://wetter.tagesschau.de/deutschland/ honestly i do n't even know about some of the detailed questions like the position of the sun in the grapic  in any case , these 3 panels are simplified for the 3-day forecast beginning the day after tomorrow . 
  the forecast for tomorrow is in much more detail . 
  in general , germany is small enough that you cane give a rough forecast for the whole country - maybe with the exception of the coastlines . 
  i think it 's fine for a few hours to show a stance against some of reddit 's mod practices , which really seem problematic . 
  but i really do n't care about reddit drama . 
  i even think woody harrelson 's rampart ama was n't all that bad .
