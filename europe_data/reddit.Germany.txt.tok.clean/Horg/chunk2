  the taco thing really perplexed me . 
  i was in sweden just a few weeks ago and even tiny supermarkets in the countryside would have a huge taco/tortilla/burrito aisle . 
  i do n't remember that being the case 10 or 20 years ago . 
  any swedes who can explain ? 
  carbonated water, 
  lol england, 
  if you are into medieval cities and stuff , i 'd recommend skipping some ofthe famous tourist traps like neuschwanstein . 
  i actually do n't know a single german who has ever been to neuschwanstein . 
  germany has countless beautiful little medieval towns such as [ rothenburg ob der tauber . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/rothenburg_bw_4.jpg ) edit : okay , okay , rothenburg was a bad example as it 's itself is a bit touristy . 
  but there are thousand nice little other medieval towns where hardly ever a tourist ventures . 
  i heard some bavarian dude could become the next king . 
  * i 'm not sure i like this . 
  10/10 would invest in eastern poland, 
  too much finish for me to handle !, 
  i feel like chosing something generic english would be lame too ... so i go with sweden : [ nanne gr\u00f6nvall - h\u00e5ll om mig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9197gtl1asg ) this video version includes an anime that some fan edited to fit with the music !, 
  this always makes me want to dance so much !, 
  did i woosh ? 
  edit : zomg !, 
  gold !, 
  i went to a lidl in sweden recently , it was quite well visited but very shabby . 
  it smelled funny too . 
  i love it !, 
  i 'm a big fan of skyscrapers . 
  i love lidl , it 's my favorite supermarket !, 
  not sure however if this is a good idea for an xoe post . 
  i mean ... it pretty much looks the same everywhere . 
  edit : apologies for missing the satirical note . 
  i am german :(, 
  this is by far the best lenin statue : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5t7wpvx.jpg ), 
  put one on m\u00f6lleh\u00f6j so it gets a little taller !, 
  not now !, 
  holiday time . 
  take it up with wikipedia , not with me . 
  country names of europe !, 
  i do n't think it 's necessary . 
  they are popular on this subreddit right now and will cease to be popular in 1-2 weeks max . 
  also i think we pretty much already burned through all meaningful `` x of europe '' topics . 
  people also appreciate a light-hearted sprinkle between all the serious political talk . 
  i would n't worry too much about clogging up the sub . 
  well , i think we have mostly run out of topics for that one anyway . 
  i mean , `` lowest points of europe '' is just going to be beaches and some silly place in holland . 
  itt : i dislike the national dish you chose for my country and i 'm going to argue that x is so much better !, 
  i think currywurst is a fine choice for germany . 
  but i acknowledge that this post lends to a lot of nit-picking , 
  yeah i thought about that , but i 'm probably going to keep it this way for now . 
  it just gets too complicated otherwhise . 
  thanks !, 
  fixed soon, 
  before clicking i thought it would be a duck, 
  i actually thought about including saba , but then i should also go for greenland as the highest point in denmark and south georgia ( near antarctica ) as the highest point in the uk . 
  they get dizzy from height sickness when standing on the millstone on the summit of m\u00f8lleh\u00f8j . 
  partially , yes . 
  i chose to include the caucasians , others might choose otherwhise . 
  yup . 
  and if you search for mount olympus on google , you get mostly pictures of mount olympus , utah . 
  thanks . 
  fixed . 
  there is a plaque and stuff i think !, 
  that was my biggest surprise too !, 
  i pulled most of the images from google picture search , so there is a chance that some of them are incorrect . 
  there are lots of mountains named olympus for example . 
  please post mistakes i made below this comment so i can fix them . 
  also one might argue that the inclusion of mount ararat and teide is geographically incorrect since they might be considered being part of asia/africa . 
  i chose country over physical geography for this selection . 
  this took way longer than i thought but i am quite pleased with the result . 
  something different than trains :d here is the list i used : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_highest_points_of_european_countries edit : more information . 
  the charging infrastructure is remarkably shitty . 
  there are countless competing providers , it 's quite expensive and you need to register with each company several days beforehand and acquire a service card . 
  and even then you will often only get a 3.6 kw schuko or 11 kw if you are very lucky . 
  meanwhile , tesla is installing 130 kw chargers everywhere , but i do n't want to pay 70k for a car ... 
  i do n't understand why the german state governments , car manufacturers and energy suppliers failed to form a consortium and build tesla-like high energy superchargers with one common plug and payment standard years ago . 
  now everyone just does his own little thing in his own little corner . 
  makes me angry . 
  i am highly envious of this  i think germany is one of the least ev-friendly countries in europe . 
  there are absolutely no incentives to buy an electric car , quite the opposite . 
  another fun fact : germany has the highest electricity prices in the world ( sometimes on par with denmark ) and - often overlooked - relatively cheap natural gas ( cng ) prices . 
  which leads to the unique situation that cng cars have lower `` fuel '' costs than electric cars if you charge your ev at home , in addition to cng cars costing maybe 30 % less than evs . 
  both the vw up !, 
  and vw golf are available as all-eletric or cng powered so there is good comparison . 
  and ugly houses, 
  why you no love us ? 
  :( we have slavic people too !, 
  the question is hard to answer since we are seriously best buddies with all our neighbors . 
  honestly , i do n't know anybody who holds a grudge against any of our neighboring countries , even in older generations . 
  most favorite among the entire population ( not just me ) would probably be france , by a slight margin . 
  [ somewhat relevant representative poll recently - `` trustworthy partners of germany '' ( imgur ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/myr6h2a.jpg ) least favorite among the general population probably poland because unfortunately some people associate it with crime and `` dey took er jerbs ! '' . 
  but it 's still a very much liked country . 
  another neighbor that some germans find `` irritating '' is probably switzerland , which is often accused of making it easy for rich germans to avoid taxes . 
  if azerbaijan becomes a member of the eu , this might be the tallest tower : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wl07zsu.jpg ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azerbaijan_tower 1050 m , 189 floors, 
  no , german trams best trams !, 
  the what ? 
  holy shit is that awful, 
  never been there , but it looks lovely on photos . 
  i have a lot of respect for turkish people , they seem to be hard working , reliable and mostly friendly . 
  the `` intellectuals '' from the istanbul region that i sometimes meet at my university are really great people . 
  however with the sometimes uneducated immigrants from anatolia i dislike their tendency to overzealous pride and inability to understand and deal with irony or sarcasm . 
  i see the eu mostly as an economic union , so sure , why not . 
  but in any case it will take decades . 
  yeah , seems rather shitty .
