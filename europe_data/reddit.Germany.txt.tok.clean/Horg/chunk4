  like frozen chicken bits with fries out of the oven . 
  it 's ok . we love you nonetheless . 
  you are a weird people . 
  has anyone ever told you that ? 
  because op has n't mentioned it yet , here is my chance for some quick karma : - word of the year : groko ( abbr . 
  `` gro\u00dfe koalition '' * grand coalition between the two major german parties * ) - youth word of the year : babo ( * boss * , turkish origin ) - anti-word and phrase of the year not yet decided . 
  slow tv ? 
  is that about these norwegian tv shows where they stack firewood ? 
  i do n't know how to dutch , but i could imagine that `` selfie '' could become a nice first name for dutch newborn girls . 
  do n't worry , we are just getting too old for this . 
  i did n't know it either , and i 'm only 25 . 
  also these damn kids need to get off my lawn !, 
  i think the eesti one was fine because the language is so weird and many country names had an interesting story to it . 
  also it was new and fresh . 
  but i agree , we should n't add more . 
  my german map did n't get much love either . 
  damn it eesti and suomi , saxony is only a part of germany and i am not saxon so stop calling me that !, 
  ( if the dutch can complain about that all the time , i can too ! ), 
  we call it `` west spain '' when we think they wo n't notice . 
  lol coincidence , we call it \u00d6sterreich as well !, 
  i would n't put too much seriousness into forums like those . 
  they are just echo chambers and often disconnected from reality . 
  we have seen the same disconnect with the afd before the bundestag election . 
  forsa polled spd members 2 weeks ago and predicted 78 % agreement . 
  the result today is hardly a surprise to anyone who payed attention . 
  i agree . 
  the term `` liberal '' has so many alternating meanings that i 've stopped using it completely . 
  i prefer `` progressive '' myself . 
  i do n't understand the position of almost all my fellow germans in this thread . 
  i think it 's a great result for the spd and i 'm quite happy with a grand coalition , which is also what the vast majority of germans preferred over any other constellation . 
  i do n't want to start a big politics discussion here , just putting it out there that there are people like me who are quite happy with the situation . 
  please do n't downvote me because you have a different opinion . 
  this makes no sense . 
  declining the coalition agreement would have meant political irrelevancy right now . 
  there really was no option . 
  you think anybody would have voted for the spd in hypothetical re-elections again ? 
  it would have been absolute majority for merkel for 4 years . 
  also keep in mind that the spd left the kiesinger coalition much stronger than the cdu . 
  just because they did n't do well during 2005-2009 does n't make it a law of nature . 
  however , the right translation for `` wunder '' would be `` miracle '' , [ `` wonder '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wonder ) translates more like `` erstaunen '' . 
  76 % may seem like a lot , but it 's pretty much exactly what has been forecast by opinion polls for weeks . 
  edit : 78 % was the result of the most recent opinion poll ( spd members only ) 2 weeks ago . 
  side note : a better term would be `` child prodigy '' . 
  `` wonder child '' probably does n't make sense to non-german speakers . 
  there is a crisis in your pants . 
  this is not a binary decision , it depends on many factors for me . 
  if i get a good job offering , sure . 
  i always enjoy being in the u.s. - nice weather , great people , some great scenery . 
  the biggest drawback would be the distance from a lot of people i care about here in the fatherland . 
  i honestly do n't care that much about crime or health care on a personal level , those are political topics for me . 
  both pretty much, 
  i know nothing about economy and do n't know if this is good or bad . 
  the amount of circlejerk in this thread is too damn high !, 
  but no holocaust this time . 
  gives bad press :( everyone !, 
  let 's meet in belgium and have another world war !, 
  what about my german ? 
  to be honest , the narrative of the video feels kind of smug . 
  you can be a part of it if you like, 
  well i guess they want nice food and are unhappy because they are ... hungary . 
  get it ? 
  but he has german name !, 
  he is german in disguise !, 
  am of sorry . 
  wow , that looks like a nice subreddit !, 
  thanks !, 
  i will post my memes there now . 
  edit : i was of joking . 
   jerusalem post  tight budget yeah ... uhm , well you see ... never mind . 
  it 's the most pathetic excuse ever . 
  it does n't really make any sense . 
  imagine if he said in english `` hang the jews ! '', 
  and then later went `` i meant juice !, 
  guys ? 
  j-u-i-c-e ... like in apple juice , you know ? 
  i wanted to hang some apple juice on the trees ... because that would be nice ... 
  seriously , guys , pls believe me ! '', 
  i for one am quite happy we have n't anschlussed austria yet so i can still point my finger at them and say `` haha ! '', 
  reunification with austria . 
  but they do n't know it yet . 
   like it is spoken , we say 10 euro not euro 10 . 
  that does n't necessarily follow ... americans and most others also say `` 50 dollars '' when talking but write $ 50 . 
  germany 2 . 
  before . 
  $ 50 look nice to me nowadays . 
  might be american influence . 
  but it 's just personal taste . 
  mostly after - like `` 50 dm '' in advertising . 
  but i also remember seeing it written before , but more in formal writing like `` the plaintiff is awarded the amount of dm 50.000 '' but not very often . 
  if the $ - sign is used , probably 80 % after , 20 % before . 
  however , in a lot of cases the currency is written out `` 50 euro '' instead of using the sign . 
  no idea why . 
  not being punctual would be grounds for impeachment in germany !, 
  sounds like we need a new acronym . 
  pings ? 
  68/200 i actually got a chinese city by randomly combining some `` shang `` s and `` zhou `` s and `` qi `` s `` chang `` s. 
  there already is an eu accord , but it 's smaller than the north american model . 
  honda actually offers both models in japan ( the bigger accord under a different name ) . 
  apologies for the title - obviously the quiz is about ** metropolitan areas or urban agglomerations ** . 
  i just figured a short precise title would be nicer and did n't know `` megacity '' meant something different according to some people  i hope you can have fun nonetheless .
