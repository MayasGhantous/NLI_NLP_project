  keep in mind that the quiz will also accept city names that are part of an agglomeration . 
  for example , entering `` dortmund '' or `` essen '' also gives you the ruhr area . 
  if you dont like agglomerations there is also an even bigger euro quiz ( 300 cities ! ), 
  that focuses solely on the actual city : http://www.sporcle.com/games/mr_l/euro300 when you play that quiz , you might see why i rather chose the agglomeration one for this thread . 
  the 300 quiz for example does n't include brussels because it is defined by some stupid law to be only the inner city core ( population 160k ) , a tiny percentage of what any common sense definition would call `` brussels '' . 
  huh . 
  you are obivously right . 
  i guess with that large number of cities a few mistakes happen . 
  i did n't make the quiz though . 
  it also pops up if you enter any of the cities included in it like dortmund or essen . 
  i tried `` how many european urban agglomerations can you name in 10 minutes ? '', 
  but it just does n't have the same ring to it . 
  the distinction between agglomeration and city is fuzzy anyways . 
  i think megacity is a nice compromise for a title . 
  only those in the european part are included . 
  russia 's third largest city , novosibirsk , is missing because it is east of the ural . 
  likewhise all turkish cities east of the bosporus . 
  but true , i also missed most of the russian cities in the quiz . 
  only remembered st. petersburg and moscow :(, 
  oh , i thought this thread was about building a beach car . 
  never mind . 
  i do n't want to brag , but i want to brag . 
  easy 100 % on the first try :d, 
  or extrapolate back and you will see that spain had 1.2 quadrillion inhabitants when the earth was formed !, 
  is it actually readable ? 
  i just entered german wikipedia 's article about apple pies into the google translator to fool people into thinking i can finnish . 
  a shovel is fine . 
  can we have the german parts then pls ? 
  people always forget about the german parts . 
  would you like to liberate youself from the danish tyrants ? 
  i * gas * it 's ok . ^ ^ oh ^ god, 
  that makes me sad :( i will now dig holes in your beach . 
  i 'm not good with jokes :( they confuse me . 
  you sound like the daily mail . 
  well , better than having to speak russian . 
  thanks !, 
  anywhere with nice beaches to dig holes into . 
  not all the sand is good quality though !, 
  holy smokes spain, 
  silly portugal , finns do n't talk that much . 
  one perkele is sufficient . 
  no wonder my grandpa preferred using trains . 
  ^ ^ that ^ ^ joke ^ ^ might ^ ^ have ^ ^ been ^ ^ over ^ ^ the ^ ^ line, 
  what is `` your 6 moons return 6 pieces of burning spruce trees '' ? 
  my moon is still intact , thank you very much !, 
  this is awesome . 
  i do n't want to sound too pedantic , but `` murder '' implies malicious intent for me . 
  like someone built that supermarket roof with the explicit reason to kill people with it . 
  everything else would be manslaughter at max . 
  or did something get lost in translation ? 
  terrible tragedy :( when something happens in germany , i 'm always interested how other country 's media reports on it ... so if latvians are interested , this is how german television reported on it : http://www.zdf.de/zdfmediathek/hauptnavigation/startseite#/beitrag/video/2033540/dacheinsturz-in-riga, 
  it 's not about the number of fatalities that made 9/11 what it is . 
  a german blog with weird baby names associated with lower class people . 
  a lot of germans ( and austrian & swiss ) like to proudly present the names of their babies on car decals or in the paper . 
  home brand $ 0.11 for half liter bottle , $ 0.19 for 1.5 l bottle . 
  usually simple food has the same price at all supermarkets ( aldi , lidl , rewe , etc. ), 
  nationwide . 
  obivously more at gas stations or football stadiums . 
  the national average is about 0.28 $ / kwh which makes germany one of the most expensive in the world afaik . 
  as an avid david hasselhoff fan ( i am german after all ) , this song is better : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ot_katyyiu, 
  generally , yes . 
  but i believe that to be a rather temporary thing . 
  maybe it 's not even that bad that the euro 2014 parliament will contain lots of euroskeptics . 
  i disagree with them on most levels , but maybe it will remind people why european politics matter . 
  not anymore in mine , my game tier is too high ... oooooohhhh yeeeeaaah . 
  i think most people would be fine with it . 
  21 and 16 ist still very close together . 
  i have already written an angry facebook post , so you could say things are definitely getting serious !, 
  we have a yearly kfz-steuer , which is in the order of about 50 euros for gasoline cars and about 200 for diesel cars . 
  we do n't have a special purchase tax for new cars that i know of . 
  in some scandinavian countries you can easily pay more than $ 100k in tax alone for some luxury cars , depending on emissions . 
  ww2 would have been fun with pacific hitler instead of atlantic hitler . 
  good question . 
  last time , we elected hitler . 
  i would n't recommend doing that again . 
  english titles only please . 
  even my grandpa used to tell that joke , so i think it is quite old . 
  a generation ago , british cuisine had indeed a very shitty reputation in europe , but nowadays you guys have completely reinvented yourself . 
  i often wondered about that as well . 
  a few theories : 1 . ), 
  munich olympics massacre of 1972 which was largely botched up by inexperienced german police . 
  the joke is quite old and might originate in the 70s 2 . ), 
  nazi gestapo or east german stasi 3 . ), 
  the notion of germans being cold , overly formal burocrats . 
  it was simply the only thing left over . 
  heaven : german = mechanics . 
  german = bad cooks ? 
  no ... has to be brits , german = bad organizers ? 
  no ... has to be italians . 
  to make the largest amount of stereotypes work for the joke a few will have to seem out of place . 
  holocaust . 
  19 % is just the normal sales tax on all goods ( you can even get it back if you use your car for your job ) , technically germany does n't have an extra acquisition tax like holland or scandinavia . 
  most germans do n't even know such a thing exists . 
  20 years ago my family bought a small stuga near a lake in the middle of sweden , very lovely and i spend a lot of my childhood there . 
  at that time we were the only germans there . 
  nowadays the majority of the stugas in that community are owned by germans . 
  i do n't like that :(, 
  not in every restaurant . 
  whether or not to serve alcohol is left to the discretion of the franchisee . 
  as a thuringian neo-nazi i feel sad that nobody loves me :(,
