  here is an entire episode : - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm0dvjwjiok here is one of my favorite segments : - http://youtu.be/cmtmigdjjqw?t=6m17s little guy gets it right at the very last second and the rest are pissed and pretend to leave the studio in protest . 
  * cue the wrong-answer-bell from qi *, 
  i politely but strongly disagree . 
  it had a few funny bits but the format is quite different . 
  genial daneben was more of a `` what is x ? '', 
  and the panel making dick jokes for 10 minutes . 
  the viewer does n't really gain much knowledge . 
  i gained a lot of trivia from watching qi . 
  do n't judge the show from the clip above , [ watch an entire episode !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3pljaxe07m ), 
  i can totally relate  i discovered qi a few months ago and am still trying to catch up ... most awesome tv panel show ever made . 
  i do n't blame romania . 
  far-righters in germany do the same thing . 
  ie 11 is the best browser in my opinion . 
  i switched from chrome to ie ( first 10 , now 11 ) when i bought my laptop which has a touchscreen . 
  chrome does n't have touchscreen support . 
  not sure if firefox does . 
  and gib oil monies !, 
  more co - ~ ~ occupation ~ ~ operation sounds lovely . 
  if you want to research the question yourself , [ here is google data explorer with all the stuff you need .

  west germany paid about $ 1 trillion for it . 
  do n't get me wrong , i think it was the right thing to do , but the development of the former gdr did n't come about by itself , so it 's hard to compare to other countries . 
  jesus , get a room already . 
  bmw recently invested about $ 3 billion into the i-project ( i3 and i8 ) electric cars . 
  to be honest , i think the headline is sensationalist . 
  bmw have always supported the cdu ( and the spd as well ) with regular donations and the timing with the co2 talks might be a coincidence . 
  a complete overview with all party donations since 2002 is published by the [ bundestag ] ( http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/parteienfinanzierung/fundstellen50000/2013/ ) . 
  i am not saying i like it -- it still smells fishy -- but we are no way near the american system . 
  in germany , campaigns are mostly publicly financed ( parties get money from the federal budget according to previous election results ) and another big chunk is membership fees . 
  the cdu gets about 14 % from donations .

  nevertheless we should all be wary of lobbyism and corruption . 
  that place does n't exist !, 
  there was no world cup !, 
  it 's not real !, 
  to be honest , i 've only been lurking there a few times , i ca n't really judge the quality of that board . 
  it seems to me that most users are british though . 
  a good forum for questions regarding moving to germany is toytown : - http://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/index.php?showforum=71 you might find better info there . 
  please do n't hate me , but that sounds a little naive . 
  i would n't come over unless you already have a job set up for you here . 
  fluency in german is important unless you are in an international environment ( stockbroker , scientist , etc. ) . 
  job market depends on your qualifications . 
  relocating to another continent is one of the biggest life-changing events . 
  do n't rush it . 
  precisely . 
  i did n't realize it was that bad for everyone else so uniformly . 
  this is r/europe and i care about all of europe . 
  * angela merkel is a poopyface !, 
  * will this sentence cause reddit to close down ? 
  of course ... 
  it never occured to me that some people would n't ... 
  the only manner i know from finland is mannerheim . 
  `` old swede '' fig . 
  `` woah ! '', 
  science education . 
  try to fit 20 ping pong balls in your mouth then and say `` m\u00e4shk '' . 
  done . 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 !, 
  some germans on this subreddit might complain that the couple went to affluent bavaria ( where unemployment rate is half the national average ) and on any discussion board it 's always popular to bash bavaria . 
  i think they did a very well job trying to display the average german familiy and average life in any place in the country . 
  i will probably put my future children in a waldkindergarten too . 
  as a hobby videographer , the composition , exposure and sound made me cringe . 
  jesus , just turn around 180 degrees so the sun is behind the camera . 
  the content was quite nice though . 
  to me it seems he actually adopted a danish accent . 
  yup . 
  i would suggest 4 days london and 6 days rome . 
  skip paris and florence . 
  maybe you should put all of these into a single thread instead of multiple . 
  yay !, 
  germany is in the smart countries club !, 
  ^ ^ ^ barely . 
  i do n't mind smokers at all . 
  smoking decreases your life expectancy by about 12 years . 
  average pension in germany is around 1500 euros . 
  therefore every smoker makes the pension fund save about 210,000 euros -- which results in more pension money for me once i retire . 
  yay !, 
  it actually took me a while to understand that the map is in german . 
  i spend too much time on reddit . 
  or just use your dad 's id card . 
  well , it 's the part of europe that 's relevant !, 
  join eu and you can into statistics graph too !, 
  ^ ^ also ^ ^ gib ^ ^ oil ^ ^ monies ^ ^ pls . 
  i care a lot but i do n't have any idea who to vote for . 
  impressive . 
  you are just jealous !, 
  well , no , as i said the word is completely different . 
  hm ... to me it sort of does . 
  i might be making stuff up now i guess . 
  yeah ok , but if you make a and e into \u00c6 why do n't you make o and e into \u0152 ? 
  yeah that 's true , i was oversimplifying a bit . 
  well it depends on the definition . 
  for some reason they are considered seperate letters in scandinavia and just `` umlauts '' in germany . 
  i guess that is because things like `` hand '' ( hand , singular ) changes to `` h\u00e4nde '' ( hands , plural ) . 
  however there are also a lot of words where it is a completely different letter . 
  `` ausl\u00f6sen '' ( to trigger something ) has no connection to `` auslosen '' ( to make a draw ) . 
  of course they are !, 
   how came up with mashing a and e together , crossing an o and drawing a cute little circle above the a ? 
  that 's not logical !,
