  languages should follow rules !, 
  especially \u00d8 and \u00c6 look like accidents , \u00c4\u00d6\u00dc is much more nice and pretty !, 
  * scratches balls *, 
  these letters are so weird and random . 
  the german version is much more clear : - \u00c4 \u00d6 \u00dc since your \u00c5 is like our o , your o like our u , and your u like our \u00dc - we come full circle . 
  interesting to see so many similarities . 
  names like `` luca '' or `` emma '' are in the german top 5 as well . 
  current # 1 for boys is `` ben '' however . 
  before that , `` leon '' was # 1 for almost a decade , it suddenly popped up around the turn of the millenium . 
  my cousin is an elementary school teacher , lots of leons in her classes . 
  not sure if serious or not ... 
  the sentence `` arthur est un perroquet '' brought back a lot of memories , 
  prost . 
  you 're shitting me ... you have the same fucking textbook as us ? 
  - makes a lot of cars for the vw group . 
  i always used to buy tyrkisk peber on the germany-denmark-sweden ferries in the big 400g packs but recently they have become so expensive !, 
  can northern germany join too ? 
  it 's the cheapest price i could find on the internet though . 
  my local supermarket offers them for 4.95 $ ( 20x0 .5 ) which is around 25 cents . 
  nevertheless , you might be better off buying bottled water . 
  oettinger . 
  edit : it 's actually the most widely sold beer in germany . 
  0.5 liter bottles are 0.19 $ to 0.30 $ . 
  who ? 
  i do n't want to sound like a dick , but i do n't understand why not more young greeks just go to canada or australia for a couple of years until the crisis has passed . 
  i spend 2 years working and travelling in australia after high school and it was actually more of a fun thing , but i could have earned quite a lot of money if i really wanted that . 
  everybody can . 
  hitler was nominated too . 
  fun exercise -- if you want to know the climate of your place in 2100 , a good approximation is this : look up the nearest city to you on ( english ) wikipedia and note the average temperature . 
  than add about 5 degrees to that temp ( 3 degrees global equals about 5 degrees in europe on land ) and try to find another city that roughly matches that temperature . 
  in my case , berlin plus 5 degrees gets me to rome . 
  therefore , the climate of berlin in 87 years will roughly be that of rome today . 
  thank you !, 
  i am keeping a big log of my porn browsing that i will e-mail the nsa once this whole ordeal is over . 
  we have to work together people !, 
  no way !, 
  so it 'll be almost like every other time before that !, 
  you mean he should czech out his id card ? 
  i think they are nice . 
  however i recently encountered a ticket machine for the berlin transit that did n't accept them . 
  my bank gives you several options after you chose an amount . 
  you can even have $ 100 in 20x $ 5 if you like . 
  i do that often it makes my purse much bigger and makes me feel rich :d, 
  context ? 
  `` arm '' in this cases rather translates to `` pitiful '' . 
  you 'll often find the phrase at the end of some idiot 's rambling online about how the banks/illuminati/jews control everything or how all politicians are corrupt or whatever and nobody besides the idiot rambling is realizing this . 
  like `` omg global warming is a lie but they are feeding propaganda to our kids in school ... armes deutschland ! '', 
  `` armes deutschland '' i utterly hate this one . 
  - beer - great and cheap food - classical music - very nice people who are quite good at english and know how to cater to tourists - lots of german last names - very long and turbulent history - after the fall of the iron curtain , many people opposed volkswagen taking over skoda because they did n't like germany . 
  20 years later , skoda is providing many jobs and is established as a well respected brand while many other privatized companies went bankrupt in the 90s . 
  as a german , this makes me slightly proud . 
  - beer - very nice cities . 
  i have n't even been to prague , but also the smaller places are awesome . 
  - [ jo\u017ein z ba\u017ein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3tg1x5ewag ), 
  is that `` you '' meant for me or in a general sense ? 
  if it is the latter , i might agree . 
  i thought everybody likes digging holes at the beach !, 
  7.3 % of people voted for them because they are disillusioned and unhapppy with the political and social situation -- and they know that voting for the npd would be the biggest fuck you in the face of the major parties and the establishment in general . 
  that does n't mean that 7.3 % of meck-pommers are neo-nazis or go around smashing in other people 's skulls with baseball bats . 
  however , you are right , they are a problem , especially in rural eastern germany ( where i live btw ) -- and people are well aware of this problem and fighting it whereever it crops up . 
  every now and then some asshole skinheads beat up a kid and it 's all over local news . 
  it 's just that ... it 's not on my radar , i do n't lie awake at night worrying about nazis . 
  i kinda care more about bigger things . 
  maybe that 's a mistake , i do n't know . 
  i really do n't think it 's that big a problem . 
  every country has its small percentage of crazy people . 
  they are an annoyance , but to me they do n't matter in the big picture . 
  less fear about the future . 
  who needs sunbathing ? 
  i go to beaches to dig holes . 
  they are cognates to german words which explains their different pronounciation of the vowel part . 
  - though - doch - thought - dach ( te ) - through - durch the german `` d '' and the english `` th '' share a common ancestor , which is still present in icelandic as the '' \u00d0 '' ( pronounced more like a `` th '' ) . 
  the `` ch '' sound in german is like clearing your throat and survived into english as a silent `` gh '' . 
  there are countless of words like these `` licht '' becomes `` light '' , `` nacht '' becomes `` night '' , `` macht '' becomes `` might '' , etc. 
  your right . 
  hey we got \u00e4\u00f6\u00fc too !, 
  zat is ze case !, 
  because cold . 
  well , the flag is a big plus . 
  there are a few nazi jokes in there , but i 'm too lazy right now . 
  hard : - `` th '' , since it does n't exist in my language . 
  i still have a very hard time pronouncing things like `` earth '' , it always sounds like '' \u00f6rf '' . 
  - the sheer amount of words . 
  it 's much much bigger than the german vocabulary . 
  many words do n't have a proper translation into german - more than the other way around . 
  - when i was a beginner , pronounciation was hard . 
  i think german pronounciation is quite easy after a while , because each syllable is isolated and does n't affect others . 
  also things like `` tomb '' and `` comb '' where pronounciation is based in history and does n't reflect in how it is written nowadays . 
  easy : - many simple words similar to german words . 
  - the fact that it is everywhere helps quite a lot . 
  i guess it depends on one 's native language . 
  as a german i find swedish easier . 
  fun fact : greenland was named so to be an opposite to iceland . 
  although being much icier . 
  i was there when i was younger for 5 weeks !, 
  it was super awesome . 
  a few things : - insanely beautiful and stark nature ... - ... unless it rains - almost no trees - volcanoes and geysers and glaciers and waterfalls and stuff - you can park you car , hike for 1 hour and find creeks with hot water where you can bathe in and enjoy the incredible view . 
  most awesome feeling ever !, 
  - very expensive food in the supermarket - even lots of young `` hip '' people wearing wool shirts , it seems the only nation not to care about the `` international young people dress code '' . 
  i like that .
