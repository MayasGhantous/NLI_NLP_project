  - very small population ... however with lots of internationally known artists - were utterly fucked by bankers big time during economic crisis . 
  i never really knew how things changed after that - nice language . 
  i know how to pronounce quite a lot of it !, 
  thats about it . 
  it alwas puzzles me that a large portion of the us election system is based on 18th century logistics , such as the dates between election and taking office being based on how long it takes to travel the country on horseback . 
  or the entire electoral college for that matter . 
  i guess it 's just part of america 's obsession with its constitution . 
  good question . 
  it 's technically possible as far as i know , but it would n't be able to get much legistlation done since any bills require a 50 % majority for passing . 
  i like it quite a lot and i think it is superior to other systems . 
  the changes i would make are more in the details . 
  - swap first vote and second vote as they appear on the ballot . 
  many rather uneducated folks think the first vote is the important one and the second vote unimportant . 
  changing the layout of the ballot would fix that . 
  - lower the threshold to 4 % . 
  i do n't even like the fdp and afd , but i 've always favored a slightly lower threshold . 
  when the federal returning officer publishes its results , which will happen around 1 a.m. current progress can be seen here : http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/btw_bund_13/ergebnisse/status/, 
  yep . 
  seems a real possibility , i included it . 
  true , fixed . 
  i think i mixed that up with ruling out coalitions with the left . 
  thanks . 
  technically possible , but they have both ruled out that option . 
  they had cdu + greens in state parliaments and it did n't end well . 
  ------------------- ** [ 02:15 ] - source : official results by the federal returning officer ** these results are pretty much final and will not change anymore , unless election fraud is discovered , which is extremely unlikely . 
  cdu/csu ( christian democrats , center-right ) : ** 41.5 % ** spd ( social democrats , center-left ) : ** 25.7 % ** greens ( environmentalists ) : ** 8.4 % ** linke ( socialists ) : ** 8.6 % ** - not in parliament ( 5 % needed ) : fdp ( economic liberalism ) : ** 4.8 % ** afd ( euroskepticism ) : ** 4.7 % ** pirate party ( internet politics , privacy ) : ** 2.2 % ** detailed listings in english : http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/btw_bund_13/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/index.html ------------------- possible coalitions : cdu/csu + spd : ** majority ** cdu/csu + greens : ** majority ** ** cdu/csu definitely no absolute majority as it seemed possible earlier . 
  ** ------------------- 18:36 - my commentary : - surprisingly big result for the cdu . 
  surprisingly poor for the greens . 
  fdp and afd as expected . 
  - fdp in or out will determine the election . 
  i estimate the possibility of the fdp getting above the 5 % is around 1 in 10 . 
  - afd in or out will be interesting , but is not that important in my opinion . 
  however , afd in parliament would rule out cdu/csu solo and spd + greens + left . 
  - grand coalition most likely outcome . 
  ** 18:50 ** - afd in zdf exit polls now at 4.9 % up from 4.8 % . 
  fdp down to 4.4 % from 4.5 % ( 19:02 - up to 4.6 % again ) ** 18:55 ** - fdp down another 10th of a point . 
  cdu/csu now with possible absolute majority ( 23:25 -- not so much now ) ** 20:15 ** - absolute majority hinges on just a very few votes . 
  it 's possible we wo n't see a definite result before midnight . 
  the only other alternatives are a grand coalition or a cdu/csu + green coalition , the latter of which is very unlikely . 
  ** 23:25 ** - absolute majority now considered unlikely . 
  i do n't even know what `` funny '' means . 
  i fail to see any logic or humour in this . 
  edit : and i should n't type on my tinyass phone, 
  i do n't think she speaks english `` well '' -- there are a few snippets available of her speaking english and it is obvious that she has a very strong accent and most likely can not command english beyond a few simple words of small talk . 
  in addition to that , you always appear weak and somewhat awkward when you try to convey complex topics in a language you only have basic skills in . 
  take this interview of then vice-chancellor and foreign minister guido westerwelle with the bbc : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkwcro8kja btw : her competitor , peer steinbr\u00fcck , speaks english quite well . 
  here is a very well worth seeing ad-lib speech at harvard about the euro crisis . 
  no , he does n't . 
  he appears to do so in the bundestag speech , but that speech was pre-written . 
  in german-russian press conferences he always uses an earpiece and a translator is present when he talks with german politicians . 
  yeah i guess i botched that up . 
  fixed it for clearness . 
  whoops , i honestly missed taenk 's comment when scrolling through the page quickly . 
  my bad . 
  das leben der anderen not only my favorite german movie , actually one of my favorite movies in general . 
  i do n't know jack shit , i 've never been more to the east than poland . 
  so here goes my prejudices : - dacia - corrupt politicians - surprisingly high number of romanians on the interwebs and in online games , those are also quite good at english unlike some of romanias neighbors - beautiful countryside - romanians always emphasizing that they are not gypsies . 
  - numa numa song yeah , that 's about it . 
  that 's a really nice explanation but i am beginning to wonder if r/europe might get tired of hearing german election stuff . 
  what a load of bullshit . 
  guido westerwelle is gay and one of germany 's most important politicians after merkel ( vice chancellor for a long time , foreign minister , etc. ), 
  and is definitely also the most ridiculed and criticised politician of the past 10 years in the entire country . 
  the gayness of the mayors of germany 's two biggest cities , hamburg and berlin , has also not protected them from the same crticism that any other politician in their position would get . 
  seriously , putin can go suck a dick . 
  i 've been closely watching a lot of state and federal elections ( and their polls beforehand ) over the past 15 years and i believe the chance of the afd crossing the threshold is quite high . 
  the have gained a lot of momentum in the past 2 weeks and momentum is what counts the most right now . 
  i disagree with almost the entire party platform , but i currently see the afd at around 5-6 .5 % . 
  i care a lot about politics but i honestly do n't know yet . 
  probably cdu or spd . 
  small point , but the ' - apostrophe is next to the return key , you are using a french accent \u00b4 which is not correct . 
  contemporary = anything that is n't schiller or goethe i also very much recommend `` herr aller dinge '' ( lord of all creation ) by eschbach -- i think it 's his best work and one of the best sci-fi novels i 've ever read in general . 
  and i have read a lot . 
  shame that it does n't get translated into english . 
  many of eschbachs works however get translated into french , italian , polish , etc. 
  i really urge anyone to check them out . 
  hmm ... little poland looks quite delicious just sitting there ... 
  pleasure ,

  great doc even if you are not a car person . 
  germany leading ... that gives me all the warm fuzzies ... 
  in germany , the holidays are individually set by each of the 16 states . 
  the total time is roughly the same , but the start and end dates vary deliberately to avoid traffic chaos and to even out the effects on the economy and tourism over a longer period of time . 
  that 's why the german bar is somewhat shaded i guess . 
  a lot of the links do n't work for me . 
  specifically , those that link to pay.reddit.com - what is up with that ? 
  yay , we did it !, 
  now gief moniehs back pls . 
  in germany it largely depends if your house is pre - or post-ww2 . 
  there are also large regional differences , but they will be most prominent in pre-ww2-buildings -- modern family homes pretty much look the same all over the country . 
  the most common type of family home built in the last 30 years will probably look something like this : http://i.imgur.com/l6qeugx.jpg clean , simple , boring . 
  possibly the spiegel scandal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spiegel_scandal, 
  germany : lots of hot air . 
  no seriously , we currently have the highest temperatures in all of europe . 
  forecast for today : http://imgur.com/npw4dre otherwise : mostly non-domestic news , train crash , egypt , etc. 
  well to be honest , it 's hard to make schmetterling sound poetic . 
  i 've only seen albania from pictures and it seems like a very lovely country that i want to visit some day -- but i have to be honest , the first thought when i here `` albanian '' is of someone who will try to mug me in a dark alley in berlin . 
  ` schland !,
