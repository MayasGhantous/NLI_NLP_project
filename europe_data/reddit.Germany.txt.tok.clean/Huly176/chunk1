it 's not like the people who live there now would sort of be against the idea , right ? 
  and who 'd there afterwards ? 
  or both \u00dc, 
  i must have missed that . 
  thanks . 
  it 's a really stupid question to begin with : how would i know if it mattered to me without knowing the person ? 
  which was , at the time , called [ * holy roman empire of the german nation * ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/heiliges_r%c3%b6misches_reich ) the english site of wikipedia never mentiones this , oddly . 
  we 're laughing to hard at your spelling , 
  maybe the the all the rich people went to luxembourg , so now you 're not an equal society ? 
  i do n't know . 
  german too . 
  and yes , i am aware that the next comment will mention nazis or ww2 . 
  it was a joke , but still . 
  it was n't really a pun on you , but more on the fact that british people on reddit very often make similar comparisons to the * daily mail * or the * sun * . 
  quality indexes are really crappy territory . 
  if you like the outcome , you believe the method . 
  if you do n't , you critisize everythingg in it . 
  and very often they are either 1 . a casual approach , more of an exercise in data collection and not better than a guess that is afterwards spread as if it were gospel . 
  2 . a complicated method that relies on many factors , but still has many shortcommings -- none of which are mentioned in any news report about them . 
  maybe the study creators nether thought about the bush-wiki-war . 
  is that a good thing to compare to , from a statistical point of view ? 
  hp0 : out of every comparison in quality or honourabless to the daily mail , the chance of a positive outcome for the compared object is  98 % . 
  i think this article overstates the facts available . 
  mr. weil claims he coordinated his speech with vw ( he is a supervisory board member , because his state owns 20 % of vw shares ) to not state incorrect facts . 
  [ article in german ] . 
  ( http://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/weil-vw-rede-105.html ) [ this is the manuscript his goverment published in response to the allegations . 
  most eddits marked are from his staff ( umarked ) . 
  some are by a lawyer ( ra drinkuth ) . 
  few eddits were wanted by vw , most of them were rejected ; parts about the internal investigation were changed ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/rede-weil-101.pdf ), 
  and especially not in nrw . 
  but hey , i live in cologne , i 'm used to construction going on forever . 
  but it has a flag !, 
  this ^ ^, 
  they did not not `` ban '' them at all . 
  the ruling was just about if the `` church '' of pasta would be allowed ( had a right to ) their sheduled masses beeing posted on a street sign on the town 's border , witch protestants and catholics do . 
  the court said no , because it believed they were not a reliion proper . 
  a tabloid that it is called `` fakt '' . 
  can someone please sue them for fraud ? 
  [ this i guess . 
  he 's stalin 's best buddy, 
  best decision by the swiss . 
  minecraft joke in 3 , 2 , 1 ... 
  gr\u00f6nland , people , is the real name . 
  which was kind of the point of the argument . 
  if you do n't do anything bad , nobody 's getting pissed . 
  italy too . 
  nobody told me yet , so i do n't know . . 
   sounds like something from the soviet union gdr . 
  yes , that makes sense . 
   this map is just sad there are some places ( french and spanish coastline , northern italy ) where it looks like a tourist correlation . 
  just a hint , 
  yup . 
  you wo n't get to see the dom without scuffolding for the next 100 years , so do n't be offended . 
  actually , it 's not that strange . 
  if you 're a religious muslim that is discriminated against and want to practice your faith in peace , you do n't go to that mosque if all the cameras are there . 
  or sweden vs france, 
  how many soldiers do they have ? 
  probably `` no data '' ... 
  basically same station : the station you see there is the setup around [ 1900 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:k%c3%b6lner_hauptbahnhof_um_1900.jpg ) , when the bridge crossing the rhine was not there yet . 
  if you look at it , it is sort of self-evident . 
  probably same for germany . 
  so i remembered that correctly . 
  i also think teenagers in austria have better access to cigarettes , right ? 
  i think the legal age is or was lower , but i 'm not sure . 
  do n't complain . 
  nobody calls you a nazi when you 're abroad , your country got lucky . 
  probably a translation of `` verniedlichen '' --  to make sth look smaller/cuter/child-like / harmless than it actually is . 
  i rather doubt that money was the problem in case of the bridges . 
  the life-cycle-checks were not done properly , so when they realised they had to repair , it was almost too late . 
  i do not think most people who have this stereotype have ever listened to a genuine conversation in german . 
  do n't you steal sterotypes on my country and take them away :(, 
  maybe austria and switzerland can sell you one o their mountains ? 
  they have lots of them . 
  solves all problems ... 
  run away as far as possible ? 
  australia agrees on the condition it can keep it 's own climate . 
  berlin is very small in comparison to germany as a whole . 
  but that has more to do with it 's history : it actually had a population of 4 million in the 1930ies -- until that war & wall thing happened . 
  berlin / germany : 3.5 / 82 : ~ 4.27 % that 's the way to do it ... 
  the rain economy in northern africa is not what it used to be, 
  now i know why all the dutch people are freaking out about winterberg . 
  i meant the political implication of the poster : that ee is at a disadvantage . 
  yes , right . 
  it 's just that i was commenting on the inequality claim above : you do not * necessarily live better in germany * than in poland because of the higher labour cost . 
  maybe add a `` per cost of living '' element into this ? 
  otherwise it is just bs, 
  [ hitler did not need a majority to become a dictator ... ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichstagswahlen_in_deutschland#ergebnisse_1919_bis_1933 ) and in the last election he was already in power and put pressure on the far left and social democrats . 
  he did n't win a majority , even though he `` cheatet '' . 
  lowest level of government : individual cities and counties / landkreise . 
  totalitarian . 
  the nazi regime basically wanted to control every part of society , they created a state-run organisation for everything . 
  ask napoleon , he knows . 
  is n't that right , mon-amie macron ? 
  the gun , operational time , crew accomodations ( + special purpose personnel ) and sensors are almost the same ? 
  i do n't think so ... 
  the german mod doing something properly ? 
  that would be unexpected ... 
  berlin to itself : \u201e i 'm special ! ``, 
  we have millions of them in germany !, 
  thought merkel 7 years ago about 2020 ...
