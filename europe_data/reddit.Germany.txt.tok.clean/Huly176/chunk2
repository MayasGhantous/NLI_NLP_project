  german law assumes a plane is like a ship in international waters ( if it 's german and above country x ) i.e. 
  subject to the laws of the country which flags it flies i think, 
  that surely explains it xd no , you are fine . 
  well , they can -- i 'm sure nato would be more pissed about turkey than germany . 
  the german goverment just thought / hoped that the erdogan regime did n't want to escalate this into a nato-crisis . 
  without atalanta , the atalanta-frigate is useless . 
  so where do we use them now ? 
  the lybian coast seems fine . 
  * what could possibly go wrong ? 
  if you see it at what it is : a helicopter to fight tanks ( at least the german version ) . 
  having more than 30 of these things might also be useful ... 
  they ca n't access them themselves . 
  they have to wait for mr. orange ' s permission first ( they are locked by the us ), 
  the best summary of august & onwards of 1914, 
  do n't worry . 
  we 'll conduct any mountain testing in your eastern nabour ( the larger one ) . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  it is also quite interesting to look at how these regions are drawn . 
  blue banana best banana . 
  you are talking about bild . 
  there also is the [ michel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutscher_michel ) , but he is mostly satire, 
  basically rust belt \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise . 
  or of [ hesse ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:flag_of_hesse.svg ) ? 
  why does everybody use the colours of the hanseatic league ? 
  in a * parc naturel * of all places !, 
  \u201e blitz `` as `` flash '' is also just a metaphor , so both ? 
  that is ridicoulusly stupid . 
  there really are these contracts in which the states gurantee the prison operator a certain amount of inmates , right ? 
  i only saw that on videos , it looked the same ( smaller , probably ) . 
  this is just like hooligans are not proper football fans , but are just in it for the punch, 
  it 's like the ecb has opened again . 
  same crowd , basically, 
  steinmeyer ? 
  i love how it just says '' * the * empire '' . 
  [ relevant `` news '' coverage by fox ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe3vxu9vxaq ), 
  hey , same here . 
  a bit earlier . 
  what do french people ( and prussians ) have against education ? 
  can confirm . 
  german road signs ( e.g. 
  on an autobahn ) feel friendly ( and a bit dull ) to me in comparison to other countries ' signs because they are what i grew up with . 
  the other ones also have a distinct feel to them . 
  the feel is traffic signs , right ? 
  they feel very different . 
  median vs. arithmetic again ? 
  not really . 
  the map does n't even include special treatment for catholics in thuringia and saxony , and also not the de-facto holiday that is carnival . 
  the hre was far more complex . 
  well ... 
  they got rid of the local dialects , so ... not really . 
  it would have been very difficult to reset the insurance , though . 
  and just changing the way all local industries have to work ? 
  not that of a great idea . 
  i do n't think they imagined these regulations to be still in place by 2017 , though . 
  https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichtexte.do?cidtexte=legitext000006069443&amp;datetexte=vig https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsland_elsa%c3%9f-lothringen#nachkriegszeit_in_frankreich ( german ) so , as a summary : the french laicit\u00e9 laws do not apply in alsace-lorraine to the same extent , were the german system of contracts with the churches was kept in place . 
  this also means it is possible to study religion in school . 
  the german workers ' insurance is still in place , as is the commerce law . 
  and the minimum wage is slightly smaller . 
  they do have some special rights . 
  i think the workers ' insurance was different for a long time there . 
  but i do n't know any specifics . 
  `` in europe '' . 
  yep . 
  technically , sunday is a feiertag aswell , but that but be ridiculous to include . 
  ( \u00dcberpicky grammar-nazi : singular form is : das land , the plural is die l\u00e4nder ), 
  the couples have a right to opt-in , no new partnerships allowed . 
  she voted against it , tho, 
  i overread that completely lol, 
  they legalise posession up to a certain amount and then give the states power to open consumer stations . 
  but that would be . . 
  is n't it ten years ? 
  no atmosphere , not possible ... only after the moon colony . 
  for any interested german speaker , [ here ] ( http://verfassungsblog.de/warum-das-grundgesetz-die-ehe-fuer-alle-verlangt/ ) is a discussion of art . 
  6 gg in that respect in german . 
  that is perfectly ok . 
  there are no aristrocratic habsburgs anymore that are always pissed about you . 
  oh , right . 
  i first also thought it might be a paper that obviosly made its stories up for entertainment and was just misunderstood . 
  you ca n't separate erdogan from his office in this time . 
  and germany has every right to not have a foreign head of state advertising his autocracy on its soil . 
  i think those were misunderstandings . 
  turkey did n't tell the local goverments that erdogan or one of his wanted to come . 
  they feared that that would draw a bigger crowd than what the facilities were made for . 
  so they said no . 
  one thing of course that guns may increase is the risk of a person getting angry with someone and grabbung a gun and ... 
  if there is no gun around , and you can only use a knife or something else , the victim 's chances of survival are much higher . 
  basically , it is important who owns a gun , not how many there are . 
  bundesgesetzblatt is where laws are published . 
  the \u201e bundesanzeiger `` is for goverment contracts that are signed or calls for bids to a federal goverment programme . 
  they always are . 
  the thing is : if you ignore your party too often in these debates , your party wo n't nominate you again as a candidate for parliament and it is really hard for an indipendant candidate to win in the german mixed system . 
  it 's a frigate for one main purpose : low-level engagement against very weak enemies ; with very long deployment time and land strike capability ( limited ) . 
  it dos n't even have a proper asuw capability . 
  i would n't say that 's a destroyer ... 
  i wonder if that also is how the verfassungsschutz works . 
  that would explain a lot ... 
  that is a problem a presidential democracy has , yes . 
  in a parliamentary system , it does n't work like that . 
  but let 's not make this into an argument about which system is better . 
  the reactionary force to the impact ?
