  and any safety rule that would come to mind a second after you start thinking about the affair of letting somebody jump of a bridge . 
  maybe tell her first how the system works . 
  the league of nations was a great idea that was very poorly put to work . 
  first they excluded germany and the soviet union , and the americans who 's idea it had been ( wilson ) nether bothered to join and they generally had the wrong attitude towards the idea . 
  nrw and the netherlands are on par when you compare population size . 
  so i could just say : but the ruhr area has a higher population density ... 
  are you that they were forced into those areas ? 
  i always though that they were forced more into the more densely populated areas in ( former ) western germany ? . 
  [ slightly less than a third ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruhrgebiet ) , according to wikipedia . 
  in germany it 's some people in the cdu that merkel can ' afford to loose . 
  the other type of partnership for germany is basically a marriage excluding adoption rights , so ... 
  if i remember correctly , foreign same-sex marriages are recognised in germany ( netherlands are a happy destination for that ) and [ schulz is pushing very hard for it at the moment ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/ehe-fuer-alle-113.html ) . 
  ( link in german ), 
  adding to the gdr problem , many of the eastern states ( mecklenburg-vorpommern , brandenburg , sachsen-anhalt and th\u00fcringen ) are very rural , so that hurts them as well because universities , bigger companies and so on are mostly in cities ... 
  [ nrw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_rhine-westphalia ) , the german state bordering belgium and the netherlands has a slightly higher population density than the netherlands ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_netherlands ) . 
  i thought that was later , when the ussr annexed eastern poland and expelled all the polish people there . 
  germany refrained from voting on it , actually . 
  brown is better as a colour for facism . 
  you can make better yokes abut them this way . 
  yes . 
  / utradeyourselfin `` ` [ this ] example from my homeland always comes to mind . 
  some other examples relating to poland `` ` bigthink.com/strange-maps/348-an-imperial-palimpsest-on-polands-electoral-map, 
  but what about russia ? 
  i always thought they were multi-ethnic , but they still have very nationalistic tendencies at times . 
  maybe it 's that the uk does not have land borders to anything except ireland ( least not forget , until 1997 that was rather brutal , too ), 
  that really is strange , because most of these areas ( lower silesia , pommerania ... ) were mostly inhabited by germans before 1945 . 
  i think both . 
  there were definetly poles living there , but i think there were also germans . 
  because of complicated german history with reformation , pre-wwii censuses are often a good way of seeing who reigned an are pre 1648 . 
  i was travelling from cologne to stuttgart ( via frankfurt ) on an ice once in the last five years . 
  i had to change trains at mannheim , but the connection train was about an hour and a half delayed . 
  why ? 
  db blamed it on a freight train accident in eastern france . 
  another problem for germany is that most of the high-speed lines are also used for other trains , which increases the delays if things go wrong . 
  liege has experience with slowing down invaders , you see ? 
  so they are already preparing for next time ? 
  maybe the swiss will lend us their perfect infrastructure so we can ... 
  i guess you mean school education . 
  in germany , this gets a bit more complicated because of the three-tiered school system . 
  the abitur is the certificate you get after graduating from a gymnasium ( a form of grammar school ) , which allows you to go to university . 
  other schools ' certificates are just referred to by the school type ( realschule or hauptschule ) and usually do not allow you to go to university . 
  your pronunciation is just weirder than that of bavarians . 
  is n't that the reverse-placebo-effect ? 
  you think you are in contact with something that makes you ill , so you feel ill . btw : really ? 
  because everytime i see dutch people in the alps , they are on skis or on a snowboard and are almost crashing into me at 100 km/h + . 
  that is clearly the equivalent to the netherland 's himalaya . 
  do not contradict my stereotypes about db with facts , pls . 
  i still want to moan all day ... 
  spa ? 
  as in top gear ? 
  the river area is [ joint luxembourg-german territory ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gemeinschaftliches_deutsch-luxemburgisches_hoheitsgebiet ) ( german language only ; sry ) so technically it was signed in both germany and luxembourg . 
  they do sometimes do checks up to 30 km inside the border . 
  and if you are within germany and ca n't get access to your passport / id card , thats a something that could get you a fine . 
  have read the next sentence ? 
  \u201e schengen eu countries have the possibility of adopting national rules obliging you to hold or carry papers and documents when you are present on their territory . ``, 
  that is not correct . 
  i 'm translating this link i posted above , which is \u00a7 8 of the german law implementing the schengen-area : _____________________________________________________ ( 1 ) citizens of the european union and their relatives are obliged to 1 . carry a passport or an accepted alternative document [ i.e. 
  an id-card , my addition ] upon crossing the border a ) with them b ) and show it to an [ ... ] official upon his request . 
  2 . posses a passport or accepted alternative document for the time of their stay [ ... ] __________________________________________________ eddit : reddit buggs a bit , the number before ( posses a passport [ ... ] ) should be a 2, 
  at least in germany you do have to carry one [ when you cross the border ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/freiz_gg_eu_2004/__8.html ) . 
  ( german language link only , sry , i did not find another one . ) . 
  if you stay in germany , you do not have to carry it around with you , but you have to posess one anyway . 
  still . 
  you still have to carry a id card when crossing a schengen-border , so it 's a kind of eu-passport . 
  not so much . 
  entries are only in german . 
  the issuing authority for example also eye color , birth place , and issuing authority, 
  the swiss are just more egalitarian ... [ / s ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kanton_appenzell_innerrhoden#geschichte ), 
  i believe there is a passport convention that passport have to be issued also in either english or french and another language . 
  and if it 's a trump voter , avoid the incident by about 10 miles . 
  i meant to say these are stereotypes from a german perspective . 
  being elected by about about ten powerfullprinces is not really that progressive . 
  i was joking . 
  probably meant extroverted . 
  the meaning is lost in translation . 
  the wording kind of sounds like the russian throne was a suicide-mission back then . 
  the german empereror was also ` elected ' . 
  by bribing the electors . 
  is n't that the austrian excuse ? 
  18th-century germany, 
  still stra\u00dfburg in german ... 
  is still ca n't get my head around the idiots saying stuff like `` german reich still exists , brd is a hoax/gmbh '' . 
  i mean , first of all : if the brd was not a state , how could it be gmbh ? 
  it would have to be incorporated in an ( in the minds of these people ) semi-state , austria , or switzerland . 
  many laws were re-adopted , yes . 
  that would have been possible even if the brd was a different entity from the german reich . 
  2017-turkey in a nutshell ? 
  imams do n't fall out of the sky , you see . 
  and there are training programmes for imams at german universities . 
  dutch is the language you speak if you try to make german sound as silly as possible . 
  the internet is also completely evil . 
  nevermind . 
  i guess it 's the movies that are at fault here . 
  they were payed to conduct a research . 
  that is not unusual ; surveys are expensive . 
  texts are completely different from being able to speak a language . 
  my french is terrible , but with a bit of ime i might understand an easy text . 
  dutch maybe a bit . 
  dutch people are among the best daf-learners in my experience . 
  daf = deutsch als fremdsprache = german as a foreign language,
