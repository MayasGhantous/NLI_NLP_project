some dude here commented , our drunk friend in the park was singing [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbu40ddvcte ) . 
  since i cant take balkan out of you , i 'd like you to put some balkan into me . 
  / nohomo what 's the song about ? 
  would you explain the song a bit to me , please ? 
  did you already know the german far-right said exactly that , `` non compatible '' about the polish in the 1930 's ? 
  and feared the `` slavisation '' of germany by the 1960 's ? 
  same thinking . 
  you just picked a different group of people to hate , but it is even the same xenophobic wording . 
  : would `` poles welcome '' also sound far-left to you ? 
  `` refugees welcome '' is n't far-left , you know ? 
  were n't it the canadians , who suffered the highest death rate on d-day ? 
  at omaha beach ? 
  glad to see you back on r/europe !, 
   conspiracy theorists and citing goldman sachs ? 
  i am not a `` conspiracy theorists '' and i do n't give a fucking fly about the two names of this bank . 
  both `` goldmann '' and `` sachs '' are both just ordinary german names to me . 
  i could n't care less about the religion of their founder 2 or 3 centuries ago . 
  what bugs me is , that big banks , as they have proven more than enough since 2008 do pretty fucked up shit to make more money . 
  that 's why i do n't trust these banks . 
   which part am i na\u00efve in ? 
   taxes : just because google and facebook and amazon also do it , tax evasion still is a major problem for every country . 
  employment :  uber is employing people who ... 
  the very same is true for every taxi company . 
  only that taxis offer better payment . 
  strategy : just like i had already said in [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4h0h3p/a_warning_to_tourists_visiting_portugal/d2mj4z2 ) uber does ** not ** give a fuck about anyone or any law , they only want to become a platform for mobility by 2020 , when the self-driving cars arrive . 
  i do n't know , what you have heard or thought about self-driving-cars or robo-taxis . 
  it 's * the * revolution of the next decade , and will dramatically change the way we understand mobility . 
  simply because robo-taxis are liberating us from having to purchase and own a car , we will give up on it entirely . 
  uber is just goldman sachs multi-billion dollar bet to bite a big chunk from that future market . 
  there are better ways to organize mobility in the future . 
   if you 're interested in this mobility-revolution , i can recommend r/selfdrivingcars . 
  they currently have an article about a latvian start-up aiming to make you old car self-driving . 
  i can not believe , how naive you are . 
  uber has no fucking interest in drivers , passengers or laws . 
  everything they are interested is the self-driving car . 
  autonomous driving will lead to a world where mobility becomes a service . 
  once we give up buying and owning cars , uber wants to become a multi-national distributor of mobility . 
  people should be aware of this . 
  no , they 're not trying to improve anyone 's commute , it is a billion dollar bet by goldman sachs to become * the * platform for mobility by 2020 . 
  in order to do so , they aggressively break the law everywhere , where they turn up . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i edited it . 
   mass sex assaults in cologne that was nr . 
  1 topic on the media for 2 months and still makes the news regularly . 
   crimes committed by migrants regular news coverage as well . 
  nice , then your question 's been answered . 
  you can now get back to topic , which is : ` the freedom of the press is threatened in poland ', 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4fmmrr/in_the_newly_released_2016_press_freedom_index/d2a6qxt ), 
   an you go publicly ( tv , newspaper article , etc ) , call islam evil and totalitarian of course , it happens all the time . 
  sold millions of his books and was in every talkshow , no problem . 
   if the court can overrule ` government ' it means the court is the real government !, 
  jesus , that 's laughably stupid . 
  :d you have no idea how courts and constitutions work , have you ? 
  this is the most stupid argument , i 've had in a long while . 
  edit : came back to answer this stupid question of yours :  quis custodiet ipsos custodes ? 
  the media . 
  which is in poland now also under control of pis . 
  `` mass censorship '' just does n't happen and wo n't happen . 
  unlike it might be the case in poland 's future . 
  you never know , what pis is up to do next . 
   you 're implicitly saying it 's ok to trample his rights wrong again , he had trampled the rights of others first , and most likely wo n't go to prison either . 
  the use of the word `` scum '' is n't the only felony , he committed . 
   how is the state of constitutional tribunal relevant to freedom of the speech ? 
  it 's the court to defend freedom against any threat . 
  including a government , that 's trying to reverse democracy and freedom `` putin-style '' . 
  germany `` mass censors '' and is still ahead of poland and the uk ? 
  interesting ...  just for calling immigrants ` scum ' . 
  bachmann could ( unlikely ) end in prison . 
  not only for the use of the word `` scum '' , but also his call to weapons , and a call for genocide against refugees , amongst other things . 
  would n't be his first time in prison ... ( drug dealing , robbery , violent crimes ), 
  the freedom of the press is threatened , and even worse the constitutional court is taken prisoner by your government . 
  do n't act like you would n't know that . 
  well , it 's still far away from what is happening in poland . 
  but when journalists ca n't do their work , because they 're violently attacked and threatened it has everything to do with freedom of press . 
  freedom is not only words on a piece of paper . 
  no , pegida-supporters attacking journalists violently is not only politically incorrect but also a felony everywhere in europe . 
  same goes for death threats against journalists committed by afd - and pegida-supporters . 
  the reason , why germany fell 4 places is mostly due to the right wingers of pegida and afd and their supporters . 
  that 's what the authors of this study stated . 
  the end of inquisition , women 's rights , every progress in sex morals up to today , the catholic church being one of the biggest land-owners , democracy itself etc , etc. ... the fight continues up to today in women 's right , rights for homosexuals and against childmolesters and pedophiles, 
   why not ? 
  it had a major influence on european history , culture , and science . 
  yep , and every progress had to be made against `` christianity '' . 
   germany legalising pimps and brothels pimping is illegal . 
  human trafficking is illegal . 
  having sex with a victim of human trafficking is illegal . 
  paid sex without condom is illegal . 
  even though swe and ger have taken totally different approaches to the legislation of prostitution , both led to similar improvements of the overall situation of women in the business . 
  if you keep the vast majority of you cynicism towards the irish , dutch and luxembourgish governments , you should be fine . 
  after the paris attacks , harder security measures were installed for a few weeks here in germany . 
  that led to the fact , now even more people were standing outside of the stadium queuing in front of some barriers . 
  one girl next to me joked : `` well , now the terrorists wo n't need to ruin our stadium . 
  they can just blow us up here in front of it ! '', 
  she was exactly right and we all agreed with her ... 
  it 's more about the context , the ` poem ' itself is rather poor . 
  i 'm trying to find some common ground here . 
   news and information usually get blown out of proportion , when they travel large distances . 
  of course this goes both ways . 
  in the same way as news about refugees in germany might be blown out of proportion in the us , news about donald trump get blown out of proportion in germany . 
  just one example .
