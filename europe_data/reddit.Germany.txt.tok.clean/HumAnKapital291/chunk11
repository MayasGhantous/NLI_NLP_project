  i 've been saying this for years now , but people would n't believe me ... 
  am not too surprised by that . 
  it was mentioned a few times , during the euro-drama . 
  there 's two reasons for germany 's median wealth being low : 1 . 
  ww2 , when everybody lost all their money in 1945 . 
  home ownership is low . 
  edit : median wealth is the stat , you 're looking for . 
  mean averaged data gets too spoiled by incredibly rich people . 
  like for instance susanne klatten and her family , who basically own bmw on their own , or the porsche/piech families , who own vw . 
  which is a clever thing to do . 
  a new car looses about half its ' value in the first 3 years . 
   overpaid man-children ow , that 's not unique to the uk !, 
  you learn to live with it ... 
  but i was baffled , when i found out , english football supporters do n't value the international competition ( cl or el ) as high as the premier league . 
  in most continental countries , these international competitions are seen as the climax your team can reach . 
  i 've heard similar things from latin american football supporters , when there was a discussion about it on r/soccer . 
  they can do with a mediocre season on domestic level , as long as their teams do good in the copa libertadores or copa sudamericana ( their continental club championships ) . 
  sometimes their teams are even willing to suffer in domestic leagues for the sake of a good international tournament . 
  ( like f.i. 
  send the first squad on a long flight for cl , and let the reserve team play the league ), 
  rugby is n't a thing here , no . 
  i do n't think there are any professional teams in germany . 
  but we might see `` peak football '' though , as it 's the same teams winning the same trophies every year . 
  i enjoyed watching rugby everytime i accidentally switched into a match of it on eurosport . 
  definitely looks like a great sport !, 
  : the uefa is the european football association , that hosts the champions league , the europa league and the european championship for national teams ( every 4 years ) . 
  just in case , you did n't know , 
  [ it is n't  ( http://dutchsoccersite.org/ronald-koeman-hero-in-rotterdam/ )  his role in oranje made his a true hero with most dutch fans secretly loving his `` wipe the ass gesture '' with thon 's jersey in 1988 . 
  this image also is n't photoshopped : [ click ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/images/heprodimagesfotos8512011111419421680-jpg/5832150/5-format43.jpg ), 
  in 1953 you had to pay 4.20 dm for one us-dollar . 
  in 1998 you had to pay 1.75 dm for one us-dollar . 
  [ source ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/312004/umfrage/wechselkurs-des-us-dollars-gegenueber-der-d-mark/ ) in 1960 you had to pay 11.70 dm for one pound sterling . 
  in 1998 you had to pay 2.91 dm for one pound sterling . 
  unlike the english , the dutch have won the tournament . 
  on german soil . 
  [ after ronald koeman had wiped his ass with the jersey of olaf thon . 
  unlike others with lions on their shirt ... 
   they 'll leave uefa they do it every 4 years in the quarter finals . 
   might actually win a trophy then still not . 
  they were eliminated in 2014 by costa rica . 
  when the competitors become too strong , you ban the competition, 
  i would go visit , finally meet my father . 
  millions of germans born in the '90s would do the same . 
  great gangsters !, 
  also possibly the best musicians the esc has ever seen . 
  and the most authentic . 
   maybe uk would get to open for us clear indication you 've never seen the esc other than that , you 're more than welcome to invade this event and put an end to this shitshow . 
  the one thing where america leads the world . 
  no , not films , not marketing either . 
  gangster rap !, 
  that 's the problem with brain-dead idiots like you . 
  you only think in extremes . 
  everyone who is against your fascism is a `` socialist '' . 
  your tiny , tiny , little brain then manages to connect `` venezuela '' to `` socialism '' . 
  you know , there 's something between your fascism and socialism . 
  it 's called `` the center '' . 
  but according to some of you braindead little whiners from r/t _ d , i already live in `` socialism '' : germany . 
  it 's fantastic . 
  one of the best countries on earth . 
  i really like it a lot . 
  and i wo n't allow it to be ruined by some americunts , who believe in fascism . 
  you 're a nazi piece of shit, 
  i really hope you visit a psychiatrist soon !, 
  if mlp wins the $ is history next week . 
  hedge funds would end it within days . 
  france ? 
  do n't let the rest of europe down , pleeease !, 
   do n't you people see the hipocrisy ? 
  turning a state into an authoritarian regime is somthing different than the normal democratic elections , they 've had for decades . 
  these were totally fine, 
  [ source : wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/verfassungsreferendum_in_der_t%c3%bcrkei_2017#wahlkampfauftritte ) maybe you can find something on the dutch or english wikipedia . 
  turkey does n't have mail voting . 
  experts say public international law ( v\u00f6lkerrecht in german ) would even forbid such a referendum on german soil . 
  i expect something similar would be true about the nl . 
  death penalty , especially in authoritarian regimes like turkey , is against international law . 
  would be interesting to hear the icj in den haag about it . 
  the maths behind it is quite simple . 
  he bought 60.000 options to a base price of 5.20 $ . 
  these options enable you to sell shares at 5.20 $ even if they 're worth less than that . 
  the maximum spread would be in case bvb falls to absolutely worthless 0.00 $ : 5.20 $ - 0.00 $ = 5.20 $ . 
  in this case he could buy for 0 $ , and sell them for 5.20 $ . 
  5.20 $ * 60.000 = 312.000 $ 312.000 $ - transaction fees = 276.000 $, 
   maybe he thought he could leave the country with the money before police would stop him ? 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  for a variety of reasons he appears incompetent in these deals . 
  he bought the options at the `` wrong '' stock exchange , frankfurt , whereas bvb-options are almost exclusively traded at stuttgart stock exchange . 
  [ the ard has a piece about it ] ( http://boerse.ard.de/aktien/bvb-attentaeter-wollte-an-der-boerse-reich-werden100.html ) according to this article his maximum profit would have been 276.000 euro . 
  not good enough to leave germany and live a `` happy life '' overseas ... 
   is that kind of option trading automated these days ? 
  parts of it are automated . 
  but they 're all overseen by ai 's . 
  bots keep track of turnover , spread and ammount of shares sold . 
  this is done to fight insider-deals and money laundering . 
  in this case the sale figures of bvb-put-options were so suspicious , the comdirect bank informed the police about it just one day after the bomb attack . 
  look at switzerland and greece , they 've also got sculptures .

  so as b\u00f6hmermann 's ` poem ' has caused quite a stir , and many here had asked for a translation , i just made one . 
  note : the important part is not the actual poem , but the context and what b\u00f6hmermann said in its ' further explanation . 
  for the guys of you able to understand german , here is the video in its ' full context ( starts at 10:50 min ) : [ jan b\u00f6hmermann , neo magazin royal 31.3.2016 uncut ] ( https://vimeo.com/161272558 ) ralf kabelka is jan b\u00f6hmermann 's sidekick : ** beginning : **  b\u00f6hmermann : welcome to germany 's comedy show nr .
