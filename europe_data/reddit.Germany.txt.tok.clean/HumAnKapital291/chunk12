  it 's us . 
  we do n't have anything to do with satire . 
  what our colleagues of [ extra3 did ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2e2yhjc_mc ) we 're not as thorough as them . 
  respect to them , big thing they made . 
  that 's a different league , like heute-show as-well . 
  i really , really like the heute-show . 
  they 're sooo brilliant . 
  when i heard rumors in the past , we were looking for their spot or anything olli welke hosts ... noooo , not at all olli !, 
  best wishes to you !, 
  [ blows kiss to camera ] i am suuuch a big fan of yours , i always watch your show for ... for ... errr ... \u201e inspiration `` . 
  also , the satire by extra3 almost started the third world war . 
  big applause for that !, 
  super-song . 
  and apparently in turkey every , even the smallest satire or comedy show is being watched . 
  so presumably , you also watch our show . 
  dear turks , hello , when you watch this here . 
  maybe we need to explain something to you ... ? 
  what our colleagues from extra3 did , was to make fun of your politics , mr. erdogan . 
  that 's legal in germany and europe through freedom of arts , freedom of media and freedom of speech . 
   kabelka : \u201e by article 5 ! ``  b\u00f6hmermann : article 5 of our constitution !, 
  that 's legal . 
  criticism of politicians is legal !, 
  you ca n't come here and tell the government to withdraw satire or delete it from the internet . 
  this is completely legal here . 
  and i really enjoyed , how civil society stood up this week . 
  beatrix von storch , who wanted me shot , if i remember correctly , two weeks ago , because of the [ `` fr\u00fchling for frauke '' - video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptkjfmypyj4 ) . 
  and now all of a sudden , she 's in first row , when it 's about to defend freedom of arts and speech . 
  everyone agrees , satire needs to be allowed . 
  mr. erdogan , but there are of course examples , that are n't legal . 
  on one side , there 's justified criticism , satire and fun , which is legal . 
  and on the other side there 's \u201e abusive criticism `` , which is illegal . 
  \u201e abusive criticism `` , that 's a juridical term . 
   kabelka : \u201e if you plainly insult people , defame people in personal regards , degrade people just to degrade them . ``  b\u00f6hmermann : to degrade someone is \u201e abusive criticism `` ? 
  and that 's illegal ? 
   kabelka : \u201e yes . ``  b\u00f6hmermann : did you understand that , mr. erdogan ? 
   kabelka : \u201e it can be prosecuted . ``  b\u00f6hmermann : it can even be prosecuted ? 
  and then video can be withdrawn from the internet ? 
   kabelka : \u201e yes , but only afterwards . ``  b\u00f6hmermann : it may be a bit complicated for you , mr. erdogan . 
  maybe we 'll explain it by a practical example . 
  i 've got this ` poem ' here , it 's named \u201e abusive criticism `` . 
  may we have a turkish styled version of a song by nena ? 
  and may we have a turkish flag in the background ? 
  fine !, 
  what comes next would be illegal ? 
   kabelka : \u201e would be illegal . ``  b\u00f6hmermann : this would be considered illegal . 
  the ` poem ' is named \u201e abusive criticism `` : \u201e sod-dumb , cowardly and hesitant / is erdogan the president / his boner smells like d\u00f6ner / even a pig 's fart smells finer / he 's the man who punches girls / while wearing a bloody rubber mask / things he loves the most / is shagging goats / and oppressing minorities this kind of criticism would be illegal !, 
  kicking kurds , beating up christians / while watching child porn / and in the evening instead of a nap / fellatio with a hundred sheep / erdogan is all things considered / a president with a tiny wang / i repeat this is an example of what would be illegal !, 
   kabelka : \u201e one would not be allowed to say that ``  b\u00f6hmermann : every turk can be heard whispering : / this dumb pig has got shrivel-balls / from ankara to istanbul / everyone knows this man is gay / perverted and zoophil / recep fritzl priklopil / his head as empty as his balls / the star guest on every gang-bang party / until his tiny wang starts to burn while having a piss / that 's reccep erdogan `` this is what would not be legal by freedom of arts !, 
  hey , do n't applaud !, 
  what would happen next ? 
   kabelka : \u201e it would be withdrawn from the mediathek , f.i. . ``  b\u00f6hmermann : so , erdogan would need to take a lawyer !? 
  joke is a great lawyer . 
   kabelka : \u201e yes , he 's the lawyer of the mayor of berlin and others . ``  b\u00f6hmermann : mr. erdogan , visit this lawyer , tell him you 've watched something you do n't like : \u201e abusive criticism `` . 
  then you 'd visit a court . 
  get a restraining order there . 
  then we 'd have a legal case . 
  does that become clear to you ? 
  i really enjoyed , as a citizen of germany , now after months of disputes and arguments , we finally had a consensus again . 
  when its ' about despots , when it comes to politicians , who go against freedom , like only despots do : erdogan , victor orban , beata shit-lo , beata shit-lo from the piss-party , the prime minister of great neighboring country poland , marine lepen from the [ acts like vomiting ] front national , pim fortuyn in the netherlands [ most likely confused him with geert wilders ] , hc strache from the fp\u00d6 . 
  they 're all authoritarian , nationalistic wannabe despots . 
  also frauke petry , here , of course . 
  all these are people , who more people should go against . 
  i really appreciate we resist these guys self-confidently . 
  who cuts the rights of other people , needs to get his own rights cut . 
  ** end ** he basically did something , like this comedian from the us : [ whitest kids u know : it 's illegal to say ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeqovygbbty&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  i was once trapped in a group of fietsers in nl . 
  i crossed the green lights , walked to the other side and suddenly 30 + cyclists drove past me , yelling `` let op ! '', 
  at me . 
  i could dodge them all, 
  buying organic/bio food at the supermarket on saturday , have them packed in cotton bags , so that you do n't have to use those * plastic * bags . 
  go there in your suv diesel, 
  yep , that 's my point . 
  noone uses this term outside of science , not even politicians . 
  `` angels\u00e4chsisch '' is in german a term to refer to the whole anglosphere . 
  `` anglosph\u00e4re '' would n't make sense . 
  mostly due to a current weakness of french governments . 
  i hope macron changes that . 
  europe needs a strong france . 
  convivial comes close, 
  [ dr. axel stoll ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbag63evzvo ) he earned a doctor 's degree in eastern germany , and became unemployed after reunification . 
  he was a literal neo-nazi conspiracy theorists . 
  `` aryans are from aldeberan and earth is just one of the aryan 's colonies . 
  the nazis had intergalactic space travel . '', 
  etc.pp . 
  [ his videos from a pub in berlin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_f_23ek3fg ) went viral on youtube . 
  tell him , he 's right geographically and absolutely wrong on culture , politics and history . 
  but i 'd probably just laugh at it, 
   can i avoid the genitive case in informal speech ? 
  do n't !, 
  it 's done by lower class people and is considered dumb and redneck-ish . 
  people will have a much higher opinion of you , when you use the correct genitive form . 
  it 's a special plus for non-native speakers . 
  the swiss central bank had pegged the swiss franc to the euro , since most of switzerland 's business takes place with the eurozone . 
  this became too expensive for the swiss cb , so they decided to let their currency float freely again in january 2013 . 
  [ here 's a chart of it . 
  click on `` 5 jahre '' = `` 5 years '' to see it ] ( http://www.finanzen.net/devisen/euro-schweizer_franken-kurs ), 
   no hatred to germans . 
  hmm , i 'm wondering ... 
  i got into more serious discussions about the `` evil germans '' with some belarus people on r/europe . 
  one particular conversation was so strange , i wondered if he was a putinbot .
