  the bible ( second book of moses ) and the torah refer to canaan/israel as '' [ a land flowing with milk and honey ] ( http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/a-land-flowing-with-milk-honey/ ) '' . 
  so it 's israel, 
  usa - west coast, 
  thank you, 
   how do you get into a relationship ? 
  we get drunk together . 
  ^ ^ / s small '' / s '' , because that 's , how it most of the times really w\u00f6rks . 
  we go out , to a bar or a club , get drunk , meet other people , talk and flirt , get their number , text them , and then go out together . 
  if you like each other , you 'll have sex . 
  if you also liked the sex , you 'll become exclusive partners . 
  american dating , at least from what i could grab , seems to be more formalized , 1st date this , 2nd date that . 
  then some baseball references , that i do n't understand . 
  in contrast to that european dating is like anarchy , and more dependant on alcohol . 
  americans though , from my understanding , seem to have more non-exclusive partnerships than us . 
  correct me , if i 'm wrong . 
  edit : i read in the s\u00fcddeutsche newspaper , that more than 60 % of all academics in the us , who successfully finish university , are female . 
  that 's 2/3 of all academics being female , which would lead to the fact , only half of the american female academics are able to find an `` equally educated '' male partner . 
  which means many girls in the us have to date downwards on the social ladder . 
  this of course is a massive game changer . 
  the s\u00fcddeutsche continued to argue , this disparity would make male academics a rare ressource . 
  as a result these men can now afford to date more than just one girl , as they do n't have to decide on one girl and stick with her . 
  that according to the sz were the difference between the us and europe . 
  even though girls/females have also become more successful educationwise in europe , the difference is n't as steep as it is in the us . 
  here in germany f.i. 
  55 % of academics are female . 
  as a result females are more likely to find a partner on their educational level , aka of equal social status . 
  eesti can into nordic ? 
  it 's a bit rare , yes . 
  maybe because the feeling is also rare, 
  it 's definitely not any good to see our closest ally run by a moronic buffoon . 
  ( sorry , but that 's my honest opinion about trump , and i know many , if not the majority of us-citizens think similarly ) european unity and solidarity are welcome , but i had prefered it had come from within the eu itself . 
  it 's just an ironic side note this new unity was pushed onto us from an `` anti-globalist '' nutjobber in the usa . 
  so , no * schadenfreude * for me , no . 
  a very theoretical questions indeed . 
  but i 'm definitely for as much cooperation as possible . 
  especially with countries of similar background . 
  no , i would n't mind . 
  i 'm very much in favor of a fair trade deal between the us and the eu . 
  if it 's done properly , we can only benefit from it . 
  this should be a more realistic goal for the future . 
  what impact did the refugee crisis have on them ? 
  4blocks watched the first two episodes and they were crazy good . 
  everything else is utterly dreadful . 
  just adding voter turn-over was below 50 % . 
  i met a couple of fellows , who told me : `` i live in germany , i do n't care , what happens down there ! '', 
  people with this approach sure left turkey behind . 
  spain !, 
  from a roman province , over ( re - ) conquista , to a world power , all the way back to a rather unspectecular , but happy and generally likeable eu country . 
  do n't forget franco 's fascist regime , that did * not * participate in ww2 . 
  has your country any negative stereotypes about spain ? 
  see . 
  i 've never heard anyone complain about spain . 
  [ i surrender to your joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzp1xc51kro ) sorry , wrong video . 
  meant to post this : [ i surrender to your joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwbnvkmrpkm ), 
  i hope so , yes, 
  it 's also very taboo . 
  people will shout at you , if you jaywalk,

  moos and m\u00e4use ( mice ) are both derived from yiddish meus/mous for money , kies ( gravel ) comes from yiddish kis ( wallet ) . 
  words like coal , ash or coke came into place between 1945 - 1949 , when there was no money . 
  people used burning materials as a backup currency for trade . 
  we derived `` pen\u00fcnzen '' from polish `` pieni\u0105dze '' , which had been derived from german `` pfennig '', 
  [ carl orff - o fortuna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxfsk0ogeg4 ), 
   i call them `` closet racists '' for that reason . 
  is there a difference between german , french and italian parts of switzerland ? 
  yep !, 
  according to top gear it 's [ southern ukraine ] ( https://youtu.be/njrlevsv1jw?t=13m26s ) . 
  and i 've heard from lorry drivers , belarus should be dreadful to drive through . 
  toll controls that last half a day , when you enter . 
  a large , almost empty country with not much more than crop fields , occasional , grey commieblocks and poverty . 
  i could n't double check , since almost no video material or news make it out of europe 's last serious dictatorship . 
  i knew one once . 
  he was an actual neo-nazi , regularly wearing a shirt that said : `` proud to be german '' printed above the [ reichskriegsflagge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichskriegsflagge ) from ww1 . 
  he 's a greek immigrant and became a salafist in recent years ... 
  because this sub is a cesspool of smugness and anti-americanism . 
  they just made fun of you for that . 
  that 's what caused the shitposts face the truth !, 
  that 's an entire genre , with kraftwerk its ' most well-known band . 
  one of the few songs , that i like is [ neu !, 
  - hallogallo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3vxdp7aby0 ) . 
  wow , what a wonderful ... * expierence * ... that must have been ... 
  although [ krautrock ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne7m63p820g ) was also the first thing , that came to my mind . 
  video is made by noisy , today 's sprockets of the us . 
  danke , obama !, 
  never has digging holes in dutch beaches been easier , than with my own private fighter jet !, 
  ` murica !, 
  liberated us twice ... from ourselves ... but anyways : ` murica there guys , i redeemed us a * working * fighter jet . 
  only * half * - kidding ? 
  now i 'm terrified . 
  yes . 
  also russia playing the mad man in ukraine and trying to influence people 's opinions via their propaghanda come to mind as border conflicts , that you do n't have in northern america . 
  edit : feel blessed for your geographical location on a sub-continent far away from anyone else . 
  it 's a strong geostrategical position to be in . 
  certainly better than europe 's . 
  well , i agree there 's far worse politicians . 
  and sigmar gabriel , her main contender for the next election , looks incapable of running his own party , not to speak of a major european country . 
  so there 's that . 
  then again , i do n't think a single nation could or should be too dominant in european politics . 
  i hope france gets well soon , so they can take a leading role again as well . 
  and i 've personally always wondered , why italian politicians are so absent from the european stage .
