  people need to be aware of that , i think . 
  having read many of the comments on / r/the _ donald about merkel `` hiding '' a black-red-gold flag reminded me of that observation , that i made quite often : news do n't travel well . 
  so here 's a bunch of pictures of the football parties in germany , taking place every two years , when team deutschland plays football/soccer at an international tournament : [ fanmeile deutschland worldcup ] ( https://www.google.de/search?biw=1680&amp;bih=911&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=fanmeile+deutschland+wm&amp;oq=fanmeile+deutschland+wm&amp;gs_l=img.3...24837.27138.0.27512.4.4.0.0.0.0.101.334.3j1.4.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.2.180.yx2jn6nrqwm ) see ? 
  certainly no lack of black-red-gold flags ... to sum that discussion up . 
  merkel 's gif was out of context , and no we are not * that * afraid of our own flag . 
   and news do n't travel well ( both ways ), 
  also find it a bit inappropriate ... 
  but hey , at least he was referring to the 9th of november instead of the 5th : [ november 9th in german history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_9_in_german_history ) revolution in 1848 , revolution in 1918 , hitler 's beer hall putsch in 1923 , first anti-semitic runs in 1938 , and the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 all took place on nov. 9th ... 
  yeah , something similar . 
  maybe a bit weirder even . 
  the `` deutschland gmbh '' , `` germany ltd. '' there are some people , who are honestly convinced the federal republic is just made up by the western allies after ww2 , and the reich would still continue to exist . 
  they sometimes refuse to pay taxes , traffic fines and even make their own passports . 
  cause clearly a self-made passport is more acceptable than an official one , is n't it !? 
  they do n't necessarily hate foreigners , there are also self-declared `` reichsdeutsche '' , who are very much in favor of immigration . 
  they just think the federal republic is a giant scam ... they honestly think it 's a gmbh , ltd. 
  yes , you 're right . 
  one qualified reply at least . 
  thank you . 
   staying below the public radar . 
  not true . 
  they were simply registered twice or more often . 
  a failure of bureaucracy . 
  thinking tens of thousands of people would cross several 1000km to stay in illegal underground is plainly stupid . 
  utterly stupid . 
  and what sounds like a bad thing in this article , is actually a good thing : [ zeit online : many were registered more than once ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-02/fluechtlinge-verschwunden-bamf-aufenthaltsort )  first things first : no , there are n't 143.000 gone missing . 
  they also did n't go into hiding or disappear into illegal underground . 
  the problem is n't with the refugees , but with german bureaucracy . 
  and it 's already been solved . 
  many people had been registered twice or even more often . 
  two conclusion : * the number of 1.1 mio . 
  refugees last year is actually lower * less people came to europe than we calculated in january, 
  ultra-capitalism beat you : * 1st : inner-london * f-ing-poorest : yorkshire & lincolnshire, 
  wait for self-driving cars , no need for taxis then . 
  in less than 10 years time , there wont be any taxis left . 
  uber might still be left , though . 
  reason ? 
  selfdriving-cars . 
  that 's the market uber is looking for , they do n't have any interest in taxis , and not even in their own drivers . 
  they just want to get known as a mobility service . 
  with the first truely self-driving cars , people will soon stop buying and owning cars , instead they 'll use them as a service . 
  the old ones are usually the most fancy ones , but noone names their children this way nowadays : * siegfried * - peace through victory * hildebrand * - burning sword in battle * gerhard * - the hard spear * sigrun * - victorious rune , * fem .

   i think if the uk votes to stay in the eu after our referendum we need to finally stop tip-toeing around the eu and start becoming a second major voice in the eu 's development to make sure germany does n't dominate it . 
  i 'd totally support all of that . 
  unfortunately cameron and hollande left the leading role to merkel , for different reasons . 
  merkel was somewhat pushed into that `` leader position '' . 
  the majority of germans were fine with handing over political power to france or britain . 
  so am i. europe can never be lead by one single country alone . 
  we citizens of europe need france ** and ** britain . 
  sarrazin is a paranoid idiot . 
  it 's all about marketing , i guess . 
  and the portuguese almost never make the news ... 
  i do want to talk about ww2 , i do n't mind a conversation about the war or the holocaust . 
  i 'm fine . 
  it 's just sometimes a bit ridiculous , how every conversation on the internet turns into a conversation about the nazis sooner or later . 
  [ godwin 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin's_law ), 
  a manual about how to assemble furnitures somehow turned into a discussion , which tank in ww2 was best ... oh , come on everybody . 
  the most glorious [ swedish submarine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasa_%28ship%29 ) is n't included in the list ? 
  at least * try * to stay reasonable , man . 
  eastern-europe is not the middle-east !, 
   we 'd be saying goodbye to other nations as well . 
  yeaaah , because that would improve your situation immensly , would n't it !? 
  101 % agreed . 
  yep . 
  how suprising !!!, 
  / s and not even true !, 
  the sauerland-group in germany were converts . 
  more angst-ridden whining from the east ?

  [ wikipedia 's list of countries by gdp per capita ( ppp ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) you 're right the gap between moldova and romania is way wider than between poland and romania . 
  my guess is that the map 's creator `` softened '' both extremes , since there are also quite steep differences within norway , that are n't visible in the map . 
  the gfk is known for being notoriously unscientific , anyways . 
  that 's not its ' purpose .

  what you just said is also a classic example of russian * whataboutism * and a reason why european people are distrustful towards russia . 
  the war in yugoslavia was necessary to stop the genocide there and fully backed by european politicians . 
  the war in afghanistan was against the taliban regime and against al-quaida . 
  but here stops our disagreement and start the similarities : i personally went on the streets to demonstrate against the war on iraq , knowing it would n't change a thing . 
  the name of george w ( anker ) bush is still a forbidden word in our house . 
  and i think you 're absolutely right the wars in libya and syria only made things worse . 
  especially the way the war in syria is carried out is in my opinion totally wrong . 
  it still does n't change the fact , that you can not start a war in europe without the agreement of european leaders . 
  ( like for instance to end a genocide ), 
   also , sanctions against russia if you 're talking of the sanctions against russia , that were to counter the russian aggression in eastern-ukraine , then you 're contradicting yourself . 
  because these sanctions were introduced by european leaders instead ( ! ), 
  of a nato-led counter-attack in ukraine . 
  against the will of the usa , btw , as the us had wanted to send arms and weapons to ukraine to help them fight the russian soldiers in eastern-ukraine . 
  seems like the eu is not dominated by the us . 
  you can not expect russia to start a war in europe and get away with it . 
  the way i see it , the reason why we did n't mourn over the russian plane brought down by isis , is exactly because you had brought the dutch plane down before that . 
  then your politicians brought a storm of ugly lies to cover the fact , it was the russian army behind the buk that shot down mh-17 . 
  you can not expect europeans to mourn over a russian plane , when the remembrance of an european one shot down by a russian buk in a war that russia started is still so fresh . 
  especially not when your politicians had so ugly and hurting lies to cover the russian military , instead of saying `` sorry '' even once .
