  edit : [ the way of the buk ] ( https://mh17.correctiv.org/mh17-hauptgeschichte-russian/ ), 
  nice trolling , mr. throw_away from our perspective even the american democrats are like rightists . 
  do n't get me started about the republicans , rednecks , or george w. bush . 
  enjoy donald trump !, 
  [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/17/paris-terror-attacks-french-police-launch-fresh-raids-overnight-live ) as far as it seems now , it has been a false alert . 
   there is not one nation which has integrated immigrants well in europe . 
  i live in a country that has more immigrants than the us or canada , btw . 
  yep , but that suspicious package had been inspected hours before the match and it was safe . 
  there 's something else , more concrete than just a suspicious bag laying around . 
  yeah . 
  and they get it broadcasted live on tv for maximum attention . 
  that 's what they want . 
  it 's the second time for me since friday to see it unfold live on tv . 
  hard to keep a clear head . 
  it might be just an unqualified opinion of mine : but if i were in france now , i 'd try to get out asap . 
  and i would personally mind large crowds . 
  since i am not in france , i do n't know , what 's going on there right now . 
  maybe it 's best to ask a police officer on what you should do next . 
  try to contact the police and ask them . 
  they possibly know best . 
  i hope you can continue to have a happy honeymoon and enjoy the rest of your stay in europe . 
   po ... st. obvisously you 're not as lazy as others , but still pretty lazy . 
  nope , nothing like that has happened . 
  there are `` erstaufnahmecenter '' like this all over germany , many in rural parts of the country . 
  no protests , no hunger strikes , no negativity so far . 
  some 20 percent of the refugees are from syria . 
  not all of them would go back to syria , once syria is safe . 
  others will become members of the german society , just like the refugees from former yugoslavia , who came here during the 90 's . 
  where ever they want to and can afford to live . 
  i do n't know the details about romanian politics , but there are general elections next year in romania . 
  maybe parliament would put an interim government in charge until those elections . 
   did you love this guy ? 
  the romanians on this sub mostly despise him . 
   was he accused of corruption ? 
  not only accused , but there is an actual trial against him . 
   was he a good leader ? 
  hardly a leader at all . 
  he spend the past months mostly abroad , as he faces legal charges in rom . 
  he was n't governing the country at all for a couple of months now . 
  they 're not staying there forever , but only as long as their applications for asylum are being processed . 
  approx - 3 months . 
  edit : then come the next refugees to this refugee-shelter . 
  english : the panther his vision , from the constantly passing bars , has grown so weary that it can not hold anything else . 
  it seems to him there are a thousand bars ; and behind the bars , no world . 
  as he paces in cramped circles , over and over , the movement of his powerful soft strides is like a ritual dance around a center in which a mighty will stands paralyzed . 
  only at times , the curtain of the pupils lifts , quietly -- . 
  an image enters in , rushes down through the tensed , arrested muscles , plunges into the heart and is gone . 
  see , you know so little about economics , you dont even recognize it . 
  there are , btw , 3 points , i made . 
  small businesses is just one of them . 
  do you find the other 2 ? 
  i also argued , like so many others have , that export-surpluses are not a good thing , that ** do n't ** benefit the german society . 
  you did n't understand that either . 
  maybe the comment was downvoted because / r/europe does n't believe in sdc . 
  / s but honestly , it 's become annoying here . 
  people like / u/the-knife come to such a discussion without basic knowledge of macro-economics , say their shit about 3 - $ - d\u00f6ner-l\u00e4den , because d\u00f6nerl\u00e4den are the only thing , they can think of , and then they reclaim they 're the clear-headed , and other people had `` no grip on reality '' . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  thanks mate . 
  nice talking to you . 
  when you say `` leftist site '' about `` die zeit '' , it says more about you than about die zeit : you 're right-wing . 
  happy pegida . 
  by improving gross domestic demand . 
  simple . 
  germany has been de-investing for more than a decade , export - ** surpluses ** are nothing but de-investments ( kapitalflucht ) . 
  since migrants are more likely to start a business , than the native population , it 'll help keep cash-flow within our country . 
  also the asylum seekers here are going to consume a great margin of their money , close to a 100 % of marginal propensity to consume ( marginale konsumquote ) . 
  that 's going to help against deflation . 
  i googled for an article to second my thought and found one on [ die zeit ] ( http://blog.zeit.de/herdentrieb/2015/10/22/fluchtlinge-nutzen-mehr-als-sie-kosten_8966 ) . 
  you do know , that speaking a language is not based on ethnicity , do n't you ? 
  o.o you 're a frenchman posting in english . 
  that should prove it for yourself . 
  two thoughts of mine on this indeed very interesting article : 1 . 
  the refugees will boost gross domestic demand in the short run . 
  while the official numbers of unemployed are still declining ( all-time low for re-united germany just now ) , an uplift in unemployment figures is to be expected for 2016 . 
  and also many refugees are about to start their own small businesses . 
  a caf\u00e8 , a restaurant or other easy-entry level businesses will pop-up . 
  therefore germany will get a bit less dependent on exports . 
  that 's exactly what we need right now . 
  for me and the majority of people it is out of the question , migration will help us in the long run . 
  the vw-scandal might be a warning shot at the right time . 
  the biggest threat to german economy is the self-driving car , not the refugees , not the emissions of diesel engines , but the self-driving cars ( sdc ) . 
  german economy very much depends on the car industry . 
  with companies such as google , apple , tesla or uber-pop working very hard to develop the sdc , they 're about to revolutionize a whole industry . 
  like the music industry , the porn industry or others have experienced before , the car market could completely change within the next decade . 
  from buying and owning a fuel-driven car , to just renting an electrical-driven car . 
  driving a car could become , what riding a horse is nowadays , a recreational hobby , not a necessity . 
  that 's by far the biggest concern huge companies like vw should have . 
  lol , when putin appears `` reasonable '' ... 
  [ i 've got so much to catch up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpxn2vxpmlc ), 
  take the last referendum about the ukraine-eu treaty as an example . 
  people voted against it just to `` stick the finger to the government '' ... 
  i 'd expect the same for any important referendum atm . 
  also take into account the nay-sayers are a highly motivated minority , whereas the quiet majority does n't care enough . 
  i expect a massive disinformation campaign against ceta and some news articles in favor of it . 
  very similar situation here in germany , only that we wo n't have a referendum thankfully . 
  it all depends on the green party here . 
  nope , too many idiots, 
  read the rest of the article !, 
  no , it did n't happen . 
  [ according to the police ] ( http://www.mdr.de/thueringen/ost-thueringen/ermittlungen-nach-suizid-fluechtling-schmoelln-100.html ) not a single police man , nor doctor , nor fire fighter heared any `` encouraging words '' .
