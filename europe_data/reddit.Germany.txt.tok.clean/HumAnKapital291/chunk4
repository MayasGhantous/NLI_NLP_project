  there 's only one witness , and she `` heard someone else mentioning someone else might have heard someone else say ` dann spring ' doch ' '' . 
  the head of the refugee shelter criticizes the media for their spin of the story . 
  errr ... no [ euro - pound chart ] ( http://www.xe.com/de/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=1y ), 
   i 'm probably saying something stupid . 
  economist here : no , you 're exactly right !, 
  a ) the money will go to legal business eventually b ) black labor and black markets * are * part of the gdp ( by estimation ) [ calculating european gdp - changing the scales ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21613321-how-revisions-will-soon-bulk-up-gdp-changing-scales ) [ sizing up black markets and red-light districts for g.d.p.

  what 's the meaning of `` belarus '' ? 
  i had thought , it were russian for `` white russia '' , never really thought about the name either ... 
  it 's `` wei\u00dfrussland '' in german as well , btw . 
  well , the ethnicity of the terrorist is all over the media as well, 
  sure , but that does n't change the fact , they had wanted this war just as much as any other major european power . 
  in case you do n't know the series yet : [ world war 1 - prelude to war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plb2vhkmbjsxmmg8xhey2k-0ap9sri_zx7 ), 
  well , the french were actually very much in favor of la grande guerre , since they wanted revenge for 1871 . 
  and since germany had become too powerful for their taste . 
  like every other major european power . 
  i think you mean it started when the archduke of austro-hungary got shot . 
  so the poor old ostrich died for nothing . 
  yeah , because germany caused ww1 , right ? 
  maybe we can cut off a bit of baja california and resettle you guys there . 
  i 've always wanted to see a ginger latina . 
  \u00e4\u00f6\u00fc\u00df ? 
   denmark has a similar apprenticeship system to germany , i 'd say . 
  yes , similar but there seem to be some differences as well :  nurses go to high school ( gymnasium ) and then to a university college that might be compared to your applied science universities . 
  only doctors go to university here . 
  nurses would attend `` berufsschulen '' ( job schools ) for 3.5 years while working on the job , like your craftmen do . 
  they never go to university . 
  this accounts for a wide variety of jobs . 
  most business men also do an apprenticeship . 
  nurses are just one example , that came to my mind . 
  it also applies to other jobs as well . 
  which is why i stated these numbers are not truely comparable . 
  it was n't meant to question one 's education system . 
  it 's just not as easy comparable as op 's map suggests . 
  might be true for other european education systems as well . 
  as britain and scandinavia do n't have any decent apprenticeships ( `` ausbildung '' ) their numbers are much higher than germany 's . 
  f.i. , if you want to become a nurse in scandinavia , you 'd go to a nursery school , which counts as tertiary education . 
  in germany and austria , you 'd do an `` ausbildung '' , which only qualifies as `` secondary education '' . 
  yep , world-class lobbyism ... oh , have you heard already , the eu commission knew about vw 's cheat device for years ... - . -, 
   also , if thats the case why would we go after vw and not toyota ? 
  yes , but seriously why did n't / do n't they ? 
  atm it seems like every carmaker that offers diesel engines , broke the rules similarly or even worse . 
  so why only vw ? 
  why not every other cheating car company as well ? 
   nobody cared . 
  i beg to differ !, 
  the protests against the war on iraq were actually the biggest protests ever in the western world and still hold the record today . 
  [ protests against the iraq war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_against_the_iraq_war ) [ views on the 2003 invasion of iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/views_on_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq ) [ opposition to the iraq war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opposition_to_the_iraq_war#opposition_in_european_countries ) edit : i am very unhappy the french-german alliance against the us and britain at the security council of the united nations failed . 
  but i am still proud on it ( btw , i was at one of these protest marches against the iraq war . 
  in germany alone a few million people joined these protest . 
  iirc the biggest single protest was in rome with about 1 million people on the streets opposed against the invasion . 
  i just do n't like the `` nobody cared '' statement , because actually millions of people cared a lot ), 
  you really think so ? 
  my local radio station had a photo go viral on facebook , it went viral before it was censored . 
  you could see a man and a woman . 
  the lady was bare breasted , the man said openly racist bullshit against turkish people . 
  the headline was `` one of the two guys violates facebook rules '' . 
  guess , why fucking facebook censored the photo , because of the pretty lady or the racist arsehole !, 
  i s l a m o p h o b i c s l a m o p h o b i c, 
  wtf ? 
  i ca n't say * anything * good about them , either ... 
  the afd started as an anti-euro party during the financial crisis , gaining a few percent here and there , then its ' founders were driven out of the party by some far-right careerists . 
  - before the euro '16 one of the party 's leaders ( alexander gauland ) said , he would n't want jerome boateng as his neighbour , because jerome is black . 
  - bernd h\u00f6cke ( another party leader ) said some truely , truely racist things about `` the sexuality of africans '' . 
  it sounded like copy-pasted directly from the nazis . 
  - pegida ( patriotic europeans against the islamization of the west ) is not officially linked to afd , but it 's the same `` interest group '' of utterly islamophobic people . 
  - their neo-liberal stance on the euro is still : no help/no money / no nothing for southern-european countries . 
  - of course they also have anti-semitic bullshit as well . 
  their party in the parliament in badem-w\u00fcrtemberg ( stuttgart ) broke about a fight of anti-semitics vs. non anti-semitics . 
  if you think , they 'd actually * name * it `` trade war '' , you 're a bit daft . 
  but the paper is full of quite open threats . 
   us department of state who has said such ? 
  sure : [ source ] ( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/documents/white-paper-state-aid.pdf ) that 's the exact paper by the `` u.s. department of the treasury '' with quite open threats towards the eu-commission . 
  because paying 0.005 % tax is a * totally * sensible thing ? 
  or because the americans threatened the eu with a trade war , in case we 'll ensure corporations pay taxes ? 
  the gini coefficient measures income equality . 
  latest numbers : belgium : 26.0 germany : 27.0 usa : 48.6 ( the lower , the more egalitarian ) minimum wage belgium : 9.10 $ minimum wage germany : 8.50 $ ( 8.84 $ 1.1.2017 ) like , i said , have all the `` excuses '' , you want , but you definitely would want better ones , if you try to convince other people . 
  if i had a guess , i 'd say , you 're from wallonia and listen a lot to what the french left is saying ? 
  have all the excuses you want ... oh , that hypocrisy, 
  per capita your trade surplus with the eu is * a lot higher * than germany 's . 
  edit : or in your kind words : you do * more * to destroy europe 's standard of living and economy to boost your exports momentarily . 
  way more than us , yep . 
  have a look at this chart , belgium !,

  so , which of the four is the president ? 
  [ good morning , monkey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toyuzwto068 ), 
  txh a lot . 
  i have no idea , how they could spiral their `` news stories '' so wildly out of control . 
   propaganda is used by europe effectively as well . 
  no doubt , yes . 
  could you share some insight about the new sex-related laws for minors in turkey ? 
  those that got portrayed as `` turkey allows child marriage '' here . 
  i read those headlines , but could n't be bothered to read the articles , 'cause i somehow knew it 's bullshit . 
  i doubt the turkish ( muslim ) part of cyprus , celebtrates the assumption of virgin mary . 
  i 'd say , it 's european countries not acknowledging the turkish part , and therefore giving stats for entire cyprus based on the greek part . 
  edit : correct guess [ public holidays in northern cyprus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_northern_cyprus ), 
  [ poe 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ), 
  nice , one more sub to downvote the americans . 
  we had had major economic reforms in 2004/05 , that worked as internal devaluation , and led to trade surpluses .
