  so we had to increase both employment and wages since then , also during the fiscal crisis . 
  since both ( employment and wages ) increased since ' 09 , we now have a balanced trade balance with the eurozone . 
  german economy since entering the eurozone has been countercyclical to the rest of the ez . 
  imho establashing the euro sent many shocks across european economies and everybody had/has to adjust to new equilibriums . 
  these shocks are easying off now everywhere . 
  germany just had its ' economic crisis a decade earlier , adjusted to it and therefore was well prepared for the financial crisis . 
  fyi : real wage growth = nominal wage growth - inflation, 
   current migration wave european immigrants or refugees ? 
  without knowing what ** exactly ** he said , i think he may have one or two points : 1 . 
  hungary does n't need * im * migration , maybe they can even benefit from * em * migration . 
  asylum-seekers * are * a burden to society . 
  i am completely fine with eu-migration though . 
  you guys are awesome . 
  this is what the eu is and should be about , bringing europe closer together . 
  eu-migration is just the most practical part of it and we should admire it . 
  here the news is completely different . 
  all the media say she was pregnant from him , he lost it and killed her . 
  do n't know about it , but that 's what 's being reported . 
  a brit here to explain the british numbers ? 
  i suspect many of you guys would live in ireland ? 
  or does an englishman in scotland also count in this `` statistic '' ? 
  there was a documentary on arte about rammstein and their success in the us just recently . 
  coming from eastern germany , they had a glorifying view of the us , out off touch with reality . 
  you could say they had an unrealisticly * positive * view . 
  when they toured the usa in 2001 , they were shocked by the us ' reaction on 9/11 . 
  this led the band to cancel the tour , turn their back to the us and tour the rest of the world instead . 
  both songs `` amerika '' and `` moskau '' are from that period . 
  safe to say , they have since then made their peace with and found back their initial love for the us . 
  but from a more realistic point of view . 
  they became the first non-english-speaking band to sell out madison square garden ( it was sold out within 20 minutes ) .

   `` if it were clever '' i blame false english . 
  the guys who wrote this article are n't native speakers . 
  it has been corrected in the meantime to `` if it ** is ** clever '' . 
  the article is also available in german and there it has always been : `` wenn gro\u00dfbritannien klug ist '' = `` when great britain is clever '' . 
  `` if gb were clever '' in german would be `` falls gb clever w\u00e4re '' .

  there 's insurances specializing in such deals . 
  so in case poland advances to the quarter finals , the refunds are split between media markt and their insurance company .

  [ here 's a suburb from china , ] ( http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/kurioses/article113120394/china-bringt-mit-reihenhaeusern-frauen-an-den-mann.html ) in case you find your place 's suburbs too monotonous . 
  we won a point !, 
  yes !, 
  brilliant !, 
   pzh 2000 yes . 
  good luck on thursday !, 
  and you thought huntelaar were schalke 's biggest gun , huh ? 
   yeah man , those schalke fans are out of control . 
  my sympathies !, 
  yep , you 're possibly right . 
  these 20 guys are involved in a very similar thing . 
  the turkish administration had handed over a list of a few hundred names related to `` the coup and/or terrorism '' to the german delegation at the munich security conference . 
  the turkish government had tried to convince the german officials , g\u00fclenists were behind the coup . 
  but a few weeks ago the bnd openly stated , they 're not at all convinced g\u00fclen was behind the attempted coup . 
  which is quite a thing , after months of co-operation on all levels , the turkish could not convince the german officials of their claim `` g\u00fclenists did the coup '' . 
  that 's possibly why this list backfired . 
  and now germany goes against the people , who made it . 
  currently germany is investigating against at least 20 turkish spies in germany . 
  i guess there are far more than those 20 guys ... 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  i knew , you would n't fight the us . 
   well done !, 
  wow , would have been truely nice !, 
  we also ran out of time in the end ... what happened when after the us-flag was painted black and you guys had entered it ? 
  did you fight against ` murica or handed it back to them ? 
  i can see there 's now a heart between you two . 
  well , we tried to place it on our own canvas , below the world cup ... we failed , now it is '' ? 
  ger , bel and fra did n't want to expand further on the last day . 
  there were some guys on our discord , who wanted to claim more terrority , but we wanted to let other , smaller groups have their pixelart as well . 
  the colleges to the left of germany would have been an easy target . 
  the baguette got moved , not removed . 
  it 's now lying next to the ( italian ) wine . 
  it got moved so france and spain could clink glasses of red wine and champagne . 
  also props to the cheeky italians , who kept painting an italian flag into france 's wine bottle . 
  your flag is magnificient !, 
  i also like to add , it definitely was n't r/de , who kept spamming 7:1 on your flag . 
  i do n't know who it did , but not us . 
  that 's just the hippies .

  where do the spanish organize ? 
  you talk like you were some expert , but you do n't even know , sweden 's not in the eurozone . 
  poor effort . 
  i do n't think `` leader of the free world '' is a term we europeans should use . 
  it 's an americanism , clearly . 
  and we should leave it there . 
  a lot of the power that came towards merkel is due to france 's unfortunate situation and president hollande 's poor performance . 
  once they get a new president , a lot of power within the eu would move back to france . 
  and i welcome it . 
  leader of the free world ? 
  at best until september , when martin schulz becomes our next chancellor . 
  on the other hand , france has their elections already in may . 
  exactly , we do n't even want to be the leader of the eu . 
  time for france to retake their hugely important role within europe . 
  it was me . 
  i made that hole !, 
  no , but a medical attestation of `` paranoid schizophrenia '' and `` no indications of political or religiously motivated motives '' . 
  they 're still wrong and misleading !,
