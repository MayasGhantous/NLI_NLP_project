  symptomatic !, 
  [ police arrested one suspect . 
  they said , he 's mentally ill . from `` former yugoslavia '' . 
  ] ( http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/13248/3581306 ) p.s. 
  this is a perfect example of how news stirr out of control . 
  itt : people speculating about the motives and the ethnicity of the man were all wrong . 
  well , you started being retarded, 
  i see . 
  thanks, 
  the question that 's going to be asked in the referendum . 
  how exactly is it going to be phrased ? 
  do you know the exact phrase already ? 
  it 's an issue , as you can manipulate referendums in your favour by the choice of words . 
  because she does n't have any influence on these voters . 
  is there any information , how exactly the question will be phrased ? 
  could you * please * stop that unbearable chauvinism ? 
  am a rhinelander , we hated the prussians just as much as you guys did, 
  argentina was amongst the richest countries on earth in the early 20th century . 
   the report 's authors singled out places such as serbia , croatia and romania -- all either recent additions to the eu or in the process of joining -- as examples of countries that have made enormous progress over the past decade . 
  this is , they argue , largely down to eu policies . 
   `` there is clear evidence that eu policies and governance standards drive real improvements in critical areas related to the well-being of citizens . '' just in case you were in doubt about the eu ... 
  england 's the most germanophobic country on earth, 
  and most of your wins are  50 years old ... 
  not sure about that , but since our economy is also doing very well ( unemployment on an all-time low since reunification ) , i doubt this is going to have a significant impact on voter 's decisions . 
   if it would impact domestic politics in europe , what parties would it help ? 
  that might help spd 's schulz , one of his points against merkel is that she screwed the european economy with her austerity programm . 
  same , i was n't complaining :d, 
  is this a game now ? 
  the community comes up with new shitposts untill the mods ban them ? 
  some kind of hide and seek ? 
  anyways , shout-out to my fellow europeans . 
  we 're living in blessed times , where our biggest problem are the nazimods banning our shitposts . 
  blessed times of not having a single topic for everyone to go mad about . 
  for the first time in years . 
  nice !, 
  c'mon , it 's not the first news article , you ever read in your life, 
  yeah , because it 's `` hate '' when you debunk a false story ... / s, 
  nah , let 's not overdo things , but stay civil instead, 
  kek it 's definitely a fake story about german soldiers in lithuania . 
  who should have an interest in such lies other than russia ? 
  my utmost interest though is to make r/europe ( especially the lithuanians ) aware of anti-german , anti-nato propaghanda by * cough * ... someone ... * cough *, 
  so that everyone loses ? 
  it 's the same guy , according [ to this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/itsgreateu/status/827530248052998145 ), 
  thank you for clearing it up !, 
   and plus , they can also mean different things depending on where you are . 
  ha , i thought so , that 's what i meant with dialects . 
  truely interesting, 
  i always wondered , if you 'd have to learn those signs with the actual language !? 
  also , are there dialects in arm-waving italian ? 
  low-german language without a throat disease . 
  it 's just that you constantly chew on `` royal dansk '' cookies and ca n't be bothered to swallow them before you speak . 
  very `` full-mouthed '', 
  nah , dutch is a nice language . 
  it 's just unfortunate every dutch speaker suffers from throat cancer, 
  i had thought texas second ? 
  anyways , good job uniting europe against a common enemy !, 
  still waiting for u/executivemonkey 's expertise here, 
   what exactly he said to our beloved turkish gnome that he got sued for it ? 
  i made a translation here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ebe9p/what_b%c3%b6hmermann_said_english_translation/ the joke is quite elaborate . 
  the actual things he said are n't , in any possible way . 
  the context makes it clever , though . 
  he tried to explain the difference between satire and hate speech by delivering hate speech in quotes . 
  ceta is going to change that . 
  expect more affordable maple syrup soon . 
  he did . 
  kinda shows , how idiotic afd voters are , respectively , how much they felt left alone by the establishment . 
   president of the ~ ~ eu commission ~ ~ european parliament ftfy, 
  yep !, 
  so much this . 
  also , i think schulz is more charismatic than many other german politicians . 
   would you really vote for this guy ? 
  that 's only one very good reason to vote for schulz . 
  smells like a bot ... is austria 's most successful twitter-account a bot ? 
  just like the eu paid more money to poor districts in england , than the uk did . 
  confirms my observation , dutch girls are more fond of colorful make-up than german girls . 
  also , the irish girl looks 110 % irish to me . 
  inferiority complex, 
  maybe there was less incentive for remainers to cast their votes , since most forecasts had seen remain leading . 
  whereas the leave-voters were very dedicated indeed . 
   we risk to be marginalised hmm , i seriously do n't think so . 
  i 'd expect italy 's influence will take a huge step forward , if you do n't vote too anti-eu in your next elections . 
  i 've always wondered , why the italians were so absent from the european stage . 
  i am positive italy is going to have a lot more influence , as soon as the brits pull their article 50 . 
  [ mh17 ] ( https://mh17.correctiv.org/english/ ), 
  look for uk 's other name : gb, 
  nope, 
  are there any news in english or german ? 
  thank you in advance !, 
  here in germany , this `` other type of partnership '' result in : - homosexual not able to adopt children - homosexuals not able to benefit from the same tax advantages as heterosexuals, 
   adoption and marriage should only be between traditional heterosexual couples why ? 
  i know homosexual couples , who 'd make great parents . 
  i know heterosexual couples , who are terrible parents . 
  if homos were allowed to adopt children , we would have less children in growing up public shelters . 
  and if the process of adoption makes sure * good * parents adopt children , everybody would be better off . 
  i am politely asking here : why does n't anyone in gb care about income inequality ? 
  we 've had quite a series of posts on r/europe about inequality in the uk , even one that related to the brexit decision . 
  and you guys seem very at ease with inequality . 
  whereas the uk looks like a `` winner takes all '' society to me , that 's increasingly getting off track . 
  especially if you take brexit and your concerns about migration lately into account . 
  just trying to figure it out .
