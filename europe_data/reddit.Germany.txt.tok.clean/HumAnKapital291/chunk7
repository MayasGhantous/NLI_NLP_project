  which means anyone outside london , i guess . 
  well , that 's horrible to hear . 
  i had pkk and isis on my list . 
  but not al-nusra nor g\u00fclen . 
  my sympathies , and stay safe !, 
  which organizations are being discussed ? 
  somebody should tell them pkk is illegal germany as well , because it 's a terrorist group !? 
  anyway , stay safe and secure !, 
   suppression of all the migrant crime stories in europe ? 
  which ones ? 
  well , * sold * it , because the falcons in the white house wanted to use poor saddam against iran , which went to shit , after the cia ... 
  i just want to point out interventionism is n't a great concept . 
  it may be the the only point from the orange one 's agenda , that i embrace : not to use the military as often 1 . 
  non-interventionalism does n't necessarily mean `` isolation '' , there 's still the u.n. 
  f.i. , that could be useful . 
  diplomacy knows a thousand ways and it 's working . 
  not depending on the us-military for our own safety , could be truely benefitial for europe in the long run . 
  a bit of pressure on the eu could help just as well as the brits out . 
  i think someone should tell that orange buffoon , steps like these may take some years time or they 'll become truely dangerous . 
  to answer your initial question about the `` kuwaitis '' : do n't promote war as a matter of politics in the first place . 
  by not giving weapons to the guy , who then invades kuwait . 
  pretty fucking simple, 
  sure , just go to the bayarea, 
  no wildfires , no poor people ? 
  must be sf then, 
  you 're a massive idiot , are n't you, 
  the word liberal also has a broader meaning , which would combine democracy , capitalism , human rights and individualism into one . 
  according to this definition almost all western parties are liberal parties ( as opposed to socialist/communist and fascist ones ) . 
  the narrower definition of `` liberalism '' is center-right for most european countries and left-wing for the us . 
  i also confuse these third world countries, 
  you 're wrong, 
  proud on your alcoholism ? 
  finland, 
  age difference is the same as between donald and melania, 
  great !, 
  i 'll side with the dutch then . 
  finally my best chance to get rid of northerners , southereners and easterners . 
  that 's why i put `` our '' in quotation marks and an / s at the end of the sentence, 
  yes . 
  [ fluent with a very rare accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbcbqhev6jo&amp;t=461s ), 
  when `` our '' best looking politicians are abroad ... / s i hope , his presidency is going successful . 
  you guys deserve it , 
  we had a population census in 2011 , that showed us our statistics were wrong . 
  overestimated our population by 1.6 mio . 
  it was about the referendum . 
  yeah , they definitely had a reason to fight . 
  what was the topic of this ... err ... debate ? 
  edit : found it . 
  it was about the referendum . 
  fun fact on german taxes : kaiser wilhelm ii . 
  had introduced a tax on sparkling wine to finance the navy in ww 1 . 
  we still pay that tax ... 
  most oil companies have contracts with their petrol station that make price increases * mandatory * , while price decreases are * optional * . 
  by that they make sure to have constantly increasing prices over time . 
  agenda ... why are the netherlands also red ? 
  i guess the map refers to legally binding public holidays on specific dates . 
  [ there was n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_minimum_annual_leave_by_country#countries )  european union legislation mandates that all 28 member states must by law grant all employees a minimum of 4 weeks ( a total of 28 calendar days ) of paid vacation, 
  public holidays ! = annual leave  european union legislation mandates that all 28 member states must by law grant all employees a minimum of 4 weeks ( a total of 28 calendar days ) of paid vacation . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_minimum_annual_leave_by_country#countries ) of course you can have more than that . 
  yep , but she did n't expect a vote before the elections . 
  spd caught her once martin schulz pushed for it . 
   on the other hand , according to the experts of the almaz-antei concern and ** objective control given by the russian military ** lol, 
  ah yes , good info !, 
  are homosexual men allowed to donate blood ? 
  great rant 5/7, 
  one thing of many , yes . 
  next stop cannabis legalization, 
   is this merely a formality yes . 
  president steinmeier ( spd , former foreign minister ) already said , he 's in favor of gay marriage . 
  also it was his party , that made the final move for the new legaslation . 
  that 's what you have to endure , when you 're stuck with a conservative leader since 2005 . 
  quoting myself from ** 2 days ** ago :  tl ; dr : martin schulz : we will push through marriage equality in germany . 
  this week . 
   the german parliament has had a majority in favour of gay marriage for quite some years now . 
  merkel 's cdu/csu was the only party opposed to it . 
  spd did n't want to push for gay marriage as this would have broken the coalition government . 
  over the past few weeks , every possible coalition partner for merkel made gay marriage a mandatory condition for a new coalition after septembers general election . 
  merkel send some positive signals yesterday towards a `` marriage for everyone '' . 
   spd 's martin schulz now really makes the push for a legalization of gay marriage * this week * with the votes of the left-party , the green party and his own spd . 
   this is quite big news, 
  haha , yes you 're right . 
  i was hoping someone would play alongside the joke with me . 
  something like : `` why does it matter ? 
  it 's in five years !? '', 
  `` we 're going to vote on wi-fi hotspots in the morning '', 
  according to bild 73 of 309 cdu/csu ` ler voted yes . 
  adoption and partners are now allowed to change their names, 
  one mandate is vacant, 
   legalizing dope will be next ... in 5years morning or afternoon ? 
   another thing is less and less certainity about not being left in the cold when it comes to putin . 
  we wo n't let you down , poland !, 
  i think my country has something to make up for regarding poland . 
  at least we owe you security and prosperity . 
    have a tendency to want to boss us around if you 're refering to the threats by the eu towards the v4 for not taking in refugees , i 'm with you . 
  it 's a stupid idea . 
  i hope they 'll see , how counterproductive this plan is . 
  if you 're refering to pressure on hungary and orban : the eu should n't allow this level of anti-democratic leadership . 
  i hope pis does n't want to follow orban 's lead . 
   you should call half of germany eastern europe to be fair with that yes , i do that occassionally . 
  i replied to a different guy , i can see a divide between western - and eastern-germany as well .
