  i promise to be more sensitive about central europe in the future . 
   btw . 
  the topic is more related to trusting some companies , not people then there is no real difference between us . 
  i trust the food industry in exactly one regard : they 'll do anything for money . 
  reminds me how nestl\u00e9 lobbied for the privatization of water in germany a few years ago . 
  says a lot about them . 
  germany = / = eu just get that in your head . 
  right , that 's why i was * the only * one in this thread asking seriously about their concerns with western-europe . 
  makes sense ... you also failed to address * any * of my points ... 
  i get it : i 'm the eternal nazi, 
  i was asking for mistrust in western-europe , not germany . 
  i get there will always be a nazi-reference to anything someone with a black-red-golden flair says , but it 's become a bit tiring after years and it 's not a constructive conversation either , since western-europe and the eu = / = germany . 
  agreed , but it was even worse in the east ... and no sane person would argue germany had n't changed a lot since then . 
   as narrative by western media and western politicians it 's definitely becoming better . 
  there 's the occasional news article citing rom as a positive example . 
  and as you might have guessed , gypsies still give you a bad name ...  it is n't politically incorrect to pick on easterners unfortunately , i have to agree with you , there 's some bigot idiosyncrasies , which became especially obvious during the refugee crisis, 
  you 're a nutjob . 
  seen better, 
  yeah , exactly what i had thought . 
  then again , i can see some clear divide between east and west . 
  even within my own country . 
  any map on both opinions and hard facts shows a clear divide between eastern - and western germany . 
  i can fully understand , you 'd want to get rid of this `` stigma '' of having lived behind the iron courtain for half a century though . 
  is this also the explanation , why your northern baltic brother wants to be seen as `` nordic '' ? 
  well , regarding romania and bulgaria , i can definitely see where you are coming from . 
  when you entered the eu the media reports sounded like they 're about 3rd world countries . 
  openly questioning your countries ' ability to be a member of the eu . 
  i 'm happy to say the media reports have become a lot better . 
  when i read about romania , it 's usually about your fight against corruption . 
  this sub made me personally change my mind on romania though . 
  from `` fairly negative '' to `` overly positive '' . 
  france and germany had more wars than poland and germany , and we 're rather good allies now . 
  definitely no mistrust there . 
  poland and germany have been working on their relations since [ december 1970 ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_laba_uxfyb8/tpwoxbrvogi/aaaaaaaav-k/vj5sl0upjzg/s1600/brandt+kniefall.jpg ) . 
  germany has become a completely different country since ' 45 , as you know . 
  even when there is anti-german sentiment in poland , which i can understand , it fails to explain , why polish people would mistrust all of western-europe , including the eu itself . 
  as the eu is the one peace-building project to end all wars in europe . 
  why is nobody talking about the real topic of the article :  mistrust of the west i think , that 's an increasing problem and you find evidence for mistrust in this very thread here . 
  let 's talk about why ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ central europeans do n't trust us westerners . 
  i 'll start : what 's so bad and `` racist '' about the term `` eastern europe '' ? 
  it seemed so ridiculous , i thought , you were joking , yes . 
  lol, 
  you 're a nationalist ? 
  or posing as one ? 
  flair does n't check out did i mention , most of the job in ww2 was done by the russians ? 
  well done !, 
  you are ? 
  great , congrats !, 
  just here to remind you , your u21 lost to germany in the semi-finals yesterday . 
  in a penalty shoot-out . 
  so yeah , some things stay the same , even after brexit . 
  quoting myself from yesterday :  tl ; dr : martin schulz : we will push through marriage equality in germany . 
  this week . 
   the german parliament has had a majority in favour of gay marriage for quite some years now . 
  merkel 's cdu/csu was the only party opposed to it . 
  spd did n't want to push for gay marriage as this would have broken the coalition government . 
  over the past few weeks , every possible coalition partner for merkel made gay marriage a mandatory condition for a new coalition after septembers general election . 
  merkel send some positive signals yesterday towards a `` marriage for everyone '' . 
   spd 's martin schulz now really makes the push for a legalization of gay marriage this week with the votes of the left-party , the green party and his own spd . 
  makes sense, 
  would want to see the statistics for u30, 
  yes , i understood that perfectly fine , yes, 
  you do n't like schulz , i get it , but what 's your point anyways ? 
  yeah , it 's weird , is n't it ? 
  is that the reason , why english men are rather short ? 
  `` adopting '' your own children is n't really adopting, 
  he did n't , he just said they 're godawful, 
  nope , they 're not . 
  no right to adopt children , f.i. 
  because `` ordnung muss sein '' , whether it makes sense or not ... / s, 
  just today a new law passed the parliament , which makes public wi-fi truely free and legal . 
  the old law was a major obstacle towards free wi-fi , and was revised * three * times . 
  just today the new bill is finally the solution we needed . 
  the grand coalition had been working on it for more than a year . 
  today was a good day !, 
  the 20th century from 1914 - 1989 does n't check out, 
  i ca n't find it atm , but there were polls saying the majority of the german society is in favor of `` marriage for everyone '' . 
  then there are a couple of people , who do n't care , and only a small number of people * opposed * to it . 
  and as others have already pointed out , these are not the kind of people , who 'd rally on the streets . 
  til austria is our siamese twin you 're welcome , i guess, 
  this is the non-sense you have to endure , when you 're stuck with a conservative politician since ' 05 . 
  quite surprising to see , how fast things happen , when you catch merkel off guard . 
  it could possibly just take some days from now . 
  tl ; dr : [ martin schulz : we will push through marriage equality in germany .

  this is quite big news, 
  seen the posts , you 're reffering to ... yeah , i think i understand your point . 
  there 's only one thing , that 'll help : forgiveness, 
  yeah , the german subreddits are very `` balkanized '' . 
  afaik de_iama is the only geodefault for germany . 
  not 100 % sure if it 's also a default in austria or switzerland , though . 
  paging u/sillymaniac and u/sdfghs to shed some light with us . 
  asked for bosnians , `` here '' was the answer , flairs up as serbian ... 
  the entire concept of balkan is confusing .
