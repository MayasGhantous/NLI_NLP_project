  all of it :d, 
  where in the black forrest do you live ? 
  til dinosaurs are human, 
  will balkan ever stop being confusing ? 
  i 'm just here to say the numbers for germany are wrong . 
  op used r/de instead of r/de _ iama . 
  r/de is a non-default sub for germany , austria and switzerland . 
  r/de _ iama is the geo-default for germany . 
  it has 291.976 subs , instead of 62.890 . 
  so the corrected stats look like this : 291.976 / 80.636.124 = 0,362 % 3.62 per 1000 that would put germany inbetween malta and greece on 17th . 
  now , flair up, 
  i just noticed it in this thread ? 
  where are the bosnians of r/europe ? 
  i see croatian and serbian flairs here , but no bosnian flair . 
  where are they ? 
  yes , that 's exactly what the vatican says . 
  estonia looks like a [ dead kennedys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dead_kennedys ) cover band . 
   saltire at first , i thought this would be `` salty + satire '' . 
   yellow * now * i 'm triggered, 
  thank you . 
  i know brits are incredibly nice and friendly people . 
  i grew up in a city with a big british army base . 
  the british guys were fantastic . 
  i even developed a weird love for the scottish accent ... other than that , britain is about the only country in europe , where i would n't want to live at the moment . 
  not because of the people , but because of politics . 
  i hope , you 're right , 
  i do n't have an agenda , but i think sorry britain * has * indeed become the laughingstock of europe . 
  it 's just insane , how many lies ( about the eu ) you 've been fed from your media . 
  and noone would argue the daily mail , daily express or the sun and similar `` papers '' have any interest in reporting the truth . 
  they all push * their * agenda ... 
  since you mentioned it . 
  honest question : what are the positives of the uk ? 
  but true, 
  it 's hard to have any sympathies for britain , these days . 
  the main stage of rock am ring is at the backside of the pitlane , start-finish is where you 'd buy souvenirs and food at rar festival , yes . 
  the second one from the left seems to be the bagger 288 . 
  and holy shit , what did i just watch ?? 
  this is what coal mining looks like in my area : [ garzweiler ii ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/tagebau_garzweiler_panorama_2005.jpg ) will be germany 's 2nd largest sea in about 100 years ... 
  are there any rumours on qe2 's stance on brexit ? 
  pharma ? 
  flown by plane ? 
  food ? 
  clothes ? 
  when did you use gps the last time ? 
  netflix , hbo , hollywood ? 
  american books ? 
  when was the last time you read an online article from an american website ? 
  pornography ? 
  in addition : i can tell from your comment , you 're male . 
  because both the female hygiene and beauty markets are pretty dominated by american companies . 
  til google , facebook and yt make their money from user 's payments, 
  yes , you 're perfectly right !, 
  i honestly ca n't tell , why so few people see through this bigotry . 
  the post would be perfect , if it said `` sent from my ipad '' underneath it . 
  lol, 
  could you imagine there was * one * company that did both ? 
  now , that would be some evil corporation ... 
  tl ; dr : op wo n't buy american , unless it becomes a bit inconvenient  of course , this wo n't apply to it services and products , and other technological items , for obvious reasons  no american foodstuff , at least to the extent of what 's possible . 
  you only need one arm to salute o7 otherwise you 'll find out , if you keep asking questions, 
  firstly , this is n't * your * arm , it 's the reich 's arm . 
  secondly , it 's the reich , that decides if the arm is missing . 
  what if i say `` yes '' ? 
  hmm , does n't sound too good . 
  i hope this fight turns out successful , imho putting an end to corruption would be * truely * benefitial . 
  are there any milestones in his fight against corruption ? 
  i 've heard some mixed news a few months ago . 
  does klaus feel comfortable in his office ? 
  i hope so , he seems a reasonable politician to me . 
  how is his work perceived by the bromanians on here ? 
  is he successful in tackling corruption ? 
  get that shit outta there . 
  we invented concrete , asphalt and steel . 
  and we still rely on `` sand '' when at the beach ... ? 
  pathetic, 
  sch\u00e4uble is cdu . 
  yep , you nailed it . 
  this regulation is utterly pointless , and therefore needs to go, 
  oooh crap , what fucked up bureaucrat in brussels thought this would be a good idea ? 
  netflix - now 30 % more bullshit i used netflix to escape the bullshit on tv , now they 're forcing that bs onto netflix , 'cause otherwise they would n't be able to com-fucking-pete . 
  what an arsehole move !, 
  yea , agreed . 
  they should make more translations available . 
  may i ask , if you 're living in croatia ? 
  i did n't know , arte is on tv in other countries than french and german speaking ones . 
  it 's available with english subtitles : http://www.arte.tv/en/, 
  this is just sick . 
  let 's hope the best for the people in manchester . 
  my thoughts are with you !, 
  i remember , the eurofighter won most of the dogfights , but not all of them . 
  under regular conditions , the eurofighter could n't even make it into the dogfight scenario . 
  that was x :0 for the f-35 !, 
  could n't find it anymore , otherwise i would have linked it . 
  it was posted on this sub a few months ago . 
  here 's an article from business insider pointing in that direction : [ why the f-35 could ` never in a million years ' beat the raf typhoon or the russian su-35 in a dogfight ] ( http://www.businessinsider.de/f-35-could-not-dogfight-typhoon-su-35-2016-8?r=us&amp;ir=t ) note : this article is from august ' 16 , before ( ! ), 
  the maneuver between typhoon and f-35 had happened . 
  it was rather disastrous for the eurofighter . 
  i think it 's also a great diplomatic maneuver towards trump : he demanded us to fullfill the 2 % spending on defense . 
  he asked us to close our trade-surplus . 
  his personal relations with russia are `` dubious '' to say the least . 
  we can combine the first two demands and then tell him , we need these f-35 against russian aggression in eastern europe .
