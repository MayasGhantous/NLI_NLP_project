  there are no adults in this relationship, 
  bigger one called ariane venti, 
   the basic role model one could possibly have is a teacher !, 
  dont dare you tell me , that none of your stem teachers in school were female . 
  stem-subjects were still heavily dominated by men , even though there were more female teachers overall . 
  in physics there were actually no women teaching at my school at all . 
  i do n't know how it is in latvia , but [ russia at least has way more women going into tech jobs ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39579321 ) than western european countries so maybe you are just from a country that is doing pretty well in this regard already . 
  he sprayed chalk on the road . 
  i better go and call the cop on my neigbours children , they are evil vandals . 
  when they look at pictures . 
  in reality , price and location are clearly the dominant factors when people decide where to live . 
  i can certainly see the appeal of older buildings as well , but i also made the experience that beauty is overrated and expensive when it comes to living somewhere . 
  also the people here are jizzing way to hard over some ornamental facades that look like plastic . 
  building facades have a quite minor effect on quality of life . 
  things like affordability of living space are significanlty more important for that . 
  yeah i know . 
  you 're barking up the wrong tree . 
  so / r/lewronggeneration is a thing for architecture as well , huh ? 
  is it wrong ? 
  the `` first lady '' unofficially already had a status , a staff and a budget from the public purse . 
  this would just clarify the whole situation to make it more transparent . 
  also cheaper , since it would give the `` first lady '' fewer means than what previous ones had . 
  ca n't be labeled as feta though, 
  imagine how the snap election would have gone without brexit and may fucking up on every opportunity . 
  it happened in konstanz and [ everyone ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=konstanz&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj5ruegwrdvahvhj8akhvw5df0q_auidcgd&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=947 ) is reporting it, 
  come on now , he could be thinking about the stasi as well . 
  they seem to have been corrupt in germany as well , for example by colluding against the suppliers to keep prices down . 
  i mean why would n't they be corrupt in the country where they have the most leverage ? 
  look , in germany it is quite simply aryan = nazi . 
  there is no ambiguity left there . 
  i honestly doubt identifying yourself as aryan would go over much better in the netherlands btw . 
  20-28 is 9 days , but otherwise this . 
   dehumanization is never funny when applied to ** an ethnicity ** just to give you a hint where you went wrong . 
  yeah , but taking into account who it is aimed at is kind of important . 
  as you can see in this thread , a lot of non-germans do n't have the cultural understanding of germany required to even get the premise of the video . 
   dehumanization is never funny when applied to an ethnicity luckily that is not what is happening here, 
   i just watched a joke about putting ethnic germans in reservations already wrong , please try again . 
  it has a taste that was also used for stuff at the dentist when i was a kid . 
  that 's not a good thing . 
  also because it is not something popular , the only one i ever tried over here was a&w . maybe others would taste better , but i am not really interested in finding out . 
   ~ ~ i 'm just an ordinary software developer , not a politician , ~ ~ there really is no point of having an intelligent debate here on reddit about anything lmao . 
  that 's a somewhat better argument , you should have said that first . 
  that 's a fucking stupid argument, 
  friendship ended with students , now ukip voters are my best friend . 
  if you google `` keynes di '' digging holes is the first autosuggest , so it is definitely not a phrase invented solely for this article . 
  edit : the [ actual quote apparently is  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_general_theory_of_employment,_interest_and_money#book_iii:_the_propensity_to_consume )  `` if the treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes , bury them at suitable depths in disused coalmines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish , and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again ( the right to do so being obtained , of course , by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory ) , there need be no more unemployment and , with the help of the repercussions , the real income of the community , and its capital wealth also , would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is . 
  it would , indeed , be more sensible to build houses and the like ; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this , the above would be better than nothing . '', 
  there were n't even any pineapples in germany after the war , [ do n't believe his lies . 
  if you just read the responses , you would n't have to guess you know ? 
   american kids start pledging loyalty to their country at age 7 every morning in school until they leave high school and it 's fucking stupid . 
  if you look closely you can see it is electrified, 
  it 's a / r/soccer joke . 
  arsene wenger , manager of arsenal , often says he almost signed certain players at some point in the past . 
  nah , in a few years we will hear how the uk almost signed brexit . 
  i think we are pretty much in agreement . 
  i 'm sorry , i think i misread your first post a bit . 
  if the uk managed to get something signifcant out of this it would definitely send the wrong signal . 
  there definitely needs to be a mechanism like you descibe at some point in the future . 
  the eu can not afford to treat members unfairly or unequally , only allowing economical powerhouses to bend the rules to their will while leaving less rich countries with fewer options . 
  they negotiated their preferential treatment by being the second biggest economy in the eu and the second biggest net contributor to the eu budget . 
  if they were worth it before this whole ordeal started , they are still worth it now . 
  mid - to long term a two-speed eu is inevitable the way i see it , so we might as well have the uk on board for as much as possible . 
  after election , representatives are only bound by law and their own conscience . 
  this includes the abiliy to go against the expressed wishes of the electorate . 
  the people only get vote that actually matters in the general election . 
  that is how representative democracy is intended to work . 
  you seem to have problems understanding this very basic principle . 
  not at all , i 'm just saying there would still be no problem if they changed their mind . 
  mps are elected to vote in parliament and are free to do whatever they want with that right . 
  it would just be representative democracy working as intended, 
  parliament is sovereign . 
  if an anti-brexit parliament was elected , ignoring the referundum or having another one would be well within its rights, 
  if the people overturned it , it obviously would n't be anti-democratic . 
  the uk staying is the best outcome for the rest of the eu as well , so i do n't really see the problem there . 
  maybe they will demand from the uk to refrain from pulling something like this for a decade or three , but overall the uk would clearly be a valuable member to have . 
  merkel is a pathological altruist ? 
  do n't make me laugh, 
  easier said than done and certainly no solution that would work quickly . 
   the european union threatened to counter with tariffs of its own on products ranging from florida oranges to cars produced in michigan , with each tariff calculated to likewise hurt the president in a key marginal state . 
  nice . 
  `` klar wie klo\u00dfbr\u00fche '' actually means something is crystal clear . 
  we just like the alliteration , even if it does n't make sense when you think about it . 
  when i first saw it irl i thought there would be more church around the dome . 
  i just thought : `` so that 's it huh ? '', 
  dresden has been rebuild quite nicely though . 
  the city center feels a bit too touristy and plastic maybe , but it is beautiful . 
  but gayer . 
  yes , the number of yes votes would not be possible otherwise, 
  that would be news to me, 
  it is not going to cause economic trouble per se , but may very well end up costing the uk 0,1 % or more in annual growth each year . 
  those opportunity costs will ad up over time . 
  just according to keikaku, 
  brb , texting my old drama teacher, 
  wan na know how i know you never had a d\u00f6ner ?

  i thought [ this was general knowledge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyst8k8vp6k&amp;user=uc7u9giycmqxaailpoqlh3ow ) by now, 
  are she and corbyn the least competent major party leaders the uk ever had simultaneously ?

  this is about womens preferences though,
