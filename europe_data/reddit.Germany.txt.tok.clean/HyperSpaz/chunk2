  strangely reassuring to know even if he had kept ownership , it would be mostly gone by now . 
  yes , i do think there should be punishment for crimes , and there 's certainly varying opinions about which are proportional or sensible . 
  you ca n't equivocate being opposed to one form of punishment with an extreme stance of criminal justice . 
  that 's only arguing against a strawman , and i do n't want to spend any more time on this . 
  you can have the last word , if you like . 
  are you american by any chance ? 
  apart from belarus , the death penalty is abolished in all of europe , so here it 's hardly a `` lefty-liberal '' position to oppose it . 
  and to my friends in india , their cousins who grew up in the same house are brothers and sisters . 
  i do n't see that as a problem , having a trusted contact who already lives in the country makes life as a immigrant/refugee easier for both them and the rest of society , no matter how close or far the relation is on paper . 
  your second edit , i think more people ( including me ) would have replied differently if you had put that as your * first * edit . 
  and you should probably know that on the internet , views like that are expressed all the time . 
  if you speak german , look at [ eaudestrache.at ] ( http://www.eaudestrache.at/ ) ... ( i 'm applying goodwill here in assuming that you 're not just backtracking . ), 
  that discussion has been had several times before . 
  there 's also the language being a factor , having relatives in the uk ... 
  that 's a brilliant idea , and i 'm surprised you left out more examples of persistent problems that , according to your logic , should be fixed that way .

  who knew that universal death penalty is all that 's needed to achieve a harmonious society ? 
  we could have saved so much money . 
  read the other articles on that site !, 
  totally fascinating , it 's like the russian version of / r/pyongyang . 
  take [ this story ] ( http://russia-news.us/news/lifestyle/kyrgyzstan-bans-homosexual-propaganda/ ) for instance , everybody i know would talk about just a bit differently :  on wednesday , the kyrgyz parliament banned homosexual propaganda in the second reading . 
   an array of mps advocates the preservation of family values by banning `` non-traditional sexual relations . '' or glance over the latest headlines at the moment : * fursenko : russian scientists have no difficulties with foreign colleagues * bank of russia to issue 20 million notes in honor of crimea * kazakhstan to introduce visa-free regime for oecd countries * boeing to carry on business in russia despite sanctions * fur executive committee wants capello to continue working * kyrgyzstan bans homosexual propaganda * sergey aksyonov hopes crimean athletes will perform for russia at 2016 olympics * putin 's approval rating peaked - 89 % summary : everything is alright with russia , there is no cause for concern .

  i meant , do you have to be registered in order to work , what are the administrative hurdles that immigrants are likely to encounter ? 
  i know it 's that way in germany and sweden , but no idea about uk . 
  if you 've been granted asylum in france but it takes a year before you can start legally earning money , or they crack down hard if you do anyway , then you might want to go looking for another country . 
  what 's the difference in labour laws between france and uk ? 
  oh right , there 's a glimpse of a bushy tail at the very end !, 
  them and dozens of their staffers !, 
  you can argue about the usefulness of a g8/g7 , but there 's no point to claim that it 's frugal . 
  the little cart is being dragged by a car , right ? 
  there 's a line stretching out from the front .

  russia would still lose a lot of money from this !, 
  preparing for a world cup is an investment , and in russia all expenses are scaled up through the `` porous '' nature of the financial channels there . 
  if germany , argentina , brazil , etc. 
  do n't play they get even less of that money back . 
  of course , fifa could go on the defense and float them , just to make a statement . 
  i 'm actually afraid it will be interpreted like that . 
  i can absolutely see how it will increase tensions with russia because the media ( both european and russian ) really like that narrative . 
  people and newspapers in europe will be happy to say `` we did n't want to play in russia anyway '' , and since it 's a more compelling story than sports executives taking bribes it might eventually overtake the original idea . 
  and the same in russia , where the public is already a bit removed from the `` western '' version of the news , it would be easy to totally focus on the `` europe is shunning russia '' interpretation in order to move the public opinion towards more isolationism , more nationalism . 
  after all , this step really does hurt russia financially !, 
  if there 's a war in 10 years and by the time i 'm 60 historians are talking about how it all started with football corruption , i 'll be bloody annoyed !,

  my friends have asked me to remind every russian i meet that it was them who invented your alphabet ;-) i hope we can still be friends . 
  did you just make that up ? 
  i like the second one . 
  it 's a hexagon !, 
  maybe that will change once someone starts sticking it on my furniture . 
  was that made by some kind of poilitical campaign ? 
  oh , i did n't realize it was a series . 
  at least i guess that 's what this means , the video is blocked in belgium . 
  where on this computer can i shove my passport ? 
  edit : oh , there 's an internationally available version !, 
  did they point towards material which went missing due to the confiscation ? 
  i guess they would have made remote backups of documents and photographs obtained in qatar as soon as possible , but maybe not video footage . 
  someone catch me up . 
  is poland on the verge of being attacked ? 
  what 's going on ? 
  i seriously pondered whether bavarian should be considered its own language . 
  me too , it ` sh hilarioush . 
  that makes two of us . 
  i wanted to choose russia , but i do n't consider them european . 
  what about social democrat ? 
  that may be a bit too specific , but could hit the spot between centrist and socialist . 
  is that a code-word for `` immigrant youths '' ? 
  i was hoping the whole story through not to hear that expression . 
  i suppose if that were the case the french version of the daily mail would be more than happy to exercise themselves in some good old sedition . 
  those guys can be grateful they 're even countries .

  wow , that cordoba card looks great . 
  i believe she 'll be getting a postcard from me .

   but i leave this though : the method of killing chickens resembles halal slaughtering , does n't it ? 
  and there 's a point you want to make in some way with that ?
