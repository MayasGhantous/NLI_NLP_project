now how to get schleswig-holstein and oldenburg back ... cute, 
  which is fucking pointless because this assumes that these exports would be the same regardless if the uk was or was not a eu member , and more importantly , am member kf the common market . 
  i think that assumption is highly problematic to say the least . 
  you might want to consider posting to / r/germany, 
  definitely berlin, 
   not true , right now there are only two respected ex-politicians in germany : helmut schmidt and hans-dietrich genscher . 
  and richard von weizs\u00e4cker . 
  that 's a nice story , thanks for the link, 
  i demand an explenation !, 
  krampus is widely known in southern bavaria too, 
  many of these stories are very local and only very few are known in larger regions , let alone the entire country . 
  i can tell you a very old tale people told their children in the region i am from . 
  i doupt that it is know just a few kilometers away . 
  so there js this old ruined castle called hohenkr\u00e4hen . 
  alledgedly an evil knight that once lived there way sentences to eternally haunt it , as punishment for his wrongdoings . 
  he would play tricks on the peasents , so that he would be eternally remembered as the nuicance he was . 
  [ here is the german wikipedia article ] ( http://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/burg_hohenkr%c3%a4hen#die_legende_vom_poppele ), 
  what the hell even is cryptocommunist, 
  there are plenty of big events that happened in march . 
  i 'm at work , will edit for more details later, 
  dirty swiss people who come here for shopping take our parking spots !, 
  i read your post in churchills voice , 
  yeah but that is always a question of perspective . 
  if you ask me the situation is not optimal in germany either . 
  far from it . 
  but that is a mute point anyway . 
  not like i want to split the eu or anything . 
  i was just arguing for the heck of it , 
  thought i made the implied / s pretty clear . 
  but poland has a strong unionist tradition too , right ? 
  just think of solidarno\u015b\u0107 . 
  france and italy are in the g8 . 
  allmost all of southern europe is in nato . 
  countries like spain and portugal have a huge influence because of their colonial past and ties to south/middle america . 
  fair enough . 
  thanks for looking up the data , 
  to be fair that is a general trend , not just on / r/europe, 
  i do n't think so . 
  i think we gain more by getting southern europe up to speed . 
  we need their markets and their political weight . 
  i think it is more a case of north vs south ( with france beeing south in this case ) last i heard the netherlands and the scandinavians were doing fine and the uk is getting better too . 
  sweet, 
   1918 europe lets russia go full retard - cue soviet anthem music that 's right . 
  they did that all on their own . 
  germany had nothing to do with it . 
  now move along . 
  so this is a series ? 
  how many parts will there be ? 
  looking forward to it, 
   they should see rome instead . 
  it 's sad though that those places are getting bad reputation in times of recession . 
  how is rome , the eternal city , getting a bad reputation ? 
  there are a few local holidays in germany . 
  there is one specific to augsburg ( 8th of august ) for example . 
  the augsburg peace festival originates from the end of the 30 years war when the protestants there celebrated the end of catholic oppression . 
  lucky for you prussia is no more ... 
  i say give them the rest of it . 
  plus he is still pretty young . 
  not lke he has to be speaker of parliament for ever , right ? 
  thanks scotland, 
  maybe they will get their act together once eu builds the european intergalactic strike fleet , 
   aliens might exist , and they might be hostile ... 
  even if they are not we could colonize their ass, 
  euro group as in uefa euro championship ? 
  hell no , you are on your own there :d, 
  nah not really . 
  turns out that poland guy is actually quite ok . france likes him too , 
  yeah ... among a few other places . 
  poland wo n't go down period . 
  not unless all of western europe goes down with it . 
  there is no way in hell germany would stay neutral if poland is invaded . 
  and this time we bring the french with us . 
  you might have some old numbers there buddy , 
  we are your eu and nato bros too . 
  our politicians just have no balls ( contrary to yours ), 
  that is actually a brilliant idea . 
  have them apply and let the people choose what country gets to send their lunatics over , 
  it is really sad how far eu-bashing has spread . 
  sure the eu is not perfect , but i still can not see how the negatives could possibly outweigh the positives . 
  sure a slow response by the eu is not as good as a rapid one . 
  but one response by europe rather than 28 is a big deal too . 
  i should stop watching clips like this one whenever they are posted . 
  they always leave me with a mixture of anger , sadness and confusion . 
  made me think of how i imagined avalon as a child, 
  i do n't suppose you 'll like [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/imperial_coat_of_arms_of_germany_%281848%29.svg ) then, 
  maybe 3 lions ? 
  but still better than [ this ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundeswappen_deutschlands#mediaviewer/datei:coat_of_arms_of_germany.svg ), 
  ok , this is pretty great, 
  well we could use [ this eagle ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsbanner_des_heiligen_r%c3%b6mischen_reiches#mediaviewer/datei:heiliges_r%c3%b6misches_reich_-_reichssturmfahne_vor_1433.svg ) instead, 
  it is a really sexy design , but it might be too close to [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/reichsadler_der_deutsches_reich_%281933%e2%80%931945%29.svg ), 
  winning hearts and minds like a true american . 
  give people a call or text if you get held up . 
  otherwise it comes across as extremely rude . 
  yes , it 100 % depends on how it is approached . 
  the topic of ww2 and all that surrounds it is a really dense minefield that is very difficult to navigate for someone who does not know german political correctness . 
  and even if you do everything right , some people just do n't want to talk about it . 
  the german media did report that a day before the cia guy was thrown out of germany a parlamentary commission from the bundestag went to washington . 
  they reportedly were not met with any cooperation or understanding from the us officials . 
  the german government has gone almost as far as begging to get the us to cooperate with clearing up these affairs . 
  it is pretty save to say that the german government saw this as the only thing they could do to get the us government to pay any attention .
