  they have tried all the other channels before to no effect . 
  hahahahaha that was a good one, 
  fasnacht , carneval and all those different regional forms it takes . 
  most originalte in celebrations to mark the turn of the seasons . 
  in spring they mark the end of winter , so people want to drive away the evil winter demons . 
  these traditions differ alot between regions . 
  people dress up in their regionally specific demonic costumes . 
  not now , but who knows how the world ( and the eu for that matter ) looks in 20-30 years, 
  i think we settled that in 1866, 
  it 's fine having some perspective from across the pond does not hurt . 
  i enjoyed reading it . 
  i 'd agree to friedrich the great of prussia beeing a good choice . 
  i do n't know enough about karl v, 
  that 's what you get when ww1 and ww2 is basically all that is thought in history class and what 90 % of history documentaries are about . 
  it has gotten better in the past with the excellent zdf series about german history ( `` die deutschen '' ) . 
  there are still plenty good candidates to choose from . 
  otto the great , frederick ii and frederick the great of prussia to name a few, 
  a solid choice . 
  he was a warmonger like all rulers of that time , but he also wrote extensively about philosophy and gave prussia a modern-ish set of laws . 
  there is a [ great bbc documentary about him on youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wmnkd6-cmy ), 
  i 'd pick [ friedrich ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_ii,_holy_roman_emperor ) . 
  there is hardly a more interesting ruler in medieval europe . 
  he took control of jerusalem back with diplomatic means while being excommunicated by the pope . 
  he could also be considered one of the first natural scientist , who wrote extensively about [ how to hunt with birds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_arte_venandi_cum_avibus ) edit : just thought i should mention [ otto the great ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_the_great ) too . 
  he defended east francia against the magyars and brought the germanic tribes living in east francia closer together . 
  without him , germany today might not exist . 
  plus he secured the imperial crown for east francia . 
  edit2 : another great pick would have been [ karl iv. , emperor of the hre and king of bohemia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_iv,_holy_roman_emperor ) solely for the imperial reforms he passed , wich gave stability to the hre up until the 30 years war . 
  of course it is blocked in germany . 
  is it not in austria ? 
  i think that is a save bet . 
  i did not hear any criticism from those protesters at all . 
  they just yelled `` you are warmongers '' . 
  who ? 
  is this targeted at the spd , the entire german government ? 
  the eu ? 
  why ? 
  because they took issue that a souvereign country in europe had a part of it 's territory annexed ? 
  quick tip : the warmongers are usually those guys who have troops on the wrong side of their border . 
  but what if we want to build an intergalactic fleet someday ? 
  eurovision is happening . 
  you ca n't make this shit up . 
  i was thinking about [ this time ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_schleswig_war ), 
  hey austria let 's go to war with denmark again . 
  beethoven is spinning in his grave !, 
  choosing a favorite dish from italy is almost impossible for me . 
  but risotto is pretty high up there, 
  [ sachertorte ] ( http://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:wien_-_sachertorte.jpg ) may be the best thing austria has ever done for humanity . 
   it 's strange that the consequences from fossil fuels can be quantified ( asthma , cancer , acid rain , global warming , etc ) and yet we still use them . 
  so the conclusion there is that we should not be using either in the long run . 
  what we really need is more research into efficient and sustainable power generation . 
  hell , maybe even nuclear fusion will help us out there . 
  sure , we might never have a totally risk free power generation , and there will always be some dangers to live in our societies . 
  i see and accept that . 
  let 's just not have a source of power that is as unpredictable as nuclear power plants are in the worst case scenario . 
  a 30 km radius might not be as big of a problem in ukraine as it is in germany . 
  [ this is a map of germany 's nuclear power plants ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/kernkraftwerke_in_deutschland.svg ) . 
  the nuclear plant stade is 30 km away from hamburg for example . 
  and what if it is 50 km this time instead of 30 ? 
  we can not afford risks like that . 
  not if it will take decades to clean these areas up . 
  what do you think it would cost us to abandon a city like hamburg with 1.7 million people living there ? 
  what would be the damage to culture and history ? 
  that city is 1200 years old for god 's sake . 
  the problem is that such risks can not be quantified . 
  it is possible ( even if the possibility is very small ) that that might happen . 
  and the scale is impossible to predict . 
  i think it is mainly a merkel-thing . 
  she was re-elected because the german economy is in a good place . 
  but on many issues she has a big opposition in the german population . 
  her and her governments actions do not represent the opinion of all germans . 
  that beeing said , i am conflicted on this issue too . 
  on the one side i think we should back poland ( also but not just for ... historical reasons ) . 
  on the other side burning all bridges with russia might end up pretty dangerous . 
  plus if this were to escalate into war let 's please remember that europe is in range of russias nukes . 
  sure , france , uk and us have nukes too , but that wo n't help us if russia shoots theirs first . 
  also let 's not forget that merkel allegetly said that putin is out of touch with reality ... which scare me more than i like to admit . 
  germany does have some channels to influence russia , mainly throu old relations and `` soft '' economic pressure . 
  that is how we got chodorkowski free . 
  severing these connections could be really bad for the future . 
  i 'd say that includes east germany to a degree . 
  sure it was not part of the ussr , but massive amounts of troops where stationed here . 
  plus it is pretty clear that without poland and hungary , the fall of the wall would not have happened . 
  100 % agree, 
  the german chancellor can also not dissolve parliament and initiate new elections by himself . 
  he ( or she ) can be replaced by parliament with a new chancellor if the majority is against him ( or her ) . 
  well to be fair i was only half serious  but i am sure you get my point, 
  not if you ask them, 
  tell that to the german soldiers that died in afghanistan !, 
  oh i did not mean it like this . 
  i just meant that we should have progressed to a point where conflicts are resolved in a different way . 
  especially after the last century . 
  it was not meant as an accusation against anybody , just my disappointment in the state of the world . 
  ok you were not kidding with nsfl . 
  what the actual fuck . 
  i do n't know if i am sad or angry but there is no way this should be happening in europe in the 21st century . 
  [ labskaus ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/labskaus.jpg ) can be pretty terrible . 
  not because what is in it but because how it looks . 
  like someone vomited chunky blood . 
   germany started the eu .
