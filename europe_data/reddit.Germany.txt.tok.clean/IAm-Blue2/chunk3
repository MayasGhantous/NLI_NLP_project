  interesting . 
  most people here in germany would say it was started by the french to keep western germany 's economy in check because it had recovered faster from ww2 than expected . 
  many people also think that the euro was started to keep the unified germany in check . 
  i think this is one of the worst problems we have in the eu . 
  there are completely different views on what the eu is and what it should be . 
  sorry i am a bit late to this . 
  byzantium had a very big influence on the early holy roman empire , because of [ theophanu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theophanu ) . 
  after [ otto the great ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_i,_holy_roman_emperor ) became emperor and king of italy he sought an alliance with byzantium to strengthen his position in europe . 
  his son , the future [ otto ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_ii,_holy_roman_emperor ) was married to a relative of the byzantine emperor john i tzimiskes . 
  after otto i died his son otto ii took over as emperor , but his reign was very unstable . 
  [ henry ii of bavaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_ii_of_bavaria ) claimed regency of the empire and abducted the son of otto ii and theophanu , otto iii . 
  otto ii died suddenly in 983 at only 28 years old , and it was theophanu who secured that her son otto iii would become the new emperor and the ottonian dynasty stayed in charge . 
  she became regent for her son as empress dowager . 
  she was without doubt the most powerful woman in europe at that time . 
  it is certainly to a large part her achievement that the empire remained relatively sable in this turbulent time . 
  she is a very interesting character . 
  here is a [ very good german documentary about her ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kviemvoeyqe ) . 
  she is also credited to introduce the fork in western europe ( see the wikipedia article about her for reference ) . 
  her influence can be seen in [ st. pantaleon 's church in cologne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_st._pantaleon ) . 
  it is the oldest church of the cult of saint pantaleon west of byzantium . 
  she ordered the construction of the current facade of the church and it is also where she was buried at her own request . 
  edit : [ here is a picture of theophanu 's beautiful marriage certificate with otto ii ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/urkunde01.jpg ), 
  i totally forgot about this , see above for my take on the situation in germany . 
  sorry i totally forgot about this thread . 
  so here is * my take * on ** germany ** : according to the [ latest polls ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/europawahl.htm ) about 7 % would vote for the afd ( that is our euro skeptic party ) . 
  but it is save to say that there is a lot more skepticism on how things are going that just those 7 % . 
  the big banking crisis of 2007 and later sacred a lot of people and although germany recovered quicker than many others , people are still very afraid that we could return to that situation . 
  many sensationalist newspaper articles and some populist parties ( like the afd ) sow a lot of distrust in the government . 
  it does not help that the current euro crisis is hugely complex and the government has failed on many occasions to explain why they are taking the steps they are taking . 
  people either get very confused and scared , or they seem to pretend nothing bad is going on at all and pretend everything is fine . 
  but there is a very wide consensus , that the european union and by extension the euro is a positive thing that benefits us and that should be kept intact . 
  there is no way in hell germany will leave the ** eu ** and many people feel it is essential for keeping good relations with our neighbors ( france and poland especially ) . 
  there is no essential criticism of the eu , but people do want reforms to prevent the same mess happening again . 
  angela merkel and her past government is often criticized for not taking the necessary steps towards these reforms . 
  they are fixing the symptoms not the core problems . 
  things are a bit different when it comes to the ** euro ** . 
  many people wish we still had the deutsche mark , but i think most realize that we can not easily go back to it now . 
  the bailouts for greece are hugely unpopular but there is no alternative in sight . 
  merkels support for austerity is somewhat popular , because germans in general seem to have a big fear of debt and inflation . 
  many historians argue that that goes back to the economic crisis in the 1920s . 
  the social democrats campaigned during the last legislative period to move away from austerity and grant more economic stimuli to southern europe to get the economies there going again . 
  but they still voted along the governments discussions in parliament out of fear that doing nothing would be way worse . 
  i think their suggestion to move away from austerity had only very limited success with the voters . 
  people do realize that something needs to be done to help southern europe , but they are afraid that germany would end up paining for all of it , and that would cost german workers some of their income , which did not see any big raises in the last couple years . 
  it is interesting that german voters have lately been against ( ! ), 
  tax breaks in germany out of fear the government would fall into too much dept. 
  instead higher taxes for the very wealthy are still somewhat popular . 
  i think it is possible to interpret this as austerity that germany and the german voters inflict on themselves . 
  angela merkel 's previous coalition partner , the free democrats ( fdp ) campaigned for lower taxes for working people in the election 5 years ago , but instead lowered taxes for big hotels once they were in government . 
  this has been seen as breaking election promises by many people and as a result they did not even make it into parliament after the last election . 
  i personally thing we need europe-wide solutions but europe is too busy fighting and critiquing each other to come up with any . 
  now the new course of the cdu/spd government does not seem clear yet , at least to me . 
  ** edit ** : holy shit that got way longer than i intended . 
  do n't take what i wrote here as absolute fact , it is just my take on it and i am sure that some people will disagree . 
  but feel free to reply if you want me to clarify some of these ramblings  ** edit 2 ** : here is another [ link to a poll about the upcoming european election ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/uploads/tx_nosimplegallery/sf_europawahl_03.png ) ** edit3 ** i added another passage about the german discussion about tax levels and the free democrats because i think it is somewhat relevant to this . 
  that 's it , not touching this post any more . 
  i assume you already know this about germany ? 
  yeah i recall that i had the same problem . 
  maybe it should be worded differently next time ? 
  or put a phrase under it for clarification . 
  if you are right the cdu would have to look for alternatives if they want to stay in power . 
  von der leyen and de maizi\u00e8re look the most likely right now . 
  sch\u00e4uble is too old and then there is none else i can think of . 
  that would make this her last term ... let 's see if she still says that in 3.5 years, 
  7 % for afd ? 
  really ? 
  sad times . 
  because all live streams are . 
  they could be playing evil copyrighted music . 
  seriously fuck gema . 
  i do n't know , that 's my point . 
  it does not make sense to me why lisboa and zaragoza are changed , but toledo , madrid , barcelona , sevilla , bilbao etc are not changed at all . 
  not what i was expecting http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314, 
  yeah the umlaute on the german cities ( like the \u00f6 on k\u00f6ln ) are a dead giveaway . 
  i think it is funny how city names get translated into different languages . 
  for example german does not change much about english or french city names , but we change quite a lot of italian city names ( firenze to florenz , milano to mailand , roma to rom etc. ) . 
  spanish cities are odd in german too . 
  most are exactly the same , but we do change zaragoza to saragossa . 
  makes no sense to me . 
  as far as i can see the cities are in their respective native languages . 
  surprising how many countries a 100 % the same as in german ( italien , tunesien schweiz , ukraine , polen , ungarn , spanien , portugal , marokko , england , wales , irland ... ), 
  it sounds very strange to me . 
  its hard for me to describe it . 
  i kept hearing passages that made me think of south german dialects ( mainly bavarian and swiss ) but some parts sounded rusian or polish to me . 
  also true for germany . 
  for each joke about poles or french we have 10 about bavarians etc. 
  of course . 
  merkel has won after all . 
  free baden from w\u00fcrttemberg , yes but not from germany . 
  we do n't like the swabians but we still want to be part of germany . 
  there is no separist movement in bw that would reflect the map, 
  why is baden-w\u00fcrttemberg on this map ? 
  there is no separist movement in bw , exept maybe the one to get baden as a seperate bundesland from w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  i have lived in bw all my life and i call bullshit on this map , as i did last time it was posted . 
  quite possible that forestry is agriculture . 
  we have that in germany too . 
  d\u00f6ner pizza is best pizza . 
  wow this is awesome . 
  you guys have the best comics . 
  i guess they get more sun than it is good for them ...
