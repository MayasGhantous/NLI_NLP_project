  i still think that has been a nasty coverup by the bavarian government . 
  i have seen the displayed corpse of the bear in the humting museum in munich looked just like a normal bear to me . 
  what are they hiding ? 
  aside from ticks i 'd say the boar . 
  an angry boar can really fuck you up . 
  and they have been comming closer to cities recently . 
  i 'd say he is pretty well known . 
  his works are a regular subject in german class at the high school level, 
  / r/justiceporn would love that, 
  oh i am well aware . 
  i mean no offense of course , just a bit of banter in good european tradition . 
  well who 's fault could that possibly be ? 
  let us hope you are correct, 
   spd - see cdu harsh but not unjustified . 
  pretty cynical but spot on non the less :-) edit : i am depressed now, 
  still , this could and should have been solved earlier , in agreement with poland , france and all the other major players . 
  instead merkels desicion have come at a snail 's pace , and not with enough consultation . 
  i have to agree . 
  merkel only cares for the polls and the headlines of bild . 
  the relations with france and our other european partners have taken a hit due to her desicion-making . 
  she and sch\u00e4uble are running this all by themselves . 
  it 's scary as hell . 
  - obviously this is my biased opinion . 
  nothing that ca n't be fixed with a new government . 
  obviously this is my personal , biased opinion : angela merkel has made too many desicions alone and not in consultation with our most important partners . 
  the only thing she takes into consideration is her standing in the polls . 
  what is scary about this is that there is still quite a while untill the next election ... and likely the social democrats will get blamed for the entire mess again . 
  first stage of anschluss ... 
  if the both of you are into art , then the pinakothek museums might be worth our time . 
  english website : http://www.pinakothek.de/en/home, 
  you can easily spend an entire day in the `` deutsches museum '' . 
  and it is worth it if you have any interest in science and technology . 
  / r/eu4 leaking again , 
  in my book you should, 
  thank you for your service !, 
  only if it comes with the colonialisation of space - it 'll be just like in the good old times, 
   watching those yodelshows on zdf you propably deserve an apology then, 
  not sure if sarcastic or serious ... 
  as it stands this story is about one thing above everything else . 
  the bnd is operationg outside of the constitution and with no control from the government or the parliament . 
  some people have been calling that treason , and i think it 's hard to argue against that . 
  ewwww, 
  have you tried asking nicely ? 
   kasier wilhelm ii of germany and prussia kaiser of germany and king of prussia, 
  nah only the pope gets to do that . 
  and even he has to follow the numbering convetion . 
  she would be elisabeth i then, 
  that 's tempting ... 
  i just ate one of [ these ] ( http://www.real-drive.de/medias/sys_master/images/productimages/3/340415_1_1_detail.jpg ), 
  this is why i do n't drink and reddit, 
  sounds like my kind of people, 
  i think the romans , angles , saxons , vikings and normans would disagree . 
  it always amuses me how this is a suprise to anyone . 
  prussia was not dismanteled by accident afer ww2, 
  he is too old, 
  good to kown ... * looks at stra\u00dfburg and k\u00f6nigsberg, 
  to be fair you did say `` germans '' not germany, 
   they are kind of new to this [ wat ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war ), 
  no we have been a kingdom too . 
  it is just that the king of germany ( elected by the princes ) would also get the title of emperor from the pope https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_germany, 
  you had me at weed, 
  just accept that there are around 10 % idiots in all countries, 
  on the other hand it is ( pretty ) standard for a new german chancellor or foreign minister to go to france first . 
  ewww think of the hair, 
  to be fair these are exactly the kind of debates we need to have . 
  no empire ? 
  [ in varietate concordia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motto_of_the_european_union ) united in diversity, 
  and include austria and switzerland . 
  those sould n't really be countries either . 
  good point . 
  ** germany ** a ) there is not one answer to this . 
  the boulevard was at first blaming greece and to a lesser extend spain , italy and portugal for fucking things up . 
  i think that phase has passed now . 
  now it 's just a big confusion . 
  maybe because the german economy is doing better the ever , with steady growth and record-lows in unemployment . 
  but there is also a lot of misinformation . 
  both media and government have miserably failed to explain to the people what is really going on . 
  b ) i think it is a strange mixture of happiness , that our economy is doing so well and the infamous german angst that is creeping up . 
  the people are afraid that they will have to pay for all that mess and that the crisis will come nocking on their doorstep . 
  at first there was an awful lot of trust in ms merkel and her pervious government with the social democrats , but since ms merkels party is ruling in coalition with the bussiness-friendly liberal fdp , trust in the government is gone , as ms merkel is changing her positions almost on a daily basis . 
  and the fdp is just a giant fuckup . 
  edit : spelling, 
  germany did n't say that , ms merkel did . 
  germany was n't asked and judging from recent state elections and oppinion polls , germany is n't too happy with ms merkel . 
  found this on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_language_in_europe ) : `` 13 % of eu citizens speak english as their native language . 
  another 38 % of eu citizens state that they have sufficient skills in english to have a conversation . '', 
  the data is from a 2005 eu survey , you can find it [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf ) . 
  however , this data is 7 years old and i would imagine that the percentage of people in europe undestanding english has grown . 
  i am shure there are more recent surveys on this . 
  but there is a hole other problem : the 51 % of 2005 does not include people that have a basic undestandig of english , that is not quite on the conversational level . 
  besides , these are surveys where the people asked have to evaluate their language skills themselves , so the real knowlege of the english language ma differ form the percentage in the survey results . 
  as to your `` real '' question : english is mandatory in germany , but the schooling system is a federal system in germany , so the regulations differ between the federal states . 
  it also differs between school forms . 
  as to why it was made mandatory : i think that also differs from state to state . 
  this german [ wikipedia article ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fremdsprachenunterricht ) says that english was made mandatory in hamburg in 1870 ( ! ) . 
  as of today states close to france offer french as a first foreign language , while thuringia offers russian . 
  much of this has to do with cultural connetions and history . 
  maybe we can rent the colloseum ? 
  it would only be appropriate .
