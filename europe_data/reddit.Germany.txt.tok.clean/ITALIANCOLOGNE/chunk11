  just as switzerland they currently have no need to become a member because they would n't have a lot of benefits . 
  they already focused their trade on eu countries and movement of capital/people is n't as strict as non-european countries . 
  of course this leads to some problems since they do n't have to listen to the eu council/parliament and switzerland , monaco and liechtenstein are known as economical safe havens . 
  that 's one reason why they do n't join . 
  another reason why some countries are n't part of the eea ( european economical area - do n't confuse it with the efta ) is that you can only become part of the eea if you are either member of the efta or the european union . 
  again there is no real reason why they should join the eu to become member of the eea since they already have similar treaties with the eu which covers most things included in the eea . 
  another point is the political and internal structure of the eu . 
  it 's simply not really based on the idea that small countries could join . 
  take the seats in the parliament for example . 
  the parliament follows a degressive proportionality . 
  this means that they are given proportionally in respect to the amount of inhabitants in each country starting with a base number of 6 - this means that malta with 400000 inhabitants gets more seats than they should get . 
  an addition of even smaller countries ( liechtenstein , monaco and san marino have all less than 40000 inhabitants ) would mean that they would get 6 seats regardless which would up the amount of seats in the parliament by a lot for only a handful of new `` inhabitants '' . 
  also the eea does n't really cover methods to secure national industry and in a complete free trade agreement those countries would get overrun . 
  you see the reasons are n't really clear since there are a lot of problems to consider . 
  however san marino had a referendum about joining the eu which was answered with `` yes '' by the population however it did n't reached the quorum of votes which is why it was rejected . 
  here 's a nice graph that shows the different institutions and which country is part of which group : [ click ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:supranational_european_bodies-en.svg ), 
  since nobody took the time to read the full poll , and for some reason the guardian does n't link to the study ( kind of sad for a serious newspaper imho ) i looked it up on their homepage . 
  here 's also the full [ pdf-document ] ( http://www.ipsos-mori.com/assets/docs/polls/attitudes-to-immigration-british-future-tables-2013.pdf ) with all the relevant data which , again , for some reason was n't part of the guardian article . 
  besides the weird statement from vince cable about 75 % gdp which for some reason is relevant to free movement or per capita gdp the article is n't accurate at all . 
  here 's why :  nearly half ( 45 % ) said that enforcing the minimum wage was one of the most important ways of stopping business undercutting british workers by paying european workers less . 
  nothing in the poll talks about this . 
  in fact the question was slightly different : `` enforce the minimum wage so businesses can not undercut british workers '' nothing talks about the `` past '' and rather that the uk ** should ** enforce a minimum wage ** to ** prevent immigrats from undercutting british workers . 
  the difference is small but it completely changes the perception . 
  the original question actually talked about actively combatting undercutting rather than an indirect by-product like the guardian wrote it . 
  one of the most scary things was n't even presented in the article . 
  i 'm talking about the fact that only 8 % of the 16-24 year olds are in favor of helping immigrants . 
  all other demographics have 20 % of agreement , 12 percent points difference , more than 100 % . 
   the polling also showed that , while a significant majority did want a tightening of the welfare system ( 63 % ) this shows that the guy writing the article did n't read the questionaire . 
  it was actually a ranking of several questions where the majority of the sample ( n = 2244 ) ranked it at # 1 shortly followed by the `` minimum wage '' question on # 2 . 
  this does n't mean that 63 % of the sample agreed with this statement . 
  it means that out of the 4.543 answers given 1423 people agreed with that statement . 
  in fact the original question was to pick 2 important questions , that 's why the total answers ( 4543 ) are almost twice as much as the sample population . 
  from the original questions it 's something like ~ 31 % . 
  compared with the sample population however it 's indeed 63 % however that 's a shitty way to measure it and the guy who read it probably knew about it . 
   just 2 % of those asked believed that there was nothing migrants from romania and bulgaria could do to be accepted . 
  this is such a biased statement . 
  sure this is correct since 2 % actually said that but 2 % also said that they should n't have to do anything special . 
  pointing out the one answer just fits the guardian 's agenda . 
  i understand that they do n't like the government , i do n't like cameron either , but they should at least try to be somewhat objective . 
  last but not least the awesome title . 
  the original question was : ** romanians and bulgarians coming to britain have got to learn the language , work hard and pay taxes , fit in and be part of the community . 
  if they do that , we should welcome them to the uk ** only this question got a 73 % from people aged 35-44 . 
  nowhere did they say `` yes '' to `` welcome immigrants '' per se . 
  now you might ask : why did the guardian choose the demographic 35-44 category ? 
  well for one the answer was `` top 2 box '' meaning that they added the votes for `` strongly agree '' and `` tend to agree '' . 
  for some reason `` tend to agree '' means `` hey boys , come over ! '', 
  but that 's journalism in a nutshell . 
  the reason why they choose this age group is because all other groups have - surprise , surprise - lower percentages . 
  all groups besides `` 35-44 '' have lower numbers with 25-34 having the lowest with 63 and the total average being 68 % . 
  not a bad average and it was named somewhere in the article but the title suggests something completely different . 
  the guardian basically took a questions cut off some important words and added the highest percent number to make it look like 73 % . 
  and for some reason they managed to change the 73 % into a 72 % , whatever . 
  the fact that they still called cameron a populist ( indirectly ) even though these numbers show that it is n't `` popular '' to hate on immigrants is kind of sad . 
  all in all it 's a pretty redundant poll since it tells nothing new . 
  an uneducated youth that does n't like immigrants . 
  that 's nothing new . 
  this happens everywhere . 
  maybe cameron should invest in education rather than passing bills to limit immigrants . 
  that 's like agreeing with xenophobes . 
  this has already happened a while ago . 
  my uni-course for example is some sort of international course with ~ 70 % foreigners ( in germany ) . 
  the majority of those foreigners are from eastern european countries . 
  really clever people who could come here because of the easier visa since 2011 ( iirc ) . 
  are those guys going to go back to their country once they finished their studies ? 
  probably not . 
  they will stay in germany and work here . 
  the point is that people always pull this nationalistic `` but germans will lose german workplaces because of some non-german bulgarians '' ( `` german '' can be changed with any other country in europe since this think-process is everywhere ) card but they seem to forget the obvious benefits from this change . 
  those students study in germany and who knows if they are ever going back to their countries . 
  but if they do they will transfer their knowledge back to bulgaria/romania and the whole country might benefit from them in the long-run . 
  human capital flight is probably bad in the short-run for those countries but for germany ? 
  the people who go to germany do n't spend their whole savings for a one-way-flight only to be homeless and uneducated here . 
  the ( right ) media in germany always tries to induce fear because for some reason a society needs a common enemy . 
  ( and for eu-member states those are usually africans and east-europeans ) . 
  the problem with brain-drain is that it 's not only one-sided . 
  many people have this urge to return home after a while and most people usually do . 
  a good example for this could be the italian who left for america in the 20s but came back once they made some money improving their region 's knowledge and capital . 
  this human capital is n't leaving europe . 
  it 's simply relocating and it will relocate again once a certain market is `` full '' . 
  when germany and france are n't going to be # 1 anymore immigrants will look for other opportuninites . 
  spain , italy and portugal might finally realize that immigrants are n't bad and they might stop sinking boats full of africans in the ocean which will eventually lead to better chances for immigrants in those countries . 
  people should stop thinking of eastern european people as some primitive natives who can neither write nor speak . 
  sure the educational level is ( way ) lower than germany 's but the brightest bulgarians are as clever as the brightest germans . 
  and the `` stupid '' africans are n't that much dumber than the dumbest italian . 
  dirty poles and russians cross the border to steal our cars , kids and wifes . 
  beware of 1/1/2014 when romanians get the rights to steal and pillage our western culture . 
  darn immigrants . 
  we should by a fence around those fuckers just like the us did with mexico . 
  keep those gypsy rapists away from our daughters . '', 
  that 's how i imagine how those xenophobes are arguing . 
  the myth of the workplace stealing ex-communist are so pathetic . 
  but hey as long as it 's only those guys we can easily hate on them , amirite ? 
  where is the scale coming from ? 
  because from a gay-marriage viewpoint it does n't make sense at all . 
  how does malta have almost double the points as italy and why are switzerland and austria way behind germany which has more or less the same laws ? 
  also it does n't claim to talk only about gays since its lgbti which means that many countries have basically no standpoint since they do n't have laws for/against intersex and trans people . 
  and how do they gather information about human rights in san marino and liechtenstein if they have a case once every year . 
  you should n't argue with him . 
  he 's an obvious troll spilling nationalistic bullshit . 
  just read the last paragraphs . 
  he 's trying so hard to look tough but acts like his word is divine .
