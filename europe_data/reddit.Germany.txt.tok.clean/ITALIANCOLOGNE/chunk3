  they want to push some european reforms and they believe that leaving the euro will be a good step for germany . 
  keep in mind that their leader ( bernd lucke ) claims to be an economist . 
  sounds crazy , i know ... 
  that 's wrong though . 
  braindrain is n't a one way road that leads to in berlin 's hospitals getting crowded with doctors . 
  generally speaking many workers will go back to their countries after they managed to make a lot of money in germany . 
  usually they also tend to send bsck a lot of money to their families which will increase their country 's economy . 
  many countries have economies that rely highly on citizens working in the us . 
  for a country this is an incredible source of income that will benefit the country in the long run . 
  i have a ton of romanians in my class at university who benefit from better education and will eventually go back to their country . 
  it 's obviously a problem in the short run but in the long run you 'll benefit from it . 
  absolutely . 
  that 's the problem if you only have 2 positions in a country . 
  both sides become irrational as fuck, 
   can you explain what the difference between the european council , the council of europe and the council of the european union it 's actually not that difficult if people would actually make use of their right to educate themselves . 
  the reason why many people do n't know about this is because national media is n't bringing it to their home via television or radio . 
  i think it has more to do with the lack of interest of the average citizen in politics . 
  the same thing could be said about national institutions . 
  ask a german what the second chamber besides the bundestag/parliament is . 
  i doubt that they know the name or how it 's build . 
  ask an italian what their perfect bicameralism is . 
  and italians are generally really interested in politics . 
  how many chambers does the eu have ? 
  nobody is going to tell you that . 
  you need to look it up yourself . 
  it 's your duty to actually learn your rights especially if you are living in a democracy where you are the highest instance . 
  but i totally agree that people should get an easier access to it . 
  also : the council of europe has nothing to do with the eu . 
  it sounds confusing but you are correct . 
  95 % would n't think that russia is part of a group that is called `` council of europe '' and that it has absolutely nothing to do with the union ( even though they share the same flag for some reason ) . 
  while all of your concerns are valid problems i do n't see how the eu could solve them itself . 
  `` more power '' is only going to happen if the members give up their sovereignty to some extend ; however this wo n't happen for obvious reasons . 
  i already adressed the media coverage but again i do n't see how the eu could improve this . 
  launching a european tv station that broadcasts in 24 ( ? ), 
  different languages could improve this but you ca n't force people to watch that station rather than bbc , rai or ard . 
  they could take an approach like bbc world which is actually a pretty good news channel . 
  but if the public does n't care about the eu no national station will give it more coverage . 
   there 's a too big influence of the industry absolutely . 
  yet again there are too many interests and a problematic flaw in the current lobby system itself . 
  while national industries are interested into eu law-making , since they can increase sales in other member states , the other branch of lobbying , unions , are simply not interested in brussels . 
  national unions remain national because they only represent national workers who do n't work in other countries . 
  and since job-related laws are still delegated from the eu to the member states they are n't caring about eu laws because often enough they are n't binding to nations . 
  a factory worker in liege is n't going to be interested in cheese-bacteria regulations concerning southern france and italy . 
  that 's why this worker 's union is n't going to care about brussels . 
  simply look at the biggest economy 's representation in brussels . 
  while the german industry federation has a building in brussels you wo n't find a huge building of the federation of union workers . 
  and those guys are n't exactly poor with their filled bank accounts and 6 million members . 
  i 'm not saying that this excessive lobbying from the industry is n't bad - it certainly is , but i think it 's a fundamental problem of the lack of initiative from unions which do n't work together . 
  nationally oriented unions have simply a different goals than globally working industries . 
  this is obviously going to lead to a huge problem in the future and somebody should come up with a good idea to make national unions step up their game . 
  it 's weird when the german unions put away a quarter billion each year but wo n't help out unemployed people across the border because they are n't germans . 
  sorry for the wall of text . 
  it 's like the famous bush quote `` corporations are people too '' which was completely ripped out of context . 
  reddit as well as the american left 's hatred for republicans is incredibly biased and irrational . 
  just because he phrased it poorly and did n't throw in a usual populist statement like `` dae want to take corporations money ? 
  le true equality only exists if we charge some groups more ! '', 
  it 's probably just as stupid as their definition of liberalism . 
  all those morons who cheer at bush 's claim completely forget that ** corpo ** ration literally means `` body of people '' . 
  that 's why it 's called ** corpo ** rate ** person ** hood . 
  nobody can seriously be that stupid to believe that bush thought that companies are living things buying groceries and going to elections . 
  even if that circlejerk makes it look like he is that stupid . 
  the funny part is that the national militaries actually support that idea . 
  the main enemies of a unified european army , basically a stronger eubg , are the national governments and generally the national arms industries . 
  as long as the public does n't support this idea , heckler & koch , beretta and nexter ( the french state-owned arms manufacturer ) will try to keep the militaries seperated . 
  at the current state those companies have 28 potential european customers . 
  a unified military would increase the competition , especially if governments are going to restrict exports into third countries . 
  the same way that some people look italian or spanish . 
  facial features , hair etc. 
  it 's even possible to notice a difference between people from berlin and people from munich ( at least the older generations ) to a certain extend . 
  while this is obviously problematic in this case , i ca n't wrap my head around how our governments can constitute what 's wrong and what 's right . 
  as the souvereign we have the obligation to preserve democracy and we are also allowed to use deadly force to combat a theoretical european despot but for some reason people who fight against a syrian despot are treated as terrorists ( including secular members of the pyd for example ) . 
  it 's hypocritical to state that fighting for our liberty is constitutional but we do n't allow other people to do the same thing because we do n't agree with their morals . 
  we ca n't generalize militant revolutionaries in the middle-east as terrorists while praising north african militant islamists as heroes . 
  we ca n't claim that killing in the name of republicanism is our right while condemning a muslim who fights for the same republic prefixed by `` islamic '' . 
  covering the heroic acts during the arab spring ca n't be part of our national foreign affairs if we label the revolutionaries as pillaging terrorists . 
  while radical extremism is obviously bad and needs to be stopped , i do n't agree that a government should try to stop people who want to bring democracy to those countries by force . 
  after all many of our countries were established by similar militants who often served in foreign battles before bringing republicanism to their home countries . 
  garibaldi is just one famous example . 
  have you read the article ? 
  it 's about the allies dumping german chemical weapons into the baltic sea . 
  why is it relevant to point out that some ceo has done the same in the 21st century ? 
  by that logic many european countries are n't a `` nation '' . 
  while there are overall similarities between german regions you can generally say that bavaria is very different compared to west-germany or the former prussian territory . 
  add saxony with a highly unique culture and the northern states like hamburg or schleswig-holstein and you have 5 regions which are very unique and are only connected by a territorial border . 
  some parts of switzerland as well as austria could easily be part of the german nation ( as they have been for over 1000 years ) yet they are independent . 
  italy is similar as it 's a pretty young nation with different cultures . 
  the obvious ones are the south and the north but you could say that trentino is just as unique as sardinia or sicily which could easily give you just as many possible `` nations '' . 
  nobody who was born in north-rhine-westphalia would say that they have a prussian heritage . 
  history shows that many regions left of the rhine have always been very close to france or the low countries ( which were part of the broader german nation for a pretty long time as well ) . 
  france on the other hand has been united for a much longer time and managed to establish a reasonably strong french culture yet you have occitania and corsica where seperatist movements are ( have been ) relatively strong . 
  at one point in time every current major country became a nation . 
  generally many multi-nation states broke apart ( yugoslavia , austria-hungary ) and now even the uk might lose a member `` nation '' . 
  but at which point does a `` multi-nation '' become one `` nation '' ? 
  you could always argue that language is a major factor but the scottish nation speaks maily in english . 
  the fact that those regions still try to keep their language/dialect alive is a nice idea but i 'm not sure if you can compare scottish ( which is n't spoken by the majority of the population ) to hungarian . 
  generally , nations get assimilated after a certain time of `` foreign '' rule . 
  aragon became a part of spain just as well as grenada became spanish . 
  i think it 's hard to define a region a nation if it 's not sovereign . 
  while hungary was still a nation ( since it ruled alongside austria to some extend ) the spanish `` nations '' became a fundamental part of the spanish identity after they ceased to exist for over 500 years . 
  i 'm not against a catalonian independence ( or basque ) but a sudden independence is n't going to make that region a nation .
