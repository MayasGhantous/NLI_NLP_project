  yep, 
  do you really think that 16 + year olds from germany stand a chance against a professional army ? 
  90 % of those who travel there to fight die within the first week . 
  they dont speak the language , are not used to the countries society , have never handeled a rifle before , lack general training and often have mental problems .

   you can tweet and share in your social networks so . . the american way , sitting at home , writing cynical comments on facebook that will definitely help, 
   fuck you . 
  shame your ancestors are n't buried in katyn like they should be . 
  every normal person would stop reading there  germans raped and killed many times more soviet citizens than vice versa , and were completely unprovoked , whereas soviet war crimes were a form of revenge against much worse atrocities . 
   meanwhile , the top estimates of soviet rapes in eastern europe are 2 million , and that 's based entirely on abortion statistics after the war , which is nonsensical as abortions were illegal under hitler . 
  the real number is much smaller . 
  the holocoust had 6 million victims , the great leap forward killed ~ 40 million people , after your logic the murdering of these jews was okay because there were other atrocities that were much worse . 
   a form of revenge against much worse atrocities the russians basically had to rape these women , right . 
  killing for revenge doesnt make it better . 
  also , raping polish women not german . 
   an order issued on january 19 , 1945 and signed by stalin said , they still did it and most were left unpunished  in the wehrmacht , however , rape of non-german civilians was not punished in any capacity . 
  were sorry and , unlike you , dont try to deny or bright up our history and play down our role in poland . 
   sorry that my grandparents forced you guys to read and write . 
  being quite familiar with the polish national character , i 'm sure you would have been much happier as chattel slaves for your german masters . 
  what are you , 12 ? 
  or just an angry russian who cant accept that his country was not as great as he was thought in school ? 
  i will assume that youre just a troll and wont reply on any on your comment anymore, 
  you know that the games against the team on the 6th position dont count in the table ? 
  `` because one group has one team fewer than the others , matches against the last-placed team in each of the six-team groups are not included in this ranking . '', 
  so they can be scanned by us and then send to the us yeahh , great ... 
  i `` speak '' four : - german - english , best student - latin , worst student who passed the latin degree - spanish , better than latin, 
  money ? 
  how i hate guido , a stalinist as an honorary member , really ? 
  neoliberale-christsoziale union deutscher trotzkisten f\u00fcr die r\u00fcckeroberung kameruns ncudtfdrk who is with me ? 
  i dont like the 5 % threshold , it should be lowered to 2 % or 3 % , its not like your vote is useless they get 0,70 $ for it but i think its not fair that you keep them out of the parliament, 
  but i hate them all equally, 
  every major town has a `` judengasse '' , '' - strasse '' , '' - markt '' , etc. 
  in germany there are three answers for the question `` do you like david cameron ? '', 
  i like his movies 2 .

  isnt it mandatory to learn at least one language at school ? 
  most pupils here can choose between french , latin , spanish or russian , english is obligatory i speak english , latin and spanish for example, 
  its up to me serious i take things , i laugh and enjoy life unlike poor little adolf here, 
  most of the good doucumentaries would probably be in the language of the country, 
  lets ignore all questions , that will show them that my opinion is better, 
  pff `` fans '' , these people are just there to beat each other up , the bosses of those gangs even meet and organize those brawls they often dont care about the football , they just want to fight, 
  was involved in several civil wars , coups and robbed , murdered and bribed i would call that a disgusting criminal, 
  not necessarily but all those people can easily form parallel societies . 
  in big cities there are people who are unable to speak the language of the country and if the community grows bigger the will to learn the language sinks because the people have their own cinemas , shops , churches , etc. 
  and dont have to interact with the native population, 
  and since when is that a good thing ? 
  [ naaaazi !, 
  nope, 
  we ( at least in my school ) have : 1 . english 2 . french , latin , spanish and then you are able to take another language later , which i did , or intensify your third language, 
  and `` nach paris gehts da lang . '', 
  are a great start  no seriously , how common is it for french to learn german ? 
  most pupils from the high schools ( our gymnasium ) are already learning french , latin or spanish, 
  [ seriously ?

  if anyone could claim him it would be the city of aachen , north rhine-westphalia , germany but as i said `` claiming '' figures from the 8th century is extremely hard vercingetorix is from auvergne in southern france, 
  he was german-french , he was born in aachen and he is buried there , aachen was also his capital and because `` german '' or `` french '' didnt exist back he has no nationality , at least not in the modern sense of it, 
  doesnt gd hate germany and the eu ? 
  why do the play the horst wessel lied then ? 
  no , we dont say that our situation today is great but saying that east germany was better than the brd is just not true, 
  theres always north korea , but wait thats not `` real communism '' and stop denying that east germany is the best state ever they even had to build [ a wall ] ( http://www.grenzbilder.de/images/grenze_bearbeitung/0008_ddr_grenze.jpg ) to keep all the western refugees out, 
  thats why the west germans revolted in 1989 and reunited with the glorious communist utopia that is east germany im german and what youre saying is bullshit . 
  ever were in hohensch\u00f6nhausen ? 
  defending this system is similar to defending auschwitz or tuol sleng, 
  theyre either dead or live happily with their children and grandchildren a trial would not even be possible , just stop it, 
  nice , but turnbeutelvergesser is more about the act of `` forgetting '' your bag so you dont have to train and play with the other kids . 
  also : [ applaus applaus ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsfpdln8fyg ), 
  yeah sure ... 
  true , my great uncle was killed in auschwitz because he made too many jokes about hitler, 
  because debts were paid back and there is an agreement which was made art : not returned , no agreement -  stolen is it really that hard ? 
  we all like it , but shhhhh ...

  deutsche mark -  simply `` mark '' euro is called euro, 
  i dont think you can count the spiegel as a good paper anymore, 
  and then there is me learning spanish, 
  you can hate it from germany . 
  no , youre right, 
  wh . . oh yeah , right, 
  i tell you a secret : i live in the region with the highest breweries/km \u00b2 quota in the world and even my father is a hobby brewer , the problem is ^ ^ i ^ dont ^ like ^ beer how i still live ? 
  i dont know, 
  oh , im not directly from f\u00fcrth , im from oberfranken if you identify yourself as an european so be it and living with interesting people from the uk and paris , awful city in my opinion , must be a great experience for all of you . 
  maybe i change my opinion about my identity if i go to the university myself in one year , time will tell .
