the hatred has arrived in the centre of society . 
  in some countries at least . 
  europ already dealt with the refugee `` crisis '' . 
  what more is there to do to appease people who do n't like immigrants ? 
   the eu is the last bastion of free liberalism in the world why do peolpe always forget latin america ? 
  democracy has also been on the uptake in africa and asia . 
  also , most of those neo-facist movements are dominated by middle aged and old people . 
  as long as the youth stands for democracy and pluralism we should be just fine . 
  the eu sanctions against russia were both quick and a unified response . 
  they also go beyond `` sabre rattling '' if you look at the state of the russian economy . 
  personally i 'm glad no one sent troops to eastern ukraine . 
  i do n't think a proxy war with russia serves the interests of the eu or any of it 's member states . 
   all the hysterical hyperventilating about trump [ ... ] becoming tiresome man , are you in for some tiresome months ( and maybe years ) . 
  while the conservative parallel society in the usa is worrying , let 's not pretend that all people voted for trump for the same reasons . 
  there were definatly quite a few protest votes in this election , espacially in the rust belt , which is what won trump the election ( alongside , possibly , voter suppression ) . 
  i found the [ exit polls ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=0 ) to be interesting , especially the category income wich shows the sharp uptake of republican support among lower and lower middle class people , and the question : `` do you think donald j. trump has the temperament to serve effectively as president ? '', 
  where 20 % of the people who answered no voted for trump . 
  i would suspect there is some overlap here , though i 'm sure the next weeks and months and probably years will se a slew of detailed and contadictory analysises of the 2016 presidential election . 
  i do n't think all left-wingers want open borders . 
  those people exist but most want legal and regulated immigration . 
  well , the relative importance of western europe has declined ever since the end of empire , not that that 's a bad thing . 
  on migration : i think decent politicians have a hard time combating fabricated/imagined issues . 
  on sovereignty : if europe wants to compete with burgeoning and existing superpowers it has to integrate , there 's no other way . 
  if compromise is deemed unacceptable democracy is already dead . 
  other parties as well as independents did and do win elections in the us . 
  your general point still stands though . 
   michel houellebecq prediction for france sometimes i think all that satire does is give people the wrong ideas . 
   ` marriage ' which is of course a religious institution which clearly can not be applied to homosexuals there are several protestant churches who marry same-sex couples , so ... you know , no . 
  i 've seen a burqa once , in a mall in frankfurt . 
  of course public discourse in germany does n't differentiate burqas and niqabs and i do see those around here with some regularity . 
  though i guess they could be tourists . 
  well , we got hundreds of thousands of decent people , most of which want to become productive members of society . 
  that 's well worth a few scumbags . 
  violent extremism is confined to a small subset of islam and is connected to the more regressive and extreme schools of thought , most notably salafism . 
  also , i 'm under the impression that islamic terrorists are not so much concerned with our way of life and more concerned with the power , real or imagined , that western countries wield over the middle east . 
  no , you 're not . 
  i think the takeaway here is that terrorism is at a historic low in europe , except maybe france ( though one bad year does n't make a trend ) . 
  that does n't mean that the attacks that happen are not bad . 
  all it does is add some perspective the next time someone says the end of western civilization is nigh . 
  oh yeah , totally . 
  plenty of left wingers have that kind of knee jerk reaction , i should know , i am one . 
  me personally , i support the governments policy on immigration but it 's not helpful to deny negative consequences . 
  we added hundreds of thousands of people to the population , some of them are criminals , some others will turn to crime . 
  though i think it 's still worth it overall . 
  `` europe '' decided nothing . 
  the german government along with a view others decided to open the gate for syrian refugees . 
  well , let 's look at some statistics . 
  they do n't get up to the last few years , but so far france is the only country with a lot of attacks ( though others might join the club this year ) . 
  here 's a bunch of crime statistics from [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/crime_statistics ) . 
  violent crimes remained at about the same level on most countries , but [ homicides ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:homicides_recorded_by_the_police,_2002%e2%80%9312_yb14.png ) dropped significantly in most countries . 
  here 's data from the [ worldbank ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/vc.ihr.psrc.p5?view=map ) and the almighty [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate_by_decade ) for some long term perspective . 
  of course , how the recent surge in immigration to germany will affect crime remains to be seen . 
  no need for emphasis , i can read just fine . 
  i guess my problem is that saying cultures can have different worth easily leads to saying that people have different worth . 
  and that 's a pretty unenlightened idea . 
  i would certainly agree that europe has many different and diverse cultures . 
  it 's just that , as a `` globalist '' ( i prefer weltb\u00fcrger ) , i do n't think that the european civilization is inherently superior to others . 
  different for sure , maybe even incompatible , but not superior . 
  also , as a side note , i 'm sure you just meant to say `` less developed '' , but `` degenerate cultures '' is literal nazi-speak . 
  you might want to refrase that . 
  it 's kinda the opposite in germany . 
  the recession did n't hit us that hard and the rise of the afd happened mostly in the last two years which saw record increases in wages and the lowest unemployment rates in decades . 
  i would say the refugee `` crisis '' was far more important here . 
  die gr\u00fcnen pretty much fill the roll of a social liberal party in addition to being environmentalists . 
  that 's probably the reason for their widespread appeal . 
  [ liberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_liberalism ) is most certainly rooted in 19th century ideology . 
  though , of course , today it can mean many things to many people . 
  i do n't believe the eu can be reformed , thus i 'll oppose any attempt to reform it . 
  i did wonder about that , too . 
  i think that europeans tend to romanticise the past in a way that other cultures do n't and architecture is one expression of that . 
  one might even call them post-soviet countries . 
  my guess would be that most of them came to lithuania when it was still part of the ussr ? 
  edit : -, 
  i 'm pretty sure `` standard german '' is the usual way to put it . 
  sounds more like niederdeutsch to me . 
  we have n't seen any evidence on that , yet . 
  never heard that before . 
  world war 3 : the memening, 
  nonetheless the government has to negotiate with the eu how exactly to go about leaving and more importantly what happens afterwards . 
  well , he did n't send murder squads into the ghettos ... yet . 
  the title is wrong . 
  the participating countries are denmark , netherlands and germany . 
   we will breed and grow regardless on how crowded we are that 's just plain not true . 
  there is a very strong correlation between economic development and fertiliyty rate . 
  in fact most countries are now around replacement rate and many are below that including very populous one like the us , brazil and china . 
  that 's an easy to google fact . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_total_fertility_rate ) have a wikipedia article about it . 
  i guess the allies had their reasons to abolish prussia after the war . 
  i 'd say they were mostly successful , too . 
  i think to most people its just a historic country , part of some long gone german history . 
  except the part this thread is about , northern east prussia . 
  i guess the idea here is that there could have been a jewish state in east prussia . 
  that state would been a soviet vassal state since this part of europe was designated as part of the soviet sphere of influence by the allies . 
  i doubt that would have been more successful then the jewish autonomous oblast . 
  that seems kinda ... random . 
  why prussia ? 
  and palestine was a suitable place for a jewish home state . 
  also , i 'm not sure jews would have wanted to live in the ussr . 
  i would n't say that german electricity generation is unstainable nor is it unsustainable . 
  there were some mismanagement with the transition to renewable energy that the geovernment tries to fix now .
