but it makes no sense . 
  do you mean the csu ? 
  it 's the sister party of the cdu ( merkel ) . 
  the csu is exclusive to bavaria and they represent interests of bavaria on a federal level but they are in no way a separatist party . 
  they are actually a good opposition to the left parties in my opinion . 
  yeah but it 's nothing serious . 
  how generous . 
  that guy throwing his blue synthetic jacket ... yep that will help . 
  ( it actually makes it worse ), 
  but still . . set yourself on fire makes no sense, 
  oh the memories ... 2:01 bruce lee always gets me . 
  b\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4m, 
  i have the same opinion . 
  nuclear power is still necessary but not the holy grail . 
  but man you are gb is n't it windy as fuck at your place ? 
  i just would n't shove tax money in the nuclear lobby 's asses . 
  the truth is they privatize profits and socialize losses . 
  look at the banks . 
  before the crisis they made huge profits and suddenly they were crying for help and the governments had to rescue them with billions of $ / # / $ . 
  in my opinion water , energy , healthcare , infrastructure should be in the hand of the state . 
  i heard the whole thing costs 19-30bn $, 
  no it 's ridicolous to subsidize hpc ( for expample ) . 
  the only winner here is the nuclear power lobby ( companies ) . 
  or do you think the regular people have anything from that ? 
  that tax money is gone . 
  they will never pay anything back but they will call when they need to get rid of the nuclear wastes that 's for sure . 
  ok but why is it even necessary to school your kid at home ? 
  also i ca n't imagine how it would have been if i were schooled at home . 
  i made all my friends in school and before that in kindergarten . 
  kids need to dispute ( right word ? ), 
  with other kids . 
  i can imagine that the other kids see you somehow different . 
  not like them . 
  well you said it 's probably better . 
  i do n't see how that is better and i also dont see why it is like it is now bad . 
  yeah but this kicked off the discussion . 
  how you make sure the children getting told the right things at home ? 
  how do you enforce the standards when you do n't know what happens at home ? 
  actually the eu allowed gb to subsidize hpc . 
  right ? 
  i was wrong . 
  i admit that . 
  not long ago it was a big thing in our media . 
  there was a sect that did n't want their children go to public school . 
  even a sek team ( swat ) was involved . 
  ( [ translated spiegel article ) ] ( https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fschulspiegel%2fschulpflicht-kinder-der-sekte-zwoelf-staemme-gehen-nicht-zur-schule-a-969559.html&amp;edit-text= ), 
  also experiments ( chemestry , biology etc ) are not really possibly because you have usually no equipment for that at home or it 's not allowed to have it . 
  did the parents schooled him or a teacher ? 
  you ninja edited your post ... 
  source ? 
  the result is the same . 
  i do n't know how that changes anything . 
  all that while receiving billions subsidies for the new nuclear plant hinkley point c. 
  is n't it like this already ? 
  germany , france , gb pay the most, 
  you should also read the comments on zeit.de if you like dem giggles, 
  nice video , thanks . 
  itt : everything dubbed is hitler . 
  and iceland, 
  sweet green tea, 
  oh really ? 
  i thought it was real . 
  many djs and producers of electronic music come from europe . 
  cars/1000 would be more interesting . 
  ( for me ), 
   ( geographical ), 
  spreading cancer since 1898, 
  only the western suburbs of istanbul ( geographical ), 
  they use different sausage meat . 
  first you scald the face or whatever and then you put it in the other sausage meat . 
  exactly . 
  what if you disagree with politics ? 
  or biology ... what if you believe god created the world and all creatures ? 
  tl ; dr a warmonger urges another warmonger . 
  what do you think about the fact that it is/was only run by anglo-saxons ? 
  complot ? 
  ** european parliament . 
  report from 11 july 2001 **  the existence of a global system for intercepting private and commercial communications ( the ** echelon ** interception system )   a. 
  ** whereas the existence of a global system for intercepting communications , operating by means of cooperation proportionate to their capabilities among the usa , the uk , canada , australia and new zealand under the ukusa agreement , is no longer in doubt ** ; whereas it seems likely , in view of the evidence and the consistent pattern of statements from a very wide range of individuals and organisations , including american sources , that its name is in fact echelon , although this is a relatively minor detail ,   b. whereas there can now be no doubt that the purpose of the system is to intercept , at the very least , private and commercial communications , and not military communications , although the analysis carried out in the report has revealed that the technical capabilities of the system are probably not nearly as extensive as some sections of the media had assumed ,   c. whereas , therefore , it is surprising , not to say worrying , that many senior community figures , including european commissioners , who gave evidence to the temporary committee claimed to be unaware of this phenomenon , http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=report&amp;reference=a5-2001-0264&amp;format=xml&amp;language=en, 
  religion is not a race . 
  yep . 
  british english here in germany too . 
  the world was just not ready for them . 
  munich amsterdam st. petersburg venice barcelona, 
  this show is so stupid . 
  those are surely great pieces of literature but not that much joy to read nowadays in my opnion ( for the average joe ), 
  of course . 
  there is also a video game ( rpg ) which is really really good . 
  `` die unendliche geschichte '' by michael ende ( `` the never ending story '' ) `` krabat '' by otfried preu\u00dfler ( `` krabat '' ) `` das parfum '' by patrick s\u00fc\u00dfkind ( `` parfume '' ) those are all available in other languages, 
  because the `` stock '' - manufactures build nice cars . 
  the only tuning i like is nice alu rims and wider tires and a discreet bodykit preferably in black . 
  schmidt would be number 1 in germany if you count schmid , schmitt etc. 
  and meyer number 2 if you count mayer etc. 
  eating gouda will never be the same again . 
  true but i talk about the people . 
  the number of people who are against this bullshit in germany is rising every day . 
  millions and millions were protesting ? 
  that 's new, 
  i do n't see the majority protesting in other european countries as well just a few 100 or few 1000 . 
  so everyone is a `` refugees welcome '' guy according to your logic .
