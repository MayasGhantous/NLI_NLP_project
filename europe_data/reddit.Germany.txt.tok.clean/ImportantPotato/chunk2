  it 's not germany . 
  it 's just these mentally ill guys, 
  yazidas for example cause the same problems and they are not even muslim . 
  if yezidas marry a non yazida they get expelled from their religion which is a huge hindrance for integration . 
  ( and this is just one aspect ), 
  one job for example is to sit in the bus all day and help older and disabled people to get in/out and finde a seat for them etc. 
  why is that ? 
  simultaneous interpreter ? 
  shut the fuck up herr gabriel, 
  you ever heard someone screaming `` oh my god '' while firing a gun ? 
  ( soldiers in afghanistan for example ), 
  our conservatives ( cdu ; merkels party ) are not really conservatives anymore . 
  ( nuclear phase-out , asylum policy etc. ), 
  that does n't make sense to me but it 's your sub . 
  why is liveleak banned ?

  i want more !, 
  debt relief + grexit would have been the best solution for greece . 
  grexit does n't mean they are out of the eu or even europe . 
  the currency is just too strong for them to be able to compete on the export market . 
  this decision should have been made before the 3rd bail-out package though or even in 2008 or before . 
  now be burnt billions of euros for nothing because the money hinders them to make structural reforms because they now know they get the money anyway . 
  we also have the debt union now which means every country gets a bailout if they are in trouble . 
  look at italy they have the highest debt after greece and prime minister renzi just announced that he will reduce taxes because he knows when shit hits the fan other euromembers ( germany , netherlands , austria etc ) have to bailout italy . 
  the eurotrain will derail sooner or later and cause a desaster if we do n't change anything . 
  poland stronk, 
  how dare you, 
  here is a pic of him http://i.imgur.com/ytaobso.jpg, 
  according to spiegel and germanwings the plane had the newest computers on board and the crew was very experienced . 
  remove kebab done right, 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  because it 's the only place where it 's not a repost . 
  nationalistic = / = fascist, 
  i have a question . 
  the russians ( media , politicans ) always claim the ukrainians are fascists or the fascists want to fight them . 
  are there actualy any fascist `` forces '' ( or parties ) involved ? 
  i see these cars allday . 
  what happened ? 
  ( also alfa make pretty cool cars these days ), 
  my dsl and mobile is from o2 owned by telefonica . 
  blasto from mass effect, 
  `` give me money or i 'll hurt myself '', 
  look at these naive liberals helping these criminals . 
  just throw your passport away, 
  people can only be so generous before they start to believe they are being taken advantage of . 
  letting in refugees trying to escape war and famine is fine , but there 's only so much and so many one country can handle before it puts a burden on its own people and in turn starts to drag them down . 
  yup , they are literally subhumans ... oh wait, 
  it 's an ostrich egg . 
  it 's not their fault . 
  they are traumatized by the asylum crisis . 
  yes with people receiving hartziv . 
  ( social benefits ), 
  i wonder if he also got 4x the benefits . 
  no , mongolia . 
  good, 
  not anymore . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ reichtangle ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ rise ^ ^ ^ ^ again, 
  kebab calzone is better . 
  being in every second polandball comic, 
  the illuminati are real !, 
  if you want so ... yes, 
  leftwing idiots . 
  do n't listen to them and their crude ideas . 
  people told you ? 
  who exactly ? 
  i just wanted to say we are in the same boat . 
  we do n't want her either . 
  you still think it was just a clock ? 
   true , but ** the germans ** elected her i did n't vote for her . 
  it was a sarcastic comment by me . 
  history matters ? 
  let 's talk about the uk history now . 
  but hey i 'm sure you do n't have a single skeleton in the closet , right ? 
  you and the estonian guy are hypocrites . 
  thanks . 
  tell me about his valid point !, 
  `` who you have murdered and dominated in the past ! '', 
  how is that even relevant in these days ? 
  my generation has nothing to do with this !, 
  you piece of shit would be under soviet government if we did n't have wwii so stop mime the wise man here estonian boy . 
  you are delusional . 
  i hope you wake up in time . 
  oh there comes the nazi card . 
  go creep back to your fucking shithole country . 
  thanks . 
  iraq , spying , policies in general etc. 
   they do n't need us telling them how to do it . 
  implying you know how to do `` it '', 
  the uk is a puppet of the us . 
  having uk in the eu ensures us influence . 
  ( the german government is also a puppet of the us though . 
  see nsa / nuclear weapons in germany ), 
  i hope it crashes very soon . 
  merkel is delusional and out of her mind . 
  she is the most dangerous politican in europe right now and needs to be stopped . 
  from the rational thinking people left in this country to all of our remaining friends in europe : ** please help us to stop this madness ** ( i do n't know how exactly tbh but everything opposing merkel helps hopefully ),
