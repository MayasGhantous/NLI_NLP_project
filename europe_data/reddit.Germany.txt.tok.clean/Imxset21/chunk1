that 's great that it worked out for you , hopefully these children will be able to make an informed decision to that effect once they 're consenting adults . 
   holy crap man it 's just your dick - stop thinking so much about what it `` could have been '' and worry about more important things . 
  `` hey , stop caring about things you care about !, 
  focus on the more important things that i tell you to care about ! '', 
  so if there was some benefit found in chopping off parts of a child 's ear , then we should allow it indiscriminately without consideration for the child 's right to bodily integrity ? 
  i was n't comparing the two in terms of consequences or direct damage or pain . 
  i was saying that :  i feel like if you ban it theyre still gon na do it is not a good argument because it leaves open the door for allowing things like fgm ( `` they 're just going to do fgm anyway , so we should n't ban it . '' ), 
  also , i do n't appreciate the personal insult , buddy . 
  so we should also not bother outlawing female genital mutilation , then ? 
   at this point , my wife and i kinda regret our decision . 
  it seems most people just do n't have a `` well , it is what it is '' but instead if you 're cut then your parents are mutilating barbarians ? 
  it 's almost as if people object to permanently removing part of a child 's genitals without their consent for very little benefit . 
  who would 've thought ? 
  do n't worry my romanian comrade , mother russia will soon free you from the shackles of fascism . 
  for your own good , of course . 
  i ca n't speak to / u/localtoast but for me it was a combination of factors . 
  primarily was the problem that as a comedic subreddit it held humor above all else ; this became problematic when there were legitimate historical problems or misconceptions or just downright wrongness with the author 's presentation of the joke , because the standard that the content was held to was simple `` is it funny ( y/n ) . '', 
  this was coupled , oddly enough , with stringent rules and standards on submission quality , style guidelines , and transient rules ( the joke life preserve ) that temporarily banned or restricted content based on what the community voted to be old or stale jokes . 
  while this kept a lot of the more mainstream annoying misconceptions at bay ( for instance , the `` french suck at fighting '' trope ) it ultimately does not help prevent the content from becoming repetitive or any less filled with misconceptions . 
  this duality of `` we take our artistic standards seriously '' versus `` we do n't take the historical content seriously , it 's just a joke '' is at the core of the subreddit 's value proposition . 
  this is best showcased by the fact that there were many talented artists who created entire pseudohistorical series or miniseries of comics relating to historical periods and events , for instance the violent nordic conflicts of the middle ages . 
  though this helped bring to the fore historical events that are relatively unknown outside of the nations involved , in the end these are comics written usually from one perspective and , as stated above , for the ultimate purpose of entertainment . 
  this meant that you had a somewhat confusing blend of historical humor conflated with historical fact which can be problematic when the subject matter has direct parallels or consequences to current controversies and politics . 
  it was not uncommon to see many charges of `` butthurtness '' in the comment sections when particularly annoying or damaging stereotypes or misconceptions were pointed out . 
  ultimately i left because i realized that it was impossible for me to reconcile the fact that the main comedic draw of the subreddit was to play on national stereotypes and biased representations of historical events for humor with the notion that these comics could actually provide some kind of educational content or starting point of discussion as an art form . 
  the issue is the fact that the subreddit as a whole seems to want to have its cake and eat it too ; the grandiose historical sagas are taken to be truthful when it suits them , and hilariously inaccurate when criticized ( `` it 's just a joke , do n't take it seriously '' ) . 
  in the final analysis this results in an intractable environment for any kind of serious discussion . 
  tl ; dr they want to have their cake ( be taken seriously as an art form by having stringent guidelines on content ) and eat it too ( giving artists immunity from criticism under the `` it 's just a joke ! '', 
  defense ) . 
  if they want to be take as seriously as their artistic standards imply , then they have to let go of the idea that you can use humor as a shield from criticism . 
  what if this is actually all an elaborate plan by russian europhiles to create an european federation by giving it a strong existential external threat in the form of an aggressive russian state ? 
  it 's the jewlluminati / s, 
  i just hope that * if * it comes to that ( and i hope it does n't ) germany does not try to weasle its way out of coming to latvia 's aid . 
  the way the government has handled the ukraine so far has led me to believe it might be even more spineless than i had thought . 
  you should be careful , if you keep oppressing those russian minorities , you may also find yourself fighting russian paratro - i mean , oppressed freedom fighters with `` found '' russian military gear . 
  hopefully your jimmies will be the only thing the russians rustle ... 
  called your opposition `` tyrannical '' is rather ironic when the sort of rethoric your espousing would mean that as long as a democratic majority votes for something then it should be valid . 
  this means that minority rights can easily be justifiably eliminated as long as it follows `` the will of the people . '', 
  this is why , amongst other things , civil law judicial systems are not democratic . 
  what you 're suggesting is not democracy , it 's rule by a mob . 
  it 's still possible to have a ground war without involving nuclear weapons . 
  it just means that the war ca n't escalate to the point where one side faces an existential threat , because that 's the most likely scenario for when they would be used . 
  i also met a female version of thor , except she was named `` thora . '', 
  yeah , those foreign aid workers and journalists should definitely be more careful about where they choose to work . 
  / s it 's pretty disgusting that we 're blaming victims for being abducted/kidnapped by terrorists . 
  wait a second ... 
  your statement does n't seem to line up with the facts : http://mg.co.za/article/2013-10-10-are-sa-whites-really-being-killed-like-flies do you have a source for your assertion ? 
  perhaps you should follow your username 's advice ... 
  it 's funny because it 's more like a hegelian dialectic than anything else , which is much more arts than engineering . 
  but it turns out that it works for many discussion formats . 
   how would you define `` success '' ? 
  a lot of measures , including gdp per capita , [ which sweden ranks 13th in the world in ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2013&amp;ey=2013&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=16&amp;pr1.y=7&amp;c=512%2c668%2c914%2c672%2c612%2c946%2c614%2c137%2c311%2c962%2c213%2c674%2c911%2c676%2c193%2c548%2c122%2c556%2c912%2c678%2c313%2c181%2c419%2c867%2c513%2c682%2c316%2c684%2c913%2c273%2c124%2c868%2c339%2c921%2c638%2c948%2c514%2c943%2c218%2c686%2c963%2c688%2c616%2c518%2c223%2c728%2c516%2c558%2c918%2c138%2c748%2c196%2c618%2c278%2c522%2c692%2c622%2c694%2c156%2c142%2c624%2c449%2c626%2c564%2c628%2c565%2c228%2c283%2c924%2c853%2c233%2c288%2c632%2c293%2c636%2c566%2c634%2c964%2c238%2c182%2c662%2c453%2c960%2c968%2c423%2c922%2c935%2c714%2c128%2c862%2c611%2c135%2c321%2c716%2c243%2c456%2c248%2c722%2c469%2c942%2c253%2c718%2c642%2c724%2c643%2c576%2c939%2c936%2c644%2c961%2c819%2c813%2c172%2c199%2c132%2c733%2c646%2c184%2c648%2c524%2c915%2c361%2c134%2c362%2c652%2c364%2c174%2c732%2c328%2c366%2c258%2c734%2c656%2c144%2c654%2c146%2c336%2c463%2c263%2c528%2c268%2c923%2c532%2c738%2c944%2c578%2c176%2c537%2c534%2c742%2c536%2c866%2c429%2c369%2c433%2c744%2c178%2c186%2c436%2c925%2c136%2c869%2c343%2c746%2c158%2c926%2c439%2c466%2c916%2c112%2c664%2c111%2c826%2c298%2c542%2c927%2c967%2c846%2c443%2c299%2c917%2c582%2c544%2c474%2c941%2c754%2c446%2c698%2c666&amp;s=ppppc&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) . 
  i do n't understand what your comment that `` sweden 's gdp per capita is quite high , but it 's not the top '' means in that respect . 
  13th out of 187 is pretty good , even successful . 
   sweden is one of the most left-wing , communist-ridden places in the world . 
  i do n't understand why `` left-wing '' is necessarily not successful . 
  do you mean to say that only centrist and right-wing governments are successful ? 
  also , could you clarify what you mean by `` communist-ridden '' ? 
  the swedish communist party only has 6 of 12,978 municipalities . 
  also , regarding other potential measures of success : * [ sweden ranked 7th in university of leicester 's `` world happiness index '' based on various measures ( old study from 2006 ) ] ( http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-07/uol-uol072706.php ) * [ sweden ranked 6th in social progress index ( 2013 , pdf warning ) .

  ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/14/hdr2013_en_complete.pdf ) i 'm not saying any of these are definitive , or that sweden is a place without problems , but unlike you , i can comprehend why the swedish public is approving of what they do , given these results . 
  this poll 's methodology is n't really the best . 
  if you want a more nuanced , complete version of opinions about the eu , this recent pew research report is more reliable : http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/a-fragile-rebound-for-eu-image-on-eve-of-european-parliament-elections/, 
  why is there such a hard shift to the left ? 
  you could post a picture of yourself to dispel those misconceptions . 
  you know , for science . 
  as much as the eu screws some things up and could improve in some areas , it 's still one of the better institutions we have . 
  hey man i do n't make the rules i just report them . 
  there was/is a particular american rapper whose fans refer to him as `` based god . '', 
  the phrase has spread to mean that something is of superlative quality . 
  i believe the redditor you are replying to is trying to say that these proposed reforms are to his liking . 
  sure thing buddy . 
  it was at the top of / r/bestof not too long ago . 
  [ happy reading !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2026bq/reduce_the_workweek_to_30_hours_nyt/cfzlgiw ), 
  i take it you also read that post on / r/programming about the it 80 hour work week ? 
  not to mention its various botched hostage rescue operations , like the beslan school shootings . 
  you think an embargo is imminent ? 
  that 's because , as certain artistic subreddits with a proclivity towards spheres have repeatedly demonstrated , france is the country everyone loves to hate ( tm ) . 
  is it cynical of me to think that russia has a vested interest in keeping ukraine out of the eu for what they see as reasons of security and economics ? 
  even if that goes against what is best for the ukranian people ? 
  ( and i do n't profess to know what that is , by the way ), 
  are you safe , at least , in case something serious happens ? 
  for governments , non profits , and general use i would still say firefox is best ( not necessarily performance wise or feature wise , even though it 's fairly competitive ) because it 's open source , free , and cross platform . 
  ie is only the second , chrome only the last two ( though the chromium project is oss ) . 
  it 's funny because your flair indicates you 're referring to either the netherlands or hungary but in either case that statement is correct . 
  if you look at the flair of the guy i replied to , it says `` north portugal is best portugal '', 
  is this everywhere in portugal or only in `` best portugal '' i.e. 
  north portugal ? 
  unsurprisingly no one i know is voting for npd , thank god . 
  thank you for not using potato joke . 
  the `` history '' part definitely reads like common hungarian nationalism , you are correct . 
  east germany , i think . 
  also austria is dumb / s, 
  well , you * are * posting in what appears to be devolving into an european cookoff competition . 
  all that delicious food ... 
  it 's interesting you say that , because i had a girlfriend who was polish and made the same distinctions . 
  her family is from szczecin , and self-identified more as `` germanized poles '' rather than `` 100 % polish '' ( their words ) . 
   we should also standardise things an bit are you sure you meant to put poland as your flag , not germany ?
