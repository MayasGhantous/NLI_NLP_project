  but yes , this is necessary . 
  we have fine moderators in this sub , it 's only fair if we actually use them for you know , moderating content . 
  awww , we love you too < 3, 
  ... that game never happened . 
  obviously is croatian propaganda film , look at how grany it is !, 
  ( is kidding , was funny , i was not expecting to see this posted ), 
  but you are croatian , you should have been born living with high hopes and constant disappointment .

   downgeloaded oh my god this is genius , how have i not heard of this ? 
  you do n't have a flag , so mind telling us your nationality ? 
  or flairing up ? 
  ... [ * slow clap * ], 
  you are most likely correct . 
  it 's times like these where i feel very sad about the direction the uk is going in . 
  a wonderful country and culture , being ran into the ground . 
  apparently word on / r/unitedkingdom is that subreddits like / r/sex and / r/lgbt ( the former of which is used to discuss sexual health , the latter of which has virtually no nsfw content ) are in danger of being shafted by this . 
  it 's a shame , really . 
   i 'm just wondering how anyone living in this world would be surprised that the huge city that is paris has very busy air traffic . 
  if city size correlated with air traffic , then that would be a reasonable assumption . 
  [ however , a look at the world 's busiest city airports shows that this is not the case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world%27s_busiest_city_airport_systems_by_passenger_traffic ) ; denver , atlanta , chicago , miami are all relatively small cities when compared to paris or beijing , but are still much higher on the list than much larger cities such as toronto or berlin or beijing . 
  there is a lot of complexity and nuance in this . 
  paris is , and has been , largely the exception to most european capitals in the world . 
  if i recall correctly ( and as i 'm sure are well aware of ) france has always been extremely centralized around paris since the 16th century . 
  but outside of paris , london and rome , european national capitals have not always been hubs of power , political or otherwise . 
  your explanation does account for how paris ' airport is busy , but it is neither immediate or obvious given the history of development of aeronautical infrastructure . 
  this is not an attempt to discredit paris ' paramount importance to french or western european commerce and business ( and but a cursory glance at la defense would do away with such a notion altogether ) . 
  i am sorry if i offended you . 
  i was not thinking in terms of passenger traffic , but in terms of [ cargo traffic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world%27s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic ) . 
  i was aware that the various parisian airports shuttle a lot of tourists , but a large number of tourist travelers does not by itself a busy airport make . 
  frankfurt , for instance , is considered an extremely busy airport for its size , but the bulk of its traffic is cargo ( very close to cdg 's volume ) and in total it served 30 million less passengers than cdg last year . 
  besides , why would you take issue with my surprise ? 
  wow , i did n't know cdg was * that * busy . 
  do n't forget about driving him to commit suicide . 
  or we might have to lock you in the basement again , 
  yeah , i agree , they 're much funnier and attractive than those austrians . 
  i am 1789 % okay with more french people on / r/europe . 
  goddamn filthy belgians and their incomprehensibly good beer , ruining / r/europe for the rest of us . 
  / s kidding , i 'm sure most everyone loves belgium anyways ( except , of course , for the belgians ) . 
  i 'm sure that there are some tories that would frame it as such in order to pander to euro-skeptics . 
  `` look at those romanian cops , wandering our streets and raping our women !, 
  it 's the eu 's fault they 're here ! '', 
  thank you for that . 
  with reddit 's abysmal search feature i 'm surprised no one has attempted to collect and curate quality reddit posts such as yours in a non-bestof non-sensationalist manner ( i guess a museum of reddit ? 
  that sounds pretty cool . 
  do you have an abstract you could throw at us ? 
  or at least your bibliography , that would be nice to look at to get better informed about this . 
  also , i 'm surprised you do n't seem offended by mr. notsurewhatdayitis ' condescension towards your being australian . 
  seems somewhat ... imperial of him . 
  obviously this is a british english conspiracy to collect more data from us europeans . 
  the best part is that nowhere in the article does herr augstein use `` 1984 '' or `` orwell '' or anything related to that specific work . 
  wow . 
  is ireland really that bad ? 
  i always thought you guys were all sunshine and rainbows ( as much as you can get in ireland , i suppose ) ever since the good friday agreement in the 90s ... 
  you could pull an american and give parents a choice of irish versus the other languages . 
  would you rather that they did n't learn irish at all ? 
  i 'm not posturing , just curious . 
  why would you drink beer in france ? 
  that 's like drinking wine in finland . 
  this is is great from a political/economic perspective , but us in the computational neuroscience community are extremely skeptical that this line of work will really yield anything close to an accurate model of the human brain , as is the whole point of the human brain project . 
  one of the many issues with this `` more power/more data '' approach lies with the fact that structure does not predict function . 
  knowing where cells are , or how they are clustered , or even the number of channels they have is insufficient in predicting how those cells fire in a network . 
  this is also coupled with the fact that some things like learning ( via synaptic weight change over time , etc. 
  ) , neurogenesis , etc. 
  are extremely important mechanisms to how particular neurons ( and thus , particular networks ) function , and these occur over much larger timescales than would be feasible to model in the machinery katrin amunts has proposed . 
  it 's not a new thing in science for these large projects to get a lot of media attention only because of the scale of the resources involved . 
  the human genome project , for instance , was extremely valuable in allowing medical researchers access to the locations of genes and thus allowed for further research into specific expression patterns of those genes . 
  however , it never directly provided us with any information regarding how the expression of those genes . 
  it 's a similar situation in protein folding research , as well . 
  knowing the chemical makeup of particular proteins is helpful , but ultimately it does not predict the folded structure of the protein even 50 % of the time . 
  tl ; dr this is good , but within the scope of the human brain project they 're exaggerating how actually useful this data will be . 
  well , according to our dear frau merkel , we should be exploring some neuland soon ... 
  from / u/countvontroll 's [ post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1gs555/series_what_do_you_know_about_switzerland/canb3fe ) above yours :  fun fact : there are more minarets on this poster ( 7 ) than there are in switzerland ( 4 ) . 
  i went to that subreddit and i seriously thought i was in / r/ussr . 
  you could be a native german speaker and spend 2 years in switzerland and * still * have no fucking idea what a swiss person is talking about . 
  40.00 kr ( 5.36 $ ) for a 0.5 l beer , compared to 3.00 $ here in heidelberg . 
  and i thought us germans made bad jokes ... thankfully our government picks up the slack by being one . 
  considering that only yesterday ( after many years and huge amounts of evidence ) the constitutional courts rejected berlusconi 's 2nd final appeal for tax evasion , i think it will take a very long time . 
  how wonderfully ironic that the most private/paranoid country is the one most snooped on . 
  that 's interesting . 
  perhaps i will have to read the manual again about what it means to be manly , obviously i 've forgotten . 
  do n't forget lazy , unionized labor , the highest taxes on the planet , and something something farm subsidies . 
  at least that 's what i get from uk press . 
  can we please stop citing xkcd like it 's the be-all and end-all of rational discourse ? 
  it 's obviously not the case here and it does n't contribute anything to the conversation . 
  why is that strange ? 
  france has the largest european standing army , they need to be doing something with it . 
  this sounds interesting . 
  are there any instances of this being implemented currently ? 
  what proof do you have that they are `` natural '' ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  deutsche telekom really needs to get broken up . 
  why is germany flashing ? 
  first does not mean most influential . 
  my english always feels like two steps front , two steps back . 
  when i was a gymnasiast this was not the case for me . 
  it was explicitly labeled british english , and i never learned the alternative ( i.e. 
  american ) spellings until later in life . 
  yeah , because i 'd much rather be living under robespierre than sarkozy . 
  i hope you 're not seriously suggesting that french culture and society in the past were universally better .
