  happy cakeday !, 
  upvotes for everyone , especially you . 
  yup , this is / r/europe alright . 
  yes , we will be of missing you most dearly . 
  that was sarcasm . 
   austrian  handwriting you mean `` scrawl , '' right ? 
  not sarcastic , / r/europe is one of my favorite subs . 
  i do n't always see mod posts on / r/europe . 
  when i do , it 's telling americans to pretend they 're canadian . 
  top job moderating this subreddit , by the way . 
  have you considered using your mind-reading powers for good ? 
  without further research that 's hard to pinpoint . 
  however , i would suggest an alternative hypothesis ; what if a person who lives to 80 only has 5 years of intense need because of their good health up to that point , but a person who lives to 75 needs 10 years of intensive care due to diseases acquired from pollution/etc . 
  and poisoning most of the world with it . 
  sorry , i just had lunch and his comment upset my stomach . 
   edit : let the downvotes rain down . 
  i have nothing to fear because i 'm telling the truth . 
  this is just over-dramatic . 
  please do n't put this in your comment , it makes you sound like you think you 're some kind of martyr . 
  i need more slovenian ( s ) in my life . 
  slovenia is nice , and i like you , but this is just insane . 
   ( except uk ) topkek, 
  us germans feel the same way ... 
  it would also imply they 're not sheep , which is inaccurate for wales . 
  man , your country has such entertaining politics . 
  shame you have to live there . 
  were you implying that you thought that poland can into nuclear war ? 
  see : obama . 
  actually , if you think about layers of beurocracy , leaving a federal union ( e.g. 
  catalonia leaving spain ) to join the eu eliminates one layer of bureaucracy ( i.e. 
  catalonia -  spain -  eu to catalonia -  eu ), 
  someone 's been browsing / r/polandball ... 
  hey guys could we , umm , not mention ^ that ^ thing ^ again ^ please, 
  this is completely unrelated , but why do the dutch have so many belgian jokes ? 
  for instance , mein friend recently me told :  when a belgian terrorist wanted to blow up a bus he burned his mouth on the exhaust pipe . 
  is there any particular reason for this ? 
  sorry , english is not my first language . 
  edited above . 
  and the cynic in me tells me you 're seeing a connection based on your preconceptions of the topic . 
  wish we could get this by state . 
  i wonder what popular opinion is like in bayern compared to nrw , where the original court case took place . 
  having dealt with the us dept of education personally , i can say officially that the diplom is considered equivalent to an american master 's degree . 
  however , when it comes to american universities , it varies fairly widely ... 
  well , in america `` liberal '' is `` gauche '' , `` conservative '' is `` droite '' . 
  if you add the adjectives `` social '' or `` economic '' in front of each , then you get the 4 corners of the american political spectrum . 
  for the sake of simplicity and completion of this study i considered `` liberal '' to be equivalent to `` mostly holds what can be considered as positions associated with the political left '' and `` conservative '' to be equivalent to `` mostly holds what can be considered as positions associated with the political right . '', 
  it seems this study was written by an american . 
  was looking for this . 
  interesting . 
  they do have a good point ; banning of the practice in the past has not led to its demise . 
  you have to admit , though , comparing this to the holocaust is a bit extreme . 
  i would like him to suggest that perhaps it 's time that they re-evaluated their religious customs to be more in line with modern sensibilities and the rights of the children they wish to circumcise against their will . 
  what channel was this ? 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't get zdf in the us so i rely on deustche welle for my news from home . 
  you say that , but :  `` a ban on circumcision poses an ** existential question ** for the jewish community in germany , '' the president of the organization , rabbi pinchas goldschmidt , said on thursday . 
  according to him it sounds like they 're in danger of being exterminated or expelled from germany :  `` if the ruling is allowed to stand , then ** i do n't see a future for jews in germany . 
  direct quote from the conference of european rabbis ' president pinchas goldschmidt :  ** `` worst attack on jewish life since the holocaust '' ** [ source ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/european-jewish-leaders-lambast-german-circumcision-ruling-a-844128.html ) . 
  what 's so significant about 1814 in particular that it delineates the start of your period of study ? 
  what is your master 's thesis , anyways ? 
  as a scientist and interested layperson i have to say that eurostat is a fucking godsend for kleine facts like this one . 
  the closest na has to it is the gallup organization , which i still find not as good . 
  `` divide and conquer '' best describes the us ' approach towards political bullying when it comes to patent and copyright protection . 
  if europe wants to resist its advances , then we need to establish a unified front of political pressure against it , and that requires a proper political eu . 
  but if you want to say it in a ghetto american gospel voice , then does that mean that , contrary to your username , you actually * do * give a shit ?

  any day you do n't get asked if you 're a nazi in america is a rare day . 
  what do you think , anecdotally ? 
  do the people you know think independence now is a good idea ? 
  what 's the general sentiment ? 
   oh , and it also is n't germany  oh , so the whole holy roman empire thing meant * nothing * to you ?!? 
  ; _ ; * sniff sniff *, 
   is it uncool now , not to be good little flag waving europeans ? 
  i downvoted you because i resent the unwarranted implication . 
  funny you say that , considering that your national team apparently ca n't control their violent urges when they 're getting their asses kicked . 
  i thought it was going to be a karate match last night , not football . 
  what do you think about poland ? 
  there are * a lot * of germans in here ... [ insert national-socialist pun here ], 
  would you care to provide some sources ? 
  my god ... that actually makes sense . 
  i just hope that you are correct , for all of our sakes . 
   so keep on with your hate against the british , and forget who it was who fought and liberated you all from those who tried to form a united europe in the past . 
  seriously ? 
  implying the eu is equivalent to what ? 
  napoleon 's empire ? 
  national-socialist germany ? 
  i 'm unfamiliar with the nuances of the italian unification ( all i know from history is garibaldi garibaldi garibaldi ) . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i see a lot of parallels to this and the unification of germany in the late 1800s/the american colonies in the 1700s . 
  the two biggest factors tempering the change are the greater political/cultural/linguistic differences and the lack of some momentous military conflict . 
  do norway 's regulations about animal slaughter apply to factory farms as well ? 
  because this dutch measure does n't affect factory farms ' methods , i think . 
  this is one of the few times i would support an eu-led coup in a `` democratic '' country . 
  looks like those birds got caught in a * sticky situation * !, 
  i have to ask , how do you feel emotionally about this , as an italian ? 
  spare me the arguments , i just want to know your gut reaction to knowing the shit berlusconi has gotten away with . 
  wait a second , if these irregularities are accounted for , then is n't this money actually not lost due to irregularities , but returned to the eu common budget by having been detected as fraudulent ? 
  i think it 's also a case of `` having your cake and eating it too . '', 
  they want all the benefits of free trade/etc . 
  that the eu provides , without giving anything back . 
  those categorizations are inaccurate .
