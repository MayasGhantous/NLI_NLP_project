  fellow germans , please confirm or disagree : * fats : olive oil and butter * fruits : tomato and banana * vegetables : potatoes and lettuce * carbs : noodles and rice * bread : germans are big on bread . 
  we have more than 600 different types and it might be put on a unesco list . 
  according to wikipedia : `` germany 's most popular breads are white bread , rye-wheat , multigrain , whole-grain , toast , sunflower seed bread , ... '' * spices : black pepper and herbs * meat : pork is still most popular * nuts , seeds , etc. 
  : peanuts * [ cheeses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_german_cheeses ) : gouda , emmentaler and cream cheese * pre-made sauces and dips : ketchup and mustard top 3 things i like to make : + salad with lettuce , tomato , red cabbage , olives , chicken + sweet potato with mixed vegetables + chicken with mixed vegetables, 
  and apparently reading bild zeitung , watching reality tv and soccer games . 
  one of the most powerful passports in the world , one of the most powerful leaders in the world , democracy , freedom , healthcare , excellent education , rich . 
  too many nationalists , not at lot of patriots . 
  i am not proud of my heritage because there is nothing i did to be german . 
  some of the best soccer team 's in the world . 
  i got one word : oktoberfest . 
  birth place - mid-hesse - hesse - mid-germany - germany - central europe - europe - western world - world, 
  very stressful . 
  my colleagues and i always have way more tasks than we can manage and we overstep one deadline after another . 
  there is constant fear of forgetting something , not making the customer happy and having to redue it . 
  if someone is on vacation or sick all hell breaks loose . 
  headaches , high blood pressure and nightmares are common . 
  on the other hand the fast pace means we learn a lot in a very short time . 
  and we make a great team . 
  same here . 
  i 'd be irritated the light is n't orange , telling you to stop , check and then pass . 
  but if it were red , i 'd wait , too . 
  at least in a car . 
  same here , too . 
  but some of my friends from other parts of germany could also choose russian as a second foreign language . 
  st. patrick 's day , halloween and last year i went to my first mexican d\u00eda de muertos party in germany . 
  i 'll be snapchatting for the city of munich on st. patrick 's day so there better be a big celebration . 
  i am hoping for green beer and a green river at one point . 
  i grew up in a german town near an american army base . 
  club owners must have thought that americans mostly dance to hip hop so they played hip hop everywhere and i learnt to dance to it . 
  when i moved to new york city i explored some hip hop clubs and it turned out that 90 percent of the visitors were african americans , some hispanics and hardly any caucasians . 
  i got asked where i am am from all the time and if i was hispanic . 
  i became friends with a larger black crowed , my boyfriend was black . 
  i loved the way water looked when it dripped down his skin after he took a shower . 
  those african americans who liked me called me `` snowflake '' , those who did n't `` bread '' . 
  to me , african americans are simply people . 
  and when i had to move back to germany i missed having so many of them around . 
  further stereotypes include large penises , good dancer , great rapper . 
  i once heard a small child pointing at a black person on the subway and asking his mom why that person is dirty . 
  it shows that because we do not have that many black people living among us , people can be quite ignorant because it is seen as `` the other '' and we are not exposed to much african american culture and black culture in general . 
  water and oatmeal with ( almond ) milk . 
  i live in munich , one of the most expensive cities in germany , and i spend 25 % on rent . 
  there is an unwritten rule that one should not go above 33 % . 
  facebook , signal , snapchat and whatsapp . 
  when i visited my family in texas . 
  i am married to an american and we speak english , he 's religious and i 'm atheist , he likes volleyball i like lifting weights , he 's okay with weapons and i despise them . 
  but we believe in the same political values , love dogs and sushi and met in 2003 , when i was an exchange student at his high school . 
  i am moving to the states even though trump is president . 
  love ca n't conquer all but it sure can conquer a lot . 
  `` first name last name , hello ? '', 
  patriotic , yes , but hopefully not nationalist . 
  i was going to say , i do n't remember seeing flags and i do n't even remember if we had flag poles . 
  and i went to school during 9/11 . 
  hessian here . 
  i learnt british english in school but i went to the states as a teenager so now my pronunciation is american . 
  open winter coat , big scarf , oversized or crop top , tight rolled up pants , sneaker or boots . 
  i agree . 
  yup !, 
  i was going to write the same . 
  i think the first time an american told me `` i am german , too '' it baffled me . 
  but the more i learned about race and racism , ethnicity , nationality , culture , traditions etc. 
  the more annoyed i got , thinking to myself `` you are not german . 
  you do n't speak the language , you do n't know our political system , you do n't know one dish ... you are of german decent , your heritage is german '' . 
  and depending on my mood , i will either nod and get out of the conversation or tell people that i do not perceive them as german and most germans would not either . 
  hence i do n't like it when some countries issue passports to foreigners if their grandparents were from that country but never plan on living there . 
  but it 's not just americans . 
  many german kids will be like `` i 'm turkish '' but once they arrive in turkey , people will tell them they are not , because they do n't speak the language without accent etc. 
  they are germans with 1st/2nd/3rd turkish migrational background . 
  interesting perception . 
  i get `` cool , i 'm german , too '' all the time . 
  yes . 
  i agree . 
  oh , you 're right , they do play it during the olympics and also during formula 1 , for example . 
  i just do n't watch olympics and formula 1 anymore , so i totally forgot . 
  thank you for reminding me . 
  [ list of killings by law enforcement officers in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_germany ) shows one person was shot in 2014 and two in 2015 . 
  in the us , there were 48 in november 2016 alone . 
  [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_united_states,_november_2016 ), 
  i learned the composition , musical notes , melody and text of the [ `` song of germany '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutschlandlied ) in fourth grade . 
  but we hardly every sing it besides world and european soccer cups . 
  so during four weeks every other year . 
  since soccer is our national sport , it 's very emotional . 
  and every time media outlets and society start a discussion because [ not all soccer players sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21oylbuzxmg ) it . 
  germany . 
  yes , i do . 
  my parents and my sibling do n't fly so they never come visit and i ca n't always be there for them and give them a hug when i want to . 
  my friends think my city is not worth visiting because it 's not nyc or in florida/california . 
  i miss our political system , more options when it comes to political parties , i miss 30 days of annual vacation , i miss the health care system , people being able to take off months to years when having a child , i miss public transport , national holidays and traditions as well as some of my favourite foods . 
  i miss being able to express myself exactly the way i meant to . 
  and it does n't help being called `` alien '' or `` nazi '' . 
  however , there are at least as many thinks i like better about my new country than my old . 
  so in the end , it evens out . 
  you do n't see any other major differences ? 
  what about the way we think about nazi germany , natinalism , jews and guilt ? 
  what about women 's rights , lgbt , marriage/relationships and having kids ? 
  what about environmental impact , cars vs. public transport vs. bike ? 
  what about social network and big data ? 
  munich is known for beer brewing , bwm and it and tech : microsoft , amazon , linkedin etc. 
  all have an office and ibm brought a watson here . 
  berlin is known for startups . 
  we do not need to spend tax money to secure the streets of germany for a racist .
