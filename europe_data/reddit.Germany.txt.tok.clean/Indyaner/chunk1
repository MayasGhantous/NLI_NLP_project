i see oss on the map . 
  does the oss by any chance has something to do with osdorp ? 
  15 years ago i was with friends in nl and there was this song coming on the tv : [ osdorp posse - origineel amsterdams ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxz04h2xs3c ), 
  mof here , where would you locate the guys from '' [ new kids ] ( http://www.comedycentral.tv/shows/410-new-kids ) '' ? 
  [ for the lazy ones ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/cem-44-la-chine-la-tartarie-chinoise-et-le-thibet-1734-2568.jpg ) by / u/cookedbird there was a bit of discussion about the right map that was given . 
  / u/lehyde [ +1 ] has pointed [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21xmw7/merkel_gives_the_chinese_president_the_first/cghnbzg?context=2 ) , what seems to be the latest word in this discussion . 
  the sheme graphics looks very interesting . 
  any chance that you could translate the captions ? 
  i dont get these potato jokes . 
  what is it about ? 
  i never heart about a connection between latvia and potatoes on a joke . 
  is it an insider joke ? 
  i give you credit for finding the source . 
  but , i dont think there was ever a shortage . 
  it looks like some writers just looked up consumer electronic online stores ( namely : conrad ) and the last 5 + were sold out and therefore the writers declared a shortage . 
  a shortage for ambitious buyer and the professional sector was never given , i would think . 
  therefore , a shortage in geiger meter in germany is more a sign for the lousy journalism in our country then for the so often stated german angst . 
  can you please provide a source for that ? 
  i only found a very ( very ) boulevard source for a sellout in austria . 
  but not germany . 
  i 'm from germany . 
  i 've never ever heard of that . 
  while this is true , i was pointing out that your `` germany has no choice but to rely increasingly on coal '' is just not true . 
  i see you are from bulgaria . 
  do you know what we try to come up with to not rely on nuclear or coal ? 
  for example [ nordlink ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord.link ) . 
  we are really trying to find alternative ways for our energy while not having to use nuclear or fossil energy and are throwing money to our research-institutes to develop this technologys . 
  [ this map ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:european-union-renewables-new.svg ) is showing that your country is in the same category when it comes to renewable energies . 
  as you can see , nordlink is not a bad idea , as scandinavia is heavily using alternative energy and germany has a broad stand for the idea of the european union . 
  thats why we have no problem with dependency on our partners . 
  scandinavia we can trust . 
  gas from the east-states is something we are very very critical about , as we see how russia is using it against ukraine as a pressurising medium . 
  my last sentence to this topic should be : we try our best to not use coal in the near future , but we had the balls to get out of nuclear technology and are now in the transition to a hopefully better solution while everybody else still thinks nuclear energy is the best idea since sliced bread . 
   germany has no choice but to rely increasingly on coal . 
  because alternative energy is something made up by hippies , right . 
  i like this map even more : it shows how much `` off '' a timezone is from the actually sunrise/sunset . 
  see the legend for a better idea on what you are looking at . 
  i would at least try it for a decade or two and see how that works for once - because we know how it currently works . 
  as for example : we must try to regulate the isp as an analog tool and simple provider . 
  he can not have to much political and intrusive power as even to inject , high-jack or deep-packet-inspect the data we send over it . 
  there is no way , an isp should be able to know what is send over its cable . 
  they provide the cable . 
  an isp ist just a tool . 
  end endpoint . 
  a plug into the internet . 
  they can not have the power to track me in the first place - let alone anyone else in the net . 
  currently i got a vpn , with firefox , ublock , umatrix - both with a whitelist . 
  this is the closest i can get to the web back in 98 . 
  it is amazing how i have not the right , to get that kind of low exposure not by default . 
  my poor uncle . 
  they are all tracked when they go online . 
  i dont think that this should be a thing . 
  and it only took 20 years . 
  / s glad it came to the point . 
  hey there . 
  feel free to tell [ the cartoonist ] ( https://twitter.com/ch_cartoon ) how unfunny and unwitty his propaganda is . 
  i 'm sure he will stop doing it and will only draw witty und funny from then on . 
  but it was clever to recreate it just above the german flag . 
  what are we supposed to do ? 
  make the black bar bigger ? 
  not gon na happen . 
   you human garbage . 
  i have no problem doing things that does not appeal to your view , as you are apparently not able to hold a normal discussion with people even on the internet . 
  are you sure you have an attitude that is fair , balanced and takes the whole complexity of topic into account ? 
  i disagree with most of what you said . 
  that there a no people involved in storage facility . 
  that nuclear zones are not unihabitable but only uninhabited . 
  that the european energy certificate trading is a complete scam . 
  i cant see where you come from , most likely finland as you linked to the finish storage block . 
  but it feels to me you are coming from somewhere else , because you are so mistrusting the system in europe - or you are just a concerned citizen , which would be good . 
  anyway , i think we will see how it will play out . 
  i really hope we are not that redarded as we currently seem to you in the near future , but if so , i 'm sorry for that , but i think it was the right thing to do . 
  in an european scale we might exit to late the coal , yes , but in an international scale we are making the right decisions . 
  i hope we can forgot those 10-20 years in the next 100 years . 
  i know that the nuclear waste mines will not in 10.000 years . 
  we buy in power from our neighbors . 
  our citizens choose what power they want and the suppliers have to buy in those sort of powers . 
  that way we - in theory - export more coal energy . 
  with the downside that we keep the stinking plants . 
  but in 10 years we will have enough offshore and bonds with allies that we are not depending on coal as a main energy support . 
  please see those [ documents ] ( http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/klima-energie/erneuerbare-energien/erneuerbare-energien-in-zahlen#quartalsberichte ) . 
  we take more time to exit coal in contrast to our neighbors , yes , but we also had the biggest coal industry and have therefore a bigger fight to get this monkey off our backs . 
  but as you can see in the graphic , we will eventually reach a time that has been set as an exit . 
  china ? 
  usa ? 
  anyone ? 
  as you are such a fan of inline-replyijng , i will meet your favorite way of discussion :  try reading that sentence again . 
  i tried , i came to the conclusion you called our decision retarded . 
  we and i am not . 
  is it really retarded or did you mean something like `` unproven approach '' or `` neglecting act '' ( en is not my first language ) , because calling something and someone retarded , is an opinion and not a description . 
   it remains irrelevant . 
  yeah cool counter argument . 
  the video does not at all show what problems sotring and handling nuclear waste can be - even for a country like the us . 
  not thinking about every country in the east and west of it . 
  i 'm sure , that they all have very decend nuclear waste handling skills and not a single unit is lost or thrown over board because the cost of storage is so high . 
  sure man . 
   that 's no issue . 
  nuclear waste can wait . 
  it 's not going anywhere . 
  geological data goes back a long time , and as it 's recorded in the very rocks itself we can look back thousands , perhaps even millions of years .
