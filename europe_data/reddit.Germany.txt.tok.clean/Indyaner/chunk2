  also , there is no problem with earthquakes/tsunamis hitting atomic plants , letting it leak and make a huge area unhapitable for the next 1000 years . 
  the mine , you linked is perfect . 
  the website is very clean , the 2 text boxes look very decend and i have no counter argument that this place is in deed a very safe place for all the atomic waste to store for the next 24.000 years halftime . 
  i have my glassbowl not on me , but i guess only time will tell . 
  but i 'm sure that if anything leaks , everybody will get instantly updated on it . 
   [ http://www.tvo.fi/operatingwaste] this is indeed a very nice solution for a problem that could be avoided . 
  i 'm sure the people who will work in the 5000 years nuclear waste storages will be glad for their long time jobs they and their children will have . 
  and if it is full , we can just build another one . 
  this is also a great solution for economy . 
  but i prefer to have a business model that has more potential to be developed further . 
  like solar , or waterpower . 
   except it is n't . 
  you forgot what comments you were replying too . 
  it was a comment about how germany is operating it 's coal power plants for far longer than it needs to , because it wants to get rid of nuclear first . 
  as i mentioned in antoher comment : there is no shortage of energy . 
  we have strong bond to our neighbors and most of our neighbors have not even begun to exit atomic energy . 
  we already import more green power from them then we produce our self . 
   as such , you 're directly defending coal . 
  coal is the logical and inevitable solution of the german nuclear phaseout . 
  * coal is the logical and inevitable solution of the german nuclear phaseout . 
  * that , is a retarded sentence . 
  [ seriously ] ( http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/klima-energie/erneuerbare-energien/erneuerbare-energien-in-zahlen ) , there are only two options for us ? 
  our neighbors have enough nuclear energy for decades . 
  if our citizens buy green power , they have to be delivered green power . 
  the power companys buy those into the market . 
   and let 's see about those results . 
   try counting again . 
  i hate this commenting style , so picky , like someone falls into every word in a discussion . 
  how is this not disrespectful to read ? 
  only that you have to bring it there , store it there , prevent it from leaking ( materials that withstand 24.000 years havnt yet been found ) , gelogical stable , not rained on , not leaking into the soil , not creatinc a critical event bei placing it in too large quantities , not having it fall in the hands of people we dont want to , not beaing dealt with by people that can not be trusted , etc. 
  your russian tundra is a joke . 
  in what political world do you live that in the next 100 years there will be a giant hole where we throw all that atomic waste after it has been shipped and driven into the russian land ? 
  is this a serious answer by you ? 
  it seems like a very childish solution to a problem . 
  green energy is n't . 
  that is what we are heading for . 
  we will exit the atomic energy by 2022 and have by then most of our energy by renewable resources . 
  we are already buy more green energy then we can produce ourselfs and is coming from our neighbors . 
  we have enough atomic energy for the next 100 years in our near neighborhood . 
  france has not even begun to end their atomic programs . 
  there will no shortage of energy what so ever . 
  we come up with better ways to store and transport it every decade . 
  we are developing a whole new way of generating energy and create a new business sector by that as well . 
  am i missing something ? 
  who is that guy that told everyone i love coal ? 
  because my post didnt said that . 
  i 'm for green energy . 
  and germany is loving it as well already . 
  were doing great . 
  we are on our best way to succeed . 
  in ~ 10 years we are coal free while the us discussed to promote coal . 
  what the eff ? 
  cool one sentence answer reply style . 
  also that you were calling me a `` retarded '' made clear that you are not in the mood for a serious discussion . 
  therefore short : 1 . 
  the documenation is from 1996 gathering the event until said day . 
  ratard . 
  we dont know for decades if a region will me stable . 
  geologically _ and _ political . 
  but sure , show me a single instance with a working solution . 
  3 . who said i 'm for coal ? 
  [ this a [ straw man argument ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man ) : you are trying to shift a opinion on me , that i never declared myself , therefore is an assumption ] . 
  your last sentence sarcasm was pretty cool . 
  really shmick mike drop man . 
  i like the we-part you are using . 
  i should do this as well : we like green energy . 
  we are the leading developer of that unharmfull energy harvest systems , because we made a jump while you still think about sitting up . 
  see , i can do this too . 
  they dont [ tell ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tkrfp7cuxa ) [ you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl8emqk5kow ) [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kot1thqbii&amp;t=23s ) . 
  please , there is no place on earth , where you can put something and can be sure what will happen to that place , in the next 10.000 years - at least . 
  there is no place on earth , that will be of known control in the next 1000 years . 
  there is a fundamental flaw to creating radioactive waste . 
  you pass problerms off to the next generation . 
  you cant control it . 
  if something happens , it is not only a burden for a small region , it can travel with sand and air . 
  i support the exit of my countries atomic energy programm . 
  lets find a cleaner way to use atomic energy first . 
  the wastefull way is not the best solution for mankind . 
  i always thought * focus * is the * computer bild * of the economy and stock market . 
  basicly my granddad informing him on the minus of his telekom shares - or about a printer in said * computer bild * . 
  do you have more of these images ? 
  they are stunning . 
  recently i was looking for height-maps of the world and found that [ worlddem ] ( http://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/worlddem-sampledata/ ) to be one of the [ most ] ( http://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/files/pmedia/public/r41961_9_worlddem_dsm_04_n16_00_w025_00_dem_kapverden_800pix_300dpi_v2.jpg ) [ impressive ] ( http://www.engesat.com.br/wp-content/uploads/compartivo-worlddem-srtm.png ) when it comes to rendered images . 
  but i likes yours as well because of the natural asthetics . 
  do you have more ? 
  what do i have to look for , to find those images ? 
  can i generate them myself ? 
  i find this important to be told everytime this comes up . 
  as a german , i would take you back in a heartbeat without a fuzz . 
  we struggle the same problem here in germany , that because of the old demographic group the center right party is the current choice . 
  good thing : the chancellor has a pretty left view on some cases ( refugees e.g. ), 
  and therefore doesnt rides the law & order agenda not more , then in the past . 
  in england your middle right to right is quite stubborn and vocal . 
  those people are nearly at the end of their lifes and did n't quite made the transition and could keep up the pace of globalization and foreign connections . 
  you guys are us some thousand years ago . 
  we are the same people . 
  it is just the modern national state that impressed a lot of people to an extend of protectionism and patriotism . 
  you are already on your way back as it seems . 
  you seem to gain the upper hand again in some month , just in time hopefully to end the end of the leave-process and are able to vote the european idea back into your collective idea . 
  i was in [ strasbourg ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/stra%c3%9fburg#im_deutschen_reich ) the other day and it was just beautiful .
