  nice ~ ~ shopping mall ~ ~ palace . 
  i asked a friend of mine who lives in bejing and is half chinese half korean about that she answered : `` i 've seen a documentary about how koreans treat foreigners . '', 
  `` there was a canadian professor who lives in korea '' `` he said he plays a little game when he takes a taxi home '' `` when the driver ask him where he 's from he answers either ghana or canada '' `` when he says ghana the drivers become very rude to him but when he says canada they become very nice and friendly '' `` and there 's an american actor who 's wife is korean he said koreans idolize people from developed countries and look down upon indians africans and phllipinas '' `` so the guy on reddit is probably too cautious about europe he does n't want to be treated like the koreans treat indians '' maybe that explains it a bit but i guess a korean who really lives in south korea would give a better answer, 
  even in paris is autumn . 
  yeah thats for ppl 60 + its so flat holy shit and all the puns and useless skatches ... its very cringeworthy . 
  i looked something up about the german headless horsemen the other day they mentioned it .

  * ring * ring : `` hallo ? 
  we have a city like this too ; waldbr\u00f6l we call it klein moskau . 
  i hate the fact that the article dont mention how much the fucking pudding costs in isreal ...

  iam ok with him working for gazprom , but he shouldnt open his mouth in public ever again . 
   the russian federation is still an ally , this is not a cold war , and ukraine is not part of the european union . 
  haha imagine someone with a german flair would say that in this subreddit . 
  isnt that the job of any opposition ? 
  pointing out all mistakes to the current government ? 
  / u/knecht _ is the first guy in history after pope urban the ii saying that . 
  also  how do you understand the word `` novorussia '' ? 
   i do n't understand it / take it seriously / want to comment it -- 43 % lol, 
  we are only number 1 because there is no data for austria . 
  also we are just good at lying , our unemplaymentrate is way higher but as soon as someone is in a jobseminar or even if someone is sick he will not get listed for this month . 
  and there even more ppl that dont go to the arbeitsamt and are still jobless they wo n't get listet too .

  how do french people pronounce nathan ? 
  it just dont make sence in my head . 
  he will probably speak german , finnish or english till kindergarten and then slowly get better and more fluent in danish than his parents . 
  either way this kid is very lucky . 
  and the rest of this sub is from belarus . 
  we could finally prise the supreme leader like we all should do anyways . 
  dont take that shit talk on reddit too serious , every time someone mention how racist germany is its always like `` but someone who was there told me '' or `` i heared how they treat their immigrants '' or `` europeans are all racist !, 
  we treat our niggers way better '' and thinks like this get incredibly upvoted and if you as a german who actually lives in that country try to argue its just denying . 
  but i see this kind of post about every european country , we are all racist over here . 
  could we stop with this silly warscenarios that will never happen like this ever . 
  now we only need a complete comment line about wwii and we are / r/worldnews ...

  i mean lets say there is a little town right on the boarder and it is scottish for now , but would vote 80 % against independence .

  i have the feeling this will be a very long process ...
