  i expect it is already happening . 
  not sure what , if any , international agreements that 3rd world thug nation has signed but at least formally we are not talking about immigrants but about refugees . 
  different rules apply . 
  well , there is the question , well , lots of questions , on what level of comfort a state should provide . 
  there 's a lot of options between fencing them off in tent cities with barely enough water and food , separate from society , as may happen in africa or syria 's neighbouring countries or integrating them in society and supplying them with tax financed free housing and cash . 
  then you have to decide who is required to return home and when . 
  there are no friends in politics . 
  granted , the assads are mostly on russia but even so europe happily sold weapons to them e.g. 
  well , germany does too . 
  you have to be fairly poor and you have to pay half back eventually iirc but still . 
  i like how suomi calles the swedes something that sounds suspiciously like the german word for snot . 
  my point was the xenophobic , or really general phobic , attitude of the commenters here . 
  worse than in germany . 
  indeed that is a rather tame and okay protest . 
  their demands may be inappropriate or immoderate but why should n't they be allowed to complain ? 
  that 's some serious no news especially for those not able to read swedish . 
  have fun realizing the difference between math and reality . 
  well , syria has 20 mio pop . 
  if eventually they * all * flee ... 
  but seriously , most refugees are in neighbouring countries , about 4 mio . 
  a fair number of those arriving now are men from turkish refugee camps who decided the turks will pretty much let them rot and starve and they are trying to earn some money to send back to their families . 
  this applies to many coming from libya too - many of them are actually libyan workforce from further south that are now out of work due to the civil war - they too have to send money back to their families . 
  admittedly they are not refugees . 
  it is understandable that from such a great distance you fall for the propaganda of the australian government . 
  after all , their own citizens do to . 
  but rather you should research the actual facts and data ; nothing has changed in australia , both most boat people and those arriving by plane eventually end up on the mainland and are granted asylum - and the numbers are not dropping . 
  this following program is not to be construed as support of whale hunting .

  itt : now i 'm okay with our few neonazis and spiessers if this is the standard in the rest of europe . 
  i 'm okay with writing in 2 languages but the fun ends at just adding a line of gibberish at the end , tyrosinejim !, 
  it 's not just obfuscated , it 's an abomination . 
  see , frankish dialects ( roughly what is spoken along and west of the rhine up to karlsruhe , along most of the main and in most of hessen ) are supposed to be high german but dutch is a * low * german frankish dialect . 
  they must be purged . 
  everybody heard it ? 
  we have it in writing !, 
  he agrees they are renegade provinces !, 
  ( this one never gets lame  ), 
  i 'm always willing to make fun of our renegade northwest provinces but that is rather lame . 
  you forgot italian food . 
  honestly , i would miss that more . 
  indian food . 
  well , that was a really dumb crackpot read . 
  the links to the blog are hilarious though . 
  you misspelled proven, 
  and here is how a pro does it : https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/3ez6xq/iama_student_who_spent_10_months_living_in_a_back/, 
  i guess he just was n't aware * how * hard it is to find affordable lodgings in geneva . 
  ... and then google fails to translate it into english ... \\* sigh \\* `` i did not choose the tent more waterproof the store '', 
  there are gm sheep ? 
  i see no advantage over a concrete wall . 
  hrvtzka can not into eu . 
  old map . 
  i am starting to think somebody is intentionally spreading news about how bad russian economy supposedly is . 
  quite a few badly sourced articles showed up the last 2 weeks . 
  i think k\u00f6nigsberg should suffer a few more years of russian occupation for creating the most boring philosopher ever . 
  remind me in , say 2030 ? 
  sigh . 
  you are just doing that to force us to invade you * again * next war and give us a bad rep. dutch , always playing dirty . 
  they did n't recycle the bins and boxes !, 
  okay , that 's it , boys , get them !, 
  germany will not stand by idly while some dictator creates unsorted garbage !, 
  ready the naval helicopters !, 
  i know of no cases in europe but the last time this came up in a subreddit several us-americans gave detailed accounts of why their employers do n't give away food any more , including being sued because of food poisoning etc - admittedly without sources though . 
  but we do ironically . 
  i mean , we * do * all call her that ironically ? 
  please ? 
  it works for the tax outcome , the cheap labor and germany 's hegemony in europe but not for the people working 3 jobs or working full time and still getting nowhere . 
  schr\u00f6der was n't in it for the money . 
  those people do n't go into politics in germany . 
  he was in it for his ego . 
  there have been a few times where mps did not vote along party lines and every time the perception was `` oh no the world is coming to an end . '', 
  it is also telling that , despite not being mentioned by law at all , there is the term party/faction discipline and it is formally announced by faction leaders when you are actually free to vote as your conscience tells you - which is what the law actually mandates . 
  edit : oddly , what you 're proposing works just fine in cities and on a local level . 
  [ flinten-uschi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ursula_von_der_leyen ) might have become the next chancellor but merkel deftly maneuvered her into the rather unimportant and crisis ridden ministry of defence ( the ministry of defence also seems to reliably turn politicians into raving lunatics but that 's just a private theory of mine ) . 
  wishful thinking , protection/separation from russia . 
  most germans do n't know about the teutonic and livonian order . 
  i see your joke and raise with : who invented triathlon ? 
  the poles ; walk to the public swimming pool , come back on a bicycle . 
  those were popular in germany too but they seem to have died out . 
  odd . 
  turkey is part of europe but russia and belarus are not . 
  how times have changed , 
  hessen feels the burn, 
  they are making a weak case for this actually being useful but a strong case for this helping total control and abuse of power . 
  managing resources usually is n't the issue , protecting resources and enforcing law is the issue and that will still be as expensive and not happening for the same reasons it 's not happening now . 
  tight budgets , corruption , lobbyism etc. 
  imo the german number is misleading . 
  it should be almost entirely social services you more or less get back . 
  of course the same could be claimed for any tax but let me break it down : minimum wage is 8,50 $ / h so monthly should clock in at 1360 $ gross/brutto . 
  * ~ 125 $ is old age insurance . 
  it 's payed out to your grandparents but if the system still works then ( hehe ) your grandchildren should pay yours . 
  if you 'd organize it privately you 'd have to pay at least the same . 
  * ~ 110-130 $ is health insurance * ~ 20 $ is nursing care insurance , mostly for elderly and chronically sick * ~ 20 $ is unemployment insurance * ~ 6 bucks is church tax . 
  obviously you can be exempt from that . 
  * finally , only ~ 60 $ are actual income tax edit : assuming 40h/week and 4 weeks/month . 
  usually it 's caclculated with 4,35 weeks/month but since we are looking at the percentage it does n't make much difference . 
  edit edit : while all of the above is mandatory/compulsory only the income tax goes into the `` big pool '' of taxes . 
  the other items are organized separately and government or parliament can not touch them/use them to do anything ~ ~ odd like buy tanks or finance their private jets ~ ~ different so i would argue they are indeed not taxes . 
  like you would mind swooping in with some dashing cavalry , driving out a much larger army without serious fighting and gaining the status saviour of catholicism - again . 
  all right , all right , i 'm coming . 
  will august be fine ?
