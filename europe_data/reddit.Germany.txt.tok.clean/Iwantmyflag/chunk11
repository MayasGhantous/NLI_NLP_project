  and there better be no rain . 
  uhm , actually those are romanian ( and before that polish ) workers who come here just for the harvest season ( s ) , living in `` boxes . '', 
  no german would or does work in the fields for 7 bucks . 
  the same goes for spain - romanians actually drive that far for work . 
  if it 's not romanians it is illegal ( sometimes even legal , woohey ) immigrants from africa . 
  if france actually pays decent wages that make harvesting * and * living in france possible , i 'm fine with that . 
  the catch : while germans think they are pretty ok and the rest of the world does too , just a little less , russians think their country is shit and the rest of the world thinks it 's really really shit , 
  * nor, 
  the good old times, 
   bosnia  utilities hehehe ... 
  it 's a bit like the `` here be dragons '' on old maps , 
  freiburg and heidelberg are also placed a bit oddly . 
  edit : also , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_european_plain, 
  i like norwegian best . 
  it sounds kind and homely , yet heroic-archaic . 
  swedish sounds a tad more snobish or businesslike . 
  danish is somewhat deteriorated muttering . 
  finnish sounds like someone who likes to routinely pat you on the back so hard you fall over , lives in a wooden cabin by a lake and likes to fish , sometimes feels the need to randomly kill someone and then returns to their day job as a circus clown ; strong , dark and evil but also funny . 
  the language really asks for black metal . 
  just on paper . 
  just on paper . 
  ^ ^ wait , ^ ^ is ^ ^ that ^ ^ why ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ called ^ ^ bokmal ? 
  nordic bros, 
  do n't worry , for me all 4 are equally cute and funny . 
  nottheonion anyone ? 
  maybe they are thinking of lakes ? 
  in german , ` die see ' is the sea but ` ein see ' is a lake . 
  oh , no no , you got it wrong . 
  this was explained to me in great detail . 
  see , the center of europe is a village in ukraine ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rakhiv ) . 
  that obviously makes ukraine central europe . 
  russia is north of ukraine so clearly it 's central europe too . 
  it follows then that everything west of russia and ukraine has to be central europe too , if not western europe . 
  certainly i have convinced you but still , you ask , where is eastern europe then ?? 
  well , see that smudge of kazakhstan that is west of the ural river ? 
  yes , that 's eastern europe . 
  and today you learned that kazakhstan is part of europe , 
  wow , you drank the whole package of neoliberal buzzword kool-aid in one go . 
  mad props !, 
  got my bullshit bingo done !, 
   beating mattresses and carpets over your balcony is forbidden !, 
  use  the provided facilities in the courtyard . 
   you are permitted to shake blankets and laundry over your balcony  during the following times are you sure those are not from germany ? 
  iirc this actually damages the protective properties of an ( uncooked ) egg . 
  but the map was so much prettier . 
  for the glory !,

  the other odd one out , for me , is the semitic maltese . 
  languages of the eu : la , la , la , semitic . 
  huh ?? 
  semitic ?? 
  it did n't help that malta was so small on the map , 
   wwii our bonds grew weaker oh cut the unbearable norsk politeness ; after we invaded and burned down your country and behaved like absolute , inhumane barbarians ... you were probably faster than anybody else to forgive us or at least not bear a grudge . 
  they are even called `` offshore asylum processing centres '' so while it is hard to get exact numbers and a clear picture , especially after 2012 , at least some detainees there are granted asylum .

  i do n't understand how many people here still have n't got syriza position . 
  let me give you a solid starting point : syriza wants debt cut . 
  if greece does not pay , no investor ( by now increasingly you , the tax payer ) gets their money back . 
  now try again to figure it out , please . 
  it 's the numbers of the gov. 
  not my fault they do n't have anything more recent . 
  http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/rp/rp1415/asylumfacts this link has data for 2014 but it does n't look much different . 
  my impression is that the gov is picking up boats and redirecting them to papua or nauru , then granting asylum from there and selling this as `` no boats arrive in australia . '', 
  of course it is hard to tell what is really going on , with all the data coming from the gov. 
  you can read the 2013 number ( 18.000 ) and 2014 ( 9000 ) as beginning success but i 'm not convinced . 
  so ... pretty much no , 
  @ 100s : http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/bn/2011-2012/boatarrivals#_toc285178607 i guess what i was trying to say was that a ) australia is in a different situation ( i guess we agree that much ) but also b ) it does * not * have a coherent policy but a changing one and one that is mostly misleading the public . 
  the `` you wo n't get in '' propaganda a ) does not deter people and b ) is not the truth at all . 
  well , i do support a debt cut for greece . 
  i would also have let the banks and private investors bleed . 
  to me it is common sense to get the money from those who have it , not those who do n't . 
  i was sarcastic of course but what i 'm referring to is that many saxons came to the west after the wall fell and it was a very distinct ( some would say annoying ) dialect that pretty much no one in the west had ever heard and now was everywhere . 
  i do have a question though . 
  i thought norway was rich because of oil . 
  then i see the wealth distribution map from the 19th and early 20th century - you guys have always been rich , as rich as the swiss !, 
  i thought you were poor farmers and fishers . 
  what 's the secret ? 
  is it all the gold you stole in medieval times ^ ^ or is keeping out of costly wars ? 
  there are 2 details i 'd like to point out that are often not communicated : 1 ) the total number of refugees and those seeking asylum , by boat , by plane , `` legal '' or `` illegal '' - while recently increasing - is ridiculously small compared to europe . 
  it 's typically in the 100s , only a few years ~ 5000 vrs . 
  100.000 s per year . 
  2 ) while many refugees are legally tolerated one way or another in many european countries , at least for a few years , the number of those who are granted formal asylum is fairly low . 
  those who are determined to come from a safe country are indeed deported . 
  australia on the other hand ultimately grants permanent visa to up to 90 % of refugees - even those detained in papua or nauru . 
  well , one thing cyprus did different than greece , from what i can tell , is that those with deposits beyond 100.000 $ had those cut in half , be they cypriots , russians , brit expats or tax evaders . 
  not necessarily a sound and fair thing but still better than cutting the pensions of the poor . 
  plus , it seems to work ( of course that was only one detail of the proceedings ) . 
  people who come from the near east , to profit from our social systems , taking our jobs , our money ? 
  not fitting in religiously , politically and culturally ? 
  refusing to speak proper german ? 
  i know about those . 
  they sit at the register at my aldi and speak saxon dialect . 
  it would be funny if it was n't so sad . 
  my thought : while technically/historically correct , you ca n't play the `` backwater with no influence on international politics '' card while sitting in the same boat as germany , france , spain and britain and profiting from a unified market and currency . 
  how about just putting a `` controversial '' or `` opinion '' tag ? 
  this way the mods do n't have to decide what is `` good '' content and readers know opinions differ on the validity of the source . 
  at least we do not have a melodic word accent like a tonal language . 
  chinese huggers . 
  you are a disgrace for the germanic , even the indogermanic language family :p, 
  well , we may all live under our favorite rock , but in any case i have n't read about cyprus in over 2 years .
