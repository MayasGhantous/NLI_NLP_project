  i ca n't even recall someone in media comparing cyprus to greece . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012\u201313_cypriot_financial_crisis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_adjustment_programme_for_cyprus http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26650811, 
  honestly , we have/had forgotten about cyprus real quick . 
  you already used up all the dark red color for income comparison maps , now do n't complain !, 
  um ... you were trying to return bottles for the deposit but you got a rant instead ? 
  probably because of our higly sophisticated ( = totally broken ) deposit system . 
  but luckily someone spoke german and fixed it , english did n't work ? 
  i have to admit that was a lot harder , 
  really sweden . 
  get a grip and switch to german proper already . 
  i can read it all anyway . 
  you even have `` unn\u00f6tig . '', 
  clearly you are speaking poorly disguised german . 
  there are literally ** 3 ** words in that post that are different from german - and even that probably only at first glance . 
  it 's like they * want * a proper revolution ... 
  ah , but have you seen the capital p ? 
  looks like greece ca n't even pay for gif coloring any more . 
  my issue : ice cubes dilute the taste . 
  i guess that 's not a problem if you drink oversugared brown piss or booze anyway . 
  please have the pole tell him that austrians are really just germans . 
  i ca n't tell him , i ca n't handle the anschluss jokes, 
  itt : we are learning so much about democracy , theory and practice these days , it 's beautiful . 
  it behoves us-americans to prefer oligarchy/plutocracy to democracy . 
  that , after all is the essence of capitalism . 
  keep in mind , however , that despite your best efforts in europe we are all communists . 
  let me word it like this : `` we , the elected government , want to do the people 's will . 
  so we ask . 
  however , as a government , we also have an opinion . '', 
  it can be a different thing if you are employed by the state , like in administration , then neutrality might be warranted . 
  * the economy experts on reddit *, 
  hey !, 
  ** i ** decide whether you 're triggering me or not !, 
  too soon , guys , too soon . 
  * bavarian school organizes meetings between pupils and syrian refugees nearby to explain the rights of women , differing customs and laws etc. 
  in germany , to prevent intercultural misunderstandings and worse * some towns actually get this together edit : oh , this is rt anyway so it might be entirely made up, 
  i would say that 's why there is the word idiot in idiosyncrasy but a ) that 's not entirely etymologically right and b ) that would make me a prescreptivist so ... i 'm not saying it . 
  itt : that 's not what '' begs the question '' means . 
  as a general advice , never use `` begs the question '' . 
  it 's an expression that should die out . 
  i 'm relaxed . 
  the economy experts on reddit have been wrong about everything since 2008 . 
  now they are predicting the destruction of the euro , the eu , even europe , so all will be fine . 
  ah , you 're that guy who once in a while picks me up when hitchhiking and tells me `` money is good but i should have transitioned to something more relaxed/stable years ago yet my company wo n't let me . '', 
  impression of italy and bulgaria confirmed, 
  well , obviously the finnish were cavedwellers until the swedish overlords arrived and blessed them with the concept of currency . 
  the swedish word in turn sounds like they got it from northern italy where modern banking was invented while * all * of central and nothern europe was still in the stoneage , 
  sz\u00e9kely ... something something medieval total war ? 
  just the kind of unexpected adorable lunatics we love the otherwise rational english for . 
  snort, 
  sound idea . 
  did n't they want to go solar anyway ? 
  turkey might be interested , they love nuclear plants and would get rid of all their neighbours they hate anyway . 
  japan could even keep the option of border disputes with russia . 
  hey , as long as the purpose is having a go at them , even the americans can into europe . 
  username checks out, 
  well , there 's always reverse trianon but did that even change the borders with croatia ? 
  * the `` debt crisis '' can not in any way sensibly be described as `` the failure of the euro '' ( as a side note , since 2008 the euro constantly remained stronger than the dollar , until 2015 and even then it was just the dollar getting stronger ) * the idea that europe did n't trade a lot before the euro is plain wrong . 
  in fact , trade increase was less than anticipated * removal of tariffs has nothing to do with the euro * the relationship between preventing war , unifying europe and enabling trade as described is the wrong way round . 
  on top of that the ec/eu was never about `` free trade '' but rather regulated trade in a unified market that guaranteed everyones interdependency , prosperity and thus security . 
  the free trade meme constantly slips in , understandably , in this video because it after all is a propaganda video * the removal of trade barriers started pretty much * after * `` rebuilding europe '' following the war , with the exception of the steel and coal union perhaps * however , the steel and coal union was pretty much the opposite of free trade . 
  while it removed trade tariffs it created a lot of regulation on who had to buy from whom and who had to support whom . 
  the effect on rebuilding was limited . 
  rebuilding was neither the professed nor actual reason to create the union * the way the fall of the wall and the creation of the eu ( really just an edited ec ) are connected is outright funny * the vid hits rock bottom when it compares greeks and germans . 
  pure populism . 
  retirement age is different , yes , and tax collection is less efficient in greece but the way it 's decribed is intolerable * german past deficit spending is nothing to scoff at . 
  german austerity happened only against the welfare system and working population , not in the form of debt reduction or not creating new debt . 
  nothing but ( german politician 's ) propaganda . 
  suggesting that germany was more responsible while creating the same relative mind boggling debt as greece is nonsense . 
  it just so happens that in a global pool of unattractive lending/investment options , germany is relatively attractive and thus stayed solvent - but that is mostly psychology , as is much of the finance system anyway * everyone is borrowing/lending from and to everyone . 
  globally . 
  this is - again - not a euro thing . 
  it is the exact way how the crisis started - european banks holding us-american bonds securities etc. 
  * making this about german values is , again , populist . 
  the demands are those of the imf essentially and they are and were always the same - globally : turn your country into cheap wage slaves by making them poor , taking their rights , destroying social security , sell public property for cheap etc. 
  i still heartily disagree with your interpretation and feel my interpretation is confirmed by your link but at this point i guess we can agree to disagree . 
  i 'm not denying it 's real just saying it must be relatively confined - thankfully . 
  wow , this is so glaringly inaccurate i would hide in shame if i was bloomberg . 
  i guess it 's a good thing i 've never heard of this controversy ... ? 
  not sure ... yeah , i 'm gon na go with the whole idea is so absurd and obscure that i 've never heard of it . 
  i got `` bad '' news for you . 
  it 's mostly a ruse . 
  almost all those people who are caught off shore and brought to some dinky island eventually are granted asylum and transferred to the mainland . 
  however , there are ridiculously few compared to europe so it 's all good . 
  except that is not notwehr . 
  assaulting someone who flees because he stole something is not notwehr . 
  you 're drunk , go home . 
  so what did they steal ? 
  * picturing the faces of the migrants arriving in serbia , looking around , and going `` oh my god , we are in eastern europe '' eurotrip style *  edit : then quickly making for hungary thinking it 's any different, 
  not me . 
  also , since when is 51 % most ? 
  also , this kind of thinking is only found with people who do n't know anything about economics - which , granted , is about 80 % of population everywhere . 
  this cute little idea that anything for anyone gets better - or even changes at all - if the currency is different . 
  edit : til the term `` slim majority '' has been expunged from the english language . 
  it 's a brave new world . 
  edit edit : alright , i guess it makes sense for a country where people think a minority is the majority , that `` most '' starts at 51 % . 
  it should in fact start even earlier because certainly a government represents most people ... 
  well , the album title is carolus rex and that 's normally referring to karl xii . 
  but what my point really is is fighting for a king is quite stupid . 
  fight for a german wittelsbacher of a palatinate line ? 
  i guess i could go for that .
