  but why really would a swede do that ? 
  edit : is n't he also the guy who lost the war , the empire and indirectly turned sweden into a kind of democracy ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnmg-k1br6u the enemy is not some nation far across the sea the enemy is with us every single breathing day so yes , i will fight for my country the land that i love so well yes , for justice , a land fit for all our futures yes , i will fight for my country the land that i love so well hear the voices of our history echo all around fight all the ones who divide us rich against poor fight all the ones who divide us white against black fight all the ones who want their missiles in our earth fight all the powers who would lead us into war, 
  they tried to send interviewers there but the russians would n't let them in . 
  osman did nothing wrong , 
  carpet beater . 
  plastic stiring spoon . 
  we do n't have coal related spills in our rivers . 
  we do n't have unregulated and forgotten coal mining garbage right next to our drinking water sources . 
  we do n't have companies laughing in our face when we tell them to clean it up . 
  but maybe soon we will have companies - not even american ones , that 's not the point - that make us hand over tax money as `` lost profits '' because we make them clean up pollution . 
  the asse comes to mind . 
  imperialism . 
  right . 
  oh great , more jeff trolling, 
  '' ** a ** free trade and investment agreement between the european union and the united states '' the question was n't even about ttip or whether certain parts of it are bad . 
  they might as well ask about support for `` a fair free trade and investment agreement between the european union and the united states '', 
  now define * progressive * left-wing * conservative * right-wing i 'll give you ` pragmatic ' for now but it 's problematic too . 
  i ca n't speak for all germans but personally i think its good that you like your ~ ~ weird ~ ~ cheese and i like ours ( and by that i mean mostly dutch and swiss ) . 
  it 's one less thing to go to war over . 
  we 'll still need some tribute payments in the form of comt\u00e9 and raclette but that seem to work out . 
  hehe . 
  hehehe . 
  he chose the white sauce . 
  he does n't know about the white sauce . 
  hehe . 
  alas , the russians are already displacing you . 
  again . 
  such sad fate . 
  it 's cute how you pretend norwegians would understand danes . 
  well , unless they speak english . 
  yours maybe , i have no points :p, 
  agreed , but if you know that the austrians are in bavaria only and hardly any french would * ever * go to germany you can tell the rest of the colours apart . 
  looks like inheritance from the sowjet era, 
  with a sample size of just ~ 1000 , a value of 40 vrs 58 is just random fluctuation to me . 
  except maybe for the danish gypsie value all values are indentical unless you are a gullible statistics fanboy . 
  pegida is disgusting but also ultimately harmless . 
  it did n't really get any traction outside of dresden and the number of people involved was n't that big , especially if we assume that many of them came from outside of dresden . 
  fp\u00d6 , fn , hungary etc. 
  are a whole other level both in quantity and quality . 
  the poor dogs . 
  also , what is the fox eating ? 
   i vaguely remember this one . 
  even as a child i found it wonderfully scandalous how open it , well , seemed to be about sexuality . 
  i mean , there are 2 people getting it on * right in the intro !, 
  nude people !, 
  ** this time not us !, 
  this time not us !, 
  this time not us !, 
  ** it leaves me strangely horrified yet smug that so many european countries are now more fascist than germany . 
  ( please save your comments on how fascism was a specific movement in a specific country at a specific time . 
  we all know what i mean ), 
  true , on second thought , the food is n't * always * great . 
  memory tends to keep the highlights . 
  then again , is n't that true for all countries ? 
  i also tend to stay away from touristy places and try to eat where locals eat . 
  oh , you have those too ( the drones ) ? 
  germany can into portugal , yay !, 
  this looks a lot like people are to dumb to use search engines and the adress bar properly . 
  well , that 's some solid research there . 
  `` we have this guy here who gave us an interview about his supersecret mission on how he smuggles terrorists into europe . '', 
  right . 
  in b4 ... oh , too late . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delphi http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiryns http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mycenae http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argos http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olympia,_greece http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epidaurus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_corinth etc etc and of course athens and the islands it 's all the legendary places and they are real and still there . 
  and , you know , the food is great too . 
  edit : when you are done and liked it , move on to western turkey . 
  the us northwest and california . 
  it helps you understand why everything has to be huge and simple for us-americans . 
  it 's like god took his first draft of europe , still a rectangle , placed only the alps and 2 or 3 big rivers in it and dropped it like that . 
  even the trees are taller . 
  the towns are mostly one storey , flat and like chessboards so they take up a multiple of the space they would occupy in europe . 
  it makes sense then that everything humans make from roads to cars to rvs to portion sizes has to be bigger too . 
  do n't spend much time in the towns though , enjoy the nature . 
  you can easily get further away from civilization than anywhere in europe . 
  i guess the mid-west would work too . 
  literally nothing but endless corn fields . 
  it 's a bit like esc in here ; i ca n't vote for myself so i 'll vote for my neighbour xd, 
  that 's a bit oversimplified . 
  no one knows who moved where during the migration period . 
  we do know that slavs later moved into the area . 
  the language and culture today certainly is n't celtic . 
  that being said , there still might be a `` genetic '' celtic substratum today . 
  i think it would work for germany . 
  we ~ ~ hate ~ ~ totally love slavs , arabs and africans equally and there are no germanic refugees anyway . 
  edit : germany should however habe dibs on slavs from ex-yugoslavia . 
  such nice reunion moments : herr babic , herr kovacic , frau vukovic , sie hier ? 
  edit : guys ? 
  really ? 
  no satire allowed ? 
  german tourists then , german tourists now . 
  not much change , 
  you should have a look at some suburbs in texas ... or fracking centers . 
  really the same thing . 
  as if people are smiling in , say , most american supermarkets . 
  maybe they are more on the angry or stressed out side , but smiling ? 
  i do n't want to argue with you over the meaning of shelving versus suspending , suffice to say what i read is they are just as fully determined to put isds in . 
  dont believe propagandajeff without carefully reading his `` sources '' . 
  nowhere does it say the eu shelved negotiations on isds . 
  on the contrary , they still want it in , they are just delaying it hoping attention will be off later . 
  where in that document do you read that ?
