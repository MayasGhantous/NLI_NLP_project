  it started under the supposedly left-wing spd government of the late 90s and it got increasingly worse during the following 3 conservative govs in a row . 
  these `` mini-jobs '' were supposed to be low number of hours per week , help you get back into a regular job , act as `` auxiliary income '' , for students , spouses where the other spouse has a full job and health insurance is already covered etc. 
  but it is now not uncommon to - illegaly - work a lot more hours than you are paid for and have 2 or 3 of those jobs . 
  `` geringf\u00fcgige besch\u00e4ftigung '' is the official term ; insignificant work . 
  at least 5 million of these contracts exist , replacing proper contracts and the government is just looking away . 
  you can look at it from any angle you want , state/federal debt of the us is way higher than ... you know what , i 'll just leave it at * `` countries that have it are going bankrupt '' * says the guy from the country that just had to shut down gov services because of debt ceiling * without universal health care adding to it * . 
  that reminds me of something ... odd . 
  when i was backpacking in england as a tourist your neighbourhood watch signs made * me * feel unsafe . 
  like i was an intruder , being watched from every window , behind the curtains . 
  i felt less comfortable striking up a conversation or simply asking for directions . 
  maybe that 's just because i 'm german though , 
  story checks out ; no potatoes in nordjylland . 
  so that 's the wrong spot to comment that ireland ( 329,000 ) does n't count as `` abroad '' ? 
  from left to right : 1 ) i am way to civilized to threaten anyone . 
  2 ) i am a nice person but do n't underestimate me !, 
  3 ) who 's army is next to roll right over me ? 
  4 ) i am a true maniac and i will rule the world * cackle * edit : btw , first lady is norway , second is sweden . 
  just look how that shit turns out in practice in britain . 
  or australia . 
  or any other country that has/d something similar . 
  the real criminals easily circumvent it while the government uses it to arbitrarily and secretly censor whatever they want , either maliciously or by incompetence . 
  circumventing the proposed block would have been as easy as watching a blocked youtube video . 
  you would n't even need a vpn . 
  i have annexed flanders many times . 
  eventually they turn protestant or even reformed and give you nothing but trouble , really . 
  for some reason i read that in a north korean voice , but really i was just thinking of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:cannabis_plant.jpg ) stereotype . 
  much statement so know how vest, 
  not the plant i expected from the netherlands ... 
  you know guys , maybe it 's some kind of language barrier but do any of these links show what the texts claims ?

  no wonder the data is skewed . 
  it is a reddit staple to state '' [ dictator x ] or [ king y ] did nothing wrong . '', 
  preferably with historical figures that are worshipped by one faction and abhored by another but everything works . 
  oh yeah , that bastion of freedom was so totally of value to the freedom loving people of other european countries in the past . 
  we ca n't lose that !, 
  yeah , the german term gaga comes to mind . 
  no , not the musician . 
  it means cray cray in an infantile way .

  if you think most other countries do n't have the exact same shit you are mistaken , 
  i like the song , but the video * cringe so hard *, 
  the swiss and norwegian seem to be doing pretty well , technically not being eu but effectively sharing all agreements they want to by bilateral means . 
  i do n't see why catalonia should have trouble negotiating similar terms . 
  i am no expert but i do n't think spain can veto those . 
  catalonia could decide not to introduce customs controls and the only other relevant party would be france . 
  spain would only hurt itself making problems for all the through traffic from and to valencia and further south .

  `` alice '' is an absolute staple of german drunks at every beer or wine fest . 
  male and female . 
  cheap coverbands at such fests will play it `` hoch and runter '' as we say . 
  i hate it . 
  it is one of the few opportunities where the average german can loosen up , get totally shitfaced - and absolutely rude . 
  i think many people do n't realize what they are singing . 
  yes , we do n't censor lyrics , german or english , on radio or anywhere else . 
  for germans this us/uk habit is somewhere between annoying , cute and ridiculous . 
  the only music ever censored was some deutschpunk and nazirock but they quickly realized that makes the music only more popular . 
  if anything is censored , it is simply not played at all but that is rare . 
  for some time it was `` good manners '' for bands to jokingly put `` warnung , explizite lyric '' stickers on cds . 
  a full answer would probably be quite complex but here are a few pointers : * us and uk music is `` cool '' , has been for decades . 
  rec companies perceive it as much more safe and profitable to push only those bands . 
  there already is a giant home market so there is more money for advertising and `` testing '' a band in a different country . 
  * there is a fear that singing in another language might sound uncool , especially for an international market . 
  that leaves only the national market and for most european countries that means there is only a small niche market . 
  sure , a french band might still decide to sing in english but they would eg have to be fluent or have a cute accent . 
  obstacles , obstacles . 
  of course there are exceptions like manu negra and manu chao that mostly sing spanish or french but are popular , well , in a lot of countries , but companies decide and that brings us to the next point : * record companies push mostly a few of their expected big sellers . 
  they * pay * radio to play only these songs . 
  the dj is usually not at liberty to play anything else . 
  advertising makes it worse : an advertiser will place ads mostly with stations that play music for its core market ; the young crowd - that listens to teen pop . 
  there probably is music in local/other languages in every european country but it is usually more folksy , not pop or rock , played on different stations and organized as an entirely separate market or simply not well known enough to be played on mainstream stations at all . 
  if you want to hear non-mainstream non-english music you have to search and/or know where to look . 
  in germany specifically there now is a fair amount of german artists and german language lyrics played , thanks to successful german rap , deutsche h\u00e4rte and terrible shows like voice of germany but i 'd say 80 % is still english .

  it 's a deal !, 
  good question . 
  why is anyone racist ? 
  too little education and firm prejudices ? 
  from a strategic pov it probably is a safe way to satisfy a large part of their voters ' base . 
  we are working on that . 
  greetings , your friendly racist csu neighbours . 
  well yeah , that way round it works  or so i am told . 
  rightfully so . 
  they did . 
  bok is the variant of norwegian closer to dsh . 
  not sure i agree they are mutually understandable though . 
  you are looking at it all wrong . 
  of all the irritating horse invader people you are the only one to carve out an empire that lasts till today , surrounded by people that speak gibberish . 
  nowhere does it say so . 
  let 's call it ` fairly well mutually intelligible ' , k ? 
  catalan and italian may have started off as kinda dialects of vulgar latin but calling them that now is a bit off . 
  not really . 
  see the key ? 
  that allows for that kind of line even at value 100 ie total divergence . 
  that line is more for flavor than for actual data . 
  also , to further nitpick , the map does not show actual relation but just overlapping vocabulary . 
  all of it is arbitrary , dialect and language borders are mostly blurred . 
  there are surprisingly few national languages that are real actual amalgams of their constituent dialects .
