  we are however short a few nuclear plants ... * evilchuckle, 
  the link to ejer bjerge has no links to other languages . 
  obvious fake but nice try , denmark , 
  nono . 
  denmark is one big grassy flat with windturbines on it , and a few miles of coast . 
  nothing will shake my belief in this . 
  it is easy to check ; grab the little man and hold and hover over the map ; coverage is actually less than displayed . 
  dont be silly !, 
  trolls live in forests and caves , denmark has neither . 
  heheheee ... 
  my home is my castle is actually more true in germany than anywhere else . 
  the true reason though is that google is pouting like a baby and trying to punish the bad bad germans for their low compliance . 
  touch\u00e9 , 
  indeed . 
  i was just pointing out that op 's wording while having its own shortcomings is less ambiguos . 
  ( because internet , if you happen to frequent / r/linguistics ), 
  spread awareness . 
  ppp kills the future and the capacity of municipalities to act . 
  to be fair , it is more clear than the article 's `` david cameron urged not to water down the freedom of information act '' he urged what now ? 
  yeah ... 
  or ... switzerland  sure , there 's a lot of issues to be resolved . 
  those who have claims to pensions could have that sum guaranteed in excess of the ge . 
  the rent discussion is complex and important but 2 eckpunkte : * the current housing market wo n't / ca n't change overnight * cheap housing , at least in most cities , is already rare and this kind of separation already exists . 
  it could worsen , sure . 
  living in an attractive yet expensive city would be the first reason to work on top of the ge though , no ? 
  the reichsarbeitsdienst targeted only a specific part of the population - the poor , uneducated , diadvantaged , powerless . 
  just the opposite of what i suggest . 
  compare it instead with compulsory military service , the zivildienst , fsj , bfd and f\u00d6j . 
  also , modalities would of course have to be worked out but i do n't take people serious who whine about how e.g. 
  a one month break from their job will ruin their career yet have no trouble spending the same time on vaccation . 
  germany also manages to get fathers and mothers back into their job after mutterschutz of at least 14 weeks and elternzeit of up to 3 years . 
  lastly , our workforce for these `` attractive '' jobs is too small and shrinking so this point is moot too . 
  to me your fears are fiction , and a decades old one at that . 
  you are just proving my point . 
   * whether such a basic-income scheme might have some appeal for other , less socialist countries too . 
  * snort . . the swiss . . socialists . . you americans , so funny , never gets old, 
  you are about 40 years late . 
  where it was at all feasable all of that already happened and lookit , we are still alive . 
  95 % of asians can not afford european products and never could and that which is n't produced in china these days comes from bangladesh . 
  you also seem to be assuming that wages would stay the same on top of the unconditional basic wage - why would they . 
  there are ( iirc , for germany ) - admittedly partial - calculations that it would n't cost the state much more - if it 's done properly , that is , the current costs for burocracy , staff , supervision , controls etc. 
  are done away with . 
  on the matter of unconditional and cost offset , i am also all for some kind of general mandatory civil service , preferably in several work areas like garbage removal and sorting , all kinds of cleaners , hospitals , homes for the elderly , any night shift / emergency jobs , manual farm work , mail and parcel delivery ... preferably also not just one or two years at 18ish but in several chunks during one 's life . 
  my hope is that this would help with noticing all these little `` cogs and wheels '' that we tend to take for granted , would improve our willingness to pay decently for hard or dirty manual labor and might even improve those workplaces or environmental conditions where normally employees have neither the power nor time to change anything tl ; dr we should not only redistribute wealth but also work, 
  capitalism mindset means everything is competition , every citizen is your enemy . 
  no rest , no peace , no safety . 
  the only thing that counts is being better and by extension the best . 
  you do n't even have to be good , it 's enough to ruin those who are better than you and all dirty tricks are allowed as long as no one catches you . 
  only one company , one athlete , one person per field counts - the rest have failed and must perish . 
  capitalism means those who already have money - without any merit - have a headstart over you you can only even out with a lot of luck , not talent , not hard work , and no matter who , only a few ever will . 
  chances that you , child , will be one of them are really slim . 
  i think we * should * teach children more what capitalism is - they have a knack for calling out bullshit . 
  can i just say , as a german , that i am not afraid of inflation ? 
  and that , validity of the article 's position aside , britain ( which is really not britain at all but just a bunch of politicians and journalists like everywhere ) has a notorious ( and thus boring ) `` all is doomed , we knew it '' position on anything regarding eu and the monetary union ? 
  not seing even a hint of the euro failing . 
  i see a debt crisis that is both inherent in our capitalist money system , caused by gov overspending everywhere and triggered by moronic actions of the financial sector . 
  the euro ? 
  as much part of it as the dollar . 
  i feel someone is taking revenge on german ignorance of the east ... 
   men have to sit down to pee . 
  ftfy, 
  war guilt helped us realize that you can live just fine without waving and saluting a flag and singing about how free your country is ( when it 's not ) . 
  i have never seen this ... i feel old . 
  for me , it 's a love hate relationship . 
  * yes , the public transport network is pretty dense , especially compared to other countries - but it was a lot better and could and should be better . 
  local lines are often not run by die bahn any more but by local companies because those idiots high up thought they were not viable . 
  * yes , die bahn is expensive , but you can make it a lot cheaper if you know the rules and tricks . 
  * die bahn is often ( just ) a little late ( < 5 min ) , which should n't hurt anyone but thanks to misguided network policies you may lose your connecting train and delays add up . 
  it is a common perception that schedules are timed too tightly thus what theoretically saves 5 mins effectively costs 5 mins . 
  notorious downplaying by management that there are delays with statistic shenanigans also does n't help - do n't tell your customer he is lying !, 
  * die bahn tries to compete with air traffic which is plain stupid and hurts local connections . 
  in the same vein , money is wasted on prestigious , risky projects ( like s21 ) and new expensive tunnel/bridge rich tracks instead of things like track maintenance and improvement . 
  * hanging on to train transport for both people and freight makes sense as it can only become more viable and ecofriendly in the future with oil prices rising . 
  i guess that is a matter of definition ... besides , the idea of women getting raped `` at home '' instead of `` on the streets '' somehow does n't make me any happier . 
  most certainly looking up the number of rape convictions of the last decades would show that yes , indeed , puzzling , rape is not a muslim invention and `` dutch working class boys ** were ** raping girls on the streets 50 years ago '' ** a lot ** . 
  i am not seeing the `` big implications '' part in the least . 
  they * may * get some publicity - that i doubt will help them get better election results - and more funding - which they will use to fill their pockets , like most other politicians . 
  besides the article already lists the parties that will not join and why the whole thing will fail , again . 
  good guy usa , has * heard * of filters, 
  to be fair , polyclinic and endoscopy * are * probably the same in swedish . 
  and that 's how easy trade agreements are done . 
  i am looking at you , us , eu !, 
  not that i disagree . 
  and since you mentioned the free world : i hear there is an initiative in congress that wants to change the anthem 's line to `` land of surveillance and the home of the eavesdropping . '', 
  personally , i feel it sounds a bit awkward , 
  now , now , think about it . 
  in * every * sex tape there is a man you do n't care for . 
  but maybe the lady is superhot ? 
  lingonberry jam is a serious matter in sweden !, 
  i am probably making this up but there might even be export limitations in place . 
  it is hard to estimate how the `` common man '' feels but generally i would say there is more anger now but it is more about being insulted that `` friends '' spy on our government than being worried about personal data security . 
  what i meant is the term and the connection with any rand . 
  obviously the idea comes across just fine or the artists would n't have chosen it . 
  but they all do agree that ayn rand 's ramblings are superficial and dysfunctional ? 
  ( and of course the idea of `` following the herd like a sheep instead of thinking for yourself '' is a very general one ), 
  you would have to ask the artists but i doubt this is directed more towards the nsa than the german government - and the german population who does n't do much more than shrug about the topic . 
  the whole sheeple thing is pretty much unknown in germany - and presumably most of europe . 
  no one knows ayn rand either - we are too smart for that shit :p, 
  thanks . 
  too soon,
