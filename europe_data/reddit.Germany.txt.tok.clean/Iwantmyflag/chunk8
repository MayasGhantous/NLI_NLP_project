  would the young usa of , say , 1799 , support britain or [ a maniac dictator bent on conquering the world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon ) ? 
  just be happy you do n't have this shitty 2-euro coin by a greek `` artist '' . 
  hate breeds hate and kills reason ; the ** english ** spread quite a bit of that in ireland for centuries . 
  he did however never really say that . 
  so swedes are the better germans ? 
  so this is the wrong place to complain about the tiny amount of snow that promptly melted and how it is delaying the flowering of my peaches and how i ca n't work in the garden in a shirt ? 
  well done . 
  yeah , i thought at first keepthepace is being ironic ... 
  look at it like this : in spain ( as everywhere else ) the situation is this : the banks ( along with a lot of other crooks ) have been bailed out with tax payer money and these crooks now proceed to evict and put out of work these taxpayers and send them into actual real poverty . 
  this affects so many people that there are actually chances for a new social contract . 
  if you look at your own constitution and history you may learn that part of that is nullifying older contracts in one way or another . 
  i am surprised and proud that spain , going from a feudal society right into a devastating civil war and then a brutal dictatorship that wiped out any opposition and ended only ~ 35 years ago , seems to have more guts and social cohesion than the rest of europe . 
  well , see , the locksmiths have already declared they refuse , so i guess next step is to ask the guy with the heavy cutting equipment ... 
  public good does n't mean free . 
  it means too important to have the crazy assholes at the stock market handle it . 
  are we rich ? 
  yes ( comparatively , even portugal ) . 
  is drinking water cheap ? 
  yes ( compared to electricity , gas and bottled branded water e.g. ) . 
  do we want it to be safe and possibly more expensive in turn ? 
  you decide . 
  do we want to risk people dying or depopulating regions because they could n't affort water or because it took `` the market '' 10 years to make supplying water `` profitable '' again ? 
  do we think `` the market '' is reliable and trustworthy ? 
  these days ? 
  really ? 
  you do ? 
  dude , are you from africa or the moon ? 
  yes , most of food/land/transportation / healthcare/internet connection/cellphones , ( well , maybe not tooth-brushes ... ) are often publicly handled , if not subsidized and if not heavily regulated and whereever that is not the case , shit hits the fan . 
  reddits current favorite example is internet connections in the usa . 
  careful guys . 
  `` economists '' above . 
  talking pointless , they live in a different universe concerned with making it sound ethical to be an asshole . 
  both actually . 
  in germany , drinking water is nationalized . 
  more precisely , communally owned . 
  even indebted and abandoned houses usually do n't have their drinking water cut off . 
  not sure the latter is due to a law . 
  and you thanked him so heartily 1772 and 1795 , 
  bloody danes , always stronger than one thinks ... 
  dammit , now i want to play europa universalis again . 
  i ca n't speak for thereaperr but looking back at the various rebel factions in algeria , the crazy dictator in libya , the recent revolutions in the maghreb and the series of civil wars and coups in both west and central africa , i 'd say there is n't that much left to destabilize and we are pretty safe . 
  the extremists are indeed not the same as the tuareg . 
  does n't change the fact that france is down there because every dead mali tuareg ( or extremist ) is one less tuareg making trouble in niger . 
  frankly , i do n't care much if mali is governed by `` taliban '' . 
  ca n't be worse than the slavery next door in mauritania or the us-allied fundamentalist dictatorship in saudi arabia . 
  it came as quite the surprise to all of us that no one except france was interested in protecting a pro-european sentiment/gov in the country that borders right on `` their '' largest uranium mine ( niger ) , crucial for french power supply . 
  the french intervention therefore also has nothing to do with the tuareg `` insurgents '' that recently returned from libya to both mali and niger and never were happy that their traditional grazing grounds are now sold to foreign companies and poisoned forever . 
   unless the giving gdp 's are substantially larger than the receiving gdp 's . 
  that 's mostly true . 
  and for the less gullible in the audience : look how neatly we pulled out of this financial mess despite probably being deeper in it than greece or ireland . 
  would n't you want to join the guy who knows all the dirty tricks ? 
  indeed . 
  here 's another : who invented triathlon ? 
  the poles : walk to the public swimming pool , go home by bike . 
  asuming our companies pay any taxes ... ( well , also employment rate may be higher and the economy as a whole profits ), 
  tradition . 
  until you know that all poles are ** bloody lazy thieves !!!, 
  ** ( i am aware that a lot of poles are in fact working hard in various neighbour-ish countries ), 
  well , i personally am confident i can place most if not all us states on a map and i know at least one bit of trivia about most of them . 
  heck , i even know some of the capitals  but that 's hardly average , yes . 
  that 's how that works ?? 
  i read one had to request it from a bot and that never worked ... derp . 
  thanks . 
  now . . how do i change my account name , 
  i 'm too slow for this thread, 
  both flags do in fact have similar myths on how they came to be . 
  florida , disneyland , tourists are murdered . 
  louisiana , katrina and everyone is racist . 
  like the rest of the south . 
  ny state because we know ny city but that there are 2 confuses us . 
  utah with the mormons . 
  kentucks cos kfc . 
  west virginia because everyone has been tortured with that song . 
  absurdistan is missing from that image of supposedly european flags . 
  you know absurdistan , it 's situated between georgia and turkey . 
  right next to iran which while we are at it * really * should be considered european too , no ? 
  um . . but that 's obviously malta in the op comic . 
  your `` explain '' made me think this will be a long night . 
  but then gladly i read your second sentence ; yes , that sums it up neatly . 
  err . . they do n't even ** have ** the euro . 
  only finland has and they are not strictly scandinavian . 
  absolutely the norm in germany . 
  except in places like restaurants where you give a tip anyway . 
  but not exactly common . 
  pretty much all prices end in 9s , some in 5s ; 0.89 $ , 4.99 $ , 139 $ , sometimes even 199.99 $ . 
  a quick look at my last receit shows 18 items with x.x9 $ and 4 with x.x5 $ and you typically pay the exact sum . 
  probably worth more than 10 $, 
  it 's been years for me but it 's always been fun :d edit : as a touristy type you get a great free `` oh poor you , did those scots give you trick money ? '', 
  look on top . 
  because , with the way economy works currently , if you continue that long term you will become the 3rd world country you are ripping off right now . 
  like india and especially china are demonstrating so nicely for us . 
  there is this cute notion that cheaper production elsewhere is not based on the lowering of any standard they can find and that transport cost magically does n't exist . 
  it 's a myth . 
  the best joke is that many nations have a policy or even law that urges to balance out exports and imports but none do . 
  now , now , we want to export our stuff and crush other markets , not import their stuff . 
  so we only do free trade agreements with nations when trade already is pretty relaxed . 
  there are also usually more hooks and catches in these agreements than actual deregulations . 
  what 's the point in this if both sides still subsidize products and regulate prices ? 
  was n't this whole deal about preventing china to get all the precious oil from tar sands anyway ? 
  so much self-burn in this thread ,
