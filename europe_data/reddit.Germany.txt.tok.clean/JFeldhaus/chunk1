  is there a chart for entire alcohol consumption , beer and wine included ? 
  i have to agree . 
  although there is a great emphasis on learning english in school , when everything is available in german there is not enough interaction with the language to become proficient . 
  typically the average guy will have an a2-b1 proficiency level which is enough for short conversations and getting around on vacations but that 's where it stops . 
  edit : you 're from spain so you should know this first hand , all those undereducated tourists we 're sending to you every year that flat out refuse to talk anything but german , it 's ridiculous !, 
  if you work in a bar or hotel on mallorca or lorret de mar you pretty much have to speak german because those tourist expect you to . . 
  frankly i have to agree . 
  this has changed a bit for the younger generation because of the internet but overall germany has a very closed german language ( dubbed or self produced ) entertainment culture unlike smaller nations such as the netherlands or scandinavia .

  she was having a nervous breakdown , in that situation , anything could have happen if she had a gun . 
  she could have shot the guy or hurt herself accidentally . 
  because of the abundance of guns and the willingness to use them this kind of situation is far more dangerous in the us than in europe . 
  please show me the law where it says that you can buy a rocket launcher and stock up on explosive ammunition for no specific purpose . 
  of course you can get stuff like that for very specific circumstances ( like i remember the mythbusters getting a rocket for some sort of experiment ) but the ammunition will be under supervision the entire time . 
  there is no chance you can get these weapons to start a revolution . 
  the `` most powerful '' weapon you could legally buy is arguably an assault rifle , what do you want to do with that ? 
  storm the whitehouse ? 
  and then what ? 
  what do you want to do if the tanks roll in ? 
  the idea of an armed revolution against the us government is a conservative fairy tale , completely dislodged with reality . 
  if you go by that principle , citizens should be allowed to buy tanks and rocket launchers . 
  in germany there was a court that ruled [ `` that religious circumcision of male children amounts to bodily injury , and is a criminal offense in the area under its jurisdiction '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circumcision_and_law#germany ) . 
  sadly the government gave in to pressure from jewish and muslim groups and adopted a law that made it legal again . 
  the problem is the gun culture really , the `` shoot first '' mentality . 
  here is a story which made me realize this : a few years ago my uncle had an american exchange student , a girl about 18 years old , staying at his house for 6 months . 
  one saturday evening my aunt and uncle were out having dinner with friends , she stayed home . 
  at about 11 my uncle got a very hysteric call from her and the only thing she said was `` there is some one out there , where do you keep your gun ?? '' . 
  after she calmed down she explained that she locked herself up in the bathroom after she saw someone in the garden . 
  naturally her first instinct was to look for a gun and from her experience in the us she assumed everyone keeps a gun somewhere . 
  we live in germany and of course my uncle does n't own a gun or even knows anyone who does . 
  next morning they find out that it was the neighbor 's kid who drunkenly went through the wrong gate , looked around and then left the garden realizing his mistake . 
  he came over to apologize because he trampled over some flowers in the front . 
  if my uncle owned a gun , that kid would probably be dead . 
  do you really think in the time of fully automated killing drones , an angry mob with hunting rifles could topple the us government ? 
  just like if your religion says you have to disfigure your newborn 's genitals , you would get jai ... oh wait . . 
  even funnier : montserrat ( uk ) , there a total was 1 murder which means they have a homicide rate of 20.4 which is the 24th highest in the world . 
  invading ? 
  nah mate , we are just returning the fire . . 
  rommel light please . 
  yeah lets just let them die  fuck human rights !, 
  looked at the wrong numbers , it 's 15,500 for the czech , edited my post . 
   yeah thats 2015 , what about next year ? 
  there are only so many refugees . 
  we 're getting the bulk of them right now , the influx does n't last forever . 
  additionally , if we make clear that you do n't automatically get to stay in germany or sweden if you come here , there is a lower incentive to make the trip . 
  right now the refugees come here because they know they have much better chances to survive . 
  you 're right !, 
  it 's just about welfare !, 
  the civil war in syria is just a false flag operation !, 
  here are some rough numbers based on current estimates for 2015 , if we distribute the refugees equally over the eu :  ** poland : ** 59,000 refugees  ** hungary : ** 15,000 refugees  ** slovakia : ** 8,500 refugees  ** czech republic : ** 15,500 refugees ** total v4 : ** 98,000 refugees that 's just about 1/10th of what germany is expecting to take in this year alone for an area with 100 million people . 
  do n't tell me you ca n't handle that . 
  and 500k ? 
  where do you even get that number from ? 
  that 's ridiculous fearmongering and you know it . 
  just keep telling yourself that , i 'm sure it helps you 're conscience . 
  those 2 million people crammed in turkish camps are all fine right ? 
  and this attitude is why the eu is probably better off without you . 
  if you think it 's best for your country to discard solidarity and refuse to take in a tiny number of refugees that have a right to asylum according to treaties your country signed then i think it 's best for my country to refuse solidarity in the form of structural funds flowing to your country . 
  if the refugees were distributed equally there would n't be any crisis . 
  croatia would have to take in a whopping 6.000 refugees , do n't tell me that 's gon na ruin your country . 
  they were asked to take in 200 refugees which resulted in massive outrage . 
  we take all those refugees off their hands and still get blamed , wonderful !, 
   ( and altering the demographics structure definitely is ) if all middle eastern refugees since the beginning of the crisis were distributed equally over the eu , your country would be impacted by a whopping 0.3 % population increase consisting of refugees . 
  if other developed nations like the us , canada , australia and japan participated the impact would we so negligible , you would likely never see any of those refugees in person . 
  do n't tell me that 1,500 or less refugees would ruin your country . 
  do you mean we have to anschluss all those syrian refugees ? 
  oh the homeopaths in this country feel the drugs , did n't you follow the news ? 
  i have no idea what you are talking about . 
  a couple months back the eu made a plan to relocate 40,000 asylum seeker that were in urgent need of shelter , and distribute them to all of the member states , just because you accepted 200 of those does n't mean you take in as many refugees per capita as the rest of the eu does ? 
   we accepted 200 refugees which is the average per capita for eu . 
  moving the goal post again , eh ? 
  and you know damn well that these `` rumours '' about 40,000 refugees going to estonia is right wing scaremongering . 
  about 3,000 refugees would be eu average , 10,000 refugees would put you on the same level as germany , which will never happen . 
  you obviously have no idea what you are talking about . 
  anyways , the estonian average income would have to be 11x smaller than the eu average for you calculation to make sense . 
  so you started with `` get your facts straight . '', 
  and when you 're caught making shit up you just start moving the goal post ? 
  just accept it , 200 refugees is a joke . 
  adjusting for income does n't make any sense at all . 
  gdp per capita in estonia is $ 27,729 ( ppp , 2015 . est ) eu average is $ 36,699 so go figure . 
  does n't make your numbers look any better at all . 
   we accepted 200 refugees which is the average per capita for eu . 
  estonia population : 1.3 million , refugees 2015 : 200 refugees per capita : 0.00015 ( 6500 citizens per refugee ) getting a 2015 estimate for the eu is surprisingly difficult . 
  germany alone expects * more than * 650,000 refugees ( 0.007 per capita ; 126 citizens per refugee ) , austria estimates 80,000 + , sweden expects at least 70,000 . 
  even just with these 3 countries we 're looking at over 800,000 refugees . 
  eu population : 508 million , refugees ger , au , se 2015 : 800,000 refugees per capita : 0.0016 ( 635 citizens per refugee ) even if we use last years numbers you 're not close to average : eu refugees 2014 : 625,000 refugees per capita : 0.0012 ( 812 citizens per refugee ) you 're full of shit mate . 
  but the uk is getting overrun with refugees !, 
  i 'm not saying this is bad i just wanted to get the facts straight . 
  they 're adding to the population , contribute a bit of money and do n't compete for jobs . 
  in most cases this is a small net positive for the host country . 
  yes but that happened in their country of origin not where they retire . 
  they 're not paying income tax though . 
  all seed companies , including organic seed companies , patent and license seeds . 
  a seed does not have to be gmo to be patented . 
  the first seed patents were issued in the 1800s , long before gmos existed . 
  and monopolising of agriculture ? 
  that has n't got anything to do with gmos either . 
  and monsanto is n't even the biggest gmo company out there , syngena for instance is bigger and nobody seems to care about them .
