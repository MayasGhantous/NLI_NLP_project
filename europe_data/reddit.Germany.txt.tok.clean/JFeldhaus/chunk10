  you 're scapegoating . 
   they did n't `` dropped '' anything on the debt until facing a defacto defaut anyway because greece had ran out of money anyway and there was nothing left out to squeeze anymore . 
  why should anyone cut the debt if greece is not defaulting ? 
  in fact the way it has gone is extremely exceptional and formally virtually unheard off . 
   currently they 're not paying additionnal interests , but a large part is `` old debts '' that had run so high in a notable part to interests . 
  did you even read the relevant quotes i gave you about the psi ? 
  [ wikipedia  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private_sector_involvement#cite_note-group-4 )  part of that deal was a psi agreement , whereby private investors were asked to accept to write off 53.5 % of the ** face value ** of greek governmental bonds they 're holding , the equivalent to an ** overall loss of around 75 % ** . 
  the hair cut was agreed on ** face value ** , meaning 53.5 % of the principal and all associated interest on the `` old debt '' . 
  the result was a reduction of 75 % of all outstanding claims ( debt and interest ) against greece . 
  besides , why on earth do you think interest is fictitious debt ? 
  fundamentally financing is the the transfer of revenue from the future into the present , which is achieved e.g. 
  by loans , a service paid for by interest . 
  the greek government did n't have enough money for its spending program ( e.g. 
  welfare system ) therefore it took out loans as a service , which was paid for in the form of interest accordingly . 
  the problem is , the future revenue could neither pay for the spending program nor the service they used to finance it anyway . 
  which part of this is fictitious to you ? 
  should we all have just provided money for greek pensions without asking anything in return ? 
  entirely baseless accusations and completely besides the point . 
  even though military spending was way too high , even at its hight it did n't represent more that 3-4 % of the the greek expenses . 
   after how many months ? 
  in what way does this matter ? 
   about 40 % of what they owe to the troika ; that include any interests on repeatedly consolidated debts with additionnal new interests pilling up at every rounds . 
  most of the interest on the initial debt was extinguished as part of the psi and nowadays greece is paying next to nothing in interest so that claim is ridiculous . 
   except it did n't really because we only drove people to poverty , greek employees are largely left unpaid , and it 's quite showing in the greek example . 
  except it did because those loans which now represent the majority of the debt provided the greek people with pensions , healthcare and a huge public sector close to ( and in some cases above ) the standard of western european countries for decades . 
  what created the situation now is the lack of any means by the greek government to create the necessary revenue to sustain this system , a result of a complete lack of foresight , mismanagement , corruption , faking of economic statistics and out of proportion military spending . 
   and the way i see it , banks are simply stealing welfare ( ie food & housing money ) of the entire country for their own benefits in the name of fictive `` debts '' . 
  first of all contrary to popular opinion , the european banks which initially held most of the greek debt took a huge loss on this ordeal . 
  they * voluntarily * agreed to cut the greek debt * in half * which distinguished $ 106 billion in greek debt in one day . 
  additionally , why do you think any part of the debt is fictitious ? 
  a huge chunk of it was spent on welfare and all those things mentioned above in the decades leading up to the crisis . 
  let 's say you ask me for $ 400 to buy a new shiny bike and after 5 years i ask you for my money back . 
  you come to me and tell me you ca n't afford to pay me back so i just ask for $ 200 , over a period of 20 years , no interest charged under the only condition that you fix your spending problem .

  can we please stop with this meme already ? 
  the money reached the consumer years ago when the debt incured . 
   they could increase grace periods , lengthen maturities and reduce the interest rates towards zero is n't that exactly what has already happened and what germany has been trying to do instead of a nominal haircut for the last few years ? 
  if i recall correctly , payments of some of the loans have been extended to as far as the 2060s and all interest payments of efsf have been postponed until 2022 and even after that the interest will be something like 0.1 % . 
  on the other hand it 's the loans hold by imf and ecb that require a tighter repayment schedule and higher interest rates by statute . 
  it would make much more sense to cut down on those loans or transfer them to the efsf as well , so the exact opposite of what the imf wants to do . 
  i watched some interviews with people on the streets of vienna and one guy said something along the lines of `` oh this is just the president , you should vote for the one that you think can represent the country the best , the old guy or the slightly younger charismatic guy . '', 
  kinda frightens me that many people do n't see any clear distinction between a basically neo-fascist or thoroughly liberal candidate . 
   why then should the greek state and public pay for the risks taken by foreign private banks ? 
  let the market right itself and protect those that must be protected during the process . 
  greece has been participating in this market and therefore has to follow the obligations that come with it . 
  nobody forced greece to borrow from foreign investors , they made this decision themselves . 
  they borrowed money and spent it on various things including large infrastructure projects , a bloated public sector and high military spending . 
  you are suggesting a default , which , as i said , they can always do but that means they wo n't have any access to loans in the near to mid-term future which would make the country inoperable . 
  re-introduction of the drachme , devaluation and hyper-inflation would follow in one way or another . 
   the public was forced to pay and the bankers reaped the rewards and escaped unscathed . 
  did n't i just spend the last five posts explaining to you why this is n't true ? 
  unless you consider losing $ 106bn a * reward * and escaping * unscathed * . 
  besides , the public was among the huge beneficiaries of greece 's spending problems . 
  you just ca n't have western european social and living standards if your economy is more comparable to that of your east european neighbors . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  what greece is going through right now is a massive , nationwide downsizing effort which is neither fair nor enjoyable , but sadly , very necessary and the only sustainable solution . 
  the amount of foreign debt was way larger than that of greek banks . 
  it extinguished a lot more debt than was needed to recapitalize the greek banks . 
  besides , what are the alternatives in regards to the greek banks ? 
  a ) default on all privately hold debt : huge catastrophe due to partial default , plus the greek banks will need recapitalization as well . 
  b ) transfer debt to states but no haircut : you do n't get a debt reduction from all foreign debt so it 's a net negative . 
  the greek banks would need money either way , through recapitalization or just debt repayment . 
  i just do n't get what you think would have been the better move ? 
  debt to gdp ratio maybe a good indicator in a stable economy but when you are in such a severe depression it 's meaningless . 
  greece was on the brink of defaulting . 
  they lost access to the private equity market long before that . 
  it does n't matter what a rating agency thinks about your debt to gdp ratio if nobody is willing to buy your bonds . 
  at that point , greece was still running a massive deficit , was facing huge repayments coming up that they could n't afford and on top of that the high interest they were paying on the privately held bonds was making everything even worse . 
  they needed three things : * a fresh infusion of loans to keep things running * an extension of the repayment schedule to make the debt burden manageable * a drastic reduction in interest payments essentially they needed to cut the cost of servicing their debt to a minimum before they could even begin trying to balance the budget . 
  all of these things were achieved by the psi and transfer to public debt through the efsf and on top of that , the total debt load received a $ 106bn cut . 
  what are you trying to tell me with that graph ? 
  that 's ** debt to gdp ratio ** , of course when your [ gdp ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp ) is falling by about 14 % that year , the * ratio * does n't change by a huge amount . 
  the actual ** [ debt load ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-debt ) ** did change dramatically . 
  the private bond holders agreed to a 53 % face value debt cut which extinguished roughly ** $ 106bn ** in greek debt corresponding to roughly 28 % of total debt reduction . 
  again , you are just making stuff up to suit your narrative !,

   by the time of the psi , the main private debt holders where the greek pension funds , universities and banks that 's simply not true . 
  see a full report on the psi [ here ] ( http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5343&amp;context=faculty_scholarship ) , with a handy table of all the main bond holders [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m3lk5vf.png ) . 
  do you just make this stuff up ? 
  these countries are mostly small so they do n't have giant militaries but they do spent on defence pretty much on par as a percentage of their gdp with the rest of nato countries so i do n't know what you 're getting at . 
  the `` value '' nato is getting out of this is an invaluable buffer zone between western europe and russia . 
  this was a main disadvantage during the cold war . 
  same happened in germany , they booked a public space under the guise of a `` women 's theatre performance '' and then it turned out to be a turkish minister holding a rally , i wonder that if that disguise had some significance . 
  well that also means those 50bn in pension spending for uk citizens and half finished investment projects in britain are null and void , so either the uk could stop behaving like a child and find an arrangement or they will have to pick up the scraps anyways . 
  we 're talking about contributions to uk citizens , if anything it would be may leaving her own citizens behind just because she wo n't agree to a deal that makes her look weak . 
   schulz has the advantage of not being sigmar `` das pack '' gabriel ( i.e. 
  someone who has yet to alienate the core constituence of the spd ) wat, 
  why do you think a german newspaper has to be unbiased on us politics ? 
  pretty much the entire population is far left of the democratic party , and pretty much all agree that trump is an idiot and bad for germany . 
  nobody would be calling for unbiased reporting of iranian or north korean politics . 
  ah yes , the good old self reported trade tariffs . 
  which has nothing to do with mutual agreements . 
  trump has basically just thrown out every international agreement of the last few years . 
  paris accords on climate change ? 
  gone . 
  peace deal with iran ? 
  trump wants to cancel it . 
  sanctions on russia ?
