  monsanto does n't have more than 35 % market share in any given market . 
  are you calling that a monopoly ? 
  and i really doubt that you work in the industry , from your post history you seem to be quite occupied buying drugs on the darknet and pondering why you have to pay taxes . 
  and these are which ? 
  the green party in germany tried to implement a law that would create a `` veggie day '' on which no meat is allowed to be served in cantines that are open to the public . 
  and yes they strongly believe in all sorts of alternative medicine and want them to be treated like regular medicine . 
  so you want to ban an entire technology because you have a problem with patent law ? 
  oh and you know that non-gmo seeds are licensed and patented in the same way right ? 
  in which schmeiser was rightfully convicted of fraud , i do n't see the problem . 
  because train rides do n't cost money ? 
  i do n't get what her `` thesis '' is about . 
   so far , her experience contradicts studies that have recently claimed that `` long commutes are killing you . '', 
  what studies are these ? 
  being on the train for a long time literally kills you , huh ? 
  i strongly suspect these studies were about increased stress for people who have long rides to work or something like that . 
   the flat-rate ticket costs her about $ 380 , whereas she had to pay about $ 450 for her previous apartment . 
  however , living cheaper is not the only goal she has in mind . 
  well the fact that she still sleeps at relatives kinda negates that fact does n't it ? 
  and even if she really slept on the train you can easily get a smaller apartment for less than $ 380 . 
  i wonder why she had to leave her previous place . 
   others , however , have reacted more negatively : they feel offended by the fact that i question the ordinary way of life and living . '', 
  i believe they just think you 're stupid and do this for attention instead of seriously proposing an alternative lifestyle , that 's all . 
   her final undergraduate paper will be based on her experiences as a modern train-nomad . 
  and what insight should we be able to get from that ? 
  some do , there are also ~ ~ places like the us ~ ~ that do n't have such a rule but it has become tradition to only serve 2 terms . 
  i think we germans favour stability over anything else and that 's what her entire mandate has been , stability . 
  she is sufficiently competent and well-know in and outside the country . 
  among other world leaders she is respected and with some exceptions very popular . 
  now combine that with the fact that there is no other obvious choice with the same level of competency and you know why she will serve a fourth mandate . 
  if we had a subreddit called / r/europeandrama this would would be the time to get popcorn . 
  no , he always says that there ca n't be a transfer union without a political and fiscal union , varoufakis just happens to forget to mention that transfer part . 
  basically if you want the ez to pay your debts we wo n't do this without you giving up some control over you fiscal and political policies . 
  sch\u00e4uble thinks the current system with neverending negotiations about bail outs is unsustainable . 
  he wants to implement formal rules that go into effect when you apply for bail outs so that we wo n't have to argue over this all the time .

  http://www.imaginate.uk.com/mcc01_survey/site%20download.pdf http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/sharialaworonelawforall.pdf compiled by / u/goobiesnax so you think that 's all fine and dandy and if we just stop antagonizing them islam would be the `` religion of peace '' they 're so eager to talk about ? 
  and how do you think would we have gotten so far if we had written off that debt two years ago ? 
  even now greece could vote in a new party at any point and cancel all the reform programs . 
  we need that debt to get any change done . 
  no transfer union without a political union and that would results in the exact same measures that are being put in place now . 
  so de facto that 's what 's already happening , where is the problem ? 
  we need the debt to enforce those political demands , if we just write it off it would be a transfer union without any political control which is bound to fail and exactly the reason why the uk will not participate in any of this . 
  / r/europe already loves you and i 'm sure the rest of the world will catch on at some point , 
  it does n't help when the majority of the population of those 3rd world countries have ideologies that are reprehensible anywhere else . 
  especially with islam there needs to be a major reform movement until we can even try to make any developments in that area . 
  there are some who want to change the face of islam but their voices are too few and too quiet to account for anything . 
  it took us the bloody dark ages to step away from the most fundamental ideas about religion so i would n't bet on major changes any time soon . 
  this is not a mistake of the euro or the eurozone it 's the mistake of the failed financial policies of one member state . 
  yes we would likely take a larger hit than the uk if greece defaults , because we 're in the euro but should that be the only reason why we 're helping greece ? 
  to prevent our own markets from dipping ? 
  i do n't get that when i read the papers . 
  they 're all talking about solidarity and the european project . 
  is n't the uk part of that european project as well ? 
  why does nobody ask them for solidarity ? 
  are n't they part of the eu ? 
  through the euro we basically committed to helping each other so that 's what we do now . 
  we bound our destiny to that of 18 other member states . 
  does that mean you guys are exempt from any blame because you said from the start that you would n't help anyone out ? 
  at least we try and we will pay a major price helping greece , you do nothing . 
  so you agree that it would be stupid to pump another $ 85bn into a failed state ? 
  if greece wants to default on their debt ( and from my perspective a debt relief is nothing but a default ) they can honestly do so . 
  the greek people said oxi and i respect their wish , and i would happily write off that money if that means we will no longer commit to any further bail out programs . 
  campaign for it . 
  you could easily forgive the uk debt through the imf , such a meager amount anyways , should n't matter right ? 
  then why is the imf a thing , anyways ? 
  if it 's our problem then why does the imf make demands what we should or should n't do ? 
  why should i pay for greek failures but other eu or un countries should n't take that hit ? 
  well where 's their solidarity ? 
  the uk could easily say they forgive some of the greece debt as well . 
  explain me how does it work then ? 
  so you think that cost just disappears somehow ? 
  of course we will have to pay for it . 
  either through taxes or reduced benefits or that one school that could n't be built or something else . 
  or indeed we could have used that money for some actual humanitarian crisis . 
  that would be way more helpful than paying for greek pensions , military and state workers of the last 20 years . 
  where can i sign up for that ?
