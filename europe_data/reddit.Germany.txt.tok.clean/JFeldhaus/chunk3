  well then do n't come here and tell us all how you would be so generous and forgive debt . 
  your country is not helping in any way so frankly i do n't care what you would do or not . 
  the efsf and bilateral bailouts are directly backed by our tax money . 
  a total debt relief would directly result in a $ 80bn deficit for the german budget . 
  yeah but total debt relief would mean i have to pay an additional $ 2,500 in taxes or lost benefits over the next years . 
   i said that i might forgive debt . 
  well as the others pointed out , that 's an easy thing to say when you do n't have a couple thousand euro on the line . 
  you said you would n't help because you just do n't have that money laying around , well neither do i. 
  you may not have the money right now but maybe you could send 50 eur each month for the next 5 years to greece , that 's about the situation i 'm in right now , would you do that ? 
  why is this so hard to understand ? 
  if you say we should forgive greek debt then we would have to pay for that . 
  you are asking every ez taxpayer to give up a couple thousand euros . 
   if the greek government owed me any money , sure . 
  on average the greeks owe every german taxpayer $ 2,500 . 
  if we would forgive that debt we would have to pay for that through increased taxes , reduced benefits ect . 
  actually with the new package the total will be about $ 100bn ( $ 105,000,000,000 ) , round about $ 2,500 per tax payer . 
  that 's enough to pay for 25,000 average-sized schools for example . 
  or 100,000 libraries . 
  we could also pay pensions for more than a year or finance our aid program for students and trainees ( baf\u00f6g ) for over 30 years . 
  we could also provide housing and basic needs to every syrian refugee in the world for 5 year . 
  but i 'm sure the uk would be much more generous with their tax money . 
  well yes , i lack a couple thousand to throwaway too , but you say i should pay for a debt relief with my tax money ? 
  well the people outside of the ez ( all participants in the imf ) wo n't have to forgive any debt because the imf has stated that it wo n't forgive any debt . 
  would n't it be equally fair if the ez members said they wo n't support another bailout until the imf includes their own debt relief ? 
  and germany 125 times that . . 
  so before the summit you have negative probabilities to find an agreement ? 
  used the root to get rid of that . 
  p ( a ) = \u221a ( 1 - e ^ - t ) ? 
  and germany has already contributed about $ 85,000,000,000 ( eighty-five billion euro ) to the previous bailouts . 
  the third package would add about $ 20,000,000,000 ( twenty billion euro ) on top of that . 
  there are about 42 million tax payers in germany , so if we just equally distribute the cost that 's about $ 2,500 every tax payer will have to pay to make up for that . 
  i like to remind our british and american friends of this when they 're always so eager to demand bail out money for greece . 
  would you personally pay $ 2,500 to save greece ? 
  i mean you 're always welcome to participate . 
  i could have certainly used that money , that 's more than i make in a month , but let 's not focus on that . 
  you know what else we could have done with that money ? 
  build about 25,000 average-sized schools for example . 
  or 100,000 libraries . 
  we could also pay pensions for more than a year or finance our aid program for students and trainees for over 30 years . 
  we could also provide housing and basic needs to every syrian refugee in the world for 5 years , but i 'm sure the greeks need it more . 
  and that 's exactly why greece should n't have been stalling negotiations since january . 
  we 've been saying this for months but nobody seems to listen . 
  the reforms have to be passed asap . 
  the banks are running out of money tomorrow , the next repayment is coming up in a few days , how much time do you think they have ? 
  as we like to say : now you 've got the salad . 
  maybe with some sort of transitional agreement ? 
  they could be incorporated into romania but full membership of the eu and the romanian state would be rolled out over the next 10 years or so . 
  meanwhile they could receive developmental aid from the eu and the local government gets incorporated and restructured step by step by the romanian state advised by the eu . 
  so if someone burned down the statue of liberty that would be awesome because it 's `` impressive and bizarre '' ? 
  but remember that not just the leaders have to agree to the bailout package but also the parliaments . 
  does n't matter if the current pm votes in favor if they ca n't get it through parliament . 
  could even be a problem for hollande who has been very supportive but there are a lot of euroskeptics in his parliament . 
  any reform that results in a balanced budget really . 
  personally i do n't care about the specifics of the reforms but rather the result . 
  the problem is that greece has n't proposed any reform plan that achieves this goal with the existing revenue . 
  syriza hopes that they can maintain the current spending ( or cut it as little as possible ) and then somehow generate a lot more revenue through the economy to balance their budget in 10 years or so . 
  until that happens the eurozone would have to pay for the greek deficit . 
  even before the crisis when the greece economy was pretty strong they ran on a massive deficit so why should we believe that they can somehow generate even more revenue than before the crisis in this situation ? 
  they 're basically asking us to pump even more money into their spending programs and hope for an economic boom . 
  most of the rest of the eurozone thinks they wo n't achieve this , that there is a structural problem with the greece budget and that they will never balance it until they make severe cuts . 
  we also think that the entire system has to be devalued significantly to become attractive for businesses again , meaning lower wages , no early retirement ect . 
  some more information on the haircut because somehow it 's hard to find good sources on this :  part of that deal was a psi agreement , whereby private investors were asked to accept to write off ** 53.5 % of the face value ** of greek governmental bonds they 're holding , the equivalent to an ** overall loss of around 75 % ** .

  nope . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nqijait.jpg ) is the uncropped version . 
  [ source from the guardian  ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/jul/07/greek-debt-crisis-alex-tsipras-seeks-last-chance-deal-live#block-559be518e4b00bdd27708508 )  euclid tsakalotos appears to have committed a schoolboy error at his first eurogroup meeting , by allowing his notes ( written on hotel paper ! ), 
  to be photographed . 
  it includes a reminder to avoid any `` triumphalism '' ( presumably following sunday 's referendum ) anyone able to decipher what it all says ? 
  i can only make out some words . 
  the only upside of that is that the greek people really do n't want to allign themselves with russia and tsirpas might get punished from the electorate if he pushes too far with the russia threat . 
  yeah let 's not fix their terrible deficit but instead just send them even more free money i 'm sure that will work out . 
  if you read the article , they 're not saying this . 
  they 're saying if we do n't find an agreement by today , the banks will have to stay closed because ela was n't extended , in fact it ca n't be extended without an agreement . 
  i think it 's stupid to hold a referendum on financial matters . 
  if we were to ask the public everytime we wanted to increase some tax , they would say `` no '' in nearly all cases . 
  if we ask them whether benefits should be increased , the answer would almost certainly be `` yes '' . 
  does nobody realize how that is a stupid idea ? 
  jetzt mal die fakten auf den tisch : wikipedia fasst es [ hier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private_sector_involvement#cite_note-group-4 ) gut zusammen :  part of that deal was a psi agreement , whereby private investors were asked to accept to write off ** 53.5 % ** of the ** face value ** of greek governmental bonds they 're holding , the ** equivalent to an overall loss of around 75 % ** . 
  die quelle f\u00fcr diese 53,5 % is [ dieses ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/128075.pdf ) statement der eurogroup . 
  [ hier ] ( http://www.mirandaxafa.com/mediaupload/articles/life_after_debt.pdf ) sehr ausf\u00fchrlich erkl\u00e4rt :  overall , the psi extinguished ** $ 106 billion ** of debt ( 54 % of gdp ) 106 milliarden euro schuldenschnitt durch private investoren , also ** genau das was ich gesagt habe ** und ** genau das was du forderst ** aber meinst es w\u00e4re nie passiert . 
  yeah remember that time when we stepped away from the negotiations about the marshall plan and said the us is terrorising us with their demands and restructuring programs ? 
  oh right we were n't even invited . 
  yes but couple it to a tax increase to pay for that , so that every knows exactly what 's at stake here - their own money . 
  actually i think cameron would quite like that . 
  britain is very much against any bailouts and if greece is leaving there is no imminent threat of that any time soon . 
  well the nordic countries are pretty much against any further bailouts so no help there !, 
  well there was that thing about being accused of terrorism and tons of other shit before , so i think it 's somehow justified . 
  well it 's only reasonable to postpone the review process and wait for election results . 
  you ca n't give recommendations if everything might change next month . 
  well the aid stopped because syriza announced they would n't go through with the agreed on reform plans . 
  at least we tried . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-05/no-victory-appears-probable-what-happens-next-according-deutsche-bank ) is an overview of what could happen next . 
  i think the source is fine . 
  he clearly explains every possibility , you could argue about the probabilities he assigns but that 's not the point . 
  * greek i would change that , `` reek people '' sounds kind of offensive . 
  syriza ( the governing party ) and many people inside greece think that a no vote would force the other eu member states to offer better terms and that they could keep the euro no matter what . 
  all other member states have already said that a no vote would mean no agreement and greece would be forced to abandon the euro and devaluate their new currency . 
  syriza and supporters are basically gambling at very high stakes and everyone outside of greece knows they will fail if they vote no but somehow they do n't get this inside of greece .
