  of course maybe they just secretly want their state to go bankrupt . 
  psshhhht , 
  all greek people should vote `` nai '' ( no ) !, 
  you 've got that all wrong , there are no asylants from greece , they are part of the eu , they do n't have to seek asylum and that would n't be granted anyways . 
  if you have such strong opinions on asylum seekers but you do n't even know where they are from you should revalue your position . 
  i would like to acknowledge that despite what the media sometimes portraits we do have a large and beloved greek community in germany and we welcome anyone who tries to look for work over here . 
  there wo n't be any further negotiations , there wo n't be any better terms , please for once realize the facts . 
  it has been said many times , this is the final offer , either greece accepts or it wo n't receive any more assistance . 
  the time has run out , technically even that final offer is n't on the table any more . 
  well the ecb is bound by law to only provide assistance to solvent banks , you could say draghi was being political in that the greek banks have been technically insolvent for a long time but at least until now he could say that they were backed by the troika . 
  i do n't think there is any chance he could argue in favor of assistance in case of a no vote . 
  in that case further assistance would be a blatant breach of european law and i do n't think even draghi could get away with that . 
  legal does n't mean possible . 
  the only possibility for greece to keep the euro with a no vote would be if the ez suddenly caved in and offered a new deal that favors tsirpa 's position which they already said they wo n't . 
  even then it is questionable if the ecb would start giving greece money again because from a legal standpoint that 's very sketchy because the ecb can only provide assistance to solvent banks . 
   if you say it repeatedly right after a referendum on the exact topic has been announced , yes . 
  of course it is a `` fear-inducing comment '' in order to sway voters in a certain direction . 
  so if there is a referendum on whether you should shoot yourself in the head i should not try to warn you about the consequences ? 
   so shauble and tusk are lying too ? 
  they also said that a no would n't mean leaving the ez , in fact there 's going to be negotiations whether it 's a yes or no and all kinds of things can happen . 
  whether you are technically leaving the ez or just stop using euro is a different question , the fact is greece would have to stop using the euro because it just does n't have any left . 
  if you do n't have any euros left you ca n't use them to pay pensions ect . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  none of this actually answers the question how you plan on keeping the euro without money from the ecb . 
  well i do n't have a problem with that as long as he follows the acts on behalf of the greek citizens , signs the agreement and puts the reforms in place . 
  nope . 
  [ ** how high are interest rates now ? 
  ** ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/an-interest-rate-cut-will-do-little-to-solve-greek-budget-trouble-a-923281.html ) ( spiegel )  in terms of interest rate levels , the differences between the two bailout packages are significant . 
  the interest rate on the ** bilateral loans ** are based on the three-month rate of the euribor benchmark rate , which is currently at a level of around ** 0.2 percent ** . 
  in addition , greece was charged an initial premium of 3 percent . 
  despite this already low premium , the euro-zone states repeatedly eased the conditions and it is now only at 0.5 percent . 
  so currently , ** greece is paying interest of about 0.7 percent ** . 
   conditions imposed by the ** efsf ** apply to the second bailout package . 
  the backstop fund and its permanent successor , the european stability mechanism ( esm ) , do not disclose the exact interest rates applied to the loans they grant . 
  according to information obtained by spiegel online , the rate for greece , as well as ireland and portugal , is currently ** under 2 percent ** . 
   at the moment , however , the interest rate does n't really mean anything for greece , anyway . 
  at the end of 2010 , a further easing of its burden was agreed to , and ** interest on the second aid package has been deferred for 10 years ** . 
  a so-called guarantee fee of 0.1 percent that other euro bailout recipients are still being forced to pay was also reduced to zero . 
  [ ** greece 's debt pile : is it really unsustainable ? 
  ** ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6e5532c0-a310-11e4-ac1c-00144feab7de.html#axzz3ewgnd9ea ) ( ft.com )  the terms on greece 's debt pile have become progressively more manageable . 
  the maturity on the bilateral loans provided by eurozone member states in may 2010 has been extended to 2041 and the ** interest rate cut from between 300 and 400 basis points over the three-month euribor rate , to just 50 . 
  **  the efsf loans , whose yield is just one basis point over the average borrowing cost of the efsf itself , now have an average maturity of more than 30 years . 
  ** in 2012 , the eurozone finance ministers agreed on a grace period of 10 years over which athens will have to make no principal repayment ** . 
   as a result of these changes , the average maturity of greece 's debt is now 16.5 years , double that of germany and italy , according to data compiled by joakim tiberg , a strategist at ubs . 
  portugal and ireland , which also benefit from favourable terms for their own bailout loans , have average maturities of 11 and 12.5 years , respectively . 
   furthermore , the amount greece pays each year to service its debts has steadily come down . 
  zsolt darvas , a research fellow at bruegel , a think-tank , has calculated that greece 's nominal interest spending in 2014 was 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product , less than italy or portugal . 
   in fact , this is probably an overestimate of the real interest burden . 
  greece did not have to pay any interest on its efsf loans and received back the yield it pays to the european central bank and other national central banks , which hold just under one-tenth of its debt . 
  taking this into account , mr darvas calculates that ** total interest expenditure in 2014 was 2.6 per cent ** , only marginally above france 's 2.2 per cent . 
  yes it 's legal but it does n't make any sense . 
  you ca n't use a currency that you do n't physically have any more notes of . 
  it 's just a fact . 
  if i tell you , you are probably going to die if you shoot yourself in the head , is that a ` threat ' or a ` fear-inducing comment ' , too ? 
  and why have the european leaders been repeating this fact the entire week ? 
  because tsirpas and varoufakis have gone on television to lie to their citizens saying they could decline the agreement and keep the euro . 
  the greece citizens should know the truth about what they 're up to if they vote no . 
  sure they would still be allowed to use the euro but as we know the banks would run out of euros in about 2 days . 
  what happens then ? 
  at this point the government just has to print their own currency to keep the system alive , it 's not a matter of choice really . 
  greece was offered way more than any european partner ever has and still refused to be helped , i do n't get your point . 
  refusing to gift someone money is inhuman now ? 
  90 % of that money went to the creditors because greece borrowed that money from the creditors before and spent it . 
  does really nobody understand this ? 
  minus the interest ( which is basically 0 % at this point ) all the money went to the greece people , to pensions , to state workers , to the military and all the other stuff greece has spent ridiculous amounts of money on . 
  ahh the old `` they only helped the banks !! 1 !, 
  '' - card , one of the most annoying yet persistent talking points , which makes me wonder if everyone lacks the basic principles of logic . 
  yes the main portion of the ez loans was used to pay off old debt , but does really nobody realize that greece was borrowing money in the first place which then resulted in this very same old debt ? 
  where did those loans go ? 
  to the greece people of course , to pensions , to state workers and to the military . 
  besides the usual interest no banks profitted at all from these aids , that 's how banks work , in fact they agreed to a huge 50 % haircut when the crisis started . 
  syriza claim that they could keep using the euro even without an agreement which is just wrong . 
  i just hope in the case of a `` yes '' vote , tsirpas has an ounce of decency left and he signs the agreement before resigning , waiting for a reelection could take forever and by then it may have been to late for the greece people . 
  ok , how do you plan on keeping the euro when you run out of money then ? 
  without an agreement with the ez greece ca n't keep using the euro as they will have no money to do so , that 's just a fact , not a threat . 
  that 's not a threat it 's just fact . 
  greece itself ca n't keep using the euro without funding from ez and ecb . 
  uhm , no ? 
  varoufakis said he would resign if greece voted yes . 
  he literally said he would rather cut his arm off than sign that deal . 
   when you have people from all over the place spouting nonsense such as `` a no vote means grexit '' then you really begin to become frustrated and question their motives . 
  greece can not legally be removed from the eu/eurozone . 
  i 'm sorry but despite what syriza wants you to believe that 's just the reality . 
  nobody is pushing you out of the ez but you would just have to go on your own to stay alive . 
  how do you plan on keeping the euro when both the troika and the ecb stop sending you money ? 
  i do n't think you have understood the severity of the situation yet . 
  yeah i 'm sure you are the smart one who get all this , who can see behind the curtain . 
  it must have been those evil banks right ? 
  because everyone tells you the banks are evil so it must be true . 
  it was their little evil masterplan all along to lend money to greece and then lose $ 100bn when the crisis started , what a sinister plan !, 
  and greece would have been bankrupt . 
  how would that help to improve greece 's deficit ? 
  it would only delay the problem . 
  nobody is expecting that greece will ever be able to pay back it 's debt and it 's already zero interest and most of the repayments have been pushed back for years . 
  but with the debt in place , the eu at least has some leverage to make greece balance their budget and pass structural reforms that are inevitable for the country to survive . 
  why would the previous program automatically extend ? 
  that 's just stupid and illogical , all the debt that greece has accumulated was spent by greece on the greece people , military , infrastructure and so on , minus the normal interest rates but plus the 100bn in debt that was already forgiven by the banks . 
  yes greece spent all that money , the banks did n't recieve anything besides 50 % of the money which they lended to greece . 
  that 's about 450bn euro greece did n't have but nevertheless spent . 
   greece took only 10 % of the bailout funds .
