  [ the last supper - finland edition . 
  this is great !, 
  we should have a european `` hug a neighbor state '' day !, 
  norway is included so that 's a bit strange huh . . edit : so as far as i understand it , in 2010 when the `` european union climate and energy package '' that sets these goals was created , norway decided to participate while switzerland decided to do a similar program on their own , that may be the reason why you guys are not included in this graph . 
  nope , it 's the french in this case , i believe it 's part of the state of emergency after the paris shootings . 
  he 's moving on thin ice there , diplomatic immunities are given out to ensure they may effectively carry out their duties , the home country can revoke that immunity and in the case of drunk driving this has happened before but only after they caused some sort of accident . 
  see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomatic_immunity#drunk_driving_and_vehicular_assault ) for 2 examples . 
  the creation of this centre does n't mean abusers wo n't be punished anymore , but there are many non illegal ways to create a hostile atmosphere against homosexuals , that 's why this centre is important . 
  it 's the same here and would be the same in case of abuse of a gay person . 
  are you somehow under the assumption that the creation of this centre somehow stops criminals from being persecuted because they just relocate the victim ? 
  that 's wrong . 
  the centre just provides extra protection for people who feel like they 're under threat . 
  and the gay refugee centre is a place for people who do n't feel safe in their current environment . 
  i do n't get what the point is ? 
  forcing people in different camps according to their sexuality would be discrimination , offering a more secure environment for gays is not . 
   your comment just openly admits german authorities have lost control in parts of their country lolwut ? 
  this is a harmless banter post . 
   how many of them had submissions like this one ? 
  ca n't think of any . 
  really ? 
  there are no negative submission against germany on here ? 
  are you joking ? 
  and then the saudis claim they are n't their problem either . 
  it 's always easy to shift the burden to someone else , that 's why we as a union propose a system that allows a fair allocation of refugees across our members states . 
  are you really telling me that if germany can deal with 1,000,000 refugees without any significant problem , your state is so weak that it ca n't even deal with 5,000 ? 
  budgeting is part of that basic self-determination right ? 
  so we could have a referendum stopping all developmental aid to the eu but still remain in the union right ? 
  if you just join for the benefits and none of the responsibilities , this is n't a union anymore . 
  why did they join the eu then ? 
  if you just join for the benefits and none of the responsibilities , this is n't a union anymore . 
  `` i do n't like you so let others deal with it ! '', 
  that 's the european spirit !, 
  for all smartasses and `` told you so ! '', 
  people that inevitably show up in these threads : no this is not a new policy , no we 're not budging from our previous position . 
  unlike iraq and syria , afghanistan is not considered a universally unsafe territory , only people from certain regions get considered for asylum status which works out to roughly 50 % of arrivals ( see the statistics for last year [ here ] ( http://www.asylumineurope.org/sites/default/files/stats1_1.png ) ) . 
  as for those who get rejected , it had previously been a problem to send them back which has now been solved so the process to deport them is starting . 
  considering that croatians are one of the largest ethnic groups in germany today , you guys really seemed to like our immigration policy back in the 90s . 
  strange how now you 're the one opposing it huh ?

  i just love how / r/europe spins every story about merkel lately . 
  the title is highly misleading , you have to be familiar with the context and look at the exact wording . 
  she wants to ` drastically reduce refugee arrivals ' in germany . 
  she does n't want to limit asylum , she wants to combat the underlying issues and thus reduce the need for asylum . 
  this was the whole point about the compromise she struck with some of her party members . 
  so no , we 're not closing the borders like everyone here seems to be suggesting , refugees are still just as welcome as they were before . 
  we just want to actually do something about the reason these guys have to seek refuge .
