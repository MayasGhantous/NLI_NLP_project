   funny thing is that many canadians think the same ( that we europeans want to harm them with bad european products ) . 
  both sides have people who are convinced of the other side 's malintent . 
  the gist of it is that both sides believe to be harmed by corporate interests and global finance ( a world most people do n't understand and fear ) , less by europeans or canadians respectively . 
  with ttip it might be a bit different , the us is seen as the national personification of capitalism and business so anti-americanism is more prevalent among opponents . 
  it is a lame reference , 
  see , it is difficult for me to help you then as i am not familiar with estonian law . 
  but for me it seems like your best shot is suing asap , the way the lawyer suggested it . 
  and i am in no position to tell you what to do , but i feel going public would help you a lot . 
  public support can go a long way and often makes insurances settle outside of court in order to avoid a precedent ruling . 
  sorry for this . 
  the first thing i 'd have suggested is legal aid , but you already have a lawyer . 
  what does he suggest ? 
  he is not doing his job properly if he 's just telling you what he ca n't do . 
  maybe you should seek out a second opinion . 
  there must be some ngo offering legal counsel , try that . 
  apart from that : if it is really as grim as you say , and if you have tried all `` normal '' ways of getting help - go public . 
  public pressure is all that could change insurances / politicians stances on what seems to be essentially a political issue . 
  if migrating is a viable possibility , consider that as well . 
  our interior intelligence agency has been partly discredited and accused of favouring right wing extremists . 
  also , like everything in germany it is hit by federalism , so we have 16 state offices in our l\u00e4nder and one for the whole country [ in cologne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_office_for_the_protection_of_the_constitution ) . 
  then there is our foreign intelligence agency , the [ bnd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_intelligence_service_\\ ( germany \\ ) ) which seems to be doing good work , though we do n't know a lot about it . 
  just that it cooperates with the cia , nsa and other eu agencies a lot . 
  how does your user name it into the equation then ? 
  you could actually say both * nachicht * and * naricht * and people would n't notice in a casual conversation . 
  the [ sack of magdeburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sack_of_magdeburg ) maybe ? 
  the thirty years war in general . 
  yes , with certain dishes at least . 
  i would never peel baked potatoes for example . 
  but with roasted or cooked potatoes we peel them . 
  we would have totally succeeded , just could n't be bothered to try . 
  you can trust me on this . 
  we tried to invade britain ? 
  i do n't know man , just making an observation . 
  but the defeat of the spanish armada was obviously far earlier than the napoleonic era so if you 're telling me stuff i do n't know about the spanish role at trafalgar i am inclined to believe you . 
  now i remember . 
  it 'd be interesting to know whether everyone 's favorite gauls are popular in the us as well . 
  fair enough . 
  though the spanish armada was much larger . 
  i think these protests need time and motivation but not really large sums of money ... maybe donate to a project that needs it ? 
  in any case , your intentions are admirable . 
  the only answer possible . 
  have they even been to greece actually ? 
  his victory kept britain in the war and eventually able to support the liberation movements in germany and spain to beat back france after napoleons invasion of russia . 
  it also enabled the brits to steal other countries colonies . 
  the spanish navy on its own did n't succeed in beating england either : /, 
  thanks for explaining the situation !, 
  now i especially like the faroese one . 
  gr\u00f6nland , faroer and denmark ? 
  so there is a danish anthem other than the royal one ? 
  hamburg has a [ semi-official anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uciktue8uf4 ) ( used for official events ) . 
  [ a more pompous version with choir ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wpn0vudszu ) . 
  other popular songs : [ hamborger veermaster ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur0nekh0nrg ) , a shanty partly in english , partly in low german created during the californian gold rush . 
  a classic composed in 1912 refering to the infamous night life on the reeperbahn in st. pauli . 
  here sung by hans albers in the musical gro\u00dfe freiheit nr . 
  7 ( great freedom no . 
  7 ) from 1943/44 ( goebbels did n't like it and banned it ) . 
  [ in hamburg sagt man tsch\u00fcss ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqzpmldqpcm ) . 
  sung by heidi kabel . 
  another classic even if we 'd call it kitsch today, 
  it transformed national pride into being healthier , less aggressive . 
  the debate is especially silly because pre-1945 austrian and german were no antitheses . 
  to an extent , but we have new competitors with china , japan and a modernised russia today . 
  have n't you read the statement in brackets ? 
  are we classifying parties according to whether they are `` pro- '' or `` anti-muslim '' now ? 
  dear lord . 
  you people tell me . 
  that is an admirable attitude . 
  why did he return ? 
  there were no large scale political shifts in germany around that time . 
  of course , in your ancestors life there might have been very large ones , but about those no one here can tell you . 
  if he had went to the us it might have had to do with the american revolutionary war , but he did n't ... 
  they are published weekly though . 
  but both are good , i grant that . 
  s\u00fcddeutsche and faz are both good , but slightly left - and slightly right-leaning respectively . 
  funny , since jan hus was a czech . 
  simple , honest people , but a bit blunt . 
  rough on the edges . 
  our eastern neighbour . 
  polish food is very tasty , but not refined like french or italian cuisine , so pretty much like in germany . 
  crazy language when it is written . 
  when spoken , it can sound really appealing . 
  the poles i have met these last months have all been from the rural south east though , maybe that shapes my perception . 
  the french are n't the only ones : https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/erlebnis_burgbau_friesach, 
  well , then he probably should n't have formulated them like he did . 
  i find the way they are put troubling , your interpretations however not . 
  `` you 're not to think you are anything special '' - this fundamentally denies human individualism . 
  no person is 100 % like another , therefore everyone is special . 
  being special is not good or bad , it is just the way humans are . 
  `` you 're not to think you can teach us anything . '', 
  - why not ? 
  sometimes you know more about a certain topic than others . 
  teaching is good , it means you can help others understand the world better . 
  you 'd also want others to help you . 
  `` you 're not to think anyone cares about you . '', 
  - this is downright awful and creepy . 
  if any society actually followed all these rules , i can only imagine of what miserable wretches it would be made up . 
  thankfully neither denmark nor other scandinavian countries follow them . 
  i do n't like spoiled brats either ; but neither do i long for a return to 19th century morals in education . 
  let us aim for the middle ground . 
  some of it is sensible , some parts are legitimately creepy .
