  also , i do n't want the state to have the power to kill its citizens . 
  honestly , to me it 's the belief some weirdos have that we are all still nazis or at least authoritarian in closet . 
  like i 've experienced it a few times that ( alcoholised ) people would n't believe me we were n't still somehow proud of the third reich and/or the german empire . 
  they were so cool and all !, 
  what especially gets me is that it is always implied our democratic federal republic is inferior and not the `` true '' germany they believe to know from movies and the assumption that i just ca n't wait to jump into my hugo boss suit and invade poland under a swastika banner . 
  you mean the r/europe brigade ? 
  or that even [ verdi ] ( https://youtu.be/ssxxb6ze0lm?t=14 ) can sound passable in german . 
  though the italian original probably is still up there . 
  we would be if the roman empire came back . 
  wait , i would n't . 
  9 a.d. best year of my life !, 
  right , it 's probably as soft as german gets . 
  i do n't know , it depends on how it 's recited i think . 
  to me [ fr\u00fchling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96yyd8dupho ) sounds relatively soft spoken . 
  i have a soft spot for welsh and gaelic . 
  you hardly hear celtic languages at all . 
   but overall we feel good about him . 
  if we know about him ... as for friedrich der gro\u00dfe ( frederick the great ) he is a controversial figure , absolutely reviled in e.g. 
  poland and criticised for beginning wars an putting his people in misery because of it . 
  but at the same time he really was the definition of an enlightened monarch who reformed and changed lots of things for the better , there are countless of adages and tales of him helping someone , making a quip or a comment on the prussian elite for example . 
  and there 's his character , it 's just intriguing in a way - he was an artist , an intellectual , but also a glory hound , a great general and he could be both kind and ruthless . 
  and there 's of course his troubled childhood . 
  i would use `` eh '' in your first two examples , the last one sounds really weird . 
  though i could imagine saying `` ja , g ** eh ** t klar '', 
  so what 's your question ? 
  4 of 7 british comments naming ruth davidson . 
  i guess i 'll have to read up on her . 
  i could see [ peter tauber ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_tauber ) following merkel in the office . 
  maybe not immediately afterwards . 
  is it true you say `` pr\u00f6stli '' ? 
  oh i meant it in a friendly way , as in you convinced me . 
  though we have the words `` h\u00fclle '' and `` sch\u00fcssel '' too . 
  got me there , i have to admit . 
  the extra syllable is a bit weird though . 
  by the way , is n't it weird for you too ? 
  you know , saying `` bowl '' , even though you 're drinking from glasses or bottles ? 
  `` schol '' is from scandinavian , right ? 
  how did it come to belgium ? 
  if we were to do the same thing , it would probably be `` schal '' . 
   if you dislike the sound of those grandma lovers ( schlager ) , you 'll have a hard time finding good cover versions of songs , i. e. versions that are not schlager music . 
  i can always recommend ** zupfgeigenhansel ** for that , a group of musicians with the stated goal to perform and collect folk music without drifting into * schlager * or * kitsch * territory . 
  just some examples of their work : [ es dunkelt schon in der heide ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4h-0shtlyy ) - on lovers having to part ways . 
  [ ein stolzes schiff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zets38fk8ly ) - on german emigration to america [ b\u00fcrgerlied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybxodbigjrc ) - song against feudal society and for democracy popular during the 1848 revolution and later in the worker 's movement . 
  then there are some nice recordings by hannes wader : [ bunt sind schon die w\u00e4lder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnzcthyiuoi ) - on autumn and the passing of time [ heute hier , morgen dort ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trzsd-dyi80 ) - a sort of modern folk song based on an american melody , on passing of time and a wanderer 's life . 
  liederjan is good too . 
  [ die weber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrlpzd25eey ) - rendition of heinrich heine 's poem on the plight of the silesian textile workers who rebelled in 1845 . 
  [ schnitter tod ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slcss1fvqb4 ) - an old text , dealing with death and destruction during the thirty years war using flowers as a metaphor . 
  till schweiger is our will smith . 
  somewhere deep down there 's a good actor hidden , but only for very specific roles . 
  * da da da-da di da * * du da du-da di da *, 
  it 's all the same ideology , just that germany 's modern history has given them a new angle to justify their crazy ideas . 
  were we still an empire they would probably have called it a company too . 
  they 're similar to sovereign citizens in the us though . 
  i 'd be interested to know how often it 's actually done though . 
  and the impact on climate change those flights have ... 
  nice one - we sang that one in school often . 
  first one sounds great !, 
  it is n't world war 2 anymore , when this was pretty much true . 
  could see that , yes . 
  or just tory . 
  going by the first ( and best ) actor , snp . 
  i mean the czechs are naming marbod - we can get arminius then , do n't you think ? 
  just based on feels , and relative to german standards - saxony-anhalt . 
  thuringia has some industry and good universities still . 
  mecklenburg has tourism and the baltic coast , brandenburg profits from berlin and saxony is comparatively populous with a strong economy and culture . 
  saxony-anhalt does n't have anything . 
  their wealth is a relatively recent development and down to political stability as well as banks and oil respectively . 
  norwegians left for the u.s. in masses during the 19th century and we even have a [ name and wiki article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/swabian_children ) for the swiss children sent to work in south west germany in order to avoid starvation . 
  czechs and bavarians supposedly love each other already ( though someone from the border region i know stated that there is little to no contact ) . 
  you know , it 's been raining here all day and i just did n't expect them to crawl out of their holes and wet their $ 450 leather scraps . 
  yes , in fact i 've just chased away ten fat orcs from the castle here in my neighbourhood . 
  they were huffing and puffing and i believe one of them asked me why i forgot my aragorn costume . 
  does n't change the fact that after this event catalan autonomy was removed and the language suppressed . 
  wine ( \u2714 ) saucisson ( \u2714 ) real bread ( ? ), 
  in germany almost everything is being dubbed too , and the results are n't bad at all . 
  what are you getting at ? 
  what are you getting at ? 
  putin 's wet dream . 
  yes , that 's correct . 
  i guess the coasts of pomerania and mecklenburg are meant . 
  so what 's it in danish ? 
  usually i can extrapolate the german word form that . 
  i was more surprised by bosnia and serbia to be honest . 
   schleswig and holstein  some of northern germany ? 
  [ france ] ( http://www.ef.de/epi/regions/europe/ ) , with italy and spain not far ahead . 
  the site explains this by the respective national languages being based on latin , which apparently makes it harder to master english . 
  well , me personally , i think europe is a geographic state . 
  i think it 's a side effect of them largely losing their importance . 
  of course not all are like that , there are now even mixed associations and those exclusively for women for example . 
  no , i am not . 
  as you stated , they have significantly decreased in importance during the last century . 
  it also has to do with the sad reality that some fraternities discredited themselves with their ultra-nationalism , antisemitism and opposition to the weimar republic . 
  i have to say though , sliding feet seems like a pretty interesting way to applaud , 
  i thought only austrians , swiss and a few americans did that . 
  now i have to ask : are you using the academic knock as well ? 
  then again , we sent a huge amount of lawyers to the east , for rebuilding the whole administration and judiciary . 
  i 've heard that 's one of the origins of west germans ' reputation for arrogance there . 
  you do that too ? 
  huh . 
  it was really bad .
