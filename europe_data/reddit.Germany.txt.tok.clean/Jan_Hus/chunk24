  but what then ? 
  without a deal like the one we have with turkey , i can guarantee you that they wo n't take them back . 
  quit complaining about the turkey deal if you have no alternative proposal . 
  exactly the attitude is the problem . 
  because it ignores that the wider problem ca n't simply be solved by turning a blind eye , that the perpetrators are not representative of the wider population - were mostly not even syrian and in europe before the migrant crisis - and that the majority do deserve help . 
  i agree with all your points , but i still think orban should have clarified who he meant . 
  well it is good to hear you do n't want that . 
  still , why are you conflating the many problems other european countries and citizens have regarding the state of polish democracy with the refugee crisis ? 
  it is something i often see from polish redditors . 
  and then there 's this weird conviction that germany is basically facing imminent destruction - and i 'm sorry , but it is hard not to notice the glee and satisfaction behind some of those comments . 
  and this is a bit off-topic , but i hear lots of complaining from poland over how germany apparently controls everything in europe - the most ridiculous thing if you 're living here and know a bit about what the majority of germans think on this - but then again poland is especially unwilling to assume a leading position . 
  it is a fact that we live in an age of increased migration - the causes being mainly poverty , persecution and war - and we need to find some way to cope with it , we need to find solutions and answers . 
  but most of what comes from poland and eastern europe ( and britain ) in general is just isolationism . 
  you exlusively think about yourself , but then complain when others get to lead the eu . 
  countries like italy and greece face the crisis directly and ca n't just ignore it , like eastern europe wants to . 
  the answer we eventually find does n't need to or even should be `` taking everyone in '' ( which of course never was germany 's policy either ) , but it needs to at least attempt to solve the problem . 
  we ca n't do it by ignoring it and hoping it goes away . 
  who did orban mean with `` migrants '' then ? 
  according to / u/metalmaniac9999 mena migrants . 
  i think he should have said that instead of attacking every person that has ever migrated to another country . 
  snide remarks on my education are n't helpful either . 
   and then the mass rape at 31st of december happend in germany and it was a perfect `` penalty '' for germany . 
  one of the most disgusting statements i read in a long time . 
  watching with glee as other people suffer . 
  migration is migration is migration . 
  if you only mean brown people by `` migrants '' , you can damn well say it . 
  this just has to be a bait comment . 
  please , let it be one . 
  how is this upvoted at all ? 
  yeah , what benefits do all those hard-working people bring to norway ? 
  the polish and lithuanian labourers keeping your oil industry running , the many doctors and nurses educated in west european countries providing you with medical care ... and you `` fail to see what benefit they bring once they do come '' ? 
  be glad the americans did n't have it when norwegians left their at that point poor , backwards country to migrate to the us in the 19th century . 
  use res or ignore , it was the same for greeks during their debt crisis and for germans in threads on the migrant crisis . 
  look , it is a bloody troll . 
  someone calling 300 + million people `` losers '' should not be given attention , in any case . 
  well , it would be given back to cyprus anyway , not greece . 
  that is not the choice they make , you know . 
  there are many , many more important reasons to live in the netherlands over turkey . 
  fair enough , i doubt that people with above-average paying jobs and high education consider this to be an essential reason for chosing their country of residence . 
  i 've just returned from one . 
  why would highly educated turks with good job prospects live on welfare ? 
  highly educated turks receive welfare in the netherlands ? 
  though i.e. 
  ankara or izmir were not founded by greeks , it is besides the point . 
  are you also claiming that berlin is slavic or mexico city aztec ? 
  ** bbc fucked up the translation ** : there are 21 people in the train , but only four have been wounded , three badly . 
   i think after 40 years turkey 's finally realized they are never getting the eu no matter what lengths they go do , yeah , what a load of crap . 
  if you fulfill the criteria , you can join . 
  all they had to do was fulfill those very criteria . 
  thanks !, 
  the head of house hannover as well :  ** he was photographed urinating on the turkish pavilion at the expo 2000 event in hanover ** , causing a diplomatic incident and a complaint from the turkish embassy accusing him of insulting the turkish people . 
  he successfully sued those who published ( bild-zeitung ) the photograph for invasion of privacy , obtaining an award of 9,900 euros , although the paper had previously published a photo of ernst august ** urinating outside a hospital in austria . 
  ** [ 21 ] [ dead link ]  in 2004 , he was ** convicted of aggravated assault and causing grievous bodily harm after supposedly beating a man with a knuckleduster . 
  ** [ 22 ] [ 23 ] he has demanded a retrial for the case on the basis of false evidence . 
  his lawyers have publicly stated that he has never owned a knuckle duster in his life nor held one in his hand . 
  how much influence does he have on public opinion ? 
  is he active in the media ? 
  defending france would not have required the institution of a dictatorship , so you 're operating under a false premise . 
  the jacobins and the montagnards especially were a pack of callous , delusionary tyrans and not a shred better than the ones they were replacing . 
  their swift failure was entirely deserved and france and europe were better off without them . 
  morally , it died then and there . 
  i think he just really , really wants to live in a society with great poverty , serfdom , risk of starvation and little to no rule of law . 
  but hey , i guess it is more \u201e manly `` , whatever that means . 
  exactly . 
  as we all know , even the peasants walked around in shining armour back then , not just a small elite warrior caste . 
   i bet if you asked nicely they would stop killing and raping young girls . 
  the alt right 's obsession with sexuality is astounding . 
  it is needed right now , because brexit means the eu trade agreements no longer apply to britain . 
  that does n't mean anything . 
  it is simply necessary . 
  it is too early to say really . 
  but currently it does n't seem like may will pursue globalism . 
  but your definition of the word might be entirely different from mine . 
   globalisation it is truly funny that trucidator is for brexit , apparently in order to promote globalisation - while most of those who voted to leave are * fundamentally * opposed to it . 
  he 's had family members and volunteers helping him over the years . 
  and he also went to an architect for consultation a couple of times . 
   if we can keep our language why would we stop you from speaking german ? 
  just like with the bmw plant in oxford , this is n't unexpected . 
  many companies have invested a great deal in britain , they are not going to just throw it away . 
  of course not . 
  ** however ** it will be interesting to see whether britain receives as much investment and attention in the future . 
  we might see a slow process of relocating production to the continent - slow , but steady . 
  investments that were planned before might be cancelled . 
  if a company was thinking about either intensifying production in arhus or in bristol , it is more likely to chose arhus now . 
   the giant conglomerate also warned that its plans to export wind turbine blades from a new facility in hull were being put on hold . 
    the # 310m manufacturing hub in the city will employ about 1,000 people . 
    the company has insisted this investment will continue and will be used to meet local demand , but mr kaeser said new trade barriers could make it uneconomical to export the blades to denmark and germany . 
  i understand your anger . 
  but from an eu viewpoint , the rules that are decided upon need to be enforced . 
  by the way , merely blaming the eu here is n't fair . 
  the european governments had the final say on whether portugal and spain should be fined . 
  if anything , this result shows that the eu is still a sort of club for national governments that make up rules and break them according to the interests of the most influential members . 
  we need either no eu at all , or we need a powerful eu that is able to kick france 's and germany 's butt if need be . 
  but then again , having an eu with such powers means giving up sovereignty which everyone hates , it seems . 
  you both make good points . 
  political and institutional efficiency and accountability is necessary , but at the same time not every country can be a tax haven , since their existence requires other countries to have higher taxes and more regulations . 
   now that uk is on its way out call me crazy , but i still doubt it will happen . 
  we have a unique situation in the uk right now , where the parliamentary majority is opposed to something they are expected to carry out . 
  i think it is more likely a new ge will be called at some point . 
   we 've engaged architects , archaeologists , professors -- practically all those who have conducted systematic archaeological research at ulpia traiana sarmizegetusa over the years .
