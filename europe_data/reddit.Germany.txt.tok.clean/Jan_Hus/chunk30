  can you give a source on that ? 
  and you must live in a warped reality if you think there 's a `` daily stream '' of such articles . 
  why `` fundamental law '' ? 
  is n't it time to stop posting this comment and its variations ( `` r/unitedkingdom wo n't like that '' ) under every thread relating to scottish independence and/or brexit ? 
  happens all the time . 
  party ideology is less important on a european stage . 
  he is right . 
  but it is also a bit sad that his own government did n't have his back . 
  if i were erdogan , i 'd know how to respond to this . 
  exactly , any restriction of freedom has to be justified . 
  in this case , i believe restricting your freedom to i.e. 
  call for muslims to be gassed is justified . 
  if we 're ever going to be in a situation where a german government bans publications calling for religious reform without our constitutional court stopping it we will have much more important problems than facebook deleting posts . 
  god beware we try to better this situation . 
  wow , germany tries to enforce its law and this sub goes mad lol . 
  this is already happening . 
  if users feel their statements were not illegal , they are free to complain on facebook . 
  it is a private company , they can delete what they want . 
   but noooo , we have to name our country `` germany '' even though it did not encompass all of the german people ... we can rectify that . 
  thanks !, 
  it seems as though research has not been comprehensive , be it due to the absence of control groups or because results of physical are muddled with chemical castration and purely psychological therapy . 
  it seems like chemical castration can be effective , but it is hard to say it either way . 
   most studies have investigated the effectiveness of `` treatment '' of sex offenders , ** where treatment typically consists in psychological therapy but may include chemical castration . 
  ** some review studies have shown a positive effect of psychiatric interventions ( mainly psychotherapy , but in some cases also including chemical castration ) on recidivism rates ( hall 1995 ; hanson 2002 ; gallagher et al. 
  1999 ; l\u00f6sel and schmucker 2005 ) , whereas others have not ( furby et al. 
  1989 ; rice and harris 2003 ) . 
  moreover , there are substantial differences in the reported effect sizes ( e.g. , d = .12 in hanson 2002 ; and d = .47 in gallagher et al. 
  l\u00f6sel and schmucker ( 2005 ) found 37 percent less sexual recidivism in treated offenders compared to controls , with the highest treatment effect in biological treatment programs ( i.e. , chemical or surgical castration ) . 
  a total of eight surgical castration studies and six chemical castration studies were included . 
  ** of the six chemical castration studies , only two found a significant reduction in recidivism rates . 
  none of the castration studies involved an equivalent control group ** ( eher et al. 
  in general , most of the studies included in these meta-analyses have methodological limitations ( e.g. , lack of a control group or nonequivalent control group , nonrandom participant assignment , small sample sizes ) ( eher and pf\u00e4fflin 2011 ) . 
  nevertheless , according to a recent review by eher and pf\u00e4fflin , there is `` evidence that treatment of sexual offender [ s ] is effective , as long as the program adheres to the principles of rnr [ risks , needs , responsivity principles ] '' ( 2011 , 9 ) . 
  a recent rnr-based meta-analysis ( hanson et al. 
  2009 ) found lower recidivism rates for treated sexual offenders compared to controls ( 10.9 percent versus 19.2 percent ) , similar to other meta-analyses ( e.g. , l\u00f6sel and schmucker 2005 : 11.1 percent versus 17.5 percent ; hanson 2002 : 12.3 percent versus 16.8 percent ) . 
  although the authors originally planned to include chemical castration studies in their meta-analysis , none of these studies met their inclusion criteria regarding minimum level of study quality . 
   are semi automatic rifles and shotguns now considerd `` fitted with high capacity magazines '' if they can take `` high capacity magazines '' ? 
  it would make sense if they were . 
  what exactly is `` bullshit '' ? 
  seems to be a fine piece of legislation . 
  the selling of `` deactivated '' weapons that are easily refitted to fire live ammunition should be controlled . 
  do you have a link ? 
  fyi : accidentally linked to the german version , but english , french and spanish translations are available . 
  do you happen to know how much lower it is compared to non-castrated offenders ? 
  i meant english people primarily . 
  while they wo n't vote , they will of course be part of the discussion . 
  oh my gosh - `` betrayal '' - use such strong words when they fit . 
  it might be betrayal if the scottish government were to declare its independence unilaterally . 
  it is just a referendum . 
  it is not a betrayal because circumstances have changed considerably . 
  they are not likely to change that much again any time soon , so talk of a `` neverendum '' is useless . 
  works the same for brexit supporters . 
  it is not particularly groundbreaking to point that out . 
  of course they did . 
  the uk leaving has changed the situation though , enough to warrant asking again . 
   we do n't get lies/propaganda from both sides and that there is honest debate to the problems scotland will face wo n't happen . 
  scotland leaving would be the end of the uk . 
  many brits are attached emotionally to their shared history in the 19th and early 20th centuries . 
  seems trivial , but the prospect of watching i.e. 
  ww1 footage of tommies waving the union jack and suddenly realising that the country they fought for no longer exists will hit too close home to allow rational discussion . 
  if you like to eat meat and can withstand freezing cold . 
  we have diplomatic relations with north korea but need to cut off all relations with turkey ? 
   a water border is far easier to guard than a land border [ ... ] the people want this to happen [ citation needed ]  5-10-30 years ago eu did n't exist 30 years ago . 
   attempting to indoctrinate the public with leftist media propaganda bullshit . 
  he will abide, 
  okay , i was seriously annoyed at a couple of points you 're bringing up . 
  rant incoming . 
   the democrats lost and their base ca n't even accept that fact so they keep crying `` russia this , russia that '' . 
  in a democracy things do n't always go our way . 
  that is why we should always listen to every concern . 
  i feel you are mistaking parts of reddit with the democratic party . 
  the party does not `` cry '' about russia and it has obviously accepted the result . 
  it however has also reacted to alarming evidence of the trump administration being in bed with putin . 
  this is ** listening to every concern ** . 
  the republicans are the ones shutting their eyes and ears . 
   people ask for immigration controls but the eu bureaucrats say `` that 's trump rhetoric '' and dismiss it . 
  sorry , but this is utter bullshit . 
  name me representative , non-distorted or misrepresented examples of eu officials saying this . 
  `` immigration controls '' - what the fuck does that even mean ? 
  going by the obvious meaning , the eu controls immigration already . 
  you as a greek should know that ( what happens if i try to walk from turkey into greece ? ) . 
  i am seriously growing tired of idiots throwing around sound bites like `` control '' while refusing to talk about how to enact this on a border that is probably ** 90 % fucking water ** . 
  the eu administration is not full of bleeding heart lefties , but believing that is probably easier than finally owning up to the fact that there are no easy answers here . 
   people ask for less centralization but eu bureaucrats want to punish the uk for opposing their notion . 
  i am baffled . 
  gold for this . 
  leaving the eu is not `` asking for less centralisation '' . 
  and how in gods name did the eu punish britain ? 
  is negotiating with ones own interests in mind now `` punishing ' ? 
  if so , why does it seem like the eu is always held to a higher standard than states like britain ( which will do the same bloody thing ) ? 
   they will vote in euroskeptic parties since the pro-european ones ignore their concerns . 
  all these legitimate concerns , to be sure . 
  completely ignored , of course . 
  is this some alternate reality now ? 
  and why do i have to take people believing that seriously ? 
  yes , and it still is . 
  statistics do n't lie , only you . 
  but why is that relevant to swabia ? 
   no , it is n't . 
  which term is better suited then ?
