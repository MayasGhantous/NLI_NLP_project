  if we go back to e.g. 
  900 ad - would you also say that poland , scandinavia and finland etc. 
  were not european at the time ? 
  it was a bit of a draw , as far as being the first nation to do something , i guess . 
  one could of course argue that the us achieved everything the soviets achieved ( satellites , manned space travel ) but the soviets did n't orchestrate a successful lunar mission which would make the us the winner . 
  at least with the downfall of the soviet union in 1991 the us definitely won . 
  there is nothing revisionist about this . 
  and initially the ussr was definitely outperforming the us , sending the first man to space and all ... 
  the race to the moon was just part of the space race . 
  pretty much the same here . 
  what does `` race '' imply ? 
  would you say albania or bosnia are european ? 
  now that we know which european cities might be overrated , which regions or places are deserving of more attention ? 
   i talk to europeans who are in their 30s and all they do is travel all around on their free time . . they do n't want to settle down and invest their money in having families . 
  they rather live off the social welfare state til i can travel on welfare . 
  well , it 's not the religion prohibiting it , but the curriculum only allows you to choose either religion or philosophy , not both . 
  as this study shows , personal contacts are just as important . 
  i do n't know if you 've been paying attention at all , but islamism is debunked and attacked dozens upon dozens of times a day , by intellectuals , media , politicians ... 
  felt the need to say how much i agree with you . 
  having philosophy classes in school opened up a new world for me . 
  it 's absolutely horrifying how one has to choose between religion and philosophy though . 
  it 's , along with psychology , a subject that ought to be mandatory . 
  also have to disagree with him on his use of `` central europe '' . 
  germany would fit his definition of `` diversity '' and it is in central europe . 
  so this is still funny ? 
   ability to govern and represent themselves ...  or the protection of our culture and interests . 
  `` catalonia 's interests '' and `` govern ourselves '' are fancy ways of saying `` yeah , it really is about the money '' . 
   ypg or  not infantry choose one, 
  ah , i get it . 
  so might makes right , does it ? 
  it goes without saying that dictatorship is by no means a modern concept . 
  in fact , it is a very ancient concept , and entirely appliccable here . 
  i do understand that some french regularly employ doublethink in order to take pride in * both * their beloved roi de soleil ** and ** the revolution of 1789 ; of libert\u00e9 , egalit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 ** while still ** believing in gaullism , conquering a colonial empire and endorsing the imposition of parisian french on other cultures , not to mention the immense task of reconciling pride of a republic that had to fend off foreign invaders to survive , with ** goddamn napoleon ** , a ruthless warlord who only ever knew life in the army , who only ever * wanted * life in the army and whose power derived from invading other countries . 
  but hungary was absolutely opposed to ferdinands plans , since it included the ethnic minorities ( actually regional majorities ) in hungary , whom it happily repressed for much of it 's `` golden age '' . 
  also most people still were dirt poor . 
  as you might be able to guess , i think the only honest answer for ( nearly ) all countries is that today is the best time of our countries . 
  are you now comparing a country to a corporation ? 
  what does that say about the country ? 
   jews had been there hundreds of years , they were not an actual problem . 
  migrants coming in the hundreds of thousands is an actual problem . 
  also , how friendly are these migrants going to be to the jewish population ? 
  a very dangerous statement that you 're able to make only because most jews in europe today tend to have a low profile , be secular and generally are few in number . 
  100 or 200 years ago , however , this was different . 
  especially before the enlightenment , there were jewish ghettos ( still existed in russia around 1900 ) , many , especially eastern jews were poor and extremely orthodox , kept to themselves - forming a parallel society and spoke their own , foreign language . 
  their birthrates were often higher above average . 
  it was the same in the west 300-200 years ago , while later they enjoyed economic success and were envied , often seen as an `` occupying '' , sinister alien people . 
  do n't romanticize jewish life in europe before the holocaust . 
  do n't pretend jews were all perfectly integrated . 
  in fact ( if we discount for a moment that today 's migrants have obviously not been here as long ) there are striking similarities between both situations . 
  this once again shows us how we need to be weary of right-wing fanatism and remember that it was based on real and actual experiences people had , drawing from them the fatal conclusions and political doctrines we all know . 
  many germans in the 20s or russians in 1890 viewed jews in a way similar to how some of us perceive refugees/immigrants today . 
   selecting those that are most vulnerable how do you define that ? 
  by measuring physical strength , age , gender ? 
  please specify . 
  i will also add that i genuinely do n't understand brits telling others to `` just fly them in '' . 
  i ca n't stress enough that doing so will not eradicate the problem the `` continent '' faces . 
  it 's all nice and cozy when you live on an island and can afford the luxury to select your refugees . 
  it 's a luxury we 'd all like to have , but we do n't . 
  no politician wants refugees , but our constitution forces us to take them in when they reach our border . 
  and that 's what happens daily , while the uk collectively freaks out over a couple refugees in calais who have n't even made it into their nation . 
  quoting u/zombiepiratefrspace  but the german government does n't want them . 
  germany has to take them by law ( german constitution ) . 
   and that 's why many german governments have worked dilligently so that the european refugee framework makes it exceedingly hard to get to germany . 
   it was actually very surprising for many germans ( like me ) that the populace of our country is overwhelmingly welcoming towards the syrian refugees , unlike the government ( which ironically , people on / r/europe keep blaming for everything ) . 
  well , unfortuntely it kind of did . 
  jewish life in germany came to a halt and only recently , due to the influx of jews from the former soviet union , did the stuation improve . 
  some time ago ( a year maybe ) der spiegel ran a cover story with an interesting interview on the issue . 
  basically , our brains are good at solving linear tasks ( i.e. 
  2 +2 = 4 ) yet are dreadfully ill-equipped to deal with exponentiality ( 2 ^ 4 ) . 
  that 's of course because during evolution we mostly had to solve simple , straight forward problems . 
  we therefore have a hard time comprehending the scale of what will happen . 
  no , we 're not . 
  tolerance , in the context of the enlightenment , is what makes us european in the first place . 
  tolerance of intolerance however , is just stupid and has nothing to do with what enlightenment tolerance stands for . 
  you can only improve and learn in the present . 
   in practical terms that would mean to have classes for new arrivals , as soon as possible , maybe only a few days after they arrived . 
  teaching them about human rights , gender equality , freedom of opinion and expression , civil duties , cooperation and `` vereinsleben '' ( however you 'd express that in english ) . 
  these sort of things . 
  i concur , so be gentle ... but `` vereinsleben '' ? 
  is this an indelible part of being german now , on par with freedom of expression or gender equality ? 
  how does it feel to know your father wants to sacrifice you in a couple of years , depending on your age ? 
  nah , since devolution wales , scotland and england are countries in the state of the united kingdom . 
  they have a lot of sovereignty . 
  if you 're actually thinking that without merkel making some misrepresented comment the current crisis would n't have occurred , you 're fooling yourself . 
  no one thinks such stuff of finland and they have the same stereotype . 
  unfortunately , germany 's borders can not be effectively controlled and people who end up here can apply for asylum . 
  also , for the umpteenth time , that 's not even what she said . 
  `` others '' do n't have the fortune of being islands with easily controllable borders . 
  `` others '' did n't want to take in any refugees in the first place . 
  to receive asylum in germany , you have to break the law and enter the eu illegally . 
  many are willing to do that , so in the end , while ireland and the uk and iceland can pretend their policies would suit all of europe , immigrants will enter the rest of europe anyway , no matter how little you like it . 
  people like to blame the current influx on merkel/germany , but it is highly likely that more or less the same number of people would have come if she had n't made the decisions she made . 
  taking in people `` from actual refugee camps '' is easy to say when there 's no other way for people to enter your country . 
  maybe you should inform others of the definitions you use beforehand . 
   hitler received the final part of his father 's estate in may 1913 and moved to munich . 
  [ 50 ] he was born 1889 in braunau am inn , which makes him 24 by 1913 . 
  before that he lived in braunau , passau and vienna . 
  not munich . 
  i guess wikipedia really is my friend then . 
  `` munich is hitlers hometown '' .
