  just because we stop subsidies does n't mean we will stop exporting . 
  the produce will be sold where the most money can be made . 
  true and all , but what exactly are you trying to say ? 
  well , it was serfdom as it was common throughout europe up to the enlightenment . 
  a serf from mecklenburg or a serf from curonia , it made no difference . 
  lol no , i do n't remember ever hearing about those in school . 
  maybe one or two sentences in a textbook but not as a topic for homework or class . 
  really , medieval history plays almost no role in history lessons in general . 
  and i do n't think the term `` slavery '' is appropiate tbh . 
  he was a total arse . 
  it says something when your own colonial administration fires you for mistreating natives . 
  the name given to him by the left german press was `` h\u00e4nge-peters '' - `` hanging peters '' . 
  germany did n't have a whole lot of colonies and their history is embedded in the general european colonisation of africa at the end of the 19th century . 
  we learn * why bismarck was opposed to them `` your map of africa is very pretty , but my map of africa lies in europe . '', 
  * why we nevertheless acquired a few * who was responsible for the acquisitions ( people like [ carl peters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_peters ) ) * that the allies took them from us after ww1 * and a bit about the herero rebellion, 
  in a globalised world , every country depends on other countries in some way though . 
  [ volkstrauertag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkstrauertag ) - people 's day of mourning . 
  for the soldiers and civilians who died in the world wars and at the hands of oppressive regimes . 
  not a single important party here is willing to actually commit and to initiate a proper federalisation process . 
  i kind of love you right now , you are the living embodiment of every existing polish stereotype . 
  studying in germany is already dirt cheap , i do n't think lots of germans want to pay even more for foreigners to study here . 
  better to do the right thing for the wrong reasons than not do anything at all because of ideology . 
  so yes , i think he still deserves credit . 
  california and texas because those are actually unique . 
  though it is a perfectly acceptable word in english as well . 
  such a trustworthy and unbiased source . 
  world war 2 probably . 
  in more recent times , the airport berlin-brandenburg that is still not finished . 
  lots , we had several reforms with the last one taking place in 1996 . 
  just one example of the effects these reforms had : a hundred years ago , it was decided that henceforth preference would be given to k instead of c , both of which were previously used interchangeably . 
  therefore e.g. 
  the town in hesse is now written [ `` kassel '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kassel ) instead of `` cassel '' , [ cologne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cologne ) `` k\u00f6ln '' instead of `` c\u00f6ln '' . 
  funnily enough , this change was not enforced everywhere and the town of [ cottbus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cottbus ) is still officially written with a c. however , the kottbusser stra\u00dfe in berlin was renamed even though its namesake was n't . 
  and it gets even more confusing : the town of [ celle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celle ) continued using c after the reform even though it was founded as * kellu * in the middle ages - which means '' ( fishing ) bay '' and is related to the root of the name [ `` kiel '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiel ) . 
  it was always pronounced with a hard k sound , like kiel or the c in canterbury for example . 
  since modern germans are no longer used to c being pronounced like that , the c today is overwhelmingly pronounced like the c in english `` cell '' . 
  weirdly enough , cottbus is still pronounced as in canterbury , and so is [ coburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coburg ) , another town that did n't make the change . 
  perfectly fine , as long as you do n't think or claim to `` have seen '' or to know germany and iceland afterwards . 
   well , we 're also still being identified as germans after 70 years as you can see in this thread . 
  i do n't . 
  and in any case , two wrongs do n't make one right . 
  more or less the same here . 
  by the 16th century it does , excluding bohemia and maybe the netherlands . 
  you know , they even added `` of the german nation '' to the title . 
  well , it was a failed attempt obviously . 
  would you also say italy had not existed before 1861 ? 
  also : [ topographia germaniae ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/topographia_germaniae ) . 
  one i kind of like the historical jan hus and second when i tried to find a user name i wanted one close to my actual name but obviously not the same . 
  so there you go . 
  the thing is that this country of germany basically is the result of an attempt to unite the general cultural area . 
  therefore it is a bit hard to separate the two ... 
  he is a pole , so i do n't think it is a german nationalist agenda . 
  just a curious person . 
  people found the prussia-austria dichotomy boring and outdated in the 20s already . 
  moreover , prussia ceased to exist 70 years ago so honestly i do n't understand why we 're still being identified with it . 
  if we 're talking about the influence of regions , modern germany is far more influenced by the swabian , rhenish and bavarian mindsets . 
  well , bavaria fits in . 
  and schleswig-holstein also does . 
  it could work . 
   my question is if austrains are like that or are they vehement about austria and germany being two different things . 
  the austrians i know are * very * vehement about it . 
  so much so in fact it is getting a bit old to me , it is like some austrians are always comparing themselves to us and trying to think of how they are completely different ( and of course better ) . 
  see , i do n't really care if a person from linz wants to associate himself with a german city or not . 
  by all means , go ahead and consider yourself german ( or do n't ) . 
  yes , places like haithabu/hedeby existed . 
  though the slaves sold there obviously were acquired in raids . 
  i 'll go there ... english and lowland scottish people are not ethnically different . 
  the lowland dwellers just ended up in the then gaelic kingdom of scotland and , after several centuries of language changes ( gaelic -  latin -  french -  old english ) and reorientation towards the southern neighbour , they became the dominant ethnicity in scotland . 
  ethnicity is a fluid concept . 
  they once considered themselves german , now for the most part they do n't do it any longer , and that is fine . 
  both of our countries are doing well on our own . 
  thanks to the eu we can travel , work and live there and vice versa so there is no real need for some sort of further unification any more . 
   is there any valid reason at all it has been by now widely acknowledged and accepted that ethnicity is above all a subjective choice and not based on objective criteria . 
  if a people honestly feels separate and different from another , then it is . 
  i see , seems to make sense . 
  and the 25 % of atheists ? 
  harald bluetooth converted in 960 . 
  even though the people likely took a few centuries longer to convert , most of danish history was as a christian country . 
  and pre-christian denmark was n't terribly civilised . 
  dispersed tribal communities living from raiding , a bit of trade and subsistence farming ? 
  sounds exactly like pre-christian germany to me . 
  i liked the special effects in the ruyter movie but was n't too impressed with the writing ti be honest . 
   their heads held high , surrounded by the cultural depth and historical strength which builds their character and backbone of a unified , but also independant land . 
  this has been forgotten in recent times , and it has led to an undoubtable but misplaced inferiority complex . 
  jesus christ , do you honestly think brits are having an inferiority complex right now ? 
  or that their heads have ever not been high ? 
  i mean i appreciate the sentiment but this just seems completely off . 
  hochdeutsch is standard german in colloquial usage though  in a linguistic sense swiss alemannic dialects would be high german . 
  and nzz certainly does not write in z\u00fcrich dialect . 
  that is just the swiss way of writing standard german . 
  schwizerd\u00fctsch is [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/79we237awzw?t=589 ), 
  this one ? 
  perfectly normal standard german . 
  point is that nzz writes in standard german , not schwizerd\u00fctsch . 
  if that is schwizerd\u00fctsch then all swiss people i 've heard talking must have been speaking a different language . 
  no problem . 
  i really like `` ich hab die nacht getr\u00e4umet '' , zupfgeigenhansel is an instant win to me !, 
  most of these renditions are too pompous or distanced for my taste . 
  you do n't need dozens of professional singers to sing these pieces of music . 
  that actually is the whole point of * folk * songs .
