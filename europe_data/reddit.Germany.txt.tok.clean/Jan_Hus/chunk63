  you have missed this then :  i do n't mean to start an argument over the truth of these claims , but i find the way they are presented often misleading and  it 's fine to hold that opinion . 
  but do n't use the term `` fiscal union '' then . 
  the point of this post was obviously not to argue for the transformation of the ez into a fiscal union . 
  have you even read my post ? 
  this is a difficult topic . 
  essentially , we 're all in a myriad of fiscal unions . 
  just think of that part in your town with really high unemployment and low average income . 
  everyone draws borders on where he/she does n't want to put up with supporting poorer people . 
  for most , that 's their national borders - for many here it even was the * neue bundesl\u00e4nder * . 
  personally i could see my border including europe , but , as op says , with the institutional and legally binding framework that goes with a fiscal union ( at that point the eu has basically become a country ) . 
   oh , look a strawman , having to stretch to try and make an argument are we ? 
  i only ever said you were wrong . 
  which you are . 
  yeah , it certainly would n't make sense if i were to assume you support danubis 's comment . 
  / s  so you take the period of roman subjugation and add that to the period of ottoman subjugation , and ** then ** you get the total period in which the greek 's hoplites failed to defend them from subjugation thanks for clarifying you 're not talking about continuous periods of time . 
  could have come earlier to be honest . 
  ( greeks being subjugated by greeks during the eastern roman times is still bullshit though ), 
  actually that 's pretty much what it was . 
  of course people thought it would happen in the far future so most did n't concern themselves with it . 
  and a `` gerxit '' would n't be about not reforming the euro , it would mean destroying it . 
  [ it was . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_empire#nomenclature )  the byzantine empire was known to its inhabitants as the `` roman empire '' , the `` empire of the romans '' ( latin : imperium romanum , imperium romanorum ; greek : \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd basileia t\u014dn rh\u014dmai\u014dn , \u1f08\u03c1\u03c7\u1f74 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd arch\u0113 t\u014dn rh\u014dmai\u014dn ) , `` romania '' ( latin : romania ; greek : \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 rh\u014dmania ) , [ n 2 ] the `` roman republic '' ( latin : res publica romana ; greek : \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd politeia t\u014dn rh\u014dmai\u014dn ) , graikia ( greek : \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 ) , and also as rh\u014dmais ( greek : \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u0390\u03c2 ) . 
  [ 12 ] the inhabitants called themselves romaioi and graikoi , and even as late as the 19th century greeks typically referred to their modern language as romaika and graikika . 
  and  the first use of the term `` byzantine '' to label the later years of the roman empire was in 1557 , when the german historian hieronymus wolf published his work corpus histori\u00e6 byzantin\u00e6 , a collection of historical sources . 
  the term comes from `` byzantium '' , the name of the city of constantinople before it became constantine 's capital . 
  [ ... ] however , it was not until the mid-19th century that the term came into general use in the western world . 
  you 're aware of the division of the roman empire in 285 ? 
  this is the eastern half . 
  anyway , the point is u/danubis and you claimed the greeks were subjugated for 2000 years , when the main greek state fell only in 1453 . 
  it 's basic math , really . 
  even if you do n't agree with 1453 as the appropiate caesura , the end of greek independence will be around that date . 
  if you 're saying we should have one or two working languages , then i 'm fine with that . 
  i never said i wanted everyone to communicate via interpreters when making smalltalk . 
  but that 's already happening !, 
  speaking in maltese is extremely uncommon among eu politicians . 
  but if by having  one on eu-level for governance you mean that we should have one official language and laws should n't be translated anymore , then i wholeheartedly disagree .

  so as far as percentages go , even young people do n't support you more ? 
  i 'm no expert on spanish politics , but lots and lots of things can change in a decade or two . 
  or are non-catalan spanish youth just as opposed to catalan autonomy and language use ? 
   i do n't know why you felt need to add that . 
  i guess some peole like to antagonize others with patronizing remarks . 
  i meant it . 
  do n't get so worked up over something on the internet . 
   i know it would be difficult since already people are screaming about cultural domination on slightest suggestion of introducing common language . 
  we 're talking about actually instituting it as the official language , not about suggestions . 
   ok , we can go with polish , it will be more fair since we were conquered few times in last 300 years . 
  fine ? 
  i do n't wa n't the eu to have one language dominating other , be it polish or english . 
  true , english is the lingua franca of the world , and we need a common method of understanding each other ( preferably one that does n't change all the time ) but there 's a difference between using it out of habit and using it as an official language . 
  do that and it will be less than 100 years until the eu falls apart because people fight back or your national language is replaced by english . 
   great ideal , except most people ( including me ) do n't understand the laws in their own language due to complicated and technical language . 
  of course you do . 
  laws have to be technical , but i assume you comprehend grammar and at least the basic words ? 
  then all you need is to educate yourself on the subject a bit and you 'll understand it . 
   there will be no more integration if we do not sacrifice a little bit of this diversity and without further integration eu will be just a bunch of bickering , arguing countries while china swallows us . 
  all that 's needed for that is to have a working language ( which we have ) , but we do not need to abandon our own languages for that . 
  multilingualism is key . 
  huh ? 
  greek was lingua franca anyway and after 610 it became the official language . 
  by and large , it was greeks running the empire . 
  due to translatio imperii , german emperors also said they were romans for most of our history , that does n't make them roman , right ? 
  hsv of course . 
  and at this point i ca n't tell if it 's mockery or sympathy whenever someone wishes us luck . 
  maybe . 
  but by what standard do you want to decide which language gets interpreted and which does n't ? 
  the current system is built on official languages of member states , an apt solution i 'd say . 
  the eu officially tries to protect regional/minority languages but if you want catalan to have official representation in the eu parliament , first convince madrid to have it used in the spanish one . 
  okay , it 's in fact 562 years . 
  my bad . 
  i assumed he was using it in the most widespread meaning . 
  technological advancements are cool , but i 'd like to be able to survive even during a blackout or when my battery fails . 
  calm down . 
  the only legal way to have english as the sole ( working ) language and save the cost of translating would be to institute it as the official eu language or as an official language of every member state . 
  that 's a difficult measure to enact for a union priding itself on `` united in diversity '' . 
  moreover , by what merit do you want to justify using english ? 
  because we were historically more successful at conquering and forcing our language on other people ? 
  not fair . 
  in practice the eu only has two `` working languages '' , english and french , which is pretty uncomplicated , to be honest . 
  but ** every ** citizen needs to be able to understand the laws passed in his name . 
  remember , only about 50 % of eu citizens understand english . 
  language diversity is something we should cherish , as it forms an indelable part of our national - speaking our national tongue - and european identity - learning and enjoying foreign languages . 
  edit : wrote `` working '' , meant `` official '' . 
  look at the sidebar . 
  do you think it 's feasible to pay for the interpretation of 230 languages ? 
  people still do n't understand that the euro is not an exclusively economic project . 
  i do n't get this impulse people seem to have whenever something does n't work the way it should . 
  everyone panics and wants to quit instead of reforming the system so it actually works . 
  try to imagine what life would be like if the first humans encountering fire had panicked and ran away instead of slowly learning to control it . 
  when talking about nations and people , you normally mean they 're subjugated by other people . 
  look , when scotland was independent in the middle ages , the scots were still subjugated by their feudal lords and kings . 
  but you would n't say that , because by subjugation you mean people being ruled by foreigners . 
  at least in this context . 
  is money a problem ? 
  if not , [ invest 300.000 $ in hungary ] ( http://helpers.hu/services/immigration/investment-program/?gclid=ci3x6snn4mycfqnltaodmrimrg ) and you obtain permanent residence as well as easier access to citizenship . 
  i just saw a beautiful thing . 
  you mean about 600 . 
  you actually believe the majority of humans without work want to be in the situation they are in ? 
  yeah , let 's go back to 19th century suffrage laws .
