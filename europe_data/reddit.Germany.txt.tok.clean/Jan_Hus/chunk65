  while the debt may very well be unsustainable , the greeks need to realise that their current crisis is not the result of `` evil creditors '' wanting to destroy their country but simply a consequence of them overspending and living a life they could n't afford . 
  so when talking about debt restructuring or insolvency , we need to get rid of the idea that greece * should * return to prosperity . 
  the prosperity it had was unsustainable and if we just write it off , what will keep the new government from overspending again ? 
  moreover , greek debt is not odious debt . 
  the greeks did profit massively from foreign money , not just an elite caste . 
  so following a write-off , only a suicidal politician ( or a saint ) would try to fight the rampart cronyism and inefficiency & ** not ** let the state quota go up again etc. 
  it 's also good for our ego . 
  all the cool nations have minorities . 
  just look at britain . 
  polen gib back ... oh wait . 
  we do n't do that anymore . 
  my bad . 
  ( also there are no poles in lusatia . ), 
  where to deposit my fortune now ? 
  / s i hope you noticed my skilled use of formatting to let readers know l\u00ebtzebuerg 's independence is guaranteed . 
  right , but the map is about countries , not individuals . 
  just saying that neither map nor i dispute the truth of your statement . 
  but this is a relatively new development . 
  up and well into the 20th century the orthodox faith shaped your country . 
  i 'm irreligious too but where i live , protestantism has done the same . 
  * german revisionism activated * ** actually ** ^ tm the country of luxemburg is - theoretically - completely german . 
  the true french part of luxemburg has been annexed to belgium in the 19th century . 
  it 's still called the province of luxemb ( o ) urg . 
  and he was right . 
  the fit survived and he 's dead . 
   eu investment fund invest in what ? 
   fighting corruption and tax evasion how ? 
  i agree with your initial statement regarding the importance of growth . 
  have you read the faz article posted ? 
  how do you propose to reform the system described there and why do you think pumping money in it will result in sustainable growth ? 
  i will be honest here - there 's simply no use arguing about this , because the term `` continent '' has no universally accepted definition . 
  if you follow physical geography , then you have to discard europe and africa as continents , together with the terms north - and south america . 
  not saying that 's wrong - but this is not an issue you ca n't find a definite answer to . 
  others will bring up definitons from human geography and tell you that europe and africa are different enough to warrant being called continent . 
  others may say the same of south asia , while others again will find reasons to dispute that . 
   other than pure eurocentrism and insecure europeans wanting to feel special , there are no definitions for europe being a continent . 
  europe claiming to be a continent is as laughable as china claiming to be a continent . 
  there are a bunch of reasons , the most important being that , as mentioned above , continents are always arbitrary human constructs . 
  take islands for example . 
  australia gets to be a continent , but we group greenland with america , indonesia with asia . 
  makes no sense . 
  there are a bunch of reasons why europe should be it 's own continent ( that 's also what 's taught in china , so they do n't seem to have any problems with it ) . 
  before the suez canal africa , europe and asia formed one continuous landmass . 
  did people call it eurafricasia ? 
  the definition of continent includes more than geography . 
  well , i have the current one here and i do n't see how it 's trashy . 
  still , there 's no use arguing over what essentially seems a difference in opinion . 
  this should be on r/yurop . 
  edit : and it is !, 
  spiegel data is actually 0,89 ( ~ 0,9 ) mill . 
  circulation but you 're right , my initial numbers were wrong and bild indeed has higher circulation - however ( ! ), 
  you ca n't simply add in bild am sonntag , the readers are basically the same as for bild . 
  no one reads bams without reading bild , it would also be wrong to claim faz and fasz readers are different . 
  let 's take into account , however , that this actually does n't say much . 
  the german tabloid market is completely dominated by bild . 
  look at the uk market , which has much more competition : the sun and daily mail together have 3,5 mill . 
  circulation , much more than bild . 
  it would seem that tabloids usually have higher circulation , in germany and elsewhere . 
  as to your comment on spiegel - if you consider that one `` pretty trashy '' , you 're completely disconnected from reality . 
  at least name a newspaper you find good so i can understand what you 're expecting . 
  i 'd like to see your sources then . 
  as far as i know my numbers are correct . 
  weekly/daily does n't really matter , circulation is circulation . 
  a weekly 's impact is usually higher ( spiegel and zeit have way more investigative content ) . 
  as to the quality of the content , i 'd like to know what your standards are . 
  it 's easy to claim everything goes downhill , most often it 's harder to prove it . 
  two things : 1 . 
  what greece did n't ( sufficiently ) do , was to overhaul it 's administration . 
  tax evasion , cronyism , corruption and incompetence everywhere . 
  that 's what really drags it down . 
  ( assuming this reflects your opinion ) since greece would n't have enacted austerity measures without pressure from the creditors , you can only be against both troika and austerity when you doubt that austerity was necessary . 
  to that i will say that greece * had * to balance it 's budget and that it 's not the creditor 's fault that greece overspent previously . 
   of germans bild circulation is 3.5 million . 
  spiegel has more than twice as many readers . 
  welt , zeit and s\u00fcddeutsche together have more than that . 
  add in the numerous other quality newspapers and tv channels and your `` impression '' might change . 
  every nation 's got tabloids , no need to freak out or start pointing fingers . 
  comparing the london debt agreement and greece 's current situation is nothing short of ludicrous . 
  * by 1953 germany had been under 8 years of military occupation , it 's political and economic institutions having been ** completely overhauled ** - something ( the overhaul ) greece refuses to commit to . 
  * helping germany was in the geopolitical interest of the usa , considering how west germany served as a bullwark against communism for the remainder of the cold war . 
  it was ** not ** charity . 
  * the debt relief was ** not free : ** the winners profited massively from forced labour of hundreds of thousands of german civilians and pow 's to work on farms or to clear minefields . 
  they also profited from the deportation of industrial capacity , german resources , patents and inventions . 
  there were huge restrictions on german industrial sectors , on the amount and quality of steel they were allowed to use , there were regulations ensuring some resource exports were sold at 50 % of value etc. 
  maybe the average american just does n't remember these events , but this is why ... 
   then keep seething with rage . 
  there are idiots everywhere but if anyone behaves all smug and thinks they 're smart or `` intellectual '' it 's left pro-greek posters who decide to ignore major problems with both the practical ability and theoretical concept of syriza just so they can spout anti-capitalist drivel that has nothing to do with the issue at hand . 
  by that i especially mean foreigners , if they 're greek i kind of understand , though by no means support it . 
  the point of my original comment was not to lay out my view of the greek crisis in detail but to specifically attack one of the many claims you made over comments on r/europe . 
  you want to talk about something else ? 
  fine , but do it , do n't start swearing , it 's childish . 
  you can change that , or not ? 
  so i assert something and instead of challenging me with fact-based arguments you start to insult me and switch to dutch for no reason ? 
  that 's not what i said , and you know it . 
  in fact , i 've hardly seen a better example of smugness and dishonesty on the pro-greek side . 
  but i guess that happens if you 're out of arguments . 
  then keep seething with rage . 
  there are idiots everywhere but if anyone behaves all smug and thinks they 're smart or `` intellectual '' it 's left pro-greek posters who decide to ignore ** major problems ** with both the practical ability and theoretical concept of syriza just so they can spout anti-capitalist drivel that has nothing to do with the issue at hand . 
  by that i especially mean foreigners , if they 're greek i kind of understand , though by no means support it . 
  the problem is : where 's the incentive to enact hard reforms if your debt gets written off .
