  [ world war i ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i ) [ world war ii ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii ), 
  not for a particular hike , but i recommend going to the tourist information and getting a map with hiking trails . 
  they are usually well-signposted by the schwarzwaldverein ( look out for signs with that name ) . 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://www.baden-baden.de/en/tourist-information/black-forest-national-park/ ) website is of use to you . 
  it is a weekly , not a daily , so i did n't include it . 
  it is up there with sz and faz though and i would consider it a newspaper too . 
  if you have the time while staying in baden-baden , consider to go hiking in the black forest . 
  copying from another comment of mine : generally almost everyone learns ** english ** after fifth grade , however primary schools and even kindergartens are increasingly starting to teach english in earlier grades . 
  in 6th or 7th grade a second language has to be chosen . 
  traditionally the choice was between ** french ** and ** latin ** , however latin has diminished in importance greatly the last decades and most students now choose either french and ** spanish ** . 
  there are considerable differences between type of school and the * bundesl\u00e4nder * . 
  for example , some traditional * gymnasiums * might choose to offer a more classical education with greater emphasis on ** latin ** and even ** greek ** . 
  some schools also offer classes in ** chinese ** , ** japanese ** ** russian ** or ** italian ** for example . 
  in border regions , a neighbouring country 's language might be given more attention , i.e. 
  near alsace , where i live , ** french ** is often even taught in primary schools . 
  the same applies to ** dutch ** and more rarely to ** danish ** or ** polish ** . 
  in east germany , one can still find a considerable number of schools offering lessons in ** russian ** . 
  if one attends one of the few schools with a specific national background one might even encounter languages such as ** lithuanian ** , ** sorbian ** ** low german ** or ** frisian ** being taught . 
  i knew this would trigger a dane . 
  :p do n't complain , at least not as long as droves of you are shopping in flensburg . 
  bl\u00e5vand , varde kommune . 
  in denmark . 
  turkey does not have the death penalty . 
  of course , extra-judicial killings of any kind are . 
  that is why generally war of any kind should be avoided . 
  killing as part of warfare and as official punishment are two different things entirely . 
  [ rathaus of cards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b59h8-clq6u&amp;feature=youtu.be ) as for non-humorous series , i do n't think so . 
  something in me also really amused at the idea of a house of cards in berlin , with german politics . 
  i mean , yes , it 'd be crazy to assume there is no intrigue or backstabbing going on and borgen worked even though danish politics are even more boring . 
  still the thought is weird . 
  last weekend i did n't . 
  why ? 
   germany : also quite gritty and dark i prescribe a till schweiger romcom as a remedy . 
  meh , i believe you are blowing the k\u00fcnast thing out of proportion . 
  i have heard of it of course . 
   they faked their statistics to get into the eu and they have pived beyond their means for so many years , so they deserve to get punished . 
  who deserves to get punished ? 
  the whole greek people , for generations to come ? 
  but they did n't commit any crime . 
  at utmost , maybe the person responsible for faking data . 
  everyone was fully aware of the fake statistics btw . 
   let me give you a specific example : can you imagine that in any country the police get criticized by major politicians for stopping a terrorist int the middle of his act with a deadly shot ? 
  happened so in germany . 
  give the specific example you 're on about . 
  in any case , we have freedom of opinion here ; and yes , i can imagine other countries where the police is not above and beyond all criticism . 
   our defense minister is trying to turn our troops into some loser/bedwetter gang full of pussies . 
  i do n't like zensursula , but this is nevertheless bullshit . 
  well you did n't even specify what `` standing up '' is supposed to mean . 
  greeks for example will certainly tell you that we managed to `` stand up '' for ourselves pretty well during the eurozone crisis . 
  we are deporting illegal immigrants by the way . 
  and though some organisations and activists will always criticise that , the majority does not . 
  actually the debate is not about deportations per se but about deportations into war zones . 
  and even then , `` racist '' is still a rare and serious accusation in german public discourse . 
  honestly , i do n't even completely disagree with your views but you 're still oversimplifying and just throwing soundbites out there . 
  well as you said yourself , a system with junior ministers would not be equal . 
  and the commission is not meant to represent the countries , the council exists for that very purpose . 
  officially the commissioners are n't there to represent their countries anyways . 
  there is the council for that . 
  on the contrary , i believe maintaining the current system fosters euroscepticism . 
  and when montenegro joins we 'll just invent a new highly-paid commissioner post who will contribute nothing of worth at all ? 
  how long should that go on ? 
  28 + ministers are far too many to effectively run a bureaucracy . 
  for example the way art . 
  17 5 teu specifies it :  as from 1 november 2014 , the commission shall consist of a number of members , including its president and the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , corresponding to two thirds of the number of member states , unless the european council , acting unanimously , decides to alter this number . 
   the members of the commission shall be chosen from among the nationals of the member states on the basis of a system of strictly equal rotation between the member states , reflecting the demographic and geographical range of all the member states . 
  this system shall be established unanimously by the european council in accordance with article 244 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  it is n't germany , but there is [ deutschlandsberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutschlandsberg ) in austria . 
  however the settlement was originally just landsberg , with `` deutsch '' being added to distinguish the settlement from windisch-landsberg in today 's slovenia .

  1 , 81m is german average , but as i said i 'm actually above average ( 1 , 87 m ) . 
  this whole comment tree could have been averted if you guys had switched to metric . 
  above average . 
  1,81 m is average for german males . 
  well , it 'd be better to speak of a majority of voters . 
  you might be right , being a german i might not be able to distinguish the subtle differences in international flag.worship . 
  is it really worshipped that much compared to la tricolore in france for example ? 
  or the dannebrog . 
  okay , they pledge allegiance to it , but `` and the republic for which it stands '' is the more important part . 
  dutch people . 
  their own language is quite harsh and hoarse , but when they switch to german , it sounds pleasant to me . 
  the actual celtic word is ** tragisam\u0101 * but i like your explanation better , 
  the [ dreisam ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rawotzo.jpg ) ( from celtic , meaning `` very fast '' ) is about appropriate in size for freiburg . 
  [ at the elbe ] ( https://youtu.be/9viw3fvmc5w ) is more of a soldier 's song about elbe day . 
  and you have to explain why you 're looking for elbe songs op , 
  if i 'd plan to stay indefinitely/forever , then yes , absolutely . 
  if i am only there for a few years , then i 'd learn some basic irish at least . 
  for shorter periods of time ? 
  he probably is . 
  unfortunately our word for the mainstream protestant lutheran church is `` evangelisch '' . 
  for small countries it was never different , you know .
