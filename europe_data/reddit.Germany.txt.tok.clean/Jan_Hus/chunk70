  from my experience , their coverage is fast and pretty trustworthy . 
  and if you look beyond the main news like ` tagesschau ' , their correspondents do informative and balanced documentaries on the countries they are stationed in . 
  a good part of investigative research also happens . 
  i know a lot of people like to make fun of them for being ` old peoples ' tv and some even claim they 're propaganda networks indoctrinating the population . 
  ridiculous , if you ask me . 
  those are the same people prefering to get their news from dubious blogs or even * russia today * . 
  point me to one incidence were their accusations are true ( i ca n't remember any bad coverage on m-15 or the spanish protests ) . 
  ** germany ** * ** die zeit ** a weekly known for long , quality articles . 
  best described as centrist , maybe a bit left-leaning . 
  has the largest circulation of weeklies . 
  based in hamburg . 
  * ** faz ( frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ) ** a conservative daily , tends to support cdu . 
  * ** die welt ** axel springer 's ` quality ' newspaper , circulating daily and centre-right on the political spectrum . 
  from hamburg * ** s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung ** a very influential daily with hq 's in munich . 
  politically it is centre-left . 
  expanded it 's cultural segment considerably . 
  together with zeit and faz regarded as germany 's high quality newspaper . 
  * ** bild ** axel springer 's main publication . 
  the tabloid . 
  now based in berlin , it has the highest circulation though no one with self-esteem admits to reading it . 
  writes whatever they believe will generate moral panic and sales . 
  * ** der spiegel ( the mirror ) ** weekly news magazine , high circulation and prestige , known for in-depth coverage of politics , economics and culture , domestic and abroad . 
  centre-left . 
  based in hamburg . 
  * ** focus ** conservative news magazine , madly in love with cdu . 
  economically liberal . 
  not nearly as regarded as spiegel . 
  * ** public tv ** the main public broadcasters , ard and zdf are generally quite good in terms of news coverage . 
  zdf is said to be a bit more right , ard a bit more left of centre . 
  their digital spinoffs like phoenix , tagesschau24 , zdfinfo and the franco-german channel arte are very good , albeit not watched by many . 
  * ** private tv ** mostly trash . 
  only good for foreign series or movies public tv wo n't show . 
  can someone explain estonia to me ? 
  they are very different from the other baltics . 
  my knowledge , too , is limited to this . 
  overlooked that , sorry . 
  hate to be that guy , but you can call the schizophrenic mess called azerbaijan european , turkic and iranian but really , really not arabic . 
  it 's 4,91 mil , as far as i know . 
  with now 650.000 civil servants that would mean ~ 1 in 7 . 
  that sounds like a cheap excuse . 
  why and most importantly how would anyone forbid them to pass reforms ? 
  well , left-wingers will point out that corruption etc. 
  was still there under the old governments & that the austerity measures hurt the poor , not the rich and effectively disabled vital services such as medicine . 
  i hear both stories so i 'm torn in a way . 
  do you believe balanced spending and austerity is possible without these negative implications while still being effective ? 
  you going to equate u/greco2k with his country and refuse to react to the points he made ? 
  this is an interesting topic . 
  was greece less successful than i.e. 
  portugal due to structural differences , because their reforms were n't enough and/or not as effective/extensive ? 
  or were they on their way to success until syriza came ? 
  from someone without much understanding of greek domestic politics , i believed tsipras , varoufakis etc. 
  have been given the chance to govern and still did n't achieve a lot . 
  can you elaborate on that ? 
  is domestic pressure really that high ? 
  i do n't speak on behalf of officials i never elected . 
   converts are traitors , the winner takes it all ( summarized ) talk about european values  i do n't see this pardon as inherently wrong neither do i. i like it . 
  but it 's excluding people with the same claim . 
  i do n't like that . 
  that 's good . 
  but that means you support their return not because you want to set things right but because they speak romance . 
  i guarantee you there are descendants of expelled spaniard muslims unable to speak spanish . 
  you do n't want them . 
  fine . 
  but not speaking spanish does not wipe out the injustice done to them . 
  therefore , this is about language and culture , not about undoing the crimes of 1492 and later . 
  and that 's all i said and i 'll stick to that . 
  way to go , not contributing anything to the discussion , then succeeding in reaching an even lower level . 
  safe your time if that 's all you have to say . 
  obvious troll is obvious . 
  do n't trouble yourself , i wo n't say more than that . 
  so this is about language , after all . 
  not about ` historic injustice ' . 
  it 's fine , by the way . 
  but say it , do n't pretend it 's something it really is n't . 
  i 'd advise you to read the other comments as many of your points have been answered there . 
  as to the ` they were conquerors ' myth : wrong , they were romance ( call it spanish , if you want to ) and most often converts , not arabs . 
  even if they were , can you really hold people responsible for what some of their ancestors did centuries ago . 
  i thought spaniards knew that , considering their crimes in america which , following your rationale , were reason enough for latin american countries to exile spanish citizens living there . 
   usa and cuba please direct your anger over this to the respective officials . 
  though i 'm sure cuba would like to say a thing or two about having been turned into a spanish colony . 
   merkel , luftwaffe etc. 
  i 'm not merkel 's press spokesman , thanks . 
  also i do n't care if you feel she 's a bit  assholish this is not about spain-germany relations , it 's about a law that is sold to the public with misleading and hypocritical rhetoric . 
  i did n't decide to make this about spanish ego or whatever you 're talking about now . 
  also sorry for trying to improve stuff when i obviously should have ` celebrated ' this scam made law . 
  truly , it would have been wiser to just ignore the ` wrongs that have n't been righted ' . 
  thanks for the input . 
  neandertals and homo sapiens have a common ancestor though . 
  well , we all come from that one piece of matter that evolved into a living cell . 
  and all humans are related anyway . 
  see ? 
  so spain cares about ` undoing justice ' only when they 're  culturally spanish and thus it 's hypocritical to claim what they claim to do and that 's my whole point . 
  besides , 16th century spaniards would get very mad at the notion a jew could be spanish and thus entitled to live in spain . 
  also , i seriously doubt people like benjamin disraeli or baruch spinoza could be called ` spanish in culture ' and their descendants certainly ca n't . 
  again , i welcome this law . 
  but pretending it 's about undoing injustice is hypocritical and populist . 
  never and immediately . 
  yes , reality is that cruel and unfair . 
  if you want to be completely honest , the only natives of europe are the hunter-gatherers that got here before everyone else . 
  so they 're probably not even homo sapiens and the languages we speak hail from a foreign invading people .
