  i knew some elder people who had fled to western germany and broke out in tear when they finally saw what the communists had done to their homelands . 
  nah normal people are boring . 
  where 's the fun in that ? 
   thank you for having such a weird voting system frenchies . 
  essentially , all voting system can produce weird results i fear . 
   afaik , the people that gave saxony its name was the ascanian ( anhalt ) dynasty from north germany ? 
  yes you 're right of course . 
  my explanation is very misleading as i skipped several decades . 
  you seem to know a lot about medieval history . 
  are you a student ? 
  anyway , i 'm from neddersassen . 
  that 's why i want my name back . 
  many german regions and federal states are named after germanic tribes , e.g. 
  bavaria and also saxony . 
  but in the case of saxony the name and the people are completely unrelated . 
  the duchy of saxony used to be what is now lower saxony in northwestern germany and was quite prestigious as it was one of the oldest duchies of the empire . 
  during the middle ages the duke of saxony revolted against emperor barbarossa , but was eventually defeated . 
  subsequently , he was stripped of most of his titles and the title duke of saxony was transferred to the house of wettin who ruled over parts of eastern germany . 
  over the centuries , the name saxony became more and more associated with that region in eastern germany rather than the place it actually originate from . 
  bavaria is saxon clay i fear . 
  make saxony great again i say . 
  gib back sovereignty over bavaria . 
  and most importantly gib back our name . 
  that 's great , i always thought the only problem with the british was that they drove on the wrong side . 
  now i realize that the plumbing is just as horrible . 
  nah , it 's not the same , especially older people can get quite angry if you lump them all together . 
  culturally i think there are three distinct parts . 
  westphalia , rural , rather wealthy , and conservative . 
  then there 's the ruhr area which is very much working class . 
  this means they vote left , not conservative like westphalia . 
  it 's also rundown a bit , as it never recovered from the steel crisis . 
  finally , there 's the rhineland which historically spoke a different dialect than the rest of nrw . 
  it 's not so poor but quite different from the rest . 
  also a bit conservative , though not as much as westphalia . 
  they drink their own beer which no one else likes here and have a few strange customs and are generally proud of being `` different '' . 
  maybe you could compare it to new york city vs. 
  upstate new york . 
  ah , just like home . 
  this is an aerial view of northern lower saxony which is where i come from .

  http://www.piraten-verden.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/youtubehintergrund-e1472588959338.png or further east . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/neegroben_-_zur_boerse.jpg there 's not much untouched nature left . 
  outside of national parks , this is about as good as it gets . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/motel%2c_dreiluetzow%2c_wittendoerp2.jpg/1024px-motel%2c_dreiluetzow%2c_wittendoerp2.jpg i do n't think people are radically different compared to cities . 
  imo , the difference between east and west or north and south is much bigger than between rural and urban areas within a region . 
  there 's no area in germany which fits all criteria . 
  the ruhr area has the largest population here , but it 's more comparable to the us rust belt as it has never recovered from the steel crisis . 
  the south is the most wealthy part , but it 's also very conservative socially . 
  berlin is culturally the most influential part i guess . 
  at least many wannabe artists live there . 
  i think berlin can be best compared to portland as it 's the hipster capital of germany . 
  the only rivalry that truly matters . 
  it 's a shame you adopted the german approach and started playing badly , you used to be so good . 
  even worse , you 're still missing a critical part . 
  germany used to play poorly but won nontheless . 
  right now dutch football is in a weird state , you play poorly like the germans did and constantly lose like you always did . 
   never forget rudi v\u00f6ller 's hair . 
  it 's funny how everyone remembers frank rijkaard but no one remembers toni schumacher . 
  i 'll just leave this here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_economic_freedom, 
  yeah , i was a bit rash . 
  is my comment bad ? 
  i did n't mean to offend anyone . 
  ah , the british and their lovely understatements . 
  i do n't think you guys binge drink . 
  maybe it 's because high school and college students coming to europe find it amazingly easy to get booze , even as a minor . 
  the result is that they drink as much as they can , as often as they can , before they return to the us and its strict laws . 
  this , at least , was my experience with exchange students who were almost always wasted . 
  the local dialects of westphalia are n't very different from dutch . 
  the franks who would conquer holland originated from that area . 
  that expression might well have always existed on both sides of the border . 
  your german 's good , but unless my english 's rusty , `` i 've been gone '' implies that you 've gone away and have * not * returned . 
  at least not yet . 
  i only use that expression in an expression like i 've been gone for six weeks now , meaning i left home six weeks ago and have n't returned yet . 
   we use different tones to make a distinction between words . 
  are you from limburg ? 
   i 've been gone that would be ` ich bin weg ' in german . 
  we 're feeling a bit racist today , are n't we ? 
   looking at the impact of the two cultures on the world , clearly american culture is worse i 'd love to know in what way american wars could possibly be compared to the second sino-japanese war . 
  as far as i know , americans never killed 20 million chinese or mass-raped nanjing . 
  i do n't know whether there 's an international version available at all , but ` absolute giganten ' is my favourite german film . 
  it 's about three friends who spend one last night together before one of them leaves . 
  the soundtrack is amazing and the happy parts where the protagonists are glad to spend time together and the sad parts where they realise that this will be the end of their friendship contrast very nicely . 
  sweden has too many great movies . 
  is very good , too . 
  i also liked nattvardsg\u00e4sterna and fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l . 
  which is strange as the normal procedure is to simply go out and get asked what you would like to buy . 
  in north germany , adverbs can be used as adjectives . 
  you do n't say the window is ` closed ' , ` geschlossen ' here , the window is ` to ' , ` zu ' . 
  moreover , you can rip compounds apart . 
  words like ` daf\u00fcr ' , therefor , can be split , with ` da ' being at the beginning of the sentence and ` f\u00fcr ' at the very end . 
  individualism , the japanese system where you 're pressured to fit in is horrible . 
  i 'd much rather do my own thing . 
  japanese is a very odd language . 
  it might be related to korean or even turkish , but we do n't know for sure . 
  anyway , japanese does have tones , but this fact is n't mentioned in class . 
  it 's even worse because the tones in japanese 's two most important dialects differ vastly . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_pitch_accent no offence , but yes , i do think you underestimate the linguistic diversity in east asia . 
  the philippines alone have something like 120 different languages . 
  not like i 'm any better , i 've managed to write ` and ' instead of ` are ' . 
  i always wondered why germans adopted cake and turned it into keks rather than the real english word for biscuit .
