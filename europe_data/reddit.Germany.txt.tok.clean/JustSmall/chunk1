as far as we know they did nothing wrong . 
  giving people advise as to how to live their lifes is totally legal , wether you agree with that or not . 
  obviously the police also knows that certain movements by salafists could pose some danger so they 're watching them . 
  there 's no need to get so edgy about this ... . 
  there is no fun in eurovision , only suffering . 
  ha , the bow will be of no use if you lack the necessary arrows !, 
  germany will trade you 16 feathers for 8 buckets of milk . 
  it 's actually fairly easy to understand ( written ) dutch , but i guess i might have the bonus of being able to understand low german which is very closely related to dutch . 
  i read that the definition of g8 is as following :  the group of eight ( g8 ) is a forum for the governments of a group of eight leading industrialised countries . 
  that 's why i thought china also fills that criteria . 
  out of curiosity : if russia was to be expelled from the g8 , would the remaining members stay as g7 ( the way it originally was ) or get another state to join , like china , india or brazil ? 
  i 'm not sure about the post linking to youtube , but was n't rt banned in a lot of places for some reason ? 
  might have to do with that . 
  also , i would n't too quickly judge them . 
  they might have accidentally removed the post or maybe it got caught in the spamfilter . 
  you 're right , thanks for correcting it . 
  kinda meta comment : i 'm not sure if it 's just me noticing it recently but have there been more image postings ( often with no further explanation or possibly discussion ) in this subreddit ? 
  i really hope this does not continue as i highly prefer content whose only purpose is not to be readable in a few seconds and garner karma . 
  what does that have to do with the topic ? 
  i do n't think such a behaviour is necessarily restricted to germans , it 's more of a thing humans seem to do in general . 
  a comparison to how many are still left would be good . 
  could n't china already be considered one ? 
  their military spendings seem to be nowhere near those of the usa but you should n't forget them either . 
  how would you know , you sch\u00e4\u00dfelle !, 
  the left part means `` speak french '' ( if i remember correctly ) but what does the right part mean ? 
  i do n't know , should i ask someone ? 
  that 's also why i wrote ` distributor ' . 
  the only thing google can do is stop distributing links to these images . 
  in germany we have [ this law ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/recht_am_eigenen_bild ) which i think is very important to allow everyone to have their own privacy on the internet and elsewhere . 
  it basically says that you can decide what happens to pictures taken of you . 
  if mosley did n't know pictures were taken and shared on the internet or was n't willing to share them , then yes i believe the hoster ( or google as a distributor ) should take them down . 
  maybe he went to pakistan to see pakistan , and not to be the `` hardest traveler '' . 
  after all the horrible revelations finally atleast some good news !, 
  while not the norm , there 's definitelly a few `` three generation households '' around here . 
   the moors ( let 's avoid euphemisms ) i could understand the usage of the term `` moor '' ( * if * the wikipedia article is true ) but what purpose does the last part have ? 
  i have no idea what you 're trying to tell me . 
  just because i agree with the punishment to a degree ( again , i do n't know enough background information to have my own , proper opinion about this topic ) , does n't mean i 'd like it in russia ... . 
  and this is exactly why i 'm not a judge : i have no idea * how * to punish them . 
  but if it 's true what you wrote then yes , they should be punished . 
  maybe the riot grrls adressed an important topic and maybe the sentence was too high ( i really do n't know , i never bothered reading too much about this topic ) , but the form of protest they choose was in my opinion wrong and disrespectful . 
  but then again , maybe this was the only way to make the general public aware of the issue they wanted to adress . 
  the sentence alone seems `` okay '' , but shouting it in a church ? 
  it 's just the light . 
  if we could handle nuclear energy better , i 'd be all for it . 
  but examples like tschernobyl and fukushima have shown me that the consequences for a failure are worse than the positive aspects are good . 
  the idea behind the `` energiewende '' is to keep the environmental impact at a minimum . 
  [ fracking on the other hand ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/environmental_impact_of_hydraulic_fracturing ) . 
  my mom still often says things like : `` that 's so expensive !, 
  it 's like 10 d-mark ! '', 
  because 10 d-mark definitelly sounds more expensive than 5 euro does ( atleast to me ) . 
  it 's probably meant to be an infographic which usually are taller than they are wide . 
  i never had any reason to believe british are not european which itself is already a very vague term ( cultural european ? 
  geographic european ? ), 
  simply because the british ( and the people who lived there before them ) have been a significant part of european history and culture for a long time . 
  that 's what some german medias make it look like , i do n't personally believe that 's true , too . 
  `` merkel and her eu are fully responsible for our problems ! '', 
  - that 's an opinion i could imagine some greeks have . 
  i 'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to ask this question . 
  it might be more relevant in subreddits like / r/tor , / r/privacy or / r/freespeech . 
  paul kalkbrenner with `` sky and sand '' , `` aaron '' , `` azure '' or `` train '' or kraftwerk are possibly the most well known german artists in this scene . 
  there 's also the [ technobase.fm-network ] ( http://www.technobase.fm/ ) which livestreams 24/7 electronic music either from a playlist or with a dj . 
  and there used to be the loveparade with almost 2 million visitors but that is no more ... 
  [ loriot - die nudel ( the noodle ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytltsjxmmas ) [ evelyn hamann \\ ( with loriot \\ ) - die inhaltsangabe ( the summary ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zygk3yvuee4 ) [ heinz erhardt - das gewitter ( the thunderstorm ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijvxuuk0poq&amp;list=flodfueoiqpjsiwism55h6va ) [ heinz erhardt - theaterst\u00fcck mit g \\ ( play with g \\ ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gox8v1dzv9k&amp;list=flodfueoiqpjsiwism55h6va ) those are the first which come to mind when i think of german sketches and these are primarily older ones . 
  ca n't speak about the newer ones ( from tv and internet ) simply because i do n't watch them . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1inbga/reurope_30k_survey_the_fun_question_results/ ) is a popular submission from / r/mapporn containing a few maps about the last survey . 
  / u/retard007 did n't really add to the discussion in the first place by submitting a pretty racist and stereotypical comic . 
  i usually do n't downvote people but i guess i might as well give you a reason for my downvote because i personally always hate it when someone downvotes me but does n't say anything . 
  i 'm basing my vote on the two points below which you can also find in the [ redditquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) . 
  * ** make comments that lack content . 
  ** phrases such as `` this '' , `` lol '' , and `` i came here to say this '' are not witty , original , or funny , and do not add anything to the discussion . 
  * ** announce your vote ** [ ... ] . 
  `` upvote '' and `` downvote '' are n't terribly interesting comments and only increase the noise to signal ratio . 
  i think you 're trying to draw a conclusion just because you want to there . 
  your source shows the percentage of people who lack paid work divided by gender and country of birth but not why those groups lack work . 
  maybe they ca n't find work , maybe they do n't want to work . 
  if you want to support your argument you got ta find a better `` source '' . 
  why does everyone always look at these things from an economic perspective ? 
  the way i see it is that sweden is letting these people live there so they can live a better life , so they do n't have to fear for their life ( edit : life , not death ) ( if they come from a politically unstable environment ) . 
  yes , maybe the government also has some other arguments and maybe they are secretly evil , so what ? 
  in my opinion ( ** !!!, 
  ** ) they 're doing something good to those people and that 's all that matters . 
  i 've also heard about programs which create a secret partition somewhere on your drive however i 've no idea how good that 'd work . 
  edit : damn , / u/clit _ commander already mentioned it ... 
  wtf , why would you think that ? 
  seriously ... people these days ... 
  well , the uk is also more developed , bigger and has a lot more citizens so that * might * explain the amount of video cameras . 
  furthermore north korea possibly does n't even need any video cameras . 
  from the documentaries i 've seen many people seem ( maybe they do n't ) to believe everything the government tells them and crime is also almost non-existent . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxrbhzvvsiq ) 's a good example for it , if anyone wants to hear it . 
  and german . 
  theoretically ukraine is a democracy , which is what i hope will succeed in the end . 
  if the citizens decide to stay with russia , go ahead . 
  if they want to join the eu , i 'd be even happier but in the end it 's their choice . 
  why is it germany 's fault ? 
  yes , / r/europe is very pro-eu and sometimes some people tend to downvote others for not agreing with them ( which might have been a reason for the downvotes your first comment here received ) ... however you also act pretty immature . 
  also , reddit is not a huge , homogenous blob which always has the same opinion no matter the circumstances , there 's millions visiting this site so you could expect some diversity . 
  we called the storm xaver . 
  the media made it look like the worst storm ever was approaching and in the end barely anything was destroyed . 
  also , go volvo !, 
  i 've only ever seen german with either russian or turkish ancestors eat \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0438 , my german friends who grew up in a german environment rarely know about it .
