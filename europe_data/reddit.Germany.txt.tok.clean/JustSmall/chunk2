  while they officially all use the same time , the people really do n't care and just use their own time . 
  slight blue = should be +1 hour grey = correct timezone slight red = should be -1 hour dark red = should be -2 hours is that correct ? 
  just look at the header . 
  yeah ... did n't notice that one ...

  your text had a little formatting issue , this one should be easier to read . 
  wait , we ` re n't we trying to intimidate them ? 
  it does n't matter if those questions were actually asked by anyone . 
  the point is , like / u/myuym already said , that the questions she had to face were as unappropriate as the ones she `` invented '' . 
  i never really understood this ( probably also because i never lived in a big city ... ) but is there no way for you to live in a suburb or for example munich and then use public transportation to get into the city at a lower cost than living right there ? 
  i could imagine that it might be annoying having to use the bus or tram all the time but it might be easier to finance . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i think my english abilities largely came from spending a lot of time in english communites , often gaming-centered . 
  for example i used to play trackmania united nation forever which forced me to speak english . 
  i feel like there were 4 different soccer animes but the main character always looked the same ( spiky black hair ) and he was always the brave , successful soccer player so it did n't really matter to me who he is as long as i got to watch it . 
  i was actually born in 1997 but i 'd guess that i did n't have too much new toys because my parents spend their money on different things . 
  but i can relate to a lot things you mentioned like pok\u00e9mon , the gummibears , `` es war einmal ... '' and nfsmw . 
  one piece and tsubasa ( all those soccer animes ) were the only animes i really liked back then , maybe naruto a little bit . 
  the song we used to sing in elementary school was a lot faster ( like a rap almost ) but i think [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxsslcayfrk ) is also pretty good . 
  however the umlaute * \u00e4 * , * \u00f6 * , * \u00fc * and our * \u00df * are usually not mentioned within these songs , or in the alphabet in general , we simply asume everyone knows they exist . 
  have you checked amazon ? 
  last time i saw them they were 5 $ for 100 ( edit : 100 , not 500 ) pieces . 
  * saturday morning , watching tv and waking my sister up once [ tom & jerry ] ( http://www.gestern.tv/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tom-and-jerry.jpg ) starts * watching tv all weekend long * building a fort out of blankets , pillows and couches and playing pok\u00e9mon red in it * during summer break a few of my friends and i met at the playground every morning , and played until midday when we went home , ate and went back to the playground , and we bought [ kratzeis ] ( http://www.kikisweb.de/essenundtrinken/suessspeisen/eis/wasser2.gif ) for 50 cent , kratzeis is just very hard ice with flavour but it sure made fun eating it ; there we always played at one of [ these ] ( http://www.soziologie-etc.com/soz/kind/sp/spielplatz02-5-11j-04-rondelle-etc-d/024-rondell-03-berner-oberland-55pr.jpg ) ; one person stood in the middle and turned the wheel which then made the whole thing turn very fast when done correctly and everyone else attached themselves at the outside , the person who lasted longest won and did n't have to land in the sand ( some people flew a few metres far and sometimes face first into the sand which was hilarious until their mom decided it was too dangerous * we even stole candies at the local kiosk because we did n't have any pocketmoney and it was exciting , in total i probably stole candy worth 20 $ within a few months ; we surprisingly were not caught even though our pockets were visibly stuffed with sweets ( [ these ] ( http://americancandy.de/images/center_shock.jpg ) were out favourites ) i guess this is n't really specific for a `` german '' childhood but i thought it was still worth sharing . 
  there were a few more thing we did in school ( beating eachother up each break for example ... ) but they were not a very big part of my childhood . 
  `` organizations '' and `` regulations '' do n't fit or atleast turn into the wrong direction ( they would press against eachother the way it is presented ) . 
  in monaco and an islandnation in the ne of new zealand ( do n't know which country it is ) . 
  edit : i think it 's samoa but i 'm not sure . 
  hey , you could still downgrade to 12.16 which is the last version in presto ( their former engine ) !, 
  i 've been using it since it 's release now and i 've yet to see a browser which satisfies me more . 
  the only problem i sometimes have is the incompability with certain websites . 
  the new opera with the webkit/blink engine is a big downgrade from both the former presto-based browser and from chrome and safari as it lacks many features which were once a big part of opera ( atleast that was the case last time i tried it ) . 
  so far i 've yet to see a browser with which i 'm more satisfied with than with opera 12.16 which is why i 'm sticking with it for now . 
  edit : words, 
  just because italy no longer considers it a tax heaven does n't mean it no longer is one . 
  there are different numbers in french french and belgian french ... that 's enough to make it a new language , right ? 
  could you tell us why you were disappointed with vienna ? 
  i 'm going there next summer with a few people from school and would like to know more about the city . 
  in germany it is known as both tschechien and tschechische republik , so i guess things wo n't change much for us . 
  i think it 's actually oakhornies . 
  i do n't know too much about german politics ( yet ! ), 
  but i would n't describe them as that extreme . 
  the cdu is center-right , their sister-party csu is slightly right-ier and the spd is center-left . 
  merkel was not the reason for these results , it was obviously the deutschlandkette . 
  that 's the exact opposite of what you 're suppossed to do with your votes . 
  i 've found out a few months ago that if the sea level was to rise about 72 meters the house i currently live in would be exactly at the shore . 
  that 's the reason why i think my parents strategically made me live here . 
  asia 's population would suffer , but europe would lose many parts of its past to the sea like big , old towns like hamburg , london , venice , etc. . 
  except those who would n't like a european federation ( ef ? ), 
  like people who are simply against it , russia , etc. . 
  i 'm fairly small and i 'm certain the only reason behind that is the lack of fruchtzwerge in my early childhood . 
  i 'm currently learning russian in school and it 's a lot of fun once you get used to the cyrillic alphabet which is surprisingly easy . 
  but then again there are words like \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c and you get all `` this is crazy '' . 
  but the german translation sehensw\u00fcrdigkeit probably is n't the best word for someone learning german either . 
  that sounds like some sort of ice cream . 
  that means africa colonized every continent except for antarctica , and then colonized itself afterwards . 
  so far she did what she always does : nothing . 
  there are some generic election posters in most bigger cities but that 's about it . 
  wake me up is also the 1st in the german charts right now but a new song the charts right now is this german rap song by [ casper named `` im ascheregen '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqobmm_qzvq ) . 
  as a german i 'd like to thank portugal for being the country we can use as an example to make us feel better . 
  edit : guys , it 's just a joke !, 
  as you can see in my edit , it was not leibniz but the company bahlsen who introduced them . 
  they however named them after leibniz , leibnizkekse . 
  i got another pseudo-anglicism in german : * kekse - originally refered to cakes but is now used like `` cookies '' ( there are still chocolate chip cookies which we refere to as cookies but kekse is more general ) i think leibniz was the guy who brought `` kekse '' to germany in ~ 1900 . 
  back then he just labelled them `` cakes '' but because few germans could speak english everyone said something like `` kuhkis '' . 
  leibniz was not amused to he started to call his products `` kekse '' instead which is a lot more similiar to the english word . 
  edit : i did some research ( [ ... ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kekse ) ) and it turns out it was not leibniz but bahlsen who brought this word into germany and it used to be written ` keek ( s ) ' in the beginning which then turned into keks .
