  of course , stay away from rtl or pro7 but you should not forget channels like arte and 3sat ( only sometimes ) !, 
  worst : people give you strange looks if you look/behave `` different '' .

  adimit 's comment below describes what i meant to say better . 
  this looks very tasty and i can only think it is pudding . 
  that 's sad . 
  but why are people still willing to give them money if they could easily do a job ( atleast it seems like they could ) ? 
  is n't northrhine-westphalia 's gdp also pretty damn high ? 
  i mean , we are part of the blue banana and the whole ruhrpott is a developed region . 
  hey , they did get both cars into the points this race !, 
  it 's getting better ... hopefully ... 
  maybe i 'm just not digging deep enough into the comments but from what i 've read on here so far people have largely been using the snp 's results as a way to show the downsides of fptp , but no one has been shitting on the party itself . 
  ahem ... you seem to have forgotten three ~ ~ midgets ~ ~ microstates ... 
  as far as i know beijing time is only applied to e.g. 
  train departure and arrival times , during everyday life a more reasonable time is used .

  was n't that subreddit started by someone who was banned in / r/europe for some/all sorts of hatred to begin with ? 
  people are upset that someone reminded them not to downvote based on opinion so they downvote / u/slyratchet for their opinion . 
  they could do it like switzerland and simple not declare an official capital . 
  that might be the case but he was largely not elected democratically and in one way or another responsible for the deaths of 20 million people . 
  putin might not appeal to many people outside of russia , nor are his actions regarding , e.g. 
  the opposition inside russia and without unquestionable , but he was elected through a democratic process . 
  yes , but as / r/europe sees russians as literal barbarians who are not able to act * logically * , the voting process is not democratic and putin is a de-facto dictator .

  just like the aqueduct in magdeburg , it is part of the mittellandkanal , however it crosses the weser instead of the elbe . 
  unsubscribe, 
  you 're are , rightfully so , afraid of liechtenstein . 
  as every sensible nation should be . 
  we did it reddit crisis in the middle east solved, 
  about time . 
  not sure if equal rights for adoption are included as well , but i hope they are . 
  uuhhhh so i guess i 'm ~ ~ accidentally ~ ~ technically correct ? 
  its capital is vaduz , although its most populous town is schaan . 
  their football clubs participate in the swiss league system , with the highest placed club being fc vaduz who were just relegated from the first division . 
  it used to be affiliated with austria , however following wwi it grew closer to switzerland . 
  they do not currently participate at the esc . 
  they rank among the highest in pretty much any list regarding gross income , gdp per capita , quality of life , etc. 
  ; that is if they are accounted for at all . 
  they used to not recognise czechia as an independent country for a long time , as liechtenstein 's royal family used to own land there which was seized by either the czech or the czechoslovak goverment . 
  they possess neither railway infrastructure nor an airport , though i do believe there might be a helipad . 
  liechtenstein does no longer have its own delivery room , so liechtensteiners now have to travel to a nearby swiss hospital . 
  liechtenstein and haiti had identical flags up until their flag bearers met during the olympics in the first half of the 20th century , which led to both of the nations adjusting their flags . 
  they actually call it ` fussball ' in switzerland and liechtenstein . 
  large enough not to be densely populated and huge range of different climates to choose from . 
  my parents never did . 
  my older cousin however , who was ` taught ' this by my mother many years before , tried to scare me by saying that a monster called ` puberty ' hides between the couches and the wall , and if you go there it 'll eat your arm . 
  not sure if it ever worked on me . 
  i 've since told this to other younger relatives to see what their reactions are . 
  few are scared , most think i just talk my usual shit . 
  i know there are a few ruins scattered in the woods , tho i have n't found any ( probably because i have n't searched yet ... ) . 
  i think they were only used to store ammunition in an area that was unlikely to be target of air raids . 
  not sure if there are/were any in the city . 
  [ i asked a similar question some time ago , just not specifically about euros ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6c4pgl/which_words_are_used_to_refer_to_money_in_your/ ) , in case you 're interested . 
  ( i hope this does n't come across as me trying to discredit this thread as repost , just wanted to point to further reading material if interested ! ), 
  the climate just does n't suit motorcycles as much as e.g. 
  southern us does . 
  you can only really ride for a few months each year , you 'd have to have thick skin to ride the other months . 
  thankfully the wolf is slowly returning to more areas . 
  minimal talking . 
  i think you meant to write stettin and breslau . 
  exactly . 
  i heard tel aviv is pretty good tho . 
  how popular or well known is yung lean in sweden ? 
  nah , finland should be part of western mongolia !, 
  late 80 's / early 90 's in west-berlin , so that i would get to experience the closed-off west-berlin , the fall , and the rave scene of the reunified germany . 
  just my personal opinion , but i think you got waaayy too tight of a schedule there . 
  one can easily spend a fulfilling week in any of those destinations . 
  if you try and visit all four of those in a week you 'll spend half or more of your time getting from one place to the other . 
  i 'm madly in love with [ the districts ] ( https://youtu.be/ohfli0zriv0 ) right now . 
  i do n't think the school or the federal state enforces one or the other . 
  some of my english teachers spoke/wrote/taught british english , other focused on american english . 
  most of them allowed us to choose which one to use , but i also do n't think i ever got penalised for mixing both . 
  because i was never taught one over the other i now have to remember to write one particular way , which ended up being bre . 
  my spoken english is most likely all over the place too , sprinkled with a few false friends . 
  ame is seen as the standard english thanks to much of our anglophone media coming from the us , while bre is seen as rather posh . 
  i do n't think people care about it at all , but i 've never had to use english in a professional setting , so who knows . 
  born and raised in germany , but both of my parents moved here from the ussr in the 70s and 80s as kids . 
  both were part of the german minority there , at times living in what is now ukraine , north caucasus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan . 
  lithuanian in germany ? 
  where would one learn that ? 
  the spiciest food i ate so far were the [ blair 's death rain habanero pepper ] ( https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/b003wwjfiq/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=utf8&amp;psc=1 ) , which are apparently about 60.000 scoville , although i have no idea how accurate those numbers are . 
  they brought tears to my eyes , i started sweating , and i could only eat multiple in a row if i dipped them into yogurt ( with garlic , which tasted great by the way ) . 
  i think i could go higher but have n't tried anything spicier so far . 
  been to amsterdam a couple of times now . 
  lots of international concerts , good airport connections , and the city itself is nice too . 
  what 's the air like up there ? 
  * haha haha ha *, 
   skilling - old currency oh , i think there used to be a currency or monetary unit called ` schilling ' somewhere in the german-speaking region too . 
  i think i 've heard it used to refer to ( modern-day ) money before too , now that i think about it . 
  here are the ones i have personally heard or used , although other german-speaking redditors can probably add a whole bunch still : moneten - do n't know of a literal translation , mostly used to describe paper money kies , schotter - gravel moos - moss m\u00e4use - mice zaster - do n't know of a literal translation , used to describe money in general knete - dough kr\u00f6ten - toads lappen - cloth , only paper money kohle - coal piepen - squeak ( as in the sound birds make ) asche - ash bl\u00fcten - blossom ( used to describe counterfeit money ) rubel , taler , groschen , pfennig - foreign or historic currencies, 
  mostly germans , a few from turkey , russia , kazakhstan , spain , greece , as well as two `` republikfl\u00fcchtlinge '' from the east . 
  all of them are german citizens tho so i would n't normally consider them foreigners . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  i 'm not even sure if what i said is in any way true , i might just be talking shit again . 
  i think either albania or georgia . 
  both of them are already fairly close to the eu , and if i 'm not mistaken the only member to vote against an advancement of eu-albania discussions was uk , so that will soon no longer be an `` issue '' . 
  i had to read/pretend to have read `` tauben im gras '' by wolfgang koeppen , `` andorra '' by max frisch , and `` wilhelm tell '' by schiller . 
  i had to look him up and his story does ring a bell , however i 'm not sure if that 's because we covered him in school or whether i had looked him up myself at some point .
