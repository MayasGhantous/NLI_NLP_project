  like i said , i was n't exactly a * mustersch\u00fcler * . 
  i 'm from northrhine-westphalia , and two topics that i can remember are how jews were treated in the time leading up to and including the nazi-era , as well as talking about the german resistance movement . 
  mind you i was n't the most attentive student at the time so i probably already forgot some ... 
  up until 10th grade i could choose between protestant , catholic , or just not taking any class . 
  from 10th grade onwards until the end of school in year 12 i could then decide between protestant , catholic , or now philosophy . 
  other schools might also offer buddhist , orthodox , islamic , and jewish , depending on the demand and available ressources . 
  i should note that during the years where i took protestant classes we did n't only talk about the protestant church , but very often also about ethical , political , or social problems . 
  the nazi-era was covered repeatedly , and we also talked about the us-american civil rights movement . 
  the german netflix does n't have futurama .

  the genre tags may or may not be entirely accurate . 
  pleasure to meet you as well . 
  it 's not exactly good manners to go around telling people they sound insane but whatever . 
  if you read the comment you replied you 'd see that i specifically noted that this is * not * something i 'm proud of . 
  it 's literally the very first passage . 
  the two comments i already wrote in this thread should give you an idea of what my opinion on this topic is so just carefully read them . 
  well , i disagree . 
  of course the energy itself that is produced is super clean compared to most , if not all , other energy sources . 
  however i think the consequences of a nuclear disaster are far too risky and there 's also the question of what to do with the toxic waste that is generated during nuclear fission . 
  now i 'm not saying that germany is a flagship country when it comes to green energy . 
  we still continue to use and [ excavate brown coal ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/tagebau_garzweiler_panorama_2005.jpg ) in gigantic open mines . 
  we literally destroy entire villages in the process , which i think is disgusting . 
  people lose the homes they and many of their ancestors grew up in for the sake of terribly dirty energy . 
  i refuse to be proud of things i did n't have a meaningful impact on . 
  however , there 's a couple of things in germany and in europe that i 'm * fond * of . 
  for example i 'm glad germany discontinued its use of nuclear energy , and i 'm glad many parts of europe have bonded together to form a peaceful union despite often century old feuds . 
  only via the internet . 
  never watch tv and never read physical newspapers . 
  yep , seems like i forgot those . 
  you 're right , i added it in !, 
  most notable positions before becoming chancellor of the post-nazi era : angela merkel - leader of opposition , minister of environment , minister of women and youth , and former research scientiest gerhard schr\u00f6der - prime minister of lower saxony and former lawyer helmut kohl - minister-president of rhineland-palatinate and leader of opposition helmut schmidt - minister of defence , minister of finance . 
  he also gained a reputation as the senator of the interior of hamburg , managing the [ north sea flood of 1962 in hamburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_sea_flood_of_1962 ) willy brandt - governing mayor of west berlin , foreign minister and vice chancellor , fled to norway and sweden to work as leftist journalist during the nazi era kurt georg kiesinger - minister president of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ludwig erhard - vice chancellor , minister of economics , seen as [ father of the german economic miracle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wirtschaftswunder ) , former economic consultant konrad adenauer - mayor of cologne , president of the prussian state council i did n't check but i think most if not all of them were also leader of their respective parties leading up to and often during their tenure as chancellor . 
  european : [ the ikurri\u00f1a ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/flag_of_the_basque_country.svg/2000px-flag_of_the_basque_country.svg.png ) is my favourite . 
  bulgaria , estonia , germany , and iceland also have nice flags . 
  also [ the flag of the most serene republic of venice ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tlhr2gy83wo/ueuqb_t3ewi/aaaaaaaaaua/sq0gaz6rhgy/s1600/venetian_flag.jpg ) and [ the flag of the second spanish republic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/flag_of_spain_%281931_-_1939%29.svg/2000px-flag_of_spain_%281931_-_1939%29.svg.png ) . 
  non-european : [ jamaica 's flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/flag_of_jamaica.svg/2000px-flag_of_jamaica.svg.png ) is my favourite in this category . 
  azerbaijan , bhutan , israel , japan , and sri lanka are nice too . 
  i guess i figured the people of russia were n't too fond of the eu , but i do n't actually know what armenians think of the eu and the possibility of joining it either . 
  politically , russia just seems to be on opposite ends with the eu too , which is not to say that i endorse one or the other . 
  if we were to ignore the political side of this tho , i would welcome russia with open arms . 
  i 've had the fortune of visiting russia and learning about its people , my entire family lived in russia ( well , it 's predecessor states anyways ) for a couple centuries so there are a few `` russian '' things in my life , and there 's a large russian/russian-born population where i life so it 's a natural part of my life . 
  and besides , travelling russia would become considerably cheaper and easier if russia also joined the schengen area , those visas are just so inconvenient ... 
  might want to put / u/xnicolex into the `` still holding out hope '' bracket !, 
  yep , i was n't sure whether to include them or not . 
  arguably there is a strong european influence but the `` democracy '' part seems to be lacking . 
  however , judging by an article about the upcoming elections i read , the same could be said about armenia , so i do n't know really . 
  georgia seems closest to joining the eu tho , i 'm just afraid of the breakaway states and cold conflicts with russia . 
  would n't mind georgia , armenia , cabo verde , canada , australia , new zealand , maybe some caribbean states joining . 
  but that 's just culturally . 
  some of them would first need to improve e.g. 
  in their fight against corruption . 
  by the way , cyprus is n't in europe and already part of the eu . 
  i usually go to joint turkish-russian stores for stuff like pita bread or watermelons , they 're usually the cheapest and tastiest there compared to regular `` german '' stores . 
  i 'll go with moldova . 
  low quality of life and corrupt . 
  i 'll most likely be voting for the party die partei . 
  they are very good . 
  i live in the general area where [ the battle of the teutoburg forest ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_teutoburg_forest ) took place , the decisive battle in which various germanic tribes teamed up to destroy three roman legions and halt roman expansion into germanic territory . 
  i have yet to visit the archaeological site in kalkriese at which ( parts of ) the battle supposedly took place but i definitely want to at some point . 
  traffic lights are usually turned off for the night unless the junction is highly frequented . 
  if i did come upon such a traffic light tho i would probably still wait . 
  the band ` siekiera ' comes to mind . 
  the most memorable one was probably when i was about 10 years , maybe younger , taking a stroll through the woods with my parents and my younger sister , encountering a wild sow with her piglets . 
  they were a good distance away but it was tense nonetheless . 
  other than that i occasionally see hedgehogs , mice , deer ( does ? 
  ) , pheasants , hares , falcons . 
  there have been reports of wolves returning to east-westphalia too , however i have n't personally seen any . 
  there are a lot of white stork breeding grounds around here tho , which is always a beauty to see during the summer , especially when you first see the nestlings ' heads poking out of the nests . 
  i got my driver 's license driving manual , but i absolutely dread it . 
  do n't want to go back if i do n't have to , i 'd rather pay up to get an automatic . 
  i also get the same looks like you when i say that . 
  i do n't share people 's excitement for driving cars , for me it 's a chore . 
  self-driving cars ca n't come fast enough ... 
  let 's settle on giving it to luxembourg then . 
  the return of danelaw perhaps ? 
  [ stefan raab - wadde hadde dudde da ] ( https://youtu.be/pjgszpnj7dy ) as well as [ guildo horn - guildo hat euch lieb ] ( https://youtu.be/hpzx7ezifd0 ) are my two favourites . 
  [ but let 's not forget these russian babushki ] ( https://youtu.be/wknrgc71hjc ) !, 
  french ( i already took it in school for a couple of years but hardly remember any of it ... je ne sais rien de francais , i think ) , spanish , or arabic . 
  they could all help make travelling easier and more fun . 
  but i would also like to learn basque just for the hell of it . 
  reluctantly smile , nod , and chuckle every once in a while . 
  germans based on their clothes . 
  [ russians based on their hairstyle ] ( http://img.aktuell.ru/spzaktuell/images/08-israil.jpg ) . 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  i 've never really hiked before ( ignoring those few walks in the local `` mountains '' ) , but it 's something i will wan na try out sooner or later . 
  if i do end up taking the train ride into central asia tho my main focus would be kyrgyzstan , which seems to have plenty of hiking great opportunities . 
  i definitely want to go to russia at some point , but not during the world cup , because i would imagine the cost of being a tourist goes up with more tourists around , as well as a general hatred towards fifa , uefa , and modern football in general . 
  so yeah , optimally i would visit in 2017 , although i do n't have any set plans . 
  how about a cheeky trans-sib train ride from moscow to either novosibirsk and then down to central asia or to the pacific coast and then on to japan ? 
  i think soviet architecture can be quite comfy , especially during winter and with such a beautiful backdrop . 
  beautiful nature , very rich history , incredibly hospitable and friendly people . 
  there are many people with russian ancestors in my area and i 've been to russia for about 10 days in the past , which was a great experience . 
  i 'm hoping to go back for a vacation soon-ish , preferably before 2018 because i expect the prices to rise with the football world cup . 
  but then there 's a whole lot of shit going on in the politics , some of which is sadly even supported by parts of the general population ( e.g. 
  homophobia ) , which is just sad . 
  it 's sad to see what they 're doing in georgia , in syria , or in ukraine . 
  that 's not say that the respective antagonists in those conflicts are saints tho ... 
  minecraft is ( at the moment anyways ... ) my all-time favourite , although i ca n't stand it anymore after having wasted about 3 years and thousands of hours in it ... at the moment i 'm mostly playing rocket league . 
  recently finished life is strange as well , which i can highly recommend . 
  nope , wanderlust is not sexual .
