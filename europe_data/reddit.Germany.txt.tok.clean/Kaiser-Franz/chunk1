refugees from war zones , not immigrants . 
   ethnic estonians you mean majority of estonians which are a mix of estonians , germans , danes , swedes , finns , russians , latvians ? 
  or the remaining few `` pure '' estonians ? 
  you do realise that various ugro-finnic ethnicities live in russia ? 
  some of them were even involved in establishing the early russian state . 
  how is it good ? 
  because they will get trump off their back , or is there some other better reason ? 
  to use is as a test , to see how cooperative you are . 
  if your pw 's match then all is good . 
  right . 
  how is your geography ? 
  also could you define what is europe politically and culturally, 
  with the deutsche bahn train in the background ... 
  nazi is short for national socialist in german . 
  so it depends which nation . 
  smaller and poorer countries then scotland already are enforcing schengen , so it 's not as big of a deal as you are trying to make of it . 
  and those smaller and poorer countries are neighbouring countries like serbia , russia , etc. 
  where possibility of illegal activities is much greater . 
  they are all stored in you 're device . 
  e.g it is pretty easy to get all your wifi you used together with passwords , time of usage , etc. 
  getting the data is really easy , it 's just not legal . 
  so was 75 % of the world at certain point . 
  my point is that cyprus is geographically in asia . 
  what is yours ? 
  you do n't need to be geographically in europe to be apart of eu . 
  exceptions can be made and cyprus joined under this exceptions . 
  why cyprus ? 
  its not even partly in europe . 
  edit : why the down votes ? 
  the island is geographically in asia . 
  eu members states do n't need to be located in europe to be apart of it . 
  maybe to spread hate against immigrants and muslims , and help right wingers become more mainstream ? 
  well the reality is that they can get most of the pw 's quite easily . 
  this is more like a ** test to see how cooperative you are ** . 
  if your pw 's match then all is good . 
  no , you need 10 germans to engineer a light-bulb that never dies and never brakes so that essentially there is no need for screwing light-bulbs - ever . 
  euro area debt crisis can be described as economic-political crisis . 
  while it was caused by economics , the resolution of it depend on both political and economic factors . 
  ( more ) closed marked , with americans buying more america products made by american workers . 
  in a way they are leaning more torwards the chinese model , which is not particularly open neither . 
  because lng is interesting only if prices of gas are high . 
  kind of similar as shale oil production makes much more sense if prices of oil are high . 
  well i am sure germany would get russian tanks for free it it wanted , it all depends what they would have to do in return . 
  there is a reason nato countries buy stuff from other nato members . 
  there is also a reason why serbia is getting a better deal . 
  many smaller nato countries have no ability to police their own airspace ( effectively ) , and have to outsource it to bigger neighbouring countries . 
  so it 's not that it has to be done , regardless of the cost . 
  more important question is , why does serbia think that it going to get attacked any day soon . 
  something , something , trojan horse ? 
  eurovision is a private company . 
  any ( national ) broadcaster can buy into it . 
  it would most certainly be ** safer ** !, 
  they did total the previous lamborghini they got . 
  he is clearly more interested in being a leader of sunni `` union '' . 
  i do n't think he is going to lose any sleep over europe , if anything he will use it to gain political/popular vote among sunnis . 
  this : [ silesians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silesians ), 
  how good is your czech ? 
  & nbsp ; ^ hint : ^ the ^ czech ^ title . 
   hard to blame them . 
  foreigners coming in to vote in your election by truckload is worse than illegal immigrants . 
  well if it is legal , then they can only blame themselves . 
  it is a bit undemocratic , for them not being allowed to vote .

  & nbsp ; yes self-determination would be debatable if we would be talking about society where majority ( turks ) and minority ( kurds ) have equal rights . 
  i dont think that is the case here . 
   the european court of human rights has condemned turkey for the thousands of human rights abuses . 
  many judgments are related to systematic executions of kurdish civilians , torturing , forced displacements , destroyed villages , arbitrary arrests , murdered and disappeared kurdish journalists , activists and politicians . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_of_kurdish_people_in_turkey ) & nbsp ; but more importantly , turkey even rejects a kurdish state outside its borders in rojava or iraqi kurdistan ( autonomous and already self-governing regions ) , simply because majority will be kurdish . 
  & nbsp ;  `` if europe continues this way , no european in any part of the world can walk safely on the streets . 
  we , as turkey , call on europe to respect human rights and democracy , '' erdogan said at event for local journalists in ankara . 
  & nbsp ; roger gollum , when can we talk about establishing a democratic kurdish state ? 
  low political will to solve social problems imo . 
  well you have any solid evidence for that ? 
  well you have any solid evidence that they came from asia ? 
  neither are all the slavs . 
  at least according to r/feddvergil, 
  he means triest !, 
  interesting . 
  i presume that all ethnic groups that arrived later and lived here for 1500 years should just `` move back '' , right ? 
   turkey is partly in europe m8 . 
  ftfy * geographically * , turkey is partly in europe m8 . 
  so indigenous during the hallstatt period , or even earlier ? 
  what is `` european '' ? 
  [ a slovene while looking at this map ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3xz2bce5jn2j4om9zs/giphy.gif ), 
  i guess you are misread that it * depends on the geopolitical and political situation of a destination country * . 
  & nbsp ;  i ca n't think of a single eu member with hiv and krokodil epidemic as high as russia . 
  every single anti-western point can be countered with `` and you guys are getting infected with hiv '' . 
  & nbsp ; something , something , estonia ? 
  country with the [ highest drug-induced mortality in the eu ] ( https://www.thejournal.ie/estonia-highest-drug-deaths-in-europe-1494188-jun2014/ ) and the [ highest prevalence of hiv/aids in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiv/aids_in_europe ) ? 
  source : [ the mapmaker 's craft : a history of cartography at cia -- cia.gov ] ( https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2016-featured-story-archive/mapmakers-craft.html ), 
  source is eurobarometer pool from 2010 . 
    the current refugee crisis is considered the worst crisis since wwii . 
   by severity of the humanitarian crisis in the home country ? 
  not by a long shot . 
  i look forward to seeing few examples of how syria used to be much worse then eg assad gassing its own people , isis beheading , raping and enslaving people . 
  any examples of medium-to-large deals made between european contractors and the states ? 
   sounds rather cheap to secure that border . 
  well border walls tend to be as effective as cyber security is . 
  if somebody really wants to get in , they will get in .
