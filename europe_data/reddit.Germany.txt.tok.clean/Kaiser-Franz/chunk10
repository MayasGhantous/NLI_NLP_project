  now a question for my fellow estonias , would you feel betrayed if finland would leave you on your own ? 
  would this change your perception of finland ? 
  well its not exactly the same . 
  not sure about you , but i prefer to travel to countries where i dont need to exchange currencies , and feel ripped off every time i buy milk and a loath of bread in local money . 
  not for croatia tho , as its main industry is tourism . 
  i general finns and estonian are quite nationalistic in my experience . 
  they will rather leave and create its own economic & defence union , then to join any federal europe . 
  not sure all want to be apart of the federation , tho . 
  eg i dont see finland & estonia joining . 
   the eu is far too soft on hungary . 
  either they change or they should leave/get kicked out . 
  while any brexit-like referendum would be a disaster for a eu , kicking them out is ok ? 
  just reduce the funding , and start with a stronger eu intergeneration . 
  lets leave hungary isolated with their v4 ( poland ) mates and see how it works out for them . 
  i would be interested to hear what each side ( finns & estonians ) think of this . 
  is it really that radical ? 
  & nbsp ;  estonian defense minister margus tsahkna stated that there is no doubt that estonia will come to finland 's aid if needed . 
  also , this comment made me think of this [ polanbal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wv6p0x4.png ), 
  it is clear that the eu as such will not exist any more . 
  after all uk will be out in 23 months , and the rest of the members are talking about stronger integration . 
  so in 25 years we might end up with a federal republic of europe . 
  we might not . 
  will see \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   i guess estonians are more like finnish than they are like the other baltic states . 
  even when it comes to language , english proficiency and other statistical data you guys more closely resemble finland than latvia/lithuania . 
  til * english proficiency and other statistical data * determines your nationality !, 
  fun fact : finland used to be apart of the baltic countries for most of the time , and was separated and added to nordic only after 2ww - as it was the only baltic country not occupied by russia . 
  you forgot to add this part as well :  the flag was designed in 1955 , and officially launched later that year by the council of europe as ** a symbol for the whole of europe ** . 
   the council of europe urged it to be adopted by other european organisations , and in 1985 the european communities ( ec ) adopted it . 
  why ? 
  ubi of $ 150 all across europe could work . 
  it would work wonders for ee countries that are losing population . 
  se asia is probably still cheaper and more fun . 
   that would basically end turkey-eu relations . 
  in what sense . 
  surly turkey realised long time ago it will never be able to join the eu . 
   the damage cant be that high , right ? 
   i mean , i know agrokor has plenty of healthy and profitable parts ( afaik almost every subsidiary of agrokor in serbia is profitable ) . 
  they are 7 billion in debt , with the whole organisation being worth 3-4 billion . 
  regardless of how `` healthy '' some part are , somebody will have to find those 2-3 billion . 
  if not , then a big part of their suppliers will get ` fucked ' . 
  they used to be a rural status symbols as well . 
  the bigger it was , the wealthier the farm was . 
  also , prominent family members of qatari royal family were kidnapped in iraq in 2015 , and hold hostage only until last month . 
  then qataris flew into baghdad a privet jet carrying 23 bags filled with half a billion dollars ( 500.000.000 usd ) worth of cash . 
   horrible news , qatar is probably the worlds foremost sponsor of terror on a per capita basis . 
  qatar also finances and promotes the extremely barbaric and retrograde wahabi cult , the most brutal and uncivilized form of islam imaginable . 
   qatar was also the largest source of funds to isis , saudi arabia instead favouring the al qaeda linked jahbat al nusra . 
  ... and god forbid europeans would one day try to build in qatar the largest church in the me . 
   triesters are not friulans ftfy triesters are not only friulans, 
  so what is stoping you from getting nuclear ? 
  just like murica is * `` dependant '' * from oil and coal ? 
  good answer , thanks !, 
   in the grand scheme of things , i guess you could look at the events and see its as `` kids walking around and joking '' , but by estonian standards it was a serious upheaval . 
  yes , but it is always much easier to bring under control a bunch of kids and drunks , who dont know what they are doing , then an organised group of hooligans . 
  were there any suggestions that this was planed by certain groups ? 
  thanks for the videos . 
  i can see kids walking around and joking . 
  did this riot actually escalate into something bigger or is this it ? 
  if anything , this is a evidence that although estonian-russians are ethically russian , they are more estonian then russian . 
  how else would you explain his modesty . 
  he went looting - camouflage would explain that he was plaining it - yet all he took is a few snack , a toothpaste , tampons and a sprite . 
  hi did make a point , yet made an effort to not cause to much trouble . 
  \u2044 s serious question tho i suppose there is no evidence that all this people were actually russians , and not only passing opportunists ? 
   how about a pro-austrian sentiment instead ? 
  you know you love us  ja !, 
  estonian logic is that italy is good in fashion because the country is boot shaped . 
  also pizza , piazza , pasta are cool and fun words !, 
  i am sorry for sounding all ` doom and gloom ' , but it seems that we as a western civilisation are fucked . 
  hopefully we can find some proper political solution for this . 
  u/redabenomar ... and all those 150 million had to do is ** nothing ** , for those 22 to get away with it . 
  russian mindset is different , compared to the one in w europe , so it 's really not as simple as it seams . 
  putin is still a cunt imo . 
  considering that it 's counties of ireland , should n't londonderry be just derry ? 
  or is this too much go into politics ? 
  better question , why is syria in europe ? 
  it really is n't . 
  finland used to be apart of the baltic group , prior to ii . 
  but the after the war it was put in the same group with sweden , norway , etc. 
  as it had more in common with them , then eg soviet union . 
  not sure if you forgot the \u2044 s what is funny is that if he burned the whole bible - old and new testament - then he kinda burned talmud as well , which is his bible . 
   they dumped a huge folder a week before , expecting the already overworked anti terrorism services to be able to find the needle in the haystack if you think that intel data is analysed by one guy sitting at the table , by reading them and making notes - then you are wrong . 
  most of agencies have ai that does that for them . 
  the problem is normally that there are too many potential terrorists . 
  you cant really do too much before they actually do something , and once they are in the truck its already to late . 
  imo it is misleading to judge brexit at this pont , when uk is still de facto member of eu . 
  we can only have a realistic view once uk is completely out for a few years . 
  until then all this is only talk . 
  we do n't know for certain that dutch did n't know anything . 
  all they had to do is nothing , which is not exactly the same as testing the cars rigorously and finding nothing . 
  yes they can . 
  indeed west bank is no dubai , but it is no syria either . 
  such a shame they are living in the netherlands . 
  if only they could somehow live in the promised land that is golum 's turkey . 
  and there is no direct link between anis amri and germany ? 
  germany needs to take responsibility now !, 
   indeed , israel needs to take some responsibility for brutalizing the innocent and defenceless palestinian population . 
  this would never have happened if it were not for israel 's policy against the palestinians . . 
  so when will england take responsibility for the recent london stabbing ? 
  when will sweden and germany take responsibility for the recent truck rampage in stockholm and berlin ?
