  they will only need to dedicate more resources to be successful . 
  religious * and political * symbols in general . 
  on top of that , it should also be noted that ** us defense contractors benefit the most from nato ** . 
    because the protesters did n't comply , the police recorded them on video . 
   that will teach them !!, 
  it normally works pretty well on the autobahn, 
   a lot of things are still not as established as in places that have had a longer period of stability . 
  i do n't think that relative `` youth '' of the system has much to do with it being neo-liberal . 
  slovenia is also 25 and has ( had ? ), 
  one of the most social ( 24 % of gdp ) welfare systems in the eastern europe . 
  us on the other hand is 241 years old and they have pretty poor unions , social security . 
  `` fixing your country '' is not exactly the same as when your mom tells you to `` go and clean your room '' . 
  it sounds a bit ignorant to say the least . 
   i am a german entrepreneur and let me tell you : it fucking sucks . 
  well on the other hand estonia does n't really have any worker unions , social security is non-existent and pensions are pretty miserable . 
  imo there is basically a huge amount of population ( pensioners , disabled , etc. ), 
  that is paying the price of this `` entrepreneurial '' freedom . 
  but its not only that , for example if you ** own ** a company you get zero ( 0 ) unemployment money . 
  it does n't matter if the company doesent make any money . 
  you can be fully employed somewhere else , and have you company as a side project . 
  you have to close your company and wait for two years and only then you can hope to get some unemployment money . 
  with regards to the loans , while it is much easier to get loans in general , as a business or non-business owner , it is impossible to get a privet loan as a business owner - as you are paying yourself your own salary . 
  on the other hand people who receive minimum salary ( 400 eur ) are able to get loans for houses without any issues whatsoever . 
  i even know people who got a 20 year loan for an apartment without any work contract . 
  they were being payed in cash 500-600 eur for the last 2-3 years and that was good enough , as long there was money coming regularly to the account . 
  imo its a bit odd , if not to say irresponsible . 
  there are advantages and disadvantages everywhere . 
  whats with this americanization lately ?!, 
  soccer is being used more and more in europe lately , no idea why !, 
   if they turn out to be the only honest car manufacturer in europe i 'll buy a 500 . 
  [ epa accuses fiat chrysler of excess diesel emissions ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiatchrysler-emissions-iduskbn14w29s ),

  in a way this type of comments are similar to the budget/refugee/etc comments made in favor of brexit . 
  you simply do not know what will happen once there is a referendum on eu - which will happen only 2-3 years after the independence . 
  by then we there might be some new euro/refugee/etc crisis , which might drive people one way or another . 
  and making this promise that if scotland gets independent it will join the eu for certain , can leave many people very despondent if that does not happen . 
  i agree that at this point it seem unlikely , but there are many if 's before there will be an actual eu referendum . 
  what else do you expect from the company that sells furniture that customers then have to put together themselves !? 
  i am surprised that the drivers are not paying to ikea , as they are living in the lorry . 
   an independent scotland would * almost certainly * join the eu the only thing that ** is certain ** is that without the scottish independence , there will be no eu referendum . 
  imo implying that the vote for independent scotland is a vote for eu is misleading . 
  all i can see is & nbsp ;  still in the top spot , vienna & nbsp ;  prague is the highest ranking city in central and eastern europe , followed by ljubljana and budapest . 
  & nbsp ; the soviets ( and others ) tried to mess us up , but a-h still stronk !, 
   that 's unlikely and needlessly complicated : this would mean that scotland would have to adjust from an eu system to a brexit system and then back to an eu system . 
  would n't the fact that it is ( was , when it rejoins ) already a member of eu system , make it faster ? 
  certain standards and regulations are already in use . 
  sure setting a new `` brexit '' system will take time , but each time they switch it does n't mean that they format and forget the whole system they used prior to the new one . 
  imo the question is not the time needed to adjust to each system , but rather how long it will take scotland to set up its basic system once ( if ) it becomes independent , as that is something that needs to be done prior to the eu full membership . 
  its not that wearing religious clothes is now banned . 
  employers are simply able to fire/move somebody because of it . 
  if i work in the service industry , dealing with customers face-to-face i would be surprised if i would be able to keep my job if one day i come to work with a huge face tattoo . 
  that might work ok if i work i tattoo shop , but not so well if im selling insurance to pensioners in tirol . 
   why do n't the unionist just mass migrate back to the uk where they come from while ireland reunite , a bit like india / pakistan back in the days ? 
  is n't the catholic population growing faster anyway ? 
  they might becoming a clear minority regardless if they stay . 
   they will most likely have to decimate their agriculture industry . 
  agriculture will also be most effected due to the lack of cheap e.european labor . 
  anybody in uk agriculture should pay close attention and have plans ready if things turn for worse . 
   i do n't know where they 're at , but i know there is a plan proposed to put a gas pipeline through the sea to greece and completely cut turkey out of the deal . 
  the `` south stream '' is dead . 
  it happened quite soon after eu sanctions were put up . 
  for the lazy & nbsp ;  trump and defense secretary mattis are putting unprecedented pressure on european nato members to boost military spending , threatening to reduce america 's support for the alliance if it is not forthcoming . 
  & nbsp ;  one major political barrier to increasing such spending is imposed by the eu itself , which maintains a legal limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gdp . 
  & nbsp ;  10 of the 21 eu nato members would have broken the 3 percent deficit limit had they raised defense spending to the 2 percent nato target in 2016 -- as opposed to just three members at actual 2016 spending levels . 
  & nbsp ;  it is clear that trump 's demands for more eu defense spending and the commission 's demands for spending restraint are , at least in the short term , incompatible . 
   a new pipeline route is good for russia . 
  it allow to bypass those ex-ussr republic that are bothering them ever heard of '' [ nord-stream ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream ) '' ? 
  it does exactly that , bypass the ex-ussr countries , going directly to germany . 
   and pretty much make turkey russia 's bitch . 
  you are talking nonsense . 
   they do because turkey want to become a main hub for gaz and oil going to europe . 
  russia wants turkey to become a main hub for russian gaz and oil going to europe . 
  but only if there are sanctions on oil & gas . 
  if there are no sanctions , then why would they send it true turkey , when thy can ship it directly via nord-stream , poland or ukraine ? 
  & nbsp ;  erdogan want turkey to live as renters , plus being an exporter of oil will allow him to backmail the eu even more . 
  why would russia give away its power to blackmail europe and give it to turkey ? 
   it 's a joke to think that we ever actually considered having turkey in the eu , but i 'm actually glad turkey and its people have been showing their true faces lately . 
  turkey was willing to join , but lets face it europe was never really willing to accept a ( big ) muslim country , regardless of how secular it was . 
  so erdogan used this and instead of europe , he changed focus towards turkey becoming the leader of sunni 's . 
  that 's why all the anti-west drama , anti-secularism , authoritarianism , syria intervention , etc. 
  as it makes saudi arabia look passive . 
   if you go to many places around the world , they still hold these conservative values - even if you go to the west coast of mid jutland fx . 
  imo the diffidence between the secular west and other more traditional countries is that is mostly just words . 
  many say that woman should not walk around `` naked '' and have to cover themselves , but then those same people watch as much ( or even more ) porn as an average westerner . 
  most of it falls into the same category of `` keeping traditions '' imo, 
  more events in germany are planed for the 19th . 
  * [ full list of upcoming events ] ( http://pulseofeurope.eu/poe-staedte/ ), 
  hard to say that they are buddies . 
  they just have many common interest , and both are economically not powerful enough to confront each other . 
  but on the long term turkey does n't necessarily need russia ( except for recurses ) , as their main objective is to become the leader of the sunni world . 
  if anything its russia who needs turkey , as if eu&us sanctions continue and are even extended to selling oil & gas , than having pipeline with turkey might end op being very useful . 
  that is why you also have all this theater , as it makes them look like they are fighting the west . 
   i would say that 80 % of the members of the church could n't care less about religion - we just want our traditions like church marriage , confirmation , christening and all that . 
  with that logic 90 % of the world is not religions .
