  they just want keep their traditions like bar/bat mitvas , christenings , etc. 
  here you go .

  where are the * so-called * experts when you need them . 
  is n't english proficiency in slovenia like the highest ( or close to it ) in eu ? 
  or do i remember that wrong ? 
  similar with estonia i suppose . 
  it would make sense to leave it out , as we dont want the avg . 
  to be too high with all this brexit happening . 
  a bit ignorant to say that . 
  i guess you are forgetting that ** politics \u2260 geography ** . 
  they are definitely more european then cyprus is ( geography ) . 
  what would be the eu and shengen average ? 
  is there any data on that ? 
  the only question is , what foes he mean as uk ? 
  independent scotland , england & wales or both ? 
   i do n't know why he calls himself a swabian , he was n't even born in germany . 
  and swabian people are like a super specific people with roots to the germanic region of the same name . 
  good for him that he assimilated but he seems a bit obnoxious . 
  identity is not exactly a static thing - meaning , that you are born into it and then that 's it . 
  it is much more fluid and if anything it is more related to your actions . 
  he most probably has more things in common with an average german , then with an average turk . 
  based on your logic , he would neither be german nor a turk . 
  that makes little sense . 
  til poland is a balkan country !, 
   state property was privatized , most of it was sold to a very small amount of influential people for ridiculously cheap prices . 
  most of it was not sold per se - more like stolen - as it was used as a collateral for loans . 
  yeltsin needed to borrow money as economy was sinking , and some local `` business man '' were very willing to help . 
  of cousrs under the condition that if goverment is not able to pay , then they can take over certain companies . 
  companies were so severely undervalued that those `` business man '' did n't even bother about the loans . 
  lol you funny bastard !, 
   we manage on our very own that is exactly the first rule of the balkan politics !, 
  its for the tourists . 
  locals not so much . 
  it is funny how many finns & estonians see weed as some evil hard drug . 
  whenever i smoked it with them , they made me feel like im sniffing coke or something . 
  it took all the pleasure away . 
  but then on the other hand , heavily drunk people in the middle of the day are completely ok . 
  til poland is a balkan country !, 
  they used multiple sources . 
  research seems to be quite extensive , and you can find all data [ here ] ( http://www.projectknow.com/discover/high-school-drug-use/ ), 
  there are multiple sources , most are from 2012-14 . 
  if you want to pe exact then you can find all data [ here ] ( http://www.projectknow.com/discover/high-school-drug-use/ ), 
  well estonia , latvia and lithuania have a prohibition of alcohol consumption in public places afaik . 
  which is a bit odd imo . 
  i 'm a simple redditor , i check italy and decide to ignore it , as * everybody * knows that that number is not real . 
  than i see \u00d6sterreich being better than germany i upvote . 
   what are you talking about ? 
  very few countries in eastern europe have anyone close to power with any ties to communism ... 
  i see you have n't heard of [ ku\u010dan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milan_ku%c4%8dan ) yet . 
  he is the top capo of the communist mafia , responsible for everything that is going wrong in slovenia and worldwide . 
  he is everywhere , also in your country . 
  at least according to some people . 
  [ must be this ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6zszhmdksvufimao/giphy.gif ), 
  while venezia is great , i think that some tourists are missing out by focusing only on the city itself . 
  & nbsp ;  clothes and shoes were imported through the uk at fictitiously low values for years to avoid duties , the european anti-fraud office ( olaf ) has found . 
   as a result , investigators say the eu budget has lost millions of pounds in customs duties . 
  & nbsp ;  the olaf investigation found the uk to be a `` significant hub '' for so-called undervaluation fraud - where importers can profit from evading customs duties and related taxes . 
   they say the fraud has cost the eu $ 2.0 bn in lost duties between 2013-16 and now they want the european commission to recover the money from the uk . 
  & nbsp ;  only in 2016 , 79.2 % of the $ 817.2 m losses in customs duties for the eu budget were through uk importation . 
   a spokesman said : `` olaf has repeatedly drawn the attention of the uk customs authorities ( hmrc ) over the last years to the scale of the phenomenon and to the on-going revenue losses . 
   `` as far as olaf is aware , the uk authorities have not introduced risk profiles and the measures that they have taken do not appear to have curbed this traffic . 
   `` to date , they have not initiated any criminal investigations in relation to these frauds . '', 
   nope because a state is not a country . 
  they lose part of their sovereignty because they are in a nation . 
  nein , they certainly are not !, 
  & nbsp ;  for the love of god , can the eu please go back to being an economic union and not an all-encompassing political , bullying monster ? 
  & nbsp ; ** i agree 100 % . 
  ** we should let italy & greece get millions of refugees and make them continue contributing to the eu ( we do n't want eastern europe to run out of all that sweet eu moneys ) . 
  then once italy & greece completely fall apart as counties , the rest of europe can use that to feel really good about themselves - as how the majestic polish , lithuanian , english , hungarian , etc. 
  empires manged to outlive legendary italy and greece . 
  a clear win-win !, 
  i guess you are forgetting that germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states . 
  does each state get to say on each matter as well ? 
  why not doing 2-3 scenarios at once ? 
  it would make make sense to finance the scenario 1 subsidies , with the import tax from scenario 3 . 
   read : sea and sunshine aha that raises a very good question !, 
  where do you store all that sea & sunshine during the winter time ? 
   irrelevant personal opinion impossible to verify then , that 's what i thought . 
  yes its irrelevant , as it does n't fit your opinion . 
   and you blatantly ignored the rest of my reply , which is quite dishonest of you : yes its very dishonest of me . 
  hope you 'll manege to recover from it . 
  unfortunately i do n't have time to prove you that my opinion is the correct one . 
  i shared with you my opinion which is based on real-life experience , not news articles . 
  you can do with that whatever you want . 
  sorry u/kingofnostyle had to update the map https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5y0oj6/europe_bad_health_years/, 
  the average human being is living longer than ever before . 
  nearly every country on the planet has seen an increase in life expectancy since the beginning of the 21st century . 
  but though we are living longer , not all of us are living healthier . 
  health adjusted life expectancy ( hale ) , or healthy life expectancy , is a metric used by the world health organization to measure the number of years a person can expect to live in good health , taking social and economic factors into account alongside disease and disability rates . 
  [ here you can find the full infographic ] ( https://www.medigo.com/blog/app/uploads/2017/03/badhealthyearsmedigo.png ) , which takes a country-by-country look at the change in bad health years since 2000 to see where people are living a longer , healthier life . 
   how many did you survey ? 
  show me your extensive research on this please . 
  i myself lived in israel for many years and have many friends who moved to israel from france . 
  also your list contains solders . 
   we 're talking about french jews moving to israel . 
  so coming back to france , where they were born and spent their life before moving to israel . 
  is it that complicated ? 
  so israel should just assume that all people return to their country of birth once they leave israel ? 
  yes it must be quite difficult adapting to a `` very orthodox '' israeli society .
