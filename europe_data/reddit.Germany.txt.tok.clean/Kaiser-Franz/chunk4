  [ example of very orthodox israeli # 1 ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/13/article-0-140a8b58000005dc-592_634x827.jpg ) [ example of very orthodox israeli # 2 ] ( https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?ref=https%3a%2f%2fcoupleofmen.com%2f3608-sexy-photos-tel-aviv-gay-pride-parade-2016%2f&amp;ua=tw96awxsys81ljagkfgxmtsgvtsgtgludxggaty4njsgzw4tvvm7ihj2ojeuos4xljcpiedly2tvlziwmdkxmjixiezpcmvmb3gvnteuma&amp;uadata=215954614f5758dc7a6afddb9fa1c156&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fi0.wp.com%2fcoupleofmen.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f12%2ftel-aviv-pride-parade-israel-00.jpg%3ffit%3d2000%2c1330%26ssl%3d1&amp;sp=b3598d2fbe235eba1ddccd7ee8ba8dfc&amp;f=6eb2efdf0af9c379cf06fe1f15eb9b86.jpg ), 
   well , france still remains safer than isra\u00ebl you are talking nonsense . 
  if you ask a regular french israeli they will say that they feel much safer in israel . 
   curiously , one thing israel does n't display is the number of jews who come back from israel . 
  well where are they `` coming back '' to ? 
  how can israel keep record of where is ex-residents moved to ? 
  but yes , they are also moving back to europe , mostly due to economical reasons ( high cost of living ) . 
   gypsies and money are a funny combination . 
  they rarely do any legal work , mostly just some schemes . 
  you are a bit over stereotyping here imo . 
  i get your point , but not all roma grups are the same . 
  you could make similar claim for the youths of spain or greece . 
   and when they have money they buy cars , jewellery , and fancy clothes . 
  but their houses look like they are about to collapse . 
  that could be said for any rural area . 
  including estonians living in soviet block houses in the middle of nowhere , but driving bmws . 
  well they can always join if they wan to , no ? 
  with regard to yugoslavia one important factor is that sport culture is/was very present . 
  if anything the yugoslav identity was build on sport . 
  and adidas was one of the brands with the best quality on the market at the time . 
  & nbsp ; ** immigration ** from the arab/africa is one factor . 
  while the situation in france and belgium for the last 10 years made many everyday people worried , it was kinda tolerated - simply many jewish organizations preferred to work on the long term , trying to solve the problem rather then to just play the victim game . 
  hoping that eventual things will get better . 
  & nbsp ; another big factor is the ** lack of action ** from the governments ( or the general public ) once things started to go worse for the jewish minorities since approx . 
  there were many deadly attacks on jewish individuals and organizations ( france , belgium , italy ) prior to 2015 charlie hebdo & paris attack . 
  [ bataclan itself was targeted ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z1dikgo4fg ) many times prior to the attacks - as it has jewish owners - yet nobody was concerned enough to prevent future events and was shocked when it was n't only jews that were getting effected/targeted . 
  things were getting out of control - yet the government started to respond strongly only after the attacks were directed towards the general public and the `` european values '' . 
  that made jewish today in france/belgum feel that they are not really apart of the society , as the general public is not really interested in their ( security ) problems - something which they were pointing out for many years . 
  & nbsp ; sure things have improved since the paris attacked , but that still leaves a bad taste and with the right-wingers on the rise in europe , future seem to be uncertain . 
  on thing is certain , [ latvian potato * par excellence * ] ( https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http%3a%2f%2ft0.gstatic.com%2fimages%3fq%3dtbn%3aand9gcqfyn2u_ioh00tqjp_p5e_87dnpnepifi0hbhx1cb9tiu4nks7xoa&amp;sp=f5a2d574b5da6c02b668197e990c6736&amp;anticache=857072 ), 
  sure they did . 
  they were obvusly sided with serbia . 
  you expected them to start a wwiii due to yugoslav civil war ( s ) or what exactly ? 
   reich so you will be under german influence , that would be the 4th reich then . 
   my family was annoying me to no end with their opposition to selling the port of koper to the chinese some infrastructure is strategically just too important . 
  while state owned companies are causing a lot of frustration in the general public , considering all what happens things are going well . 
  port of koper is now the biggest port in adriatic , tranfering 4-5x more then the legendary trieste . 
  state being involved in ownership is not bad per se - just look at vw ownership , where lower saxony has 20 % voting rights . 
  the problem is the political culture . 
  selling things has its own downside as well , especially to the chinese . 
  port of piraeus is a `` good '' example here . 
  well they did start the i. ww because of them . 
  would n't call that nothing . 
  now why did i write 11 . . thanks for correcting . 
  well it not germany per se , its the [ blue banana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ), 
  still having your doubts i see . 
  but on a serious note , you are correct . 
  did n't want to edit the title too much . 
  there are also articles by [ euronews ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2017/03/03/eu-s-mogherini-booed-by-pro-russian-serbian-mps ) , reuters where its says that she was `` booed '' , which is not exactly correct either . 
  so i guessed people can get their own opinion with a video . 
  i am not saying that serbia is a trojan horse of europe . 
  i would never do that . 
  but that 's what many people are saying . 
  theoretically you dont need much to have a synagogue - only need a tora scroll . 
  what you also need is ~ ~ 11 ~ ~ 10 man . 
  that might be a problem in montenegro . 
   have had encounters with finnish it sector . 
  do n't tell anyone , but ... they suck are cant be serious ? 
  their gaming industry is one of the best - if not the best - in the world . 
  its not all doom and gloom . 
  yes , there is no clear story/vision behind the leadership . 
  but one reason why lithuania ( and latvia maybe ) is able to grow faster then estonia is also that its closer to poland and other mainland europe - which is the economical engine of europe . 
  currently estonia is too focused on finland and sweden ( 1/3 of all exports ) , which are nice and rich markets , but combined are only 15mil people strong . 
  so you would have to diversify your focus also on other ( bigger ) exports marketers within the eu ( germany , france , benelux , italy ) . 
  on top of that improving infrastructure ( tunnel , train ) to increase trade between finland and the baltics would benefit all involved countries as well . 
  sure you do , your on reddit . 
  go and try to have a proper relationship with an beautiful argentinian , italian , israeli and estonian . 
  then come back and we can compare notes . 
  btw im not saying its bad , just everybody has its own preferences . 
  lol nope . 
  no problem in that regard . 
  do n't hold your breath . 
  while they are tall and skinny , estonian women are also quite dull . 
  generally speaking that is . 
   those seem to be common to alpine regions in general ( excepting france and italy , i guess ) . 
  ftfy those seem to be common to alpine regions under the german influence . 
  we have some bad * yanks * and we 're going to get them out, 
  there is difference in the fact that `` low skill '' jobs in germany are mostly preformed by foreigners anyway . 
  these maps show , that in absolute numbers the largest number of british migrants in other eu countries live in spain ( 309,000 ) , followed by ireland ( 255,000 ) , france ( 185,000 ) , germany ( 103,000 ) and italy ( 65,000 ) . 
  on the other side , polish citizens are the largest migrant group from the eu living in the uk ( approximately 916,000 ) , followed by irish ( 332,000 ) , romanian ( 233,000 ) , portugese ( 219,000 ) and italian ( 192,000 ) citizens . 
  looking at the migration flows between the uk and individual eu countries in relative terms , luxembourg , cyprus , spain , france and belgium are those countries that take significantly larger shares of uk citizen that those who move from there to the uk , while on the other end the uk is more attractive for citizen from latvia , romania , lithuania , estonia and poland than it is for uk citizens who moved there . 
   you ca n't draw this conclusion without more data . 
  it 's like saying trump 's victory is proof that americans love putin not exactly related to the subject , but apparently putin is now seen favourable by 30 % of republicans . 
  prior to elections it was close to 0 %, 
  i think he is referring to ottomans ( aka muslims ), 
  as you are mentioning estonian , there is an error for greece . 
  it would be odd to call cyprus and greece by the same name `` k\u00fcpros '' . 
  u/speedlv the real name for greece is `` kreeka '' . 
  most probable source of word `` venemaa '' is the german word '' [ wends ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wends ) '' , which is how the germans called slavs living in the eastern part of the holy roman empire . 
  well that is debatable . 
   could also be something about boats , as vene is boat in archaic estonian / modern finnish . 
  that would be funny considering that russia had basically no maritime culture prior to 1695 , when peter the great began building its navy . 
  he wants to be ridiculed ? 
  already published here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5x56uh/eight_iraqi_men_found_guilty_of_gang_raping/, 
  yes , i stand corrected . 
  still , after they serve the sentence they should still be declared `` persona non grata '' for life . 
   `` come and rape , the worst thing that can happen to you is , that we will send you back to your country . '', 
  or the the alternative is * come and rape , the worst thing that can happen to you is , that you 'll get to stay in europe but we 'll put you into prison for a few years . 
  there you will be able to get connected with other people with criminal records , so that once you are out , they will be able to provide you with some more `` work '' .
