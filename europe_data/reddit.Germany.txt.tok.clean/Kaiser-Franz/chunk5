   lock 'em up , and after that kick 'em out . 
  that sounds a bit harsh . 
  and locking them up is also costly . 
  simply anybody found guilty of heavy crimes should be for life declared * `` persona non grata '' * in the eu . 
  if they are caught re-entering the eu again , then you simply send them to '' [ amsterdam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%8ele_amsterdam ) '' . 
   do n't get me wrong , i know they hack , just like the cia and the chinese do . 
  and uk as well probably . 
  everyone does actually . 
  yes , but it sees to me that you think that hacking itself can be done relatively easy , and is done all the time , by anybody . 
  one is to hack , as brake the passwords , another thing is to analyze collected data and use that data in an optimal matter so that it will be most effective . 
  all that requires many reasons and is not just one guy sitting in the office who does it . 
  the point is that you are not using all the installed capacity - only 95mw from 375mw installed . 
  that would imply that it works 100 % all the time . 
  currently estonia utilities only 25 % ( 95mw from 375mw ) of its installed wind capacity . 
  because all of this is just talk , as usual . 
  like this :  estonia has already met its eu target of 25 % renewable energy by 2020 , and it exports surplus renewable energy to its neighbors . 
  having a capacity to hypothetically produce 25 % energy from renewables make little sense if you dont/cant actuality do it ( you actually only do 6 % ) . 
  especially when you are producing 80-90 % of electricity with the most polluting method - shale oil . 
  at this point 84 % of electricity in estonia comes from shale oil , the rest is biomass ( 6 % ) , wind ( 6 % ) and gas ( 4 % ) . 
  total gross electricity generation in 2015 was 10,417 gwh . 
  that would mean that this wind farm will have to generate 8,334 gwh in a year . 
  how did you end up with 80 % u/h2ppyme, 
  in the other news [ oecd tells estonia it must reduce dependence on oil shale ] ( http://news.err.ee/243859 ), 
   except it is n't a universal income , it 's changed its name for those in the trial , where their unemployment benefit will continue to be paid regardless of if they find work . 
  it is a bit odd to argue that early cars were not cars , simply because they dint teleport you to your preferred location in an instance . 
  it takes time do develop models that work . 
  in the process many trials will fail , which doese not mean that the idea itself is imposible . 
  as such any kind of income that is labeled as `` universal '' and/or `` basic '' will be debatable , as - first : `` universal '' would mean global and not regional , state level , etc. 
  - second : what is `` basic '' ? 
  what should it cover ? 
  food , shelter , maybe also internet ? 
  what about education ? 
  education for how long ? 
  healthcare ? 
  full healthcare also for smokers ? 
  ect . 
  there are many questions to be answered , i am happy to see that this first attempt at least exists . 
  hopefully there will be more in the future . 
  my point is that it that we should not ( only ) point fingers towards russia . 
  as it will be difficult to find any clear evidance anyway , but rather focuse on the root of the problem which imo is ai . 
  & nbsp ;  you realise that there is zero evidence of russia trying to influence the outcome of the eu referendum in the uk , right ? 
  stop lumping this shit together , it 's lazy , wrong , and undermines your point . 
  zero is hard to say , as it depends how you define `` influence '' . 
  we are not imply hacking and virtual means , but putin has more than just an army of hackers at his disposal . 
  also apparently they contributed some money into the brexit campaign . 
  but it will be always difficult to find clear evidence for this . 
  which brings me to the point of my comment i mentioned earlier . 
  & nbsp ; here is something to contradict your opinion maybe . 
  * [ uk officials now think russia may have interfered with the brexit vote ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/labour-mp-ben-bradshaw-suspicious-russian-interference-brexit-2017-2 ) * [ labour mp claims it 's ` highly probable ' russia interfered with brexit referendum ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/russian-interference-brexit-highly-probable-referendum-hacking-putin-a7472706.html ), 
   about russian attempts to influence the outcome though targeted disinformation and propaganda , as they appeared to do in the u.s. presidential election . 
  it 's a bit unfair to say that it was only russians who were attempting to influence the outcome in us/uk , when it is obvious that there are ( also ) individuals/companies based in us/uk that played the same game . 
  there are maybe even some from out of us/uk . 
  education does play a big role , yes . 
  but one additional advantage that finland has is the language . 
  there is a reason why trump/brexit happened in 2 english speaking countries . 
  maybe in the future ai will be able to learn and preform equally good in other languages , as it does in english . 
  but it 's early days now , and some human interference is still required . 
  geographically approx . 
  1/2 of slovenia is in the balkans . 
  at least we can be certain that united kingdom wont fall apart -- losing scotland or/and n. ireland . 
  i am struggling to get your point . 
  but what i believe is junckers point is that if you want all to be in the same-speed eu then you will have to sign up for scenario 5 ( or at least scenario 4 ) . 
  & nbsp ;  here i am , average denizen of the internet , getting curious as to which states are these & nbsp ; you ok mate ? 
  its all written in hypothetical manner so that you can easily understand this 5 scenarios . 
  there is even a sentence in the copied text suggesting that . 
  i guess there is no help for some people ... & nbsp ;  the scenarios cover a range of possibilities and ** are illustrative in nature ** . 
  ** its explained [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wyei8/juncker_presents_5_scenarios_for_how_the_eu_could/ ) . 
  ** he presented 5 options on the eu 's future to the european parliament in brussels , and that was just one of them . 
  the white paper sets out five scenarios , each offering a glimpse into the potential state of the union by 2025 depending on the choices europe will make ( see annex ) . 
  the scenarios cover a range of possibilities and are illustrative in nature . 
  they are neither mutually exclusive , nor exhaustive . 
  & nbsp ; ** scenario 1 : carrying on ** - the eu27 focuses on delivering its positive reform agenda in the spirit of the commission 's new start for europe from 2014 and of the bratislava declaration agreed by all 27 member states in 2016 . 
  by 2025 this could mean : * europeans can drive automated and connected cars but can encounter problems when crossing borders as some legal and technical obstacles persist . 
  * europeans mostly travel across borders without having to stop for checks . 
  reinforced security controls mean having to arrive at airports and train stations well in advance of departure . 
  & nbsp ; ** scenario 2 : nothing but the single market ** -- the eu27 is gradually re-centred on the single market as the 27 member states are not able to find common ground on an increasing number of policy areas . 
  by 2025 this could mean : * crossing borders for business or tourism becomes difficult due to regular checks . 
  finding a job abroad is harder and the transfer of pension rights to another country not guaranteed . 
  those falling ill abroad face expensive medical bills . 
  * europeans are reluctant to use connected cars due to the absence of eu-wide rules and technical standards . 
  & nbsp ; ** scenario 3 : those who want more do more ** -- the eu27 proceeds as today but allows willing member states to do more together in specific areas such as defence , internal security or social matters . 
  one or several `` coalitions of the willing '' emerge . 
  by 2025 this could mean that : * 15 member states set up a police and magistrates corps to tackle cross-border criminal activities . 
  security information is immediately exchanged as national databases are fully interconnected . 
  * connected cars are used widely in 12 member states which have agreed to harmonise their liability rules and technical standards . 
  & nbsp ; ** scenario 4 : doing less more efficiently ** - the eu27 focuses on delivering more and faster in selected policy areas , while doing less where it is perceived not to have an added value . 
  attention and limited resources are focused on selected policy areas . 
  by 2025 this could mean * a european telecoms authority will have the power to free up frequencies for cross-border communication services , such as the ones used by connected cars . 
  it will also protect the rights of mobile and internet users wherever they are in the eu . 
  * a new european counter-terrorism agency helps to deter and prevent serious attacks through a systematic tracking and flagging of suspects . 
  & nbsp ; ** scenario 5 : doing much more together ** -- member states decide to share more power , resources and decision-making across the board . 
  decisions are agreed faster at european level and rapidly enforced . 
  by 2025 this could mean : * europeans who want to complain about a proposed eu-funded wind turbine project in their local area can not reach the responsible authority as they are told to contact the competent european authorities . 
  * connected cars drive seamlessly across europe as clear eu-wide rules exist . 
  drivers can rely on an eu agency to enforce the rules . 
  we will send our army into ukraine and syria , and hack the us elections . 
  then we will make eu pay for it .
