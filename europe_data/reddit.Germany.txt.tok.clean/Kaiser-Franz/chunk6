  not me . 
  asking for a friend cc : u/tsarnicholas, 
  and can we expect soon after that that the armed police in spain starts kicking out well tanned uk pensioners out of their villas and deports them to their cold rainy homeland ? 
  anybody knows how does the phone preform when it comes to ** privacy ** . 
  i would expect it to be relatively private , but maybe somebody has more insights . 
  pretty sad that the ship is deteriorating , hopefully they can figure out how to save it . 
   disaster , it should be conchita wurst . 
  on second thought , that cow looks lovely !, 
  the map shows the commercial and territorial expansion of the [ republic of pisa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_pisa ) in the early 12th century . 
  one of history 's great , but slightly less famous , maritime commercial empires . 
  the map also includes trade routes , colonies , and warehouses . 
  here is translation of the legend , from top to bottom : * conquered territories * areas of strong commercial penetration * great emporia and commercial colonies ( warehouses ) * concession of the kingdom of sicily under the suabian dinasty * main commercial routes . 
   ~ ~ a serbian man born in croatia . ~ ~ ftfy a global man , born in austrian empire ( modern-day croatia ) to a serbian family . 
  meanwhile my beloved ** r/austria ** -- tesla 's actual home country -- has a rather `` ungustl '' [ picture of a cow ] ( https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xmater7u2j_vitm0n1tukylm5txsxmxp7qkqzg_jm94.png ) where is this country going ... 
  there is an option `` gibt es nicht '' in the legend . 
  and somehow crimea is involved in the whole story as well !, 
  history is repeating itself , time to panic !, 
  / s  concert of europe -- it is suggested that it operated in europe from the end of the napoleonic wars ( 1815 ) to the early 1820s , while some see it as lasting until the outbreak of the ** crimean ** war , 1853-1856, 
   we would never be able to create federalism along the lines of us . 
  the reason is fundamentally very simple . 
  europe is a collection of various nations , various cultures and languages . 
  i do n't exactly agree with this . 
  same could be said for italy and germany prior its unification . 
  they ware ( are ) both cultural very divers , and the languages were not as standardized as they are today . 
  it was hard to imagine that bavarians would go along with the prussians ( still today ) , but then certain events happened that united them . 
  nations are at the end of the day just made up stories , and they exist only because we choose to believe in them . 
  for example non of current nations exited 5000 years ago . 
  so people can unite if the need to . 
  i believe that today we are so connected and dependent form each other that the `` national '' politics will not work anymore . 
  id does play a role of course , but there also needs to be also `` european '' and `` global '' politics , just like you currently have `` national '' , `` regional '' ect politics . 
  by your logic italy , germany , spain , turkey are not `` single economies '' either , simply because the difference between regions is too big . 
  [ regional unemployment rates ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/0/02/reg_unemployment_rates_2015_en.png ) how does that make sense ? 
  ever heard of this :  the european single market , internal market or common market is a single market that seeks to guarantee the free movement of goods , capital , services , and people -- the `` four freedoms '' -- within the european union ( eu ), 
   approval rating of 97 % . 
  is that you kim jong-un ? 
  & nbsp ; current situation seems to be that the ** economy is european ** , but ( most of ) ** politics is still on a national ** level . 
  due to recent events , we are at the crossroad where we either need to decide if we want to either make our politics european , or bring back the economy to the national level ( eg brexit ) . 
  at least that is the impression . 
  & nbsp ; both things have its pros and cons , but the realty is that we need both . 
  federal europe will not solve all the problems , especially some specific local ones . 
  same goes for national politics , which will have troubles solving bigger ( multi-national/global ) issues . 
  & nbsp ; i 'm not sure its the right solution , but * my impression * is that we would ** need a mix of both ** . 
  we would need to agree on what are the issues that need to be solved on the european level and give that body full authority . 
  not like now where eu proposes something and then because of 2-3 states disagree , proposal fails . 
  other things which are important on a national level should remain national , as national politics will be able to solve them better . 
  if we want to be pedantic , then the word `` terror attack '' does n't necessarily mean only westerners being killed by radical islamist . 
  it can mean many things . 
  he was implying that an event caused by immigrants yesterday made sweden an `` unsafe place '' ( hence i will make us safe ) . 
  yes , he didnt say it , but i think its pretty clear that he was implying it - terror attack that it . 
  it seems useless , but one of the benefits is [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5uxx67/you_know_youre_european_when/ddxq802/ ),

   i do n't deny there 's russian interference , but with little evidence provided , we should really stop campaigning or politicizing the issue . 
  i 'm not sure i agree . 
  i mean one thing is if events try to steer politics in germany where right-wingers do n't have a chance of winning the election , another is france where it seems to be possible . 
  as an open and democratic society it is always going to be tricky to find clear evidence . 
  nice !, 
  is that vaduz in the background ? 
  would n't [ miroslav ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miroslav_klose ) be better ? 
  you can clearly see that the eu flags was being used by the demonstrators . 
  this is a clear threat to mother russia and we need to liberate belarus from this nazi propaganda . 
  just to make sure we should also invade poland .

  well france is exporting a lot of its nuclear energy to italy , as does slovenia . 
  by that logic importers ( eg italy ) should be added to the list . 
  poor soviet building quality , i believe . 
  it is reliant in a sense of percentage share of country 's total generating capacity . 
  see data [ below ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tkent/nuclear_power_stations_in_europe/ddn6o32/ ), 
  & nbsp ; here is some data showing nuclear 's percentage share of each country 's total generating capacity . 
  & nbsp ; country | nuclear share | number of reactors | total capacity [ mw ] : -------- | : -------- :| : -------- :| : -------- france | 76.9 % | 58 | 63,130 slovakia | 56.8 % | 4 | 1,814 hungary | 53.6 % | 4 | 1,889 ukraine | 49.4 % | 15 | 13,107 belgium | 47.5 % | 7 | 5,927 sweden | 41.5 % | 10 | 9,470 switzerland | 37.9 % | 5 | 3,333 slovenia | 37.2 % | 1 | 688 czech republic | 35.8 % | 6 | 3,904 finland | 34.6 % | 4 | 2,752 bulgaria | 31.8 % | 2 | 1,926 armenia | 30.7 % | 1 | 375 spain | 20.4 % | 7 | 7,121 russia | 18.6 % | 34 | 24,654 romania | 18.5 % | 2 | 1,300 united kingdom | 17.2 % | 16 | 9,373 germany | 15.8 % | 9 | 12,074 netherlands | 4.0 % | 1 | 482 & nbsp ;, 
  here are some interesting facts about european countries and nuclear power . 
  & nbsp ; * fact # 1 : italy is the only country to have had operating nuclear power stations and then close them all down , although it imports electricity generated by nuclear power from france . 
  & nbsp ; * fact # 2 : slovenia is the smallest country , both by population ( 2 million ) and land area ( 20,273 km \u00b2 ; 7,827 sq mi ) , to have nuclear power . 
  & nbsp ; * fact # 3 : france is the country that is most reliant on nuclear power , which accounts for 76.9 % of its total electricity generation . 
  & nbsp ; * fact # 4 : europe has the largest number of countries that generate nuclear power ( 18 in total if you include armenia and russia ) , although north america has the largest share of countries ( 100 % ) that generate nuclear power . 
  everybody knows its * `` vienna first '' * , with prague close second .

  do n't know who is the biggest beer drinker in europe , but in slovenia they have [ europe 's first beer fountain ] ( https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2016/09/08/europes-first-beer-fountain-opens-taps-slovenia/ ) . 
   except maybe a little bit better in the czech republic , slovenia , baltics . 
  slovenia was not a little bit better . 
  it was doing quite well . 
  better the czechia and far ahead of baltics . 
  highways were built as slovenia has plenty of transit . 
  it 's the same reason why s\u00fcdbahn was built in the 1850s . 
  so , in order to get himself elected one should simply ` not try ' ? 
  does somebody have any analysis on what will happen to russia once putin dies ? 
  how realistic is the chance of russia dying with him ? 
  i can imagine the the power struggle ai n't going to be nice . 
  the longer he is in power the bigger the shitstorm we can expect . 
  it 's because for the first time a whole ethical group was selectively targeted ** with an aim to be eliminated completely ** . 
  in a relatively short time ** 50 % of it was killed ** . 
  so are estonia , poland , czechia and albania ( if you consider greece rich ) . 
  it 's more related to the fact that slovenia was under german ( bavarian and habsburg ) rule for 1500 years . 
  it was strategically important as it had acces to the sea so some infrastructure was always there . 
  infrastructure ? 
  yeah , if you do n't count air and railways . 
  but they are finally out of recession , so hopefully they 'll improve that as well . 
   #melania trump sparks tourism boom in slovenia  first lady of the united states melania trump * is contributing to a tourism surge * in her native slovenia , the country ' statistics office said monday . 
   some 1,939,000 tourists visited the alpine country of 2 million in the first half of this year , a 15 % increase from the same period last year , according to the slovenian statistics office . 
   analyzing the impact of the slovenian-born first lady on the tourism growth , the statistics office said the number of u.s. visitors has risen 15 % since donald trump took office in january . 
  only then you have this :  however , despite the overall growth , there was no remarkable change in overnight stays by visitors * to melania trump 's hometown , sevnica * .
