  do n't know man . 
  i would rather read this as people came to slovenia due to melania to visit her home country , but do n't visit her actual hometown . 
  they merely focus on the tourist attractions . 
  this is false imo . 
  tourism in slovenia is not growing because of her , at all . 
  if anything we got 50 more american tourists due to her being fotus . 
   which this article kinda says no offence , but did you check the headline ? 
  15 % rise in tourists from us ? 
  impressive . 
  is that like 2 families more , compared to the previous year ? 
  slovenia in tourism is growing indeed . 
  unfortunately ( / s ) it is not due to melania . 
  it 's a map for when you need to leave your current country asap , yet you do n't know which neighbouring country is actually the closest . 
  or it could be that those people , who were receiving unemployment money or social support money and therefore felt left out of the society . 
  now all of a sudden they were part of a program that was reported all over the news in finland and also worldwide . 
  this gave them a sense of being apart of something bigger and that their life has a purpose . 
  something they were lacking before . 
  to the supermarket . 
  with a chairlift . 
  right . 
  there is a `` save '' button , you know . 
  they look like a normal couple going for a hike . 
  whats the typical german thing here , that i fail to see ? 
  and `` democratisation '' of technology . 
  eg access to the internet via a smartphone , enabling africans to share ideas much faster . 
  they would not go to europe if they would n't think it 's possible . 
  and you learned that where ? 
  if anything brain need oils . 
   those tiny stickers are huge source of income i would n't call it huge . 
  you collect far more money with toll , but the problem is that you get long traffic jams in peak times . 
  anyways , the roads need to be build and maintained somehow . 
  easy way for all the criminals/immigrant to get into the country then ... 
  forest brothers , as the ones that `` helped '' nazis get rid of the jews ? 
   s\u00fcdl\u00e4nder those austrians at it again !, 
  estonians are not particularly chill people , if anything they are schizoid or melancholic . 
  a stereotypical montenegrin is lazy , not slow . 
  yuge difference . 
  you misspelt austria !, 
  ftfy i have an idea : let istria go back to ~ ~ italy ~ ~ austria . 
  so zagreb and ljubljana can not play games anymore !, 
  funny how the one saying * `` i do n't know '' * is a female . 
  i 'll see myself out ... 
  there is very little `` free weapons '' given away . 
  if anything , we can say there is no such thing as `` free weapons '' . 
  even uk needs to pay for the us weapons and they are an nato ally . 
  so , i am not sure i get the point you are trying to make . 
  no that 's chechnya . 
  that 's pretty cool , especially if she 's not wearing any bra ... i 'll see myself out . 
  what is the deal with the upper russian region ? 
  is it because if many oil companies ? 
  the metal detectors are installed there to prevent armed criminals entering it . 
  this is a result of what happened few days ago , where two arabs killed two policemen and then run into the mosque . 
  the aim was to cause provocation as police will have to enter and shut down the mosque . 
  nice way to * destroy * heritage, 
  they all seem to be coming to slovenia , tho ... 
  you forgot austria with vienna , mate . 
  good idea . 
  there seems to be plenty of lebensraum in the european far east . s, 
  i think you are confusing baltic sea for the mediterranean . 
  once at the baltic sea , you wear your swimsuit regardles of the weather and `` sunbathe '' on the beach even if it 's 10c and raining . 
  summer at the baltic sea - its a state of mind !, 
  also ljubljana  ** 1895 ljubljana earthquake **  the 1895 ljubljana earthquake or * the easter earthquake * struck ljubljana on easter sunday , 14 april . 
  it was the most destructive and the last destructive earthquake in the area . 
  i mean technically , ethnic russians are still estonian . 
  or you simply think that russians are some low level creatures that only do dugs and not much more ? 
  it 's just interesting how you are intrigued to prove your theory , but then when that proves wrong you are not interest to dig deeper . 
  i mean maybe they are russians after all . 
  yes , because somebody is going to invade serbia any day now . 
  not only buildings , all statues that are today exhibited as white were colored originally . 
  not sure what boat you are in , but prices in croatia were naturally a bit higher ( compared to other in the same region ) due to tourism . 
  tourism happened . 
  airb & b is good business . 
  why bother with renting long term a studio for 400 a month , when you can make 30-50 a day . 
   we are about to start building high-speed railways all around the republic in upcomming years , and specialy between prague and brno . 
  will we build this next to the railway or what ? 
  there will be no appetite for this hyperloop is an `` answer '' to us 's lack of interest in high-speed trains , as well as a general lack of investment in infrastructure . 
  hyperloop at this point is merely a pr push . 
  in europe on the other hand you dont have this problem , as it 's the eu commission that is pushing for more high-speed railways , to connect central and eastern european cities better . 
  if any hyperloops are going to get build in ce and ee , they will be build by private money , resulting in higer ticket prices . 
  fyi  * magistrale f\u00fcr europa * is a trans-european transport networks ( ten-t ) project for the creation of a high-speed railway line between paris and bratislava , with a branch-off to budapest . 
  it was listed as ten project no . 
  17 ( paris -- bratislava ) by the european commission in 1995 , and is already under way . 
   the project is ** planned to be completed by 2020 ** . 
  it will link 34 million people in five european countries . 
  the overall length of the route from paris to budapest is 1,592 km ( 989 mi ) . 
  germany might own eu , but it most certainly does n't rule it . 
  luxembourg will not be claiming anything , companies will . 
  they just provide the legal framework , which will protect those companies and their investments . 
  so did putin , when compared to yeltsin . 
  i think you are confusing brits with the irish . 
  same , same but different . 
  & nbsp ; this is thanks to sappho - a greek poetess and teacher from ancient times , born on that island . 
  she was basically a shakespeare of ancient greco-roman world but later banned by the church in early middle ages . 
  & nbsp ;  over 2,600 years ago , on an island called lesbos , in the sunny aegean sea near greece , there lived a woman of the aristocratic class named sappho . 
  she was beautiful and blessed by the gods and goddesses with the gifts of poetry , music , and teaching . 
  her poems were heralded , quite literally , near and far . 
  great poets , statesmen , and historians of antiquity lauded her name and praised her poetry . 
  sappho was the greatest and most acclaimed woman of ancient history . 
  & nbsp ;  in the custom of her society , she apparently married and had a daughter named cleis . 
  she read and sang her poetry to enthusiastic crowds .
