  which is why you should n't be linking to it from / r/europe ... 
  it 's a shame that the colour palette for res tags does n't include brown ... 
  maybe he 's just a carlin fan .

  ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ case , ^ ^ ^ `` they '' ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ pretty ^ ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ everyone , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ why ^ ^ ^ he 's ^ ^ ^ focussing ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ muslims ^ ^ ^ dicks ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ particular ... 
  ramen . 
  german exports also go through rotterdam & antwerp ... 
  they pay their denbts though ... 
   yes he 's benefitting the enemy , what `` enemy '' would that be exactly ? 
   yes he 'd pissed off the americans , is that supposed to be a bad thing ? 
   yes he 's a traitor ... ... no , he is n't,

   of course yes . . ( ... ) i want russia to break apart . . 
  i want us to break apart . . that would be fun to watch . 
   i want eu to break apart . . 
  i 'd rather see the european countries break apart inside the eu . . 
   no shilling , but here maps is great . 
  i used it during a visit in hamburg . 
  i took a quick look at the online version ( i 've lived in hamburg for 20 years ) . 
  it seems to be a good bit more detailed than google maps , at least in the ares of hamburg that i know well . 
  apparently , the bbc does n't know how the german legal system works ... 
  there never was a ban , the court 's decision was only binding for the concrete case . 
  no , it rather sounds like `` they might not like it , let 's ask them first . 
   myopic arguments that boil down to `` i do n't like it , so you should n't be allowed to do it ! '', 
  how about we boil it down to `` they might not like it , let 's ask them first . 
   so stop shoving your agenda on others - no one is forcing you to get cut . 
  let 's hope you apply that to your children , if/when you have any male ones ... 
  society has a duty to safeguard the rights of those who can not do so themselves . 
  whether circumcising a penis is right or wrong is for that penis 's owner to decide . 
   also just to add , a german court banned circumcisions until the government overruled it because of protests . 
   basically the german government  german courts and german law . 
  the court 's decision was only binding for the case in question , it did n't ban circumcisions . 
  the german government ** proposed ** a law that was then ** passed ** by the bundestag . 
  when the court in cologne gave it 's ruling , there was no law explicitly regulating circumcision . 
  the new law may still violate constitutional principles but that 's an issue only the constitutional court can settle . 
  ** tl : dr : you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  that 's what the court in cologne argued in the absence of a specific law . 
  now that there is a law that specifically allows it , that question would have to be decided by the bverfg . 
   germany has made [ more ] movement towards clamping down on circumcision ( ... ) nonsense , germany has moved from an unclear legal situation ( without a law explicitly regulating circumcision ) to explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision . 
   depends on how you punish parents who would violate the law against it . 
  there is no law against it . 
  there was no law explicitly concerning circumcision before the 2012 decison of a state court in cologne and after that , the government quickly scrambled to introduce a law explicitly allowing circumcision . 
   and thinks it is appropriate to take the lead in the eu and the developed world on this particular issue and seems legitimately proud of itself that they 've had so much political success with it at home . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  edit : a bit of background : http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/circumcision-debate-has-german-government-scrambling-for-a-law-a-846144.html, 
  yup , not mutilating children clearly is the first step towards genocide . 
   lower saxony , least bad saxony !, 
  ftfy, 
   we make equitable arrangements with our german business partners ? 
  ftfy, 
  oh relax , we 're over that whole lebensraum thing .

  ^ ^ ^ ^ surely , ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ could ^ ^ ^ ^ use ^ ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ ^ expert ^ ^ ^ ^ help ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ that ... 
  well , we * 're not all whiteys . 
  that was sort of my point ... * the inclusive we, 
  i 'm for turkish eu-membership overall , i was just trying to point out that there are a couple of valid reasons for being against it . 
  ( not just biggotry , although there 's a lot of that too ), 
   you took the comment too personally right ...  which is how i got to my assumption . 
  i 'd suspect you got it from a somewhat darker place . 
   no need to prove your ethnicity . 
  its the internet and we , or i have to things at face value - unless there is an obvious contradiction that insults my intelligence or i have a personal vested interest eg money or commitment . 
  you made it relevant when you suspected me to be `` turkish and butt hurt '' . 
  dammit !, 
  not even the arses can be asked to arse anymore ... 
  you found a comment you disagreed with and could n't think of a better answer than `` what a moronic statement . 
  '' , incidentally making a very moronic statement yourself while missing the obvious irony . 
  scimitar1 's comment was an opinion to argue about , yours was just moronic ... 
  http://i.imgur.com/yp9zoka.png i think you can guess ... 
  because you wrote a moronic comment that only said  what a moronic statement . 
  without being self-referential . 
  can we exclude a couple of states from that ? 
   so you 're calling everyone who is n't a supporter of a federal europe is stupid ? 
  what an elitist snob you are . 
  no , i 'm calling you stupid . 
   what the his original comments ' absurdity ? 
  yes . 
  ... what ? 
   who ** in their right mind ** fears that ? 
  no one . 
  ( ... ) and i was at least half-joking . 
  ( note the reference to the sub that shall not be named )  i 'm sorry , i think what you said is most likely sarcasm . 
  oh no , not sarcasm , please not sarcasm !, 
   so you agree that people that do n't support a federal europe are hyper nationalistic ? 
  and that without the eu we would n't have progress , unity or peace ? 
  ^ ^ what a moronic statement . 
  ( ... ) if this comment had ended there , would you think it could be called moronic ? 
  yes but it 's not exactly an improvement and turkey would probably wield more influence than hungary . 
  i did n't mean just you . 
  the constant switching between sweeping generalisations and nitpicking is rather tiring . 
   sovereign , independent nations are imagined communities too . 
  that was my point . 
  europe is continuum of cultures , grouping the nation states on the basis of `` national '' attributes in such a way would be nonsensical . 
   so i assume you concede defeat . 
  he 's probably tired of fighting the windmills of stupidity ... 
   that 's probably because anti-eurofed people are blinded by hyper-nationalism  saying that people who are anti-federalism are hypernationalism is a most ignorant statement . 
  necessarily all of them ?
