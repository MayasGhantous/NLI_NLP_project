  nah , a truck chassis wo n't be any better in mountainous terrain than a tank chassis like the pzh2000 . 
  it is however lighter and cheaper , a pzh2000 wo n't fit in an a400m while the archer & caesar will ( you can get the pzh2000 gun assembly with a [ different ] ( http://www.kmweg.de/uploads/pics/agm_boxer.jpg ) [ chassis ] ( http://www.kmweg.de/uploads/pics/028_01.jpg ) that will fit the a400m , though ),

   far-right/neonazis it 's just vandalism/hooliganism ( well , except breivik ) so think you this one incident is enough to fantasize about  the birth of domestic eu terrorism but you 're just going to discount breivik as an aberration ? 
  right ... who do you think the right target would have been ? 
  nonsense , our broomsticks of mass destruction will be ready for deployment in under 3 years !, 
  you 'd still have to trust humans ( the ones designing and deploying the electronic voting system ( s ) ) , it would just be fewer humans ( each with far more influence on the result , if they choose to try and manipulate the election ) . 
  making an electronic voting system that maintains anonymity and is resistant to manipulation and open to external control ( recounts , etc. ), 
  to the same degree as a paper ballot system is a very hard if not impossible task . 
  may i suggest a soundtrack ? 
  are you suggesting we take the likelihood of people sending parcle bombs ` in response ' into consideration when formulating policy ? 
  if not , the motivation of the ` response ' and whether it is in any way understandable or foreseeable is utterly irrelevant ( apart from it 's potential use for identifying the culprit ) . 
  yes , sending your ` message ' in form of a parcel bomb is such a great way to get what you want ... 
  maybe they just thought this was the customary german way to ask for debt restructuring ...

   i literally linked the article to you . 
  and i read that article front to back ( did you ? 
  ) , she does not proclaim herself a stalin supporter anywhere in it . 
  some passages seem to paint a rather rosy picture of stalinism but since this article is written in response to an ongoing debate , it 's hard to tell whether that represents her ` complete ' view of stalinism or whether she 's just touching on the aspects with which that debate was concerned , without knowing the full context . 
  at any rate , i 'm not a fan of wagenknecht and i would n't have objected to you calling her an apologist for stalinism but that article is no basis for the ` self proclaimed stalin supporter ' claim you made . 
   but you probably also have no problem with h\u00f6cke demanding a change in rembrance culture then ? 
  i resent the implication . 
  if me disagreeing with your reading of a source is enough for you to imply that i am , basically , a neo-nazi ( or even just an afd supporter , i would consider that alone a deadly insult ) , i see little chance of having an intelligent conversation with you . 
  i 'm still waiting for a source for the ` self proclaimed stalin supporter ' claim ... 
  even if i just ignore that she wrote that 25 years ago when she was 23 , i could see that you might call her an apologist for stalinism based on that but even that is a bit of a reach . 
  that text is part of a fairly specific debate among east german communists , not an exhausive decription of stalinism . 
  nowhere in that text does she ` proclaim herself ' a supporter of stalin , i have no idea where you 're getting that . 
   it was n't even a colony anymore , it was an integral part of france and  many french people lived there ( pieds noirs ) but locals had limited rights and did n't have the french nationality . 
  ca n't really both be true , can they ?

  sch\u00e4uble and merkel have a voter base to cater to , most of the support for merkels relatively generous refugee policy comes from voters of parties left of hers while her own party is rather split on the issue . 
  support for the policy towards greece was split along similar lines .

  for the parts of the financial sector where scale effects matter a lot , paris and frankfurt are the most likely destinations . 
  for the parts that need a large number of local employees that are fluent in english ( since english is the working language of the british and the international financial sector ) , it 's dublin it 's easier to get your british employees to move there , too ) . 
  for the parts that can benefit from a close relationship with governments , paris , berlin , frankfurt ( -  ecb ) & brussels might be most attractive . 
  overall , paris may have the edge in the long run and dublin in the short run . 
   i doubt the mk3 will disappear quickly ( if at all ) but i also doubt that we will ever see a mk4 .
