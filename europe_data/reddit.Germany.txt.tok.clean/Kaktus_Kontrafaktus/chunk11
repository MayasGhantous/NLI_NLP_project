  the 13 billion are just the difference between what apple should have paid ( according to the normal irish corporate tax rate ) and what they actually paid ( due to a special tax deal with the irish goverment which the commission considers to be illegal state aid under art .

  nonsense !, 
  we only hate the english . 
   then i would love to know why i had to pay about 40 euros at customs to get out a present a friend sent me ** that they paid $ 25 for in america . 
  ** having a receipt for that purchase would have been good ...  the bs excuse they gave me was that the item sent to me would sell for 100 euros in the eu ( without proof ) did you provide any material to establish the value of the item ? 
  really ? 
  cool !, 
  *** vassals , assemble !, 
   castle lol , no, 
  no , this is just fantasy . 
  first , the eu has no tariffs `` on american goods '' . 
  goods from countries that do n't have an fta with the eu ( [ here 's a list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) ) are subject to [ `` most favoured nation '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/most_favoured_nation ) tariffs under wto rules , there are no special tariffs on american goods . 
  second , the eu 's mfn tariffs are generally quite low , there are some peaks in tariff levels ( usually with protectionist intention ) but there are little to no tariffs on the vast majority of goods imported from the us . 
  here 's the relevant section from an impact assessment the eu commission made before ttip negotiations started :  ** 2.3.1 tariffs **  in general , both the eu and the us have low tariffs on goods , with simple average mfn tariff rates of 5.2 % and 3.5 % . 
  the trade-weighted tariff protection in the us for eu exports is estimated at 2.1 % , while the trade-weighted tariff rate for us exports to the eu is estimated at 2.8 % . 
   eu tariff peaks are concentrated on the agricultural side with levels depending on the methodology used to estimate ad valorem equivalents of specific tariffs . 
  on the industrial side the highest eu tariffs ( 22 % ) can be found in trucks , followed by some footwear ( 17 % ) and audio-visual products ( 14 % ) , and clothing ( 12 % ) . 
  on the us side peaks in agriculture are somewhat lower with the clear exception of processed agricultural products ( e.g. 
  tariffs on tobacco are 350 % ) . 
  compared to the eu , the us clearly has more peaks in industrial products , e.g. 
  in textiles ( 40 % ) , clothing ( 32 % ) , leather and footwear ( 56 % ) . 
  however , in general , these higher tariffs only account for a fraction of bilateral trade ( 2 % of eu imports and 0.8 % of us imports ) . 
  [ source ( page 17 ) ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150759.pdf ) i have imported things from the us quite a few times myself and i 've never paid any tariffs . 
  obviously , your ( or my ) personal experience is a poor way to measure overall tariff levels ...

  it got finished just in time for the brexit talks . 
  do you require a demonstration ? 
  what exactly would we need * him * for ? 
  iter might solve many of the problems that would also face a full-sized stellarator . 
  if stellarator research is far enough along when the planning for demo starts , it might become a stellarator . 
  the faster iter achieves it 's goales , the higher the likelyhood that demo is a tokomak though , i do n't really know which to wish for ... 
  you mean [ this thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_fusion_materials_irradiation_facility ) ? 
  needs more euromonies !, 
  it took twice as long and cost twice as much as expected ... so everything went as expected . 
  compared to the incompetent cunts building our recent airports , train stations & concert halls , the guys at the [ ipp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/max-planck-institut_f%c3%bcr_plasmaphysik ) have way better excuses , though ... 
   it was discovered that the weird shape made containing the hot stuff easier . 
  that what already theorised in the 50 's but finding a shape that actually works turned out to be rather hard , so most research was done on tokamaks . 
  modern supercomputing has made it possible to find a shape that actually works , turns out it looks a bit weird ... 
  in a simple torus shape ( like a tokamak ) , the magnetic field tends to be weaker on the outside of the torus ( -  plasma tends to hit the outer wall ) , a tokamak induces a current into the plasma to correct for this but that produces interactions between the magnetic field that the turbulent plasma produces and the confinement field that are hard to control . 
  the stellarator uses a complexly shaped confinement field to constantly twist the plasma instead . 
  without the current , the plasma is easier to control but this requires this very complex shape . 
  only the advances in supercumputing over the last ~ 25 years ( planning for wendelstein 7-x started in the 90 's ) have made this kind of design possible , so stellarator research is a step behind tokamak research but stellarators are more suitable for continous operation ( which is more useful for commercial/industial applications ) . 
  wendelstein 7-x will not produce fusion reactions ( the plasma is heated externaly using microwaves ) but if it works , it will be able to contain plasma under conditions that would allow for self-sustaining fusion reactions for extended periods of time . 
  wendelstein is too small to produce a net-gain of energy ( if it was filled with deuterium-tritium plasma ) but a scaled-up version would be . 
  a larger version would look similar to iter , the reaction chamber would be surrounded by radiation shielding filled with lithium . 
  fast neutrons from the fusion reactions would hit the shielding , react with the lithium to produce helium & tritium ( to replenish the plasma ) and heat up the shielding . 
  the heat from the shielding would be extracted using a cooling circuit ( probably with water but there are other options ) like in current nuclear plants . 
  the heat loss from the plasma roughly scales with the surface area but the heat produced scales with the volume & density . 
  larger machines are more efficient but as long as we 're still in the experimental phase , smaller machines can do most of the work for less money . 
  wendelstein has cost 1.06 billion $ thusfar ( 1997-2014 ) , iter is expected to cost more than 20 billion $ overall . 
  if it 's a success , iter will probably have solved most of the problems that would face a full-sized stellarator ( besides the method of confinement , the reactors would be quite similar ) but an iter-sized stellarator might still cost 5-10 billion $ . 
   `` as expected '' aka takes more energy to run it that it makes . 
  typical bullshit i hear about all cool technology . 
  kick ass fast charging batteries , ultra super capacitors ... all bullshit . 
  it is n't meant to produce energy , it 's not even meant to produce any fusion reactions . 
  the fusion processes themselves are fairly well understood , other facilities like the [ jet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_european_torus ) ( they 're planning to start using deuterium-tritium plasma in 2018 ) or [ jt-60 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jt-60 ) are doing the fusion research . 
  wendelstein 7-x is n't about nuclear physics , it 's about plasma physics and whether the plasma is heated by fusion or with external heat sources ( using microwaves , in this case ) does n't make much of a difference . 
  producing fusion reactions in wendelstein 7-x would require a lot of safety measures ( and a lengthy certification process ) , it just would n't be worth the extra time & money . 
  wendelstein 7-x 's target is containing the plasma ( first hydrogen , then deuterium ) under conditions that would allow for deuterium-tritium fusion for 30min or more . 
  there already are tokamak machines at this scale but wendelstein is the first stellarator of this size . 
  iter will be a full-scale ( = large enough for breakeven and to develope the technology for commercial reactors ) tokamak reactor . 
  stellarator research is a step behind because it requires very complex magnetic field configurations ( something like wendelstein was impossible to design before the advent of modern supercomputers ) but if stellarators work as intended , they can be more stable and more suitable for continuous ( rather than pulsed ) operation . 
  thusfar , wendelstein 7-x seems to perform very well ( better than expected ) . 
  if it continues that way , the next step would be an iter-sized reactor . 
  the experience gained with iter ( deuterium-tritium plasma behaviour , radiation shielding , etc. ), 
  will inform the design of future stellarators . 
  if all goees well , planning for the next generation stellarator will probably start around 2020 and construction could be finished in the early 2030 's . 
  that will be a more expensive machine ( 5 ~ 10 billion $ or more , wendelstein 7-x has cost just over 1 billion $ thusfar ) , so it will probably have to be a european or international project ( like iter ) . 
  in recent years , germany and japan have invested most in stellarator research and after europe ( euratom pays 45 % ) , japan is the 2nd largest contributor to iter ( 18 % , china , india , south korea , russia & the usa pay 9 % each ) , so an international project centered around germany/eu and japan seems likely . 
  a project of that size would be hard to fund through public research budgets but such international projects tend to add a lot of complications because every country involved will try to secure as much of the know-now produced as possible for it 's own industry . 
  a european project might be a more efficient solution but it will be hard to secure funding for another iter-sized project before iter is even finished . 
  i wish the german government would just say `` here 's 10 billion $ , do your thing '' but that seems unlikely ... 
  the fusion processes themselves are fairly well understood , other facilities like the [ jet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_european_torus ) ( they 're planning to start using deuterium-tritium plasma in 2018 ) are doing the fusion research .
