  if it continues that way , the next step would be an iter-sized reactor . 
  the experience gained with iter ( deuterium-tritium plasma behaviour , radiation shielding , etc. ), 
  will inform the design of future stellarators . 
  if all goees well , planning for the next generation stellarator will probably start around 2020 and construction could be finished in the early 2030 's . 
  that will be a more expensive machine ( 5 ~ 10 billion $ or more , wendelstein 7-x has cost just over 1 billion $ thusfar ) , so it will probably have to be a european or international project ( like iter ) . 
  in recent years , germany and japan have invested most in stellarator research and after europe ( euratom pays 45 % ) , japan is the 2nd largest contributor to iter ( 18 % , china , india , south korea , russia & the usa pay 9 % each ) , so an international project centered around germany/eu and japan seems likely . 
  a project of that size would be hard to fund through public research budgets but such international projects tend to add a lot of complications because every country involved will try to secure as much of the know-now produced as possible for it 's own industry . 
  a european project might be a more efficient solution but it will be hard to secure funding for another iter-sized project before iter is even finished . 
  i wish the german government would just say `` here 's 10 billion $ , do your thing '' but that seems unlikely ... 
  here 's another german one : https://resonator-podcast.de/2014/res032-der-wendelstein-7-x/ and an english talk at oxford : https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/stellarators-fusion-energy-and-wendelstein-7-x-experiment, 
   yeah , it is an experimental reactor . 
  its purpose is to advance the understanding of plasma physics , ~ ~ fusion ~ ~ , stellarator configuration , etc. 
  ftfy edit : there wo n't be any fusion in wendelstein 7-x . 
  no , wendelstein 7-x is n't meant for any kind of fusion . 
  at the moment , they 're using hydrogen plasma and they intend to switch to deuterium plasma in 2019 , the plasma is heated using microwaves . 
  wendelstein 7-x is simply too small to reach breakeven and the fusion reactions themselves are already very well understood , preparing it for fusion would just have made it more expensive . 
  if wendelstein 7-x is a success , the next step would be a full-sized reactor ( like iter ) . 
  that would probably have to be an international ( or at least european ) project . 
  the original stellarator concept was developed in the us in 1951 ( at the princeton plasma physics laboratory ) , fusion research was highly classified at the time , so the project got a military code name : project [ matterhorn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matterhorn ) . 
  it became clear that controlled nuclear fusion was n't going to have military applications anytime soo , so the research was declassified in 1958 . 
  when the max planck institute of plasma physics started their fusion research at their site in garching ( near munich ) , they picked another alpine mountain , the [ wendelstein ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wendelstein_%28mountain%29 ) to name their stellarator designs . 
  most of these designs where never built ( the most significant ones are wendelstein 2a , 7-a & 7-as ) , the 7-x is the latest version .

  where are you getting that from ? 
  there 's no data for crimea , probably because it 's under russia control and gfk is n't getting any data from russia . 
  if ukraine could provide current data for crimea , they 'd probably use it ... 
  how do you imagine they would get the data for 2016 ? 
  you 're probably suffering from beer deprivation ...

   is making your kids go to school forcing them ? 
  yes . 
   is making your kids eat vegetables forcing them ? 
  yes . 
   is vaccinating a child forcing them ? 
  yes . 
   it 's a choice a parents make . 
  yes , but in all these cases , parents are not free to make any choice they like . 
  at least in most ` western ' societies , children are considered persons in their own right with rights that state & society are obliged to respect and protect . 
  for the most part , the parents are considered to be the most qualified & legitimate authority to make decisions on behalf - and in the interest of - their children but there are limits to that authority . 
  how much discretion in the interpretation of their childrens ' interests parents should be given , at what age certain decisions can be made by the children themselves and at what point state & society are obliged to step in and protect the childrens ' rights against their parents ' wishes is a serious and complex question . 
  however , whether the parents ' discretion is limited at all is a rather simple question . 
  if children are persons in their own right ( with their own rights ) , the parents ' discretion must be limited in some way and the decisions that parents ( or anyone else ) make on their behalf require justification . 
  the examples you mentioned have quite obvious justifications and in all those cases , the decisions ca n't be postponed until the children are capable of making them by themselves without serious consequences in the interim . 
  but forcing others is ok if they 're children ? 
   i do n't give a shit , as long as thou do n't force on others . 
  so , you agree with the danish doctors then ...

   if ukip had made this request after brexit had been completed , then this is the appropriate time to facepalm .

  maybe someone should revise it ... edit : just to clarify , i 'm talking about the low-quality memorial , not the treaty .

   it was a command vehicle that was n't supposed to be armed . 
  which would have made it stand out among the vehicles of the same type ( hint : that would be bad ) , the broomstick was just meant to make it appear armed from a distance . 
   in this case all russian citizens are potential military risk and should therefore be immediately deported from countries where they live . 
  in that case ** , ** all nato - and/or eu-countries that do so should be kicked out at once .

  you picked greece as an example , i just tried to make it work ... you 're claiming that there is some core of truth to the notion that the eu makes it easier for germany to exert power in europe . 
  germany would be able to do that with or without the eu , of course we need a scenario that can occur with or without the eu to judge whether the eu provides germany with some additional means of power or if it keeps germany from exerting power in ways that would otherwise be available to it . 
  germany did n't dictate european policy during the crisis , it was just the most influential member of a coalition that supported those policies . 
    nuclear war is essentially suicide for both sides   that 's a serious problem . 
  yes . 
  unless we can actually get rid of nuclear weapons ( * everyone * would have to disarm and there would have to be a very ( ! ), 
  dependable mechanism to keep * anyone * from building any new nukes ) , all we can do is manage the risk . 
  no one ( at least no one who currently has nukes ) is actually interested in starting a nuclear war , we need to make sure that unintentionally causing a nuclear exchange is as hard as possible . 
  nuclear powers need to make clear in what circumstances they * would * use nukes and in what circumstances they * would n't * . 
  the threats that * are * made need to be made as credible as possible ( if they are not credible enough to reliably deter , they should n't be made in the first place ) . 
  the use of nuclear weapons needs to be as * predictable * as possible . 
  so ... you think if there was no eu and greece was looking for a bailout ( for some other reason ) , germany would n't have been in a position to make demands ? 
  how else do you think nuclear deterrence works ? 
  nuclear war is essentially suicide for both sides . 
  if you want to effectively deter another nuclear power , you have to be able to * credibly * threaten to commit suicide ( well , murder-suicide ) . 
  of course both sides know that this threat is only made to deter but it * has * to be a credible threat anyway . 
  if the other side does n't * actually * believe that nuclear retaliation is at least a real possibility , it does n't work . 
  the cost of nuclear escalation outweighs any possible gains to such an extent that you do n't actually need certainty . 
  as long as nuclear retaliation is considered a real possibility , any rational actor will consider the risk ( compared to the possible gains ) to be too high . 
  the really dangerous part is ` deterrence failure ' ( e.g. 
  russia invading the baltics , not believing that nato 's nuclear powers might * actually * be willing to risk nuclear war to protect nato 's periphery ) . 
  if one nuclear power misjudges another nuclear power 's willingness to make good on it 's threats , a conventional conflict can escalate to nuclear war . 
  and make them pay for it . 
  would you mind showing me that ` grain of truth ' ? 
  what way of ` subduing ' or ` dominating ' anyone ( in europe ) does the eu give germany which it would n't have without the eu ? 
  just to be clear , that warm seat is only for the scots ( and northern irish ) . 
  no warmth for the english , not a single microjoule !, 
   some people the word you were looking for is `` idiots '' .
