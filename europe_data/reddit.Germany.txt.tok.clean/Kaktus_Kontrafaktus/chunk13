  can i help ? 
  so this  two of these dykes will run alongside the coastlines of england and continental europe , a few kilometers away from the existing coastline , thus ensuring that the existing coastlines and coastal ecosystems will remain unchanged . 
  was nonsense then ? 
  because of size and capacity restriction , a large part of europe < -  asia traffic goes around the cape of good hope rather than through the suez canal . 
  the dover strait is * far * busier than the suez canal . 
  look at the heat map i posted and imagine a large majority of that traffic concentrated in one channel along the mainland coast ( you can bunch all the lanes together but you ca n't make them thinner , safety distances are n't optional ) . 
  how wide would you guess that channel would have to be ? 
  there 's a reason the shipping lanes through the channel currently look [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/du1pzvt.png ) . 
  marine traffic congestion in the dover strait is a problem already , the channels you suggest would be far more problematic . 
  you forgot one : ** disadvantages : ** ( ... ) 5 ) the world 's busiest shipping lane would disappear and europe 's 4 largest ports would be cut off from the atlantic,

  so did you . 
  contemplate shoving your spam up your arse, 
   if the brits are faking , then among the potential scenarios , officials said , is a stall for time that would leave the eu side feeling pressured to agree to a future trade deal rather than allow a disorderly withdrawal . 
  i 'm sure that would n't backfire spectacularly ... 
  i 'm afaid the ` cunning plan ' has already been [ leaked ] ( https://youtu.be/mdkcnypmm6w?t=1m6s ) ... 
  seriously ? 
  fuck off and take your spam with you !, 
  no , it is n't . 
  consult a thesaurus , please . 
   ridicilously pessimistic and exaggerated it 's just completely incoherent . 
  it says a lot about how you see the world , though . 
  if turkey joined , the member states that just voted for turkish accession ( which would of course be all of them ) would n't be scheduling referenda to leave a week later . 
  it 's an utterly delusional hypothetical and that 's before we get to germany electing a turkish chancellor and starting ww3 the next day ... 
   day 1 : turkey joins the eu . 
  that would require unanimous agreement by all member states , so day 8 to day 420 are just your delusional fantasy ... 
  lol , no, 
  fuck off , you miserable cunt !, 
  no , you 're not . 
  ok . why did you think we needed to know that ?

  also , ~ 8 % ( most recent figures i could find on short notice : ~ 150000/1750000 in 2010 , ~ 50000 ( ~ 2.9 % ) of which regularly attended a mosque ) is apparently `` very high '' ... 
  it was never illegal in the first place . 
  the copyright fell to the state of bavaria after the war and they did n't allow publication ( as any copyright holder could ) , the copyright just ran out so there 's no way to stop publication anymore . 
   same here . 
  no , it is n't . 
  since the constitutional court legalised successive adoption for same-sex partners in 2013 , the last remaining concrete legal difference between civil unions and marriages was concurrent adoption . 
  however , including same-sex unions in the legal concept of marriage ensures that any future legislation concerning marriage equally applies to them and - perhaps most importantly - same-sex unions are now covered by article 6 ( 1 ) of the constitution ( `` special protection of marriage and family '' ) . 
   the german constitution explicity states that marriage is between a man and a woman . 
  no it does n't , you ignorant fuck . 
  good luck with that ... 
  sorry , i thought you were whining and meant the debate in the bundestag that started ( and ended ) today . 
   it 's been discussed in the legal affairs commitee dozens of times but it 's been kept from the parliament floor with the votes of the governing coalition .

  today was the last legislative session before the election , it 's not quite clear whether she expected spd , greens & linke to be able force a vote in time . 
  since all their potential coalition partners made same-sex marriage a condition for a coalition after the next election , the cdu/csu was going to have to give some ground . 
  it 's not like she orchestrated this vote , the other parties quickly jumped on her general statement ( on this being a ` question of conscience ' ) and forced her hand . 
  both in the legal affairs commitee ( on bringing the motion to the parliament floor ) and in the bundestag ( on allowing it to be added to the day 's agenda ) , the cdu/csu voted against it en bloc and representatives of her party have been bitching about the motion being ` hurried to the floor ' all day . 
  it seems more likely that she tried to reduce the issue 's salience with the propect of a ` vote of conscience ' after the election . 
  ~ ~ 73 ~ ~ 75 out 309 cdu/csu mps voted for it .

  nonsense . 
  the president is supposed to act in a nonpartisan fashion , he 's expected to hold his party membership in abeyance but he 's not required to quit his party . 
  there * has * been endless debate , it 's been discussed in the legal affairs commitee dozens of times but it 's been kept from the parliament floor with the votes of the governing coalition . 
  the motion that was voted on today has been prepared for a long time . 
   marriage is culturally and historically between a man and a woman for most of it 's history it was mainly a transfer of quasi-property between father and husband , marriage as a voluntary union of two equals is a rather new development . 
  in principle , he could delay ratification on grounds of unconstitutionality but that would be highly unlikely even if he was n't a member of one of the parties that just voted for it en bloc .

  that seems to be quite common in scandinavia , the transparency of goverment institutions is quite exemplary in many areas but the trust that those institutions are afforded also extends to areas where it is n't really warranted ( e.g.

  / u/jfokkec is obviously talking about retail vendors , not manufacturers ... 
  it 's amazon 's dominant position in some markets that allows it to expand into smaller markets . 
  in markets will well functioning competition ( e.g. 
  the market for pc hardware in germany ) profit margins tend to be very small , so it 's hard for the vendors to acquire the necessary capital to expand into other markets . 
   some shady german sites if you 're just going to assume that amazons potential competitors are shady , you 'll never get that homegrown alternative .
