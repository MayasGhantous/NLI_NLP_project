  the version that the gign chose over the hk416 is 7.62 x39 and they chose it for the calibre . 
  the version of the bren that was meant to compete as a standard service rifle was obviously the 5.56 x45 version . 
   cz was unable to participate in the process as it came in too late . 
  so instead of that hk416 won , but special forces prefered the cz over hk . 
  the gign chose 7.62 x39 over 5.56 x45 ( and 7.62 x51 ) . 
  this does n't indicate that the 5.56 x45 bren is a better gun than the hk416 , just that 7.62 x39 fits the gign 's changed requirements better than 5.56 x45 . 
  edit : i did a bit of research , hk currently does n't have a 7.62 x39 rifle they could have offered and their 7.62 x51 rifles ( e.g. 
  hk417 , g28 ) are designed as designated marksman rifles and too bulky for the gign 's needs . 
  they 're planning a 7.62 x39 version of the [ hk433 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_hk433 ) ( newly developed to compete as the next standard service rifle of the german army ) that might fit the bill . 
  precisely manufactured parts can work with little to no lubrication , so i expect the kruppstahl strap-ons will go in dry ... 
  read the source he linked , the gign 's looking for a larger calibre rifle ( to penetrate bullet-proof vests ) that 's still reasonably compact ( for close-quarter combat ) . 
  they did n't chose cz over hk , they chose 7.62 x39mm over 5.56 x45mm ( not enough stopping power ) and 7.62 x51mm ( too bulky ) . 
  i 'm not sure if hk has a direct competitor for the cz bren , the hk416 surely is n't it . 
  the hk416 and cz bren are n't direct competitors . 
  gign was looking for a relatively compact weapon with more stopping power ( to go through bullet-proof vests ) than any 5.56 \u00d7 45mm rifle ( like the hk416 ) could provide . 
  this does n't mean that the cz bren is a better weapon of the same type as the hk416 , it 's a different type . 
  i 've quoted the relevant parts of your source below , maybe you can read it this time ...  ( ... ) the gign has selected the 7.62 x 39 mm version of the rifle and placed an initial order for 68 units earlier in 2017 . 
   additional procurements are slated to take place in the near future with the aim of replacing the majority of the h&k 416s currently in service . 
   the decision to adopt the bren 2 was the result of a process that began in 2015 after the paris attacks in january that year . 
  ** faced with terrorists equipped with bullet-proof vests , french gendarmerie and police intervention units found that 9 mm weapons had little efficiency in such situations and that 5.56 mm ammo lacked the necessary stopping power . 
  **  the cz spokesperson said that the gign identified a need for a new weapon able to fire a heavier bullet . 
  ** the 7.62 x 51 mm calibre had the suitable characteristics but the weapons for this calibre were considered too heavy and bulky for efficient close-quarter combat . 
  **  thus , gign decided to evaluate assault rifles chambered in the 7.62 x 39 mm calibre instead and undertook trials throughout 2015 with a variety of weapons . 
  the requirements for a standard service rifle are quite different from the needs of special forces unit . 
  for example , the chosen calibre is always a trade-off between the effective range ( and penetration against weak armor , walls , etc. ), 
  and the number of rounds a soldier can carry . 
  this hardly matters for a special forces unit but there 's a reason why most standard service rifles in nato use 5.56 \u00d7 45mm . 
  if the french army was going to pick a larger calibre rifle , they 'd almost certainly go for one using 7.62 x51mm nato standard ammo ( e.g. 
  hk417 ) rather then 7.62 x39mm like the cz bren .

   so basically , instead of going the extra mile to work with the scots ( who may be fully on board , or not ? ), 
  their politicians do n't seem to think so ...  you 'd rather kick them all out ? 
  or otherwise not have them in the eu ? 
  i 'd rather everything was decided by some form of qualified majority rather than unanimity . 
  let me put it like this : muh superstate with scots  muh superstate without scots    status quo with scots  status quo without scots e.g. 
  i 'd prefer a full political union of just the founding members to the status quo . 
  of course , any additional member would be welcome and worth some compromise but i expect that quite a few current members would require more compromise then they 're worth ( in terms of the difference they make for the overall chance of success of the project , for example : france & germany would probably be essential while malta 's membership would only make a marginal difference ) . 
   i genuinely can not see how scotland has acted in such a manner , at least in the mep , for instance . 
  scottish politics tend to differ from westminster politics . 
  i 'm not suggesting that scotland would be exceptionally obstructive but it would likely be among the less integration-friendly members ( along with e.g. 
  i 'm not too worried about scotland accepting the status quo eu ( they do n't have much choice ... ) but about the additional limits that it might put on changing that status quo . 
  tl : dr : i want muh postnational superstate and i fear the scots ( , danes , etc. ), 
  wo n't go along with it so i 'd rather have it without them than no at all . 
   probably not at the time . 
  i remember reading an article about the eurozone that looked back on this in hindsight . 
  was it , by any chance , in a british paper ? 
   so what 's all this about scotland being a brake on integration ? 
  and wanting special treatment ? 
  i fear sturgeon is going down the same route as many other british politicians , misrepresenting reality to get majorities and crying foul when reality refuses to conform to their fictions . 
   `` we do n't want to go into the euro . 
  ** no member of the eu can be forced into the euro . 
  ** '' if this is what it takes to get scotland to join the eu as it stands today , how can we expect them to accept further integration ? 
  until all decisions are made by qmv ( or some other form of qualified majority ) , any country can stall the whole project . 
  i 'm just not sure that scotland 's worth the risk ... 
   from what i can recall about how the eurozone was established : it was meant to be an entirely voluntary affair to reflect the prevailing mood back then that it was for member states to decide in their independent , sovereign , capacity to join together on the next step of `` ever closer union '' . 
  it clearly ca n't have been that clear since denmark and the uk felt the need for formal opt-outs ...  i think what sturgeon may be angling for would be a clause stating that they 'll come back to that later i.e. 
  we 'll commit but we 'll talk details later when we 've sorted out the deficit , for one . 
  how would that differ from any other recent accession treaty ? 
  it 's not like a newly independent would fulfill the convergence criteria from the start ... 
   that is a simple explanation of how joining the euro works , and scotland will likely join it after the economy post-independence stabilises and public opinion is turned . 
  that 's how it has worked thusfar because no one 's forced the issue , whether the loophole really works is something that the ecj would have to decide . 
  if sturgeon wants to promise her voters that they 'd have to be consulted again before scotland joins the eurozone , she needs to obtain a formal opt-out .

  can we just restart the whole thing with qmv for everything ( including treaty changes ) ?
