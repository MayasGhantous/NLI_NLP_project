  quite a few of them ? 
  yes . 
  his ? 
  yours ? 
  yes . 
  as did i , [ i 'm glad to be wrong thought . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3asx2i/are_you_in_for_a_real_unification/csg4xcr ), 
  some , i had a bit of a short circuit in my head and took your comment as sarcastic . 
  i 'm totally with you . 
  i 'd even consider starting with splitting germany up into regions , just the assuage the fear of german reichtanglification . 
   rampage lol , what ? 
  no , i 'm a german/danish dual citizen and have spent most of my life in germany . 
  i might even be able to find the old `` ariernachweise '' of my german grandparents , if you insist . 
  you refer to `` germany '' as `` we '' and then wonder why people might assume that you 're german ? 
  you 're welcome , i rather like it , too . 
   dont put ** germany ** in the same group as the rest . 
  we have impressive productivity and quality . 
  ** we ** are exporting champs . 
  personaly , i would consider any permanent resident of the federal republic a `` german '' , at least as far as being `` german '' is relevant at all . 
  360 from the english translation :  on the other hand , the cheapest form of pride is national pride ; for the man affected therewith betrays a want of individual qualities of which he might be proud , since he would not otherwise resort to that which he shares with so many millions . 
  the man who possesses outstanding personal qualities will rather see most clearly the faults of his own nation , for he has them constantly before his eyes . 
  but every miserable fool , who has nothing in the world whereof he could be proud , resorts finally to being proud of the very nation to which he belongs . 
  in this he finds compensation and is now ready and thankful to defend , ... all the faults and follies peculiar to it . 
  right , my turkish-german neighbours ( most of them born in germany ) executed a genocide in 1915 ... 
   fine , just remember that the people you take it from , support terrorism , support misogyny and putting down women , genocided the armenians , and currently the kurds , enslaved bulgarians and treated us like animals for 500 years , still have the death penalty , rape european tourists , and so on and so on . 
  good , let it all out . 
  keeping all that bigotry bottled up inside too long is n't good for you . 
  btw , the closest d\u00f6ner shop here 's owned by an atheist third-generation immigrant . 
  that is n't exactly unusual for a german turk . 
  good for you ... 
  i 'm off to get myself some kebap . 
  regardless , having more children is n't a sign of better parenting . 
  it 's like you just presume that i 'm a christian ... it 's fucking insulting . 
  edit ( since the comment i replied to has changed completely ) :  well fuck you too . 
   i did n't say that i 'd prefer turks over bulgarians or muslims over christian . 
  ** i prefer non-bigots over bigots . 
  and you simplified those to the point of being little more than stereotypes in the process ... 
  well , you can always leave our glorious supranational union and do your own thing . 
  qmv , heard of it ? 
  agreed . 
  except for the tunnel , a road tunnel of that length would have a lot of problems . 
  the money would be far better spent on new hsr lines anyway . 
  we 'll ^ ^ * take quebec & ontario , you can keep the rest . 
  deal ? 
  ^ ^ * by ^ ^ we ^ ^ i ^ ^ mean ^ ^ the ^ ^ eu, 
  i rather like my turkish neighbours , the muslims among them ( turkey as a long secular tradition , it 's not exactly saudi arabia ) are certainly no worse than my christian neighbours . 
  i 'd take a turkish muslim over a christian bulgarian bigot any day ... 
  and borders with syria & iraq ... having erdogan in the council does n't exactly sound great either . 
  just shut up , you 're embarrassing the rest of us . 
  perfect , let 's devide europe by stereotypes !, 
  that 'll work just great ... 
  neither are most national governments . 
  and guess who sits in the council and is wielding the most power in the eu lawmaking process ... 
  this . 
  most of the `` democracy deficit '' is due to the power of the council . 
  when the national heads of state make decisions - often behind closed doors - in the council , that is n't really `` the eu '' deciding . 
  yeah , eu & efta are so hard to tell apart ... ( even eea is a lot more than a free trade zone ), 
  come on already , let 's build that postnational superstate !, 
  yeah , funny how the use of contraception and nonviolent parenting are correlated with education and intelligence . 
  if by `` you guys '' you mean the entire population , then yes . 
  if you only mean ` white ' people , `` ethnic germans '' or similar bullshit , then fuck you . 
  if you ca n't raise children without employing violence , you should n't have children . 
  then you still do n't fucking hit children , it 's really not that hard . 
  racisty got ta shut the fuck up, 
  sure , i 've got a few recordings that i treat the same way . 
  ( i.e. 
  : beethoven , symph . 
  if you 're into jazz or classical music , there a lots of well-done flac/ape-rips out there ( with scanned booklets and all ) . 
  even if you own the cd , it 's usually quicker to torrent the files rather than rip them yourself ... 
  hdd space is cheap , you can always transcode to a lossy format if you need smaller files for mobile devices . 
  https://kat.cr/beethoven-symphonies-nos-4-6-9-bernstein-in-vienna-t10475782.html you 're welcome . 
  i guess i should have called them red seats to be clearer . 
  the uk wants certain changes , mainly rolling back past integration steps while the ez states are interested in very different changes . 
  since the uk is comparatively insulated from the euro crisis , they are in an extremely advantageous negotiating position if the other member states see themselves forced to change the treaties to stabilise the eurozone . 
  the ez have been trying to get by without treaty changes so they do n't have to give in to british demands . 
  that 's one of the reasons why we 've been doing things like this lately : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_resolution_mechanism, 
   i simply believe that democracy is a tool to yield good results and that the nordic countries are indisputably the best countries in the world . 
  ranking things by quality without defining a metric is meaningless . 
   the world would be a far better place if everywhere outside of europe had remained a colony to the present day . 
  either you know nothing about the history of colonialism ( in which case you would still be a complete idiot for making that statement ) or you are a complete lunatic . 
   unfortunately , the us and global elite control everything and will fuck over anyone who tries to reduce poverty and institute social democracy . 
  the usa forced putin into power by looting russia and they 're well on the way to giving golden dawn the reins in greece . 
  i do n't even ... 
  why ? 
  i just want to go to art school . 
   is that 90/179 for the right of centre versus 85/179 for the left of centre then ? 
  the rates are secondary , a common standard for what constitutes taxable incomes & assets is far more important . 
  sf had 17 % of the red blocs seats , df has 41 % of the blue bloc now . 
  df should have far greater influence on policy than sf had , we 'll see if they put their emphasis on their supposed social policy goals or on immigration - and eu-politics . 
  i presume that the bbc is a good enough source for you . 
  i chose to adopt u/30052015 's level of hyperbole . 
  you are of course right that the uk is n't the only member state that is enabling corporate tax avoidance and furthering tax competition between the member states but if we 'd manage to strong-arm the uk into accepting common standards and limits for corporate tax rates and for determining what constitutes taxable assets & incomes , the other ( smaller and less influential ) offenders might take the hint . 
  or , in the hyperbolic version : if we make an example of you , the others will hopefully fall in line . 
  troll or lunatic ? 
  it 's one of the great mysteries of our time . 
  does n't that depend on who exactly he means by `` the media '' . 
  state tv seems pretty fair . 
  and relatively few immigrants live there so it 's especially easy to be afraid of them . 
  yeah , we 'll see about that once they 're in power again . 
  plus 4 left seats overseas ( 2 in greenland , 2 on the faroer islands ),
