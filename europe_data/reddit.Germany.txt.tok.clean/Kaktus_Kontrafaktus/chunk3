  i 'm sure there 's a bible somewhere between all those layers of fat ... 
  obviously , the british `` powers that be '' are your government , so we would seem to agree . 
  the tories and ukip want to renogotiate the four freedoms !, 
  i rather doubt that they 'd agree to a transfer union . 
  i 'm all for a transfer union , i 'd even advocate for a common european welfare state ( supplementing the national system , not replacing them ) . 
  we 'll make an example of you and then we 'll wait a bit to see if they fall in line ... 
   you mean like the eurozone ? 
  the uk has no involvement in that area . 
  the eurozone is based in the eu treaties which we ca n't change without the uk 's consent , the uk is very much involved . 
  the uk is however comparatively insulated from the consequences of a collapse of the eurozone . 
  if the ez states wanted change the treaties to stabilise the eurozone , they 'd have to agree to all of the uk 's demands to avoid a veto and the uk has lots of demands at the moment . 
  well , the idea of combining liberal social democracy with fascism is quite ... * interesting * . 
  i have to hear him out though , seeing as i 'm an ultra-egalitarian collectivist libertarian myself . 
  interesting source , thanks for the links !, 
  fucking depressing is what it is . 
  edit : to clarify , the results for df ( and them getting into power ) are what 's depressing me . 
  it 's not just a voice , it 's a veto . 
  the eu is in a structural crisis and having to cater to the tories who are catering to ukip voters is hugely detremental . 
  the sooner the brits have their referendum , the earlier we can have a serious debate about the future of the eu treaties ( either without the uk or with a uk that 's actually committed to the european project ) . 
   i do n't think you actually know what the nazi government was elected on ... do n't you know ? 
  the nazis where were totally pro-immigration .

  you 're getting more delusional by the comment ... 
  i 'm only advocating for a brexit if the uk government keeps their foot on the brake like they 've been doing in recent years . 
  i have a lot of ideas about where i 'd want the eu to go ... 
  predicting the actual outcome would be quite a task . 
  we get to find out  where the eu goes without british vetoes as i said . 
  right ... 
   you say that as though it 's just the uk stopping integration . 
  there you go again putting overgeneralisations in my mouth ... 
  the uk is the 2nd/3rd largest member state ( by gdp/population ) and definitely the staunchest opponent to political integration among the larger members . 
  i 'm mainly concerned with the current british powers that be standing in the way of political integration . 
  as long as the tories are catering to the ukip voters and the `` city '' at every turn , the referendum could n't be soon enough for me . 
  and they say germans ca n't recognise humour ... 
  i 'd be okay with a tunnel to canada , as long as the canadians keep the [ typical ` muricans ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-li5h8dl9sdw/ueubhifu7ti/aaaaaaaaaas/bh778cdvdwk/s1600/murica.jpg ) off the trains . 
  can we just take some time apart , see where the eu goes without british vetoes and then decide if we want to get back together ? 
  why ? 
  i 'm rather glad that we have an ocean-sized moat between us and ` murica ... 
  they could just build a pipeline next to the tunnel while they 're at it .

  too bad they 're not upgrading the entire hamburg-k\u00f8benhavn line to a true hsr level ( 350kmh should be doable , we do have the trains for it after all ) . 
   pledge of loyalty and cultural respect to social democracy , the welfare state , and public secularism and should keep religion a private , apolitical matter . 
  perhaps , if the contents of that pledge can be agreed upon by * every single citizen * . 
  that 's quite a strong statement , seeing as you do n't seem to know much about the things you 're talking about . 
   if you reject them , that does n't guarantee that they wo n't sneak back into denmark somehow , or a different european country .

  but muh retribution !, 
   travel , meet europeans that share your curiosity . 
  fall in love , fall out of love and repeat again and then ... and make babies , glorious supranational babies . 
  nonsense . 
  in a war with russia , germany would be a nuclear wasteland long before russian troops get anywhere near our borders . 
  if anywhere , troop build-up to deter possible military aggression by russia only makes sense along the borders between russia and the peripheral nato states . 
  you could argue for german military presence in the baltics ( for example ) but many of the cold war era bases in germany are just obsolete . 
  when 's the brexit referedum again ? 
  not far enough, 
  still , that 's no reason to vote df into power . 
  ] ( https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/trine_bramsen#kritik ) well , fuck her . 
  sorry about that , our balance of stupid has been shifting towards a surplus these last years so we 've started dumping excess stupidity over the borders . 
  i fucked up the title , it 's an x-post from / r/denmark , obviously . 
  well , fuck . 
  ( edit : since some people seem to use this comments up - / downvote count as an opinion poll on the election results : feel free to join in ), 
  but the alternative would be near-certainly part of the red bloc while df would be near-certainly part of the blue bloc ... 
   why ? 
  that seems rather idiotic ... ftfy, 
   i 'm sure they 've done their best yes , but we do n't know yet their best is good enough . 
  the blue bloc may well have won but we ca n't be certain of that yet . 
  edit ( 00:01 ) : well , it 's certain now . 
  both exit polls and extrapolated prognoses are based on statistical models , if there are significant differences between exit polls and prognoses , that 's a sign that the underlying models are somewhat off ( one or both of them ) . 
  * tv2 prognosis : 83/92 * dr prognosis : 85/90 * exit poll : 87/88 i would n't rule out 87/88 just yet . 
   should correct for historical regional differences you can correct for historical differences but newly emerging differences ( due to newly established parties or newly emerging issues ) are hard to predict . 
  both exit polls and extrapolated prognoses are based on statistical models , if there are significant differences between exit polls and prognoses , that 's a sign that the underlying models are somewhat off ( one or both of them ) . 
  confirmed by whom ? 
   also , we 're already known as the ` racist scandinavian country ' anyway , and who cares ? 
  the danish racists probably do n't ... 
  do n't give up yet , the prognoses will probably swing back towards the exit poll results when all the votes from the larger cities are reported ( it looks like aalborg , aarhus , odense & k\u00f8benhavn are lagging behind in the reporting ) . 
  i 'd still expect the final results to be quite close and pretty similar to the exit polls . 
  it seems like the urban districts are lagging behind in general . 
  i 'd guess that the extrapolations will swing back towards the exit poll results when the votes from aarhus & k\u00f8benhavn are reported completely . 
  when are the official result usually published ? 
  is there information on how many votes from which districts are reported yet ? 
  but it 's most probably a biased sample , it 's in no way comparable to the kind of representative samples that are used in social science . 
  you ca n't force the actual constitutional referendum ( and you need a majority in the folketing in addition to the referendum anyway ) but it looks like the process can be started through a referendum forced by a minority . 
  a decent majority in that initial referendum would probably make the folketing majority think twice before they reject the idea . 
  i 'm aware that the exprapolations are based on predictive statistical models but there 's a lot of possible variation in those . 
  if , for example , the voter movement patterns in rural and urban districts diverge , extrapolation models based on non-representative early vote counts can be way off . 
  these models are based on established patterns of national voter behaviour , if there are new prominent factors ( new parties , new important issues ) it 's hard to adjust them in time for the next election . 
  ( i study poli sci with an emphasis on quantitative methods & statistics ) the large divergence between the dr & tv2 extrapolations ( especially early on ) is a fairly clear sign that the currently used models are n't too trustworthy . 
  edit : the difference between exit polls and extrapolations seems very large , i 'm used to far closer results in germany . 
  yeah , i got that mixed up in my head ( already corrected ) . 
  edit : is there a usual pattern in the prognoses based on partial vote counts ? 
  it does n't look good for the red bloc in the current extrapolation but that may be because blue-leaning districts are overrepresented in the current partial count . 
  do you know how close the exit polls usually are in denmark ? 
  the latest forecasts are 85 ( +2 / 3 ? ) / 90 ( +1 / 2 ? ), 
  ( dr ) and 83 ( +2 / 3 ? ) / 92 ( +1 / 2 ? ), 
  ( tv2 ) for red/blue while the exit poll was 87 ( +2 / 3 ? ) / 88 ( +1 / 2 ? 
  ) , if the republicans win the seat they may well become kingmakers . 
  it 's republicans ( probably red , if the red bloc agrees to more autonomy for faroer ) vs social democrats ( certain red ) for one of the faroer seats , right ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , as far as i can see you 'd just need a bill to give the h\u00f8jesteret judicial review powers ( concrete & abstract ) introduced into parliament and the support of 1/3 * of the folketing to get a referendum , right ? 
  * or is there a different threshhold for bills to change the constitution ?
