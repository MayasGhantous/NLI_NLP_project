  edit : here 's translation of the relevant part of the constitution ( [ source ] ( https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/denmark_1953.pdf ) ) :  ** when the folketing passes a bill for the purposes of a new constitutional provision ** , and the government wishes to proceed with the matter , writs shall be issued for the election of members of a new folketing . 
  if the bill is passed unamended by the folketing assembling after the election , the bill shall within six months after its final passing be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection by direct voting . 
  rules for this voting shall be laid down by statute . 
  if a majority of the persons taking part in the voting , and at least 40 per centum of the electorate has voted in favor of the bill as passed by the folketing , and if the bill receives the royal assent it shall form an integral part of the constitution act . 
  1/3 of the folketing should be able to force a referendum on that bill , if it is rejected , right ? 
  are there exit polls for greenland & faroer yet ? 
  imho , the institutional setup of the danish political system is probably the best in the world ( from an egalitarian perspective anyway ) . 
  the only thing missing is a true constitutional court . 
  i wish germany would copy the danish system , you 're welcome to copy the bverfg in return . 
  well , ours is better than ftpt but if you get to choose , the scandinavian systems ( all very similar ) are the ones to copy . 
  multi-member districts * + leveling seats ** + open lists *** + low threshhold ( i.e. 
  2 % in denmark ) * i.e. 
  in denmark : 10 districts with 13.5 seats per district on average ( 2 for bornhold , all others between 10 & 20 seats ) . 
  ** i.e. 
  40 leveling seats in denmark , multi-member districts do n't distort the result as much as single-member districts . 
  pis & po do n't like competition , huh ? 
  yup . 
  as usual the scandinavians got it right . 
  the german system is at least less fucked up than ftpt but i 'm still jealous . 
  the thing is , if we adopted the scandinavian system ( multi-member districts + leveling seats , open lists , low threshhold ) , it might even be more proportional because we would probably have more seats per electoral district . 
   list pr is a terrible system tbh . 
  it provides no accountability to individual mps and often no regional representation . 
  mixed-member pr with multi-member districts and open lists fixes that ( practised in denmark , sweden & norway ) . 
   btw , have you ever voted differently on the party list and candidate ? 
  a new zealander told me that many people under their mmp system do that . 
  i like that about mmp . 
  since the german system has single-member districts , only the two largest parties have a realistic chance of winning constituency seats * . 
  the candidate vote is the choice of the lesser of two evils . 
  i usually end up voting for the spd candidate and the party list of one of the smaller parties . 
  the danish system does n't force you into tactical voting at all . 
  * spd & cdu/csu currently hold 294 of 299 constituency seats, 
  if you need a place to start : http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/democracy/~/media/pdf/publikationer/english/the%20parliamentary%20electoral%20system%20in%20denmark_samlet%20pdf.ashx 135 seats in 10 multi-member districts ( size varies ) + 40 compensatory seats ( to ensure proportionality ) . 
  the multi-member districts allow for regional representation ( without forcing people to vote tactically , avoiding the usual two party dominance in single-member districts ) without resorting to federalism . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plurality_voting_system ... yeah , i can see why . 
  still , if you ever get to choose , the danish system is the one to copy . 
  the multi-member districts allow for regional representation ( without forcing people to vote tactically , avoiding the usual two party dominance in single-member districts ) without resorting to federalism and the 40 compensatory seats ensure near-perfect proportionality . 
  german here , better take the danish one . 
  i 'd rather hammer nails into my ears ... 
  well , delegative direct democracy really has to be completelly public . 
  for vote delegation to make sense , the delegation chains need to be transparent . 
  you could of course have a parliamentary process ` in parallel ' . 
  every voter would have to decide whether to delegate their votes once every x years in secret or participate in the public delegation process . 
  since paper ballots ( that can be scanned for faster processing ) are still the only reasonably secure voting method , the secret delegation would probably have to be restricted to a set of candidates and could produce a parliament-like body . 
  so , the secret process could look just like the common practise in parliamentary democracies today . 
  yeah , we ca n't trust csu voters with direct democracy ... 
  yeah , i wish i could earmark my license fee to only fund arte ( and maybe 3sat & phoenix ) ... 
   he 's quoting karl marx . 
      `` religion is the opium of the masses . 
  it makes addictive and decadent . '', 
  or something among those lines . 
  no , nothing along those lines . 
  lots of people seem to know that quote , most of them have apparently no idea what marx is actually talking about ...  `` religious suffering is , at one and the same time , the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering . 
  religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature , the heart of a heartless world , and the soul of soulless conditions . 
  ** it is the opium of the people . 
  **  the abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness . 
  to call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions . 
  the criticism of religion is , therefore , in embryo , the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo . '',

   i 've never met a german person who defends german wine . 
  hey !, 
  there is some drinkable german wine out there . 
  ( you wo n't find it in a supermarket , though ), 
  [ not too famous but still ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_berwald ), 
  oh look at that , [ you were right !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35qzie/britain_took_in_more_migrants_than_17_other_eu/cr7k2aj ), 
   per capita is a pretty dumb measure . 
  no , it is n't . 
   what about population density ? 
  what about it ? 
  it really does n't ... 
  well-timed repost ... 
   destroy russia again ? 
  she/he probably thought you were a serb ... why do n't you flair up to avoid such misunderstandings ? 
   for some reason we 've let russia dictate that it 's theirs . 
  we should 've acted to ** stamp ** out that narrative long ago . 
  i do n't think we have the right boot for that ... 
  damnit , why do people keep downvoting you ? 
  sure , you write crap but it 's somewhat funny crap ... 
   people with different opinions to me are all bigots !, 
  she/he did n't say that that , get yourself a more convincing strawman !, 
   are you all eating krowki now ? 
  hopefully ... immigration has certainly benefited british cuisine ... 
  how is that not obvious ? 
   if the eu is so weak that it could break up if the uk leaves , it does not deserve to continue . 
  true . 
  a brexit might put a scoxit back on the table though , if the uk is so weak that it could break up if scotland leaves , it does not deserve to continue . 
  ( right ? ), 
  indeed . 
  ( is this like the intermediate step between upvoting and gilding ? ), 
   not counting xenophobia and patriotism ? 
  weird , i understand him just fine . 
  maybe you could try [ this ... ] ( http://www.majortests.com/sat/reading-comprehension.php ), 
  why the fuck would someone downvote that comment ??? 
  ^ ( ( and why the fuck are you downvoting me ? 
  / u/problemy 's comment was at -1 when i wrote this . 
   i think that you wo n't like what you see when we snap well , i can always emigrate , right ? 
   no we dont we 'll see about that ... 
  apparently , they were only `` protecting their native culture '' ... 
  i 'm glad to see that germany is at least comparatively welcoming to refugees .
