   is that a bet you 'd like to take ? 
  sure . 
   think denmark , think austria , think finland , ...  this will definitely open up the option of leaving the eu for populist parties all over western europe . 
  will it create political majorities for an eu exit ? 
  i rather doubt it ... btw : i 'm pretty sure that the eu will survive losing denmark , austria & finland ... 
  you 're not getting the point ... can you name * a single member state * that would actually change it 's mind about eu membership because of a brexit ? 
  of course britain might be considered one of the most ` relevant ' members , simply because it 's one of the most populous members but that does not mean that britain is necessary for the eu 's continued existence ... 
  i wonder how the uk would fare outside the eu ... a few years on their own might give the brits a well needed reality check . 
  i wish they 'd move up that referendum ... edit : to clarify , i do n't actually like the idea of a permanent brexit but i think the current crisis would be easier to solve without the british resistance to financial regulation and political integration . 
  i 'd like britain to fuck off for 5 years while we federalize and re-join when we 're done ... 
   if the uk leaves , consider that the end of the eu . 
  why ? 
  it 's not like the eu will collapse without the uk and the other 27 members ' reasons for joining it are n't exactly dependent on the uks contribution ... 
  is germany ( north west , not former gdr ) far enough west for you ? 
  yes ? 
  here you go then : ** get over your victimhood complex . 
  it 's been 26 years . 
  there go my vacation plans ... 
   all you non-believers will party in hell ftfy, 
   ** fact is ** , we germans and other countries like sweden or france are taking in ** way too much ** . 
  more than poland -  fact too much -  opinion, 
   in my opinion , we germans and other countries like sweden or france are taking in way too much . 
  it 's only fair , when the slavic countries finally start taking them in too . 
  ftfy, 
  see the mist in picture 4 ( and others ) ? 
  that 's not mist ... 
   ministers of chancellery ( schindler 's superiors ) , who claimed they knew nothing . 
  turns out they lied . 
  what ? 
  our politicians are lying to us ??? 
  if the toilet has good wifi coverage : fine by me !, 
   europe stronk !, 
  ftfy, 
  i would have thought proper german spelling would be mandatory for nazis ... 
   countries like sweden and germany desperately need a reduction in refugees . 
  no , we do n't . 
   i 'm saying we should n't destroy our own culture and society to pseudo-help refugees . 
  any culture that is n't compatible with basic human decency and solidarity ( like helping refugees and granting asylum to those who need it ) is no culture of mine !, 
   einmal wird unsere geduld zu ende sein , und dann wird den juden das freche l\u00fcgenmaul gestopft werden you know , i was n't going to go so far as to call you a nazi , but ... 
   lol , so much bullshit in such a short post . 
  it 's amazing . 
  yes , i do n't know how you always manage to do that ... 
   amnesty international sure did n't get to visit and photograph early nazi concentration camps . 
  ai was founded in 1961 ... 
  can we send you there instead ? 
   they 're absolutely swarming towards europe now , we have to think of our own survival . 
  you 're funny, 
  you think we - ( citizens of ) some of the wealthiest nations on earth - should n't help refugees from fucking warzones but i 'm the one with the `` messed up ideology '' ... 
   no we should not help refugees , there are simply too many of them . 
  300,000 a year in germany , over 50,000 a year in sweden . 
  german here , the current numbers are perfectly managable and they 're very welcome as far as i 'm concerned . 
  thank you !, 
  i wish i had more upvotes for you . ^ ^ have ^ ^ some ^ ^ gold ^ ^ instead !, 
  so ... a 2005 bordeaux or a 16yo lagavulin are girly drinks ? 
   they drink because they like the taste !, 
  their drinks do n't taste like shit !, 
  alright , let me get my broomstick ... 
  again ? 
  are you sure ? 
  lol germany better than sweden . 
  ( does that mean we can into nordic now ? ), 
  good to hear . 
  you 're very welcome here as far as i 'm concerned . 
  the [ `` they took our ~ ~ jerbs ~ ~ w\u00f6rk !,

  good point . 
  seasonal migration ( my choice : summers in copenhagen or amsterdam , winters in rome or haute-provence ) may be possible but few professions would allow for such a lifestyle . 
  get rid of erdogan and his ilk , then we 'll talk . 
  ( i 'm serious , it 's sad to watch turkish secularism wither ), 
  denmark , the netherlands or sweden ( in no particular order ) . 
  more precisely : copenhagen , amsterdam or stockholm . 
  liberal , egalitarian societies where you can get by pretty well with english and learning the local language as you go . 
  since i 've got family & friends in copenhagen & amsterdam ( plus , i live fairly close to both borders ) , i 'd have to decide whether to go north or west . 
  do n't worry , we just came into some empty plane seats , you can come with us . 
  our pilots are totally trustworthy , we promise !, 
  of course , i 'll fight for you until my ~ ~ last breath ~ ~ flight to south america starts boarding !, 
   surprise anschluss zoon !, 
  ftfy, 
  you mean we can into poland again * ? 
  oh the joy !, 
  i ca n't contain myself !, 
  ^ ^ * no ^ ^ anschluss ^ ^ this ^ ^ time , ^ ^ we ^ ^ promise !, 
  do n't worry , they 'll keep you safe until the dutch tanks get there , 
  no , changing the autopilot target altitude is quite hard to do unintentionally but it has do be doable quickly in case of depressurasition . 
  here 's what the relevant controls on an a320 look like : http://www.fscockpit.eu/data/images/fcu01.jpg to start a steep descent , you would have to : * spin the rightmost knob to set the new target ( with the selector set to 1000ft intervals , this could be done fairly quickly but hardly by accident ) * pull the rightmost knob * hit the exped button if it was just one button , it would never be designed to set the altitude target so low ( at least 10000ft or a higher , preset minimum safe height ) . 
  because you need to be mentally ill and muslim to be called a terrorist without any additional information . 
  muslim perpetrator -  because muslim !, 
  ( and crazy ) non-muslim perpetrator -  because crazy !, 
  ( and non-muslim ), 
  the plane was above the french coast between marseille and toulon at the time . 
  the descent ( from 11.5 km to 2km ) from there was ~ 145km long , the following cities ( pop  100,000 within city limits ) are within 150km of the start point of the descent : * marseille * nice * montpellier * toulon * n\u00eemes * aix-en-provence, 
  did you bring some sauce ? 
  [ anschluss does not work that way !, 
  you must forgive them , their brains are n't getting as much blood as they should right now ... 
   i do n't wan na start a conspirationnist stuff here then do n't ...

  did you save the image ? 
  i 'd guess that the school had arranged for transport from the airport to their home town . 
  travel time would be ~ 80min by train or ~ 60min by car . 
  i 'd expect the school to rent a bus to ferry the pupils from the airport to the school and have the parents pick them up there ( that 's how my school would have done it ) .
