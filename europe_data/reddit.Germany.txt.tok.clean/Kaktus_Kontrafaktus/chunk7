  here 's the cloud coverage at the time ( 10:30 cet ) : http://i.imgur.com/8vnlbmn.png ( red dot at the crash site ) there was dense coverage to the north-east of the crash site but not along the flight path and to the north . 
  hard to believe that they would n't have known where they were . 
  i do n't know about the crew but d-aipx flew above the same area [ two days ago ] ( http://www.flightradar24.com/data/airplanes/d-aipx/#5d031e7 ) , it 's the normal flight path for flights from barcelona & palma de mallorca to d\u00fcsseldorf ( and afaik to most other german airports ) . 
  edit : the area gets quite a bit of flight traffic : https://i.imgur.com/auychvg.jpg edit : ~ 50 of the last ~ 60km of the [ flight path ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7miajbe.png ) are parallel to the durance ( between pertuis and sisteron , the a51 runs along the durance ) . 
  with little knowledge of local geography , the durance valley would be the obvious choice if you 're looking for some land to crash on . 
  here 's the cloud coverage at the time ( 10:30 cet ) : http://i.imgur.com/8vnlbmn.png ( red dot at the crash site , [ here 's the flight path ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7miajbe.png ) ) there were dense cloud north-east of the crash site but along the flight path and towards the north , there should n't have been any issues . 
   yet the aircraft kept on flying straight ahead since the distress call at 10:45 probably rules out pilot/copilot being unconscious : would there be any reason to continue straight ahead other than losing all flight controls ? 
  even a slight course correction towards sisteron ( following the durance valley ) might have been benificial .

  i just ca n't take that site seriously when they write shit like this ( from a related article ) :  [ of course , when britain quits the eu and the whole system shrinks to 10 nations or groups of nations -- as the trumpet has forecast for years -- germany would not oppose a grand sweeping plan to create an eu army . 
  it would probably lead the charge . 
  but in the meantime , it will work on forming its own alliances , arrangements that will give the nation extra clout if the eu creates a new force .

   what is the rule which makes something local news ?

  [ the best source for tonnage i could find ] ( http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/pdfs/world%20port%20rankings%202011.pdf ) dates from 2011 and warns :  note :  the cargo rankings based on tonnage should be interpreted with caution since these measures are not directly comparable and can not be converted to a single , standardized unit . 
  i wonder what a global ranking by market value rather than weight would look like ... 
  yep , hamburg fell behind antwerp during the `` great recession '' and is back in 2nd now . 
  that 's only containers though , when you include all types of cargo things get a bit more complicated ... on the channel route , bremerhaven ( 4th ) & felixstowe ( 7th ) are also worth mentioning .

  looking at the results of the swiss strategy ( bilateral agreements + `` autonomous '' adaptation ) , a deal that includes broad access to the single market without freedom of movement seems rather unlikely . 
  immigration / free movement was the most contentious issue in the swiss/eu bilateral agreements , too . 
  the swiss way of european integration ( bilateral agreements + `` autonomous '' adaptation ) is probably dead for good .

  on the other hand , france may well decide not to start a nuclear exchange with russia on behalf of polish independence . 
  once deterrence has failed , actually making good on those security guarantees may seem like a rather bad idea . 
  they 're called * pommes frites * , no tip for you !, 
  and what do you think extended deterrence * is * other than that `` we got your back '' promise ? 
  it only works if that promise is backed up by the credible threat of nuclear escalation . 
  direct deterrence is , extended deterrence is a different animal . 
   a group that opposes the salafists . 
  you mean [ these cunts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_defence_league#hogesa ) ? 
   the 20 odd b61 bombs that germany has on its territory does n't give it a credible independent nuclear deterrent and it is but a drop in the pan when you appreciate that an icbm launched from montana can be on a target much faster than a shared b61 can even readied for use on a tornado in b\u00fcchel . 
  the russians do n't decide whether or not to attack germany on this basis . 
  things did look a bit different during most of the cold war : http://i.imgur.com/adysxif.png [ sauce ] ( https://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf ), 
  that 's not the point . 
  nuclear sharing is meant to increase the credibility of extended deterrence .

  7 of the un charta . 
  it might be cited as a justification but it does not provide a legal basis . 
  https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/assessing-legal-basis-uk-military-action-syria for comparison , [ here 's resolution 1386 which * authorised * the isaf mission .

  and tactical nukes that likely would have been used in any major confrontation ... 
  the constitution also prohibits the `` preparation '' of a war of aggression . 
  providing recon data for another country 's air strikes may very well count as `` preparation '' , some argue that providing * any * assistance to a war of aggression would count as preparation . 
   bombing syria would probably be legal since it 's not attacking syrian forces , so it 's not attacking syria but more helping syria . 
  france has invoked [ euv art . 
  42 ( 7 ) ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:12008m042&amp;from=en ) , that - if anything - would be the legal basis for any german military involvement . 
  the german constitution also prohibits the `` preparation '' of any war of aggression , which would very likely include aerial reconnaissance when it is used to aid airstrikes by other parties . 
  without a request for military aid by the syrian government , there is no legal basis for claiming to `` help syria '' .
