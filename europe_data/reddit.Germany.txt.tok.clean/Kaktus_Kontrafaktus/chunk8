  the tornados in question are specialised for aerial reconnaissance : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taktisches_luftwaffengeschwader_51  they 'll add no value to an alliance of a-10 's , pak fa 's and so on . 
  the a-10 's are hardly more modern than tornados and the pak fa 's are n't even in service yet ( trial phase ) . 
  britain and italy have sent tornados too and russia is mainly using su-24 's & su-25 's . 
  can we be a bit more strategic ? 
  let 's take the relevant urban agglomerations ( randstad , hamburg , copenhagen/malm \u00f8 ) , the ports ( antwerp , rotterdam , bremerhaven , hamburg ) and the hinterland in between .

  sorry , no euromonies for you . 
  the far right of the german political spectrum has found an issue to rally around . 
  the parties & organisations to the right of the cdu/csu have long been quite fragmented and busy with infighting . 
  even if the current situation was n't considered `` exceptional circumstances '' ( which it would be ) , germany could take on ~ 80-135 billion $ ( depending on gdp growth & inflation ) of new debt over the next 3 years without breaking the compact . 
   that just makes the movement seem stupid not just that . 
  many modern appliances do n't use three-phase anymore but most homes still have the sockets . 
  sure . 
  or we could pick the one that most people are using already ...

  the swiss plugs are no more incompatible to cee 7/7 than the danish plugs , they * are * however more compact . 
  they are for 230/400v three-phase , they 're used in homes too . 
  you 'll often find the more compact [ perilex plugs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perilex ) ( same 230/400 three-phase ) . 
  are you sure you do n't want to join the schuko master race ? 
  2nd phase , two 120v phases with one rotated by 180 \u00b0 gives you 120v between phase & ground or 240v between phases . 
  i 'm pretty sure our three-phase plugs have 5 prongs ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iec_60309, 
   i 'm not sure if any other countries are using 4 prong outlets ** yet ** . 
  nema 10/14 plugs are 120v split-phase ( 120v between phase & ground , 240v between phases ) , countries using 230v obviously have no need for that . 
  in europe , 5 prong plugs ( [ cenelec en 60309 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iec_60309#keying ) ) are common for industrial applications and for larger home appliances ( 230v between phase & ground , 400v between phases ) . 
  anything that fits cee 7/7 plugs ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schuko#/media/file:europe_plugtypeinuseupdate.png,

   ** outra ** - european what ? 
  even if rotterdam actually ran out of handling capacity , why go through limerick rather than one of the other channel ports ? 
  under the dublin regulation , a member state may make use of the `` sovereignty clause '' to voluntarily assume responsibility for processing asylum applications for which it is not otherwise responsible under the criteria of the regulation . 
  that 's what germany started doing in august 2015 , germany never ` cancelled ' or ` suspended ' the dublin regulation . 
  hungary , in the other hand , did * actually * refuse to apply dublin : http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-austria-hungary-idukkbn0p31zb20150623,

   new figures from the swedish national council for crime prevention show that ** 480,000 swedish women ** were sexually assaulted in 2015 . 
   ( ... )  in a new study , ** three percent of women ** say they were subjected to some form of sexual offenses in 2015 . 
  the corresponding figure last year was just under two percent . 
  there are 4.92 million women in sweden ( of all ages ; [ sauce ] ( http://www.scb.se/en_/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/population/population-composition/population-statistics/aktuell-pong/25795/yearly-statistics--the-whole-country/26040/# ) ) , 3 percent of that would be ~ 147600 , where in fuck are they getting the 480,000 from ?

  ` europe ' is n't making anyone vote again , the swiss government has been looking for a way to implement the [ 2014 referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_immigration_referendum,_february_2014 ) in a way that does n't trigger the guillotine clause of the [ bilateral agreements with the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/switzerland%e2%80%93european_union_relations#treaties ) but they 've come up short . 
  especially since the brexit referendum , there is little room to renegotiate the agreement concerning freedom of movement , almost certainly not enough to implement the referendum . 
  do n't forget , the bilateral agreements were approved by referendum in may 2000 by a fairly wide margin ( 67.2 % vs 32.8 % , 48.3 % turnout ) while the 2014 referendum succeeded by a very narrow margin ( 50.3 % vs 49.7 % , 56.6 % turnout ) . 
  would you like some help with that ?

  the state aid rules are part of the single market regulations , a nearly identical set of rules applies to the eea . 
  any agreement that gives the uk access to the single market post brexit will very likely contain such rules too .

  if it was up to me , allowing scotland ( and northern ireland , if they so wish ) to hold another independence referendum and respecting it 's result would be a mandatory part of any post-brexit agreement between the eu and the uk .
