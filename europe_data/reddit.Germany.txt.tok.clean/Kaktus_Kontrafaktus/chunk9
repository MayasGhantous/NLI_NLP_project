  with britain 's future after a brexit uncertain , foreign investment would drop - at least for a while - and demand for the # would drop accordingly . 
   we 'll give you london since you always had a thing for it . 
  we 're planning to relocate a good part of it 's economy to frankfurt anyway , i guess we might as well take the whole thing ...  but we get wales ... for bale reasons . 
  why ca n't you just admit that it 's their sexy sheep that you want ?

  yeah , having the financial center of the eu outside the eurozone is bad enough , having it completelly out of reach of european regulatory policy would be unacceptable . 
  joining you guys on every stupid military adventure does not constitute relevance . 
  i like you . 
  wan na build a postnational superstate together ? 
  they can ask nicely , that 's about it . 
   a stupdi decision yes , very stupdi indeed . 
   bringing german domination of europe to an end you fucking moron , the eu is your best chance of permanently preventing a german domination of europe . 
  while germany 's population size and economic importance in europe makes it the most influencial single nation in the eu , embedding its potential political power in european institutions ensures that it can always be outvoted if it 's neighbour feel the need to curtail it 's influence . 
  the deeper germany is integrated in european political and economic institutions , the higher is the cost it has to pay to exsert power unilaterially , in conflict with these institutions . 
  obviously , germany profits immensely from european integration but that profit is mainly economic and dependent on cooperation with it 's neighbours . 
  a breakup of the eu would weaken germany economically ( along with the rest of europe ) but would only strengthen germany 's ability to exsert ` hard power ' unilaterally . 
  tl : dr : if you think the eu enables `` german domination '' , you 're a deluded moron . 
  i do n't think we have a real disagreement here , what i 'm arguing is that what the spanish central government will try to avoid is setting a precedent for a newly independent state ( gaining it 's independence from a current eu member state ) getting eu membership ** without ** the consent of the member state it seceded from . 
  this would have been the case if an independent scotland would have been considered a `` remaining entity '' alongside the ruk after it 's independence from the uk because the ruk would not have been able to veto it 's eu membership . 
  this would not be the case if scotland were to be considered a `` remaining entity '' after a scoxit ** following a brexit ** because the ruk would no longer * be * a member state . 
  in that case , allowing scotland to remain in the eu could still require the consent of all eu member states , the ruk just would n't be one of those . 
  the first scenario would set a precedent for an independent catalonia remaining in the eu without spanish consent , the second one would n't ( as long as spain does n't leave the union ) . 
  of course , the spanish central government would consider catalonian independece to be ** un *** consitutional * . 
  yeah . 
  the snp probably has enough support for another referendum ( but they ca n't afford a 2nd failure ) . 
  the problem is that they were aiming for a sort of ` soft scoxit ' including close ties with the ruk ( i.e. 
  currency union , freedom of movement , close cooperation in education ) that could be scaled back over time . 
  that becomes much harder with the ruk outside of the eu , it 'll be more risky . 
  the scotish and english economies are highly integrated , having an outer eu border in between would be very disruptive . 
  the most central problem is probably the current oil prices , scotlands budget would depend heavily on oil revenues . 
  at the time of the scoxit referendum , those were quite high but with the current prices they would start out with a massive budget deficit ( or massive , possibly recession inducing , budget cuts ) . 
  printing their own currency would make it very hard to run a budget deficit , keeping the pound ( which - in principle - they could do without the ruk 's permission ) would leave them without any control over monetary policy ( and the ruk 's monetary policy probably would n't fit the needs of the quite distinct scotish economy ) and immediately joining the euro in the current situation is n't an attractive option either . 
  it 's a window they might regret missing but it 's not an easy chance to take ... 
  this term was coined ( for this context ) in the runup to the scoxit referendum . 
  the question then was whether an independent scotland would have to formally rejoin the eu ( which would have required them to go through the lengthy eu accession process - and could have been vetoed by the ruk ) . 
  consensus back then was that the ruk would have been considered the only `` remaining entity '' that would inherit the uk 's eu membership ( rather then both parts , in which case the newly independent scotland would have become ( / remained ? ), 
  a member state immediately ) . 
  if the leave campaign succeeds , the uk and the reu would start a 2 years negotiation process ( than can only be extended unanimously ) to determine their future relationship ( as set out by art . 
  50 of the lisbon treaty ) . 
  this would give scotland a window for another scoxit referendum before the uk would actually leave the eu ( unless the uk decides to leave straight away , without negotiating an agreement with the reu ) . 
  if that referendum was successful , this could enable scotland - as the `` remaining entity '' - to assume the membership role previously held by the uk . 
  the ruk , no longer being a member , would not be able to stop this if the remaining member states were in agreement . 
  this possibility has no concrete basis in eu treaty law as it stands but is not clearly precluded by it either . 
  in any case , the remaining member states could just agree to create that basis . 
  while the spanish government - fearing a precedent that could apply to catalonia - would have put up strong resistance against an independent scotland being considered a `` remaining entity '' that could retain eu membership against the ruk 's wishes , it has no reason to fundamentally oppose this possibility as long as it required unanimous agreement by the remaing member states . 
   upset that we 're leaving ? 
  if you 're happy to make stupid decisions , i 'm happy to wave you goodbye . 
  not too long though , i need that hand to welcome the republic of scotland in our glorious union ... 
  in case of a reasonably quick scoxit following the brexit , scotland might well be considered the `` remaining entity '' .

  or , more precisely , `` we 're not allowed to say it 's made in germany but there might be some german-made parts in it '', 
   or if it 's better  who knows ? 
  sure , i certainly would n't dare to claim that that could n't be the case inspecific cases . 
  especially given the difference in median wages , i 'd expect portugal to look rather different economically if the average portuguese production quality was higher than the average german production quality . 
  of course , the german concentration on specialized ` high-end ' products is n't due to some special innately german abilities but contingent historical legacy . 
  the value of the `` made in germany '' brand depends on more than current german production standards and a big part of that basis is quite irrational . 
  you might call this an unfair advantage for german industry ( and you 'd bei right ) but portuguese industry may ( on average ) still be better off producing stuff labeled `` made in germany '' than either a collective `` made in eu '' label or a more transparent `` made in portugal '' label . 
  like it or not , replicating the brand-value of the `` made in germany '' label would be a long & hard task and german companies are fighting to keep it ( while outsourcing parts of the production chain to remain competitive ) for good reason . 
   that could be the case if there was wide public awareness that `` made in germany '' could mean made in portugal . 
  but there is n't . 
  ** if ** the quality of portuguese production in whatever specific case ( ! ), 
  is exactly equal to the german alternative ( but probaly cheaper ) , than you are correct ( in that case ) . 
  ** if ** the quality of portuguese production in that case is lower to an extent that would be noticable to the customers but is labeled `` made in germany '' just as the superior but more expensive german production , then it will degrade the value of the label over time . 
  in this case , the liberal labeling of portuguese production as `` made in germany '' acts as a `` subsidy '' of portuguese production ( which can command higher prices due to the label ) by german production ( which is responsible for the value of the label and becomes less economically viable as the value of the label degrades ) . 
  in either case , i 'd be in favour of more detailed and transparent labeling because all these undesired effects are caused by market intransparency ( to the customers , who base their decisions on labels that are in either case at best very imperfect predictors of general quality or any specific attribute of a product )  your governments would disagree , as would ours . 
  as shown by what have been their respective positions towards proposals to change the current rules . 
  there are more aspects to this topic ... 
   however , that success is being `` subsidized '' by portugal , in that the `` made in germany '' label is benefiting from portuguese manufacturing that should be contributing to the `` made in portugal '' brand . 
  you could just as well argue that branding largely portuguese-made products as `` made in germany '' dilutes the value of the label and acts as a `` subsidy '' of ( current ) portuguese production by ( past ) german production ( to the detriment of future german production ) . 
  i suspect both effects are present but which is - on balance - more important is hard to say without detailed statistics . 
  leica 's status symbol production is probably not a good example , most people who buy leica cameras are rich fools easily parted from their money . 
  if companies are willing to move a token-part of the production chain to germany just to get the label , raising the minimum size of that part will - to a point - incentivize them to move production from portugal to germany . 
  look , i agree with your demand but the outcome wo n't necessarily benefit portuguese workers or companies and might well have the oppisit effect . 
  the label is a marketing choice , if the product can be legally labeled `` made in germany '' or `` made in portugal '' and the manufacturer expects a `` made in germany '' label to result in better sales than a `` made in portugal '' label , that 's the one they 'll pick ... 
   forcing their overprice products down the throats of poor eu countries . 
  how exactly are we doing that and how does the eu help ?
