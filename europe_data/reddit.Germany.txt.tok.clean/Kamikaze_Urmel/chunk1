itt : #makeeuropestrongagain preparing my flamesuite , although i 'm not opposed to a stronger , more united europe . 
  i think my pig whistles !, 
  what you are delivering here is under all pig !, 
  if anyone is interested in the source : [ starting at 6:40 ] ( https://youtu.be/mzr5e8f3pme?t=6m40s ) sadly only in german without subtitles guys :(, 
  *** breaking news *** is just claimed responsibility for a spilled glas of milk in my kitchen ... 
  fun fact : if you lose your license two or more times in germany you are forced to get yellow numberplates . 
  you usually get your license back after a certain amount of time . 
  legally speaking germans do n't lose their license , they lose the right to drive . 
  speeding usually only leads to 1 or 3 months `` fahrverbot '' . 
  you have to leave your license at the next police station , where you can pick it up after the time has passed . 
  a german driver who really loses his license has to reapply for it ( certain medical conditions and driving with to much bloodalcohol are 2 of several reasons for this to happen ) . 
  a license just for cars ( class `` b '' ) up to 3.5 tons usually costs somewhere between 1500 $ and 2000 $ . 
  ( if you fail often enough you could end up paying 5000 $ or more . ), 
  which would be the irish irs equivalent . 
  and i 'm quite sure they would be veeeeery excited to get that money . 
  seeing it from that pov you 're probably right . 
  there is alo more to this than just `` take the money '' . 
  in terms of fairness * they should take the money . 
  * it 's only fair for the irish citizen . 
  they have to pay taxes , so companies should also pay their taxes ... 
  in that case we should agree that we both ca n't agree in this case . 
  just because you do n't understand someone does n't mean he ca n't be funny . 
   on top of that your man obviously does n't have a slightest idea that addressing the irish president in such circumstances has more less the same effect as addressing a leprechaun as both have the same power in the matter of taxes he is well aware of that , germany has a quite similar political system in place , it 's part of the whole satire . 
   and that there is no such mechanism in european regulations that would allow a country to be fucked off the eu , be it hungary or ireland . 
  again , he is well aware of that fact , it 's - again - all part of the satire he is doing . 
  just for context : his party `` die partei '' is doing similar over-the-top-absolutely-unrealistic on regional levels . 
  : party for employment , constitutional state , animal protection , promoting the elites and basical democratic principles ) it 's hard for non-germans to understand his satire . 
  he is using basically using everything the german language offers him to express what he wants to express . 
  ( verbally and in written form . ), 
  i think you 're not getting his point . 
  he is criticizing the irish decision to basically gift apple a shitton of money by not collecting those taxes , meanwhile the irish citizen have to pay their full taxes without any exceptions . 
  his critique is aiming for irelands decision to be a country `` for the corporations '' , and not a country `` for the people '' . 
  i assume the whole meaning just got lost in translation . 
  german satire is very dependent on the speakers delivery and gestures . 
  just because you * started * `` speculating about things you have no idea about '' , does n't mean you should * continue * doing it . 
  and * thats * the point where you start speculating about things you have no idea about .

  it 's indeed a german export plate . 
  from `` starnberg '' to be precise . 
  a quite wealthy town south of munich . 
  according to reports many of the soldiers thought it was a drill/training maneuver . 
  ah , i see what you want to say , i may did n't express myself clearly enough . 
  erdogan knew he would need a reason to expand his powers , and he knew how . 
  juli 2016 '' . 
  `` 2745 judges , 5 members of the `` high council of the judges '' ( no idea what the actual translation is ) , and several state attorneys have been fired today , all of them have investigations against them since today . '', 
  would you have said the same about hitler ? 
  i 'm not alking about his failed coup in the 1920s , but the reichstagsbrand in the 1930s , which ultimately allowed him to expand his powers . 
  i know that erdogan is n't an idiot . 
  and thats exactly why he would do it this way . 
  he learned from history . 
  there are plenty successful coups and failed coups . 
  he just had to take a look at the failed ones and orchestrate one very similar to those . 
  lets list the thing which make this a very suspicious coup : * it started around 22:00 on a friday evening in only ( ! ), 
  2 big cities . 
  thats an odd day and time for a coup , is n't it ? 
  why would you start your coup when many people are still awake and possibly outside of their homes ? 
  would n't that be bad for a quick coup ? 
  would ' t it be better to start your coup on a monday morning ? 
  like 4.30 am ? 
  when most of the civilian people are still asleep ? 
  * why would you leave the person you want to overthrow run around `` in the wild '' without any attempt to capture or kill him ? 
  thats literally `` coup 101 '' . 
  cut the snakes head of before it bites you . 
  * the whole thing just happening in 2 mayor cities with 2500-5000 soldiers in total , most of them conscripts ? 
  young , unexperienced soldiers , cannon fodder so to say . 
  * the muezzin ( the mosque people ) calling people out for prayers at unusual times , and also telling them to `` support '' their president , to stop the military . 
  interesting , they [ muezzin ] are basically the ones who would profit from a non secular state , which erdogan wants to establish . 
  he went all in , with a royal flush in his hands . 
  i read several numbers about how many turkish soldiers were inlvolved and most of those numbers floated somewhere around 2500 and 5000 . 
  thats merely enough to start a coup in a country as big as turkey . 
  with such low numbers you are in no position to get anywhere close to ending the coup successfully . 
  but this is n't a `` real '' coup . 
  a bloodless coup would n't be believeable , considering the current political situation in turkey . 
   but imagine the damage he would take if evidence would appear that he has orchestrated this . 
  there wo n't be any evidence left in a week . 
  not erdogan . 
  and thats the whole point of it . 
  to stage a `` convincing '' coup people had to die . 
  on both sides , otherwise it [ the fake ] would be even more obvious than it is now . 
  recent history has showns the parliament is okay with supporting missions . 
  considering there are currently plans to create combat search & rescue units within the bundeswehr * , germany could take care of supporting roles ( recon , csar , long range mortar/artillery support , logistics etc. ), 
  * iirc only the us and the brits are able to deploy csar units atm , but i 'm not very sure about that . 
  never did that . 
  but you might want to check edward snowdens leaked documents . 
  those were leaked before he went to russia iirc . 
  if you do n't believe those are real ( which is understandable to an extend ) you could also check your countries laws , or even the news , those laws tend to get some coverage , especially by technology focused news sites . 
  so russia is catching up to the western countries ? 
   banana inspectors seriously ? 
  there gets the dog in the pan crazy with all those wrong english oversittings ... 
  no , but since the internet became a thing , and more and more people who are involved in the counting process use the internet , information about `` wrong counting '' spread much quicker and much farther . 
  in political/campaigning speak that translates to `` gove 's father was a working-class scottish fisherman '', 
  common sense certainly is n't it . 
  so you suggest education should cost money ? 
  now you made me curious . 
  let 's try to compare german car related taxes to the dutch ones . 
  let 's use the following data to make a fair comparison : just taxes ( this excludes any payments made for car insurance ) . 
  since german taxes differentiate between `` benzin '' and `` diesel '' i guess we should compare a diesel and a petrol engine . 
  we use the fuel consumption data which is provided by the manufacturer . 
  ^ ^ ^ `` combined ^ ^ ^ consumtion '' * `` benzin '' : vw golf 6 1.2 litre tsi 105hp , build in 11/2009 , fuel : 5,7 l/100km , emission ( co2 ) : 134 g/km * `` diesel '' : vw golf 6 1.6 litre tdi 105hp , build in 11/2009 , fuel : 4,5 l/100km emission ( co2 ) : 119 g/km distance driven per year : 15.000 km german taxes ( excluding fuel taxes ) per year : * benzin : 52 $ / year * diesel : 152 $ / year fuel taxes ( including vat ) , using current prices : * benzin : ~ 749 $ ( 1l benzin : 1,36 $ , 855l total ) * diesel : ~ 441 $ ( 1l diesel : 1,13 $ , 675l total ) overall taxes : * benzin : ~ 802 $ / year * diesel : ~ 593 $ / year please keep in mind german taxes are designed to be favorable for diesel engines with high milage/year and benzin-engines for low milage/year . 
  diesel = long dinstance travelling , benzin = short dinstance travelling,
