  pro tip : apostrophe-s like in `` it 's '' , are typed with `` shift '' + '' # '' key , not '' \u00b4 '' . 
  on german keyboards at least . 
  no true scotsman fallacy ? 
  betcha it 's the same dog-spirit that made hitler attack russia . 
  since you admitted to being a privileged douche even in your username , i felt compelled to extend the same courtesy . 
  you need to get out of your douche safe zones more ... we 're fucking everywhere and have always been . 
  do n't even know how you got in here without paying your share of the demogeld , to be paid to antifa ev . 
  a daesh of beach ? 
  actually it 's a multi-action weapon , exactly how many pulls are required depends on the attractivity of my target ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  on a nudist beach ? 
  i mean i could try and shoot from my flesh cannon , but reloading takes far too long to fend off more than one . 
   staff at the freibad xantener s\u00fcdsee said they were forced to call the police after the men refused to stop abusing naked bathers at the resort , which is near the town of wesel . 
   the incident , which took place on wednesday , was not reported to german police until the following day . 
  what now ? 
  username checks out !, 
  at least it slightly amuses us . 
  we do n't call soldiers mentally ill , even though they 're volunteering to kill people and potentially be killed ; all for the idea of a nation ( or money , or adventure ) . 
  but yes , turns out most of the violent attacks recently were committed by people who had a history of mental illness . 
  maybe it 's the same in the middle east , and they just do n't have the means to be diagnosed ? 
  all of the victims were [ immigrants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_munich_shooting#casualties ) . 
   you reap what you sow . 
  i do n't think that 's accurate . 
  people do n't usually snap from not being made to feel like a native . 
  damn did the guy get an axe stuck in his helmet and continue fighting ? 
  nah , it 's travelling south-east , the trend is clear . 
  next one up is ... uh ... syria ? 
  well shit ... 
  does n't like jews all that much ? 
  `` male models '' was an older meme . 
  probably was n't funny even back then either tbh . 
  in correct english you 'd call it swabia , but i decided to call it as we do . 
  but why male models ? 
  `` endless '' being less than 1 % of our current population ? 
   singapore so we 'd just have to turn into a borderline dystopian society where every movement is controlled by cameras and the government stifles most forms of opposition ? 
  yep , and it * still * happened . 
  that 's not proof , but a hint that not all terrorism can be prevented by keeping out refugees and/or muslims . 
  cheers for bringing up the actual numbers !, 
  remember turkey is operating under emergency powers ; i believe the authorities are allowed to hold someone for up to two months before they have to open a trial ? 
  anyway , op 's link did n't tell me enough about wheter they 're actually being detained , or just not allowed to leave turkey . 
  by ( in their eyes , hopefully ) making european nations more cautious about intervening in these countries . 
  well they mostly fight for muslim countries to be free from western influences and from non-muslim minorities . 
  wheter that 's a positive of negative kind of `` freedom '' is up to you . 
  the terms `` freedom fighter '' and `` terrorist '' can almost always be used to describe the very same group , just from a different point of view . 
  plenty of people talking about that [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/5zwaq1/the_satanic_temple_puts_up_antipaddling_billboard/ ) . 
  they do n't ? 
  well that 's good to hear , colour me relieved . 
  ~ ~ true , but before you left eu , there was an additional layer preventing its reintroduction . ~ ~ edit : see [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/63ljzg/what_brexiters_want_after_brexit/dfvuncq/ ) comment . 
  the death penalty is bad , because * it is very difficult to be 100 % sure of someone 's guilt . 
  * it is impossible to resurrect someone you wrongly killed . 
  * it makes it harder to reopen old cases where someone was wrongly killed , because they themselves ca n't keep pushing * even when you get the right guy , the trial process to get there is pretty damn expensive ; probably even more so than when the stake is life in prison . 
  i know i 'd be exhausting literally every single opportunity . 
  * if you do away with all the appeals and what have you , it makes it easier to get an innocent , see 1 . 
  * give prisoners who 're on death row less incentive to behave ; once they are handed the ultimate punishment there 's not much more you can do , unless you want to also introduce different tiers of execution ? 
  like , hanging -  gassing -  shooting -  beheading -  stabbing -  dismembering -  breaking on a wheel -  drowning -  burning ? 
  * when someone knows they might get killed anyway , they might be less inclined to go along peacefully with police ; this might prolong a shootout/hostage situation and lead to more deaths , or make criminals fight harder . 
  all in all , a lot of drawbacks for just a small amount of satisfaction and perhaps security . 
  japan having it is not a good excuse to reintroduce it . 
  or certain regions of the us , like i recently learned on reddit ... 
  a few of those would have been stopped by the eu and its courts ( e.g. 
  death penalty ) . 
  ~ ~ now those ideas can be put into action ; that 's disconcerting to people who oppose them . ~ ~ edit : see [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/63ljzg/what_brexiters_want_after_brexit/dfvuncq/ ) comment . 
  however , yea , those numbers do n't seem all too troublesome . 
  / r/swoleacceptance would be all over that . 
  by calling in the americans to slap germany on the wrists ? 
  ah , memories of empire earth ... 
  yep . 
  that 's literally what i 'm laughing about . 
  i 'm also lauging about 9/11 jokes , about holocaust jokes , about rape jokes , what have you . 
  and you being sourer than kraut wo n't keep me from it . 
   many germans are butthurt about bombing of single city dresden there are some who want to use that incident to push their political agenda , but in general , no , we 're not butthurt about it . 
  you would n't get shit on for making a joke about it , at least . 
  turkey seems to have an expansive network of spies targetting their citizens abroad . 
  recently the german espionage agency bnd received [ a list ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/29/c_136165527.htm ) of possible suspects lin germany from the turkish mit . 
  the fact that a german politician was on this list caused some outrage . 
  i hesitate to wish anything bad upon others , but in this case him suffering a stroke would probably be the best outcome for all . 
  ewwwww, 
   it 's a superficial nationalism that appeals only to those who will talk endlessly about it but will not fight for it . 
  completely different from this subreddit 's habit of starting to sing the ode to joy at every opportunity \u00dc, 
  r e c l a i m, 
  is that hotel 's name really `` hatemogul '' ? 
  haha what , nomen est omen very much ? 
   also , why not deport at least some of them ? 
  i 'd assume they do , but i 'm not really sure . 
   holy shit , how did so many georgians manage to illegally enter germany anyway ? 
  the article mentions many so-called [ `` thieves in law '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thief_in_law ) ( i 'd never heard that before ) organize for poor georgians to come to germany and apply for asylum . 
  while not many are granted this ( the article says something about 0.3 % ) , it can take up to a year for that to be decided due to our understaffed/overworked bureaucracy . 
  then they 're told to leave germany . 
   1/4 would be way too much . 
  that 's what i thought , but the german police has more than [ 8k suspects ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/georgische-diebesbanden-in-deutschland-sippenhaft-fuer-ein-ganzes-land/13799998.html ) from georgia , while only a few ten thousand georgians live here . 
  seeing that other map of europe with which country imports mainly from were , they were n't wrong ... 
  is that the sound of the wind , or the waves ? 
  ukraine was seen as a provocation because the actual government was exchanged . 
  that 's a far cry from allowing visa-free travel . 
  i 'm saying we 're not `` expanding '' east ; if you count visa free zones as `` expansion '' ( which i would not ) then we 've already been further east than russia itself . 
  well we 've had countries way further east already . 
  this is certainly no expansion to the east ; germans have been able to travel to a total of 173 countries without needing a visa beforehand for quite some time now . 
  but your other point also worries me a bit ; last time i read a report on foreign crime , almost one quarter of all georgians in germany were suspects in a crime , mostly burglary . 
  it feels like the eu is surrounded by clowns in positions of power on all sides . 
  damn , for added irony . 
  what 're they gon na do , stab chocolate ?
