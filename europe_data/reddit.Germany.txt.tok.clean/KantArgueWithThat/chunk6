  that would be where nationalism starts , in my opinion . 
  for example , the celtic people in britain before the romans came are one group i have been reading about lately , and i do n't have any sort of ancestral connection to them ( that i know of ) . 
  hm , i 'm from the countryside , and our horror stories were mostly spiked drinks grade stuff ; being surrounded and groped by groups of guys is a new one . 
  it 's a pretty new thing to germany at least . 
  i do n't recall hearing that word even once before 2016 . 
  also lack of wind to blow the soot away . 
  yea but that 's the point - * i * pay for heating , while * someone someday * will pay for the health costs my coal and possibly trash burning will cause . 
  if my options are to freeze to death or possibly catch ( or cause for someone else ) lung cancer some time down the road , option 2 sounds a helluva lot better . 
  us germans should n't look down on people who have to make do with a lot fewer means . 
  i mean titlecringe aside , it 's a nice reminder of western history . 
  i like roman , celtic and german history , no nationalism required . 
  should n't we be focussing on the * change * in perceived security though ? 
  i 'm fairly certain the terror attacks of the recent months have led to a change in perceived safety . 
   do you think 9/11 did n't change the americans at all ? 
  on the contrary , i think the us overreacted after 9/11 . 
  the patriot act , invasion of afghanistan and iraq , mobilizing the entire population ... those were overreactions at best , mistakes at worst . 
  you 're right , i misread the first entry to be about union instead of cdu by herself . 
  i upvoted because i had a good chuckle that this even got so far as to be decided by the supreme court . 
  ~ ~ because the csu is [ what kept the cdu ahead of the spd ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundestagswahl_2013#wahlergebnis ) last election . ~ ~, 
  also swabians , do n't forget about us !, 
  culturally , we belong with baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  what gives you the impression that the future economic climate is a prime concern for terrorists ? 
   it is , but not for the countries of immigrants origin . 
  on the other hand , it seems like those countries often could n't even employ all their skilled workers , so if they did n't emigrate they 'd be stuck on welfare . 
  at least it would shut down blatantly made-up stuff . 
  like after a refugee raped and killed a young woman , folks posted an image of a german politician with the quote `` this young man has killed , but we now need to help him '' , allegedly quoted by the s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung . 
  only this quote was completely made up . 
  the politician complained to facebook , but they still took their sweet time shutting it down . 
  in the meantime this image has spread far and wide , reenforcing negative sentiments against this politician and her party . 
  think they did n't really switch off their fossile power plants , did they ? 
  it 's more like `` renewable sources produced enough energy to cover 100 % of our domestic usage '' . 
  i expect a kaiserlicher ritter to use his broadsword , though . 
  not a banana . 
  at which point can we go `` ah fuck it , it 's reichtangle time '' ? 
  username does ** not ** check out, 
  no , the [ apocrypha ] ( https://www.google.de/search?num=10&amp;hl=de&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=550&amp;q=skyrim%20seeker&amp;=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l= ) variant . 
  just do n't go russian in some random direction , or you might end up in ukraine . 
  so ... what can us southern germans do to help ? 
  does donating blood do any good ? 
  i 'm a registrated donor and currently outside of the `` cooldown '' between two donations . 
  or can we donate money towards the rebuilding efforts ? 
  fuck i just want to do something so i stop feeling so damn helpless . 
  well the last failed assailant hanged himself in his prison cell , but that did n't do us much good either . 
  we 'd wanted some intel from that piece of shit first . 
  did you have a stroke ? 
  the dutch just got three feet taller,

   `` in five years , could already be too late , '' he said what does that mean ? 
  holy shit just think of how much heat you can pack into a motorized wheelchair . 
  target system , recoil compensator , 1000 bullet magazines , multiple barrels ... 
  with your posts i can never really be sure what 's satire and what 's your actual opinion . 
  marshall-plan : [ 120 billlion dollars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) adjusted for inflation . 
  eu-structure fonds for middle/eastern europe : [ 350 billion euros ] ( http://www.gtai.de/gtai/navigation/de/trade/maerkte/dossiers/eu-foerderprogramme.html ) . 
  could n't find any numbers for the total amount of money that has been pumped into eastern europe . 
  til the war on christmas is real, 
  when i was 12 i was a bloody introvert who never left his house . 
  so my parents knew basically everything i did . 
  i mean , if the parents were involved they would be sent to prison in germany and the son would have to taken away and live in an orphanage . 
  once the parents are released , they 'd probably be sent home , and if the boy has n't reached 18 years by then he 'd have to accompany them . 
  this is all assuming the parents were the ones who put the boy up to this . 
  it 's an interesting question ; in that case we 'd probably send back his parents for trying to cause harm to germany , and since we ca n't separate a twelve-year old from his family , he 'd be sent along . 
  so , i worded it wrong , we would n't send him * back * , we 'd send him * there * . 
  should add that i do n't want this to happen at all , unless the parents really were the ones instructing him . 
  i mean , if his family supported him you could make a case they all should be sent back . 
  yep , i blame the parents , even without knowing any details . 
  i 'm judging them very fucking hard for not instilling a sense of right and wrong into the boy . 
  no read , only downvote, 
  not my pictures , but in [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/stuttgart/comments/2yfi40/someone_improved_the_look_of_campus_vaihingen/ ) post someone took [ these ] ( https://imgur.com/a/7w2vr ) [ photos ] ( https://imgur.com/ddljuno ) from the same building i am living in now . 
  certainly , but the csu is one of the main obstacles to marriage equality . 
  this is entirely bavaria 's fault . 
  folks downvoting you probably have never set a foot into bavaria . 
  god dammit ... 
  i refuse to weaponize memes , where do i flee to to dodge the general draft that has been instated on / r/de ??? 
  i 'd say america , but they just voted their most weaponized meme into office ... 
  i see . 
  the article i thought of was posted somewhere in a discussion about refugees , so i probably misremembered it . 
  if someone had to flee from their home in the ukraine and now can not build themselves a home in the rest of the country i 'd totally understand if they wanted to come to europe . 
  apparently poland was quite successful with giving out work visas to urkainian refugees . 
  will this cause many refugees from ukraine to flee to europe ? 
  thought i 'd read about several hundred thousand already living in poland . 
  we had mixed swimming lessons during classes 3 and 4 , ( maybe 5 too , ca n't remember ) , but after that they were definitely separated . 
  about that age the strength disparity between boys and girls really starts showing , so they probably did n't want girls to slow down their classmates when grading swim time . 
  interesting , my turkish friends all say the only reason erdogan is popular is because of the economic success under his rule . 
  i have n't heard about any of this , do you have any newspaper articles ? 
  no , it 's the other way round : there are terrorists entering the country as refugees , but keeping out refugees would n't entirely keep out terrorists . 
   many were taken in by local families . 
  i 'm fairly certain in the beginning houses were assigned to refugees by the government . 
  the united nations run several refugee camps around the world . 
  at least once they went around to the governments of this world begging for more aid , because people were * literally starving and freezing to death * in these camps . 
  it 's easy to forget about some poor souls stashed away in a lebanese internment camp . 
  it 's a lot more difficult to forget about them when they 're outside your window . 
  it was just / u/spez editing the dictionary, 
  the even weirder thing is apparently his family * did n't notice * him converting to islam . 
  i mean , his family is among the non-believers now !, 
  how can you twist your brain around like that without showing anything on the outside ? 
  that 's some real `` from paris with love '' shit . 
  it 's not just the military ; they also delivered some to the police . 
  their export licenses permitted them to deliver into provinces where the police seems to be mostly ok ( i.e. 
  not involved in organized crime themselves ) . 
  but recently some hk guns turned up in the hands of police departments that were not covered by their export permissions .
