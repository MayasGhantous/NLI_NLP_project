  the software i helped write was for managing company registrations in one of germany 's states . 
  they wrote a web-based system . 
  software must fit the regulations ( laws etc. 
  ) , what they use does not exist as commercial software !, 
  well-known example in the us : the website for `` obamacare '' . 
  it 's all custom-made . 
  and it 's even worse : in germany for example states develop their own version even if other states do the same . 
  i 'm not saying they do n't collaborate at all , but not nearly enough . 
  and the os is the least of the problems . 
  oh you are grossly mistaken they * do * get a lot of work done !, 
  just ask the lobbyists . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/lobbyists-european-parliament-brussels-corporate  30,000 lobbyists and counting : is brussels under corporate sway ? 
  from mobile phone charges to nations ' interests , these shadowy agitators are estimated to influence 75 % of european legislation, 
  soy does n't taste like meat . 
  soy `` products '' are just that , products . 
  with chemistry ( which is a neutral word , just a science ! ), 
  you can give anything any taste , especially if it did n't have much to begin with . 
  that is exactly my question - they do n't count as asylum seekers because they can get in more easily ? 
  if so number of asylum seekers for the uk can not easily be compared with other countries . 
  total immigration would be better . 
  i 'm just asking because i do n't know , but is n't immigration from [ commonwealth countries ] ( http://thecommonwealth.org/member-countries ) treated differently in britain ? 
  so your proposed solution is to make such trademarks meaningless , so competition will be based solely on price in the future - meaning the most shitty but cheap production wins ( in asia , known for its regard to environment and animal welfare ? ) . 
  coupled with the largest marketing budgets and departments , so big corporations win . 
  lack in taste will be compensated by the company 's top notch food chemists . 
  nestle or kraft mozzarella made in bangladesh ? 
  clever . 
  it works well with most us food after all ( i lived there for a decade , thank you very much ) . 
  it seems that they have not adopted the culture of their country . 
  so to me this ( their ethnic background ) is essential information . 
  same in germany : to me it 's quite different news when `` real '' ( do n't know how to say it better ) germans start similar fights we read about perpetrated by some immigrants ( who i * do * wish would just get work permits to get hem something worthwhile to do ) . 
  ** overview of tuition fees in germany ** ( as of feb 2013 ) http://www.mastersportal.eu/articles/358/overview-of-tuition-fees-in-germany.html it 's really low , and some of the fees are going to be canceled , as stated in previous articles . 
  also : http://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-germany some master programs at some universities cost quiet a bit . 
  but that 's just * some * . 
  did you read the article and the outrageous sums they are talking about ? 
  ( no you did n't , or you did n't care and just wanted to make your `` point '' regardless . ), 
  what ? 
  we never had a flag , nor did anyone i knew ( neighborhood ) . 
  there was no `` you must have a flag on your house '' rule . 
  what * could * be seen on almost every house was two antennas : one for east german tv/radio , one for west german stations . 
  clearly visible . 
  i do n't know anyone who was called out for that , it was obvious and ubiquitous . 
  the gdr was a rotten jail but it was n't north korea , not by a long stretch . 
  i lived in what now is the state of thuringia . 
  we never had a flag , and i do n't know anyone who did . 
  nobody cared . 
  i ( teenager ) went to the parades of course , but if someone did n't go unless they had a history of other digressions - and i do n't mean political ( that was very rare ) , just stuff that will get you in trouble * anywhere * - you may have been asked , and maybe * somebody * did n't like it ( there always are those people ) , but nothing severe would happen . 
  besides , it was a huge event , meeting people , eating delicious thuringian bratwurst - but i 'm talking 1st may parades here , i do n't think we had parades in october , i think that was held only in some places . 
  the vote is a joke - you can vote as many times as you want . 
  that website does not have any but the most basic ( cookie based ) protection against multiple votes . 
  since the `` pro '' forces here on reddit have been the loudest for weeks i 'm not surprised they are leading . 
  somebody pointed out lots of americans voted too - according to alexa half of reddit users are from the us , and for some reason this subreddit has * lots * of americans , as i noticed in many posts ( nothing wrong with that ) . 
  the problem is n't money , they spend plenty . 
  the problem at least for the germans is a * huge * bureaucracy tat mismanaged every single major project they started . 
  [ here are 6 big projects that cost a lot more than planned and failed to deliver . 
  ] ( http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/ruestungsflops-der-bundeswehr-totalschaden-mit-ansage/8232292.html ) [ google translate version ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.handelsblatt.com%2fpolitik%2fdeutschland%2fruestungsflops-der-bundeswehr-totalschaden-mit-ansage%2f8232292.html&amp;edit-text= ) so just throwing `` more money '' at the problem is about as stupid as trying to fix the us health care system with more money . 
  i hope but severely doubt they can get corruption under control . 
  i love the country , spend several months there ( east as well as west ukraine , cities like odessa or lviv are really nice ) , but ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_ukraine, 
   becoming a soldier in germany is no longer a very respectable choice of career , because history eh . . 
  what ??? 
  nobody cares about `` history '' , people care about the here and now . 
  there are plenty `` anti-soldier '' people in all countries , incl . 
  the us . 
  being a soldier is just another job . 
  but what is widely known in germany is that the bundeswehr is a really horrible , huge bureaucracy . 
  and the reputation suffered not so much from recent military actions but from the uselessness of them - politicians sending the bundeswehr to places like afghanistan and now they return and nothing has changed there . 
  the taliban are even coming back . 
  we could read articles in the spiegel about drugs being planted en mass and the bundeswehr could only look and do nothing . 
  the problem with reputation is 95 % with politicians and how they ( mis ) use the military , not with the soldiers . 
  by the way , i served ( battle tanks electronics and weapons systems mechanic ) . 
  never had a problem in uniform . 
  quite the opposite : getting home by hitchhiking was the reason to leave the uniform on and not switch to civilian clothing !, 
  one would always be picked up quickly in uniform , it took quite a bit longer as a civilian . 
  so i 'd say the image of soldiers in germany is pretty good !, 
  eh . . what ? 
  nothing i said changes in any way . 
  what is your point ? 
  you might as well have asked about the proverbial [ bag of rice in china ] ( http://feisar.de/stuff/breakingnews.jpg ) . 
  well * of course * they pay , nobody in business ever gives anything away , duh . 
  no new information , i stand by my reply . 
  do n't pretend that in this situation orb\u00e1n would not have known from the start that re-export to ukraine was n't in putin 's interest and that he needed a reminder . 
  i 'm not sure the claim of that `` friendship '' is supported by the fact that they must have started shipping to ukraine in the first place , or they would have nothing to `` halt '' now . 
  if he really was such a putin friend they would n't have done that to begin with i 'd think ? 
  to be fair , the article is clearly marked as `` opinion '' and is worth * nothing * more than any other reddit comment - and that opinion is n't exactly unexpected . 
  is there * anything * you can do that is n't re-interpreted by * someone * in a negative light ? 
  my take : the opinion piece author are wrong because because it 's one of those `` what if '' pieces . 
  `` but what if the sky was falling tomorrow ? '', 
  - those famous what-if questions reporters like to ask politicians . 
  what 's wrong with asking for volunteers ? 
  i 've served in the army . 
  they do ask for volunteers . 
  they 've always done that back to the very first skirmishes between tribesmen . 
  even in the cheesiest war movies do they ask for volunteers . 
  not to mention that the author seems to have zero medical background . 
  what 's the use of just sending people ? 
  when you 've read some of the interviews of people there and situation reports and projections without proper planning and preparation this is like sending troops into an already lost battle to be slaughtered . 
  in case you have n't noticed : they ca n't actually do anything about ebola . 
  they just try to manage something unmanageable . 
  they have to turn back lots of people at the gates to see them die in the streets !, 
  `` more personnel '' does nothing . 
  and then that full-of-himself journalist brings up an entirely unrelated subject to further show how `` embarrassing '' all of it is .
