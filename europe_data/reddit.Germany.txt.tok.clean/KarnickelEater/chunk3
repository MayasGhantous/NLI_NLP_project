  the only thing embarrassing is that article !, 
  he writes :  with its world-famous virology centers , germany is better placed than any other country to help wtf ? 
  of what use are those centers in germany for the sick in africa ? 
  he does not seem to call for them to be transported to germany , so why does he write that ??? 
  he does not like the minister . 
  okay , i get it , nobody likes her . 
  * she * may be an embarrassment . 
  but that has * nothing * to do with the issue the article is about , here that journalist is mixing his dislike of a person with an issue . 
  actually , just posting cat pictures would already be better than what you posted . 
  i like well thought out deep arguments , there 's sooo much to learn about this situation . 
  you do not honestly believe that * you * contributed any such thing ? 
   at the very very least we should increase our defense spending to 2 % of our gdp . 
  here 's my german response : f u. i would actually be willing to listen to thought-through expert arguments , but redditor armchair generals giving policy advice ... come on , you take yourself waaaayyyy too seriously . 
  congratulations - you one-upped yourself !, 
  now you sound even more silly , if that is possible . 
  all governments in your country - which i have visited several times ( east as well as western parts ) - have suffered from severe corruption at the very least . 
  how about you start cleaning up your own country before demanding great action - especially military one - from other nations ? 
  i 'd be much more open to help ukraine a lot more if i did n't suspect that 99 % of the help ends up in some very few ( private ) hands one way or the other , and that any action ( incl . 
  military ) ends up helping a few very rich guys most of all . 
  i 'd love to see ukraine in the eu and travel there even more often - but preferably with a different kind of government and less of a contrast between a few ultra-rich and a lot of extremely poor people . 
  speak for yourself - i.e. 
  for * your * country , you brave armchair general . 
  your most courageous action ( and those who think like you ) will be to downvote me . 
  big mouth , but neither brain nor brawns . 
   if the west had moved in destroyers , carriers , and nato troops to poland or kiev at the first move to annex crimea eh ... what ? 
  so they would have `` been there '' . 
  no change in outcome at all . 
  unless they actually attack - which means that , if they actually win russia will use nukes . 
  so unless you doubt that russia will do that , you can not actually attack . 
  it seems to me the only weapons are economic , period . 
  how i * hate * this talk of the armchair generals about bravely moving their troops to oppose russia ... seems like a well thought-out plan ( i.e. 
  making a lot of angry noises ) . 
  to add to this : without debt , there is no money !, 
  our modern money is debt . 
  someone 's debt is somebody else 's asset !, 
  money on a global scale has pretty much * nothing * to do with money on a personal scale . 
  gresham college lecture ( 1hr ) : [ humanity and a million years of sea level change - dr nicholas flemming ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-d74twjxwm&amp;list=uu1t6kkxobvjdr8m9kj2fx7a ), 
  i thought about adding `` i 'm not concerned food '' but thought it superfluous . 
  turns out it was n't . 
  as if food is the only ( potential ) problem !, 
  sure , it 's the only one most people * think of * . 
  i 'm actually not concerned about any of the problems we can think of . 
  the main issue to me seems to be that this is a completely new situation on this planet . 
  does not * have * to be bad or lead to a bad result ( for us , for most other species it does but as a human i have to say to them `` tough luck '' ) . 
  it 's - quoting rumsfeld - `` the unknown unknowns '' of the situation , coupled with less buffer than humanity ever had because there is nowhere else to go . 
  indigenous societies screwed up often enough , so they just moved on . 
  we ca n't , or only to a much more limited degree . 
  depending on who creates the statistics anywhere between 9 and 15 billion . 
  the point is : a lot of people . 
  heterosexual sex . 
  but why ??? 
  [ earth population ( of humans ) projected to hit 13 billion ] ( http://www.techtimes.com/articles/15945/20140918/world-population-s-growing-pains-study-predicts-13-billion-possible-by-2100.htm ) . 
  solution : more children ? 
  seems logical . 
  you do n't pay for the beer . 
  you pay for location ( in space and time ) . 
  according to physics/chemistry : [ surface energy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surface_energy ) is smaller on the larger spheres . 
  that means more and more atoms are going to migrate from the smaller to the larger ones to get to the lowest energy state . 
  source : [ i just finished a course ] ( https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-3-091x-introduction-solid-state-1751 ) . 
  there are a lot of other forces but it explains why when you have spheres of different in size the small ones will get smaller and the larger ones larger . 
  capitalism is alive and well in a liquid , the big ones become bigger :-), 
  everybody is fighting to be there . 
  only half of him . 
  even less actually , the mitochondrial dna came from the mother only . 
  after the first few sentences i was interested , we have way too few insightful articles - but turns out this is n't one of them . 
  it does not really say anything but generalities . 
  i know that you do n't , which is why i said what i said ion my last reply . 
  apparently a other people see it . 
  you keep complaining , on and on and on ... take a break and * tomorrow * do some self-reflection . 
  or do n't , whatever . 
  you focus completely on this one issue , and then you complain about how unfair people are - that last one is probably what caused the downvotes . 
  disclaimer : i 'm trying to explain other people 's behavior . 
  anyway , instead of trying to argue you should take it as an opportunity to examine * yourself * ( i.e. 
  your post ) instead of assuming that everybody else is just too stupid and does n't get your brilliant insightful post . 
  of course it is inheritable - dna can turn an egg cell into a fish , a dinosaur or a human . 
  so brains are slightly different too . 
  you are not downvoted for stating the obvious , but for being woefully ignorant about the complexities of human iq , which depends on a lot of things of which you only chose to see a single one quite deliberately . 
  your statement in the context of this thread is just stupid , that 's all . 
  on population scale other factors have always been found to be more important . 
  it 's just incredibly stupid to try to pin `` finland 's genes '' on this . 
  they are not in any meaningful way different from that of other europeans , and europeans are called `` caucasian '' for a reason . 
  downvoted for giving this guy an audience - which is all he cares for . 
  let him fade into insignificance , finally !, 
  what do you think about the actual content ? 
  it seems you limit yourself to clowning . 
  i 'm looking forward to hearing something substantial from you . 
  i must say that the main part for posting this link for me is finding out how legit it is ? 
  i can not say for myself . 
  so do n't accuse me of `` propaganda '' - i am asking you , not telling you !, 
  i can only find this on fringe websites , not on any major news website . 
  but given the atrocious quality of news reporting websites like cnn i ca n't bring myself to dismiss it just for that reason alone ?
