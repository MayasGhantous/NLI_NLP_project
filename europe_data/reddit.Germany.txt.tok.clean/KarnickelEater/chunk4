   and no , not my government . 
  not my taxes . 
  op is british . 
  i meant him . 
  i know quite a few english-speakers who live or have lived in germany without any german skills , one of them even in `` professional '' job ( marketing ) . 
  it 's certainly possibly , in the cities , depending on the job and whom you meet . 
  police ? 
  german here , not the police . 
  look at the webpage of whatever city/town you want to go , they 'll have pointers to the `` einwohnermeldeamt '' ( office for registration of inhabitants ) . 
  [ see here ( gov.uk ) ] ( https://www.gov.uk/living-in-germany ) under `` entry and residence requirements ( germany ) '' . 
  your government has prepared all the information you need , your taxes at work !, 
  [ you 'll have to look for the places yourself ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/kiev,+kyiv+city,+ukraine/@50.4020355,30.5326905,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x40d4cf4ee15a4505:0x764931d2170146fe ) - google street view is available !, 
  ( i only linked to the general area , overview map - drag the yellow guy from the bottom right corner to wherever you want to start ) by the way , for those interested in ukrainian cities , do have a look at odessa ( street view available too ) . 
  one of the most beautiful cities on earth - and i used to live in the presidio in san francisco , so my standards are high . 
  then do n't elect him . 
  simple . 
  it 's called democracy . 
  almost as idiotic to demand his resignation as all the comments in r/wtf `` how is this wtf ? '', 
  and `` who upvotes this stuff ? '' . 
  it 's because * other people * clicked on `` upvote '' !, 
  a friend of mine managed to increase the chances of survival for his breast-cancer afflicted wife from 10 % to 50 % by ignoring doctor 's advice and looking for better specialists himself . 
  the treatment she then got was not part of `` standard treatment '' , it was much closer to not-yet-commonly-practiced latest state of research . 
  she now has a very high chance of survival , chemo was over a few weeks ago and they found nothing any more in any tissues . 
  she would almost assuredly be dead by now or very soon had they followed the advice of the doctors . 
  normal clinicians follow normal best practice , they are not usually close to where research is at !, 
  sure , not everyone can go to the experts , but my friend did n't try anything extraordinary : turned out that he could make normal appointments by just calling them directly , and not a single euro changed hands either . 
  and it 's not like they did anything spectacularly new , just a different combination of treatments that were thus far noit used for * that * particular type of cancer , so even the original clinic could have done it . 
  they just do n't care , and i do n't mean that in a `` conspiracy '' type of way , it 's just that normal clinics just follow normal procedure and rarely anything else , and that is not a bad thing overall . 
  but it means that you may * not * actually get the best treatment there is . 
  maybe those who have n't been in that situation and only judge from the outside should refrain from commenting on that family , we have heard next to no background information . 
   raise awareness and deliver truth to people that are still in the grip of russian propaganda you mean : replace by kiev propaganda . 
  i 've no love for russia ( the country sucked long before this war - and i 've been there a few times and speak some russian ) , but the old kiev government ( s ) and the new one have one thing in common ( and i 've also been to ukraine a few times ) : dishonest , lying , and corrupt to the bone . 
  i love ukraine , beautiful countries . 
  horribly governed though . 
  if they gave weapons to kiev they would end up ( captured ) in russian hands in the end anyway - because you ca n't increase the fighting power of the ukrainian army by just giving them weapons , they 'll still be overrun . 
  especially in the short run , training takes years . 
  even with the training , they 'd still to actually * want * top fight , which may be true for some but i doubt it 's true for all of them . 
  not because the secretly like putin , but because they know their fighting is not going to change much - they do n't expect any government to be significantly better , so why risk your life for the oligarchs ( like the guy now heading the kiev government ) ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  he 's wearing the exact same style every businessman and politician wears all over the world , including a strange rope around his neck , that if missing would cause headlines even if it makes no sense to wear such a thing at http://www.artvalue.com/photos/auction/0/44/44024/attribued-mierevelt-michiel-ja-bildnis-eines-bartigen-mannes-2011840.jpg, 
  your sample of 1 is good enough to support whatever opinion a reader already has . 
  the probability of this happening to a number of people at any given time is essentially 1 . 
  if you are part of the random group or if you have been hacked by the kremlin - who knows ? 
  however , discussions about things that can not be shown either way are usually the best ones from the websites point of view that 's hosting them - because of `` passion '' -  clicks -  ad revenue and user bonding ( emotional connection to the place where one argues the most with the most emotions ) . 
  so go on ... 
  just posting a link - hey , i only read about this yesterday on www.spiegel.de , i did not know that and it surprised me quite a bit ... who wrote it : [ council on foreign relations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_on_foreign_relations ) `` specifically , the council on foreign relations ( cfr ) is a very mainstream , hawkish group . '', 
  `` the cfr is considered to be the nation 's `` most influential foreign-policy think tank '' .

  a blog entry about it : http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-08-21/council-foreign-relations-ukraine-crisis-west%e2%80%99s-%e2%80%93-not-putin%e2%80%99s-%e2%80%93-fault the article in foreign affairs , a publication of the cfr : http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141769/john-j-mearsheimer/why-the-ukraine-crisis-is-the-wests-fault,

  so stupid it 's not even funny when you 're reading reddit drunk . 
  exxon and rosneft , 2 weeks ago . 
  what makes you think this economic analysis is worth more than all the other economic analyses ? 
  just this week on der spiegel we had news of [ chancellor angela merkel on an economic summit ] ( http://www.dw.de/chancellor-merkel-challenges-nobel-economists/a-17868356 ) asking why economists are so wrong all the time ( she did it nicely and from scientist to scientist - she 's a physicist after all ) . 
  followed by a front-page opinion piece on [ spiegel.de : `` useless economic models : fire the economists '' ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/wolfgang-muenchau-ueber-fehler-in-prognosen-der-oekonomen-a-986405.html ) . 
  the nice thing being an economist is that depending on who pays you you can always come up with a `` study '' that is going to confirm whatever your client wants to hear . 
  after all , even if it turns out you are wrong , all the others are no better , and there are plenty of excuses why you were actually right if only x or y had n't happened . 
  no i do n't know where that leaves us , after all , it means we also do n't have any meaningful predictions for the opposing team . 
  but at the very least waving around some `` economic study '' as `` proof '' - for either side - is useless . 
  here is what could work : acknowledge that you just ca n't predict it . 
  actually , i would be willing to give any such predictions a lot more credence if the people ( not the institution ! ), 
  making it were * accountable * . 
  if you are wrong , you pay a year 's salary or something , depending on much of an impact your prognosis had . 
  reward correct prognosis if you want . 
  but they can write whatever and * always * get paid - they get paid not for being correct but for supplying the client with support . 
  bad incentive . 
  you should always add at least some text describing what a video you link to is about . 
  going to a video while reading a * text * based forum disrupts flow , and during those 4 minutes i can go through several entire topics in a subreddit while i basically get only a single comment when watching a video - huge loss of efficiency . 
  so you should add something that shows that it 's worth watching . 
  there is a reason tv news has n't replaced text-based news , text is much much more efficient . 
  idiotic response ? 
  yours , surely , because you should do basic research before posting statements with `` idiotic '' ( or similar words ) in them . 
  note that i myself do n't mind nuclear power , at the very least i 'd like to see continuing research ( incl . 
  actual engineering projects ) . 
  [ there was an article on spiegel.de ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/atomindustrie-weltweit-im-niedergang-laut-studie-von-mycle-schneider-a-842956.html ) a while ago where they looked at the broader picture worldwide , and guess what : nuclear is going down all over the world compared to all other sources of energy . 
  you are being very uninformed . 
  the costs of nuclear are enormous , it only looked good because governments had taken on much of the risk . 
  i 'm not even talking about the risk of explosion ( quite an extreme scenario ) , just securely storing waste , especially when dismantling old plants , does n't seem to be easy - and definitely not cheap . 
  [ the economist : the dream that failed - nuclear power will not go away , but ** its role may never be more than marginal ** ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21549098 ) http://www.vox.com/2014/8/1/5958943/nuclear-power-rise-fall-six-charts ( especially charts 5 ) and 6 ) ) [ the economic failure of nuclear power ] ( http://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/newreactors/cooper-smrsaretheproblemnotthesolution.pdf ) ( research paper ) http://www.eia.gov/nuclear/ [ nuclear power on the wane in the us ] ( http://nuclear-news.net/2013/02/22/nuclear-power-on-the-wane-and-cheap-gas-is-hastening-that-decline/ ) . 
  german here . 
  i do n't know a single person who is `` unnerved '' . 
  we certainly * expect * either a federation ( for ukraine ) or if that does n't happen an annexation of eastern territories ( the german vice chancellor just openly suggested it too , the federation i mean ) . 
  i think that article 's a load of crap , at least if it talks about `` germans '' . 
  not even when i look at my news sources ( like faz.net , spiegel.de ) . 
  yeah , point taken - my main point was i 'm more amazed that they have this pdf on their webshop . 
  as a web-shop-master i would not do that because i 'd be afraid anyone looking at the test summary table goes to the competition . 
  i guess they have more loyal customers than usual ... their robot vacuum cleaner , based on another companies model but improved by their own engineers , got top points ( the best ones really ) in a test by c ` t , which a year or two ago tested a lot of vacuum robot cleaners very thoroughly . 
  the next vacuum i buy is going to be a robot for sure . 
  i did n't give the downvote , but if you want to be less in danger of getting them i suggest you give * sources * for quotes . 
  not only because who knows what user hides behind the id , but even more important is that we can establish the * context * , which often let quotes appear in a very different light . 
  in that test it 's only 2nd best - and the best one costs only ~ 250 euros vs. the 900 euros for the vorwerk . 
  this pdf is on shop.vorwerk.de , but looking at the test result , who would not go for the much cheaper # 1 ? 
  it does n't have to be woman . 
  anyone can hide under a full-body veil . 
  just as far-fetched as the terror acts we actually had in europe , right ? 
  you try to change the topic ? 
  you called all of russia `` stupid people '' , just to remind you . 
  but the slaves were caught by africans , the europeans only waited in the ports . 
  it is !,
