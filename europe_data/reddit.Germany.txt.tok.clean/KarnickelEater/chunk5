  but the diseases ( and extreme stuff like ebola does n't even concern me much ) ... 
  i ca n't think of anything more stupid than such a statement , actually . 
  your home lacks a mirror ? 
  that question is not `` to you one person '' , it is for every human being . 
  the only being more stupid than a human being is a human being thinking that all the others are more stupid than that person . 
  of course , the us population is known for its feats of intelligence . 
  also , [ russia is doing quite well ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/europe/thematic/countries-with-literacy-rate.html ) it seems . 
  too bad the us is n't on that map ... edit : [ according to this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_literacy_rate ) literacy is higher in russia compared to the us . 
  unless you meant `` iq '' not education , but i refuse to believe you are so silly and assume with `` stupid '' you meant education . 
  build it ? 
  they manage building huge oil infrastructure projects just fine . 
  maybe you should n't have started slaughtering one another ? 
  sure , blame the eu now . 
  things were going just fine before the eu came , right ? 
  not that i like that bureaucratic monster , but here they are blamed when much more blame lies in that region . 
  until a suicide bomber uses this to hide explosives . 
  far-fetched ? 
  sure , this kind of stuff does n't happen in europe , ever . 
  they search rucksacks of soccer fans going into stadiums , they can hardly search fully veiled women without causing a huge uproar , or wasting a lot of effort by having to create special search zones , fully shielded from outside view and only females allowed ... sure , there is an element of `` hate '' in these laws , but there 's that too . 
  brussels is n't some minor village that nobody knows , it 's a real target . 
  the us is going to disappear from focus once they start lowering their numbers so much that it 's no longer interesting . 
  simple and easy . 
  what 's the problem anyway ? 
  you do n't like it , do n't click on the story . 
  why do you think you have to tell other people what they should be discussing ? 
  tl ; dr : overall a clear thumbs up for organic foods ( just summarizing the abstract , not giving an opinion ) . 
  i can only talk about germany , but around here it is * organized * begging , not poverty begging . 
  well , those doing the begging * are * poor - but they will remain so even if you hand over a thousand euros per day to each of them . 
  because they are `` employed '' . 
  begging is a business . 
  also , this : http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-hamburg-romanian-family-makes-begging-a-dubious-business-a-960866.html you are not helping lift people out of poverty when you give them money !!!, 
  and yes , there are quite a few badly looking types ( diseases , handicapped ) - but it 's more likely that the begging mafia deliberately sought them out because they make more money . 
  from other continents ( far east ) we have seen stories ( researched by journalists not just reddit anecdotes ) where the begging mafia deliberately maim children , like cut off a hand . 
  http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/04/gang-profits-from-maimed-child-beggars/ http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/giving_money_to_child_beggars_don_t_do_it.html again - and i 'm not sure why that is n't obvious to anyone with eyes and a brain : if you give money to beggars you only cause the appearance of more beggars . 
  if you * really * care about helping the poor , do it in an organized way , or just give money to respectable organizations . 
  do not give cash to random individuals that you do n't know !, 
  this just creates more and more incentive to abuse the generosity ( and gullibility ) of people . 
   having the worst politicians imaginable you do n't keep track of us news at least over the last decade , do you ? 
  i take the bundestag over us congress any day . 
  level of cooperation significantly higher , levels of nastiness much lower . 
  same with the public discourse ( see internet forums where political topics or just daily events are being discussed ) . 
  why would i care if some random group of people i never met win a f.cking * game * somewhere on the planet ? 
  if it was so the entire world ( of humans ) would be laughing and smiling all the time , since games are going on all the time everywhere and somehow magically that should translate to everyones happiness , regardless of anything else ( daily rat race , unclear outlook , complete loos of the post-ussr/eas-german wall optimism , etc. 
  says the armchair redditor from home . 
  if it 's okay to link to major us sites such as cnn rt should be fine too . 
  mind you , i myself go to cnn but never to rt , but a lot of very interesting ( but troubling ) us stories that i find on major german sites ( der spiegel - reputation akin to the bbc , most important publication in germany ) i can often not find at all on cnn , and i 'm using their us page . 
  they skip a lot of inconvenient news ( and instead post celebrity stories ) !, 
  it 's nice of you to notice bias , now if only you were n't so biased about where you see bias ... 
  haaretz ' story sucked because you only got a single paragraph as a non-subscriber , while sources like the telegraph had an article longer than one page . 
  linking to haaretz has the only advantage that no one can claim it 's made-up anti-israel propaganda . 
   not everything is some contrived zionist conspiracy . 
  what a stupid asshole comment to make after starting out normal . 
  the reason they stated was as op claims and not `` already posted '' . 
  they tagged it right in the headline . 
  a proper flag is very important . 
  the fate of democracy and the prosperity and happiness of the people of the eu depends on it !, 
  we should think about this issue some more , involve more people , have some committees and much more public discussion . 
  if we get this wrong , all hell could break loose !, 
  i 'm german and i protest at the oppressive german pedestrian traffic light regime by waiting for red to deliberately piss people off . 
  actually , quite a few people start following my example almost every time ( # ) ... we have some ridiculously stupid timings on some pedestrian traffic lights , where they make you wait an additional 15 seconds even after the two low-traffic car lanes have had red , for example . 
  ( # ) there was a study about this . 
  when the `` perpetrator '' wears a suit or something similar so that he/she appears to have `` status '' other people are likely to follow the example to cross on red , if it 's a `` low status '' individual they will not . 
  the actual articles from the two reporters who reported this : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/russian-military-vehicles-enter-ukraine-aid-convoy-stops-short-border and http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11035401/russian-armoured-vehicles-and-military-trucks-cross-border-into-ukraine.html, 
  to be fair , one would have to include a graph list_of_european_countries_by_median_cost_of_living, 
  i would think having more than one of a type makes maintenance costs per ship cheaper compared to having lots of different vessels ? 
  so i can see quite understandable economic reasons for wanting `` all or nothing '' . 
  thank you for saying this !, 
  you should be president of all earth !, 
  you know so much , everyone else is just naive , especially an organization who for about a hundred years have worked all over the world in crisis regions . 
  but we have you to tell them how stupid they are , you enlightened being !, 
  you are a redditor , that is qualification enough to tell others how wrong and naive they are , right ? 
  according to this article this has been allowed by kiev and is lead by the red cross . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-russischer-konvoi-mit-lebensmitteln-in-moskau-aufgebrochen-a-985603.html also see http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2014/08-11-ukraine-east-civilians-plight-concern.htm, 
  `` der spiegel '' , the most important news site in germany ( and the largest and most well-known magazine ) has an article on the front page about just this that says this is in agreement with kiev and lead by the red cross . 
  some 300 vehicles , the article also lists some of the cargo . 
  fuck you . 
  somehow i expected something much better - this is just a summary for anyone who lived in a cave the last ten years , no deeper insights at all . 
  strange thing is that germany 's largest and renowned `` der spiegel '' among all their totally-in-the-government-line very-critical-of-putin articles did feel they needed to give people in ( german ) intelligence a voice too , and i remember at least two articles where a german general and in another one a ( former ? ), 
  german `` intelligence '' guy said that there really is no evidence to blame anyone , and that the whole issue is actually - judging from just the available evidence and not emotions - completely open and unproven . 
  edit : by the way , i just received $ 100 from putin for posting this , haha . 
  too bad what i said can be checked and will be found to be true , but who would bother ... hey , just read everything on der spiegel about mh17 ( it 's a lot and all in german though ) . 
  most of it on the same line as most news sources , but more careful and they do have these voices too . 
  edit : [ found one of the articles ( 24.7.2014 ) ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/tv/anne-will-talk-zu-mh17-mit-diplomaten-aus-russland-und-ukraine-a-982626.html ) . 
  the general was [ kujat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harald_kujat ) . 
  it 's the summary of a talk show . 
  the only one who said anything of interest was kujat ( the others where a russian and a ukrainian diplomat so you know what each of them said in advance ) . 
  what a bullshit response . 
  and i have no eggs at all in this basket , just clicking through all topics and found this `` very mildly interesting '' ( lack of better content today ) . 
  let 's just keep it honest and say you do n't know a good answer and leave it at that . 
  roundabout emotional accusations and appeal ( always successful ) to the stupid emotional masses instead of arguments ... sure , go right ahead , it 's reddit . 
  to those complaining about switzerland : you are aware that end of last week us company exxon mobil and russian rosneft announced that they 'd jointly start developing arctic oil fields ? 
  usa - what sanctions ??? 
  not if their big business interests are concerned . 
  ( i 'm not even complaining ), 
  amazing that none of the specialists at the zoos has thought of that . 
  they should hire you for your deep insights !, 
  no , put you in command of all of the zoos of denmark !, 
  obviously they do n't know anything and need you . 
  of course , if you had read the article you might have noticed that these are the fantasies of an * architect * ( and there is nothing wrong with that ) . 
  of course , every design idea has to be criticized by reddit-specialists as if it 's the real building plan immediately , because playing with design ideas already damages the world and the animals , as everyone knows .
