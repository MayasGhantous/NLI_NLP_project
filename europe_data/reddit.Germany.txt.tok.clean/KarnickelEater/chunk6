  scientific studies performed by armchair ph.d. s in reddit-ology have shown that !, 
  did i miss something ? 
  russia looks more stable than ever . 
  east ukraine is the crisis area . 
  this is not a statement about the `` goodness '' or whatever of putin , it 's just that what you say makes no sense at all . 
  and i 'd even go to ukraine even now , western ukraine any time ( i as in lviv/lemberg just last november ) . 
   now i wo n't go there on principle this statement is worthy of / r/wtf wtf ? 
  just stupid . 
  not even that you wo n't go - there are plenty of places i wo n't go ( climate , diseases , safety , no interest ) , what makes it `` wtf '' is that you feel the need to proudly announce it to the world . 
  you just showed that putin !, 
  a good reason not to go to russia is the visa policy . 
  i can go to ukraine with just my passport , for russia i need an invitation ( which i can get from businesses via an internet order for not much money ) , get a visa , pay money . 
  each and every time , unless i get a multiple-entry visa , which also is more expensive and more complicated . 
  and you need at least some russian , with just english that country is no fun to travel . 
  some substance please , but spare me the empty , stupid , righteous rhetoric . 
  there 's already too much of that , which is a big part of the problem . 
  i do n't want food distributors to `` do something about it '' , not now and not in the past . 
  it 's inconceivable to me what one has to do with the other . 
  `` it 's symbol '' is some of the stupidest * ( not a mistake ) * things humans managed to come up with . 
  let 's hold hands for world piece !, 
  let 's punish some random people in israel , that 's going to show their government !, 
  depends on how you define `` known '' . 
  they certainly could have been known if they had n't been forcefully `` ignored '' ( i.e. 
  suppressed ) , meaning anyone who dared say something declared a liar . 
  40s in : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w42x6-wf3cs, 
  i 'm from east germany . 
  he is very famous in east germany ( i ca n't say `` was '' even though that country no longer exists , but those who lived in the gdr still remember him ) . 
  they showed perfectly synchronized ( german language ) versions on east german tv , so i do n't know how he sounds like in french ... same with the [ `` olsen gang '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olsen_gang ) , also extremely popular back in east germany . 
  i do n't get what 's funny . 
  i do n't think it is my english . 
  actually , to me this is a sentence without any real meaning . 
   with the obsession with the war in this country we have a war in germany ??? 
  oh and i just watched 60 % of the video before i stopped , because it 's at most ( very ) mildly funny . 
  not a single mention of the war thus far ( one very short reference to british stereotypes of germans goose stepping ) . 
  so i guess it 's all in the last 40 % - those of you only interested in that part can skip the first half ( you wo n't miss much ) . 
  what germans and british have in common ( i lived in the us not the uk so correct me if i 'm wrong ) : a love of ( the kind of humor produced by ) monty python or rowan atkinson but i could name plenty more . 
  what separates them : we germans will never , ever in this millennium ( nor did we in the previous one ) be able to produce such humor , we have to import it from the uk . 
  i 'm fine with that , the best kind of german humor that i know is very educational . 
  political cabaret that is n't just stupid jokes but * teaches * something , a ( n important ) side to stories that most people overlook . 
  [ volker pispers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volker_pispers ) can do that ( 50/50 , the other half are stupid low-level jokes about angela merkel ) . 
  * might * the west be lying ? 
  the `` west '' has done much more to cast doubt on their credibility than putin 's hoards could ever have done . 
  it 's like blaming the fungus on the tree for the tree 's death - but the fungus only takes hold when the tree is already dying . 
  somewhat bad analogy ( for those seeking the weak points ) , the west is n't dying ( and i 'm quite a happy german ) , i could n't come up with a better one just now . 
  and since i know ukraine at least a little bit ( spent a few months there west and east of the country - love it !, 
  odessa , for example , one of the most beautiful cities i know , and i 've traveled a lot ) , blaming putin for all ukraine 's woes is just stupid . 
  same analogy as above comes to mind ( with the same weak point that the country is n't `` dying '' ; maybe better to say `` sick '' ) . 
  conveniently ignoring that ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries on this planet . 
  in europe it 's actually # 1 - great achievement !, 
  http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/feb/04/welcome-to-the-most-corrupt-nation-in-europe-ukraine they are hitting themselves , and have done so since the inception of ukraine after the fall of the ussr . 
  that 's a tank . 
  the puma is an infantry vehicle . 
  and :  a full prototype is estimated to be completed in 2016 , and should the project be finalised and approved following evaluation , mass production is scheduled to begin in 2018 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl-01 vs. puma :  replacement began in 2010 and is scheduled for completion by 2020 . 
  mass production began on 6 july 2009 .

  hmm ... maybe it has something to do with relevance and people are not actually so stupid ? 
  because human behavior depends on context ? 
  and with relevance i mean what one human can do . 
  i watch lots of lecture videos - youtube channels gresham college , rsa , etc. 
  and lots of courses on coursera and edx . 
  but me knowing more has next to zero impact on the rest of the world . 
  because i ** am ** nobody . 
  i have no role in society . 
  and if i did i would make just as horrible decisions as current politicians or `` leaders '' , even though i know soooo much by now . 
  why ? 
  because if there is one thing i learned learning it is that there is too much for any one person . 
  and not just a little bit `` too much '' , but as in `` trying to drink all ( not just one ) oceans '' . 
  because humanity is a * organism * and knowledge as well as action are distributed . 
  [ here , read this explanation . 
  ] ( https://medium.com/@kevin_ashton/what-coke-contains-221d449929ef ) * and do n't get hung up that they chose `` coke '' , it could have been any product . 
  * your premise is wrong . 
  very wrong . 
  you blame the masses for `` how they are '' . 
  you do zero analysis , you just look at what is and take it at fave value . 
  [ we have a huge inequality issue . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tccosrzqvy ) we have only a 0.1 % of the population in control of the economy ( and thereby much of politics ) . 
  most people are busy with their lives . 
  sure , if everybody would spend much more of their time learning stuff we 'd be better off , but thinking that the problem is as you think is on the wrong track . 
  is society the way it is because people are the way they are or the other way around ? 
  both . 
  but blaming the people is exactly wrong - it is the opposite !, 
  the fact that society is the way it is should tell you that the `` leader driven '' society does not work well at all . 
  why ? 
  because we have such a society and always had !, 
  so what society we have now can 100 % be attributed to exactly the thing you bemoan . 
  and you call for more of what we already have and always had in a circular argument . 
   but it is the government 's message what have i said ?? 
  `` emotional '' seems to be your keyword that you throw at anyone who says something you do n't like . 
  seems like you do n't even have emotions , just knee-jerk reactions ( i.e. 
  from spinal neurons , your brain is never even involved ) . 
  i like how you make a claim and than use that as `` proof '' . 
   ... and therefore weak yep , no brain was involved in the making of your comments !, 
  why not stick to the actual explanation , as you give it , and instead alienate even more people by coming up with bs stuff ? 
  what you say makes sense , why not use that message ? 
  why instead focus on something silly ? 
  your message would have had some force , the one they now came up with does n't . 
  all it does is activate the most stupid parts of the populations of the countries involved . 
  i have a lot of sympathies for your message , i have very little for the one actually coming from the greek government . 
  it seems to me their main focus is blaming others . 
  it seems to me they would still have much to do in greece , institutions , corruption , tax collection etc.
