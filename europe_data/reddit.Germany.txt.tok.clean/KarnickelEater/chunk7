  - does n't look like they achieved much on that front . 
  no , the normal people should not suffer , that is an argument against what the eu does and did - their policies do n't seem to help greek solve their actual issues and instead hurt the country . 
  but i do n't see the greek government looking any better . 
  yes , why ? 
  but the other way around . 
  not `` why not '' , but `` why '' . 
  because assumptions times claims times precedence times mood . 
  [ here 's a list of wars greece was involved in . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_greece#20th_century ) did they pay or ask for any reparations ? 
  what about all other wars and nations . 
  and how would you calculate that anyway ? 
  also , people who would benefit overwhelmingly were n't even born at the time . 
  the point is trying to calculate in detail who owes what in the world just does n't work . 
  it is stupid . 
  there is no point in even reacting to someone who asks that question . 
  just ignore them ( ie . 
  posts like yours ) the same way you pretend nothing happened when your grandmother farts at the dinner table . 
  it 's not even funny . 
  somebody is just trying to be an annoying cunt . 
  i 'm in the 3rd column . 
  my rank is one higher than what adolf hitler achieved when he served . 
  i have no idea why i just made that connection . 
  the fact that you ask on reddit shows that you do n't really care about the answer . 
  maybe that is why you did n't finish a sentence that starts with `` why '' with a question mark ? 
  just observing :-), 
  how does ca have a water problem if all it takes is to scale back their out of bound desert agriculture ? 
  `` omg it feeds america ! '', 
  there are plenty of sunny places with water * in the world * . 
  it 's not like abandoning failed places , moving and rebuilding elsewhere is uncommon in the us . 
  ca does n't have a water problem , it has an agriculture problem - which is solvable by the humans causing it . 
  and as for only ca in all of na has a problem ( !??!, 
  ) , it does not take one long to find things like [ arizona could be out of water in six years ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/arizona-could-be-out-water-6-years-180951814/?no-ist ) are you people who try to justify a stupid and ridiculous map all stupid too ? 
  that map looks very made up . 
  apart from many issues with making such a map at all - `` water '' is not the same as `` amount of rain '' . 
  let me just pick the us as an example since ca has been in the news recently . 
  ca is red - and the entire rest of the us is labeled `` no problem '' . 
  no , the entire american continent !!!!, 
  so of all of north america only one region has a problem , and coincidentally the problems end exactly at the borders of the state of ca . 
  because texas , new mexico , arizona are green states full of water . 
  this `` map '' is a bad joke . 
  the spiegel article says the president signed it , the parliament `` published '' it ( whatever that means ) . 
  see the text . 
  [ ** english version by google translate ** ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fausland%2fukraine-verbietet-filme-mit-positivem-russlandbild-a-1026924.html&amp;edit-text= ) ( machine translation - copy & paste ; * edit : okay , the translation was so atrocious i edited it a little bit so it should be better than the link above * )  how do ukrainians view russia ? 
  on this , the government in kiev wants massive influence and therefore now forbids with a cultural politics controversial law all movies with positive representation of russian and soviet authorities . 
  affected regardless of country of origin are all stripes produced after august 1 , 1991 , says the president petro poroshenko who signed the document . 
  the law published by the parliament in kiev is a legislative response to the war in the eastern ukraine . 
    it threatens fines for those who paint a `` positive image of employees of the `` aggressor country '' . 
  so far , russian films and series are dominate ukrainian tv channels . 
  critics have accused the kiev government , that is supported by the eu and the us of `` censorship '' before . 
    the leadership in moscow warned of a growing `` russians hate '' in the neighboring country . 
  previously , the pro-western leaders had also forbidden russian television . 
  in addition , more than a dozen russian artists are banned from entry . 
  the ministry of culture in kiev is working on a system that in the future requires books in the russian language to be licensed for the ukrainian market after . 
  -- ** update : ** here 's another link , ** not nearly as exciting as the first one ** ( i thought der spiegel is reliable ) http://mashable.com/2015/04/02/ukraine-ban-russian-films/ this one says `` russian military '' . 
  the spiegel actually is quite a reliable paper , they leave that word out . 
  seems like i really need more sources . 
   according to the new legislation :   distribution and public screening of films made by russian individuals and companies , as well as films containing propaganda and whose plots involve , directly or indirectly russian law enforcement bodies ( including positive portrayal ) , armed forces , other military or security forces and their individual representatives , authorities and forces , are hereby prohibited in ukraine . '', 
  you must have a troubled life with your fear of making any decisions whatsoever : * everything * is `` may '' . 
  unless you know someone who can predict the future ( `` predict '' to me implies `` reliably '' - being right by chance is not a prediction , it 's a guess ) . 
  you do n't mention two things : - a distance for your `` 50cm '' . 
  - that the weapon has been manufactured to 1990s bundeswehr specifications and does exactly what was demanded of it . 
  they asked for accuracy for single shots , they did n't foresee a need for a weapon that remains accurate after sustained fire - which would have raised the price of the gun substantially , of course . 
  that 's according to the spiegel article that you may have read too ( since they too mention `` 50cm off '' without giving a distance ) . 
   are not suffering because the rich are too rich how do you know that ? 
  the common ( unconscious ? ), 
  idea about `` rich '' is an image like scrooge mcduck - `` they have money '' . 
  which is wrong . 
  money does not matter . 
  if they merely had `` money '' you would be completely right and nobody should care about the difference between the rich and others . 
  but really what they have is * control * . 
  they have control over money streams . 
  and it is * moving * money that works , not static money . 
  by controlling the streams they control what gets produced and consumed . 
  global resources go towards the ideas of a tiny few select people . 
  note what i 'm saying : not `` towards their consumption '' , that would be silly . 
  but if the rich think the solution to a problem ( of all people incl . 
  the poor ) is x than x gets done . 
  that may actually be something `` efficient '' in economic terms , like walmart being much more efficient at the distribution of goods than an equal amount of small retailers . 
  you may argue `` but that 's what people want , they prefer walmart that 's why they are so big '' . 
  well ... that 's based on a circular argument : the mass of people get less and less control of the * streams * of money circulating in the economy , so they are forced to by as cheap as possible . 
  basically , rich and poor is n't an issue of `` rich '' and `` poor '' . 
  it is an issue of whose ideas shape the world . 
  politically countries are called a democracy , but economic decisions about what happens are very , very much done by only a fraction of the people . 
  note that this by itself is not a value statement . 
  when you conclude that there are too many idiots you may conclude it 's better to have the future development of mankind in the hands of a few who you think are better able to make decisions than `` the masses '' . 
  that is a political decision . 
  and it 's much more complicated than simple b/w statements . 
  i for example am for doing whatever actually works and brings progress . 
  if i have the choice of a wonderful peaceful happy society that stands still and a violent , unjust depression inducing society that gets things done ( research , progress , even if it 's bad for 90 % of people ) - to name some imaginary extremes - i 'm all for the ladder , even though i 'm very likely to be in the struggling part . 
  i might not act that way because of selfishness , but privately i 'd acknowledge progress is better , even if it leads through many valleys of tears . 
  -- a thought in that context : why are corporations seen as `` evil '' and fought by those who are on the side of more equality and justice ? 
  corporations are one of the best things * socially * that ever happened to humans . 
  they can be used for good or bad . 
  they transcend nations and races !, 
  they are oriented towards what * works * !, 
  when you are a member it gives you protection against many pressures . 
  if you had to sell yourself in a truly capitalist system every day you 'd be a lot more stressed out . 
  see dilbert and [ reddit frontpage threads like this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/30nncf/90_of_the_workforce/ ) . 
  at least you get your share of society 's resources even though you have no real function !, 
  mass layoffs happen , but overall being a member of a large corporation is one of the best things that can happen to a human .
