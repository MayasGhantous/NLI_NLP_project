really ? 
  those are your examples ? 
  how about lord of the rings , monty python , edgar wright and harry potter ? 
  i ca n't really think how anything nicer could be possible . 
  to quote / u/samuel79s elsewhere in this thread :  certainly not something to be proud under current morality frameworks , but the conquest of mexico is just unbelievable . 
  from a military point , the [ battle of france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_france ) was just astounding . 
  alledgedly , the german leadership expected a million casualties . 
  but the war lasted only 6 weeks and costed the german side only 30.000 man - much less than in the battle of verdun alone . 
  defeating a world power is on thing , defeating one so fast it gives the country a really unjustified reputation of being bad at war ? 
  that is a whole different level . 
  also , sabaton made a kickass song about rommel 's [ ghost division ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fkyxnm70vg ) . 
  i go with the [ battle of lechfeld ( 955 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lechfeld_%28955%29 ) , ending almost a hundred years of [ hungarian raids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_invasions_of_europe ) , and made them settle down to found their own kingdom . 
  also , the invention of the printing press by gutenberg around 1440 . 
   this attitude will destroy europe , and it 's already happening . 
  could you explain that further ? 
  i am curios what you think of churchill 's speech in the beginning of the article :  what general weygand has called the battle of france is over . 
  the battle of britain is about to begin . 
  upon this battle depends the survival of christian civilisation . 
  upon it depends our own british life and the long continuity of our institutions and our empire . 
   let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties , and so bear ourselves that , if the british empire and its commonwealth last for a thousand years , men will still say , `` this was their finest hour '' . 
  with the british empire shrunken to gibraltar and the falkland-islands , and christianity in the uk quickly fading , it seems what they have tried to protect vanished anyway . 
  and yeah , i know this sounds a bit cynical . 
   black beard black beard , as in the pirate captain ? 
  or do you mean blue beard ? 
  what a lot of people forget nowadays is that there was an [ large scale uprising against the `` liberators '' in 1953 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uprising_of_1953_in_east_germany ) , just 8 years after the war . 
  oh sure . 
  when the romanians do it , it 's called `` reunion '' . 
  it 's not just china . 
  look at brazil , or iran . 
  i think the most dramatic transformation happened in [ south korea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_south_korea#vital_statistics ) , where the tfr fell from 6.1 ind 1960 and 4.5 in 1970 to 1.2 in 2014 . 
  they gone from `` population explosion '' to `` we are dying out '' in a single lifetime . 
  that is literally the first time i ever heard of this . 
  could you provide a source ? 
  all [ wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbeitsmigration#entwicklung_in_der_bundesrepublik_deutschland ) says about post-war/pre -1960 working immigration are the italians and refugees from east germany . 
  people are left ignorant of history . 
  if you wanted to show children german history , you could also send them ( for example ) to the [ walhalla memorial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walhalla_memorial ) . 
  the way it is handled now , it 's all about guilt . 
  from my personal experiences , germans have very much forgotten their history . 
  i barely know anyone under 30 who knows anything about the napoleonic wars or the thirty years war . 
  can we please stop that `` guest workers rebuild our country '' - nonsense ? 
  that is nothing short of a lie . 
  ( west - ) germany ( or rather all of western europe ) was rebuild by survivers and american money , not by the turkish workers who came 1961 , 16 years after the war . 
  salzburg was a german-speaking city in the hre , just like trier or cologne . 
  it was ruled by an de-facto independent arch-bishop , but so where the other two . 
  if it is valid to say `` cologne was a german city during that time '' then it is valid to say `` salzburg was a german city during that time '' . 
   for him to be german , you 'd have to consider every territory that was part of the hre to be german . 
  no , you do n't have to do that . 
  you just have to consider the territory mozart was born in as german , which is valid . 
  the existence of czech or italian parts of the hre does not exclude the existence of german parts . 
  `` for david beckham to be english , you 'd have to consider every territory that is part of the uk to be english . 
  that 's obviously ridiculous . '', 
  does this sentence makes sense to you ? 
  because that is basically what you said . 
  the intervention of the swedish king gustav adolf in the [ thirty-years-war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war#casualties_and_disease ) lead to the dead of up to 8 million germans , about a third of the population . 
  similiar things happenend when swedish troops attacked poland-lithuania during the [ deluge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_%28history%29#destruction_of_the_commonwealth ) . 
  i do n't get what you are saying here . 
  nobody said he was german because he was born in the hre . 
   dresden , the city the movement originated from , has little to no immigrant population according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dresden#demographics ) , 8.7 % of the population in dresden has an migration background . 
  that is hardly `` little to no immigrant population '', 
  it 's called `` german alphabet '' because the typeletter was developed in germany , and they used it til well in the 20th century , unlike most of europe . 
  technically it is however not really it 's own alphabet but a collection of fonds for the latin alphabet . 
  also , [ here is the link for the gaelic type ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaelic_type ) . 
  the rest of the posters can be viewed on his site [ tillmans.co.uk ] ( http://tillmans.co.uk/ ) . 
  most of them are cringeworthy , for the lack of better words . 
  the video shows why they are leaving syria . 
  it does n't show why they are going to europe . 
   for centuries in early and middle antiquity , europe meant the world surrounding the mediterranean , or mare nostrum ( `` our sea '' ) , as the romans famously called it . 
  no , it did n't . 
  europe meant the land between the `` pillars of heracles '' ( gibraltar ) and the river don . 
  the land surrounding the mediterranean sea was separated in asia , europe and lybia ( africa ) , as shown in [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/herodotus_world_map.jpg ) from herodotus . 
  the teutonic order is the english translation of the latin * ordo theutonicorum * , which just means * german knights * . 
  thats an example of how the exonym/endonym-issue can lead to confusion . 
  the name of the ancient tribe has the same root as the word * deutsche * . 
  that would solve neither of the reasons i gave in my example . 
   for centuries in early and middle antiquity , europe meant the world surrounding the mediterranean , or mare nostrum ( `` our sea '' ) , as the romans famously called it . 
  no , it did n't . 
  europe meant the land between th `` pillars of heracles '' ( gibraltar ) and the river don . 
  the land surrounding the mediterranean sea was separated in * asia * , * europe * and * lybia * ( africa ) , as shown in [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/herodotus_world_map.jpg ) from herodotus . 
  with literaly the third sentence of the article being bullshit , i doubt there is much reason to read it completly . 
  teutonia , if you mean the english name . 
  reasons : closer to the endonym deutschland and it would make talking about the ancient germans or the germanic languages less confusing . 
  now i have to imaging how they do this in a stadion closed to the public because of a terror threat . 
  the mistake that the author of the article makes is assuming socialism = marxism . 
  socialism refers to a much wider range of ideologies . 
  if you look at the oxford definiton :  ** socialism ** a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production , distribution , and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole . 
  so , internationalism is n't a integral part of socialism , the integral part is just ownership by the `` community '' - the national community in case of the national socialists . 
  and the reason they imprisoned the members of the communistic and the social democratic parties is related to that : they were internationalists . 
  could someone explain the context of that demo , or post a translation of the description on youtube ? 
  which side do you mean ? 
  i should have formulated my comment more careful , i guess . 
  what i wanted to say is : whatever point b\u00f6hmermann ( the creator of this song ) intendede to make , i can not get past the arrogance that oozes from the video . 
  and when i saw the line i quoted , i really wanted to point out the irony , that in a song full of so much patronizing and superiority-feeling the singer states he knows `` where assholery leads '' . 
   trust our teutonic expertice , we know where assholery leads so , should i expect that the creator of this video is going to shot himself in his own bunker ? 
  because that who ever made this is a douchbag is really the only message i am getting from it . 
  also , i 'm expecting the comment section on youtube will have a lot of german comments on how clever this , and some english ones of how stupid germans are . 
   the plan was articulated in a 45-page policy document put forward by members of a bavarian branch of the alternative for germany so , not the afd , but a local chapter . 
   the afd 's leadership in bavaria distanced itself from the proposal and not even the bavarian branch itself . 
  pretty stupid headline . 
  can anyone provide a link to that video ? 
  none of the news articles i found got one .
