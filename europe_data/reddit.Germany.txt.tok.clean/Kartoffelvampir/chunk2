   germany is sort of like our junior sibling , a younger culture i see this a lot , so often i ca n't even judge someone for thinking so . 
  * germany existed in the middle ages , and it was part of the holy roman empire . 
  * in 1356 , the golden bull ( [ english version ] ( http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/golden.asp ) ) , some sort of ` constition ' of the hre , declared who gets to elect the emporer , and which elector gets which title . 
  the archbishops of trier , cologne and mainz became chancellors of burgundy , italy and germany , respectively . 
  and that is not slobby translation - the contemporary german version calls it * dutschelant * . 
  the same document also mentions the german language at some point . 
  so , germany existed , as part of the hre . 
  the better question might be when east francia became germany . 
  that was a gradual process in the high middle ages , through 911 or 919 could be given as date , with the elections of the first non arolingian or the first non frankish king ( not emporer ) . 
  crap . 
  it should have been * end the conflict * . 
  i was to busy figuring out which words need a capital letter - i changed it now . 
  and so the war of the ring begins ... we should send sarkozy to throw the ring into mt etna . 
  it is the only way to end the conflict . 
  wikimedia has a clear map with the [ nuts-3 regions ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/nuts_3_regions_eu-27.svg/2000px-nuts_3_regions_eu-27.svg.png ) if that is small enough for you . 
   either it comes from some farlefts or from the german press not really mutually exclusive . 
  the op posted the source , its from der spiegel . 
  so , you were correct . 
   at the teachers demonstration 150k according to the organizers that makes me even more wonder about the lack of shots from above in the video , because that would certainly be an impressive looking crowd . 
  about the strike : the [ opinion polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/next_hungarian_parliamentary_election ) in hungary dont seem to suggest that orban lost a lot of voters . 
  so why the strike now ? 
  and which parties are organising it ? 
  city state might be the wrong word for some of them , but it was a collection of increasingly independent principialities . 
  here ist the [ map of 1648 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/hrr_1648.png ) . 
  that might be why he wrote * any german province * instead of * germany *, 
  we see barely any views from above the crowd , making it hard to estimate there numbers . 
  does anyone have an official number on how many people where at the protest ? 
  here is the quote :  `` you 'll put down strangers , / kill them , cut their throats , possess their houses , / and lead the majesty of law in lyam / to slip him like a hound . 
  say now the king / as he is clement if th ' offender mourn , / should so much come too short of your great trespass / as but to banish you : whither would you go ? / what country , by the nature of your error , / should give you harbour ? 
  go you to france or flanders , / to any ** german province ** , spain or portugal , / nay , anywhere that not adheres to england : / why , you must needs be strangers . '' i put the highlights on because a lot people on reddit asume that there was n't any germany or german language in that time period , and even doubt it if the name appears in contemporary documents . 
  i just checked out the [ ratification process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine\u2013european_union_association_agreement#ratification ) on wiki . 
  is there any reason that just the netherlands have a referendum on this ? 
  edit : apparently , there was a public request for that referendum . 
  also :  suspensory , non-binding referendum which has effect when a simple majority votes `` against '' and turnout is at least 30 % . 
  seems like it is n't so much about how many vote against it and more about how many vote at all . 
  good old / r/slavs _ squatting, 
  my guess ? 
  because russia is willing to give them money , and is the only bigger power both willing and able to do so . 
  if poland would be able and willing to finance an anti-eu-party in france , they would likely just as much pro poland . 
   the group formed a chain to intercept asylum seekers trying to board lorries it doesnt sound like the robbers went into the camp itself, 
  what are those refugees who avoid being registrated going to do ? 
  telling it the cops ? 
  it is called [ paris syndrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ) . 
  it was original named for japanese tourist , but has been known for chinese lately . 
  different levels of intensity in their silence, 
  it was only a matter of time until they burst to the surface . 
  i , for one , welcome our new skaven overlords . 
  it probably lived in the sewers , teaching turtles in martial arts . 
  their secretary, 
  for comparison : there where about [ 66,000 births in serbia in 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_serbia#1950.e2.80.932014 ), 
  is that river polluted , or are all serbs faceless nighmares ? 
  while the premise of norway being occupied by russia sounded interesting , the scenario they choose to justify that really prevented me from watching the show . 
  russia invading a scandinavian country with the eu to incompetent to do anything about it ? 
  sure . 
  the eu asking russia to invade it because a green goverment was elected ? 
  yeah , i 'm not buying that . 
   02 dec 2014 that is a pretty old report . 
  a mod should propably put a `` dated '' signature on the title . 
  ironically , the people behind this ad are likely much more affluent than the anti-immigration people that fat guy is supposed to represent . 
  that video is circlejerking at it finest . 
   a detailed report seen by germany 's bild newspaper just fyi , die bild has a similar reputation as the daily mail or rt. 
  also , the article linked is hidden behind a paywall , meaning there is no way to seeing how the report was made . 
   all of us can , for instance , take the more intelligent of our simple-solution friends down to the local chinese and sit beneath a pacific-centric map of the world . 
  [ ... ] soberingly marginal , pressed up against the outermost edge of that world : europe , the countries of the european union . 
  and if we look for our countries : italy , poland , croatia -- where are they ? 
  even france and germany take a while to find , and luxemburg and slovenia are mere pinheads . 
  that woman is way to condescending for someone who thinks italy is hard to find on a pacific-centered worls map . 
  while the idea is interessting , the exemples they used are pretty weird : most of these buildings on the site still exist : * [ butchers ' guild hall , hildesheim ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/hildesheim_knochenhauer-hd.jpg ) * [ wernigerode town hall ] ( http://fewo-am-westerntor-wernigerode.de/images/rathaus_wernigerode.jpg ) * [ castle of sigmaringen ] ( http://img.webme.com/pic/s/schloesser-bawue/hohenzollernschloss_6.jpg ) an example for an actually destroyed building would be the [ schauspielhaus of frankfurt ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/frankfurt_altes_schauspielhaus_1914.jpg ) . 
  i find the last paragraph a bit odd :  failure to act decisively now will lead to the eventual failure of the peaceful , integrated , globalised , supra-national state that is the eu , and the rise of dystopian nationalist regimes . 
  the contours of such places have been reflected in literary works such as george orwell 's 1984 , aldous huxley 's brave new world , and michel houellebecq 's latest novel submission . 
  let us hope that they remain confined to the printed page . 
  was n't the `` brave new world '' a completly peaceful , integrated , globalised , supra-national state ? 
  it has been a while since i had the book in school . 
  also , from what i read about the book in reviews , what france became in `` soumission '' sounded similar : peaceful , globalised , and head of a supranational eu . 
  honestly , i fail to see how any of the dystopies he listed here where `` nationalist '' . 
  the thread looks more like people living in london pointing out fear-mongering . 
  i doubt that nationalistic and anti-eu parties , with the exception of those in poland and the baltics , consider russia a `` common enemy '' . 
  they tend to see russia as a potential ally , and any `` anti-russian '' propaganda will likely just enforce that view . 
  yeah , that argument in title is dumb . 
  the hungarians that received asylum in the west are * not * the hungarians that reject asylum seekers . 
  the later are the ones that stayed in hungary and have no reason to feel sympathy to people fleeing from their countries . 
  looking at the numbers ( [ see here ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_de_sondages_sur_l%27%c3%a9lection_pr%c3%a9sidentielle_fran%c3%a7aise_de_2017#2016 ) ) , it seems that the only reason juppe would beat le pen in the first round is that fran\u00e7ois bayrou is not given as canditate if juppe is one . 
  do the two have a deal ? 
  also , it 's pretty fucked up that the current president might only get 5th place . 
   i am imprisoned for a crime i did not even commit . 
  `` attempted murder '' . 
  relevant simpsons-quote . 
  that they never sucessfuly commited an act of terrorism before does n't mean they were n't suspected trying . 
   but eu are anti-european , undemocratic globalists :d we had a post here a few days ago that heavily implied george soros has similiar influence on the eu parliament . 
  ( [ here 's the thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54vmo7/leaked_document_reveals_hungarianamerican/ ) ) so wether the uk is in the eu or not , they have american billionairs with influence on their goverment either way . 
  there is really nothing positive anout eastern european brain drain . 
  the emigration from there will likely fuck the area up in the coming decades . 
  and poland does n't need young people ? 
  people like to claim trump means the us in on direct way to becoming ideocracy , but reading stuff like this makes me think europe has a massive head start . 
   the terrorists win as soon as we direct our anger toward moderate muslims instead of at the terrorists themselves man , who writes this nonsense ? 
  the goal of the terrorist is to turn europe into muslim states , not for the europeams to give up their values . 
  if the europeans turn there anger to the moderate muslims and throw them all out , the terrorists will lose . 
   only thing stopping this from happening is europeans themselves pretty sure the chinese have their own interesst in africa and would be very able to stop this . 
  and so would the americans be . 
  also the africans themselves of course .
