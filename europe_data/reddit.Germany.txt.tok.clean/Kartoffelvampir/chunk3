  the demographic situation is way different than it was during colonism . 
  seriously , why do you think this could happen ? 
  this is n't the 19th century . 
  african countries colonizing europe and ethnically cleanse it just as likely now , if not more so . 
   i like to call them octupi , arms everywhere and an ink cloud hiding their true ideas . 
  your description makes them sound like bond or comic book villains, 
   like rocket , autobahn , jet plane , prototype assault rifle except the autobahn maybe , the credit ca n't really be given to the political leadership for that kind of inventions - it has to go to the scientist they employed . 
  i actually thought about including wernher von braun , but disregarded it in favour of benz ( whose invention had a wider range of civilian use . ), 
  you are right . 
  i honestly did n't know that . 
  i wanted to keep it at 10 people . 
  i choose otto i. as political leader , because he ended 150 years or so of raids in europe , among other things . 
  of course , feel free to make more suggestions - that was just my picks . 
  * ** otto i. , the great , ** for ending the hungarian raids in europe * ** martin luther , ** for ending catholic dominance * ** johannes gutenberg ** , for inventing the printing press * ** ~ ~ leonhard euler ~ ~ and carl friedrich gauss ** , for contributing tremendously to mathematics * ** alexander von humboldt ** , same for biology * ** johann sebastian bach ** , ** ludwig van beethoven ** , ** wolfgang amadeus mozart ** for music * ** karl benz ** for building the first practical automobile * ** otto von bismarck ** , for uniting germany , using his diplomatic abilities to avoid a war between the european superpowers afterwards , and popular demand btw , there was a show in the uk called * greatest britons * , which spawned spin-offs in other countries . 
  wikipedia has a [ list for them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greatest_britons_spin-offs ) . 
  well , obviously . 
  real health-problems appear if there are widespread marriages between first or second cousins . 
  that can happen if the population is * very * small or if that is a cultural thing ( in which case the size of the population is irrelevant ) . 
  if the population is higher than , say , 100 ' 000 and people avoid marrying persons they share a great-grandparent with , than there should n't really appear any serious health problems . 
  from the article :  `` it would not be a significant factor as long as the space travellers come home or interact with other humans at the end of the 200 year period . '' that number is refering specifically for multigenerational space travel , who create a joined colony with other such space ships . 
  so , not the best example . 
  seriously . 
  the human starting population was about 30000 people . 
  by his thinking , literally every human in the world would be an `` degenerate inbred '' . 
  edit : checked wikipedia on the topic of [ paleodemography ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paleodemography ) :  such models [ dna sequencing ] suggest a human effective population size of the order of 10,000 individuals for the late pleistocene . 
  late pleistocene is about 100.000-10 .000 bc . 
  that was on 15.07.20 ** 15 ** . 
  a funny coincidence , however . 
  not just that . 
  the `` pirate speech '' was popularized by an actor who came from south west england , and based his speech on his home dialect ( so called [ west country english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_country_english ) ) . 
  so , the people there do n't speak like pirates , the pirates speak like them . 
  and now you know a bit more . 
  it 's not satire . 
  it 's a single butcher in a 20 ' 000 people town doing a marketing-gag by letting people choose which measurment they want . 
  the people in this thread threw this way out of proportion . 
  i guess the [ landsknechte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landsknecht ) fit your description , an units of mercenary pikesman during the 15th/16th century . 
  if you search youtube for `` landsknechtslieder '' you find a lot of songs both from there time and and later ones with similar style . 
  is n't le pen actually leading to polls for the first round ? 
  would surprise me if she did n't get to the second . 
   get jogi l\u00f6w to guard your crown jewels he will probably just scratch them and then smell his fingers . 
  not pictured : [ the empire of charles v. ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_v,_holy_roman_emperor#/media/file:empire-roman-emperor-charles-v.jpg ), 
  i think the problem with the question is less the geographical issue , and more the lack of general knowledge on the history of that region . 
  but since the kazakh khanate shares the name , the language and most of the land with the modern state , i say it 's legit . 
  at least in the same way the kingdom of poland , for example , is the prototype of the modern state . 
  the consequences might not be so unforeseeable if the eu would make preparations for brexit , instead of avoiding the issue to not appear defeatistic . 
   1000 vs 600 i really expected a higher ratio with the words `` drown out '', 
   `` to imagine that investigations could have been ordered on fillon or marine le pen is completely absurd because it would be illegal , '' justice minister jean-jacques urvoas told a newspaper on sunday . 
  and of course nobody ever does illegal thinks .

  assuming he does , what would happen to the republican candidacy ? 
  and yet , our leftwing parties want to have more doctors in germany at the expanse of east european countries . 
  what a bunch of assholes . 
   those who can not learn from history are condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past into all eternity . 
  the problem with that quote is : while history is a large enough topic to justify most any politics , people usualy are ignorant about 80 % of it . 
  there are a lot of examples in history that teach you not to let muslims in your country , but since `` history '' for the idiots around here solely revolves around national socialism , there are to stupid to actually learn any lessons from , say , the muslim slave trade in the mediterranean area , the havok brouhgt by tamerlan or the fate of the coptic egypts . 
   they could be the biggest after election party with 25 % and that would change nothing compared to winning 5 % . 
  while your main argument is correct , it makes a difference whether a party unaligned to the two main-blocks gets 5 % or 25 % , at least in a represential parliament . 
  with 25 % , it gets difficult to impossible to have any ruling-coalition except a grand coalition , and even that gets difficult , depending on the party-landscape . 
  see the opinion polls in the netherlands , for example - they need at least 5 parties to build a majority-coalition without the pvv . 
  and that does n't matter because violent crime against police and white people isokey-dokey ? 
  what makes you think the comments are coordinated ? 
  the system has an obvious flaw , and people can realise that flaw independent from each other . 
  also , people in germany have proven countless times that they eat up any bullshit story if it 's packed as far-right-violence . 
  remember the dead refugee in dresden , when everyone screamed nazi and it was his refugee-roommate ? 
  people do n't care about the investigation when it fits in there worldview , and those who decide whether a self-proclaimed victim of far-right violence can stay usually are the kind of people who eat that shit up . 
  in 2015 , there where 1,408 acts of far-right violence and 1,608 acts of far-left violence . 
  source : [ the guardian ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/germany-extremist-violence-far-right-left-islamist ) so , its not a `` silly question '' , but a very good one , since the left is more violent . 
  you mentioned brexit and trump , which is the key here . 
  both were considered really unlikely by the betting market and both won . 
  people who bet on them to happen made quite the money with them , now people bet on the right-wing-candidate in other elections hoping the same will happen . 
  remember , the odds are n't created by professional political analysts . 
  by your definition , the early soviet-union was facist ( if you miss the nationalistic and religious aspect . 
  has she been put into court ? 
  i mean , she admits being a murderer, 
  branding herself as an outsider ( in the sense of not being part of the ruling class ) or non-establishment is n't really grotesque if here father was that as well . 
  she 's not a casual though , she is definitly a career-politican . 
  well , they were socialist . 
  people who say otherwise tend to use a wrong definition of socialism .

  that canada was n't polled does n't mean the numbers there are better . 
  i 'd guess their numbers are similiar to the rest . 
  calling it `` ourope '' implies there is a `` we '' . 
  there is n't one . 
   heinz-christian strache in october spoke of an `` uncontrolled influx of migrants alien to our culture who seep into our social welfare system '' , adding that `` civil war in the medium-term [ is ] not unlikely '' . 
   gertrude said she remembered a civil war from when she was seven years old and saw a dead body for the first time - something she said she could never forget . 
  [ ... ]  `` a shiver ran down my spine and i thought to myself : this should not even be mentioned , or even thought of , '' she said . 
  yeah , ignoring the possibilty of an civil war will not making it go away . 
  not historically . 
  around 1900 , europe 's population ( including the european part of russia ) was equal to chinas - and yet world war 1 had likely less deaths than the taiping revolution . 
   wars in europe have been statistically bloodier than wars elsewhere in the world . 
  where they really ? 
  apart from the difficulties in getting the data , the estimates i 've seen suggest otherwise . 
  according to wikipedia 's [ list of wars by death toll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_by_death_toll ) , the most bloody wars in history where either chinese civil wars , or where heavily fought in china ( like ww2 or the mongol wars ) . 
  what if someone publishs a story he invented but turns out to be true ? 
  can you proof that thesis ? 
  because i never found european history much more violent then non-european . 
  if you think europe was one of the most violent and unstable regions on the planet than you really need some lessons in non-european history . 
  as someone whose dad is german and whose mother is german , i do n't consider you german , and you never will be . 
  another poll from just last month had the sweden democrats as strongest party with 26.8 % .
