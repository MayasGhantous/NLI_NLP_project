  moving . 
  who ? 
  nothing , i guess . 
  give them a proper boat , 200 wood , 200 food and 200 gold and let them start in the meditarrean . 
  can you explain the low quality argument ? 
  of course we are a continent ... 
  soon . 
   ss uniforms were made by hugo boss , btw . 
  widespread myth which is only partly true . 
  hugo boss was just one of many other companies supplying the wehrmacht with uniforms . 
  they did n't play a big role or even designed the uniforms . 
  i really like the estonian colors , although it would be so much nicer with a scandinavian cross . 
  otherwise ... 
  i 'm sorry guys , but [ this ] ( http://www.kbismarck.com/kwarflag.jpg ) is my favorite i guess . 
  no political bullshit involved , just the flag . 
  just finally decide which side you 're going for , it ca n't be that hard !, 
  either you choose us germans , the root of the germanic ( and therefor wealthy , nice and amazing ) countries , the beacon of europe and worshippers of our [ holy lord ] ( http://donthatethegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-david-hasselhoff.jpg ) , or you choose ... france . 
  that 's bad to hear , buddy . 
  now gib sudetenland . 
  you do n't ? 
   well , our anglo blood is pretty similar to you germans . 
  anglo blood is actually german , mostly . 
   but we have the best beers that 's a blatant lie and you should be punished for spreading hostile misinformations . 
  ireland 's weather is pretty nice this time of the year , i heard . 
  well , that was a lie . 
  german here , i can relate . 
   i do n't say that the typhoon is the worst aircraft ever made . 
  no , but you literally said `` the typhoon is not a good aircraft '' , which is very wrong . 
  that 's my entire point . 
   against the rafale it 's not a good aircraft . 
  below 3,000 meters , yes . 
  every aircraft of this tier has strenghs and weaknesses . 
  for example the typhoon 's helmet-assisted hud is top notch , while the rafale 's is lackluster compared to other generation 4-5 fighters . 
  french website ? 
  no , thanks . 
  btw : i do n't doubt that the rafale is an excellent aircraft : i just oppose your `` typhoon is not a good aircraft '' argument - which is utter horsecrap . 
  source : he 's played games . 
  please ... 
  this is not how a rotating planet works . 
  ... yet . 
  yeah , shame on those dutch people , could n't even hold off the wehrmacht . 
  actually , dutch forces inflicted heavy casualties to fallschirmj\u00e4ger and luftwaffe . 
  belgium on the other hand ... 
  and no , only at full moon . 
  i 'm living near flensburg ( most northern town of germany ) for now 28 years , except two years where i lived near papenburg ( border to the netherlands ) and i 've never heard of it . 
  what the heck is your region of germany ? 
  the typhoon is probably the best dogfighter , it 's meant and built to fight the ( extreme maneuverable ) mig-29 and now su-27 . 
  you ca n't really compare it with a f22 ( air superiority ) or a f35 ( mult-purpose ) . 
  f35 is multipurpose . 
  f22 is interception/air superiority . 
  that 's where the undertaker lives . 
  can you please reach me the salt ? 
  it seems you got plenty of it . 
  putting progressives in quotation , how edgy . 
   they also agree that the eu should not invade russia [ yet ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/3/35/country-balls-parenting.png/revision/latest?cb=20151024124902 ) . 
  `` germany and france will never cooperate '' - literally everybody from charlemagne up until 1945 . 
  no , their do . 
  tree-fiddy ? 
  you are united when you have a common enemy . 
  my experience with austrians is that many have a serious minority-complex when it comes to the relations with germany . 
  it actually does . 
  ask polish kavalrymen . 
  one thing that made me think : is it normal that the danish group leader asks a marksman to throw a grenade , instead of ordering him ? 
  came across pretty out of place . 
  i think at this point more militaries/police uinits are using 416 's than ar-15 's . 
  at least in europe . 
  the g36 scandal was a giant hoax from the german mod to supply hk with a new contract . 
  nobody ever ( militaries , police units , civilian shooters ) complained about heating issues with the g36 . 
  thanks , merkel . 
  this sentence needs to be printed on posters . 
  mace ... what ? 
  sorry , i meant mordor . 
  belgium would be a part of it . 
  you do n't want belgium being a part of it . 
  the huns are on it again ! '', 
  and smell like english . 
  it 's a mess . 
  so it 's not only people who carry a burden . 
  who said that ? 
   but what i know is that countries , literally objects , do n't commit human rights violations , people do . 
  so germany is free now ? 
  no more nazi accusations on everything we do anymore ? 
  i know , right ? 
  it 's amazing !, 
   just stay on your side of the maginot line . 
  who needs lines , if we got belgium ? 
  creepiest possible answer given . 
  and you 'll always be . 
  i wonder where these german minorities come from . 
  like as if poland actually took german land a while ago . 
  has brussels impregnated british justice ? 
  like pregnant 15 year old lads partying in las vegas ? 
  triggered . 
  found the austrian !, 
  he said he was talking about the recognition , not the genocide itself . 
  better vote for ~ ~ trump ~ ~ ~ ~ npd ~ ~ ~ ~ le pen ~ ~ ~ ~ orban ~ ~ afd next time . 
   nothing happened in the last 100 years and it will be the same next 100 years just quoting for reference . 
  yep , using a plugin named `` proxtube '' . 
  pretty easy , it still sucks though . 
  not all germans are swabians .
