  to feel schadenfreude is petty ... 
  yes , i will indeed by happy if we get rid of england and welcome the scots . 
   our decisions need not concern you . 
  see , that 's exactly my point . 
  in these times there is no lone way anymore for a major european country . 
  except for the uk , apparently . 
   i do n't feel schadenfreude when i see germany failing . 
  maybe that 's because germany does n't fail . 
  it 's not hate , just schadenfreude . 
  the british government never shared the goal of a unified europe and torpedoed every attempt towards it . 
  now a large portion of englishmen fell for the populistic brainwashery and there 's a bit of schadenfreude , yeah . 
   techno barbarians [ i got one !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/9hw_fdmxw6a?t=18s ), 
  plus , you piss off the english . 
  that 's a nice bonus . 
  found the edgy teenager !, 
  well , the facepalm-meter is at a rising george bush jr. x4 currently . 
   i ca n't wait to read your ~ ~ arguments ! ~ ~ feelings !, 
  ftfy . 
  sssh , germany 's history began 1933 . 
  just play along . 
  not nearly as tasteless and dangerous as the people they are making fun of . 
  sell it to france ? 
   devaluing the euro , benefiting german exports ? 
  check . 
  common argument , unfortunately . 
  the german gouvernment has no control over the value of the euro , that 's what the ecb is for . 
  of course there 's gon na be a crapton of windmills !, 
  if fully-armed soldiers are flooding my state , it 's not a real vote , is it ? 
  i mean , we also can send 200 leopard tanks to jutland and then ask the danish if they wan na vote for us or not . 
   i mean russia the great empire was that sarcasm ? 
  i really hope that was sarcasm . 
  of course you do , you are paid by russia . 
  or bite the hand that made demands , after you deceived the entire eu . 
  no , of course not . 
  i mean some kind of `` hey guys , we had to remove some shit here , please stick to the rules '' post . 
  low effort comments , memes and excessive circlejerking : this is especially enforced in news submissions and political debates . 
  that is pretty vague and stretchable . 
  so be it . 
   well , i gave the reason . 
  on request , yes . 
  that is , if i did n't miss a earlier post of you . 
  thing is , if you ( plural ) do this unnoticed , how can we be sure that nothing gets removed ? 
  about the low-quality gifs : i understand that they are forbidden , but only as posts , not as comments , i guess ? 
  for the `` talking shit about the dead '' , i did n't see the comments to have an opinion on if the mod 's actions were needed or not . 
  but if you delete user 's comments , at last tell us and give us a reason . 
  if you do n't , this place gets the smell of censorship and `` guided enviroment '' really quickly . 
  thing is , they did n't delete their posts , the mods did it . 
  for me it does n't really matter what these people said , but straight deleting their posts without any info is no bueno at all . 
  was n't neccessary . 
  disciplinary threats from their officers and the amount of regular soldiers did the job . 
  snipers were to part of that thought process . 
  the impact of snipers was n't big enough to change tactics on the battlefield . 
  sharpshooters have been a thing since musket times . 
  snipers had nothing to do with the officers decision to stop all attempts of such truces . 
  i prefer the video way more than usual pictures , which i 've seen before . 
  i 'm pretty happy op posted the vid . 
  sad , upsetting , but unfortunately these people are getting more and more ground . 
  where did you learn that , call of duty ? 
  just went through your posts , you are some special snowflake , are n't you ? 
  no , after that there were another 3 years of senseless butchering and humanitarian catastrophes , the result was another war with more dead people and more senseless destruction . 
  in political terms , `` progressive '' is the opposite of `` conservative '' . 
  taking your example , being against abortion would indeed be conservative , because it did n't exist in the past . 
  you say progressives as if thats something bad . 
  you started a memewar , you 'll get a memewar !, 
  i wish i would 've seen your comment earlier , would 've saved 5-6 minutes of my life . 
  * twice, 
  somebody call a fox news camera team , so much drama here !, 
  you think the mp5 is a modern firearm ? 
  low-velocity 9mm-pistol-caliber smg that has massive problems penetrating even regular sheets of kevlar-vests ? 
  apart from regular police missions , this firearm ( although technically very reliable ) has barely any serious purpose in military roles anymore . 
  what do you think is the reason for fn and hk to develope the p90 and mp7 pdw 's ? 
  that 's why they classified turkey as a `` yellow '' ( light ) country . 
  it 's neither as green as other nato states , nor as red as fucking somalia . 
  okay , for real now . 
  what the fuck is your problem ? 
  are you jealous of syrians who found a job in germany ? 
  if you are a pole and you really wan na work here , you are free to do so . 
  a syrian has way bigger hurdles to live here than a pole . 
  and stop this `` it was all planned '' tinfoil hat crap , please . 
  i hate to say this , but you guys are notorious for that and it drives down serious discussions all the time . 
  nah , it 's more like the german gouvernment deciding not to repell refugees , because that would violate the human rights convention . 
  do n't argue with facts , emotions are the thing now . 
  okay , i just do n't get one thing : how is that off-topic ? 
  two conflicting head of states are waving with their nuclear arsenal , the outcome could have a serious impact for the entire globe , let alone europe , and this is off-topic ? 
  and why are the following threads not `` off-topic '' then ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5pa1s0/donald_trump_inauguration_vladimir_putin/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6dfqna/trump_tells_stunned_nato_leaders_they_need_to_pay/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5czsi1/trump_and_putin_vow_to_tackle_isis_together_as/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ptn94/is_anyone_else_sick_of_the_recent_laugh_at_north/ i do n't get how this can be off-topic . 
  what do i have to do with your grandparents ? 
  que ? 
  so ... how about little green german men in east prussia then ? 
  i mean ... you can recognise is or not ... 
  i always knew that the fdp lads are direct vassals of the industry , but this is just disgusting . 
  i wonder if he had contact to moscow before . 
  if that 's right , i guess k\u00f6nigsberg is n't lost at all . 
  that 's the law of the jungle - if you fancy joining russians going with that , have fun in your second-world country with an extra portion corruption . 
  you are not a fan of using proper arguments in a meaningful discussion , are you ? 
  how so ? 
  germany occupied countries in ww2 and has to pay for it by land ... soviet union occupied countries in ww2 and gains land ? 
  where is the logic ? 
  i agree .
