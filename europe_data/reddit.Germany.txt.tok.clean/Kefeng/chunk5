  first target will be norway , i guarantee it . 
  dobrinth is bringing the argument `` germans do n't have to pay '' , which is not even an argument for me . 
  that only means that `` someone else '' has to pay . 
  this is selfish and plain unfair . 
  our economy also profits from foreign cars and trucks passing germany . 
  true that . 
  victor orban , nigel farage . 
  i do n't like this . 
  i do n't know why you think i 'm british , but i 'm german . 
  but that does not mean that i 'm speaking for the leopard only because i 'm german . 
  the challenger is also a excellent tank , but it relies more on it 's armor and is less versatile . 
  and yes , the pl-01 is just a prototype yet . 
  i would like to see how this tank can handle a rheinmetall 120mm gun without problems . 
  also , the active camouflage against infrared sensors require huge amounts of energy , making the camouflage limited in time . 
  plus , the attacker can still switch to radar guided arms . 
  not speaking of ied 's , mines and other passive tank killers , which are eating light tanks for breakfast . 
  we 'll see if they can deliver . 
  on paper it sounds great , so did the german [ tank destroyer with 2 guns ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vt_tank ) or the [ russian tsar tank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsar_tank ) . 
  only time will tell . 
  oh , dear god . 
  the pl-01 is a light ( ! ), 
  tank concept . 
  it looks stealthy , but it is n't in any way . 
  it just looks like a shaped grey brick . 
  you ca n't be serious , saying you think it 's beautyful , mate . 
  plus : it 's not even comparable with mbt 's . 
   with germany producing one of the best piece of armor the leopard series excuse me ?!, 
  god , i do n't want to start a youtube-comment-section-which-tank-is-better shitcircle , but there currently is no `` better '' tank than the leopard 2 . 
  and before you even try to say it : [ no , the abrams is a half-leopard , half - `` something '' , gas-turbined waste of money . 
  :p ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_army_trophy ) there is a political reason why we do n't sell as many weapon systems as we could . 
  you guys just sell everything to everyone , including ( and foremost ) weapons to instable third world countires . 
  right , it 's a vision . 
  sorry mister putin , but we already have trouble with `` our '' europe . 
  not gon na work for kazachstan right now . 
  guess i start this with [ american exceptionalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ), 
  if you support the human race you do n't do our planet a favor . 
  you should ask that question to your grandparents . 
  the answer you 'll get is the one you need . 
  yeah , i guess we have to . 
  while other `` big '' nations of europe are sitting in the corner and being huffy . 
  really ? 
  which one ? 
  yes , sorry . 
  klose is by far not the only one who scores for his country . 
  ronaldo on the other hand ... 
  germany , because : * i 'm german * was never a fan of portugese football * christiano ronaldo ( ultra-arrogant , totally overrated - and hyped player ) . 
   unless this game is all about klose vs. ronaldo , then we gon na lose :( . 
  why exactly ? 
  because ronaldo is a `` superstar '' ? 
  like rooney ( 0 goals at wc 's so far ) and messi ( 2010 , cough ) ? 
  `` you 've never seen portugal lose so clear '' . 
  well , sorry for that then , i probably was in a bad mood . 
   this compact remained in place until the infamous schr\u00f6der-fischer regime ( goddamn i despise those guys ) ... 
  sorry , i have to answer to that . 
  yes , that was the first major deployment of german military after wwii ( before they were nearly only active at natural disasters like floods ) . 
  and yes , what the schr\u00f6der gouvernment did was a break of traditions . 
  and this is highly debatable . 
  but i probably would do the same if i were in that position . 
  the bundeswehr went to this conflict together with the nato to stop an ongoing genocide after many attempts through political solutions . 
  it started around 1992 and milosevic did n't stop . 
  the main argument for the greens was `` never auschwitz again '' . 
  and hunted people do n't know borders . 
  it was still a massacre , which would have continued without a intervention . 
  i do n't say the bundeswehr should be free to operate everywhere they want . 
  but this was kind of a emergency case . 
  for afghanistan , it was the first and only `` casus foederis '' , so we had to operate there . 
  interesting stuff : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jskcotm4ms ( unfortunately only in german , i did n't find any versions with english subtitles , sorry ) . 
  thing is : you are a member of the nato . 
  that means , if russia attacks east europe ( poland/baltics ) the nato will help . 
  this includes germany . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  a military engagement must be the last resort . 
  i explained why many germans do n't want to rely simply on one of the powers . 
  yes , what russia did was plain wrong and was a crime . 
  but that does n't mean that following everything the us does and did is the right way . 
   because they feel like they ca n't rely on germany militarily like they can the united states ? 
  no , they are free to do so . 
  and i understand why especially the east-european countries are doing this . 
  although this is sometimes over the top , because they are under protection of the nato , not only the us or germany . 
  but counting on german military engagement is a tough thing . 
  everybody knows why . 
  this weird conversation with you is over for me . 
  i do n't have time for this . 
  what 's your fucking problem , dude ? 
  it 's a opinion . 
  this is a comment section . 
  it 's meant for comments and opinions . 
  you just declare it 's `` worthless '' and a `` shitpost '' because you disagree . 
   no worthwhile content it 's the opinion of one of the millions of germans this article criticises . 
  that 's worthless ? 
  you should see the comment secions of german media like der spiegel . 
  these are filled with ultra-toxic pro-russian mob 's . 
  it 's just so obvious . 
  @the downvoters : feel free to explain why you disagree , i would like to know . 
   that is the strategy of one of the most important members of the eu and nato , ** whose place should be clearly on the western side of the conflict ** , not somewhere between washington and moscow . 
  apoligies , i 'm one of these nasty germans that think we should n't unconditionally trust any of these powers . 
  sorry for not sucking up the stories of iraq , abu ghraib and nsa/gchq , etc. 
  like other eu nations do ( uk , poland ) . 
   the times when germans could lead the european union or be a serious partner inside the nato structures are gone . 
  that 's unfortunate .
