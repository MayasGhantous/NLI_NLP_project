  masses of vehicles ? 
  check . 
  the needed recources ? 
  check . 
  what do you mean by `` better equipment '' ? 
  does a hk416 kill better or more than a ak-101 ? 
  is this a video game you are talking about ? 
   they are not a threat . 
  says who ? 
  you ?!, 
  you proved to me that you have no idea about military basics and terms . 
  it seems it 's just a game you are talking about where the badass leopard is of course winning against that old t-80 mummy . 
  or where the complete german airspace is covered by 2 sysfla units and some gepard tanks . 
  i want to try to put this nicely . 
  it 's a `` what if '' discussion about a possible war ... 
  which is very interesting . 
  but if there is a guy , just saying `` russia would lose because of [ insert meaningless argument here ] and spreads `` facts '' which are just untrue , then it 's a waste of time . 
   also , france has 4 aircraft-carriers and russia has 1 . 
  plus 63 submarines . 
  yeah , outproduce in what ? 
  2 years ? 
  also russia has a shitton of strategic bombers for our factories . 
  do we have any strategic bombers ? 
  russia has a very , very high number of reserve equipment , especially tanks . 
  what do we do when our 400 tanks are gone ? 
  they have over 15.000 . 
  it does n't matter if one leopard 2 can kill five t-80 's . 
  they have more . 
   russia is n't a threat to us , period . 
  period ? 
  like `` we have the maginot line , the germans ca n't come through '' period ? 
  i think this is really simple and ignorant/naive thinking . 
  russia 's military is a brute force . 
  you can look up the numbers [ here ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=germany&amp;country2=russia&amp;submit=compare+countries ) for further information . 
  thanks , but i noticed that i 'm getting rickrolled ' . 
  i wanted to listen to the song anyways , cause it 's amazing . 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
   it 's exactly what you want . 
  thanks for deciding that for me , but i want the opinion of the people here . 
  please understand that my question is `` what would be '' and not `` what is '' . 
  thanks in advance . 
  this is exactly why i ask . 
  yeah , i remember when everybody was pissed at poland , because they bought american equipment with eu money after 2004 . 
  touche . 
  afaik the austrian army has a submarine in the bodensee ( lake constance ) . 
  quantity is a quality of itself . 
  this is a major factor . 
  is europe united yet ? 
  and still we have a `` national '' anthem . 
  also i said `` what would be '' and not `` what is '' . 
  i answered it below :  i myself ? 
  but many others would say munich , frankfurt or cologne i bet . 
  yes , hamburg is in my ( relative ) near . 
  i live at the danish border . 
  and no , hamburg is the second largest city and a major factor in terms of economy , society and media . 
  bonn was always a `` grey mouse '' like we germans tend to say . 
  it 's a bit like wanne-eickel or castrop-rauxel . 
  when you hear it , you just feel `` meh '' . 
  we also need hoverboards and diet-pizza , but this is not gon na happen . 
   i love both forests and clean , economic energy sources ( which nuclear is ) . 
  until you have to stash the garbage . 
  but we have lower saxony for that , right ? 
  wow . 
  that came faster than i thought . 
  wrong answer . 
  i 'd agree if you would have said your weissbier is the best . 
  but not bier in general . 
  that is amazing . 
  i myself ? 
  but many others would say munich , frankfurt or cologne i bet . 
  another thing only germans know : we actually do n't hate bavaria . 
  of course , they are arrogant , weird , old-fashioned , stubborn and smelly - and they are guilty of the weirdest stereotypes of germans in the world ( lederhosen ) . 
  but the landscape if awesome . 
  and the gelassenheit ( tranquility ) down there is something that many , many germans strive for . 
  this is why we love our forests and hate nuclear energy . 
  did n't want to , too many of them on reddit . 
  many of us do n't see berlin as our capital . 
  berlin is kind of a experimental ground for art-students and indie-film directors . 
  is it bad if i do n't know what cantonese is ? 
  you would be a bad australian , disliking the esc . 
  it 's not like there are only a few people who speak that language . 
  67.5 of the 44 million ukrainians are speaking it according to wikipedia . 
  that 's what i mean with `` developed '' . 
  no need to apoligise for mcdonalds , dude . 
  most of us like it . 
  you guys are shipping worse things as this . 
   the uk on the other hand has had huge success with movies like gravity and james bond , or shows like doctor who , top gear , and the office . 
  and germany is exporting movies and shows like `` das leben der anderen '' , `` der untergang '' , `` kommissar rex '' , `` derrick '' etc. 
  every country is exporting culture , but it 's not even comparable to the american influence . 
  american media is permanently present . 
  i think they have 4 types of pronouncing the letter `` a '' . 
  horrible . 
  til english is sometimes just as unnessessary complicated as german . 
  hm , i wonder why . 
  i do n't think it would be a waste of time , since ukrainian is a well developed language afaik . 
  yeah , but `` inflamed '' sounds like the exact opposite of `` flamed '' . 
  at least for me . 
  yeah , it seems some of these words ( unflexible ... ) are relics from past times . 
  yes , but in german there is no difference between `` website '' and `` webpage '' . 
  you 're welcome .
