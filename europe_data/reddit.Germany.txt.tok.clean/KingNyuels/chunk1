you are welcome !, 
  you know that she is cancellor since 2005 ? 
  and two things : can you explain me how she is responsible for the refugees crisis ? 
  refugees are able to enter the federal republic of germany since for ever . 
  and although its said that she is the most powerful person in germany , she gives the guideline for the bundestag and ca n't just decide everything by herself . 
   he/she can save up months worth of free money there  and of course nothing stops them from simply going back for more in 99 % of all cases , those economic migrants are instantly send back ( if they are from a [ safe country ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicherer_herkunftsstaat_ ( deutschland ) ) - so almost every asylum seeker is from a country where he is political persecuted and so on ) . 
  so there is really no possibility to do this in germany . 
  and : you ca n't save up money here - all of the money they get , they have to use . 
   all of this before taxes if i am correct - here they have to pay taxes , too . 
   enabled a million immigrants to enter germany can you explain to me in detail how ? 
  i mean ... immigrants are able to enter the federal republic of germany since ... ever . 
  only because she said we would do anything to help unlike many other countries ? 
  * if in reception centre : medical services , pocket money ( 135 euro per month ) , standard benefits ( clothes , etc. ), 
  * if not , they can payout `` standard benefits '' and get then 216 euro per month ( all per one grown up - minors are different handled ) and : before a asylum seeker gets this benefits , he has to pay from his own money or income . 
  so basically they get around half of unemployment benefit to one fourth . 
  and a lot less than minimum wage ( 8,50 $ / 8,84 $ per hour of work - now/01 .01.2017 ) i ca n't say how much they get in eastern europe , but it has to be a horrible low amount . 
  ** sources ** : [ bundesregierung.de ] ( https://www.bundesregierung.de/webs/breg/de/themen/fluechtlings-asylpolitik/4-faq/_node.html ) ( it is really a good ** recommendation ** to * read * it ), 
  source : https://www.bka.de/de/aktuelleinformationen/statistikenlagebilder/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/pks2015/pks2015_node.html for clarification : `` ausl\u00e4nderrechtliche verst\u00f6\u00dfe '' -  unauthorized entry of the country , unauthorized stay , ... 
   1 for berlin that is because berlin got ( n ) one regierungsbezirk . 
  germany is/was `` divided '' into 19/32 + '' [ regierungsbezirke ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/regierungsbezirke_deutschlands_1981-2008.svg ) '' . 
  okay . 
  you are right . 
  11 % of all deaths `` only '' . 
  in comparison of ( only highways ) it is ( considering the ` no limit ' ) still [ ` quite well ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autobahn#safety ) to the usa . 
  well the autobahn is [ one of the safer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/road_traffic_safety#statistics ) `` high speed roads '' ( e.g. 
  deaths per million inhabitants : 41 , while usa ( 103 ) , france ( 51 ) have a higher percentage although limited speedways ) & nbsp ; nrw : the amount of deaths on the autobahn increased - total number constant ( 523 ) - main reason is still speeding while the second reason ( distraction ) : amount of smartphone violations increased by 11 % ( 164.000 ) - smartphone used ( held on ear ) increased by 40 % ( 22.000 ), 
  wait for may 14th . 
  nrw is going to vote ( ~ 17,9 million citizens - do n't know how many eligible to vote ) . 
  100 % votes that counted ( if i 'm right ) ? 
  - would be party record !, 
  what about the high amount of mathematicians ? 
  a lot `` responsible '' for ( chances for ) accomplishments in information technology ( e.g. ), 
   einstein well ... he was born in germany ? 
  ulm ( baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ) ( as part of the kaiserreich ) . 
  [ yeah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm ) : /, 
   how often has he gone bankrupt ? 
  ** times . 
  he could have made more money with investing it into an index fund of s&p 500 and could have sit on his hands . 
  here ) for me , too !, 
   my father can speak/read dutch very well though . 
  you are correct . 
  germany 's biggest bundesland `` people-wise '' ( ~ 17,5-18 million ) . 
  hungary 's ( red , white , green ) flag is north rhine-westphalia 's / nordrhein-westfalen 's ( green , white , red ) turned . 
  the [ `` dienstflagge '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/flag_of_north_rhine-westphalia_%28state%29.svg ) - version got the coat if arms on it : rhine on the left , saxon steed on the right and `` lippische rose '' in the middle lower part . 
  my opinion is still to not expell him from the afd . 
  because then he will get to his `` real '' job : ** history teacher ** . 
  i 'm not an expert ... but is n't this quite the opposite ? 
  as they break the '' [ reddit content policy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy ) '' - do you report them to the reddit admins , too ? 
  what is wrong with giving loving people the equal right ? 
  this does n't mean you have to marry a dude ... they let you live , you should let them ... with equal rights . 
  you fucking did n't !, 
  consider youself banned from the glorius kingdom of nrw . 
  no karneval ever for you !, 
  37 % of the 890.000 to 1.091.894 / 1.153.484 easy-registrations were syrians ( [ source ] ( https://m.bpb.de/politik/innenpolitik/flucht/218788/zahlen-zu-asyl-in-deutschland ) is bpb ) but keep in mind : the number you quoted is the ones for `` suspects '' in all cases ( so `` foreigner '' - exclusive cases are counted in , too ), 
  crime increased by around 2000 cases overall in 2015 , which equals nearly 0 % * rise compared to the previous year ( 2014 ) if you filter out all `` ausl\u00e4nderrechtliche verst\u00f6\u00dfe '' ( being in germany without passport e.g. 
  or being in germany although you got your asylum denied , etc. 
  we could start from someone friendly . 
  so we do n't have to go all the way through poland e.g. 
  would be more efficient . 
  while i agree with this idea , i do n't agree with your reason . 
  do n't talk/fear terrorists , because that is all they want . 
  they are `` winning '' by spreading fear , no matter how many `` we '' kill of them . 
  sure sz might be a little conservative , but overall quite objective and does n't follow the `` guideline '' `` propaganda sells '' . 
  yeah sure , if you follow anything from `` axel springer '' ( n24 , bild , welt ) ... you are correct . 
  [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/eu_oct_and_omr_map_en.png ) of eu oct and omr, 
  if you were born in the rural districts near the border to the netherlands yes , - sarcasm aside - it pretty much feels like a german dialect . 
  that is bullshit . 
  the bounty/bonus is n't new . 
  it is cheaper to give them money to leave the country by themselves than `` deport '' them . 
  definitely fortunatly !, 
  - ( if that would be 100 % the case ( mali , afghanistan ) ) . 
  doing nothing  dying in war ( consider : in both cases it costs money ), 
  are `` stereotype '' - jokes about poles stealing something counted ? 
  then i heard i think one in the last 5 years . 
  banana-count !, 
  pshh - spoiler : germany is going to win the cup . 
  you are listing `` ruhrgebiet '' , `` d\u00fcsseldorf '' , `` k\u00f6ln '' as seperate metropolitan areas although they all belong to [ rhine-ruhr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhine-ruhr ) that would place it @ `` most populous '' third e.g. 
  maybe you do n't mean `` metropolis '' ? 
  the current coalition is cdu-csu-spd ... 
  if the question is meant as `` viable '' like in `` how possible '' then i have to disagree you . 
  if it is meant as `` viable '' like in `` how valuable '' ( `` getting things done '' - not !, 
  `` how good their political orientation is '' ) then i can partially agree you . 
  considering the cancellor is n't such a powerful person ( mainly : setting the guideline ) like e.g. 
  the u.s. president * i * do n't think it is a big downside . 
  and even if two ( or more ) parties cooperate , the party with the most votes still has a bigger influence on deciding than the one with less votes . 
  so the `` voting public '' still got a huge influence . 
  finland , sweden , netherlands , luxembourg , cyprus , ireland i think he missed two ( three with ireland ) more , 
  guyane * or french guiana - yes , because its an oversea region of france . 
  and liechtenstein : i think as of the same reason switzerland is n't colored , it is n't part of the eu . 
  `` bierwagen '' and bierexport for sure and ** br\u00e4u ** ( e.g. 
  in `` coganbr\u00e4u '' ) - the \u00e4 as umlaut is german uniqueness . 
  answering this rhetoric question : [ cogan ] ( http://cogan.it/en/export/ ) !, 
  the text on it is german though . 
  was n't it like 1 million ? 
  half of the city burned !, 
  probably because its currently not windy outside . 
   i think so , yes then you would have understood me . 
   i found no serious source that maria l. is the daughter of an eu official / politician ? 
  thats because i search with google-germany which gives * me * mainly german right-wing sources or exaggerations . 
  whats wrong about asking for a source ?
