   you would rather talk about some russian girl who made a false rape report against refuges . 
  aguywitharaygun said :  remember that politician 's daughter that was murdered ? 
  yeah . 
  i ** thought ** he meant the russian girl . 
  which were fake news/fake info . 
  then someone told me that he meant maria l. , and there i never said that this was n't real . 
  serious question : can you read ? 
  was maria russian ? 
  maria l. was real , i said nothing against it . 
  the russian girl `` that was kidnapped and raped '' was fake news . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-eu-35413134 http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/27/europe/russia-germany-berlin-rape/ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-german-girl-admits-making-up-claim-she-was-raped-by-refugees-in-berlin-a6845256.html http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/berlin-girl-13-admits-making-claims-she-was-raped-by-migrants-germany-1541242 ... 
  ah , i thought he meant the ** fake news ** about this russian girl `` that was kidnapped and raped '' . 
  i found no serious source that maria l. is the daughter of an eu official / politician ? 
  was n't it fake news ? 
   hate crime ( antisemitism ) it was n't [ antisemitic motivated ] ( https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/lgs/wuppertal/lg_wuppertal/j2016/23_ns_50_js_156_14_26_15_urteil_20160118.html ) :  die tat selbst nicht antisemitisch motiviert war & nbsp ;  bump it up a lot germany 's law does n't `` know '' hate crimes as such . 
  they are either treated as political motivated crime or are indirectly used to determine the harshness of another crime ( e.g. 
  / u/dakmak do n't know who downvoted you just for asking a question , so upvoted to balance it out . 
  [ yes , they did n't ] ( https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/lgs/wuppertal/lg_wuppertal/j2016/23_ns_50_js_156_14_26_15_urteil_20160118.html ) : ~ ~ they even got convicted for a [ greater case of arson ] ( https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/lgs/wuppertal/lg_wuppertal/j2016/23_ns_50_js_156_14_26_15_urteil_20160118.html ) even though the building was only minimal damaged . ~ ~, 
  they did n't got suspended sentences - they even got convicted for the greater case of arson , even though there was minimal damage to the building ) in germany the imprisonment time/jail sentence is n't as long as in the states . 
  a decade would have been a huge exaggeration and would have never been in any case of ( only ) arson imposed . 
  germany does n't got a deep geological repository . 
  this is * my * main reason against and i still know the benefits and i am not afraid of the plants . 
   the us just have to keep people out  and keeping people out is much easier . 
  how would that be easier ? 
  anything you can argue with ? 
   it kind of served it 's purpose . 
   you do n't have to have border guards that shoots anyone . 
  but ... thats how the wall worked - without it would have been senseless . 
  and it was n't to keep people out , but in . 
  oh - you mean ... like the nsa did ? 
   ecb and germany is against that can you give me a source to that ? 
  ecb lowered the base rate , increased negative interest , ecb [ started buying bounds ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html ) ( germany is by the way in with the biggest debt securities ) although thats against the `` doctrine '' , et cetera ... and i literally found via quick search no information about germany blocking or being against anything like that . 
   germans certainly have opinions on brexit do they not that has economic background . 
   are turks just as german as the norm hell ... a lot of germans are even not just as german as the norm . 
   the eu has free movement as you are bringing in britain into it : britain does n't even belong to the schengen area - `` just '' judicial and police cooperation while border controls still exist . 
  i think they searched for something that is not well known ;-) or they just could n't decide as japan is saleswise a big competitor . 
  yes !, 
  157 visa-free countries - ( followed by sweden with 156 i think ), 
   1000-3000 euros for denied asylum seekers to go home voluntarily its really cheaper . 
  deportation costs more due to payment for cops that escort them . 
   they just go home and come back the next day with different papers or made up identity without papers anyway . 
  you only can get this money , if you already applied for political asylum . 
  if you did this , you also registered your fingerprints and your `` face '' ( photos ) is registered . 
  they could have used [ russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) ) then !, 
   you can always get a new ( temporary ) one from the embassy . 
  if you throw your passport away , like mynicknameisunique suggested - do you really want to go voluntary there and get a new one ? 
   also they ca n't be deported for not having a passport . 
  i did n't said anything else !, 
    petty offence expanding my vocabulary every day - always thought its called crime or felony or something like that aswell . 
  thank you !, 
   i actually looked up the law a bit . 
  ah , did n't knew that . 
  my fault then . 
   to be able to supply some form of official id in this case ( as my reply was to mynicknameisunique ) this wo n't be possible . 
   i 'm not sure officials would even bother with trying to deport an i mean ... first they try to determine whats your home country ( as you are in germany with no passport and seek asylum - which should be easy , if you are eu national ) then : if they `` find '' it : * you wo n't get asylum in germany ( you are from a [ safe country ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicherer_herkunftsstaat_ ( deutschland ) ) ) - as of this it is easier to deport you ( as already done with economic migrants ) * and you commit a crime ( no passport ) if not : * you are `` tolerated '' until found but you are right , you ca n't get deported if you are here with a passport . 
  traveling ! = seeking asylum . 
  eu countries are safe countries . 
  you can travel here with a passport . 
  if you seek asylum , you wo n't get it as an eu citizen . 
  this is a crime to do so ( entering germany without a passport ) - punished i.a. 
  with prison , and as your background can easily be checked you will get easily deported back to your country , as it is a safe country . 
  you still did n't marked austria and hungary then ? 
  [ nope ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutschland#staatsgr.c3.bcndung ), 
   the german empire of 1871 , the weimar republic of 1919 and . 
  the nazi reich . 
  and the [ norddeutscher bund ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/norddeutscher_bund ) ( ` north german confederation ' ), 
  we could use the '' [ bundesdienstflagge ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/flag_of_germany_%28state%29.svg ) '' ( reserved for federal agencies ) then . 
  it uses the coat of arms . 
  the scandal was broken [ in europe ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/abgasskandal#zur_vorgeschichte ) and was n't that small , but got a much larger medial attention as the `` us broke the scandal '' . 
  as italy is n't a federal republic , but a [ unitary state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unitary_state ) its harder to compare . 
  groups of your regions ( [ northwest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northwest_italy ) , [ northeast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northeast_italy ) , [ central ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_italy ) , [ south ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_italy ) , [ insular ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insular_italy ) ) would be [ nuts-1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-level_nuts_of_the_european_union ) as the german states are . 
  your [ regions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regions_of_italy ) are nuts-2 , but if i read it correctly these regions got administrative power , similar to the states . 
   traffic jams and not only on the autobahn . 
  deutsche bahn/trains are affected by this aswell ( c.f. 
  duisburg a40 as a recent example ) . 
   all germans that lived there fled or were expelled you are remembering me to maybe ask my grandfather about it . 
  he fled as a child ( with mother and brother [ dressed as a woman , to not be drafted or something ] ) from east-prussia or west-prussia ( the parts that are now located in poland ) to the rhineland ( lost a brother in the east battle ) .
