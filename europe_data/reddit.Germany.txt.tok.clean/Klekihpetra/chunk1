  the thing is ( i 've seen this a lot recently ) , when you criticize a creatard for his believes , he 's going to be offended and cry his eyes out , because he 's being persecuted and what not . 
  it 's this attitude , that 's giving extremists ground to grow on . 
  i am . 
  but i honestly ca n't imagine that there are n't any non-germans who get that kind of humour . 
  well , i think it 's funny . 
  must be a matter of taste then . 
  the most important component of satire is to hold a mirror up to somebody/something . 
  he does that quite well . 
  constitution = / = foreign powers . 
  any country 's constition probably says , that the state should do everything in it 's power to remain it 's independence . 
  a new study has found out that germans who recently suffered a stroke were suddenly able to pronounce dutch town names and words without fail . 
  oh , i think nigel powers is the embodiment of britishness , while austin is the embodiment of british stereotypes ( you know , bad teeth and so on ... ) . 
  this is awesome though . 
  what about dr. king schulz ( chrisoph waltz ) in django unchained ? 
  he played a german , right ? 
  i had a feeling what it was before i clicked the link and i was n't disappointed ? 
  do you really say `` ahoy '' to greet each other or did n't get this right ? 
   considering germany and austria share basically nothing but the language `` brother '' is definitely the wrong term . 
  what about the  1000 years of shared history ? 
   [ austin powers quotes . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m ), 
   the way you say `` zuper '' rather than `` super '' we do ? 
  [ ave maria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h5rusicenc ), 
   d\u00fcsseldorf - moron 's village you surely meant deppendorf ? 
  on an international level it might have been nena for germany . 
  she was huge in the us with [ 99 luftballons ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la4dcd1auce ) ( thouigh it was the english version methinks ) . 
  [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/stadtbahnwagen_bielefeld_typ_m8d_doppelzug.jpg/1920px-stadtbahnwagen_bielefeld_typ_m8d_doppelzug.jpg ) are our `` old '' ones ( siemens ) . 
  they have been adding the newer [ vamos ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/bielefeld_stadtbahn_vamos.jpg ) . 
  in the long run they want to replace them all with vamos . 
  we also have the [ sparrenexpress ] ( http://partycenter-owl.de/image/userfiles/content/partybahn/slideshow/1-crop-u2328--985--476.jpg ) , which is basically a party tram . 
  kleenex for paper towels/kitchen rolls . 
  haggis is n't too bad either . 
  it 's because they sound funny . 
  usually the president 's wife has patronage over charity stuff ( unesco ... ) . 
  yes . 
  at least if you can believe g\u00f6ran persson , who is also in this thread because he danced with a cow . 
  lol, 
  it 's not like we like you or anything , b-baka !, 
  ** only downside to that is that german speakers ca n't understand it . 
  edit : for reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwbnvkmrpkm, 
  former chancellor gerhard schr\u00f6der once said [ `` hol mir mal ` ne flasche bier , sonst streike ich hier ... '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h4wgcl--ta ) ( get me a bottle of beer or i 'll go on a strike ... ) , which resulted in this [ funny song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo86klwk-ec ) being made by stefan raab . 
  he also ate butter like other people eat a chocolate bar . 
  uk wins / thread, 
  we once went on a class trip to lake garda ( from germany ) . 
  early in the morning , the sun was just rising , our bus was verging on the alps and it was the most amazing thing i had ever seen . 
  most of my classmates were asleep but they missed an awesome sight as the mountains were getting closer and bigger and bigger yet . 
  definitely minnesota . 
  nice people , landscape , wildlife , lakes everywhere . 
  not too crowded but minneapolis/st . 
  paul is alway nearby if you need some city feeling . 
  the heraldic eagle was n't a certain species , actually . 
  just `` eagle '' . 
  i guess it 's associated with the white-tailed eagle because it 's pretty much the biggest european eagle and thus the most impressive/regal . 
  rename trafalgar square to `` place charles-de-gaulle '' . 
  maybe if you ask hungary and czechia nicely ? 
  the should be some sort of text bubbles in the video , regardless of youtube 's subtitle feature . 
  found some scenes with english subtitles but they do n't really catch the sheer absurdity . 
  [ loriot : scary relatives ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-dohz8p6ky ) [ loriot : restaurant scene from ` pappa ante portas ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxlvv6ovobc ) [ loriot : grocery shopping ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-e6rihftw ) [ loriot : training the cleaning lady ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4okyyoh800 ) [ loriot : the old hate of genders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atikmd7imbm ), 
  my favorite is the the [ irish harp ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/common/shared/img/ie/2e.gif ) and the [ italian 2 $ coin ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/common/shared/img/it/2e.gif ), 
  [ chala head chala ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ullm6jcvxuq ), 
  it 's not a castle though . 
  still probably the single most beautiful building in europe . 
  one of the most famous in germany is certainly [ proclamation of the german empire in versailles ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/wernerprokla.jpg/1280px-wernerprokla.jpg ) i would have said d\u00fcrer 's most famous one is his [ self porttrait ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/d%c3%bcrer_-_selbstbildnis_im_pelzrock_-_alte_pinakothek.jpg/800px-d%c3%bcrer_-_selbstbildnis_im_pelzrock_-_alte_pinakothek.jpg ), 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/empress_elisabeth_of_austria%2c_1864.jpg ) was franz joseph 's favorite portrait of sisi iirc . 
  the packages they sell here are ridiculously small . 
  when i 'm visiting my brother in minnesota , i always try to get as many of them 16 oz packs as possible . 
  they are the real deal . 
  what caused me the most trouble were the irregular verbs . 
  we also have some in german . 
  but the english ones just did n't make any sense . 
  it 's not my town but bremen has the bremer stadtmusikanten [ town musicians of bremen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/town_musicians_of_bremen ) . 
  they 're from a fairytale by the brothers grimm . 
  it 's about a donkey , a dog , a cat and a rooster . 
  they are badly treated , so they decide to leave home and become town musicians in bremen . 
  not a sentence but in german we have this word : `` rhabarberbarbarabarbarbarenbartbabierbierbarb\u00e4rbel '' here is the [ story of rhabarberbarbara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycmt395uvwi ) behind it ( in german but still quite amusing ) . 
   while i never watched the movie you definitely should watch it , though . 
  no but they unnecessarily prolonged the conflict , when it could have been shorter . 
   not participing in the 30 years war germany would have liked that as well . 
  after all , what the french and swedes did in the 30 years war was our national catastrophe until ww1 came along . 
   struense the link has an o too much . 
   wernher von braun in physics class we had to make a portfolio , with a cover featuring a famous physicist . 
  i did n't really think about it and only later realised ( when i read up a little more about him ) that he might not have been the best choice, 
  if i had to change the german anthem ( i like it , though ) , i would choose the [ anthem of the gdr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtv92wqyjfa ) . 
  one of the most beautiful anthems ever written . 
  the sinister ( `` alte not gilt es zu zwingen ... '' ) part and the use of the violins give me goosebumps . 
  the text is just absoloutely fantastic . 
  [ something along these lines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_federation_of_planets ), 
  it 's just a phase . 
  they come and go . 
  everyone wants to have the coolest castle . 
  italy 's problem it 's north-south division . 
  the south is infested by mafia , while the north is economically on par with it 's northern neighours . 
  my favorite would be [ adagio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmbvcp480y4 ) by albinoni, 
  i would have said schubert 's [ serenade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpa0l2wb86e ) or [ ave maria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bosoux_d8y ) . 
  also [ moonlight sonata ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tr0otuiquu ) , [ air ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrvdatvuita ) and [ toccata and fugue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9rzjlsyyy ) by bach . 
  [ beethoven 's fifth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv2wjmvpqi8&amp;t=74s ) is also well known . 
  polan !, 
  so polan can into space .
