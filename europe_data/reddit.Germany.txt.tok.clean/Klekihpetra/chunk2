  [ you mean like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is_dt-ff3y0 ), 
  thanks . 
  the one in hamburg looks great . 
  especially with the elbphiharmonie finished now . 
  berlin has these [ three fellers ] ( https://www.berlin.de/binaries/asset/image_assets/3839482/source/1442587705/418x316/ ) . 
  other than that and frankfurt , i 'm not really aware of impressive skyscrapers in germany . 
  i like this picture of [ bielefeld ] ( https://www.bielefeld.jetzt/sites/default/files/styles/huge/public/bilder/news/stadtimpressionen-bielefeld-paetzer03_1.jpg?itok=4klzrwba ) , as seen from the [ sparrenburg ] ( http://www.teutoburgerwald.de/typo3temp/gb/csm_sparrenburg-bielefeld-bielefled-mare_bb5a1b61c3.jpg ) . 
  it shows how green our city really is , since the teutoburg forest runs straight through it . 
  in the center you can see the headquarter of dr. oetker . 
  [ europe ] ( http://www.golden80s.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/europe-rock-band-80s-music.jpg ), 
  i think he has more of a legendary status in these times . 
  [ here 's a list ] ( http://www.runenkunde.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=308&amp;itemid=343 ) with manly germanic names and their meaning in german . 
  the first one is also quite interesting . 
  if only ... 
   hey , i even worked with a german guy with a sense of humour was he from bielefeld ? 
  i 've always liked anton\u00edn ( after dvo\u0159\u00e1k ) , nikita , marek , magnus, 
  [ damn italians ... ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/instances/69203060.jpg ), 
  even antonio banderas ? 
  surely nobody can dislike antonio banderas . 
  for me , tschechei has a bad connotation due to the third reich and when the `` rest-tschechei '' was annexed . 
  also , it 's the same wording as for places like wallachia ( walachei ) , which we would consider to be extremely poor and backwards . 
  i 'm pretty sure we also said tschechoslowakei . 
  i would n't say useless , maybe a little inconvenient . 
  it 's basically the same . 
  you just take the celsius and add 273,15 . 
  if we grew up with this or used it more often , it would n't even bother anyone . 
   triple point of water as 0,01 \u00b0 c ftfy, 
  also : what 's your least favorite ( why ? ) . 
  did you ever see a portrayal of stereotypes ( comedic or serious ? ), 
  that you thought was actually good/fitting ? 
  i do n't think so , tbh . 
  the `` never again '' - attitude is deeply rooted in germany by now . 
  we have something we call `` historische verantwortung '' ( historical responsibility ) towards these countries . 
  also , we would n't just let someone steal our captive markets , 
   the vaalserberg is a hill with a height of 322.7 metres and the highest point in mainland netherlands well , it 's at least high enough to not get swallowed by sea . 
  also , i probably should have written `` mountains '' , so as not to hide my mockery too well . 
   so technically your not wrong . 
  [ best kind of not wrong ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/technically_correct_futurama.gif ) . 
  to be fair , they have mountains in the maastricht region . 
  most turks in germany only know their `` homeland '' from vacation and family visits anyway . 
  they look like they 're about to execute order 66 ... 
  still better than elliot carver though . 
  thanks . 
  so it depends on how the brexit will actually look like ? 
  serious question : will the uk even ratify it ? 
  will it be binding for them once they drop out of the eu ? 
  the one in the op, 
  i once bought a ficus bonsai . 
  knowing nothing of bonsais , i planted it in a nice big pot and thought with thick , black topsoil and thought trimming it now and then would be enough but it just kept growing so i gave up . 
  i was young and dumb but that ficus is still thriving . 
  wow , that 's quite a bunch . 
  those little * larix * flowers are awesome . 
  looks cool . 
  how old is it ? 
  but it 's not ivy . 
  that 's why common names of plants are not to be trusted . 
  nope , it 's [ parthenocissus tricuspidata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parthenocissus_tricuspidata ) . 
  ivy is evergreen . 
  first time hungary was in 1849 . 
  hungary at least twice , gdr and other states od the warsaw pact . 
  let 's give it back to spain then . 
  they know how to deal with rebellious provinces . 
  so , using `` fascist accusations '' in order to to push your fascist agenda is n't the real irony here ? 
  yeah , russia has a history of crushing revolts in other countries . 
  [ it seems the bundesrat needs to give it 's consent , too . 
  so if russia suppresses hungarian revolutions every 107 years , the next time would be due by 2063 . 
  it 's not like nothing really happened at all .
