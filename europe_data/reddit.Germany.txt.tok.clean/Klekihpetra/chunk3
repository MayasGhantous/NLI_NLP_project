  just take a look at the pound . 
  he died in 1804 . 
  it became russian almost 150 years later . 
  i 'm dreaming of better times , when croatia will actually be shown on maps of the eu . 
  be that as it may , it is n't what the premise of u/williampz [ was about ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/58vu9e/walloon_parliament_refuses_ceta/d9418k9/ ) . 
  and i was referring to that premise . 
  thank god . 
  but it should be obvious that he would n't say something like that . 
  did netanyahu really say that ? 
  can someone confirm ? 
  my hebrew is a bit rusty . 
  they have a government and a parliament though . 
  not yet ? 
  jeez , who would have thought europe was this rude . 
  you ask a serious question and get pure spite in return . 
  care to elaborate why my personal experience is wrong then ? 
  scotland = / = england, 
  tell me europe : is the utter admiration for scotland and everything scottish just a german thing or is it common elsewhere ? 
  from my personal experience in germany , scotland is like the single most loved and glorified place on earth , only rivaled by maybe japan . 
   do n't worry famine we ll send food again ftfy, 
   replace english as what ? 
  german should replace english as english . 
  then give it a few hundred years and sufficient influx of french and scandinavian vocabulary and the resemblance will be uncanny . 
  yeah , y' all got ta pick up a dictionary and look up the word `` slightly '' . 
  fact is : the united states only really kicked off [ after ww2 ] ( http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/all630.png ) . 
  [ slightly related ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_paperclip ), 
  in some places you 'd get arrestetd even without the cross . 
  does it include all personnal or only `` real cops '' ? 
  maybe if we promise constantinople to russia , turkey will back off ? 
  last time i checked germany came into existence in 843 ad, 
   which it self was a reaction to the british foreign service threatening to blockade german ports during the second moroccon crisis . 
  was n't this during the second boer war ? 
  yes , that was in 1849 . 
  but it was already clear that they intended to do that . 
  that 's why the people of schleswig revolted in the first place . 
  both times denmark got a new constitution and both times they tried to incorporate schleswig as a province ( akin to the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ) , while prior to that both holstein ( part of the hre ) and schleswig ( not part of the hre ) were duchies in personal union with the danish king . 
  however , it was agreed that those duchies must never be seperated from each other . 
  again , neither belonged to denmark proper . 
  denmark broke that agreement in 1848/1849 , so the london protocol restored the status quo . 
  denmark then broke the london protocol in 1863 . 
  only this time they went too far and not even the other great powers bothered help denmark . 
  plus 1848 and 1864, 
  it 's a pun . 
  `` keiner da '' means something like `` no one there '' or `` no one 's home '' . 
  the bavarian `` koaner da '' sounds `` kanada '' in german . 
  no we do n't . 
  but we were the ones who gave canada it 's name . 
  it 's named after the words it 's bavarian discoverer spoke when he first set foot on canadian beeches . 
  when he noticed that there was no one around he famously said :[ `` is ja koana da !!!, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6war-xuga4 ), 
  well , to quote our beloved iron chancellor otto von bismarck : `` never believe anything in politics until it has been officially denied '' . 
  but are they as drunk ? 
  well done , japan . 
  well done . 
  ah , so that 's the famous wendelstein-7-x . 
  edit : [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stzcuaprrac ), 
  it 's because putin always has that [ cheeky , smug face ] ( https://i.cbc.ca/1.1601461.1379061209!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_460/hi-putin-rtr3cvuk.jpg ) . 
  like he knows something we do n't ... 
  but is n't it also the world 's biggest economy and controls most of the world 's trade ? 
  i see what you did there . 
  babbo natale is gon na be my porn actor name . 
  first map shows that people who were settled in pommerania and lower silesia kept their eastern polish traditions , while map 2 and 3 show the original polish population in prussia . 
  4 and 5 seem to be native to galicia , so a comparison with western ukraine would be nice . 
  6 is probably due to russian influence ? 
   god , germany is well and truly fucked if it 's filled with stupid people like you . 
  people who understand sarcasm ? 
  i think to a great extent his popularity comes from trying to give the eu parliament a bigger role and more say in th eu politics . 
  he 's the one who prys the power away from the established and arrogant council and commission . 
  well , i do agree that the austerity measures have failed to end the crisis but merely slowed it down . 
  i 'm personally all for the full federal state package ( economic , political and fiscal ) . 
  the thing is that this is impossible to do due to the will of merkel 's voter base ( to which i do n't belong ) . 
  her clinentele wants a biedermeier like stability with no changes whatsoever . 
  or as the cdu 's great icon adenauer had put it :[ `` no experimets ! '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/keine_experimente#/media/file:cdu_wahlkampfplakat_-_kaspl019.jpg ) . 
  southern europeans screaming `` nazi nazi '' has n't ecactly helped either . 
  what would have been your solution . 
  push those people into the ocean ? 
  gladly !!!, 
  i reminded people of that in 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 ... 
   and the eu is falling apart and radical nationalist forces have been shot in the mainstream all across europe . 
  things get a little tough and you give up just like that ? 
   and the eu is and has been a disaster for about a decade ( all her leadership ) . 
  economically , socially and in matters of security . 
  eu has seen better time but `` disaster '' is pretty strong . 
  i 'm inclined to think things would be a lot worse without her leadership . 
  the things you listed are partly true but are not her fault and often exaggerated due to selective perception . 
  but what tells you you 're right ? 
   our cuisine is very much shaped by the scarcity of resources . 
  if you 're running low on food ... 
  this coming from the richest people in the world . 
  you got ta let go of the past . 
  please !!, 
  where ? 
  as u/ivdad said , they differentiate between urban and metropolitan area . 
  so rhein and ruhr are a metropolitan area but seperate urban areas . 
  so basically they 're not asking `` is it justified under these circumstances ? '', 
  but `` do you think some people might believe it was justified under these circumstances ? 
  so i guess this is the average wealth ? 
  median would be interesting . 
  and they say history does n't repeat itself !!!,
