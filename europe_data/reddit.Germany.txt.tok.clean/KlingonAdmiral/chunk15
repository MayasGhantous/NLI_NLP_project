  felix austria intensifies, 
  there 's a reason we call her mutti, 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/deutschland_topo.png for example , the cologne-frankfurt high speed line is 219 kilometres long , of which only 42.1 are on natural ground , the rest is on dams ( 51.4 km ) , cut into the terrain ( 72.8 km ) , in tunnels ( 46.7 km over 30 individual tunnels ) or bridges ( 6 kilometres over 18 individual bridges ) . 
  high-speed trains and hills do n't go well together , sadly . 
  watch your mouth , or i 'll have to go all barbarossa on your cities, 
  9 ad best year of my life, 
  well , more like tory leader or \\ #fall 17election, 
  i like scamdalf the orange , personally, 
  article 50 clearly states that talks must be concluded within 2 years of article 50 being triggered . 
  np , mistakes happen, 
   labour hold wigan and gain lagan valley from dup , giving them a total of 21 seats , or 3.23 % of parliament . 
   dup hold lagan valley , giving them a total of 1 seats , or 0.15 % of parliament . 
  more struts = strong and stable, 
  there was lombard italy , basically everything north of rome . 
  it exists as a neutral abttleground so that germany and france must n't not fight wars on their territory . 
  might stuff break then , and breaking stuff is expensive . 
  sadly , the creation of belgium did n't accoutn for this new cool thing called `` total war '' . 
  you gib back eupen-malmedy ? 
  constantinople in 1453 was a glorified village living in the husk of a once grand city . 
  eh , earlier if at all . 
  the byzantine empire in the mid-1400s was a joke a state destined to fall . 
  danubian federation, 
  killing and incesting each other while ignoring the much greater threat beyond their borders ? 
  yup , sounds like got to me . 
  have an army quickly encircled hundreds of kilometres away from the front . 
  england and france had a discussion who of them should control the world , especially the ohio valley . 
  this then became a seven year 's discussion in which the prussian got to show austria who 's boss . 
  but did england a france decide which one of them is boss ? 
  yes , and it 's england !, 
  but england is also now broke . 
  so the began to tax the shit out of america . 
  `` fuck you '' , said america , and declared independence , and fought for it . 
  and france helps them win ... ... now france is broke . 
  then why are the king and queen still wearing such fancy dresses ? 
  i still do n't see why we should pay a single penny more for nato without recompensation . 
  as a german ... just accept the loss and move on, 
  plus the collapse of the great horde just left so much juicy land in what is now the ukraine to gobble up . 
  ger ** many **, 
  1 king in 1500 . 
  the roman-german king , who was also roman emperor in personal union . 
  unleyy you count bohemia as germany ;p, 
   apparently it was in the middle of a prolonged proxy war between various powers , with none really coming out ahead . 
  great game beta 0.1.500 ? 
  bombing libya . 
  because that was such a brilliant idea as it turned out . 
   refuse to do your part of the lifting what will nato give us in return ? 
   refuse to support mutual defence the last time i checked , we were one of the driving forces behind eu military integration . 
  just yesterday we announced to intensify our military cooperation with romania and the czech republic . 
  guess which country staunchly opposes an eu army ? 
  only age can produce wisdom and insight . 
  but even that is no guarantee . 
  on-hand demonstration . 
   i think that holds for every nation 's young college kids who follow similar political ideologies . 
  young , inexperienced and naive minds agreeing with populists ? 
  colour me impressed . 
  and yes , even with 25 and 30 you are still inexperienced and naive . 
  bialowieza was n't part of prussia/germany though , at least not after the congress of vienna . 
  i do n't know where exactly the border was in the area after the third partition , but even if it was within prussia it would 've been on it 's very fringe . 
  because there were barely any germans in the general government and , y' know , the poles could n't really leave ? 
  0.2 % of the population of 12 million were german , thus there were merely 24,000 germans in the territory of the general government . 
  hard to find those targets when there are barely any . 
  plus those targets are more than likely highly guarded in the first place . 
  annnnnnnnnd what happened to the polish underground state once the red army entered poland ? 
  sure poles , go ahead mess up stalin 's political ambitions in central europe . 
  he 'd love that i 'd assume . 
  the ussr sent a message to her sattelites in germany , hungary and czechoslovakia - fall in line or face the consequences . 
  plus the 400,000 deaths during the expulsion did n't come from nowhere . 
   how many poles blew themselves killing children and innocents across germany during ww2 and afterwards ? 
  believe me , if stalin let them they would 've . 
  some israelis actually planned to poison our water supplies shortly after ww2 . 
  killing is just a means of communication, 
  internet spaceships are from there, 
  what 's wrong with estonia ? 
   china the name is derived from their first imperial dynasty , the qin . 
  which is actually pronounced more like `` chin '' . 
  china thus means `` land of the qin '' . 
  what does that have to do with the congress of vienna ... 
  westgermanisches archipel, 
  `` germania '' is acually a quite inaccurate name iirc , the further eat you go the less `` germanics '' and more slavs and balts you would find . 
  `` west germanic archipelago '', 
   bronze age balto-slavic cultures ; looks like the eastern borders as per the congress of vienna are correct then . 
  i 'd sooner have stayed german territory rather than become czech . 
  until potsdam the western allies actually favoured the eastern nei\u00dfe as the estern german-polish border . 
   my favourite food is mediterranean food i for one ca n't really stand mediterranean food , especially italian . 
  cut out those disgusting tomatoes . 
  french food , at least * sane * french food is easily the best of the bunch though, 
  grand prix, 
  i can tell you the reason for that ** paris ** france was simply a ( more or less ) united thing ever since caesar put it under roman control and every ruler , be it a roman governor , king , emperor or elected president will always put the money were the people who could threaten his power sit for france , this was basically always paris meanwhile germany and ( northern ) italy are more densely settled is because they were politically divided . 
  the duke of bavaria built up munich , the duke of saxony dresden , the hansa hamburg and bremen and l\u00fcbeck and so on thats why france looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/france_population_density_40pc.png ) and germany like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#/media/file:pop_density_of_germany.png ) even over at us you can see that historically more consolidated regions ( bavaria and brandenburg ) show a much stronger urban-rural divide than areas which commited * kleinstaaterei * but even france is still tame compared to [ spain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/espdens2.jpg/1920px-espdens2.jpg ), 
   universalist * cosmopolitain * oh by now ancient eu4 versions ... 
  darn \\ #notmyemperor \\ #robespierredidnothingwrong, 
  [ mfw ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/homer_british_museum.jpg ), 
  kingdom republic empire kingdom new kingdom republic empire republic collaborateurs and partisans republic republic france 's last two 1/2 centuries were wild, 
  they quite literally voted the guy out of office once europe was at peace, 
  plus georgia armenia azerbaijan kazakhstan uzbekistan tajikistan kyrgyztan and turkmenistan . 
  russia was huge . 
  the biggest argument against the mythos of `` nazi efficiency '' is the fact that other countries destroyed more people on accident than their willful genocide ever came close to . 
  hey , can we execute farage and johnson and may then ? 
  but why keep humans around in the first place ? 
   unity of purpose this sounds * uncomfortably * fascist .
