  why go across the atlantic when there is a region just as good far closer to the north , which can even be reaced by foot ? 
   you offer south americans citizenship in spain/portugal/france / whoever speaks the language in question , and i am quite confident that you will get as many volunteers as you have open slots . 
  what would i want with them in spain , portgual or *** france *** ? 
  i want them in ** germany ** . 
  people that are n't in germany are n't of use for germany . 
  not enough , until you want to introduce child labour . 
  just expand the industrial base massively . 
  have 2-3 million men and women under arms at all times ( remember , what made germany strong was being an army with a state attached ) . 
  the need of keeping an army this size supplied should create a huge amount of new jobs . 
  for instance we need a new tank manufacturer , our current one is fusioning with a french company . 
  and we have no aerospace company since eads was formed . 
  furthermore , space exploration must be focussed on massively ( totally not testing icbms here ) , the esa is increasingly becoming a cesspit of bureaucracy . 
  a german space program would allow us to get in another cool nations club . 
  germany easily has the capabilities of supporting a space program as well . 
  because getting immigrants is hard , and the politicians just seem not to realize the severity of the situation . 
  of course one could simply look in the people factories of asia , but those are absolutely uneducated most of the time - syria was at least a barely functioning state most of the time - bangladesh and rural india are not . 
  and their vies are probably even more alien to us europeans than syrians are . 
  the optimal place would probably south america , the nations there are rather competent ( when compared to asia and africa at least ) , but tend to be somewhat unstable . 
  especially venezuela could be destabilized within weeks i presume . 
  but the problem is that the people will just go north to you instead of traveling across the atlantic . 
  the middle east is our best bet . 
  escept you want to take a land war in europe , taking other nations people also works ( no guarantee in case of some great power coming to crush you ) . 
  also never underestimate the power of cultural assimilation - you americans should know a thing or two about it . 
  and before you come with the german turks - our government * totally * fucked up integrating them , believing they would return to turkey one day ( lol ) . 
  can you send us your mexican immigrants please ? 
  except that germany will lose about 500,000 workers or so every year for the next 20-30 years due to the rapidly aging society , starting in 2 or 3 years or so when the birth-rich years of the 50s onwards reach pension age . 
  we need new workers to replace the economic power lost , to simply keep our welfare system * running * . 
  the nations of eastern europe face much of the same problem . 
  by current estimates germany will lose 6 million people by 2050 , poland 4m , romania 2m , greece 1.5 m. 
  considering that the averga age will only rise until 2050 , the hit on the actual workforce will be dramatically harder , poland for example might lose 15-20 % of its workforce in the next few decades . 
  the demographic change will most heavily hit east of the rhine , in `` i-have-a-terrible-age-structure '' germany and the rural eastern european states , whereas western europe will grow or at least keep it 's population constant . 
  this will only mean that political power in europe will shift towards london and paris while berlin will be weakened , as the eu was kind of built on the balance of power between uk , france and germany this might become a serious issue for the union in the future . 
  in the meanwhile , eastern european `` ruritania '' will left behind in the dust * even more * . 
  but on the other hand , weeding out all the weak , short-sighted states in europe might not be the worst thing . 
  let this age of small nations come to an end to usher a new era of empires . 
  feels good to be in the great powers club . 
  anyone up for a bit of partition or a little regime change somewhere ? 
  every single atom ( except the hydrogen ) that is part of earth has been forged in the fires of a long extinguished star . 
  technically , the entire planet already is solar-powered . 
  german soldier in 2020 : `` this is my ... 
  broomstick ! '', 
  about to sphere iraq and get acess to it 's sweet oil . 
  if we do n't bolster our population very , very quickly , much faster than births could provice , germany will perish . 
  when there are a mere 60 million germans standing against 80 million vile french , the rhineland will soon bow towards paris . 
  without the rhineland , schleswig-holstein ( to denmark ) and the territories past the elbe ( to poland ) will soon follow . 
  with bavaria leaving the union , germany will be nothing but a desolate ruin of a state . 
  the possibility of such a scenario can not be allowed to happen . 
  once , austria could into eastern europe . 
  now , eastern europe can into austria . 
  what ? 
  we are just an ex who gets close to their former partner to get stuff back they forgot at their place . 
  so , overheating again for the next crash ? 
  the danish party in schleswig-holsteain enjoys exemption from the 5-percent hurdle which almost all other parties ( the only other exemption is the sorbish party in brandenburg , which so far did not run on state-level elections ) . 
  then you were n't taught very well . 
  piast-poland lost silesia in 1335 ( de facto it was lost in the late 13th century already ) , pommerania was only held in the very first incarnation of poland and was lost when the first piast kingdom collapsed in 1034 . 
  they can have the land if they want , but they should please stop calling it `` recovered territory '' - they only hold it because a georgian asshole refused to give territory on the other end back to them . 
  by now , k\u00f6nigsberg is absolutely a russian city sadly , and there is no way russia is gon na give it back , it 's their only warm water port in the baltic . 
  i still want it back , though . 
  [ this speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmhb6d1_aic ) that guy had some balls . 
  time to restore the old border with france . 
  the centuries of general uselessness between the golden bull and 1871 . 
   more victims and we had a bigger hand in it . 
  ouch . 
  go back to asia ya damned immigrants !, 
  is n't there a pretty good chance though that african christians are not catholics ? 
  even sub-saharans happily mix animistic rites into their christian beliefs , and ethiopia is coptic . 
  they ai n't gon na use the churches that we have . 
  in fact , the different christian denominations happily despise each other . 
   central europe 's most important country wat ? 
  please show me were i connected anything to hitler ? 
   start having babies now , and slowly reduce immigration year after year . 
  it 's totally doable . 
  what the fuck ? 
  you 're for doing nothing and supporting this mass invasion . 
  your ancestors must be proud of you . 
  that 's exactly how they envisioned when they left you these great lands built on sweat and blood . 
  built on sweat or blood ? 
  germany has been systematically ruined for the last 200 years . 
  and no , just birthing more children will not do it . 
  the birth rate was high through the 50s and early 60s before ** sharply ** dropping off ( 1967 1,320,000 to 1973 810,000 ) . 
  if we only take the two years with most births ( 1964 and 1965 at about 1,340,000 each ) and assume that about 1,150,000 of those reach pension age , and pension is reached at age 67 , this emans germany will get 1,3 million new pensioners in the years 2031 and 2032 . 
  even if every woman that can give birth suddenly births magical triplets , they would n't hit the job market in 2031 , because they would be 16 at that time . 
  as people just do n't get magical triplets left and right , even if birth would suddenly increase drastically , they would come simply too late to cushion the crash of the welfare system come the 2030s . 
  and this does n't get into the also strong years before 1964 and 1965 . 
  we need a massive stream of workers just to keep our welfare systems running . 
  - about half a million each year until 2030 . 
  otherwise , germany will perish . 
   neighboring `` contaminations '' do n't erase ethnicities . 
  you do realize that when romans invaded britain , their entire genetic contribution on that island through all that time was less than 1 % ? 
  do you realize that the germans marched into the slavic territories past the elbe ? 
  in fact , mecklenburg was ruled by a slavic family until the monarchy was abolished in 1918 !, 
  it is too late for simply births to prevent the collapse of the welfare systems in the next few decades , unless we either lower the entry age of employees to like 15 years , get rid of pensions altogether , or find other ways to bring the age distribution back to a healthy pyramid . 
  also `` replace '' us ? 
  germans have been replaced centuries ago - theres proto-french in franken , slavs with a bit of french past the elbe and poles in the ruhr area . 
  there is a reason why the german nation was defined by language and not by heredity . 
  there 's a legal alcohol limit for pilots that 's not = 0 ? 
  much to late for that . 
  even if we would immediately go back to like 3 children/woman , these would not enter the market early enough to support the explosion of seniors once the baby boomers of the early 60s reach pension age , which is about to happen in the next 10-20 years . 
  [ the thing which scares me more than any `` flood of immigrants '' .
