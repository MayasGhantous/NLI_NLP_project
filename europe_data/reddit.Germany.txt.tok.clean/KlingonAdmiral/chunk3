  yeah , there 's kind of a saying that german scientists fell into 3 groups : 1 . the jewish scientists , that either emigrated or went into the death camps 2 . the anti-nazi scientists that either emigrated or went into the death camps 3 . the nazi scientists that were scooped up by the victorious powers after the war i want my lockdown on the physics and chemistry prizes back . 
  population of austria-hungary, 
  that 's also the reason why germany 's ratio is so comparatively low . 
  before the nazis , we were leading in practically all scientific fields . 
  should probably read `` former colonies though '' , considering how the teutonic knights and the livonian order stood in relation with the hre . 
  lebensraum are newly conquered territories , poland is eastern germany . 
  learn your definitions . 
  sooo ... reddit is kind of like the eu ? 
  dibs on eupen-malmedy !, 
  * in what would soon escalate into the american civil war , the populace of boston , enraged over new tax increases , threw their entire city into the depths of the caspian sea . 
  this event is nowadays known as the boston sea party . 
  for many centuries ( pretty much from after the 30yw until 1918 ) , bohemia-moravia ( what we now call the czech republic ) was actually part of the habsburg domains and ruled from vienna . 
  the borders within the hre were actually pretty open at times , over the centuries bohemia-moravia acquired a significant german population at it 's borders regions ( which then ended very badly ) . 
  fun-fact : pilsner beer is named after the czech city of plzen ( * pilsen * in german ) , and was invented by a bavarian brewer in 1842 because the czech beer at the time sucked and they hired him to brew a better beverage . 
  given the popularity pilsner enjoys nowadays , he sure has suceeded . 
  the missile system was actually operatad by the certain jebedamir kermanivoic . 
  remember , you heard it here first . 
  time for a partition , i say !, 
  `` greater hungary '' refers to the old medieval and early modern kingdom of hungary , which fell under habsburg rule in the early-mid 15th century and then was ruled by them and later their junior branch habsburg-lorraine from 1526 until the demise of the habsburg empire in 1918 . 
  you ca n't just re-ofrm the territory of a kingdom without someeone getting the idea of claiming the throne because his mothers uncle of second degree knew someone at the royal court of vienna , that 's how nonsensical the idea of a `` greater hungary '' is . 
  does he realize that `` greater hungary '' also means being ruled by austrians ? 
  just like my landings in ksp, 
  on top of that , there is also a ancestral issue for `` germans '' . 
  throughout the middle ages , the various german political entities followed a doctrine of germanisation , pushing into traditionally slavic regions past the elbe as the population along the rhine and in bavaria just exploded . 
  as a result , the slavs in the region ( mostly pommeranians on holy roman empire soil , plus prussians and various other baltic slavic ethnicities in the monastic orders up to modern estonia ) , slowly became germanized , and are today germans . 
  by using any other definiton of who is a german ( the definition as per language was actually coined way back in the 19th century in the earliest stages of nationalism ) , it would have either excluded most of the northeastern germans ( including the prussians ) or would have included poles ( and possibly even czechs , but in the romantic early versions of a german states you would have been with us any way ) . 
  i mean , we even tried to germanize you , with varying sucess ( largely a failure , though ) . 
  people must remember that the borders outlined in the first stanza of the deutschlandlied ( neman to meuse , great belt to adige ) where actual ( if somewhat generous ) borders of the main german language area in the 19th century . 
  we 'll join you in the current crisis if you could see that alsace-lorraine is returned to us . 
  the vice chancellor would take over at first , sigmar gabriel * god help us all *, 
   do n't let in so many at a time but we need more immigrants , not fewer . 
  so ... those estonians can into nordic ? 
  that has less to do with area size but with what awesome land india and china are . 
  it 's not , historically the german region has , in some form or another , served as an important `` anchor '' of european politics and exerted huge cultural influence . 
  germany , austria and eastern switzerland form the ancient core of a cultural entity , which over the centuries exerted control over modern hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia and large parts of modern poland ( while historically , poland had often aligned itself towards vienna to combat a common foe , the turks , and was ruled by saxons for some time ) . 
  i 'd argue that the czech republic is central europe , not eastern europe . 
  brussels 1695 , though, 
  belgium shall be worried . 
  because when europe walks backwards , it walks right through belgium . 
  no , aachen is the original germany . 
  yes , through the 18th century and especially after the napoleonic wars ( where the brits gifted the rhineland to prussia , more or less ) a strong rivalry between prussia and austria had arisen . 
  however , that absolutely did not stop the two powers from cooperating , for instance in the holy alliance ( a reactionary , anti-democratic alliance between prussia , austria and russia ) . 
  however , soon after napoleon nationalism turned up ** hard ** in the german confederation . 
  for the first few decades austria and prussia worked kind of together to curb those liberal tendencies ( both were very happy with the status quo ) . 
  then 1848 and it 's march revolution happened . 
  apart from the demand for more political freedom , pan-germanism was a big issue for the revolutionaries . 
  for the german question , there were two solutions : 1 . 
  `` greater germany '' or `` gro\u00dfdeutschland '' . 
  the inpractical , romantic ideal situation for a german state , not only including what would leter become germany , but also the german-speaking parts of the austrian empire . 
  and czech bohemia for some reason . 
  but as austria had no interest in giving up her empire for another empire that it probably had to share with prussia , this proposal soon fell out of favor . 
  basically the german confederation without austria , the far more realistic solution . 
  in 1849 the national assembly actually offered the german crown to the prussian king . 
  but as this entailed things like `` constitutionalism '' , the king turned the offer down and send in his troops to dissolve the national assembly . 
  but even with the revolutionaries defeated , the prussians had realized that the days of the german states was numbered . 
  either they would unify the germans under their banner or one day a revolution would sweep them away . 
  losing no time , the prussians set up the erfurt union in an attempt to unify germany under a prussian-led confederation ( which had a totally awesome [ war flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erfurt_union#/media/file:kriegsflagge_deutsche_union_entwurf_1849.svg ) ) . 
  but under pressure from austria and russia , the prussians soon had to back down . 
  enter bismarck . 
  austria had actually no real desire to from an unified germany , the lands they already held gave them more than enough work . 
  they were totally fine with how the german confederation worked . 
  when the german empire was founded in 1871 , the prussian elite declared the german question answered . 
  for the common populace it was not , though . 
  the austrians were still germans , and all germans should be united under the german flag ( fun fact : the empire did n't fly black-red-gold because austria was still independent ) . 
  which is part of the reason why an austrian could serve in the german army during ww1 , view himself as a german and in the end rule germany ( hitler only became an official german citizen in 1934 , when he already was chancellor ) . 
  austria was a part of the regnum teutonicorum during the dark ages , a political entity that over time kind of dissolved into the holy roman trainwreck of the early modern time . 
  as germany must be considered a legal sucessor of the regnum teutonicorum , berlin should have a pretty damn strong claim on austria . 
  whereas especially the low countries have moved significantly away from germany ( remember that back in the middle ages , pretty much everything between metz and pommerania was german ) , austria is still pretty close to the `` germans '' ( which is a rather stupid term anyway , considering what a funny mix of all kinds of peoples we germans are ) . 
  the fact that austria did n't become a part of a `` greater '' germany in the 19th century was purely political in nature , not because of some cultural divisions . 
  that is also the reason why germany became an empire , as the traditional rank of kingdom would have put berlin below the habsburgs in vienna , which was back then absolutely considered german soil . 
  and austria is germany !, 
  last year they unveiled a statue of the guy who shot archduke franz ferdinand , praising him as a serbian hero . 
  yeah , seriously . 
  useless slacker 3 . 
  wwii was a tragedy for other peoples commited by us . 
  what we got was really just comeuppance . 
  glorious alter fritz potato stronk, 
  without doubt the greatest tragedy in german history . 
  remove stinky catholics !, 
  we 30 year war you !, 
  to their ancestral homelands on the slopes of the urals . 
  also , germany clearly has a rightful claim on old germania . 
  there is no colour difference between land and sea . 
  there is just an illusion created by the rivers . 
  thus areas with few or no rivers , i.e. 
  the curonian spit , are not visible . 
  it 's fractals all the way down . 
  and also all the way up . 
  if the uk leaves , you 'll be alone in here with us .
