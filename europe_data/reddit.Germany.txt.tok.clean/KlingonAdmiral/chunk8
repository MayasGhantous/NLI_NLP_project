  like the true frenchmen they are . 
  you 're right , seems more like the first popped up on the central asian steppes ( although the true origin of the turks is unknown ) . 
  still they might have picked up chinese vocabulary from there - they were subjects of the xiongnu who were a thorn in the side of early china . 
  and the g\u00f6kt\u00fcrks also stretched as far as mongolia , so that thy picked up some chinese seems rather likely . 
  there 's also colombia . 
  he said ` look for a job ' / s, 
  you though germany , france , italy and spain were fasttracking the proposal for a proto-eu-army ? 
  fasten your seatbelts guys , you have n't seen anything yet . 
  are n't the turks originally from like mongolia or so ? 
  three words : german nuclear weapons, 
   cod fish ( bacalhau ) i just realized that `` bacalhau '' is just the portuguese trying to pronounce kabeljau, 
  plus turkish coffee . 
  talleyrand ? 
  talleyrand . 
  if russia attacks eastern europe and gets away with it , i 'd be all for negotiating another partition with them . 
  but ... iran is called persia . 
  `` iran '' is persian for persia . 
  because controlling denmark would have given `` germany '' control over who gets to enter and leave the baltic . 
  which would have quickly led to all the other great powers ganging up on them . 
  having relatively minor denmark ( especially after the loss of norway ) control the entry to the baltic was fine , they could quickly be brought to `` reason '' by the larger powers . 
  but an actual great power in charge ? 
  unacceptable . 
  because bismarck did n't feel like fighting all the other great powers in 1864, 
  ruled by someone who was neither spanish nor austrian, 
  i think you mean the glorious [ quaternion eagle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/quaterionenadler_david_de_negker.jpg ) ? 
  * yo dawg , i hear you like flags ... *, 
  so you are zoroastrians ? 
  starting with germany and france . 
  i wonder if the british will get a collective heart attack if we call the `` totally-no-eu-army '' ** a ** lliance for ju ** x ** taposed ** i ** nterests and ** s ** tability ? 
  [ germany got a new flag a few patches back , and it 's awesome . 
  ] ( http://www.eu4wiki.com/file:germany.png ), 
  actually , even the germans though the vichy government was a bit * too * happy to turn over the jews to them , if i recall correctly . 
  take note that syria much higher infant mortality than western europe ( ~ 15 out of 1000 compared to ~ 3 in western europe ) and is also not the most generous of welfare states . 
  a large number of children is simply how people in most of the world can affford to maybe retire some day . 
  the only solution for that is a final solution . 
  iirc , stalin deported the sizeable german minority in russia past the urals when the war broke out, 
  [ ahahaha ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/molotov_with_ribbentrop.jpg ), 
  but as hungary = austria and austria = germany does that mean poland = germany ? 
  largest territorial state in europe at the time . 
  still a ( grand ) duchy, 
  after ww1 , posen , west prussia and the southern tip of silesia around kattowitz were ceded to poland , alsace-lorraine was returned to france , denmark got northern schleswig and belgium eupen-malmeda . 
  after ww1 , northern east prussia went to russia , while silesia , southern east prussia and silesia ( save for a tiny sliver west of the nei\u00dfe ) were put under what was officially `` administration by poland until a final settlement regarding germany had been reached '' . 
  this settlement came in 1990 and had germany renounce all claims east of the oder-nei\u00dfe line ( although de facto the loss of this territories had been accepted decades earlier ) . 
  `` in god we trust '', 
  people like being in power, 
  typical portugal tactic . 
  ally spain , focus on the colonies and forget about europe . 
  take a look in 1750 and see that austria spans from paris to constantinople . 
  well , only a bit . 
  then the european majors intervened mainly to either support the habsburgs or break their dominance on european politics . 
  constantinople/istanbul was capital of the empire for a longer time then rome was , actually . 
  valiantly the poles rode , down to their eventual doom, 
   poland has violated wilson 's right of nations ' self-determination , tbf , the `` self-determination of nations '' was little more than ww1 anti-german propaganda, 
  ussr , arguably . 
  and mao, 
  masterful planning by us . 
  exhaust the british and french colonial empires by two massive wars in quick sucession , robbing them of their only advantage against us . 
   thank you mongols , `` no i must defeat the mongols '' attila magyar shouted the radio said `` no attila you are the mongols '' and then attila rode on a horse pillaging villages on slovenia, 
  `` i only need a few thousand dead so i can sit at the peace conference as a man who has fought . '', 
  well , you destroyed that trust by keeping rome out of italian hands . 
  until we kept you busy . 
  ww2 started with the marco pole bridge incident on july 7th 1937 . 
  germany builds france 's rifles and france builds germany 's tanks . 
  i mean , if we continue this trend we will soon have the eu army without having the eu army . 
  and once the queen dies , it will be house oldenburg . 
  and yes , for the last ~ 250 years or so the ruling house of the united kingdom has been from germany . 
  they had their chance and fucked it up , so nope, 
  because lineage comes from the father . 
  and maria theresas father had to abandon salic law to have his daughter able to inherit , which led to the war of the austrian sucession . 
  difficult without a mediterranean port, 
  what about san marino ? 
  on the other hand , poland has accepted homosexuality for so long that it has bhecome one of the `` good old values '' any true conservative would protect . 
  which sigismund are you talking about ? 
  there were like a few . 
  sigismund i the old lost , as grand duke of lithuania before he was elected king of poland , about 210,000 km \u00b2 to moscow in the second muscovite-lithuanian war of 1500-1503 . 
  it 's how lithuania 's convex eastern border became the concave frontier that persisted up until the first partition ( which some minor gains and losses here and there ) . 
  i have to disgree you with the tks , they subjugated to poland after converting to protestantism and secularizing , i 'm sure neither pope nor emperor would have been that upset about curbing protestantism . 
  the central problem of poland-lithuania was that it failed to properly break the power of the noblity and centralize the administration . 
  a state like the commonwealth would have been viable in the centuries prior when all of europe ( except maybe italy ) was kinda bad at this whole statescraft thing , but after the 15th century europe quickly became very good at it again , and sooner or later those states that failed to properly reform became unviable and met a quick end . 
  let 's not forget that the hre , which shared much of the same issues as the commonwealth ( and admittedly on an even larger scale ) fell just about a decade after poland . 
  and even without the divisions , i doubt the commonwealth would 've survived napoleon . 
  which is a real shame actually , poland certainly had the size and population and infrastructure to become and remain a respectable power , but they simply squandered the opportunity . 
  and history would 've taken a significantly different turn indeed . 
  the first sigismund immediately lost a good chunk of eastern lithuania to moscow . 
  he also thought it was a good idea to keep the teutonic knights ( now as the duchy of prussia ) around ruled by a member of a foreign dynasty ( which ended badly for them ) and the second sigismund failed in the most important duty of any ruler : produce a heir , which led to this whole elective monarchy debacle . 
  and while stephen bathroy and sigismund vasa were certainly the high-points of the commonwealth , they still barely managed to solidify their internal power against the sejm , and failed at the diplomatic stage . 
  bathory failed to secure the hungarians as lasting allies or at least subjects ( the failure of poland to get any sorts of territorial gians out of the various wars against the turks is nothing but staggering ) , and sigismund vasa created a lasting animosity with sweden which eventually led to the deluge . 
  they did . 
  the grandmaster converted to protestantism and gave hommage to the polish kind , becoming the duchy of prussia under polish suzerainty . 
  this grandmaster was a member of house hohenzollern . 
  about a century later , the duke of prussia died without heir , and the territory went to the margraves of brandenburg . 
  just open a history book . 
  after casimir iv poland and lithuania continously lost land ( both in wars and giving it away ) , failed in domestic and foreign politics , most significantly making themselves the nobilities bitch ( really , you should 've just looked west for a second back then and you would 've seen what a too powerful nobility leads to ) , and by kicking the turks out of eastern europe indirectly dug their own grave . 
  not really . 
  after the end of the jagiellons poland kinda sat around rotting away from the inside as the nobility sucessfully undermined the efforts of the various kings to properly reform the state . 
  then they have one good moment at vienna and suddenly everyone think the commonwealth was this awesome thing of power and influence which it was not . 
  even at the turn of the 18th century , it was more and more becoming a way for russia to story land it did n't 3ant to annex yet . 
  piast poland was swell ( at least before it decided to stop being an unified realm for a bit ) , the commonwealth was n't . 
  good old siebenb\u00fcrgen, 
  all issues with the arabs stem from sykes-picot and thus britain and france .
