the thing is that europe seems to be heading in the same direction the us just did ... 
  that 's what stanley milgram thought too . 
  there are some shops that are open regularly on sunday though . 
  there 's an edeka in osnabr\u00fcck , for example , that is open until 11am every sunday . 
  osnabr\u00fcck ca n't be the only one , right ? 
  i hope you are aware that there is a group of people in any country in the first world that has it * far worse * than lgbtiqa people do nowadays . 
  that group is called * children * . 
  children effectively do n't have rights - they have the rights given to them by their parents . 
  child abuse - especially emotionally abuse , which is the abuse most likely to induce c-ptsd - is very , very common , yet almost never is anything done about it . 
  spend a few decades being someone 's slave and get c-ptsd due to this - have all your trust in humanity completely broken - then we 'll talk about `` insignificant bullshit '' again . 
  sadly , / u/cheekycheetah is n't wrong , we do tend to be very condescending and police others heavily . 
  actually , while germany has pretty generous social benefits for foreigners , their social system is n't all that stellar for their own population ... in fact , they constantly rank `` mediocre '' in oecd studies ... it is simply the german politicians and media who have , in the last several years , constantly painted unemployed people as `` lazy scum '' . 
  never mind that germany has around 7 million people looking for full time employment and only a few hundred thousand job offers . 
  now add to that 1 million migrants arriving last year ... 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9482190/the-punk-prayer-that-landed-pussy-riot-in-court.html but i thought we were all for religious desecration nowadays ? 
  or is it because it was a christian church ? 
  somehow i seem to remember someting mildy traumatic about frozen chicken as well . 
  i mean could n't they criticize the government elsewhere ? 
  why barge into a church and do ... that ? 
  they sang things like `` holy shit '' . 
  i mean ... really ? 
  oh , you monster . 
  actually - pig ( please not the bacon ) . 
  or camel meat . 
  your choice . 
  i mean it 's controversial , but really , there 's good argument for `` abolition '' having been nothing more than bacon-induced wishful thinking anyway . 
  i agree , not funny in the slightest . 
  that bacon suffered to become delicious , delicious bacon . 
  the least they could have done was throw it at someone who would have appreciated it properly . 
  someone like me . 
  edit : oh , they decorated a building with it . 
  never mind then . 
  i mean , i understand the urge to do so completely , but sadly , even bacon goes bad eventually . 
  noooo !, 
  as a german i can not endorse this !, 
  how dare they waste the most sacred and tasty part of a pig like this !, 
  someone could have * eaten * that bacon and it would have been * delicious * . 
  hahaha oh god . 
  seriously ? 
  when was the last time you were here ? 
  this sub is the ultimate eu fan club ... edit : well , mabye not * the ultimate * . 
  but damn , do they make it obvious . 
  no condolences but an invoice ( coroner 's fees ) with threats of debt collection ? 
  that 's just ... low . 
  they did take that one back , but still ... and they excluded the relatives from the funeral service because `` important politicians '' were there !, 
  they 've given up on the country of drugs and window shopping prostitution . 
  good . 
  they are annoying anyway . 
  and next , please stop deliberately setting living animals on fire . 
  thank you . 
  and the greens are n't ? 
  maybe you should research cohn-bendit , and the things he has written in the past , or why some politicians refused to attend when he was given an award for civil courage in 2013 ( theodor-heuss-preis ) . 
  i think you 'd be surprised . 
  being mocked is the only thing the greens are good for . 
  well , at least the greens are n't trying to legalize raping children anymore . 
  that 's something . 
  not that anyones cares ... 
  this shit again . 
  look , we get it , you are so exceptional that you are the only europeans who are n't europeans . 
  german media ( very left-leaning ) were the same , so it 's hardly just them ... 
  `` down the river not across the bridge '' ... 
  whatever . 
  i 'm bi and i 'm still not impressed . 
  the spd is just fishing for votes , once the election is over they will immediately proceed to fuck the poorer people over again . 
  they are no more `` for the people '' than the cdu is . 
  the spd came up with hartz iv - that alone is reason enough not to vote for them . 
  it 's actually easy enough to give these rights to a person of one 's own choosing in germany , so the point is somewhat moot . 
  all it takes is writing up one measly document ( and one visit to the doctor , dated the same day , if one wants it to be 100 % airtight ) . 
  notary not even needed ... 
  the concept of inherited guilt is idiotic . 
  as is collective guilt , come to think of it ... 
  * sigh * sadly true ... 
  pffft sorry but that 's a bit naive . 
  take it from someone who was forced to grow up with severely abusive parents - the rights and wants of adults * always * weigh more than those of children . 
  that 's why this whole `` you ca n't treat children like property ! '', 
  argument is pointless . 
  children are property - at least currently . 
  the majority just have childhoods that are ok enough they are n't forced to openly acknowledge this . 
  lucky people . 
  denial is a wonderful thing ... 
  not creepy . 
  german . 
  quite ironic considering the government has been strictly against raising unemployment benefits by more than 5 $ or so a year , and kept saying doing so would be nothing but a burden on the german state and its economy , and on top of that have essentially been calling people on hartz iv leeches and potential criminals ( with the with the help of the oh so liberal media ) . 
  there 's a * reason * being on unemployed benefits is such a disgrace in germany - because politicans and journalists have been implying for years that they are merely too lazy to work - 200,000 full time jobs , 7,000,000 people on hartz iv/alg 2 and alg1 - and as such deserve very litte . 
  and now it 's all `` hooray !, 
  the money we 're spending on them is helping the economy ! '', 
  it 's like they * want * higher social tensions ... 
  satan worships cats . 
  it 's the one thing he and god agree on . 
  hm , weird . 
  there are way more old people collecting bottles and going through trash than 10 years ago . 
  well , i guess there may be more people just above poverty line but less people below it ... ? 
  [ the things you do for faith ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/german-church-celebrates-star-wars-with-sci-fi-sunday-service ), 
   and pictures of politicians celebrating his death with champagne * what ? 
  * that 's fucking disgusting . 
  honest question : why are people so obsessed with the length of his fingers ? 
  i even saw a fucking `` article '' in a newspaper about this ... 
  no problem . 
  [ here 's something else to cry about ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rita-pal/romanias-dog-shelter-horr_b_5613047.html ) to even the score . 
  ahhh , europe - [ heaven on earth .
