  seriously : allegedly a swiss german term for an agony from which the townsfolk of bern suffered when they went out of their house . 
  or is huis not house but home ? 
  or something like this . 
  my english not good today :p edit : it 's actually true ... in a sense . 
  back at the time when the swiss were mercenaries they were reeeeally homesick . 
  like , even the cows died when they were in france and heard typical swiss alp music . 
  ( this one might be an urban legend of course ... ), 
  7m and my house still stands . 
  on an island though . 
  me too . 
  and yellow bags / bins for packaging material ( almost everything , from cans to plastic ) , a black bin for the rest that does n't fit into the yellow bin ( usually not much ) and a brown bin for compost . 
  edit : and then there 's used paper of course . 
  well , switzerland does not really have a capital city as other countries do . 
  it 's only `` de facto '' because the parliament and other federal authorities are located there . 
  so they call it `` federal city '' . 
  but most people just call it capital nowadays . 
  that 's a good question ... 
  i do n't think i 'm able to name the accents of , say , britain . 
  i recognise the differences though . 
  in school rp is considered the `` best '' pronunciation . 
  when i watch the bbc i like the dialect ( s ) most where the u in , for example , cut is spoken like an u and not an a ( like book , / \u028a / ) , and the a in back as [ a ] . 
  but then again i think this is considered an accent of the lower class ? 
  i live in a so-called [ bremer haus ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bremer_haus ) ... 
  it looks a bit different than those on the pictures though . 
  ... someone took a photo of my house and uploaded it to wikipedia . 
  i live in a listed building , obviously . 
  the nato declared that 9/11 was an attack on the us , and with that they invoked the mutual defence clause . 
  for the first time in its existence , btw ... 
  in germany ? 
  that depends ... 
  i bought one from the police , they have a forced sale of abandoned bikes every two or three months . 
  decent prices and you can be sure that you do n't buy a stolen bike . 
  `` i know how it is , to be poor and stuff '', 
  did you even read the article ? 
  they ca n't even visit the bloody church . 
  what if they are from a christian minority in some bloody muslim country or what-have-you ? 
  also , do you think it 's a good idea to keep those children segregated from other ( swiss ) children ? 
  they are children !, 
  how are they going to integrate that way ? 
  that does not , in any possible way , justify this mistreatement . 
  quite the contrary . 
  you name it : it is the responsibility of the country to decide swiftly . 
  to punish asylum seekers for the lack of a functioning judicial system is just cruel . 
  and i know the swiss judicial system ( and welfare state , for that matter ) - their mills grind very slowly . 
  edit : and yes , i see this as a kind of punishment . 
  i know it should discourage asylum seekers to come to switzerland , and really , i somehow * can * understand that , but - imo it would be more effective if they know that their application is processed swiftly . 
  it would mean faster help for those who need it but at the same time it would discourage abuse . 
  also , at some point in the future i hope that there will be a system in place that spreads asylum seekers on all countries who signed the dublin contract instead of asigning the responsible state as the one that the asylum seeker first entered . 
   are you serious ? 
  these are asylum seekers . 
  this does not in any way imply that there 's anything life threatening for them back in their countries of origin . 
  how naive !, 
  yes , it does . 
  they need asylum , that 's why they are here . 
  asylum law is very clear on the prerequisites for asylum . 
  asylum out of economic reasons is explicitly not one of them , those are immigrants , and with that they can be expelled . 
  i guess you missed the point ... 
  how do you choose the next one ? 
  it just seems so random to me , that 's all  some lakes in switzerland , one in north ireland etc ... but no rivers , for example . 
  why did you leave some lakes visible on the map ? 
  last winter , during some very cold days , homeless people were free to use the public transport in my city . 
  and i do n't know why they should n't . 
  usually , when you 're married , your wife and children are included in german health insurance ... also , the bamf [ has a nice website , specifically made for immigrants ] ( http://www.bamf.de/siteglobals/forms/sprachumschaltung/de/sprachumschaltung_formular.html;jsessionid=4f24a1182961f9d643e40afb8d5bf0f5.1_cid359 ) edit : if you want to change from the polish health insurance to the german public one you have to cancel your old insurance . 
  the polish health insurance has to give you a specific document , which states for example how long you have been covered by insurance . 
  that 's what i had to do when i migrated from switzerland to germany , else they would n't have accepted my application ... 
   high wages , low unemployment , cheap housing , and a good environment to raise a family . 
  good luck on your quest to find that mythical country ... 
  i read twox fairly regularly , and just one or two weeks ago someone posted a link to an article where a woman made some research on that topic . 
  maybe i can find it . 
  ah , [ found it !, 
  ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/07/how-long-can-you-wait-to-have-a-baby/309374/ )  it found that with sex at least twice a week , 82 percent of 35-to-39-year-old women conceive within a year , compared with 86 percent of 27-to-34-year-olds . 
  `` it '' was a fairly new study published in 2004 , she cites at least one other study . 
  no , with the new law , if you ca n't find a slot for a child the community has to pay for a day nanny ( tagesmutter ) . 
  at least that 's what i read , i do n't know if they changed it . 
  but i think that was one of the main reasons/incentives why the communities tried to open more daycare facilities . 
  a day nanny is more expensive than a daycare facility per child . 
  edit : of course you still have to go to court , but you can demand urgent action ( eilantrag ) , or if you have enough money to do it you can give your child to a privately financed daycare and sue the community for damage compensation . 
  because this weeks [ round table ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1j9ntt/series_round_table_week_2_eu_foreign_policy_on/ ) is about israel , i guess ? 
  some stupid racist bullshit about comparing black people to gorillas . 
  i think there is some brigading going on here , two day old accounts with white supremacist bullshit in the comment history and stuff . 
  it 's a bit strange though , given the fact that you get your passport from the government . 
  there are a lot of active hate groups in the us , for example the klu klux klan , the national socialist movement , and the other way around the new black panther party ... the nsm has around 61 chapters in 35 states , for a far-right party i 'd call that quite active . 
  you mean you do n't have anything like an identity card ? 
  nothing ? 
  i , for example , have this one : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_identity_card and [ here is a picture of one ] ( http://www.schweizerpass.admin.ch/pass/de/home/ausweise/identitaetskarte.html ) by the end of 2016 i will be able to choose between 4 different versions : one without any chip , 3 with chip but one only with biometric data ( one photograph , two fingerprints ) , one for e-business ( electronic signature ) , one combining both versions ... my passport already has biometric data on it , and an rfid chip, 
   that was in the 19th century . 
  segregation ended in 1964 . 
  on paper . 
  edit : read your comment history , no need for further discussion . 
   probably because america , unlike europe , is not a profoundly racist society http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/131/351/eb6.jpg, 
  that is simply not true . 
  the last war was the [ sonderbundskrieg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sonderbund_war ) between some catholic and some protestant cantons . 
  it was a civil war , but that does n't really matter . 
  edit : [ according to the british historian niall ferguson , france has participated in 168 major european wars since 387 bce , out of which it won 109 , drawn 10 and lost 49 , making the country the most successful military power in european history ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_france ), 
  achjo , find i au . 
  that just a display of my creativity . 
  question . 
  if i want to become an artist ... could you just tell people `` here is the new `` kuerbel '' , right now it 's just an insiders tip but in a few years , these will be worth a lot '' and then it will be some kind of ... you know , self-fulfilling prophecy ? 
  in swiss high german you only use ss , never the \u00df , while in german high german you use \u00df after a diphthong or `` long '' vowel . 
  wei\u00df has a diphthong - ei .
