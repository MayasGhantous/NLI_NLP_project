  there are more rules , like it has to be an `` unvoiced '' s and no following consonant for all inflexion forms , for example gras - long a , unlike english grass , but gr\u00e4ser ( plural ) has a vocal s. and ... thinks like this are the reason why i want to become an english teacher , not german . 
  edit : it 's not that bad actually . 
  it 's just intimidating when you 're not a native speaker , he . 
  in german it 's `` weissrussland '' ( or `` wei\u00dfrussland '' for that \u00df loving germans ), 
  i ca n't even remember what i put in there , but how about hiding comment scores for 1-2 hours ? 
  i 've seen this in other subreddits and i like the idea behind it . 
  you forgot templars and freemasons ... 
  because [ consociationalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consociationalism ) . 
  people have the feeling that it would n't change much if they vote . 
  in germany , most bigger parties are very competitive , while in switzerland they know that in the end it will be a consencus of all parties involved , respecting the needs of minorities etc ... ( that , of course , is the best case ... ) winning an election does n't really mean that much , because people always have the ability to intercept , e.g. 
  referendum . 
  also , it 's just the most recent parliamentary election , not actually voting . 
  i can vote every 3 months on a lot of different things . 
  who actually is in charge does n't matter as much as in , say , germany , where one or two parties can more or less do what they want . 
  except the bundesverfassungsgericht stops them , which means they wanted to pass a bill that was deemed unconstitutional ... a shame this happens so often , but what you gon na do in oh-so-democratic germany ? 
  that 's how it looks like if you walk out of the hauptbahnhof ( main station ) : http://goo.gl/maps/rvdkv edit : my first impression was ... why would someone build a train station in the middle of nowhere ? 
  it really does n't look like it 's in the middle of berlin , yet it is, 
  i hear them for the first time but i 'll make sure i 'll use them in the future . 
  it most certainly does . 
  norwegians , icelanders , lichtensteiner and swiss are considered eu-citizens , even if they are not a member of the eu http://www.bfm.admin.ch/bfm/en/home/themen/fza_schweiz-eu-efta.html ( english ) edit : switzerland has a bilateral treaty with the eu while iceland , norway and lichtenstein are part of the eea which , i think ( not sure ) , has a similar effect regarding eu-citizen status . 
  anyways , at this point in time it would n't matter much if switzerland joins the eu because almost everything `` interesting '' is already in place . 
  huge list of bilateral agreements : http://www.europa.admin.ch/themen/00500/index.html?lang=en, 
  why does that apply to denmark but not the german equivalent ( baf\u00f6g ) ? 
  as i understand it it is basically the same system ? 
  unfortunately , this sme music-content is not available in germany because gema has not granted the respective music publishing rights . 
  you mean ... get it back , right ? 
  i always found borders funny . 
  especially if people perceive them as something that has `` naturally grown '' over centuries or something . 
  just look at a map from 1000 years ago ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:frankish_empire_481_to_814-en.svg ) , heck even 100 years ago ( prussia !, 
  ) , i mean what the hell ... 
  there 's some imaginary border on a map and suddenly all the people are so different omg , even if they live only 100 meters across the border . 
  sure thing . 
  that 's funny because i was asked if i 'm from the netherlands when i talked to my mother in swiss german . 
  also in berlin . 
  they just do n't know accents . 
  as a swiss , no problem . 
  hmm , i thought if you clearly state on your webpage that you are not responsible for the content of linked pages everything is fine . 
  but i 'm not really sure about it ... 
  after looking at your comment history , all i can say is : stop trolling . 
  you ai n't funny . 
  3 years . 
  nice, 
  i read in a swiss newspaper that if he can reach the swiss embassy he will get a visa for 3 months which allows him to travel to switzerland and apply for asylum ... not sure if that 's the case , just what i read, 
  german invention , too : [ zweikanalton ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zweikanalton ), 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6evhuozuvy that 's a documentary , right ? 
  right ? 
  not with ze merkel . 
  and merkel will win . 
  look at the spd , steinbr\u00fcck . 
  to use the german expression , he 's walking from fettn\u00e4pfchen to fettn\u00e4pfchen . 
  and do n't forget baf\u00f6g , was n't really increased in what , 20 years or something ? 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  especially if you consider the fact that you have to pay 50 % of it back anyways ... 
  only with that smug british accent ... ... and if you look like benedict cumberbatch ... hrr , benedict ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csqq_bc5kiw, 
  yes , but the question is : was a 100 % de-nazification possible without a complete collapse of west germany ? 
  edit : i know it sounds apologetic . 
  especially if you take into consideration that a lot of the really important decision makers ( like eichmann ) got away with it ... same goes for war criminals like mengele . 
  i , too , think `` smaak '' is vastly superior to `` geschmack '' . 
  i do n't even know how to pronounce this one . 
  that 's a tough choice i went with security , fight against organized crime , response to natural desaster or effects of globalization and environment and climate change, 
  also it might seem that most swiss have forgotten our very own [ mass surveillance scandal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secret_files_scandal ), 
  that 's the very essence of awkwardness ... filtrated , destillated , concentrated, 
  but how fast ? 
  in germany you have to pay extra for lte , i do n't think you can just by any contract in any country and expect other provider to deliver lte ? 
  coal made me think of smoke signs ... :-) surely ai n't cheaper than a phone by todays coal prices !, 
  1 ) proof that people can actually receive [ radio waves with their teeth ] ( http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=367925 ) 2 ) charge everyone with a tooth filling 3 ) charge everyone, 
  i do n't want to sound condescending , but you should have paid attention in math class ... 100 million $ would be 1 million for 1 in 100 citizens ... 80 million citizens times 1 million $ is 80 trilliard $ ( 80\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 000 , auf deutsch : 80 billionen . 
  i just pointed out that there is a competitor ( albeit only one , wii is ... something different ) who does n't cut off anyone from buying . 
  also , this thread is n't derailed at all . 
  i stand corrected , then . 
  i 'm sorry for spreading misinformation , was n't intentional . 
  but still , it 's way more restricted than the ps4 . 
  and you can sell used games . 
  not possible with the xbox one ... edit : now while actually thinking about it ... almost nothing speaks for the xbox one as a consumer . 
  only as a developer . 
  no reselling of used games , region locked , the price , always-on kinect , internet necessary for playing ... edit2 : guess i was wrong about reselling . 
  [ read this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1gg400/microsoft_ignores_the_single_market_with/cajx66u ), 
  ps4 is region free ... just sayin . 
  why not just sell the whole enterprise ? 
  would be overpowered or what ? 
  `` please do not vote or comment if you are not a member of this community '' naaaaais , that 's bigotry right there, 
  and he 's still in the psychiatry ... fucking amigo politicians, 
  because conformism is the source of many problems ... inequality being one of them : society tries to push someone into a mold which will most likely not fit , e.g. 
  traditional roles for women ( stay-at-home mother ) . 
  there is also at least one example in the article , those young muslim women who want to wear a headscarf without being patronised . 
  that 's an issue of conformism , not ( only ) feminism . 
  i mean , feminism has achieved much . 
  ( i 'm talking about germany here , because i ca n't say much about other countries except switzerland . ), 
  and that 's great , seriously ... 
  but i think it 's starting to get ridiculous . 
  if my husband and i have children and we get divorced i 'll get them * in almost any case * ... 
  if i 'm applying for almost any job out there ( especially in stem ) my application is prioritized because i am a woman ... and so on ... of course there are still some things society needs to discuss in this regard , for example that men get paid more than women for the same job ( in germany though ! ), 
   the author of that comment probably does n't know the difference between feminism which is about equality , and radical feminism which is about special privileges and crazy . 
  * the article * op posted is about feminism in germany and what can i say , there is ( almost only ) radical feminism left . 
  i know that it might be a completely different situation in , for example , ukraine or some strictly conservative countries or regions . 
  of course what i said does only apply to germany ( and partially to switzerland , although they are a bit more conservative on that matter ) . 
  edit : some employers still prefer men because `` they ca n't get pregnant '' and are `` less likely to drop out and be stay-at-home dads '' ... again , conformism . 
  the employer does n't expect the man to stay at home and care for the children . 
  you ca n't fix this without breaking up fossilized structures ... and for that you need people who are able to think independently ( not egocentric though ... ), 
  what do you expect ?
