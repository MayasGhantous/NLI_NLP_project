  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zopf it 's not sweet . 
  you can eat it with a lot of different things though , sweet marmalade or salty cheese ... 
  it 's also the only bread i can do on my own since it 's rather easy . 
  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/christoph_m%c3%b6rgeli he was the head of the museum of medical history . 
  it belongs to the institute of medical history ... as a professor he was responsible for doctoral research studies in that field . 
  first , the museum is in a really bad condition now and second , he let his doctoral candidates write some very , very , very easy dissertations . 
  like transcribing old texts to high german . 
  he then proceeded to blame everyone for mobbing ( especially coworkers and the new head of the institute ) and he complained to the ombudsman of the public tv station ( which has made a newscast about the dissertations ) . 
  oh and he wants a compensation from the university for being fired . 
  raclette in germany . 
  dudes ... raclette is not putting meat or vegetables of all kinds into a pan and then put some inferior cheese above it ... 
  as someone who grew up poor in switzerland i concur . 
  i live in germany since 5 long years and i 'm not able to vote here . 
  let 's be honest here , it 's one voice against what , 80 millions ? 
  passive vote right is worth next to nothing . 
  active on the other hand ... also , you can apply for double citizenship . 
  that 's what i 'll do . 
  edit : and here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_foreigners_to_vote#germany 2nd edit : there are differences in the german and english wiki article on the subject . 
  in the german one it says that foreigners are able to vote on district and municipality level since the grundgesetz ( basic law ) was changed in 1992 because of the maastricht treaty . 
  hooray for [ flying cars ] ( http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130523-radical-flying-car-model-unveiled ) !, 
  does n't really matter if left or right wing , really . 
  if people are fed up with the current government they start to vote for fringe parties and extremists , just out of protest ... and if you do n't like the right wing extremists , you 're going to vote for those on the left ( most likely a communist party ) . 
  the only thing that makes a difference is that it is easier for a right wing party to appeal to almost everyone ... simply speaking , the left is based on class conflict , which splits the already existing voter base , and the right is based on `` us vs. them '' , them being some kind of minority/foreigners which most likely do n't have the right to vote anyway ... 
  i know it 's kind of obvious but i wanted to mention it . 
  in pre-ww2 some ( of course not a lot ! ), 
  people who voted for the nsdap did that only because they had enough of the weimar republic and could n't identify themselves with the kpd ( communists ) ... still the kpd got almost 12 % of all votes in 1933, 
  i feel kind of assimilated already , yes, 
  * throws feces at frisiandude *, 
  the eu label , yes ... 
  but , for example , [ demeter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demeter_international ) is great . 
  or [ bioland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bioland ), 
  as someone who is interested in psychology i stumbled upon this just a few days ago : http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0272494411000867  in two studies , participants were asked to report on beliefs regarding global warming while seated in a room in which a small tree or several trees had been placed . 
  in one experimental condition , the tree possessed its foliage whereas in the other , the branches were bare . 
  it was found that participants were more likely to believe in global warming in presence of the tree without foliage ( study 1 ) , that this belief increased in presence of three rather than one tree without foliage ( study 2 ) , and that other beliefs not related to global warming were not affected by the experimental conditions . 
  i ca n't stop looking at this and explore where people live on this planet ... 
  check out nunavut ( especially `` resolute '' ) in canada . 
  or sachs harbour . 
  they are fairly inaccurate ... some things are missing , not the most important parts of course but still . 
  do n't forget the potato cartel !, 
  so you mean that the ceo of deutsche bank does n't have to travel that far to his next birthday party sponsored by the kanzler/in ? 
  yeah, 
  because they wanted to say land and ended up with lan , or what ? 
  to me a\u00ec \u011br l\u00e1n sounds a bit like ireland after a game of ... * google * well , this is awkward . 
  obviously the game i wanted to mention is called [ chinese whispers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_whispers ) in english . 
  lol . 
  edit : after a quick search i read that yi-da-li is italy . 
  imagine a chinese saying italy ( yes , the english word ) ... 
  i can imagine it ends up as yi-da-li ... or austria : ao di li and austrialia : ao di li ya, 
  moral-land ? 
  yes . 
  stem ? 
  no wonder you 're lacking basic text comprehension skills,

  what 's the difference between americans and yogurt ? 
  if you leave yogurt alone for 200 years , it will grow a culture . 
  ^ ^ just ^ ^ kidding, 
  ah , yeah , i was there last summer . 
  did n't climb the stairs though . 
  i walked all the way from brandenburg gate to the ernst reuter platz ... quite a distance, 
  ah , well , in september i 'm going to see roger waters the wall in olympiastadium . 
  sadly , i only have one day left to explore the city :( where did you ( ? ), 
  take the last photo though ? 
  dawww , i love little britain . 
  it reminds me of reality shows in german television . 
  well , germany is an accelerant for the crisis in europe , its massive ( subsidized ) exports bleed other countries dry , while in the same time pushing austerity measures on them so that they ca n't afford to build up such a huge low-cost sector and are n't able to compete with this mess ... so no , this is certainly not the best option . 
  was n't quite satisfied with the original title suggested by google translate . 
  ( ... not that it is much better now , i guess , lol ) my opinion : i 'm fed up with merkel , the spd , the fdp , does n't matter which one . 
  the spd introduced hartz 4 ( along with the greens ) and provided a basis for the low-wage sector we see today . 
  the cdu consolidated it and refuses to introduce minimum wages . 
  instead the state subsidizes corporations by paying low-paid ( 400 $ minijob ) workers just enough money to get by . 
  this in turn puts pressure on the corporations that pay a fair wage . 
  oh and afd does n't really seem to be an alternative if you are one of those low-paid workers . 
  they want to increase the wage gap even more . 
  where i live ( north germany ) the highest `` mountain '' is the trash mountain . 
  trash mountain . 
  how can this be a dwarf kingdom with no mountains ? 
  no no , the real dwarves of europe are the swiss . 
  got the mountains , the gold and gems , speak in a language almost no one else understands and high tech is common too . 
  in addition , some of them have very impressive beards . 
  you know that the official national anthem of germany is only the 3rd stanza and not the other ones ? 
  and `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' does n't really mean '' ` ermany , mothafuckas yo '' but was directed against `` kleinstaaterei '' ( territorial fragmentation ) at the time of the vorm\u00e4rz . 
  kleinstaaterei was perceived anti-liberal , feudal even . 
  so this was a very progressive thought at that time . 
  you can compare it to the anthem of europe in its meaning . 
  ( today might be a whole other story since most people do n't know about it 's origin , sadly . ), 
  hmm ... no german ( or swiss or austrian ) university , some of the sites are blank - `` text to follow '' - and some of the courses are already finished . 
  i guess some day it will be a valuable resource ... 
  but it still needs much work . 
  ah , america , where you can show kids pictures of people being killed ( brutally ) but not naked people . 
  i think you 're right ... 
  but then again , you need space for agriculture . 
  also , i do n't know about you but i would n't want to see switzerland stuffed with buildings . 
  i have the impression that it is rather tight for a country that calls itself a melting pot , no ? 
  right now ? 
  japan . 
  that 's why they `` print '' more yen . 
  i meant hyperinflation .
