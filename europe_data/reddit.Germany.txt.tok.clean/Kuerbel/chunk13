  small inflation is happening almost always in a `` healthy '' economy . 
  1-3 % is considered normal if i remember correctly . 
  inflation is the lesser of two evils compared to deflation , which is happening in most economies right now . 
  and besides , japan is a special case . 
  us bonds and yen are heavily intertwined . 
  if the yen goes up , us bond ratings drop . 
  if the yen loses worth , us bond ratings go up . 
  this had nothing to do with the nsdap . 
  in fact , the nsdap profited much more from the deflation-policy of br\u00fcning at the time of the world economic crisis in the 30 's than from the hyperinflation and if you were a bit brighter you would know that deflation comes from austerity which would give you an argument against austerity . 
  of course that 's no reason for inflation by any means . 
  both inflation and deflation are bad for anyone , does n't really matter who .

  http://primove.bombardier.com/en/ it 's not the same manufacturer , but the basic system is the same . 
  inductive charging, 
  i think a lot of these people are afraid . 
  something incomprehensible , threatening has happened and the first wish is that somebody should make it go away , the faster the better . 
  so they have a close look at the news or start `` searching '' in 4chan or wherever . 
  and i guess this longing for vengeance does only partly stem in pity for the victims , the bigger part of it comes from exactly this feeling of helplessness and insufficiency . 
  edit : in addition to this i guess that americans are , by and large , much more extroverted than us europeans ( southern countries included ) . 
  in economic terms they are individualistic ( focused on self-reliance etc ) but their extraversion forces conformity and groupthink . 
  focusing on the outside rather than the inside is what is causing that dilemma in the first place : you feel threatened if `` your group '' - here , the country - is threatened . 
  but then again , studies show that europeans are as conformist as americans . 
  hmmm ...

  yes ... if you adopt a child who has been through a really , really rough time you can be the best parent ever , with one phd in education and one in psychology and * still * the child will most likely have issues for the rest of his life . 
  do you refer to [ jus sanguinis ? 
  problem is , spiegel is owned by bertelsmann . 
  there is a rather short article about the bertelsmann foundation on the english wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bertelsmann_foundation ) , the german one has a lot more sources and it 's paragraph on criticism is far longer . 
  * human thought process, 
  yeah , pronounce it . 
  thank you :3, 
  how do you spell it ? 
  the problem is that as a self-employed person with only a small business ( say , you have no other employee at all or maybe one part time , e.g. 
  as an innkeeper ) you pay for unemployment insurance but you wo n't get it . 
  instead you 'll get welfare , which you 'll have to pay back eventually . 
  oh and you have to wait 3 years for disability benefits . 
  of course you get retrospective payment for that time but in case you were in need of welfare they will take it . 
  and yeah , i think cases like this need to be addressed . 
   freedom of expression always is the freedom of expression of the one thinking differently . 
  that 's not what goold ol' rosa luxemburg said well , at least it had nothing to do with expression . 
  just freedom . 
   common language is indeed an aid in communication . 
  but i 'd take your point further : in my opinion language is also means of thinking . 
  that 's called the sapir-worf-hypothesis or better , [ linguistic relativity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_relativity ), 
  low german is plattdeutsch , right ? 
  i wanted to learn it for quite some time . 
  i live in northern germany and i really miss to speak dialect , and nobody would understand swiss german anyways . 
  hence platt . 
  i guess that at least some people might be able to understand it . 
  and after all , we 're only ordinary men, 
  i have to admit that i feel some schadenfreude . 
  just a tiny little bit . 
  darn , you beat me by a minute . 
  after a bit of searching i found this article http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/world/europe/19germany.html?_r=0 but it only mentions women once :  unemployment in the former east germany remains double what it is in the west , and in some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30 percent . 
  and there 's another [ article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/world/europe/06iht-letter.html?pagewanted=all ) about east german women . 
  i seriously do n't think so . 
  first thing i thought was `` phew ... now that 's [ uncanny ] ( http://www.donnie-darko.de/donnie-darko/fan-art/fan-art_02.jpg ) '', 
  '' ... would be `` an important sign of integration '' . '', 
  catholics who live in a protestant bundesland do n't get their specific days off , for example . 
  also the other way around . 
  or not ? 
  i 'm not sure but i think it is like that . 
  i know i have to work on 1.11 ( all hallows ) which is a specifically catholic holiday . 
  freistaat * after all * free state, 
  :p i bet it 's just a matter of time until the svp starts to demand lebensraum ... just kidding ... [ or maybe not . 
  that was the case in almost every country . 
  my husband , for example , told me that in * some * restaurants etc the owner just changed dm to $ on the menu . 
  so 1 dm = 1 $ while 1 $ was worth 2 dm back then . 
  ha , i remember that post ( about the rather poor latino family who were the only ones who helped some american with a flat tire on the highway ? ), 
  also , i really do n't know how to implement this . 
  i first would have to explain this to the barrista and then someone has to ask for it later . 
  maybe if the coffee shop owner decides to promote something like that ? 
  so what you 're saying is that you are posting bullshit translated with google translator or something like that to make it look like you speak a lot of different languages if people are going to downvote your comment history , because you 're going to post anti-eu-stuff ? 
  and that english are to stupid to see through that ? 
   wars can be fought on the ground in the trenches and through the air with fighter planes but this occupation has taken on the color of money !, 
  here too ( north-west germany ) . 
  in fact , i already started to plant some flowers for my balcony . 
  got to feed the bees in spring , 
  u wot m8, 
   and those in the north do n't contribute much of value yes . 
  labskaus is just gross ... 
  that 's bullshit . 
  even more interesting would be how much you have to pay for the same speed . 
  i have to pay around 45 $ for 16k dsl ( with some bullshit entertainment package - bullshit because i 'd have to buy or rent the only decoder able to decode the signal from the provider , and that 's a shitty , low cost device sold for , like , 200 $ ) 45 $ includes a telephone flat rate to switzerland ( about 5 $ ) . 
  i do n't trust that shitty provider because in the contracts for the better connections ( like vdsl ) it says that they could throttle the speed when i download too much ( like 200 or 400gb ) , ridiculous in times of completely legal 1080p films on youtube , steam , etc fucking telekom, 
   vote differently next ballot is in september . 
  it wo n't change anything , what do you expect ? 
  complete turnaround in foreign / money politics if the leftist parties are going to win ? 
  die gr\u00fcnen ( the green party ) is just another middle-class party with a bit of left and ecology in it but they get most of their votes from the middle-class , and the spd ( social democrats ) has lost a lot of it 's lower-class basis when they introduced agenda 2010 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ), 
  i just know ( read that in a spiegel article ) that it is already forbidden to use it on crop/corn in germany . 
  i do n't know if i remember correctly , but i think in general the more restrictive law applies ( be it eu or national law ) . 
  germany subsidizes low income workers heavily . 
  there are a lot of people who work full time but do n't earn enough to make a living , so they get money from the government . 
  also , they do n't turn up in unemployment statistics , just like anyone who is in a so called work-creation program or further vocational training ( most likely some useless course ) do n't trust these numbers , especially if they come from the german government . 
  merkel sure knows how to avoid bad publicity ... 
   also expropriating only foreigners would be discrimination and ruled null and void before the european court of justice , if not earlier . 
  not foreigners , just the rich . 
   you do realize that 6.75 % / 9.9 % is a bargain compared to an almost complete loss , do n't you ? 
  because that would be the alternative if the cypriot banking system were to collapse . 
  yeah , i realize that , but many people wo n't .
