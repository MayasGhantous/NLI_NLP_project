  i read a lot of news and so do you , but many people do n't . 
  they will only read the headlines on some shitty newspaper saying `` eu expropriating cyprus '' or some other ridiculous claims and then they will run to the next bank and withdraw their money . 
  also , to hit the oligarchs and not the more or less poor cypriots they could have limited the tax to accounts above 100000 $ ... 
   people with less than 100,000 euros in cypriot bank accounts will have to pay a one-time tax of 6.75 % , while those with more will have to pay 9.9 % . 
  it is expected to raise 5.8 bn euros in additional revenue . 
  yeah , sure . 
  in socialism , the people expropriate the high finance , in capitalism , the high finance expropriates the people and now what ? 
  people in italy , spain , france and anywhere else are going to withdraw their money ... splendid . 
  http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/convention/text.htm  in the present convention , genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such  ( e ) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . 
  edit : in switzerland , we have the yeniche people ( vagabonds ) . 
  between 1926 ( ? ), 
  and 1972 there was a charity organisation ( called pro juventute , still in existence ) who tried to take away their children . 
  they took 600 of them and ripped families apart . 
  they put them into psychiatric clinics , children 's homes and foster families . 
  yes . 
  just have a look here : http://www.natrue.org/our-label/ingredients-processes/ there are other certificates , but i think most of them have similar requirements . 
  what i read is that the taepodong-2 is build as an expendable launch system , which means that this thing is build to reach the orbit with a satellite on it and not as an intercontinental ballistic missile . 
  of course they could attach an atomic warhead on a taepodong-2 , but it is n't optimized to do that . 
  and , for a quick read , there is always wikipedia . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction what worries me the most is that they have massive amounts of biological and chemical weapons . 
  if there is a war , i 'm actually not scared of their unreliable missiles , but they certainly have some * reliable * things up their sleeve , like mustard gas . 
  there is interlingua as an alternative to esperanto ... to cite wikipedia :  interlingua 's greatest advantage is that it is the most widely understood international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic ( as opposed to schematic ) grammar and vocabulary , allowing those familiar with a romance language , and educated speakers of english , to read and understand it without prior study . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interlingua and i think it would be a good start to introduce it as an official language in the eu , maybe start some learning programs ... and seriously , i speak 2 languages fluently ( german and english ) , i 'm able to have a basic conversation in both french and spanish but i would n't mind learning esperanto or interlingua since it only takes one to two years . 
  $ `` the institute of cybernetic pedagogy at paderborn ( germany ) has compared the length of study time it takes natively french-speaking high-school students to obtain comparable ` standard ' levels in esperanto , english , german , and italian . 
  [ 33 ] the results were : 2000 hours studying german = 1500 hours studying english = 1000 hours studying italian ( or any other romance language ) = 150 hours studying esperanto . '', 
  brb learning esperanto, 
  and i have never seen an ape give birth to a human !, 
   would be a constructed language esperanto was the first thing that came to my mind . 
  ^ ^ actually ^ ^ it ^ ^ was ^ ^ quenya ^ ^ and ^ ^ sindarin . 
  esperanto helps with learning another `` real '' language too . 
  yes , because ... that was an example of ... well , how easily you mispronounce something that sounds vaguely similar . 
  of course . 
   24 % of the e.u. 
  population does not accept darwin 's evolutionary theory why ? 
  why ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  well , that would solve the problem with the nearly exterminated african elephants . 
  we just train them to it humans and goodbye overpopulation . 
  i. . . is he serious ? 
  wtf . 
  i would n't consider switzerland `` ethnically homogeneous '' even . 
  4 different cultures and languages and at least two major christian religions ( catholic and protestant ) in one state is n't homogeneous . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_people  although the swiss confederation , the modern state of switzerland , originated in 1848 , the period of romantic nationalism , it is not a nation-state , and the swiss are not usually considered to form a single ethnic group , but a confederacy ( eidgenossenschaft ) or willensnation ( `` nation of will '' , `` nation by choice '' , that is , a consociational state ) , a term coined in conscious contrast to `` nation '' in the conventionally linguistic or ethnic sense of the term . 
  i lived in a rather small town in switzerland with a lot of farmers around . 
  no shortage of fresh eggs there ... 
  when i lived in bern i just went to the wochenmarkt ( farmers market , kind of ) and told the vendor i need some really fresh eggs , which he delivered the next time he was there . 
  i think that 2 to 3 day old eggs are fine too , but after that i would n't eat them raw . 
  for fresh mayonnaise or tiramisu i only use the freshest eggs available , so i rarely have to put them in the fridge . 
  the natural safety `` coating '' mentioned in the article loses it 's effectivity after a few weeks , after that you should put them in the fridge and make sure that they are cooked thoroughly . 
  still no sun here ( north-west germany ) . 
  just clouds . 
  clouds everywhere . 
  ikea found horse meat in their meatballs ( k\u00f6tbullar ? ), 
  well , for that price ... at least they found some meat !, 
  just kidding . 
  ^ ^ ^ maybe, 
  most firm or half-firm ( sp ? ), 
  cheese do n't contain lactose ( because it turns to lactic acid during the aging process , as far as i know ) . 
  like , gruyere , emmentaler , or parmesan , or ... well , almost all firm cheese . 
  just stay away from soft cheese like ricotta , mozzarella and so on . 
  keynesian economics has n't failed because it was never introduced in the first place . 
  what was introduced was the neoclassical synthesis , not true keynesianism . 
  adolf hitler was ... ... someone who destroyed an awesome mustache for eternity . 
  :( i 'm not a racist , but ... 
  ... i 'm neutral , yes . 
  which means i sell weapons to everyone . 
  how can this be racist ? 
  what does the skin colour tell us about a person ? 
  oh boy , with that skin color , you totally should n't wear a pink mini . 
  do you have an immediate reaction to the word `` islam '' ? 
  how does it make you feel ? 
  i think we should cut off those damn church towers too . 
  or at least take down the bells . 
  quiet sundays fuck yeah !, 
  you mean after tasty gammelfleisch ( bad meat ) , berlin d\u00f6ner , ehec sprouts , mislabeled organic eggs ... ? 
  the premier chancellor prime minister martin schulz , head , director and chief of the european parliament just kidding ... although ... nah , just kidding . 
  uff , i do n't know how to respond , sorry . 
  i 'm from the german speaking part too , and i do n't know any romands ( french-speaking swiss ) ... 
  but yes , there are some cultural differences . 
  i think the romands are more open-minded . 
  there is also a thing called `` r\u00f6stigraben '' which marks the `` border '' . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%b6stigraben or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_switzerland if you like to read on . 
  well , there are a lot of prejudices and whatnot . 
  ( and i 'm fully aware that i can only speak in generalizations here ) . 
  for example , most swiss think that most germans see switzerland as the little brother of germany or that they idealize it , like some sort of `` paradise '' . 
  or that germans behave snobbish . 
  just things like that , nothing too serious . 
  there are a lot of german immigrants in switzerland . 
  and , i do n't really know how to explain , but swiss german ( our dialect ) is a bit `` softer '' and more melodic and if someone talks to you in high german it just sounds ... 
  i do n't know . 
  harsh . 
  aggressive . 
  and in fact i think ( north ) germans are really straightforward while swiss are just ... polite . 
  always . 
  it 's like `` i really do n't think this is right , but maybe that 's only me . 
  would n't you like to think about it for a second ? 
  please ? '', 
  vs `` that 's wrong , go and fix that '', 
  switzerland ? 
  i think they are a bit like `` continental british '' , the humor is very dry , understatement is a common thing ( most likely a swiss will buy a moderately expensive car with all extras available instead of a bmw limousine ) , usually they are very polite ( not friendly , polite - there is a difference ) , they do n't trust any surrounding country ( especially not the germans ) , and they see themselves as an `` island in the middle of europe '' .
