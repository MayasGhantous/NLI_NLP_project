  for example peoples initiative . 
  for a long , long time this was not actually used to enact a new law , since most of them were turned down at the ballot . 
  no , it was a means to start a debate in the parliaments , trigger reforms , find a way to * respect * the minorities wishes and balance it with the wishes of the majority . 
  now , what does a foreigner see ? 
  possibly : * great , finally a way to show these dumb politicians what the people really wants * or just another way to suppress minorities . 
  and it was exactly the opposite , until the rise of the peoples party and their seriously destructive behaviour . 
  mind you , not because they are right-wingers , but because they shit on the way politics was done in switzerland for over a century , with terrible consequences for the society in switzerland . 
  edit : what the fuck . 
  there is no `` best country '' . 
  every country has it 's problems . 
  [ mass surveillance rivaling the stasi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secret_files_scandal ) for example . 
  you have no idea about the intricacies of the swiss political system and how it works . 
  no way !, 
  do you suggest that europeans are n't allowed to be * everywhere * they damn well want to be ? 
  b-b-b-ut muh education , muh skillz , muh 1st world heritage, 
   i once tried to post facts on a thread like this and got downvoted to oblivion . 
  i do n't see the point of arguing with idiots like / u/ramblinrambo [ 1 ] [ -18 ] anymore . 
  sad thing is , this is what they want . 
  if it seems like their opinion is the only one they `` win '' ( in their minds at least ) . 
  but i 'm running out of steam too , especially since this is only a subreddit out of thousands , it 's sad but not worth it . 
   op is a redditor since this afternoon yeah , that 's common for posts/articles about immigration . 
  sometimes , they are never to be seen again , sometimes , they fill their thread with usual anti-immigration rhetorics and if they have amassed enough downvotes or are shadowbanned they make a new account . 
  i 'm serious , it 's a pattern . 
  / u/mcctaggart mentioned asylum seekers specifically . 
  ops article is about boat migrants , not necessarily illegal immigrants . 
  although [ here ] ( http://immigration.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceid=005235 ) is another statistic . 
  estimate for illegal immigrants in italy in 2011 was 1.10 % of total population . 
  in numbers : 651,000 . 
  ( source is istat ) . 
  heh , i know , i 've been here for a long time . 
  it 's especially funny if you post facts or statistics that refute all those immigrant myths , you know the deal - 90 % illegal and so on , and then either it 's denial ( `` nooo , the facts are obviously * wrong * ! '' ), 
  or you do n't get an answer . 
  or simply downvotes because these xenophobe fuckers know they would lose every argument . 
  do n't know why you got downvoted so much , i suspect brigading . 
  oh no we are all going to die because of 1800 illegal immigrants . 
  how terrible . 
  meanwhile , [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population ) is a list of refugees by country of origin ( second list ) , with an overwhelming majority from countries deemed as warzones , e.g. 
  afghanistan , syria , iraq etc. 
  and with the notable exception of germany , not a single european country is in the top 10 of refugee populations . 
  the us and germany are the only 1st world countries in the top 10 . 
  even if you sort by `` natives per refugee '' , countries like jordan , lebanon , syria and fucking chad have more refugees per natives than the first european country in this list , montenegro ( which is poor as fuck ) . 
  so much for the mythical refugee who passes through so many safe countries yet wants to come to holy europe . 
  most of them * obviously * do n't . 
  [ original source ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/map-of-the-percentage-of-people-speaking-english-in-the-eu-by-country/ ) , and [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf ) is the report it 's based on, 
  but it 's  95 % , makes the rest `` less than 5 % '' . 
  well she can speak german , just not very well . 
  that 's what i gathered from the article ( `` but my grandmother does n't speak german well '' ) . 
  if this means a2 ( more likely than b1 ) level it would be enough for basic tasks . 
  that was a different era . 
  no integration courses , expensive language courses , no acceptance in society for decades , and well try to learn a new language after spending 8 hours or more at work . 
  i do n't know about you but i 'm exhausted after that . 
  plus , in this case , children at home . 
  they seem to be pretty well integrated however and nowadays , there 's no excuse for not speaking the local language if the government provides integration and language courses , yes . 
  it would n't hurt to cut her some slack . 
  especially since most people who make that remarks most likely do n't know how much time she has spent in germany up to now . 
  great answer . 
  where was it the peoples fault ? 
  do you think it was the fault of the american people that the great depression happened or any other peoples fault that it spread all over the world ? 
  also , if the anglo-saxon model is such a great thing why the new deal then ? 
  it helped to catapult the us out of recession , and that 's what is needed in europe too . 
  a european new deal . 
  thanks , that was pretty interesting . 
  found [ this ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/rsi/#?vis=economy ) website , simple comparison between pps per inhabitant . 
  from 2011 though . 
  i 'd like to have a source on that . 
  what was measured and how ? 
  `` stupid countries '' ? 
  it 's always a good idea to just insult someone for the sake of it . 
  they were n't and are n't stupid , if banker decide to gamble against you you * will * lose , no matter what . 
  most of these jobs are `` domestic '' anyway , like service or cleaning or harvesting or packaging ... actual manufacturing jobs mostly are tied to collective agreement ( tarifgebunden ) , labour leasing undermining those agreements is a whole other problem though . 
  edit : some firms just cry with no apparent reason . 
  bmw made fantastic profit yet wants to cut down on work breaks ... 
  whatever `` viable '' means , if employers feel threatened by 8 $ 50 minimum wage ( which is pretty low ) i do n't think it 's viable . 
  this is n't even enough to get more than the basic security pension if you 've worked for 45 years , 40 hours a week ... 
  three year window and i 'm sure the swiss government will wait as long as possible because they know about the consequences . 
  also they still have some scope for discretion . 
  they could set the quotas so high it would be impossible to reach them , like 2 millions or something . 
  but the svp ( peoples party ) already stated they will launch another vote if that happens . 
  you do n't even have to prove you have enough money . 
  it 's just that your stay is n't legitimate , but the state has to prove first that it is n't . 
  the burden of proof lies with the state . 
  at the end of the day it 's too much of a hassle to prove it if you do n't need social security ( since you can just say that you distrust banks and stuff all your money in your mattress or something like that ... as long as you do n't use social security / welfare benefits , they ca n't proof otherwise ) . 
  and do n't let misinformed people at the immigration office tell you otherwise !, 
  you do n't need a residence permit at all . 
  not she . 
  i meant this answer : be careful ms. merkel . 
  if you do n't see the suffering that has been imposed on the rest of the european people , then germany will make itself hated . 
  will ? 
  it already seems to be the case . 
  i hear those anti-german sentiments quite often . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm aware of the negative effects german policies have on other nations , but i mean statements like `` the germans hide in the eu , other european nations only tolerate them '', 
  a masters degree from a german university is certainly a good idea if you want to live in germany . 
  hum ... maybe as a teacher ? 
  though you 'd have to do a master of education . 
  and history/german is the most common combination . 
  you usually study two topics to become a teacher here , of course math/physics/chemistry / computer sciences are the rarest ... english teacher are quite rare as well , and i guess you 'd have a native speaker bonus . 
  french teachers are n't really common either . 
  if that 's not your thing , maybe as a translator if your german is good enough . 
  but english < -  german translators are n't really rare either ... what else ? 
  i do n't know .
