  so i guess every refugee who has a green card is no longer included in that statistic . 
  and naturalized people as well of course , but i do n't know how long that takes ... 
  yeah right now but my graph is from 2012 , as i said . 
  it 's not off , it 's just a bit dated , but the unhcr has no newer data in its database too ... except for the countries which border war zones, 
  i can only speak for 2012 since the unhcr database has no newer data , but there were about 113000 refugees from kosovo and serbia , 90 ' 000 from turkey , 40 ' 000 from russia , vietnam and ukraine ~ 20 ' 000 , the rest is much lower than 20 ' 000 . 
  i ca n't link directly to germanys page , but [ here ] ( http://popstats.unhcr.org/psq_poc.aspx ) is the unhcr database, 
   are in fact not refugees that 's something only a state can decide . 
  you do know the difference between asylum seekers and refugees , do n't you ? 
  it 's from 2012 . http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122 scroll down to `` registered syrian refugees by date '' , you can see that the numbers are accurate for january 2013 ( at least for syrian refugees , so everyone else is not included ), 
   uh ... pakistan is in south asia , not the middle east , last time i checked :d seriously ... lost in translation ( two ways , i guess ) . 
  on the one hand , the german `` mittlerer osten '' is [ this ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:mittlerer_osten_karte.png ) , on the other hand , middle east is the correct translation for `` naher osten '' ( near east literally ) . 
  english middle east seems to exclude pakistan , german includes india . 
  edit : oh , wikipedia says it was once the same for english and german :  before the first world war , `` near east '' was used in english to refer to the balkans and the ottoman empire , while `` middle east '' referred to iran , the caucasus , afghanistan , central asia , and turkestan . 
  in contrast , `` far east '' referred to the countries of east asia ( e.g. 
  china , japan , formosa , korea , hong kong , etc. ), 
  anyways , if you say pakistan most germans think of it as the middle east . 
  um , in bremen you have the `` biblischer geschichtsunterricht '' ( biblical history lessons ? ), 
  in primary school . 
  then followed by the usual religious lessons , then at 10th grade + religion but with a focus on all religions though they want to abolish all of that and replace it with interdenominational * religious lessons from first grade on . 
  most people do n't know that because of bremen the state is in charge of religious education . 
  some states however decided to give back that privilege to religious institutions . 
  ( it 's called the `` bremer klausel '' ) * \u00fcberkonfessionell . 
  https://data.unhcr.org/southsudan/country.php?id=251 yeah , you 're right . 
  strange . 
  i 'd have thought most of them come from the car because of the civil war there . 
  global world poverty line set by the who is 1 $ a day . 
  let 's say it this way , the richest 10 % of all people own 85 % of all assets . 
  worldwide . 
  45k $ is enough to belong to those 10 % . 
  first country they set foot in , perhaps . 
  central african republic goes down the drain right now . 
  ( right now means since 2012 , i guess the numbers are even higher now ) edit : south sudan is directly to the east of the car , so i guess they are fleeing from the war there, 
  source : http://images.zeit.de/politik/2013-10/f_fluechtlinge-weltweit-b.jpg used this image as a template and just translated it . 
  source of numbers is the unhcr, 
  that 's why it is relative poverty . 
  think of it this way . 
  in the foreseeable future you will earn more money than that , right ? 
  now imagine you earn only ~ 1000 $ a month working fulltime . 
  you 'll never be able to buy a house or a new car , allright , those are luxury problems . 
  but your pension will be really low and you have a hard time to save some money for private retirement provision too . 
  and even with kindergeld ( child money ) you 'll have a hard time starting a family on 1000 $ / month , even if your partner earns the same amount . 
  what if they have an accident or lose their job ? 
  there 's little scope left . 
  edit : 1000 $ / month is great as a student . 
  you live in a flat share , cheap mensa/cafeteria food , `` semesterticket '' , lots of discounts ... except for flat share not available as a worker, 
  http://mediendienst-integration.de/fileadmin/_migrated/rte/rtemagicc_asyl_europa_zahlen_2012.pdf.jpg asylum applications in 2012 per 1000 inhabitants . 
  it 's in german though . 
  from top to bottom : portugal , spain , estonia , czech republic , latvia , romania , slovakia , slovenia , bulgaria , hungary , ireland , lithuania , italy , poland , iceland , gb , fins , greece , france , germany , denmark , cyprus , norway , austria , belgium , switzerland , luxembourg , sweden , malta it shows two things : a ) the number of applicants per 1000 inhabitants is pretty low . 
  it was 300 ' 000 people in total in one year . 
  500m people live in the eu . 
  b ) that the states bordering the meditteranean do not , in any way , have more applicants than the northern states it gets even better if you have a closer look at where most refugees come from actually, 
   in this case hope you 're right ... 
  i guess the numbers are correct because these are the numbers from the german statistics office . 
  since germany does everything to lower the official amount of unemployed people ( 1 - $ jobs and so on ) i do n't believe they would let them publish such high numbers about a delicate matter like this if they were n't correct, 
  measuring poverty is a hard thing to do . 
  there 's absolute and relative poverty , relative poverty means you earn less than 60 % of the national median equivalised income . 
  absolute usually means you lack certain things like proper education ( reading ) , proper shelter , food , clothing and so on . 
  obviously 980 $ per month does n't necessarily mean absolute poverty , especially not in germany , but you are at least in a precarious situation ( `` prekariat '' ) edit : a word, 
  backpedaling on social institutions like gay marriage , less protection for employees , less welfare state , and by that i mean american like conditions , no more anti-discrimination laws ( and i 'm not only talking about women , basically everyone who is not white and male and healthy , e.g. 
  disabled people ) , and at least that von storch woman wants to prohibit abortion and sex ed at schools . 
  there 's probably more . 
  i know that lucke says some nice things , but i guess most of this is pretty much the will of the other members of the afd . 
  also news reported that some people from the party executive want to take away the voting right of unemployed people/the lower class . 
   ( the von storch bitch for example ) i hate that woman . 
  only seeing her face makes my blood boil . 
  also , i guess that 's the reason they do n't want to be associated with the fn from france or any other `` actual '' extremist right wing party . 
  lots of rich people . 
  it 's still the jetset drug . 
  lots of rich party tourists as well , i guess . 
  those are asylum seekers ... and if you have a look at the approval rate , the state clearly checks who is a `` regular '' applicant and who is n't , 99.5 % percent of serbian asylum seekers where rejected and 96 % from syria where approved , because it is a war zone . 
  afghanistan , the same . 
   the `` refugees '' are the problem as they are mostly uneducated , do n't speak the language , and lack any applicable skills whatsoever . 
  it does n't matter because that 's not the reason they come here . 
   how so ? 
  in germany it 's done with a questionare , they ask pretty personal questions about your life and that of your spouse . 
   moreover , if two people start a family while one of the parents does not have a visa , they 're pretty irresponsible and selfish . 
  you do n't start a family when your children 's mother can be deported because she has no right to be there . 
  the right to stay comes from the child when it has the citizenship of the state they reside in , even if the parents are n't married . 
  at least that 's how it 's done in civilised states . 
   if they do n't want the state to be in the way , then why do they marry ? 
  since marriage 's nature is to be the state-recognized union . 
  if the state recognizes that union , what right does the state have to break it up against the will of the spouses ? 
  and in germany ( sorry , i do n't know the numbers for any other state because i mostly discuss those issues with germans ) family unification permits are on the decline . 
  most ( 10 ' 000 ~ ) applications came from serbia in 2012 in germany ( mostly rejected ) , 7500 from afghanistan ( mostly accepted ) , about 6000 from syria , 5000 from iraq , then macedonia , iran , pakistan , russia , bosnia , turkey . 
  most of them are n't even from africa ( except for syria , but it 's a war zone ) . 
  i wager it almost looks the same for austria .

  someone applies for asylum , it either gets accepted or rejected and then they are brought back . 
  they apply for asylum in the eu because that is the way it is handled by law , the law says you can only apply for asylum if you are in that particular state . 
  as far as i know switzerland was the last country that allowed applying in their embassys and this was discontinued in 2012 or 2013 . 
  maybe you mean something else though . 
  even then they should be allowed to live together . 
  i mean , it 's a family . 
  if you are afraid of fictitious marriage you can test for it , sure , but if two people want to start a family together the state should not be in the way . 
     canada or the us does n't grant automatic visa if you marry one of their national either . 
  truly horrible ~ ~ communist ~ ~ places , right ? 
  right edit : in terms of this , they are . 
  if one person earns enough to support the whole household , why ca n't the spouse live with them ? 
  what if one of them wants to be a stay-at-home dad/mom or just does n't need to work because the respective spouse earns enough ? 
  a family has the right to live together , no matter what .
