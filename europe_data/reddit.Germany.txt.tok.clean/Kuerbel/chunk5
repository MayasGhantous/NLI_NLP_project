  ridiculous . 
  http://mediendienst-integration.de/fileadmin/_migrated/rte/rtemagicc_asyl_europa_zahlen_2012.pdf.jpg yeah malta is quite high , but portugal and spain are not . 
  also they are not illegal immigrants . 
  illegal means they crossed the border without applying for asylum , but these people do . 
  they are asylum seekers . 
  asylum seekers are n't illegal . 
  do you really think it 's appropriate to call anyone `` human garbage '' , let alone members of a legal party ? 
  that 's despicable . 
  wikipedia says : the netherlands is a geographically low-lying country , with about 20 % of its area and 21 % of its population located below sea level , and 50 % of its land lying less than one metre above sea level . 
  interactive map : http://flood.firetree.net/, 
  http://www.sollichafdwaehlen.de/ another helpful link to decide wether to vote for the afd or not . 
  fascist is too harsh , but they are isolationist , very * very * conservative , extremly populistic and so on . 
  german butter is usually sold unsalted . 
  of course you can buy butter with salt as well , but it 's not as common, 
   yeah , i feel a little bit more light-hearted because of it . 
  it 's a miracle , haha, 
  we take our spaces [ very seriously ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plenken ) !, 
  i think it 's a ( very good ) photoshop . 
  the guy who did it forgot one simple thing : the mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum ( expiration date ) on top of the top right piece says `` 21/04/05 '' . 
   best beef and dairy products in europe . 
  your butter is being sold in germany . 
  i 've never seen imported dairy besides that and swedish milk . 
  it 's german and says `` where peace and unity reign '', 
  it 's not directly related to your post , but switzerland has no constitutional court , which means that there is no jurisdictional instance with the power to force the federal government to adhere to the constitution . 
  a major flaw imo . 
  also ,  because switzerland , australia and the usa are among the wealthiest nations in the world ? 
  umm ... that 's certainly not because of direct democracy . 
  you could also say despite of , because there are a lot of wealthy nations with very limited direct democracy , like germany . 
  the people who are interested in it are most often the kind whose children you want to go to school though ... e.g. 
  fundamentalists of any kind , be it religious or ideology, 
   most of the political parties disapprove here . 
  not really ? 
  only the left and to certain extent the greens ( who want to start from scratch ) . 
  the spd and cdu are both in favour of it , even if they criticize some things ... 
   i shall not let corrupt politicians in berlin and paris make decisions regarding my state i laughed . 
  that is something only a bavarian would say , are you even aware that you seem to be representing a stereotype ? 
  and of course the [ csu is n't corrupt at all . 
  [ mother fucking swiss ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/11pcs1/while_i_lived_in_an_apartment_i_kept_a_linksys/c6oqc3m ) ( read the comment , it 's funny ), 
  got german as well . 
  directly below it says :  my closest soulmates are in  finland , belgium, 
  no , automatically not . 
  however , downvote patterns , amassing of opposers of immigration at the same time in the same thread ( which is pretty uncommon for / r/europe ) , and 1 day old accounts are a dead giveaway that there are at least some people trying to promote an agenda . 
  * sniffs * blergh , who let stormfront in here again ? 
  ireland is really beautiful , i went there often as a child , most often to roscommon county which is * great * if you love boats , rivers and lakes !, 
  it was a long time ago so i ca n't remember all the details . 
  i vividly remember to row on a lake , it had a small peninsula ( i guess ) on it with the ruin of a small castle . 
  i bet there are thousands of them in ireland , haha . 
  to be fair it means something if they identify with it . 
  it 's just that it 's pretty ... well , shallow to think that [ a description like this ] ( https://www.personalitypage.com/infj.html ) is able to describe your whole personality . 
  also , if you read it carefully , you 'll see that most of that stuff can be said about almost anyone . 
  ( or , rather , as people like to see themselves ... ), 
  of course you are , buddy . 
  of course you are . 
  they sure know how to make use of the forer effect !, 
  it was a joke , i think mbti is slightly more reliable than a horoscope , 
   pseudoscientific questionnaires , such as the meyers-briggs type indicator you take that back , how else am i going to be a scientifically sound * special * snowflake if i ca n't be an infj ? 
  2 is an alternative i could live with 3 is just terrible . 
  and do n't forget those good old [ auxiliary incomes ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-veroeffentlicht-nebeneinkuenfte-der-abgeordneten-a-959996.html ) , yeah sure , i always have time to work as a lawyer after 50-60 hours of parliamentary work each week and earn at least * 250 ' 000 $ * ( possibly twice or thrice as much ) . 
  who has n't ? 
  oh come on , we all know there is no corruption in germany . 
  what 's wrong with norways child welfare ? 
  well , [ this guy ] ( http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.interview-mit-general-ad-harald-kujat-die-nato-eskaliert-in-unrealistischer-weise.b6b45426-6a4b-41a2-b6a4-91a8cc72d469.html ) obviously disagrees . 
  and i 'm pretty sure he knows what he 's talking about . 
  english with scottish ( edinburgh ) accent . 
  edit : [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7v0w6a-_uu ) has a fairly generic scottish accent , but it sounds glorious . 
  9 out of 10 already earn more than that . 
  although i 'd prefer an alternative which includes already existing structures , or something that actually targets wage dumping specifically . 
  more collective labour agreements, 
  well , not as full of butt-hurt as your comment history , that 's for sure . 
  that 's some buttery drama right there . 
  well , i can understand that , they are a `` bit '' over the top . 
  still , they bring up some terrible shit that 's posted on the default subs and frequently upvoted . 
  maybe i should have written srsdiscussion instead . 
  well , perhaps them swiss should start to follow their constitution ( preamble ) : * ... and that the strength of a people is measured by the well-being of its weakest members ... *, 
  of course it was upvoted . 
  this sub constantly ( ! ), 
  gets brigaded by stromfront , like the rest of reddit . 
  add in the amount of closet racists that visit reddit by default , and here we are . 
  you ca n't blame every blatantly racist or derogatory comment on them , but if you have a serious look at srs you 'll see that there is racist shit upvoted in the default subs on a daily basis . 
  and that 's not only because there are le edgy gentlesirs defending le free speech . 
  today ? 
  nothing . 
  tomorrow ? 
  easter marches , 
  i ca n't think of anything ... french cuisine ? 
  i 'd say mountains but they got some of 'em in the south . 
  oh yes . 
  punctual train service like the sbb from switzerland would be nice, 
  british breakfast in general ( that one with sausages and mushrooms and tomato and thick cut marmalade and white beans in tomato sauce etc ) i love it ... 
  but sometimes , a croissant dipped in coffee ( french style ) tastes just as good . 
  aaah , australia . 
  britains prison . 
  not really , because - at least in germany - the education department accredites your certificate and equates it to the respective certificate from the german school system . 
  i bet this is the case in other eu countries as well . 
  i more or less learned english that way . 
  although i already knew quite a bit beforehand . 
  it does n't replace proper grammar lessons though , else you never know if you really are using the right tense . 
  it helps tremendously with sentence structure , vocabulary and idiomatic expressions . 
  edit : by all means , i still do a lot of mistakes but got to c1 level that way . 
  it 's not impossible .
