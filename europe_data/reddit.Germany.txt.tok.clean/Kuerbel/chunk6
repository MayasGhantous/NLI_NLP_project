  but to be honest , it 's not fun until you can read fluently , which takes some time . 
  well , they could accept school leaving certificates for starters . 
  i bet 90 % + of all citizens got one . 
  [ that 's ... that 's not how my voice sounds .

  it depends on what you want to actually compare . 
  it does n't make much sense to compare different regions to another like in this case . 
  however , it does make sense if you want to compare indicators , like gdp , educational level and so on because most of those ( eu made ) statistics are split up on nuts level edit : it even says they compared 42 different indicators , and i 'm pretty sure they did not collect all the data by themselves . 
  so maybe it was n't possible to compare it on another level . 
  it 's not arbitrary , it 's based on [ nuts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics#levels ) ... 
   i 'll tell you a story . 
  i am fairly against physically disciplining children , but i 'm also fairly open to criticism . 
  many people in italy tell me that a spank or a slap , or the famous wooden spoon is `` not like punching a child in the face '' . 
  i disagree but i understand . 
  i even had a long chat about it in r/italy , where i was quite alone on the issue . 
  the main idea was the one described above . 
  spanking and slapping is ok . oh , do n't worry . 
  it 's the same in germany . 
  it is forbidden , even . 
  section 1631 of the german civil code states that '' ( 2 ) children have a right to non-violent upbringing . 
  physical punishments , psychological injuries and other degrading measures are inadmissible '' , yet people , especially religious people , insist that it is within their god-given ( yes , they use that `` argument '' ) rights to punish their children as they see fit . 
  the pius society had to close a school because of this yet they still do n't understand . 
   http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/1percent-pay-tax-rate-80percent[6]  why the 1 % should pay tax at 80 % how is this extreme leftist ? 
  the author even says that a top tax rate of 70 % was normal in both us and uk in the 1970 's . 
  surely both countries were n't extreme leftist back then . 
  also , the rest of the article is quite well-rounded and balanced . 
  it discusses the effects of a high tax cap , compares the very low uk/us taxes to those in other succesfull countries like germany etc, 
  of course they are neutral . 
  they sell their weapons to everyone !,

  that 's a dickmove if i 've ever seen one, 
  [ chinas has closed its labour camps ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10561434/china-abolishes-its-labour-camps-and-releases-prisoners.html ), 
  well , i 'd start here : http://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/ on the sidebar are some more subreddits linked , maybe there is a singular `` moderate news '' subreddit somewhere . 
  are you disputing the fact that the denazification in west germany was a half-hearted attempt ? 
  because that would be actual revisionism . 
  it 's a completely undoubted fact . 
  what is it with you and your anti-german bullshit ? 
   first the us liberated germany from an oppressive regime . 
  it did not . 
  it was the british , the french and the sovjets * and * the us . 
  stop implying they did everything on their own . 
   then the us brought economic prosperity never seen before ( even not in glorious muh reich days ) . 
  the marshall plan was heavily disputed in the us , also i 'm pretty sure germany would have been able to get its shit together on its own after a while . 
  after all , it went from the constraints of the treaty of versailles to one , if not the biggest , war machine in a few years . 
   and then the us prevented germany and west europe from becoming soviet . 
  again , it was not the us all alone . 
  also , this was done with the help of former nazis because of a half-arsed denazification , which in turn let the east german government exploit this and build up an anti-fascist myth , which in turn was a central part of their propaganda . 
  because their denazification was thorough . 
  judging by your comment history i am pretty sure you are russian and perhaps paid by the russian government . 
   i will pay our `` solidarity tax '' until i am old and grey it should run out in a few years but they want to incorporate it into the income tax ... 
  you ca n't just buy property as a foreigner in switzerland . 
  just saying . 
  there are some old-fashioned german words like `` hypokrit '' ( hypocrite ) which are basically the same in english . 
  advokat < -  advocate , abjekt < -  abject , exazerbation < -  exacerbation ... 
  i somehow got a knack for etymology n stuff . 
  you mean there are only politicians posting on / r/adviceanimals ? 
  note to self : do n't let britannia use the space lift 2nd note : call it space elevator, 
  i am officially elected by the soon-to-be state of kuerbelopia to hereby represent kuerbelopia in / r/europe , and i propose to add a kuerbelopian flag . 
  ah , change all the flags to kuerbelopia , we soon have conquered all of europe anyways . 
  edit : seriously though , i think it 's a good idea . 
  i changed to the europe flair purely for this reason . 
  it 's funny to directly experience the difference between having a german flair and something not as easily allocable .

  sad to hear that . 
  a language is not only a means of communication but also of artistic expression . 
  it 's like losing a shade or a note . 
  `` why is italy shaped like a boot '' no , it 's the other way around . 
  boots are shaped like italy, 
  oettinger is a terrible politician and person all around . 
  all the shenanigans he tried to pull in germany ... 
  got another one  what do you think about the swiss vote about immigration quotas and what was the corridor talk in brussels , so to speak ? 
  do you believe that the `` guillotine clause '' will be invoked ? 
  what do think of the german renewable energy act and it 's consequences ? 
  if you 're not familiar enough with it to answer this question , no problem, 
   the siege of sevastopol was the gun 's first combat test . 
  well ... 
  that guys name ? 
  as long as you deliberately misunderstand everything i say , i do n't need to talk to you . 
   i just think that greece should reform it pharmacies , to match the rest of the eu . 
  i have not said otherwise . 
  i just said it 's not necessary to sell medicaments in supermarkets to get in a more competititive position and i provided an example ( german pharmacies ) to support my stance . 
  i do n't know how you can possibly not understand that the way it was intended . 
   are you seriously saying that germany is as corrupt as greece ? 
  of course not . 
  i just said we suffer from the same problems , just to a lesser extent . 
  in most , hell , even all cases a lot less . 
  does n't mean they ca n't get back to their feet , but just as it says in the article : those imf demands may not be the best way to go . 
  just because something is harsh does n't mean it 's successful . 
  you ca n't buy over-the-counter drugs in german supermarkets . 
  they are marked as `` to be sold in pharmacies only '' ( apothekenpflichtig ) . 
  i do n't know who exactly you 're talking about when you say `` the rest of the eu '' , since that is still up to every country to decide . 
   and , what is right for greece 's economy is not being in the euro , not being corrupt , not having the bureacracy they are having , not suffer internal devaluation , etc. 
  yeah , sure thing buddy . 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's no corruption in germany at all . 
  [ that 's why we ~ ~ ratified ~ ~ signed the un convention against corruption ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_convention_against_corruption#signatures.2c_ratifications_and_entry_into_force ) . 
  we are in good company . 
  like north korea . 
  ... what ? 
  first , i 'm german , and second , i just explained to you what i think about that specific reform , not any other , because it puts people at an unnecessary risk . 
  there are a myriad of other ways to bring those prices down , e.g.
