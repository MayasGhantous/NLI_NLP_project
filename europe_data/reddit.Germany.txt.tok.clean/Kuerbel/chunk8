  i read it and it was interesting . 
  just a heads up , your post will probably be read by hundreds of people . 
  also ,  all this is changing though at the moment , maybe also thanks to the german immigration , which brings in a lot of young and urban cosmopolites , the very antithesis to the general swiss self-concept . 
  that 's another reason why the swiss do n't like the germans immigrating i guess . 
  entirely different mindset on a lot of things . 
  did i say that somewhere ? 
  i just said that if you do n't want to join the eu at all costs , maybe you should accept the reality , and that is that switzerland depends on the eu . 
  not the other way around . 
  i 'm in no way a communist ( authoritarian systems are despicable ) , but it seriously ca n't go on like this . 
  i just read that your average swiss family ( and it wo n't be any different for any west european or american family ) needs 180 % more ressources than what is sustainable ( so , 280 % ), 
  yes , because they have adopted most of the eu legislation already . 
  switzerland has to accept ( almost ) everything that comes from the eu yet they ca n't speak their opinion simply because they are not an actual eu member . 
  also , they pay huge sums to the eu already as well , so that 's not an argument against joining . 
  all in all switzerland could only profit . 
  damn civilisation , makes everything complicated ... 
  that was interesting . 
  obviously i 'm a leftist libertarian ( economic left/right : -9.88 social libertarian/authoritarian : -8.00 ) . 
  thanks !, 
  and who defines what a `` good cause '' is ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not a strict pacifist , i think a state is capable of using the military in a humanitarian way , but my biggest fear is that they are going to use it for economic gains . 
  and yes , that is despicable . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_swiss_citizens just about the same , i guess ? 
   but perhaps i am just a dinosaur for thinking men and women have different inborn qualities . 
  yes, 
  socialism and communism are n't synonyms though . 
  that 's quite the opposite of what i meant , but , eh , thank you , i guess ? 
  boy , do i wish the german spd has such balls ... 
  [ switzerland is pretty much part of the eu already ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/switzerland%e2%80%93european_union_relations ) , although no politician would ever say it out loud . 
  just read the article , they pay into eu budget , they take part in eu csfp operations , they adopted most of the law yet they ca n't make their voice heard . 
  they have to accept the laws made by the eu , or the guillotine clause will come into effect . 
  in case one of both parties use the guillotine clause , switzerland will have no other choice than to join the eu , simply because of economic reasons .

  suggestions are welcome !, 
  `` dear friends , who is coming to us , who wants to stay permanently , who does not organize parallel societies , who wants cooperation instead of conflict , they are welcome , and especially if they are able to make a living . '', 
  first part `` whereas we have reservations and concerns about , and what we are going to defend until the last bullet in the great coalition is , dear friends , and never give in to , is that we are going to have an immigration into the german welfare system '' the important part is `` until the last bullet '' , he knew exactly what he said there , and it was * literally * the order the troops in berlin had after the 2nd ww , it 's just typical right-wing rhetoric .

  downvoting him because of his opinion is already against the rediquette . 
  and while the first paragraph of his post may not be the most eloquent or thoughtful one it 's still related to the topic edit : unlike our posts , which is why i wo n't reply anymore . 
   the oil container thing is less clear cut but one could still make a case for it . 
  that 's pretty easy , because most restaurants serve the oil in jugs and some of them just use inferior oil to save money but declare it as olive oil .

  why not dictatorship ?

  work is the important point . 
  you ca n't just go to another country and demand welfare , even with open borders . 
   i do n't remember that such things happened in the evil-capitalist west europe . 
  because you have n't had proper history lessons ? 
  at least in germany there were two food shortages during the past century . 
  in 1916/17 was the first , it 's called the `` steckr\u00fcbenwinter '' ( turnip winter ) . 
  it was during the first world war and while not directly caused by a trade embargo it exacerbated the existing problems . 
  ( not enough farmers / land , huge import of food before the war , potato blight ... ) 800 ' 000 people died between 1914 and 1918 the second one was after the second world war 46/47 , it was the coldest winter of the century . 
  there was not enough milk to feed the children and babies , a lot of them died . 
   regardless , prominent german commentators are already denouncing the deal , even before it has been unveiled , as an ugly mix of lowest-common-denominator policies that fail to address the country 's most pressing challenges -- from an ageing population to a costly shift out of nuclear power . 
  and that 's true . 
  nothing good will come out of this ( except maybe minimum wage ) . 
  that 's just not how the german political system works , they will have more than 75 % of all seats in the bundestag ( parliament ) . 
  that means the opposition which has the task to kind of supervise the government to be in line with the constitution has less than 25 % of seats . 
  they ca n't do anything , not requesting an enquiry board , not appealing to the constitutional court . 
   ketchup on pasta . 
  that 's delicious . 
  edit : add a lot of grated cheese until the ketchup and cheese start to stick together and form little balls . 
  then , cut your spaghetti until they fit on a fork and put some of those ketcheese balls on them .

  yes it is . 
  the whole street is listed . 
  what does this have to do with street view , you ask ? 
  well , seems like wikipedia found an interest in pictures of listed buildings . 
  consequently , a picture of my house is in wikimedia commons . 
  i compared wikipedia and street view and guess what ? 
  every house that has been blurred out in my street is perfectly visible on wiki . 
  and no , i 'm not comparing apples and oranges here . 
  literally everyone can make a foto of your house and upload it . 
  it 's just the two of us . 
  and do n't tell me that 's insane , because i already try to find the source . 
  i have my guess though - 2 computers , old halogen bulbs ... 
  i bought new bulbs and try to use my phone instead of my computer , maybe buy a small tablet or convertible and use that power guzzler less often . 
  hopefully it 'll help .

  as an avid pink floyd fan , [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4ddvnl9f1w ) came to my mind . 
   though it deals with the disappointment after the fall of the wall , so ... there 's that .

  must be a common error though [ germany yes ] ( http://www.engrish.com/wp-content/uploads//2013/10/german-type-sexual-harassment.jpg ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/administration_of_federal_assistance_in_the_united_states i think that was it . 
   i agree that certain wealth transfers should be placed it 's the usual thing to do . 
  the us has such a system in place , switzerland has ( and switzerland is tiny , but even there wealth/demand/production is just not equally distributed ) , germany has , and i think a whole bunch of other countries have . 
  [ at the beginning of 2013 , the debate played out in germany , the largest and strongest single economy in the union . 
  while jens weidmann , president of the german bundesbank expressed reservations about the so-called outright monetary transactions programme ( omt ) in mid-year 2012 , `` some predict that chancellor angela merkel is simply waiting for victory in the september election [ in 2013 ] to declare support for a full-scale european transfer union '' , per commentator david marsh . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union#proposed_transfer_union ), 
  we could adjust our wages because they are - most often - ridiculously low when compared to germanys output , for starters . 
  or introducing a minimum wage of 9-10 $ . 
  edit : that would mean less exports but higher domestic demand, 
  sounds exactly like my childhood . 
  except that i was born and raised in switzerland . 
  was it world of warcraft , per chance ? 
  that was my first mmo . 
  it was okay but i played faaaar too often , lol .
