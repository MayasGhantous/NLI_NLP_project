   meanwhile the former government runs everything like before . 
  i 'm not sure if they are able to propose , change and pass a low though . 
  they passed a lot of lows , it 's actually astounding ^ ^ sorry , ^ ^ just ^ ^ had ^ ^ to, 
  i have two favourite recipes . 
  the first one is 6 lemons , 2 oranges , 250gr powdered sugar and 600ml water . 
  just squeeze the lemons and the oranges , filter it with a kitchen roll or clean towel , add water and sugar and stir well . 
  this one still has a lot of sugar , but i do n't drink it very often . 
  maybe once a month on a special occasion ... 
  the other one is made with honey instead of sugar . 
  heat 150gr honey and 500ml water up , scratch out a vanilla pod and add both vanilla pulp and pod . 
  let it cook for 4-5 minutes , then take it off the stove and let it cool down . 
  squeeze 6-7 lemons until you have ~ 350ml juice and pour it in a can . 
  add the honey syrup and stir . 
  then add ~ 4 litre of water and stir again . 
  i really like this one , it tastes sweet and lemony but has a lot less sugar .

  while [ riding on a dinosaur ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_akghmz7yi14/s6orvahjhci/aaaaaaaaaho/-exi33leg1y/s1600/jesus+riding+a+dinosaur---etsy-marketing-riding-dinos3.jpg ) ? 
  i like to prepare lemonade by myself . 
  and coca cola ... well , as a woman , i 'm not eager to suffer from osteoporosis ( which is clearly linked to it ) , or [ muscle problems ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090519075420.htm ), 
  that 's common in northern germany as well . 
  in the south not so much . 
  i think it 's pretty neat , because then you * get * cake on several different occasions through the year instead of once . 
  must be cheshire . 
  in the legend it says that the data from cheshire is from 2009-2011 , so i googled [ cheshire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:cheshire_uk_locator_map_2010.svg ) and it seems to be that area edit : some of the blue parts which are not located in germany are from 2009-11 , like the southern finland province ( etela-suomi ) and i bet `` pohjois-ja it\u00e4 - suomi '' is that big northern province . 
  ( i do n't know anything about finland though , haha . 
  just a guess . ), 
  if you get sick or have an accident while working , who has to pay for it in britain ? 
  in germany its the [ german statutory accident insurance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_statutory_accident_insurance ) , so it 's in the employers best interest to avoid accidents since they have to pay for it anyways . 
  my favorite one : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmwta9qrq0o english translation : thoughts are free , who can guess them ? 
  they fly by like nocturnal shadows . 
  no man can know them , no hunter can shoot them with powder and lead : thoughts are free !, 
  i think what i want , and what delights me , still always reticent , and as it is suitable . 
  my wish and desire , no one can deny me and so it will always be : thoughts are free !, 
  and if i am thrown into the darkest dungeon , all these are futile works , because my thoughts tear all gates and walls apart : thoughts are free !, 
  so i will renounce my sorrows forever , and never again will torture myself with whimsies . 
  in one 's heart , one can always laugh and joke and think at the same time : thoughts are free !, 
  i love wine , and my girl even more , only her i like best of all . 
  i 'm not alone with my glass of wine , my girl is with me : thoughts are free !, 
   no , we become a society where the poor are not enjoying an advantage over the non-poor in taxation , education , healthcare etc. 
  seriously , in what country is this the case ? 
  the upper and middle class is always , always better off . 
  also , everyone profits from a good education system ( = well educated workforce , less crime ) , socialized healthcare ( = the us healthcare is less efficient than those in countries with socialized healthcare [ in a 2013 bloomberg ranking of nations with the most efficient health care systems , the united states ranks 46th among the 48 countries included in the study . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/health_care_in_the_united_states ) ) , and taxation - are you kidding me ? 
  well , to be fair , there 's still some arguing going on between historians if the nsdap was capitalistic or anticapitalistic ( see german wiki : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalsozialismus#kapitalismus_und_antikapitalismus ) i think this discussion goes beyond the scope of this subreddit though . 
  edit : also , this has nothing to do with left or right wing , the nsdap was clearly right wing with their social darwinism and racism . 
   he claims research shows that as much as 70 % of a child 's performance is genetically derived . 
  what research ? 
  what studies ? 
  how do you prove something like this - twin studies ? 
  and even then , there is a myriad of other factors playing a role , epigenetics , teachers , motivation , interest ... 
  a lot of countries have something like the `` l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich '' . 
  even the usa . 
  on eu level theres eu cohesion policy . 
  all i can find on the english wikipedia is [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_cohesion_fund ) article though . 
  imo it looks like anyone can claim benefits as long as he is an eu citizen , but that 's not the case . 
  there are still conditions that have to be met . 
  it 's a bit too sensationalist for my liking, 
  title is a bit misleading imo . 
  i have three hours of experience using a wiimote and i have flown a plane ^ ^ in ^ ^ a ^ ^ game already . 
  also , i 'm not afraid of death . 
  do you need another test pilot , per chance ? 
  minimum salary in switzerland is considered about 4000 swiss francs . 
  it 's expensive like that . 
  especially rent . 
  * especially rent * . 
  a high school ( gymnasium ) teacher gets around 7000 euro ( not francs -  ca 8500 francs ) a month in the canton of bern , and that is considered `` low income '' for someone with a masters degree . 
  in the private sector you usually earn 20 % more ( depends on the degree and field of course , can be much more ) poverty line is at around 2200 chf per adult source : want to become a teacher in switzerland , read that in a study , can provide some google research if need be interesting is the purchasing power parity though ... that 7000 euro salary in switzerland is equal to the ~ 3500 $ you get in germany, 
  head over to / r/snackexchange  i bet there 's someone who wants some delicious french candies . 
  [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) strikes again . 
  and that responsibility starts when you export weapons . 
   ** every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signifies , in the final sense , a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed . 
  ** this world in arms is not spending money alone . 
  it is spending the sweat of its laborers , the genius of its scientists , the hopes of its children . 
  it 's a bit ironic that eisenhower said that , but what he said is the truth . 
  every weapon will find its war . 
  it does n't matter who buys it , it does n't matter who you are selling to , after 45 germany should know better , and every goddamn country in europe should know better than to sell weapons . 
  that is responsibility . 
  i wo n't deny that a un-peacekeeping mission is or at least can be a good thing . 
  but nothing good has come from the nato . 
  who is responsible for the peace in europe ? 
  the eu !, 
  not the nato . 
  the nato is just another tool for the us to try to push europe to do what they want . 
  we have the manpower and the knowledge to defend ourselves if the need should ever arise again . 
  the nato is a relict from the cold war , nothing more . 
  they are as left as the spd was under brandt . 
  compare the positions . 
  they are neither extremists nor communists . 
  it 's just propaganda from the spd . 
  the spd did the same thing the labour party did in the uk , a slide to the right . 
  and seriously , the einheitspartei feels much too comfortable . 
  it 's time for a damn change !, 
  ( note that i 'm not a german citizen ... yet . 
  agenda 2010 ... 
   we technically do n't have a constitution this is simply not true . 
  the gg * is * germanys constitution . 
  this is just a rumour , i do n't know why so many people believe it but it 's not true . 
  this was discussed intensively in both the bundestag and - rat in the `` gemeinsame verfassungskomission '' . 
  wikipedia has an article about it : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gemeinsame_verfassungskommission, 
  i 'm swiss and why can i understand dutch ?
