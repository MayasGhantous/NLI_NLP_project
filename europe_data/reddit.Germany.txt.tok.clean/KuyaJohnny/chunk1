moral grounds my ass . 
  they act like russia is doing this super evil thing while not only letting saudi arabia do way worse shit , no , they even * support * them . 
  i guess lives only matter when they 're european . 
  at least thats the message they are sending . 
  i really dont get your point . 
  russia took a part of ukraine which already is pretty messed up . 
  saudi arabia is straight up trying to destroy a whole fucking country , that 's ** way ** worse . 
  same thing applies to all of them . 
  lets sanction russia and sell weapons to saudi arabia . 
  hypocrisy at its best . 
  doesnt matter , they 're in power now . 
  as you can see, 
  ah yes , remember a year ago when all those polish people on here would tell you how great pis is for poland and downvote you to hell if you dare say anything bad against them ? 
  good times . 
  eh , its really not that bad . 
  i mean it is bad , but then again clinton would have been just as bad , just in another way . 
  there is no bad choice if you can only choose between a douche and a turd sandwich . 
  ah yes , an article about beer and the majority of comments is about refugees . 
  found the guy who never was anywhere near germany, 
  the ue . 
  sounds good . 
  you might want to try reading the article . 
  is it tho ? 
  i remember a lot of ppl saying how terrible pis is and how voting for them would be a terrible idea . 
  remember that one german reporter on twitter ? 
  some ppl just did not want to listen . 
  your logic is flawed . 
  both sides have exactly 2 options : have a child or do not have a child . 
  the problem is that the woman has ** all ** the power in this situation . 
  if the man wants it and the women does not , she just has a abortion . 
  end of story . 
  if the man does not want it but the woman does , she just has it . 
  again , end of story . 
  i think we can both agree that this is nowhere fair for the man , which is the whole point of this thread . 
  again ?? 
  how did these people even manage to get there again ? 
  you 'd think airport security would learn a thing after the first time that shit happened . 
  this state has a population of ~ 1.6 mio . 
  3 % are really no big deal at all . 
  meh , the whole state of mv makes up roughly 2 % of the german population . 
  there is nothing significant about this portion . 
  for germany ? 
  where its between status quo ( merkel ) or a more left-wing government ( schulz ) ? 
  what exactly are you hoping ? 
  go read a history book, 
  thats what nordstream ii is for . 
  you know of exactly ** one ** incident , how could you possible come to the conclusion that its `` primarily not ethnic germans ( incredibly stupid term btw ) doing this '' ? 
  so she will * not * win the election 3 times in a row and counting ? 
  sounds about right, 
  actually 100 % your problem , since the people who make all the money dont want to change anything . 
  they are perfectly fine with you not getting what you want . 
  it should . 
  but at this point there is so much money involved , it will be painfully hard to change it . 
  so what do you propose ? 
  thats not how any of this works, 
  and in addition to that : laws . 
  just get rid of fucking dual citizenship . 
  that shit is just causing problems left and right, 
  is there a way to aquire such box outside of finland ? 
  sounds pretty interesting, 
  declaring bankcruptcy doesnt solve the underlying problems . 
  they start fresh and then the same shit happens . 
  with the addition that they cant take loans for like 10 ( !? ), 
  years . 
  neither . 
  its `` look , your asylum request will very likely be denied . 
  take some money , leave and save us all some time and work '', 
  and how exactly are they going to come back to austria ? 
  dude , thats a 50 % increase, 
  and thats why brain drain happens , kids . 
  only if they 're german citizens . 
  which they 're not . 
  this time with love !, 
  hey bulgaria , wan na join the nazi club ? 
  28 $ is the best we can do, 
  keep in mind that its just the insa poll, 
  since 2001 i guess ? 
  its called `` civil union '' or whatever but the rest is pretty much the same , except the adoption part . 
  we 'll get there eventually, 
  how does that work ? 
  see thats the point no trump supporter likes to talk about . 
  most germans dont want any american soldiers in germany . 
  but there is no way that the us is removing any of their bases in germany because they are highly important for them regarding their operations in africa and the middle east . 
  us bases in germany are not doing shit for germany ( except curb the local economy a bit i guess ) . 
  but they are important as fuck for the us . 
  they are like a leper , no party wants to go anywhere near them . 
  afd has no shot at anything in germany . 
  its going to be merkel or schulz , both very far away from eurosceptism . 
  dual-citizenship is one of the dumbest things ever . 
  got ta get rid of that nonsense asap, 
  thats the point . 
  people will opt for a nice life with 2 children ( the average for turks in europe ) instead of turning into a baby factory for that clown, 
  really ? 
  dude has a very obvious accent, 
  his point is very clear . 
  the irony in his post is that he is complaining about people looking down on entrepreneurs and then in the very next sentence he start looking down on people working for big/established companies . 
  risk aversion is high in germany ... very high . 
  personally , i absolutely understand it . 
  thats because there are like 10 people living in luxemburg, 
  eastern germans are the one who hate russia the most,
