  and if you look at the women-men breakdown you see that women in both countries have the same score ( 70 % in poland , 69 % in ghana ) while men actually make the difference here ( 57 % in poland , 62 % in ghana ) . 
  [ what i 'm talking about ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/18124223/ft_17.01.13_womenrights.png ), 
   top actors , singers and celebrities i actually dont think this is the case, 
  you do realize that christianity , especially catholicism , is not particulary women friendy either , right ? 
  its what you make of it, 
  you think ? 
  i have a couple of friends who are from kosovo and they all have a giant ladyboner for this ledri vula dude, 
  i did expect ba-w\u00fc and bayern at the top but i was pretty impressed to see rlp right behind them . 
  definitely good stuff, 
   i 'm not blaming germany , they 're doing what 's best for them , i 'm blaming my politicians who were n't smart enough to forecast the future implications of the new currency . 
  you 're probably getting downvoted for that other stuff but i really respect you for that sentence because its a reasonable assessment of the situation instead of the usual `` germany ruined my country '' crap . 
  south germany is best germany, 
   i 'm confused , is n't trump on our side ? 
  i 'd say trump is mainly on his own side . 
  he 'll try to get what is best for the us ( as he should btw ) , not the uk . 
  dont take it serious . 
  its a bit of a running joke because over at / r/germany we constantly get americans who want to move to germany and think that because they have some distant german relative they are german and/or eligible for german citizenship, 
  he 's probably going to post on / r/germany soon that his great-great-great-grandfather was 1/16 german and if that makes him eligible for a german passport, 
  and some of us are apparently there right now, 
  come on , teenagers are idiots . 
  we 've all been there, 
  yeah that doesnt look right at all . 
  i highly doubt that this graph is even remotely accurate, 
  i saw a thread explaining this just this morning on the front page but i cant find it now unfortunately . 
  basically , you cant compare national debt to consumer debt . 
  its more like a stock market . 
  every country offers national bonds and pretty much everyone ( companies , banks , regular people , etc. ), 
  can buy these bonds and thereby `` lend '' money to the country . 
  if you say so, 
  honestly , i dont see anything wrong with the selfies . 
  just people making pictures of themselves at a public interesting looking place . 
  this site on the other side just makes me cringe . 
  shit is too edgy . 
  vw owns 100 % of porsche ag , but porsche se owns 50,7 % of vw which makes them the majority owner . 
  [ this infographic gives you an overview ] ( http://media0.faz.net/ppmedia/aktuell/wirtschaft/1484956965/1.3559226/default-retina/hq/infografik-der-vw-konzern.jpg ), 
  thats what happens if you take quotes out of context, 
  thats already happening . 
  one of the reason why the npd became even more irrelevant in recent years, 
  in the common market, 
  i have a really hard time understanding how anyone could take this wilders guy serious, 
  well thats simple then . 
  you said earlier that it would be okay for them to declare independance , right ? 
  so they become independent and then let themselves by choice get annexed by serbia . 
  they dont oppose the annexation so its not by force . 
  problem solved i suppose ? 
  its a bit complicated . 
  vw ag owns porsche ag but at the same time is majority owned by porsche holding se, 
  to be fair , volkswagen is majority owned by porsche, 
  read the article , its right there, 
  you done messed up turkey, 
  judging by the title you 'd think they want a eu wide universal income, 
  yeah i know who he is and what his deal was . 
  nowhere does it even mention the whole iran/shia/turkish / kurdish stuff . 
  as i said , sounds like bullshit . 
  because him being iranian had nothing to do with anything . 
   he was a teenager who was being bullied because he was iranian ( shia ) and not turkish/kurdish like the others . 
  source ? 
  sounds like bullshit . 
  he saw himself as german , as arian to be more exact . 
  he was racist as fuck , proud to share a birthday with hitler and he did that shit on the anniversary of the breivik shooting . 
  oh yeah he said it so it must be true . 
  his word has 0 value . 
  that would probably make the world a slightly better place, 
  he got what ? 
  48-49 % of the votes ? 
  lets not act like almost noone voted for him . 
  thats terrible journalism . 
  the moment you forget you start repeating . 
   white guilt obsession/fetish white guilt , right . 
  i see you are very informed on that matter, 
   and atrocities committed against the native americans . 
  everyone knew about that 50 years ago too . 
  most still dont really care about it . 
   it may be a shocker for you but karma and attention does n't make your arguments more logical nor coherent . 
  but having an older account does ? 
  well yeah . 
  everyone likes to only see what they want to see . 
  somehow everyone forgets that one month before her infamous speech that a lot of media outlets completely took out of context she literally made a arabic girl cry on tv by telling her that not everyone can stay ( in germany ) . 
  there is a reason why germans are never letting themselves forget what happened here 70 years ago, 
  well , ** 2 whole percent ** voted for the bayern-party so obviously bayern is on the brink of civil war, 
  guardian `` journalists '' probably dont know any other german politicians . 
  from what i 've gathered so far you have to make fun of finland and/or the netherlands for beating them, 
  yes i 'm sure life in croatia is way better, 
  cant decide between \\ # 4 and \\ # 5 but yeah , i dont see how she did win this one, 
  first of all , i 'd bet that the majority of germans dont even know that you can bet on elections . 
  second , i checked out the german election part on that side and it makes no sense . 
  it says `` most seats '' and then it lists a few politicians , some from the same party . 
  so what exactly are they going for here ? 
  because a politician can only have one seat . 
  but why list several politicians from the same party if you mean the party ? 
  its either some kind of scam where they want to screw people over who dont know how the german election even works or they themselves have no clue how any of it works . 
  did you actually explain who/what the csu is to a german ? 
   this rise has been totally preventable unlike the other and more dangerous things . 
  do you think train accidents are some kind of force of nature or something ? 
  they are totally preventable as well and have killed 5x as many people last year . 
  yet somehow nobody is losing his mind about them . 
  the terror issue definitely needs to be tackled and it is being tackled . 
  no need to go bonkers about it tho . 
  well russia did its part so far , ukraine is not following through, 
   cdu/csu/afd there is a 0 % chance that is happening .
