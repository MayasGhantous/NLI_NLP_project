  noone ( except the npd maybe but they 're irrelevant anyways ) wants anything to do with the afd and the afd itself keeps saying that they wont form a coalition . 
  the spd is tanking way too hard for a red-red-green coalition to happen, 
   ukraine and russia with ** germany and france as `` mediators '' ** . 
  you really need to work on your reading comprehension dude . 
  i did highlight the mediators for you since you somehow didnt manage to figure it out by yourself . 
  for everything else just read the wiki article , its not particulary long or complicated . 
  ukraine and russia with germany and france as `` mediators '' . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk_ii ) you find everything about the agreement including the measures both ukraine and russia agreed to . 
  that totally happened . 
  itt : lots of people who for some reason are unable to read and understand an agreement signed by ** both ** sides . 
  its a caricature , nothing immature or inadequate about that . 
  their loss then, 
  meanwhile baden-w\u00fcrttemberg is preparing the annexiation of augsburg . 
  its about time that we take our district back . 
  the porzingod ? 
  `` gabriel , '' with a comma, 
  12 regular payments for the months + christmas bonus + `` vacation bonus '' ( at least thats how its called here in germany , `` urlaubsgeld '' ) i guess ? 
  thats not what the article is saying , like at all . 
  besides ,  change their tune to `` well you ca n't just send them back ! '' . 
  is basically the same as  until they are able to go back home . 
  so what the hell are you even trying to say ? 
  huh ? 
  the term refugee itself already implies that they only stay temporary . 
  what you 're saying is that 40 % dont even know what a refugee is . 
  must be the worst money grab ever considering that even if they win they get none . 
  isnt it reasonable to expect long wait times when you have so many people applying ? 
  it sucks for them , sure , but thats just how it is . 
  and whats even the point in suing when there is already a law in place that clearly states when family is allowed to come over ? 
  serious question , because i really dont understand it . 
  that doesnt make you german . 
  if you 'd commit a crime in germany it would show up on that map you posted . 
   given a minimum wage of 8.84 $ it might be important to note that the minimum wage is not `` the norm '' for minijobs , a lot of them pay you ~ 10 $ / hour , at least the ones i 've seen . 
  good stuff, 
  it is garbage because it completely exaggerates the whole situation and blames it on austerity to manipulate people who read it . 
  which is the case more often than not lately with the guardian . 
  yet another garbage article by the guardian . 
  welp, 
   nobody 's talking about a coalition between cdu/csu and fdp anymore , or one between spd and the greens , which used to be the two main blocks . 
  why do you think we have a great colation now ? 
  the fdp ruined themselves years ago and it had absolutely nothing to do with neither putin nor the afd . 
  a somewhat similar thing happened to the spd . 
  thats why we dont talk about these coalitions anymore . 
  blaming putin for everything is just petty . 
   no other country literally forbids a part of their country from leaving . 
  ukraine actually did but thats a topic for another day, 
  how does the turnout matter ? 
  your own fault if you dont use your right to vote . 
  `` anhalten '' would be `` stop '' i guess and `` festhalten '' i dont know , really depends on the context . 
  maybe `` retain '' or `` stop '' . 
  there were also 1500 + police officers in action to match the number of people who had to be checked . 
  and lets not act like there is only one possible translation . 
  you might as well translate it as `` verhaften '' or `` sistieren '' ( taking them back to the station to check their identity ) . 
  that only applies when the person is not carrying an id or anything similar that identifies them . 
  stopping someone and checking his/her id takes ~ 2 mins . 
  top . 
  stopping someone and checking his id is something entirely different than detaining someone . 
  92 people have been detained . 
  thats not `` hundreds '' . 
  not even `` hundred '' to be precise, 
  usually its because they act aggressive or are very visibly drunk or just generally act `` rowdy '' . 
  so police tells them to leave before any kind of escalation can happen . 
  syrians and iraqis are actually fleeing from war and are thankful that germany actually offers them a safe place to stay . 
  north africans just want to improve their economic situation . 
  just the guardian trying to rile up people over nothing ... as usual . 
  how is new year a christian holiday ? 
  i totally agree . 
  just sanction the fuck out of every country that doesnt cooperate . 
  noone says you are not allowed to be worried . 
  most would probably agree with you on that point . 
  just because you would n't do it does not make it a fact either . 
  i can only repeat what i wrote earlier : people can be scumbags/criminals and be in danger at the same time . 
  thats really not a fact at all . 
  bad people and/or criminals can still be in danger , you get that right ? 
  doesnt make what they do right of course and we really should think about kicking the ones who commit crime out immediately but its not always that easy . 
  everyone is free to apply for asylum . 
  they most likely get denied , but until the whole procedure is done they have a right to stay . 
  this is the first step . 
  the next one should be changing asylum law . 
  make the possession of a legit passport a requirement and dont even allow people without one to request asylum . 
  detecting fake passport shouldnt be that hard and it would make sending them back to the right country way easier . 
  the guardian lying his ass off just to get a few clicks ? 
  shocker !, 
   which most of them are in germany only for the social money , without will to work . 
  i 'm sure you have a source for that . 
  then improve your country and your working conditions instead of playing the victim card . 
  what exactly do you expect germany to do ? 
  why would they try to hide that ? 
  their only `` source '' was some secret us official . 
  so in other words they just pulled out a dramatic story out of their ass to sell some clicks . 
  literally garbage journalism . 
  oh the media knows that very well . 
  and they are using that to manipulate people . 
  i mean look at this comment section here . 
  half of the people commenting obviously havent read the article and are upset about something for no reason at all because the media wants them to be upset about it . 
  litarelly economic migrants . 
  yet somehow now its germanys fault lmao, 
  and everyone on redditjust believed that garbage because western media reported it and they could neeeeeever lie to us . 
  i wonder when people finally realize that media outlets like cnn , bbc , etc are the same shit as rt , just with another agenda . 
  garbage media is garbage . 
  noone is asking for a ban of those things , they are asking for a name change .
