  american ( standard ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  portuguese 2 . 
  chinese 3 . 
  spanish im native german and have never ever learned more than a sentence in two of these languages . 
  i suck at those tests - . -, 
  go back it up and dont just say google it . 
  the only thing i found was about the existence of muslimic financed schools and nothing more, 
  uhm germany doesnt have low wages at least not in the manufacturing sector . 
  they are actually in place 5 in the eu . 
  the ones that are higher are : sweden belgium denmark and france, 
  crap i thought the last one was 8 months ahh well, 
  we have plenty of sadistic morons in our army . 
  there was a scandal were they tortured the new people as part of the training . 
  people are people and asshole will always be assholes . 
  i doubt that that part will be dependent on where you live, 
  8 months ? 
  sounds like german conscription , but im not sure since i dont know anything about conscription in other countries, 
  because you said  lombardy has the highest gdp in italy that is the only reason i assumed we were talking total gdp, 
  slightly bigger . 
  it is along the line of 35k/22k usd for italy and 35k/23k $ for germany . 
  which means it is far from really relevant . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_italian_regions_by_gdp_%28ppp%29 i thought we were talking about gdp and not gdp per capita, 
  okay im now even more confused . 
  while i have only found data from 2007 that data indicates that lombardy has almost double the gdp as the second region lazio . 
  did the crisis hit lombardy that bad ? 
  if so could you forward me a better source ? 
  what led to my mistake is that you mentioned baden-w\u00fcrttemberg which is in no statistic i could find the most productive region in germany . 
  that would be either hamburg if you look at gdp per capita or nrw if you look at just the gdp . 
  that is not what i ment . 
  he said : if we exclude the parts of our country that do bad or not so good then we compare good to the whole of the other country . 
  my only point to that was under the premise that everything he said was right the part of the comment that i highlighted is only for his own national pride and would only be a fair comparision if we exclude the `` poor '' states of germany as well . 
  i just dont like those statistic gymnastics, 
   and again , considering how much less money the south makes it is safe to assume that northern italy was as productive or more productive than germany . 
  oh come on is it allowed for germany to exclude its east too ? 
  thanks to the ddr it is still lacking far behind the rest . 
  actually they want all the weak economies to get out of the euro if i remember right, 
  not really tanks are still tanks . 
  they are still a big heavy and good armoured vehicle with a big gun . 
  they are still useful and will continue in being so, 
  well they want to reform and that seems to be drastically different than what the kippers want . 
       i know people that variously define themselves as communists and anarchists . 
  both i now learn are prohibited from expressing basic fundamental views in germany . 
  that is not the mark of a democracy . 
  that is the mark of a tyranny . 
  where does this come from ? 
  we have anarchists in our student council and as far as i know they arent fined or arested for their views, 
  that is because the leo is dirt cheap in comparison to the two . 
  we might have a slight case of miscommunication and me trying to be a smart ass here : as far as i know there are no leopard 1 tanks anymore in reserve . 
  so the only tanks in reserve arent old tanks, 
  leopard 2a6 is the current tank for all german operations . 
  they just have 120 in reserve, 
  i woudnt call a leopard 2a6 exactly useless . 
  at least for the east mostly because of the military production there , but that would be the only reason i could think of, 
  6 or seven not exactly sure will be sent in summer, 
  i felt that i had heard this already 2 years before . 
  so was that not my imagination or omniscience ? 
  deutsche bank had it coming . 
  srsly if i remember right they have at the moment 3 billion euro on hold for law problems . 
  what the best party `` die partei '' has no tv spot ? 
  heresy !, 
  if you see them as the yellow cdu then yes . 
  source for the afd ones ? 
  they arent on the official afd site . 
  https://www.alternativefuer.de/wahlkampf/ edit : okay it seems that they are only locally used . 
  well they are still pretty stupid but okay, 
  not the snowden revelations alone but the reaction of the gouverment was a large factor in this, 
  so what should those countries do ? 
  stop exporting ? 
  regulate the industry to stop producing goods which are wanted around the world ? 
  i remember those sites prior to the last bundestagswahl . 
  all was afd will get at least 20 % !!!, 
  the established will have no chance !, 
  we will leave the euro and become a worldpower again !, 
  in the end the afd got 4.9 % and didnt got into the opposition and they were crying and screaming about vote manipulation and other nonesense those comments are not reprensative in any kind or way, 
  uhh you can also argue that many dont know the english classics . 
  i could only name shakespeare and after that i would know nothing, 
  you kind of forget holodomor . 
  you know the starving of the whole ukraine where about 3.5 million people died due to bad harvest and the massive taking of the sovjet union . 
  the same with crimea . 
  the tatars got deported their houses built up by russians and now we have a russian majority thanks to sowjet deportation and planned starvation, 
  that was after the anti protesting laws not before at least if i remember right, 
  ahh okay . 
  thank you, 
  sorry what are kippers ?
