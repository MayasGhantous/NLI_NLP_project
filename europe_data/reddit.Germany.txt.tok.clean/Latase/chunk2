  as the americans once said , no taxations without representation . 
  eastern europe is like our own reality tv show . 
  you ca n't make that up . 
  i have serious problems with this . 
  germany has also a right to take a position on its own . 
  for a long time the eu worked like that : someone throws a fit ( usually france ) and we cave in . 
  this model just does n't work for all eternity . 
  so when the euro was founded , we had a no-bailout-clause in the treaties , you know why ? 
  because a currency union needs the same economic values and because it was clear from the beginning that the southern nations have no fiscal discipline they could atleast go bankrupt on their own . 
  of course when it came to the worst , we caved in and did bailouts for a lot of states . 
  ask yourself where all the other big states are and why we do n't hear anything from them like france that currently wants to destroy the euro and europe on their own through reckless spending , too . 
  then there is italy which is its own shitshow . 
  we did n't hear any plans on how to continue from anyone else except throw money at them . 
  but `` germoney gib plox '' is not a viable strategy for anything . 
  to blame us then for the inaction of everyone else is really not helpful in any way . 
  i refuse to take the responsibility that germany is destroying the europa , states like greece and france and hungary and britain are doing that well on their own if the only thing that binds europe together is german money maybe europa is n't viable anymore . 
  if europe wants to survive other countries really need to step up their game . 
  ( by the way the weight of germany in the euro is only 28.3 % , hardly a hegemon ) edit : also the only thing i read all day for the last 5 years is basically germans = nazis , so what reputation ? 
  fuck our reputation . 
  solidarity is when germany pays the bill after all . 
  bailouts are technically also forbidden by the eurozone rules , so there is that , but at this point no one cares anymore . 
  thatcher and merkel have probably only in common that they are/were both women in power . 
  as long as the sample is truly random , it can be actually quite representative , the number alone doesn not mean that much without context on how and who they asked , so it can be trusted in my opinion . 
  oh , its polish . 
  welp okay point in case , we do n't even know the polish in any other way then that . 
  yes , its definitely germany that humiliated greece .

  we are obviously living in paralell dimensions somehow . 
  germany objected greece entering the euro , we gave in , we objected giving them bailouts ( because thats exactly what the eu treaties say ) , then we gave in , now greece made an spectacular unfair referendum ( because peoples will or something ) and threw a fit like a kid , and we wanted to kick them out of the euro for that after 5 years of constantly accusing us of being nazis ( because that is by the way the opinion of the [ german population ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/12547/chart_grexit_juni_verlauf-neu.png ) ) and then we are forced to give in again and then you accuse us of being the side who doesnt care ? 
  countries like france and greece only invoke solidarity if they want something without giving anything in return . 
  this is a huge blackmail operation and nothing else , but hey now greece got their next bailout despite not deserving it , i bet it will last about 6 to 12 months until everything is our fault again . 
  its definitely nice to be surrounded by blackmailing ` friends ' and ` allies ' . 
  i hope germany will be less cooperative in the future . 
  where , when and what exactly did she say ? 
  all i see is a made-up headline of an online article or is this just another of tsipras lies ? 
  there is no quote in the whole article . 
  you already said oxi to europe , now its our turn to return the favor . 
  now we are to blame again , he ? 
  atleast everyone found a way to feel superior . 
  its shit like this why i believe more and more that germany should leave the euro and watch the fire from far away . 
  solidarity is n't a one-way street in which you can demand more and more . 
  for the last 40 years germany always backed down and i am tired of it . 
  we should have never meddled in greece to begin with , just let them kill themselfes . 
  i hope our fin . 
  min . 
  does his job and protects us . 
  they alone , but dont forget coalitions of small countries . 
  and here comes the bullshit part , every reform in the right direction would have been welcomed because the lenders were not out to get greece despite the speeches of the greek government . 
  they can make a referendum that makes no sense to piss of everyone but some small reforms are suddenly too much ? 
  they have an independent government , stop putting the blame anywhere but to greece . 
  as long as there are no tanks and soldiers of foreign nations on the streets of athen , its greece 's decisions and its also their fault . 
  proposed but once again not implemented . 
  so let us not do the mistakes of the past 5 years and instead make the mistakes of the last 30 years , more spending with foreign money and no consequences whatsoever , yeaaaah . 
  daily reminder : if the left says something its the peoples will and democracy , if the right voices an opinion its baseless propaganda and fascism . 
  that is the glaring inefficiency of the system , too many people that do n't do much at all . 
  a lying greek government , well i 'd never ... 
  you monster , i bet you littered once , too , and immediately regretted it , but did not pick it up . 
  http://www.pt-magazin.de/uploads/pics/reichstag_christo.jpg as it turns out that draws even more people to the very building . 
  germany post ww2 ? 
  alright , i just hope we get a nice coastline as occupation zone , also athen is now divided between russia france usa and britain . 
  well , they actually grew the last few quarters though . 
  it would have been possible . 
  greece has a huge untouched military etat , it would have been possible and with growth and inflation the gdp/debt ratio would have become bearable in a few years . 
  and the worst thing ? 
  greece was on a slow but right path . 
  why yes , you should n't actually trust a country who voted someone like hitler into power for atleast 20 years . 
  do n't forget the natural gas . 
  so do we have yet another enemy in the eu that wants to kick the germans ? 
  or what does this mean now ? 
  soso , i fell for the propaganda . 
  you see there is the mistake in your thought , i know very well what i want and what not and i care about my eating habits a lot more than about taxing some rich people or energy saving . 
  i 'd rather continue destroying the planet ( which is n't a binary choice in the first place , but i do n't want to disturb your simple world view ) . 
  this is the reason why i do n't vote green , despite having some similar opinions . 
  the greens compromize the goals they themself call more important with stuff like veggie day . 
  i definitely do not let a political party decide what i can eat . 
  then i can just vote for the fascists . 
  but hey if the greens let themselfes get compromised by nonsense its on them . 
  same thing happened with the pirate party , idiocy does n't fly with the electorate . 
  yeah that is about right , there will be absolutely no reforms whatsoever with the conservatives in power since the socialists and the liberals decided power is more important than social progression and liberty . 
  we have a majority for gay marriage since many years now , just the coaliton partner in question then blocks everything and votes with the conservatives . 
  no you did n't . 
   i do n't really like the gdp per capita  it 's not really telling the whole story . 
  continues to compare gdp with gdp ppp per capita with saying that gdp ppp per capita is telling more of the story  i do n't feel gdp per capita is the best measurement you arbitrarily changed the measurements in one sentence to the next . 
  your first chart is not gdp per capita , its only gdp , so your argument doesnt make much sense . 
  to be fair , spain bounces back currently , peaked at 26.3 ( march 2013 ) and is in decline since then with 23 % ( march 2015 ) . 
  i 'd say if the government now presses onward with reforms we could see a continuation of that . 
  actually most piigs states except italy are improving currently .

  one day russia , too , will culturally advance enough to live peaceful with its neighbours , but certainly not in this generation . 
  germany certainly did not lose with the end of nazism . 
  for those being ` liberated ' by the sowjets its just extremely cynical . 
  just got out of the fascists grip right into the red hell . 
  but hey , stalin did nothing wrong , yk . 
  they seem to included everything in there , including the victims of the sowjet regime . 
  most western countries have remembrance days now for the victims of ww2 and not martial victory parades to show off how big and mighty you are . 
  i have the same problem with the german anthem , its boring , the only thing i can imagine to our anthem is old fat grey people with no personality and ideas somewhere from the 1960 's like [ this ] ( http://www.berlin-lese.de/files_berlin_lese/helmutkohl01.jpg ), 
  well , if your country has nothing you can atleast sun yourself in past victories . 
  funnily enough the german press notice has slowakei in there . 
  we can seize some of the shiny tactical nukes of the americans still hid away in some bunkers in west germany . 
  another distraction to the fact that they actually have a time machine .
