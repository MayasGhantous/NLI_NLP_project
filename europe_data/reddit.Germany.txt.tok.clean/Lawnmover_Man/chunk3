  seems like they would be really happy if you come over . 
  -- well ... 
  i can understand how you must feel , hearing all those stuff about germany , seeing things in the news and on pictures . 
  i can definitely understand how disappointed a refugee must be , coming down to reality and see that things are not * that * good in germany . 
  and that germany ca n't put thousands of people per day in nice houses `` filled with food and toys '' . 
  germany is not that dream that some refugees had in their minds . 
  but it was germany that fueled this dreams even further in the last time . 
   fearmongering i actually do n't know what fear mongering you mean ? 
  i do n't see anything like that in the article . 
  genuine question . 
  while that is true , this creates the problem of cultural isolation . 
  i think it is best to spread all immigrants most widely . 
   research shows these people will generally adapt to western culture would you mind linking to studies/research about that topic ? 
  genuinely interested . 
  yeah . 
  you seem like a pretty calm dude who can discuss opinions and viewpoints while staying on topic . 
  you are obviously able to avoid misinterpreting people by assuming less and talking more . 
  you do n't just label people and insult them . 
  it 's just that other people are often assholes , right ? 
  they just are . 
  how can they not see it ? 
  it is kinda sad that you are so ultimately sure of your interpretations . 
  you are seeing so `` clear '' . 
  for you so many things are `` obvious '' . 
  it seems you ca n't be wrong . 
  you are labeling his experiences as `` excuses '' . 
  you label his opinion as `` useless wrong generalization '' . 
  and `` of course '' you call bullshit on him - as if this were `` of course '' common sense to do that and every sane being would do it . 
  * you * are doing that . 
  for you , there is no way you could have just understood him wrong . 
  i get the feeling that it seems impossible to you that an opinion that differs from yours is still an educated and well thought one . 
  regarding `` anecdotes are pointless '' because they might be wrong or a deception and are not verifiable : this is a `` knockout argument '' . 
  if you really believe in this , can you please tell me what `` objective evidence '' you would accept in this complex matter ? 
  how can anyone discuss anything with you , when you dispute everything a person `` claims '' to be `` pointless anecdotes '' . 
  are we supposed to carry around perfect and flawless evidence for everything we say in order to take part in a discussion ? 
  i 'm speechless . 
  you are virtuously bending words and grammar to your liking . 
  i 'm fairly sure you actually know what i * mean * . 
   nobody accused him of being racist what ... ? 
   peterchen87 said :  `` you probably are in fact a ` racist shitbag ' ''  you said :  `` this is why you 're called a bigot when you do shit like that . '', 
  nobody was calling him a racist ? 
  while that is ( again ) technically true ... well ...  discussions and arguments are only meaningful if you can bring objective evidence to support your ideas . 
  you can tell anecdotes and share stories , but you can not use them as evidence of something . 
  i really wonder what proper `` objective evidence '' would look like for you . 
  please remember this is not a scientific topic , but a human one . 
  numbers are important , but there is more to it . 
  please consider this . 
  for me , it is like this : a word from a person which has no personal experience whatsoever about a topic * does * have a meaning to me . 
  it would be stupid to discard their thoughts , just because their life did n't include direct events similar to the topic . 
  they still can have a opinion about a topic . 
  but a word from a person that had experience with the topic in his life and can therefore give first hand stories about that ... for me their thoughts and opinions have more `` weight '' . 
  of course i do n't `` copy '' their opinion immediately . 
  but i rather have their stories alongside their opinions , so that i can see where they 're coming from . 
  then there is no point in discussion . 
  because anything can be a lie , a deception , or anything . 
  no one knows . 
  is anyone really not racist ... or vegan ... or pacifist ... ? 
  if i tell you : `` hey , i was a nurse for * doctors without borders * for ten years . 
  i care about human well-being . '', 
  following your logic you might answer : `` that does not convince me of your alleged intentions !, 
  it still is possible that you only did it because you maybe wanted to impress a women !, 
  i think you might still do n't give a shit about human well-being ! '', 
  think about it . 
  this is literally what you are doing . 
  well , technically you are right . 
  but then again , we do n't know anything for sure , because we can not see inside ones head . 
  therefore the term `` racist shitbag '' may apply to you as well . 
  there is no way for me to be sure , and you are not able to dispute it . 
  with that logic , you can put an end to any discussion about any topic . 
  but that 's not helping anyone . 
   we should discontinue to believe that every refugee is a human rights activist . 
  that is spot on . 
  this is the vibe i got from germany from the start : `` every refugee is nice , lovable , educated ! '', 
  no , they 're not . 
  why ? 
  because they 're humans , too . 
  and humans are assholes . 
  assholes come in great variety : german assholes , syrian assholes , russian assholes ... and so on . 
  but here is the thing : wether asshole or not . 
  humans deserve freedom , security and shelter . 
  `` even '' assholes . 
  i do n't want any asshole to suffer . 
  but i have to be aware , that some are so much of an asshole , that * they want * others to suffer . 
  and then some of them are actively taking action to let others suffer . 
  and ** those ** are not welcome . 
  and they should be openly told this and kicked out . 
   marrying black people does n't make one less of a racist . 
  do n't you think you are stretching things a little bit ? 
  do you want to say that it does n't say anything , if a marriage is of mixed race ? 
  both spouses can still be racist ? 
   no offence . 
  just saying . 
  dude ... really ? 
  what you did is absolutely not `` just saying '' . 
  what you did is rather an example of what he meant . 
  they can also just send two messages . 
  * a ) encrypted for the original recipient * b ) encrypted for decryption on the whatsapp server all we see ist just some data flowing around , all being encrypted . 
  it 's so ridiculously simple to work around all this , when you have a closed source client . 
   there is n't a good reason to think that whatsapp is not one of the most secure chat systems in existence . 
  there is a good reason to think that : it is not open source .
