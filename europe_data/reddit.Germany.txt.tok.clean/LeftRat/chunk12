  germany here : the military itself , as a whole , is seen as a necessary evil to some degree . 
  germans are extremely wary of overextending outside of what they feel is absolutely necessary . 
  they are definitely seen as a defensive force first and foremost . 
  * soldiers * , at least the `` lowly '' grunts , are seen as lazy drunkards who could n't get anything else . 
  the bundeswehr has desperately tried to get rid of that notion , and ever since the draft ended , public perception of soldiers is getting better . 
  we 've had this question about a million times now . 
  it 's getting a little bit tiring . 
  hungary . 
  we did it every year when i was very young . 
  i know all the stories , but the earliest actual memories i have are a. 
  sitting in the back of the car at night , on our way there . 
  i loved just watching lights pass by . 
  buying something from a kiosk , forgettint the change and running back to get it . 
  the sandy beach , the kiosk , the stone in front of it - that somehow stuck around in my memory . 
  otherwise , those early trips there are gone . 
  hey , better to stay safe . 
  totally understandable . 
  except that 's the fact in all countries . 
  if we exclude the , let 's say , five biggest crime centers in america you would also have to exclude the five biggest crime centers in the countries you are comparing it to . 
  in the end , these crime centers are part of america , and the fact that * they exist * is indicative of a problem - one that way too many americans on reddit like to be blind to by saying `` well it 's just these places '' . 
  again , it 's like excluding beaches from a statistic on drowning : taking them out makes the statistic borderline useless . 
  * da wird doch der hund in der pfanne verr\u00fcckt * - `` the dog goes crazy in the pan '' , meaning that something is maddening . 
  * das ist doch zum m\u00e4usemelken * - `` it 's like milking mice '' , similarly saying that something is frustrating . 
  * mit [ x ] ist nicht gut kirschenessen * - `` it 's not good cherry-eating with [ x ] '' , meaning that someone is not easy to deal with or is very strict . 
  * das ist nicht das gelbe vom ei * - `` it 's not the egg 's yolk '' , meaning it 's sub-par . 
  * - `` so this is the poodle 's core !, 
  '' , not used commonly nowerdays , it means that you have found the truth about something . 
  it 's a reference to goethe 's faust , where mephistopheles disguises himself as a poodle . 
  i mean , first of all , he is really wrong : while germans ( generalising here , of course ) dislike what the american * government * does and like to make uneducated `` it 's america 's fault '' comments , germans do appreciate some parts of the american influence on our country , and germans absolutely adore * americans * that come over here . 
  i mean , yeah , it really depends on what you view as `` default safety '' . 
  europe , especially germany , is pretty much `` default western society safety '' . 
  oookay , i know everyone else is already beating on you , so i 'll try to calmly go through this . 
  `` it 's about how they are killing your economies '' - they really are n't , and even if they were , that would take a long time . 
  your travel safety is not going to be impacted by that . 
  `` followed by the increase in terror attacks . '', 
  which is still so far below anything else that it 's laughable to be worried about . 
  seriously , it might very well be more likely to be killed by lightening . 
  c. `` but that 's mostly because of a few dense urban centers '' - i keep hearing that argument by americans , but that 's a really bad excuse . 
  the majority of crime happens in dense urban centers , no matter where you look . 
  sure , if you cut out those trouble-spots , the us would have a much more average crime-rate - but you 'd have to do the same for every other country , too . 
  you ca n't compare `` rural , safe us town '' to `` berlin kreuzberg '' . 
  it 's kinda like saying `` if we just take away all beaches from this statistic on drowning , it looks much better '' . 
  really , they 're about the same . 
  both russian and northern african immigrants very quickly established themselves in organised crime , but of course the one that is happening at the moment always seems worse . 
  i do n't see much of a difference in the problems they cause or the severity of it - crime , a bit of cultural clash , the `` clumping together '' in separate communities , the general problems with bureaucracy - all this seems about as problematic . 
  i do want to clarify that my tone is not meant to imply that these are `` huge '' , insurmountable problems . 
  they are problems without clear cut solutions , though . 
  edit : reading the other replies , i should clarify that i 'm talking post 1990 , as i am too young to have any other experiences . 
  `` sprudel '' is regionally used either for fizzy water or generally all fizzy drinks , like your `` ranja '' example . 
  `` limonade '' can mean both fizzy fruit-drinks or traditional lemonade . 
  i 'm sure someone more knowledgeable could add some more examples or clarify , i am sure there are more distinctions to be made . 
  that 's oversimplifying it a bit . 
  there * are * legally binding referendums in germany : for changing the constitution and to change the territory of the bundesl\u00e4nder . 
  also , other types of binding referendums are not * illegal * - there is just no law in place and no space within the system to allow for them , although that 's a nitpick . 
  of course , non-binding referendums are completely fine . 
  it 's the nation 's own business if they want to have a referendum . 
  the eu does n't really have the right - and no real incentive - to require a referendum . 
  i mean , that 's totally a good thing . 
  if a nation decides it no longer wants to be part of the eu , who are we to keep them in ? 
  and how would we enforce it ? 
  these are sovereign nations - and they remain sovereign throughout their membership . 
  also , it 's only easy to leave on the legal side of things - the economic and political complications are huge , as the uk can attest to . 
  i 'm not saying it makes much sense . 
  it 's simply a gradient - the `` we have this stuff for some reason '' - stuff discounters have is n't really an issue , because they make up a small part of the inventory : you can still easily tell what the store in question `` normally '' sells . 
  with walmart , that was n't possible . 
  that one always baffled me , since he had a basically decent approach to his speech : `` we made jewellery that is n't a luxury , that the common man can buy '' . 
  a child could have written a basic , positive speech from that . 
  but instead , he just keeps putting references to poor quality in there . 
  to elaborate on this : walmart was just the perfect storm all around . 
  every part of it clashes . 
  a : established discounters already existed , meaning they were trying to wrestle their way into a very competitive , entrenched market . 
  b : germans do n't like buying everything in the same store . 
  we like specialised stores . 
  if our grocery shop sells tires and belts , they may get away with it , but the larger it gets the more it will turn us away . 
  c : as you said , they tried to pull the whole `` almost religious chanting every morning to be happy '' bullshit , which really does n't work over here . 
  and they also tried all their dirty anti-worker tactics , which does not go over well here . 
  d : their locations were poorly chosen - many of their stores were only accessible by car . 
  in a country that desperately wants to go green and where many , especially younger citizens do n't feel the need to have a car , you 're cutting off part of your demographic by setting up shop so far away from any public transportation . 
  they tried their `` one size fits all '' approach and miserably failed . 
  i remember my father was one of the workers doing the electrical stuff in those stores , and just months afterwards he had to go back to the same locations since walmart had sold everything and had given up . 
  that 's a very good summary of it , spot on . 
  in a professional setting in germany , it is last names only - until one of them feels comfortable enough to offer something else ( which happens almost never in conservative companies , but much quicker in `` hip '' businesses , very much attuned to the average age of employees ) . 
  so absolutely go with the mr. [ lastname ] format , you 're doing it exactly right . 
  it 's completely fine . 
  old people and cynical hipsters may look at it a bit funny , but other than that , everything is good . 
  it 's definitely not banned - in fact , you can buy them at any knick-knack store and at every tourist location . 
  paris airport , however , i ca n't tell you about . 
  i assume you can have it in your carry bag , but i 'd ask just to be sure . 
  my girlfriend loves gronkh , a famous german youtuber . 
  let 's plays and the like - a bit less screamy than pewdiepie , but not especially high-brow , either . 
  so like yogscast or jesse cox . 
  the posts are okay . 
  not as bad as r/europe , though . 
  adding to this : you then reply with `` danke '' , `` thank you '' . 
  if someone continues to sneeze , many will jokingly wish other things than `` health '' upon you , often continuing to get more jokingly mean the more you sneeze . 
  hey , we germans also do that with `` prost '' , interesting !, 
  adding to this , a sort of fictional ( but not really ) example is `` buxtehude '' - comparing or mentioning something to it means `` this place is in the middle of nowhere and unimportant '' . 
  pretty much the title . 
  bonus points if you can make a joke you have to know * two * languages for !, 
  wikiremax was very clearly talking about trump supporters .
