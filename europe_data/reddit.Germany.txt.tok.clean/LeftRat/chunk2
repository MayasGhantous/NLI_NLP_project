  not necessarily the * biggest * , but probably some of the most fervent . 
  i can see how a chinese historian may come to that conclusion , considering their history . 
  as an idealist , though - nah . 
  unity and power are not worth throwing millions upon millions of lives away . 
  eh , whatever . 
  continents are badly defined and it really does n't matter if someone thinks europe is n't one . 
  italy . 
  it was a class trip with my school . 
  the little bungalows ( actually `` beached '' tiny trailers ) were shit , the tap water was undrinkable and the nearest store ages away , we only visited touristy places so all the usual complaints apply - we did n't even go to museums or anything educational besides a short tour through one random city . 
  also , a drugged up guy broke into one of the trailers and almost stabbed a few people with a knife , which terrified the people involved and very much ruined the trip . 
  the architecture in the older cities was nice , though . 
  so overall , not really italy 's fault , just bad planning and bad luck . 
  erm ... well ... last year i went to a harry potter larp in a castle . 
  it was pretty great . 
  we had a small castle all for ouselves . 
  hell , we even managed to have the gryffindor and ravenclaw bedrooms in the towers and the hufflepuff one close to the kitchen . 
  1 ) no thanks . 
  not a single inch should be given to bigotry . 
  2 ) wholeheartedly agree with everything but the last sentence . 
  capitalism is not in power because it 's pragmatic or efficient . 
  yes , i 'm a stereotypical socialist . 
  3 ) ideally family businesses would also not be preferred - petit bourgeoisie is still bourgeoisie . 
  far better than the alternative , though , so absolutely yes . 
  6 ) nope . 
  it should be based on nothing . 
  they want to come , let them come - no limits , no willingness to assimilate . 
  i 'm on my phone so i ca n't type out detailed responses to 4 and 5 right now . 
  it was supposed to be a short summary , so i did n't mention everything . 
  although i find the whole `` heir of the sed '' thing to be utterly ridiculous , considering no other party gets shit for their past transgressions or those of their predecessor party . 
  right off the bat : i am a democratic hardcore socialist and that 's how my descriptions are coloured . 
  ** spd ** : nominally social democrats , but have seriously slipped on the `` social '' part for a while . 
  popular with lower-middle-class and those that simply have always voted for them and do n't want to really consider anything more radical . 
  ** cdu/csu : ** christian conservatives . 
  bavaria overwhelmingly votes for them ( technically , their csu is distinct from the national cdu and often even more to the right ) . 
  merkel 's party , although she is far more liberal than most of the cdu voting base . 
  who votes for them ? 
  the old , the well-off and , well , moderate right-wingers . 
  ** alliance 90/the greens : ** started as your typical hippie eco-party , by now they 're basically liberals catering to the upper-middle class . 
  oftentimes termed '' [ x ] with a conscience '' , x being whatever party they are most like for the moment . 
  ** fdp : ** free market capitalists . 
  they ... have not fared well . 
  running `` it 's the poor 's own fault '' campaigns during economic depression does n't work well , as it turns out . 
  they 're socially liberal and try to market that . 
  their voters are the children of the rich and wealthy , some educated libertarians ( in the american `` free market is king '' sense ) , some middle-class with hopes of getting rich , etc. 
  basically the `` alt-right '' come to life as a party . 
  a lot of nationalism and racism re-packaged as isolationism and dog-whistles out the wazoo . 
  literally outraged about a black kid being featured on a chocolate package . 
  ambivalent when it comes to economy , because let 's be honest , they do n't know what the fuck they 're doing with that , that 's not what they care about . 
  their voters are exactly what you expect , plus a bunch of centrist opportunists that either did n't get the memo about those dog-whistles or just do n't care . 
  ** die linke ** : a left party , literally . 
  pushing generally for a more social democracy , they are having a lot of problems marketing themselves or projecting unity . 
  their voters are those that want the economy to push further left and feel disappointed by spd centrism . 
  for a left party they get surprisingly few working class voters , owing to their inability to get some pr work done . 
  spd and cdu normally are the big winners , while everyone else resorts ro being kingmakers or opposition . 
  well a guy with your username should know !, 
  what is it with shitty bots lately ? 
  i mean , even * here * - a sub that takes a harder stance against that kind of bigotry - you still get the occasional `` let 's shit on the travelling people '' thread . 
  it 's far too accepted to hate them , always with the excuse of `` just saying that 's what i 've seen '' . 
  hey , they were n't saying there was n't a lot of criticism for him , they said he was generally well-liked . 
  the normal population absolutely liked obama . 
  the normal population did n't exactl know about his merciless drone strikes and did n't care about his failure to close guantanamo bay . 
  i support them in the sense that out of all the major parties , i want them to win - but they are n't socialists for the most part . 
  they wo n't start giving workers actual control of their labour aaaanytime soon . 
  that 's a popular tourist scam basically everwhere . 
  it 's relying on people 's aversion to conflict . 
  it 's just so much more refreshing !, 
  i love it . 
  the more bubbles , the better . 
  ah , no matter how far we come when it comes to bigotry , there will always be the `` let 's shit on gypsies '' threads . 
  not really , it 's more about class and age for me . 
  the absolute classic for crisps here is `` hungarian '' / paprika flavour . 
  other than that , salted and peperoni , i think , are the big ones . 
  companies are really trying to find some new flavour trends , but most of those end up as really limited runs that just do n't taste that great - currywurst , pizza flavour , just weird stuff . 
  yeah , just a few days ago an undetonated bomb was found right where my girlfriend lives ... 
  north germany , somewhere by the sea . 
  i really love it there . 
  the air is just so much better . 
  i 'm probably the odd one out ( although looking through the comments , the other germans here seem to like odd small idealist parties ) - i 'm a straight up democratic socialist . 
  not much choice for me . 
  i disagree with some core tenets of both the marxistisch-leninistischen partei ( mlpd ) and the deutsche kommunistische partei ( dkp ) , since both of them are very ... let 's say `` old-school '' . 
  these two are already very small . 
  i guess the mlpd is closest , but i would n't count myself as an open supporter , especially since they officially defend fucking stalin . 
  major parties : afd , `` alternative f\u00fcr deutschland '' ( alternative for germany ) . 
  they 're thinly veiled alt-right/neo-nazis . 
  it 's genuinely frightening how close they can get to outright saying `` black people are evil '' without people catching on ( see the kinderschokolade debacle ) . 
  that was n't even necessary i feel . 
  since the rise of the afd they 've been bleeding members and exposure to them . 
  it really depends . 
  i think it is certainly okay to ask - no shame in that , and no shame for having an adventurous love-life . 
  but i 'd certainly not ask every fling off tinder to bring a full report card before engaging . 
  eh , sorry , i do n't know anything about military ranks and thought i remembered that there was an english translation of the hauptmann deutschland stuff that called him that . 
  funnily enough , marvel tried to make a german captain america for a while . 
  named him `` hauptmann deutschland '' - seargent germany . 
  that sounds ... really damn bad . 
  the military title combined with the country name just invokes a certain nationalism in that case , and the hero was quickly dropped . 
  it should be noted that this is also blatant favouritism - many religions ca n't just levy their tax through the state . 
  also , it costs money to leave the church , which is just blatantly wrong considering most church members were entered by their parents before they could consent . 
  i think i 'd rather be wiped out than siding with genocidal maniacs . 
  then again , i am german , who knows who i would have been back then . 
  if it 's a good question , sure !,
