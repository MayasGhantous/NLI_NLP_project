  unfortunately , very little is done to actively campaign for legalization around here . 
  it 's not seen as an important issue . 
  never . 
  i could - my region has a long marksman 's club tradition , but i dislike the culture that comes with it and probably would n't enjoy anything but the novelty , anyway . 
  of the people i know , nobody has shot one besides one guy who 's a hunter , one guy who 's in an old school marksman 's club and my father , who 's in the police . 
  however , then you have people in the populated countries saying they 're being overruled by the needs of a few . 
  i think it was pispers that said `` you can take one of those neo-nazi youths and walk with them through their town in mecklenburg-vorpommern and not see a single foreigner for days , but in his mind there are still too many '' . 
  `` schere-stein-papier '' - scissors , stone , paper . 
  but we also say `` schnick-schnack-schnuck '' . 
  there is a popular fourth sign in germany , `` brunnen '' - the well . 
  it beats stone and scissors and is only beaten by paper . 
  in itself it is obviously unfair , but it 's actual value comes from the fact that someone can say `` no well '' beforehand and thus disqualify it . 
  either it is disqualified or you can gain a maddening victory your friends are going to hate you for by using well and pointing out nobody disqualified it beforehand . 
  but then you run the risk of them deliberately not disqualifying it so they can throw paper and win - an unfair sign is n't worth much if everyone knows you will do it . 
  to add to that : they were under surveillance from the * verfassungsschutz * , the `` protectors of the constitution '' ( wow that sounds way more pompous in english ) long before being banned . 
  the state figured pretty early on that these guys were systematically undermining any democracy they set foot in . 
  i 'll seperate this into `` the draft '' and `` the military '' , because the two are viewed differently . 
  ** before the draft ended ** , to a certain point , it was ridiculed for being a waste of money : germany does n't need a large standing army , we 're surrounded by allies and the future of warfare for western countries does not lie with big ground armies . 
  it was repeatedly called out for basically just training people to binge-drink and be idiots . 
  it was also seen as troubling by the political left ( because the state is taking all young men and teaching them to obey orders and kill on command ) and mostly as a `` coming of age '' experience by everyone else - the drinking , the pranks , the physical exertion . 
  the criticisms of its influence on culture , however , was tempered by the fact that there was an alternative : draftees could sign up for an alternative draft that put you in a social project , like a home for the elderly or a hospital , to help out . 
  german social institutions are now sorely missing those `` zivis '' , but has adapted to it since then . 
  ** the armed forces themselves ** are viewed as a necessery evil : it 's okay if you join them , it 's a job like any other , you get paid for your increased risk and you have extra responsibilities , but they are n't looked at as `` better '' or worthy of veneration . 
  the educational opportunities they offer are great ( they have to really sweeten the deal nowerdays to get the best ) , but that 's about it . 
  i think we have a pretty healthy attitude towards the military , but hey , i get featured on r/shiteuropeanssay , so i guess i probably just think that because i hate america or something . 
  new arrivals have reduced in rate but are still happening . 
  refugees are settling in , many still living in shelters , though . 
  the stituation is n't dire anymore , though , the infrastructure has finally caught up to make civilian help unnecessary for the most part , which is a relief ( many volunteers burned out quickly during the initial rush ) . 
  i do n't know any , personally , that have left the country . 
  basically , yes . 
  `` luxury treatments '' and really expensive ones still require you to pay , depending on your insurance . 
  i think the unconditional basic income is too far away to really consider this . 
  but overall , yes , i suppose i would . 
  not pro-capitalism , but useful and lucrative for us capitalists . 
  unfortunately , he is often glossed over in german history classes , which makes most people 's knowledge of him very basic . 
  i do n't think they have much moral judgement for him . 
  option one : not going to happen . 
  germany , for example , just got rid of conscription and restructured its entire military because of it . 
  option two : i mean , they already get paid really well and have incredible educational opportunities , i do n't think you can put much on top of that to efficiently get more people into it . 
  option three : not going to happen . 
  the members that are already against a eu military would completely lose their shit , together with a fair few other countries . 
  in the end , i do n't think a eu military will actually be formed unless the us actually pulls out of nato , which i doubt they will : despite their constant complains that the others are n't paying their due , nato is primarily still serving american interests . 
  huh , odd . 
  germany has basically none of that ( which i am glad for ) , aside from maybe some online retailers getting in on it . 
  maybe you could have , you know , looked at similar questions on this sub . 
  of which there are many . 
  most of which get downvoted because people are tired of the same question . 
  learn to read the room a little . 
  you asked for my opinion . 
  you got it . 
  yeah , just read his post history . 
  he even thinks belgium is `` a hellhole '' because `` teh muslims '' . 
  ... did you seriously just blame american atrocities ... because they were european at the time ? 
  i mean , if that ` st he case , you also ca n't blame germany for genocide . 
  that was the third reich , we 're just a successor state . 
  you absolutely killed millions . 
  just think of the dozens of dictators you supported , brought into power , helped putsch their way into government . 
  add the genocide , the asian internment camps , atrocities and minor wars . 
   if the u.s. were n't spending billions protecting europe you would have either been overran by russia/soviet union or descended into another world war . 
  modern russia does n't give two shits about `` taking europe '' - you 're not here to defend us , you 're here for yourself . 
  you can stop with your `` gracious defender '' facade . 
  `` another world war '' ah yes , europe just starts world wars for shits and giggles unless our benevolent benefactor is watching . 
  you have no sense for history . 
   americans are not conformists , it is against american culture . 
  bahahahaha  european politics is just an echochamber full of politicians repeating what they like to hear , and dissenters too scared to offer alternative views in case they 'd be arrested , harassed or be deemed politically incorrect . 
  my god my sides  we had two political candidates that could n't be more different this election : clinton and trump . 
  we had libertarians making big strides too . 
  in europe it 's all just one variation of leftist-inspired statism . 
  it 's like you ca n't even read !, 
  you can go now . 
  you 're either a troll or seriously not capable of understanding , so i see no point other than my own amusement . 
  this is r/askeurope , not r/asksaltyamericansthatcan ` ttakecriticism . 
  norway is just great . 
  such beautiful nature . 
  i just ca n't wrap my head around how pretty it oftentimes is . 
  and here we go again !, 
   after all , we started , at least , two major world wars , if we can bring this one up , we can bring up anything : your genocide of native americans , slavery etc. 
  - i mean , that 's idiotic and unfair since the people alive right now have zero to do with it , but if you do it , you have to look in the mirror , too . 
   supported numerous dictators that killed hundreds of millions of people , actually , yeah , america * did * support numerous dictators that have killed millions . 
  in fact , `` supporting dictators '' is probably what america has done best . 
  and that 's not some far-off historical fact , they literally did that during my entire lifetime and the lifetime of my parents , all over the world . 
   grew actual empires on the backs of the third world oh yeah , really got me there . 
  installing brutal dictators and fascists in any country you can get your hands on , then exploiting the fuck out of their economy while basically holding their industry hostage - that 's totally different !, 
   you still have to coddle us by providing billions for our defense oh man , that old myth again !, 
  first of all , european nations spend a pretty reasonsable part of their budget on defense , considering we have a combined military bigger than russia . 
  secondly , let 's not act as if the money the us spends is some generous gift : you spend it to gain military might and influence . 
  this is n't philantropy driving you to protect your `` allies '' : you do it because you want to be top dog . 
  acting as if it was somehow * our * fault that * you * have an insane urge to dominate literally any engagement by having a ten-times as large force is truly ridiculous . 
  you want your bases for starting drones in germany , because you need them for all your middle-eastern warfare ? 
  well then pay for it , because we sure are n't getting anything out of it otherwise . 
  or pull out of nato like you 've been threatening forever . 
   as an outsider , i 'm fascinated by the lack of real diversity of political opinion in europe . 
  they are all various shades of leftist-inspired statism . oooookay . 
  sure . 
  you know , the place where actual multi-party systems exist and basically every country has a free-market party , a green party , a socialist party , a christian party ... that 's of course the place that lacks political diversity . 
  and that 's coming from * america * of all places . 
  literally the only thing you could say is that the general mainstream politics , in comparison with the us , is shifted to the left ( and even that depends heavily on the nation in question ) , to which i can say : you could say the same about the us , except replace `` left '' with `` right '' . 
  edit : not to mention your arrogant little speech came about * because you just ca n't stand * the fact that someone might dislike america and might be bored and annoyed by the constant barrage of `` well what do you think about us , though '' questions here . 
  it 's like you 're deliberately trying to prove my point about americans in this sub oftentimes being completely focused on making it about their country . 
  mostly i 'm tired of americans coming to this sub and just constantly making things about themselves .
