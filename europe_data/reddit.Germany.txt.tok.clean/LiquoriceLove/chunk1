so you 're saying the hard-working people of countries like germany , denmark and finland should hand-over part of their own money to some lazy good-for-nothings ? 
  what kind of mindset do you have ??? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  it is my tax money . 
  my country is paying the bills for all these lazy countries that ca n't get their act together . 
  it 's not fair that germany , denmark , finland etc. 
  should pay everything for everyone . 
  eu sucks . 
  i 'm tired of greece and all the other slackers not paying back my money . 
  that s good to hear , although i 'm a bit surprised . 
  with ireland being catholic and all i would have expected a more conservative outcome . 
  it 's also the best way to fight wars , too . 
  says the german militarist . 
  what * very real threat * are we talking about btw ? 
  it is worrying to see that my country 's hunger for military action is on the rise again . 
  i find it highly dubious how my country is happily selling tanks to countries such as saudi-arabia or qatar so that they can use them to support their draconian dictatorships . 
  hello my friend , good for you !, 
  i hope you had a good time over here  i do n't think free movement of people is a problem as long as the involved countries roughly have the same standard of living . 
  i do think it 's a problem though , when you have very poor countries on the one hand and rather * rich * countries on the other like we have in the eu . 
  it should be up to the individual countries , not the eu as a whole , to work out bilateral agreements on this . 
  yes but they are mostly people who who spend their retirement abroad and bring their live savings with them . 
  so that is entirely different from the massive influx of labour migrants that we are seeing in germany , the uk and northern europe . 
  luckily , the current french government will be gone soon enough so it does n't really matter . 
  i 'm not particularly fond of a sarkozy comeback but still better than that useless holande guy . 
  another 5 years and we may see marine le pen emerge as president of france which would be great !, 
  hello man , what are you talking about ? 
  i care about my country that is all and you should too . 
  why do n't you help build up your country so that it can be great , too ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  do n't you feel any commitment ? 
  the german public are sheep , ready to swallow whatever the government and media feed them . 
  yes . 
  letting in the turks in in the 1960s was a mistake but it 's too late to do anything about it because they have been here for decades so we just have to deal with them . 
  * the free movement of people is by far the greatest problem and must be abolished * ditch the euro and return to national currencies i envy the brits , at least they will have an in/out referendum ... even though i doubt it will be a fair one . 
  i wish we would have one in germany . 
  well yes the world is an unfair place but that 's just how it is . 
  get over it . 
  also we are a very disciplined and hard-working people and always have been so i guess that explains why we are comparatively well off . 
  they 're not crucial to the interests of my people , thank you . 
  why not let each nation decide on what they want or do n't want . 
  we are sovereign countries . 
  i want no say in romanian affairs and i do n't want romanians to have a say in german affairs either . 
  let 's be friends but that should be as far as it goes . 
  i do n't want to share my bed with you or anybody else for that matter , thank you very much . 
  schr\u00f6der is to germany what blair is to the uk . 
  a liar and a traitor . 
  please , you can have him if you want . 
  you brought this up . 
  i already said i do n't care whether you are from romania or ireland or switzerland or any other place . 
  all i am saying is that foreigners should not be allowed to vote in national parliamentary elections . 
  if you are a naturalized german citizen , obviously you are not a foreigner and you can calm down again . 
  obviously you * do n't * have the same rights as i unless you are a german citizen . 
  and rightly so , it would be ridiculous if foreign nationals were allowed to vote in general elections , for instance . 
  and that holds true for * any * country in the world . 
  i certainly would n't expect to be allowed to vote in romanian national elections just because i happened to live there . 
  i do n't mind you living in my country but it 's not * your * country unless you have a german passport . 
  you should n't make broad generalizations based on your personal experience though . 
  * rolleyes *, 
  i did n't act superior , i simply said that romania is not ready to be part of the eu , let alone the common currency union . 
  if you take that personally , frankly it 's not my problem . 
  also i do n't care whether you live in my country or not , why would i ? 
  i have no reason to doubt that you and your family are nice people . 
  you should however watch your manners and not forget that , after all , you are the guest in my country . 
  not the other way around . 
  yes some of what you are saying is true . 
  however it 's not like germany or the uk ** need ** cheap foreign labour to survive . 
  it 's more that corporations and business ** want ** cheap migrant workers so they can get away with paying low wages . 
  but i ask you is that in the interest of german or british citizens ? 
  i say no . 
  tackling mass eu poverty migration would put a stop to this problem . 
  it 's nice that you think it 's a good thing that your uneducated people that * your * country has the responsibility of looking after , can come to the uk and germany to claim benefits here and contribute to the compression of wages of the indigenous population . 
  do you honestly think this helps the so-called european project ? 
  even if this were good for romania , it only fuels resentment between the european people and understandably so . 
  resorting to insults rather than admitting you 're wrong does n't help you look any more mature . 
  what i see is wage compression in my country and generally all northern european countries due to the influx of cheap labour from poorer countries . 
  this is hardly a good thing . 
  it 's also not a good thing for the poorer countries because it 's not helping them develop their economies . 
  what i see is a rise in xenophobia due to the above . 
  what i see is an erosion of cultural identity due to mass immigration from inside the eu . 
  all of these things are * not * good no matter how you spin it . 
  your constant ad hominem attacks sure make you look like the grown up here , 
  apples and oranges, 
  that is true . 
  however the czech republic is not romania . 
  i do n't mean to diss your country bro but it 's just a fact romania has serious problems with corruption , poverty , organized crime and human trafficking . 
  i hope romania will prosper one day but at the moment i 'm not seeing it . 
  i have never heard such a thing and i have lifed in germany all my life so i have my doubts about it bro . 
  yes and why should n't say ? 
  i love how some people here pretend police in europe are all thugs like in mexico , south america or like in most parts of the rest of the world . 
  there is a problem with police brutality in germany because of a random singular incident ? 
  it 's good if progress is being made but let 's not act as if romania was on-par with western europe . 
  and i 'm not saying it 's only romania that should n't have joined . 
  most of eastern and southern europe would be better off if they had n't been forced in a common market with strong economies such as germany . 
  just look at what 's happening to greece , for example . 
  it just does n't work and the only ones profitting from this setup are the big corporations while countries like greece go bankrupt and the standard of living for most people is going down even in better-off countries like germany . 
  italy is probably not quite as corrupt as romania or bulgaria and their economy is not that bad . 
  just stating the facts here , no need for hating . 
  no offense but i 'm not surprised . 
  i did n't expect anything else from a country like romania . 
  i feel sorry for the good romanian people but the country is corrupt to the core and it 's a joke that the country in its current state was allowed to join the eu .
