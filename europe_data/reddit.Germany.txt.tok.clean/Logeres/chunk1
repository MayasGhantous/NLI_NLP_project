so yeah , i 'm german . 
  we only want what is rightfully ours . 
  this is completely different than last time . 
  or the time before that . 
  or the time before that other time . 
  i know the feeling , mate . 
  seeing stuff like that always makes me wonder why bavaria , saxony and austria did n't create a common state . 
  they 'd get along like a refugee shelter on fire . 
   the divide on britain is pretty surprising . 
  why are germans lukewarm on the u.k. ? 
  ca n't speak for all germans , but for most people i know it 's because of their troubled relationship with the eu . 
  the eu gets a lot more support in germany than in most other countries , from what i 've heard . 
  because germany knew that it would 've hurt them more than their enemies due to their reliance on beasts of burden . 
  not to mention that the chemical weapons of that time are n't really comparable with modern nuclear weapons . 
  hitler would 've used chemical weapons in a heartbeat if he could 've hit , say , moscow with them . 
   no , nazis are national socialists , which are on the extreme left . 
  not going to judge your political views , but that part 's just not true . 
  the name of the nazi party - nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei/national socialist german workers party - was just meant to appeal to pretty much every political ideology . 
  it 's true that there was some serious debate in the early days of the party whether they should go left economically ( building a strong central state apparatus to control the economy , basically a ~ ~ more ~ ~ fascist soviet union ) or right ( loosening market regulations and gaining support from the big industry conglomerates ) , but the right faction had won out long before the nazis gained any real power . 
  socially however , the nazis were always and consistently far right . 
  a strong national identity , support for conservative or even reactionary social values and anti-egalitarianism is nothing if not far right . 
  well , i do hope the guardian pay their writers . 
  [ was n't this already on the front page a few days ago ? 
  ] ( https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/italy-not-germany-leads-europe-by-anatole-kaletsky-2016-04 ) wonder if he got paid twice ... 
  wait , yours too ? 
  how did that happen ? 
   compare it to the eu , where exactly 0 european country voters , were asked if they wanted junker as head . 
  is that how elections work in the uk ? 
  is it just a list of names and the question `` which one of these tossers do you want to be your prime minister '' ? 
   german nationalism died after world war ii . 
  any sign of germans expressing nationalistic feelings instantly gets labeled as nazi . 
  it 's not just frowned upon , it 's illegal . 
  wrong . 
  nationalism is n't illegal in germany ( unless you define nationalism as `` wanting to become nazi germany again '' ) , but since most , if not all , fascist and neo-nazi organisations and parties use nationalist symbols and paroles to mask their actual beliefs , the majority of germans at this point neither know nor care about the difference between , say , the imperial flag and the flag of the nazi party . 
   3 . corrections correct the common european asylum system , including restoring the well-functioning dublin system and its full enforcement in greece . 
  there should be stronger sanctions on a member state level against abusing asylum laws . 
  really ? 
  orban thinks the dublin system is well-functioning ? 
  because i remember [ this one country that said it could n't deal with the asylum applicants it had to take back ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33244800 ) , and thus decided to just send them on their merry way ... 
  there 's a lot of assumptions tangled up in that post , so i 'll pick them apart one after another . 
  by the way , curse you for making me look this all up . 
   do you know the eu makes british and other european farmers throw away perfectly healthy and safe food just because it 's a few millimetres out of shape or a few millimetres too big or too small . 
  firstly : no , i did n't know that . 
  mostly because they do n't . 
  aesthetic guidelines have been abolished for most foodstuff . 
  even back when they were in force , it was n't about what you were allowed to sell , but rather about what quality class your food was going to be sorted into . 
  if you wanted to have the `` extra '' ( perfect ) class , your vegetables had better be perfect in every way , including visually - but if they were n't , you could still sell them , no problem . 
  secondly : yes , food waste is a serious issue in the eu . 
  i have n't found any link between the eu food quality guidelines and the amount of food wasted , though . 
  in fact , [ the eu is encouraging member nations to reduce food waste ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/food_waste/index_en.htm ) , whilst [ the uk is still the eu nation with the highest percentage of food wasted ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/22/uk-tops-chart-of-eu-food-waste ) . 
  if this was really the fault of the eu , should n't the statistics be about the same for every member , or even higher for those proactively implementing eu regulations ? 
   do you know how much food ? 
  enough to feed sub saharan africa . 
  i never really saw the relevance of this ( not like you could just teleport the wasted food to sub-saharan africa ) , but for what it 's worth , you 're way off . 
  like the article linkes above states , food wastage in the entire eu adds up to around 89m tons . 
  [ sub-saharan africa produces around 230m tons of food ] ( http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/ ) , and has to import additional foodstuff . 
   do you know how much fish the eu makes fisherman throw back in to the sea ? 
  around half . 
  do you know the environmental impact of 200,000 tons of dead fish has ? 
  oh , and 200,00 tons ... thats just the uk . 
  400,000 tons in spain . 
  you have a point on that one . 
  it 's not actually half of it ( more like 23 % ) , but the common fishery policy was indeed terrible in regards to discarding catches . 
  you 'll be glad to hear then that the eu has [ reformed the cfp three years ago to deal with that problem ] ( http://www.technologist.eu/reducing-fish-waste/ ) ( changed the link from the official proposal , because that did n't work out . 
  you can find in on the website of the commission ) . 
   do you know how much the eu gave to greece last year ? 
  81 billion euros . 
  do you know how much greeks paid in tax last year ? 
  about 40 billion euros . 
  [ more like $ 15bn . 
  $ 86bn is the entire sum greece is going to receive over the next three years ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/assistance_eu_ms/greek_loan_facility/index_en.htm ) . 
  you might argue that 's still too much , and you might have a point on that . 
  i have honestly no idea how much money would be appropriate to pull back a country from the brink of financial ruin . 
  so , to summarise : yeah , things might not always work out perfectly in the eu , but they 're always trying to improve those areas . 
  i 'm not convinced leaving the eu would in some way help with that - britain would still be bound by those same regulations after all , just without a say in changing them . 
   i could go on about jews in malm\u00f6 , islamism or even terrorism [ ... ] please , go on about the jews in malm\u00f6 . 
  i 'd like to know about that . 
  would you say you have a jew ... problem ? 
  we will loudly protest the border closure , while being secretly relieved that the whole thing is now out of our hands . 
  i wonder why our police even bothers to investigate anymore , what with the ace detectives of / r/europe being able to divine the culprits ethnicity just by reading the word `` violence '' . 
  yeah , we do . 
  to be honest , i meant to use the english system , but i switch around so often that i usually ca n't remember who uses what . 
  oh , you think that 's scary ? 
  relative to population , that would be equivalent to 3782 dead chinese and an apocalyptical 32.940 wounded . 
  that 's more than the entire population of lechtworth in hertfordshire . 
  and we have n't even talked about the blast radius of the bombs ; multiply that by the same factor and you have an explosion larger than a german v2 rocket . 
  so while our so called `` leaders '' in the so called `` eu '' make speeches about peace and cooperations , terrorists are firing rockets and wiping out our most beautiful cities . 
  clearly , it 's time to return the favour . 
  based on your username , i 'm going to guess that was a really self-deprecating joke . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/movements-of-isis-extremist-prior-to-paris-attack-raises-eu-security-questions  the french interior minister , bernard cazeneuve , said abaaoud had played a `` decisive role '' in the paris attacks and was suspected of involvement in four of the six terror plots that french intelligence services had foiled this year . 
   but , cazeneuve pointed out , he was the subject of both a european and an international arrest warrant -- and no eu intelligence service had alerted france that he was on european soil . 
  in both munich and stuttgart around 40 % of the population have a foreign background . 
  article_topic is typical of how authority_eu has ruined place_europe . 
  you read a lot about how dictator did atrocity , but at least dictator never current_political_event !!, 
  white bread is n't better suited to rationing . 
  in fact , it 's significantly worse , because roller-grinding wheat to make white flour removes most of the nutritions from it . 
  the real reason is simply because the britons found white bread a lot more appetising than bread made from stone-ground wheat . 
  white bread was a luxury item back then , but since britain imported most of his grain from its colonies and trading partners , it was much cheaper there than in the rest of europe . 
  as a result , even relatively poor families could afford it . 
  by the time nutritional science and war rationing became a thing , the britains could n't be persuaded to part with their beloved white bread , so other types of bread never really entered the food table the way they did in other , poorer countries .
