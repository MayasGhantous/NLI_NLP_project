please note that these figures do n't exist in a vacuum . 
  they are adjustments . 
  they do not mean that the countries with negative numbers here overall get more money from the eu than they pay into it or that the ones with positive numbers pay more than they get out of the deal . 
  here is a picture of the [ same marker that includes the european flag . 
  between france and the netherlands of course . 
  actually it is on the [ island of saint martin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_martin ) in the caribbean . 
  in europe the two countries are still safely separated by belgium . 
  i feel that the problem could have been avoided by simply having the flag noticeably larger than the absolute minimum requirements . 
  if they had made the flag twice as large as the minimum requirements there would never have been a problem , but by trying to make it exactly as large the minimum requirements they left themselves no margin for error . 
  sure , they would just need to tunnel underneath much of the mediterranean and a bit of turkey . 
  they would also need to ignore that turkey , syria , jordan , israel , egypt , saudi arabia and iraq would all be closer to cyprus than the greek mainland . 
  the graphic says that they exclude exceptional events from the statistic . 
  i assume that a large part of the rather unstable energy grid in the us is due to the lack of underground and power lines which are simply less common in the us because they are more expensive and less suited to a country with such a large area and low population density . 
  enron and similar businesses probably are a factor too . 
  that makes a lot more sense . 
  edited to : nevermind . 
  i originally misread geen as green . 
  so it does n't actually involve asking about pronouns and accusing disney of whitewashing cultural approbation . 
  i think this is mixing up head of state and heads of government . 
  for most countries those are two very different offices . 
  you see that tiny , slightly greenish tip in the north west of the us ? 
  that is where stephanie meyer set her stories about sparkling vampires , who moved there because it was so dark and got so little sunshine . 
  it puts things a bit into perspective , if you realize how much sunnier forks is than a lot of europe . 
  remember that the unemployment rates do n't actually mean what percentage of the population is unemployed or even what percentage of the working age population is unemployed . 
  according to the source the unemployed here : * are between 15 and 74 years old ; * are without work ; * are available to start work within the next two weeks ; * and have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks . 
  they take the number of those ` unemployed ' people and add them to the number of people deemed to be employed to get the total labour force . 
  and then they see how many of those are unemployed . 
  so in a country with 25 % unemployment there is one person looking for work for every 3 who have a job . 
  housewives and those who have given up on looking for a job are not counted in this statistic at all . 
  also note that the values here are seasonally adjusted and not the actual values . 
  nothing is keeping you from setting up your own email server in your own data-centre or even at home . 
  it just wo n't do you any good though since email is essentially the equivalent of a postcard security wise . 
  everyone involved in passing it from sender to recipient can read the entire thing . 
  i have no idea . 
  i took the table from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_the_number_of_us_dollar_billionaires ) . 
  there should be two [ belgians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_belgians_by_net_worth ) up there : * albert frere - us$ 3.7 billion * patokh chodiev - us$ 2.1 billion, 
  related statistic : | | | | | : -- :| : -- :| : -- :| | rank | nation | number of billionaires 2012 | | 1 | russia | 110 | | 2 | germany | 58 | 3 | turkey | 43 | 4 | united kingdom | 37 | 5 | france | 24 | 6 | italy | 23 7 | spain | 20 8 | sweden | 14 9 | switzerland | 13 10 | ukraine | 10 | 11 | austria | 8 12 | netherlands | 6 12 | norway | 6 | 12 | denmark | 6 13 | ireland | 5 14 | poland | 4 14 | czech republic | 4 | 15 | portugal | 3 | 15 | greece | 3 | 15 | monaco | 3 | 16 | belgium | 2 * | 17 | romania | 1 | 17 | guernsey | 1 | 17 | georgia | 1 | of course it is questionable whether having a large number of billionaires in your country is actually a good or bad thing . 
  \\* edited to add belgium which was missing from the [ original source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_the_number_of_us_dollar_billionaires ) . 
  i guess `` suicide tourists '' has a better ring to it than `` escapees from a forced life in agony '' or `` euthanasia refugees '' . 
  i think it should be mentioned that today parents if they are in their 20s or 30s likely grew up with video games themselves . 
  video games are not a new phenomenon like they were decades ago . 
  parents should have as good a grip on the concept when raising children as they have on things like letting or forbidding their kids watch television . 
  lots . 
  you can generally assume that if there is a well known latin phrase in english it will also be used in german . 
  and it is not just phrases . 
  many many loanwords from latin are used in both languages . 
  if you ever do n't know the right word for a concept , you can pick the latin-derived word for it in one language switch around the spelling and hope for the best . 
  it also works for greek loanwords to a degree . 
  since these loanwords often are a bit more formal than native synonyms this can lead to the funny sounding result of some people who have hit on this trick using a lot of ` big words ' in a language they barely speak . 
  for example you might not know that ` spelling ' translates to ` rechtschreibung ' but you can guess that ` orthography ' becomes ` orthographie ' . 
  i do n't know . 
  it has a bit too much of a nautical/maritime feel to me . 
  looking at all those gold stripes on blue makes me want to count them to figure out if i am in front of the ships ' captain or just a deck hand . 
  the russian version sounds more like they had a * dedicated hot-spare * truck . 
  i am not quite sure what indicators they are measuring , but east germany generally still is lagging somewhat behind in many economic indicators . 
  it is however not too far behind the rest of germany and is probably on par or surpasses the west on many other ` development ' indicators . 
  since it is smaller it should n't have too much of an effect on the combined average in any way . 
  [ good point . 
  ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-3-inequality-adjusted-human-development-index ) but even with the inequality-adjusted hdi australia remains in place 2 . 
  my knowledge of australia is rather limited , but i was under the impression that they had poverty stricken aboriginals , asylum seekers in camps and rich landowners who own properties the size of an european country . 
  how come they are not considered more inequal than they are ? 
  [ here is a link to the full report ( pdf ) .

  well , we are in 6th place world wide just behind the us and you would have to ask yourself : `` would i want to live there ? '', 
  norway , australia , switzerland and the netherlands are in place 1 to 4 respectively . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/gioeh34fhxe?t=54s ), 
  i think i just lost half an hour playing around with the different visualization functions for the data . 
  this is really a good website and very interesting . 
  i believe that there a just as many gods per capita in eastern germany as there are anywhere else in europe . 
  nobody is claiming that he drove out all the alligators , crocodiles and caimans from poland , but you wo n't find many of them outside any zoos today . 
  all joking aside thanks to the interkosmos program poland was actually the 4th nation that could into space . 
  after the soviet union and later the us sent people into space in the 60s , russia started a program that would send cosmoauts from allied nations into space . 
  [ miros\u0142aw hermaszewski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros%c5%82aw_hermaszewski ) was the second of these men , a few months after vladim\u00edr remek and a few months before sigmund j\u00e4hn . 
  actually considering the fact that neither the ussr nor czechslovakia are still around poland is actually the second existing nation to can into space . 
  i think the problem is that while a lot of german politicians and german spies would like to come to an agreement with the us about spying on german citizens behind closed doors , many of the actual citizens of germany would prefer it if they were n't spied upon at all . 
  by being so bumbling as to allow all these revelations about spying to come to light the us spy apparatus has basically forced german politicians to try and look like they are doing something . 
  sure the politicians can try to declared a matter to be over , but that works better if there is n't a new revelation out a week later . 
  some german politicians are all but bending over backwards to help us spies spy on germans , but you have to give them something to work with . 
  the ambassador * `` was asked to help in the swift clarification '' * . 
  is that like the british * helping the police with their inquiries * thing ? 
  he was n't fined for cycling with only one arm , he was fined for not having a break on both handlebars . 
  the rules are that you have to have a break for both your front and back wheel . 
  obviously he was in compliance with the spirit of the law ( and it turns out the letter of the law ) since his bike was modified in such a way that he could still break both wheels despite only having one hand . 
  a stupid bureaucrat was trying to be overly literal when applying the law . 
  he did not care that to a man who is missing his right arm a break on his right handlebar would be useless and tried to write him a ticket . 
  thanks to the media picking the story up and higher ranking bureaucrats alarmed at the bad pr overruled the idiot and dropped the fine before the whole thing resulted in more bad press or a lawsuit . 
  i think deciding which side of the road to drive on would come before trying to standardize some of the smaller stuff . 
  note that the total length of school vacation might be larger . 
  germany for example has 12.5 weeks of school free of which only 6 or 7 end up being in the summer break . 
  while he has some sort of point , i think we can all agree her that the distinction between eastern and eastern europe are n't completely gone even a quarter of a century after the fall of the iron curtain . 
  every day some map or table or chart gets posted her or in / r/dataisbeautiful and on most of them you can still very clearly see the divide between the two is still very visible in most of them . 
  there are still a lot of distinctions especially in economic areas but also in cultural one . 
  yes , it is not a homogeneous group . 
  nations like slovenia appear to be catching up fast in the ` east ' while nominally western countries are falling behind in many financial and economic comparisons . 
  but for now the distinction is still useful for many things . 
  [ here is a different image of the logo i found online ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gwck98h.png ) , you can more clearly see that it is not the gate . 
  besides it would have been strange to have two structures from the same city on there .
