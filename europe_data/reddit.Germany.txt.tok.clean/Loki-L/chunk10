  since gold is rather heavy i think the gold from ny will be transported by ship rather than plane , which will open the door for * pirates * . 
  throw in some plot about blowing up the supposed gold transport to cover up that it is all fake and some unlikely plot to distract everyone and you are good . 
  now for the casting of the crew that will pull of the heist . 
  we will need an old guy , a rookie , a chick , a traitor , a big but dumb guy , a casanova , a nerd and a few assorted others ... 
  welcome to [ / r/spiesgonewild ] ( / r/spiesgonewild ), 
  bulgarians !, 
  i was wondering who that addition was for and for a moment i feared the \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e was some sort of indication of an annexation of russia that nobody told be about . 
  i can live with bulgaria . 
  i think the question we should ask is not the one in the article :  `` i would like to know whether the european union has the power to intervene militarily in the current crisis in mali ? '' or even the headline  `` should the eu intervene in mali ? 
  '' , but `` do we have a realistic chance of actually improving things over there with military might . '', 
  bombing things is easy nation building is hard . 
   he also pointed out that he would be in germany during the last week of january , and that he might be willing to talk then . 
  we shall see . 
  this seems to me like the ` refusal ' part of the headline might be overstating things too much . 
  nevertheless by including someone writing editorials critical of israels government in the list they have already devalued it . 
  and since it is a ` tradition ' started only in 2010 that has n't had time to accrue any great credibility of its own yet and mostly was accepted based on the credibility of the organisation publishing it , this misstep is costing the organization itself credibility . 
  actually i think the eurovision thing was supposed to broadcast more than just the song contest . 
  i remember the distinctive te deum intro before other big tv events , but i have n't seen any in years . 
  yes , but did they already figure in the gain in sunshine due to daylight saving time ? 
  just kidding . 
  the thing that surprised me , was that the baltic coast seems to be getting much more sunlight than expected , even high up north . 
  that small tip at the north of denmark too . 
  there is also the obvious observation that if arizona or southern california were into solar energy as much as germany is they would be far better at it . 
  lastly i hate myself for realizing that the pale tip in the north-western corner of the continental united states was probably were `` twilight '' was set . 
  there are skyscrapers in europe look for example at this : [ skyline of frankfurt ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/cityscape_frankfurt_2010-2.jpg/1280px-cityscape_frankfurt_2010-2.jpg ) but frankfurt is an exception . 
  to find out why one might look at the reasons why people built giant skyscrapers . 
  usually it is a combination of status symbol and an attempt at putting lots of floorspace in a very attractive location . 
  places . 
  a city state has more large skyscrapers than much of europe combined simply because they do n't have any space . 
  even in places like japan and the us where there technically is enough space people want to built in specific regions like new york or tokyo . 
  there are also places like dubai where they have more money than sense or that giant pyramid shaped hotel in pyongyang where they do n't have any money and even less sense . 
  for much of the rest of the world there simply is not enough reason to build up rather than out . 
  i have to wonder about the methodology used for this . 
  i personally am not a big user of twitter . 
  but many of the tweets i have seen seem to be full of made-up , shortened , misspelled or mutilated words . 
  how do you use statistical analysis on something like that ? 
  what about all the anglicisms used and what about the migrants who generally tweet in one language but pepper the whole with occasional words from another ? 
  edited to add : a legend would have been nice . 
  what is the blue stuff in the background in france and germany ? 
  it looks like the same hue as italian , but surely that ca n't be right . 
  also what is up with poland ? 
  polish the same or a similar colour to german or is everyone in poland tweeting in german for some reason ? 
  also why did they have to make turkish and german similar colours ? 
  an interactive map where you could display the dots only for the selected languages would perhaps have been better . 
  hard to say what such a volatile mix it would be like . 
  to be honest i do n't think that realistically speaking it would be very stable . 
  i was actually thinking of an italian as head of government , but why not both ? 
  flanders and wallonia . 
  please note that they seem to measure cars per people and not cars per adults theoretically capable of driving a vehicle . 
  there is an obvious correlation between age structure and car ownership per total population . 
  the us has a far younger population with those too young to drive a car making up a far greater percentage of the population even if you take into account the fact that drivers licenses are handed out in the us to people at a younger age . 
  the us also has not insignificant percentage of their population too poor or too in prison to drive a car in comparison with western europe . 
  since one of the main goals in live is to survive . 
  i think childhood mortality and overall life expectancy at birth should pay a far greater role . 
  some of the high ranked places are probably nice if you are born to the right set of parents ( and male ) , but if it is completely random you ca n't really say that germany is as good a place to be born as the usa . 
  well , there is a long way to go , but in the long term i would not say it wo n't happen . 
  there are parts of turkey that are very european culturally speaking and there are other parts that are not . 
  the religion thing should not be an issue as long as they tone it down and do not let it influence their politics too much . 
  the human rights thing has been improving but has still a bit to go . 
  the corruption thing is a problem but hardly unique to turkey . 
  the poverty thing is a big issue and the main problem in my opinion . 
  turkey is both big and poor ( by european standards ) . 
  once the economy recovers and turkey manages to come closer to the europen average this might be different but at the moment it would be a deal breaker . 
  other consideration include the fact that with turkey in the eu . 
  the eu would officially border on some very not nice neighbourhoods . 
  such an expansion might interact in unexpected ways with pushes to get a united military and give justification for the rise of an american style military industrial complex . 
  the geography thing makes the least bit of sense to me . 
  cyprus is more asian than turkey geographically speaking and the eu has parts of it that are in the atlantic , the pacific , the caribbean and of the coast of south america . 
  yes , very much this . 
  i have witnessed several organizations going for open source alternatives , but however they dressed it up it all boiled down to : `` we wo n't have to pay for the software and we can keep using our old hardware . 
  we are going to save so much money . '', 
  the fact that they would need to retrain users and upgrade their in house it support often falls by the wayside . 
  when poor planing and saving on the wrong things bites them in the ass sooner or later they conclude that it did n't work out as expected because open source was not mature or professional or enterprisy enough . 
  open source can be a valid alternative . 
  if implemented right it can even be a cheaper alternative . 
  but it only works if it done right . 
  for some reason the most common themes her are people looking up facts about their own home-country or national hero , people looking uo things about stuff they should know like facebook or youtube of wiki and people are looking up things like the lists of people who died in 2012 . 
  interesting things of note : * poland seems interested in the european regional development fund for some reason . 
  * russians care about internet pornography . 
  * both slovaks and spaniards looked up the @ - sign for some reason . 
  * go appears to be big in turkey . 
  * estonians care about the european union and the us . 
  * and the germany were interested in cul-de-sacs . 
  people are weird . 
  if that is the way he thinks then perhaps an investigation into his personal affairs and relationships is warranted to see if there are any victims around who provoked him . 
  or maybe take a good look at the family he grew up in and see if his mother sibling or himself were victims and this is just his way of dealing with it . 
  other then that perhaps he just needs a good punch in the face . 
  yes , this appears to be less morivated by religious zealotry and more by being asshole looking for a fight . 
  [ yes .

  personally i go by the [ sprocle definition ] ( http://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world ) . 
  if it is a correct answer in the quiz it counts as a country . 
  there , that was easy . 
  i will live . 
  why are you ( with a finnish flag ) linking to the spanish version of a wikipedia article about someone who is swiss on an english language subreddit ? 
  further candidates : [ ecb president mario draghi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mario_draghi ) [ ecj president vassilios skouris ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vassilios_skouris ) [ uefa president michel platini ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michel_platini ) [ esa director general jean-jacques dordain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-jacques_dordain ) [ europol director rob wainwright ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rob_wainwright_ ( europol % 29 ) the list goes on . 
  i think they only shaded the drainage areas of europe 's largest rivers and their tributaries . 
  here is a [ map of the drainage basins of ireland ] ( http://www.gsi.ie/nr/rdonlyres/780bfc43-af88-4969-8b08-029840c7ff6f/0/river_basin_districts_1.jpg ), 
  it is surprising how much of europe drain into the black sea . 
  realistically or hopefully ?
