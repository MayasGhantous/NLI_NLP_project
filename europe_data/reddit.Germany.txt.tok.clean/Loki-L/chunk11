  well we had n't really had a french-german war since wwii and european integration deservers some credit for that . 
  ( 3/4 of a century must be some sort of record even if you go back in time before there was a unified germany . ), 
  i sort of hope we can continue to build on that . 
  a complete lack of wars ( large , small and civil ones ) seems like a good idea , also even the greatest optimist has to admit that a century is a long time . 
  perhaps further integration and a continual and gradual transference of sovereignty from nation states to the european union can help avoid any wars between european states until 2112 . 
  a bit of a loss of national identity would be a small price to pay for that . 
  i would also hope for some better cultural integration of immigrants into our society and an overall cultural synchronization across europe . 
  modern telecommunication and transportation infrastructure will help with the latter part . 
  as for the former ; i do n't see the horror scenarios of being overrun and outbreed by barbarian hordes that some see , but instead hopefully extrapolate the already evident cultural assimilation that has been going on for years or decades . 
  with a little luck there wo n't be enough difference between any of us to matter enough to start a fight over . 
  economically i hope that we can get over the current financial trouble and raise up the poorer european countries closer to the level of the richer ones . 
  i would hope that the euro gets extended a bit more once the current troubles are over . 
  there need not be a superpower status involved . 
  i would hope for more power to esa and perhaps a few more similar ventures . 
  i am not particularly in favour of a unified military , but if t saves me taxes and is mostly use as a deterrence and for the occasional humanitarian mission i could live with that development . 
  i would hope for some more reforms of the eu that would give it more power but also more democracy . 
  realistically i know that things wo n't always work out that well and that there will be all sorts of crises and stuff , but i remain hopeful . 
  pessimistically i would otherwise have to admit that the whole thing might be doomed . 
  that the eu will fall apart and that right wing demagogues will gain power all over the place as they take advantage of people 's dissatisfaction . 
  that there will be dictatorships in what is now a europe mostly made up of free democracies and perhaps wars civil and uncivil ones . 
  i would also have to give thought to foreign powers overshadowing us and foreign conflicts influencing us . 
  i would have to entertain scenarios of outside threats coming after europe whether it is united or not . 
  of course all that will be a mute point since by all estimates in 2047 ( around november or december ) human civilization will be destroyed in a grey goo scenario nano-technology catastrophe . 
  too bad about not giving esa more funding . 
  luxembourg sounds like it would bring the fewest problems with it . 
  they wo n't want any money and there are so few of them that they wo n't get any say . 
  the last time it was an austrian at the helm if i remember correctly . 
  things should go better with german leadership . 
  best : working public transportation . 
  ( it sometimes is even punctual . ), 
  worst : all the shops are closed when you are n't at work . 
  i think it is sort of refreshing to have a government agency actually looking out for your online privacy and right to free anonymous speech . 
  that has to be the least useful and intuitive way to represent that information . 
  it is very hard to compare the relative darkness of areas not directly adjectant to each other and it is not obvious if darker is better . 
  the legend is to small to be useful . 
  i think you only get to make one or two commemorative 2 $ coins a year plus one extra if your pope or monarch dies . 
  i have also only ever seen coins where the observe side was changed the common side was the same for all of them . 
  what would they put on the coins ? 
  the coat of arms on all of them or something different . 
  are there any proposed design circulating on the net ? 
  blessed are the cheesemakers,
