  i did n't vote for her , but i have to point out that the scale in this graph only goes from 40 % to 80 % . 
  she still has about half the population satisfied with her . 
  49 % might not seem much compared to the 75 % she had in april according to this graph , but compared to other world leaders this is still not too bad . 
  there are elections tomorrow . 
  if the idiot had just wanted to send a message he could have voted . 
  this is supposed to be a democracy , not some sort of third world hell-hole where a bunch of lunatics start massacring people when they do n't get their way . 
  well , it seems that in this case : a ) the knife or knives used may have been actually illegal . 
  b ) no one was actually killed in this . 
  c ) the way to beat a bad guy with a knife in this case apparently was several good guys/girls armed with cheap campaign branded umbrellas . 
  flags for languages are bad , but you know what i think is the worst idea for language selection menus . 
  when they list the languages translated into your own language based on the detected language and the preferences of your system . 
  if they guess your language right it is unnecessary , if they guess wrong it is useless because you might not know the name of your language in whatever they detected . 
  the worst of this i have seen ( and i have seen this multiple times ) is when they list the languages by the names of the languages in your own language , do n't bother to preselect the language they are displaying the page in and this really gets me : they display the localized version of the list , but they keep the alphabetic sorting based on the english names ... 
  they will list `` deutsch '' but sort it among the `` g `` s. who does that ? 
  if i had seen it once i could have put it of as a bad programmer who did n't think their idea all the way though , but i have seen this multiple times now . 
  either there are multiple developers making the same mistake or this is some kind of pattern that is already included in some off the shelf modules or code snippets that get passed around . 
  hopefully this works out better than the last time somebody made some thesis about religion there was some slight prolonged civil unrest afterwards as a result . 
  well there are people who think that the polarization is important for some reason and prevent you from sticking your plug in the wrong way . 
  that is why the french , who have otherwise completely normal schuko inlets have this little metal prong in it for ground instead of the contacts on either side . 
  it is crazy but most plugs in germany accommodate the crazy notion by having a hole in the plug and a side contact for the ground so they will work in both . 
  no it does n't . 
  yelling `` heil hitler '' , cheering when others are trying to burn down refugees homes and justifying the holocaust however does make you a neo-nazi and curiously enough half the time when somebody tells me that they are just concerned about the future of the country and its traditional values those things worm themselves into the conservation somehow . 
  i have had conservations here on reddit where some guy took offence at being labelled a neo-nazis for being against asylum seekers , but their posting history was full of blaming the jews for stuff and doubting the holocaust . 
  not everyone who is ` concerned ' is automatically a nazi , but a surprising number turn out to be nevertheless . 
  it would be more efficient and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort . 
  running more than 2 dozen militarys separately will cost more than running them as a single entity . 
  how recent are those numbers . 
  i expect that with trump now at the wheel in the us , many people in europe may be starting to feel that self-reliance and reliance on each other may be gaining greater priority . 
  clintom possibly could have been relied upon to lead the us in another stupid war or two if the opportunity presented itself . 
  trump sound more focused on domestic issues and is far to chummy with putin and co to feel reliable as an ally . 
  a better integrated military may be the best choice to keep things peaceful without spending too much on new weapons whose sole purpose is to exist as a deterrent . 
  i am not going to accuse anybody of anything , but the article and the graphs did not seem to include an single mention of the word russia or russian . 
  i guess it might be different in other countries but over here persons of russian ancestry make up a good portion of the inmates behind bars . 
  i would have expected them to at least appear somewhere in the lists . 
  was n't iraq in the news recently for efforts to recriminalize homosexuality ? 
  i would be interested in a breakdown for genders . 
  i expect that in places like italy the number of sons living with their mothers would outweigh the number of daughters for example . 
  it appears to be based on some standards published by the uk government . 
  the original where it is supposed to come from is down but there is a similar table is the back of this [ pdf ] ( http://cyps.northyorks.gov.uk/chttphandler.ashx?id=18505&amp;p=0 ) . 
  it includes codes that differentiate : gre greek gre grea greek ( any other ) gre grec greek ( cyprus ) or por portuguese por pora portuguese ( any other ) por porb portuguese ( brazil ) or rmn romanian rmn rmnm romanian ( moldova ) rmn rmnr romanian ( romania ) you can probably see how this is a potential minefield . 
  yes minister explained the general idea behind that almost 4 decades ago :  ** sir humphrey ** : * minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
  * ** hacker ** : that 's all ancient history , surely ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : * yes , and current policy . 
  we ` had ' to break the whole thing up , so we had to get inside . 
  we tried to break it up from the outside , but that would n't work . 
  now that we 're inside we can make a complete pig 's breakfast of the whole thing : set the germans against the french , the french against the italians , the italians against the dutch . 
  the foreign office is terribly pleased ; it 's just like old times . 
  * ** hacker ** : but surely we 're all committed to the european ideal ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : * really , minister . 
  * ** hacker ** : if not , why are we pushing for an increase in the membership ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : * well , for the same reason . 
  it 's just like the united nations , in fact ; the more members it has , the more arguments it can stir up , the more futile and impotent it becomes . 
  * ** hacker ** : what appalling cynicism . 
  ** sir humphrey ** : * yes ... we call it diplomacy , minister . 
  your mother may have told you that you should n't jump of a cliff just because everyone else is doing it , but if you find yourself surrounded by people acting in a certain way , it is always a good idea to find out why they are doing it just in case they have a very good reason . 
  if people are buying the shops empty on saturday there may be a long weekend ahead . 
  it helps to check . 
  similar situations apply to question like `` why is everyone ignoring the seemingly open lane ? '', 
  or `` why is everyone queuing up behind the long lines ? 
  '' , `` why is nobody sitting in this almost empty train car ? '', 
  or `` why are all these japanese people running in the other direction screaming something about a ` go-ji-ra ' ? '', 
  it is more like a bad mix of all the languages of all the groups who have ever invaded the island plus some bits of vocabulary taken from around the world in more recent times when the english started to invade places themselves . 
  they also stripped out all the useful grammar out of the mix because it was to hard . 
  i wanted to emphasize that this was n't the sort of shooting you hear about in the news from places like the us . 
  they did n't shoot him from far away because he had a weapon in his hand , the two cops actually were both wounded by the attacker before one of them decided to use deadly force on him . 
  apparently the list includes : * [ naked man in fountain attacks police with knife ] ( http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article117539317/nackter-mann-im-neptunbrunnen-erschossen.html ) * [ man decides he does not want to go to prison and attacks half a dozen armed cops with a knife and after resisting pepper spray gets shot in the but . 
  ] ( http://www.allgaeu-tipp.de/dies-und-das/11-3-2015-mann-in-memmingen-von-polizei-erschossen/ ) * [ man attacks police who came because of reports about a domestic disturbance with a knife , continues despite being pepper sprayed and gets shot . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/polizist-erschiesst-mit-messer-bewaffneten-mann-in-gruenstadt-a-1030966.html ) * [ 74 year old pensioner does n't want to go to a clinic and shoots at police . 
  police shoot back . 
  ] ( https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/weltgeschehen/article141040678/sek-erschiesst-rentner-kurz-vor-einweisung-in-klinik.html ) * [ man decides its a good idea to stab somebody with a knife inside a police precinct and to ignore a police officer who tries to get him to stop . 
  when cops arrive he starts stabbing them and gets shot . 
  ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/polizei-justiz/messerattacke-auf-polizistin-in-berlin-spandau-erschossener-angreifer-rafik-y-war-bekannter-islamist/12332498.html ) * [ man decides to stab people inside a casino and then to stab police officers who come to try to stop him . 
  after having enough of being stabbed police shoot him . 
  police end up shooting a man with a knife . 
  ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/familienstreit-in-gronau-polizei-erschiesst-einen-mann-in-der-fussgaengerzone-1.2720850 ) i am missing two shootings , but the pattern of it being a bad idea to attack police officers with knives appears to be clear . 
  fun fact : in japanese the days of the week are named after the sun and moon and the five elements . 
  the sun-day and moon-day map to out sunday and monday . 
  the days named after the elements also map to the days of the week as used is roman-influenced europe . 
  japana ( and china and vietnam i think ) name the planets ( at least the ones visible to the naked eye and know since ancient times ) after these elements . 
  and the planets match the same planets that are named after the corresponding roman gods . 
  tuesday ( named after tyr in english but after mars in most romance lanaguages ) is fired-day in japan and mars is the fire-star . 
  i am still not quite sure how anyone could think that voting to leave the eu would lead to `` pakis going back '' . 
  or how they were so dissatisfied with their politicians who seemingly did n't care for them and their region that they voted to remove the only group that not only provided the slightest semblance of oversight over these politicians but also quite often did majorly invest in their region . 
  this was not all down to misinformation but at least partly due to critical thinking failure . 
  on the plus side . 
  the afd now can show the public what they would actually do if they were given some power . 
  they wo n't be part of the new government , but they will have to actually participate in the whole legislative process for a few years . 
  so far whenever a far right part has gained enough seats to be part of a regional parliament , they embarrassed themselves enough with their inability to participate and destroyed themselves with infighting . 
  the afd will now have to show that they have more to offer than just populist phrases and the press will gleefully report whenever one of their new regional mps will say something stupid . 
  in the past the green party managed to go from a group of protestors who threw stones at police and had all sorts of unrealistic ideas to a part of the establishment that gets at least taken seriously by everyone . 
  if the afd can grow beyond their single issue campaign on refugees to have reasonable position on other topics that most of their voters agree with , than good for them . 
  i hope that they will prove inept enough at the whole thing that voters will decided not to vote for them again in more important elections . 
  it is the same thing throughout much of the world . 
  sometimes you find reminders in the most unlikely places about how big the railway network used to be . 
  abandoned tracks , old station buildings in towns nowhere near a rail line , industrial areas that have parts of rails visible through the street surface and my favourite : street names that promise a train station where there is none . 
  i saw an old map of a local city once that had half a dozen station all over the city . 
  it looked like a monopoly board with a central station plus one named after each cardinal direction .
