  yes , [ the acropolis where the parthenon is . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/58rbknkbjvc?t=1m40s ), 
  as far as i can tell the pictured buildings are : [ the colosseum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colosseum ) , [ st. martin 's cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dom_tower_of_utrecht ) , [ the sagrada fam\u00edlia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sagrada_fam%c3%adlia ) , [ the eiffel tower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eiffel_tower ) , [ the fernsehturm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fernsehturm_berlin ) and [ the acropolis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acropolis_of_athens ), 
  well there are other arguments . 
  for example there are currently zero active high-level radioactive waste repositories in europe . 
  many people feel that unless somebody can come up with and implement a solution that is safe and actually works to get rid of these types of radioactive waste we should stop producing it . 
  when you quoted me you carefully cut of the part where i said that i was n't trying to argue that point . 
  i am aware of these statistics . 
  over a 1000 people alone died in chinese coal mines accidents last year and that is not even going into later deaths of miners due to coal lung or the actual ecological and health consequences of burning coal . 
  that stuff obviously carries an enormous price in blood . 
  however the actual deaths mostly happen to the very people involved in the mining or are extremely indirect . 
  if you do n't work in a coal mine , coal might still kill you , but it will be so indirect that it will be hard to connect cause and effect above a statistical level . 
  chernobyl on the other hand was scary because of its sheer size and the very obvious connection between the accident and all the bad shit going . 
  this is like people being more afraid of flying in an airplane than driving a car . 
  planes are statistically speaking safer , but that does n't really enter into people 's perception of the risks . 
  people do n't want nuclear reactors in their backyards because they are perceived as dangerous . 
  it is a simple as that . 
  i would like to see more about their sources and metrics for [ this chart . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i373nzf.png ) i know our healthcare system is not perfect , but surely it ca n't be that bad compared to the uk . 
  the whole having a ** 1 ** in almost every category makes it look as if the uk is either that much better than everyone else at healthcare or if they carefully chose their metrics to emphasis the very things they knew they would be good at . 
  yes , it is a good thing that incompetence , corruption and cutting corners will never happen anywhere else . 
  look i am not saying that nuclear power is inherently less safe than other types of energy sources , the picture was just to illustrate why most people might be a bit reluctant to have one in their backyard . 
  [ i wonder why ? 
  yes , the brain drain that comes with being part of the eu is bad , but the push towards curbing the corruption and the various means of financial and other support from the eu is good . 
  i think the good parts outweigh the bad parts here . 
  the ruling makes sense , but you have to wonder how he managed to actually accumulate 140 days of leave . 
  considering that a year only has about 250 work days in germany 140 is a lot . 
  you could start your vacation on january 1st ( or 2nd because 1st is a holiday ) and not show up to work until the last week of july ... did he never take more than the legal minimum in his decade of employment and then went on to accumulate leave while he was sick for two years ? 
  i got a bit too distracted by the image of the woman to concentrate on the article . 
  between the white lace-pattern on blue of her clothes and the background creating some sort of camouflage effect , the style of her haircut and use of makeup and what appears to be the most unflattering shot of her nose that the photographer could have made the photo sort of sticks out . 
  it sort of gives the whole story a feel of trying to look professional and failing horribly . 
  the stuff mentioned in the article : asking friends on facebook as a way of ` fact-checking ' not informing news organisation and giving them a chance to correct their stories ( never thought of that ) and generally acting like they are doing something groundbreaking and new and not realizing that there are established terms and procedures that better fit what they are trying to do . 
  it al together with the photo paints a picture of earnest ambition to do something but only coming across as silly looking . 
  to be honest , it often feels as if the uk was only in the eu to stop the rest of europe from uniting . 
  the british want to have a say in how things a run , but do n't actually seem to want to participate in the whole european integration thing . 
  there comes a point where you have to ask what it is exactly they want if not a united europe and why they are part of an organization that seems to have this at its goal . 
  maybe the uk leaving the eu and opting for a looser affiliation that only includes the things it actually wants would be better . 
  they will loose their say in how the rest of europe continues to develop but they wo n't be part of it either . 
  i have never heard it called that . 
  i am not sure how relevant the greek data is when it is 2 month behind everyone else . 
  normally you see a somewhat steep fall in unemployment in the spring for a number of reasons . 
  they might be better of that spain right now . 
  then again employment in greece probably is n't subject to high seasonal ups and downs the way northern countries are simply because they are less affected by the seasons . 
  i do n't know . 
   * the democratic deficit : a significant part of the european bureaucrats are unelected , which is quite unpopular thing . 
  but the reaction to the result of an election is to threaten to quit the eu if the will of the voters is followed ? 
  the linked article seems to be mostly about american problems with little or no connection to europe . 
  the only passage mentioning europe appears to be :  in practical terms , this means that u.s. alliances constitute a massive wealth transfer from u.s. taxpayers to ** bloated european welfare states ** and technologically-advanced asian nations . 
  in most of these countries , the governments who are relieved of the responsibility of defending their citizens from threats have chosen to spend their money on other things . 
  we are n't even pope anymore either . 
  this is a ~ ~ bit ~ ~ lot like comparing apples and oranges . 
  the ukrainian election was using an entirely different system , people were voting in a different context and for a different purpose . 
  the eu elections encouraged voters to vote small parties since even parties that got as little as 0.6 % of the vote in only a single of the 28 countries still ended up with a seat in the eu parliament . 
  the ukrainian election on the other hand was for a single candidate for one office that was decided by simple majority . 
  which naturally encouraged people to vote for a person with better chances of winning rather than one who more closely represented their own interests . 
  comparing the two as if they were in any way equivalent is extremely dishonest . 
  the $ 450 jobs ( the limit was raised from $ 400 to $ 450 in 2013 ) are n't supposed to be enough to live on , that is why you still get benefits while doing them . 
  the idea is that you get your normal benefits and you can earn extra spending money up to $ 450 additionally . 
  if you are on hartz iv ( the lowest level of benefits ) the government will pay your rent , health insurance , retirement contributions etc and give you enough money to pay utilities and buy groceries . 
  i was lucky enough not to have been on that for too long and having a small sub-400 euro job on the side , but i found it was quite doable . 
  of course i did n't have any expensive hobbies , addictions or kids back then either and was generally living within my means . 
  things would have been harder if i were the smoking , drinking or drug doing typing . 
  no to mention i did n't have a car . 
  while everyone 's experience will be different and things probably have changed a lot since then , i feel that if you are starving , freezing or experience some other form of extreme hardship while on hartz iv , you are probably doing something extremely wrong . 
  i would argue that even on hartz iv a youth in germany is n't living in what you would consider poverty . 
  ( i would argue that because several years ago i was living on hartz iv myself and while poor i was n't exactly living in what i would consider poverty . ), 
  sure you can come up with some concept of relative poverty instead of absolute poverty , but then some will always live in poverty . 
  we do ? 
  i mean of course we do . 
  its obvious . 
  but seriously while the article might have a lot of things that could be argued about i think there is a small kernel truth there somewhere and it all traces back to the german mittelstand . 
  germany if full of these small mostly privately owned companies that form the backbone of our economy . 
  while not all of them are particularly innovative not all of them have to be . 
  there are many of them and if a few a spurned by competition to try something that usually is all it takes . 
  if it works out others will try to do the same . 
  think of it as sort of the european equivalent to trading cards , just without the collectors value . 
  actually unemployment in germany is down . 
  it fell by 61,000 last month . 
  there were fewer unemployed in germany in may than in april . 
  the problem is that every year there are fewer unemployed in may than in april in germany and in previous years that number was as high as 100,000 . 
  the 24,000 number comes from trying to calculate the regular seasonal differences away . 
  this obviously wo n't work as well if there are fewer seasonal differences . 
  the milder winter means that the difference between the season was less server so there will naturally be a small seasonal upturn . 
  in total the number of those fully employed actually rose compared to last year and appears to continue to rise . 
  so in closing the numbers are not as good as many people would have hoped and there is definitive room for improvement , but it appears to be a misrepresentation to say that unemployment in germany is rising when in truth the opposite is the case . 
  i think you just do n't get the subtle nature of their comedy . 
  year 2000 seems fairly recent until you realize that it was 14 years ago . 
  i rather doubt that it would still look like that today . 
  what percentage of english speakers would recognize the english flag ? 
  please pick the correct flag for english : [ ** ( 1 ) ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/flag_of_denmark.svg/200px-flag_of_denmark.svg.png ) [ ** ( 2 ) ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/flag_of_the_dominican_republic.svg/200px-flag_of_the_dominican_republic.svg.png ) [ ** ( 3 ) ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/flag_of_england.svg/200px-flag_of_england.svg.png ) [ ** ( 4 ) ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/flag_of_switzerland.svg/200px-flag_of_switzerland.svg.png ) [ ** ( 5 ) ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/flag_of_georgia.svg/200px-flag_of_georgia.svg.png ) [ ** ( 6 ) ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/flag_of_canada.svg/200px-flag_of_canada.svg.png ) [ ** ( 7 ) ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/flag_of_the_basque_country.svg/200px-flag_of_the_basque_country.svg.png ) [ ** ( 8 ) ** ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/flag_of_the_red_cross.svg/200px-flag_of_the_red_cross.svg.png ), 
  this seems to me to be a classic case of wanting to both have your cake and eat it at the same time . 
  if the turkish cypriots wanted to vote in an eu election they would need to allow the cypriot government to create polling places and other government institutions on their side of the island . 
  i guess most data does n't come on this level to be turned into maps . 
  most of the time you either have country comparison statistics ( from places like eurostat ) or you have to search statistics from various regional sub-units country by country and hope they all measured the same thing the same way and that you are not comparing apples and oranges . 
  yes . 
  i do n't know what exactly slovenia is doing , but whatever they are doing they must be doing right . 
  on all these maps that show economic/prosperity indicators across europe , slovenia always looks like it belongs with the rest of ` old europe ' not the former soviet block countries let alone the rest of ex-yugoslavia . 
  the only indication i have of why that may be so is that apparently my refrigerator comes from there , otherwise i have no idea . 
  i wonder why that is . 
  better public transportation ?
