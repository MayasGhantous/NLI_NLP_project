  more stay at home moms ( and dads ) without their own cars ? 
  larger families ? 
  older generations not as likely to drive ? 
  younger people not as likely to have a car ( commuting vs dorm based colleges ) ? 
  anyone have an idea ? 
  despite the obvious issue of `` what counts as a vehicle '' and `` this is not normalized for age structure '' this still seems to be a good indicator of prosperity . 
  still a statistic of cars per people old enough to get a driving license would probably be better . 
  many of them are young and probably still live with family . 
  to be fair this is not a unique feature of the british public . 
  almost all people everywhere will have trouble correctly estimating statistics of any sort . 
  the only way to keep from making wildly wrong claims when asked to guess at statistics is to either already know the answer or have an understating of numbers and the ability to do some quick mental arithmetic and some quick sanity checks . 
  this is a lot harder than it sounds . 
  want to make an experiment ? 
  guess about the percentage of people in the us who have the last name '' ** smith ** '' . 
  obviously you will know that it is a very common and perhaps you might even know that it is the most common surname in the us . 
  [ the answer might surprise you . 
  ] ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=percentage+of+people+named+smith ) this should have been easy to estimate simply based on your own experiences . 
  you could have just made a quick estimate of the number of people named smith you personally know and the total number of acquaintances whose last name you know . 
  even without math you should be able to get a close answer based simply on ` feelings ' . 
  now if you have to make an answer that you ca n't get at from personal experience things get even harder . 
  you have to base your estimate on second hand knowledge and if you go by ` feelings ' you will end up basing your guess on how often you hear about things like that . 
  since the news is far more likely to report `` man bites dog '' rather than `` dog bites man '' type of stories , you will for example end up thinking that men biting dogs are far more frequent than they really are . 
  the numbers here are more or less meaningless . 
  i expect there to be at least some correlation with the change in energy use . 
  if the number had been normalized for that they would probably look different . 
  there is also the lack of absolute values to indicate the starting point . 
  i think american 's sometimes say `` looks european '' to mean `` looks gay '' . 
  i think the part about the ` average ' income can be misleading too since in countries with a large wealth gap average is not really a useful statistic . 
  then there is of course the fact that in some countries certain things are paid for via tax that in other countries are paid for in other ways ( or lacking entirely which also brings some costs to the individual with it . ), 
  well , what sort of industry is there in places like the canaries and reunion other than tourism ? 
  i expect that isolation and the added transportation costs for everything coming from and to the areas will probably make them a bad place for many industries . 
  in case anyone was wondering [ this appears to the source for that article ( warning pdf ) . 
  ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/1-15042014-bp/en/1-15042014-bp-en.pdf ) here are the top ten region with lowest : 1 . 
  t\u00fcbingen ( de ) ** 3.0 % ** 4 . 
  tirol ( at ) ** 3.0 % ** 6 . 
  trier ( de ) ** 3.1 % ** 9 . 
  schwaben ( de ) ** 3.3 % ** and highest unemployment : 1 . 
  dytiki makedonia ( el ) ** 31.8 % ** 7 . 
  kentriki makedonia ( el ) ** 30.0 % ** 9 . 
  r\u00e9union ( fr ) ** 28.9 % ** * ( reddit does n't allow for ties in numbered lists ) * for me the suprise was * praha * . 
  i am not familiar with the region . 
  can someone enlighten me what is going on there ? 
  yes , but in many of these countries where everyone and their brother has gone to college , a degree is probably worth less than a journeyman 's certificate or a mastery is in the countries with lower number of degrees . 
  it is just a sign that apprenticeships still are a valid career path and that you do n't need to have gone to university for every type of job . 
  i do n't think organized crime has much effect on statistics such as these . 
  this appears to be mostly a map showing poverty , population density and the divide between [ cultures of honour vs. cultures of law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honour#cultures_of_honour_and_cultures_of_law ) . 
  usually crime rates are higher in cities than in the country , but in regions where there is large emphasis on personal and family honour and reputation that tends to be more prominent in rural than in urban areas . 
  with the far north you might also have to take into account the very real psychological effect of prolonged lack of sunlight . 
  that map looks suspiciously like it might be heavily correlated to population density . 
  the europe wide map probably has to large areas for the correlation to become as apparent and the normal difference between urban and rural areas that you normally seem in crime statistics get overshadowed by other factors such as prosperity/poverty . 
  which leads to effects like the densely populated metropolis of berlin being lighter shaded than the surrounding brandenburg . 
  the different shades of light blue are not exactly easy to tell apart . 
  the map only uses 5 different colours . 
  would it have been to much to ask for them using 5 colour that you can tell apart at a glance ? 
  the christian science monitor is not really all that closely connected to the christian scientist sect anymore and actually as actual journalism goes they are probably amongst the best the us still has to offer . 
   which shows they a ) knew that russia had invaded a neighbouring country , and b ) where russia was . 
  which is something . 
  which makes it even more curious that some people would point at the falklands or iceland or madgascar . 
  even if you do n't know where russland is you would have to realize that those are islands without any land borders to invade through . 
  of course picking an obvious landlocked country like mongolia or switzerland , when it has been reported up and down the news that russia wants the crimean peninsula for it strategic ports has its own set of problems . 
  the fact that most of the misclicks where somewhere in the centre of an actual country ( or in many cases in the middle of the black sea ) shows that they were not just clicking at random . 
  some of them very deliberately and precisely clicked the middle of france after all . 
  they were obviously trying . 
  i think many of them simply had o idea how to read a map at all . 
  i think the table shows that the us is the only country where less than 90 % of the 18-24 year olds can identify their own country on a map . 
  also whoever made that table appears to be under the impression that the pacific ocean is a country . 
  well anyone who successfully fled east germany was welcomed in west germany with some welcome money and allowed to stay , but i guess that was a special case as ( if i recall correctly ) west germany had a definition of citizenship that sort of included east germany , so they were n't really viewed as foreigners wanting asylum . 
   the candidates [ ... ] will answer questions from thousands of young people all over europe . 
  why only young people ? 
  for that matter : how only young people ? 
  did they get their questions from some internet forum or website and decided that only young people use the internet or something like that ? 
  how do you make a carpet out of brussels and belgium ? 
  just kidding . 
  it looks like a nice persian . 
  please keep in mind that those are labour costs not wages . 
  the wages themselves would have to be adjusted for buying power since lots of stuff stuff is more expensive in norway than it is in bulgaria . 
  the difference between what the average bulgarian can buy and what the average norwegian can buy with their wages is not quite as big as the difference between the labour costs in the two countries but still quite substantial . 
  i would expect that this is no less true for germany etc than for the uk , so i guess there has to be more to it . 
  labour costs in the uk are ( compared to france and germany or even ireland ) a lot lower than i would have thought . 
  what is going on there ? 
  is this some artefact of calculating health care costs differently or something real ? 
  bulgaria is cheapest , but rapidly catching up . 
  the difference between change in euro and in their own currency is striking for some countries like poland . 
  labour costs more z\u0142oty but the euro costs remains the same . 
  it would be interesting how this relates to average wages and the buying power of those wages . 
  yes it was only completely abolished in 2011 . 
  it is curious how well this correlates with maps of economic prosperity . 
  the poorest countries with the highest unemployment appear to be the most religious . 
  actually the gypsies were the old jews too . 
  the have been persecuted for a long time and during the holocaust they were targeted alongside the jews and others . 
  depending on how you want to count these things and what numbers you pick and choose roma and sinti had a larger percentage of their population wiped out than jews in much of europe during the nazi holocaust . 
  but despite that it is know as the holocaust not the porajmos and many people today have no qualms displaying basically the same prejudices about gypsies they used to have a century ago while most would never do the same towards jews . 
  if esa wants to continue to do human space flight , but does n't want to invest the sort of money necessary to actually have human space flight capability of their own , partnering with russia is more or less their only choice . 
  well in theory there are also the chinese , but that seems unlikely . 
  i think i see a trend here ... 
  but seriously , every country sees themselves as the most compassionate and everyone but the czech and the italians see themselves as the least arrogant . 
  so everyone has a high opinion of themselves . 
  the french and british do n't think too highly of each other . 
  they also appear to be of everyone 's else radar except for each other and germany in one case . 
  germany is seen as the most trustworthy by all but greece , arrogant by all but the british , french and themselves and lacking in compassion by all but france and themselves .
