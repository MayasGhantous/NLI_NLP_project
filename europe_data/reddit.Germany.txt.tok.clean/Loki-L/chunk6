  or as if there was a realistic hope of the peace-talks themselves actually being productive . 
  the parts about no one being able see them or guess them seem like they are slowly getting less and less true . 
  lots of people from google to the nsa put a lot of work into modelling the way people think and react . 
  if not always on an individual level than with amazing accuracy on a larger scale . 
  people get bunched together into focus groups or classifed as threats and when real money comes into play certain groups and people can predict what you will think and do with amazing accuracy . 
  and it is not just about mind reading . 
  they can influence your thoughts too and that is not a new thing . 
  if they can convince you that an overpriced , bloodsaoked piece of coal is traditional romantic or forever they can convince you of everything . 
  freedom of thought is a nice thought but it probably is n't entirely true in a world where your thoughts are no longer your own and the idea of thoughtcriem is far more than just a nightmare . 
  who was the guy who introduced him ? 
  he seemed familiar but i ca n't place him . 
  also in case anyone was wondering here are the correct lyrics :  o freunde , nicht diese t\u00f6ne !, 
  a quick google seach seems to inidicate that it is at least no unique : http://dailycaller.com/2013/05/07/british-lawmakers-demand-cheaper-alcohol-at-parliamentary-bars/ i do n't know about the german bundestag but former foreign minister joschka fischer once famously described the german parliament as an unbelievable gathering of alcoholics ( unglaubliche alkoholikerversammlung ) . 
  i believe that german industry might elect to not take them at their word and in the future avoid things like microsoft 's azure clouds . 
  seriously german medium sized business that compete on an international level can be somewhat paranoid about their data security as it is . 
  quite often the know-how is the only thing that keeps them ahead of the cheaper asian competition so they have reason to be worried . 
  the fact that contractors hired by the us government have access to this valuable data , but promise not to share it with the wrong people wo n't actually reassure all that many people . 
  somebody help me out here : do all the countries on the map elect their head of government in the same election as their parliament ? 
  i do n't think the results of this survey accurately reflect the actual reality in question . 
  i would add that it [ was posted here 8 days ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hhpsk/the_european_union_explained_video/ ) and user / u/mindofmetalandwheels who made it commented in that thread . 
  obama said he would n't be scrambling jets . 
  he never said he would n't have european nations scramble their jets . 
  i think in light of this graph the shift from bonn to berlin might have been a mistake . 
  too bad it wo n't work that way . 
  there are lots of other factors involved beyond just ram and storage . 
  they range from the performance of various components to things like uptime guarantees , quality of support and such externalities as the physical location of the server ( lots of businesses will be willing to pay more for hosting on non nsa-accessible datacenters . ), 
  computing is far from being the commodity everyone makes it out to be and treating it as such will only result in disaster as people go with the cheapest available option regardless of consequences . 
  wikipedia has this lovely and up-to-date euler diagram of the eu , the eurozone , schengen , the council of europe , the customs area , efta and cefta . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/supranational_european_bodies-en.svg i think they should have tried to squeeze in members of uefa , esa and possibly eurovison . 
  they probably would consider a lot of things they do to others an act of war . 
  imagine if some other country flee drones over the us bombing random weddings etc. 
  it is not about democracy . 
  it is about not being able to make up your mind . 
  either you are in or your are out . 
  this wishy washy stuff where you are in with one foot but do n't really want to participate fully , but still want to have a major say in how things are done is n't really working . 
  the eu does n't even properly stretch all the way to england thanks to obstructionist british . 
  i am not sure whether i want a country that ca n't really decide if wants to bes part of europe or not , decide how far europe goes . 
  as for kazakhstan i think we should try baby steps first . 
  they already managed to join uefa in 2002 . 
  the next logical step would be to participate in the eurovison song contest . 
  i am not even sure if a high absorption rate is good or bad . 
  what happens to funds that are allocated but not absorbed ? 
  what causes funds to be not absorbed ? 
  without a lot of context these numbers are n't really all that helpful . 
  theoretically in school , but i think the real breakthrough came when i discovered an english comic in a train-station book-store ( this was before comic shops where common ) . 
  the comic was a reprint ( classic x-men ) of a comic that i had already read a german translation of so i had a good idea what was going on . 
  after some time i had quite an extensive comic collection and began to graduate to books ( mostly sci-fi and fantasy ) . 
  the more time i spent reading and watching videos in the original english , the less satisfied i became with the translation efforts . 
  by the time i started university amazon and the internet were already a big thing and i got into the habit of never going with the translated version of a book or movie if i could get my hands on the english original . 
  i have tried to replicate this success of learning a language by immersing myself in it , but have n't succeeded . 
  i think it is a combination of having to little time and simply being too old to easily learn another language . 
  i think it never got of the ground because it was a choice between 2ton and stereo ( at least before things went digital ) . 
  i guess it would be highly inappropriate to start quoting tarkin from star wars at this point ? 
  with words like that i usually just write a general approximation of what it sounds like and let the spellchecker work things out . 
  if i do n't have a spellchecker i write `` gledbeutel '' . 
  i have pretty much given up the fight against the duden and its rules . 
  if she seeks answers she should just email her questions to herself . 
  the relevant groups will take not and get back to her on the topic . 
  they probably use different measurements . 
  the one is the table is derived from 3 million internet users ( people who have used the internet in some form in the last 12 months ) and a total population of 7.3 million . 
  this table might have been the source : [ list of countries by number of internet users ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_internet_users ) if you sort by percentage you get something like this : * iceland 95.02 * norway 93.97 * netherlands 92.30 * sweden 91.00 * luxembourg 90.89 * denmark 90.00 * finland 89.37 * switzerland 85.20 * liechtenstein 85.00 * guernsey 83.63 * germany 83.00 * united kingdom 82.00 * andorra 81.00 * faroe islands 80.73 * austria 79.80 * france 79.58 * belgium 78.00 * ireland 76.82 * estonia 76.50 * monaco 75.00 * slovakia 74.44 * czech republic 72.97 * slovenia 72.00 * latvia 71.68 * croatia 70.71 * malta 69.22 * spain 67.60 * lithuania 65.05 * gibraltar 65.00 * poland 64.88 * bosnia and herzegovina 60.00 * hungary 59.00 * cyprus 57.68 * italy 56.80 * macedonia 56.70 * portugal 55.30 * greece 53.00 * bulgaria 51.00 * san marino 49.60 * albania 49.00 * russia 49.00 * romania 44.02 * serbia 42.20 * turkey 42.10 * montenegro 40.00 * belarus 39.60 * jersey 36.00 * ukraine 30.60, 
  i was a bit confused about the part where we had to give our religion and rate how important our religion was to us . 
  i put in atheist and felt at a loss at how to quantify that . 
  i ended up convincing myself that i felt very strongly about not believing at all , but that was the sort of thing that could have phrased better . 
  i also felt a bit confused that jedi appeared as a political ideology and not a religion . 
  i thought the inclusion of the uk was some sort of trick question to see if you were actually paying attention or something . 
  to make matters worse , highly qualified people who emigrate from countries like spain to places like germany apparently often end up with jobs ( if they end up with jobs at all ) that they are very overqualified for . 
  this means that actual skills atrophy due to disuse and not keeping up with the latest industry trends . 
  when they get back home their skills sometime literally have been drained away . 
  not to mention the fact that by paying 1.4 billion even only a year later you can have the money work for you in the meantime and make much more than the fine was for . 
  nope that is a [ european long-distance path ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_long-distance_paths ) which is something different from the [ e-road network ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_e-road_network ) . 
  they are both labelled with an e followed by a number but the roads have a leading zero for single digit numbers and the path only number in the single digits . 
  - ** [ e01 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_route_e01 ) ** is road that goes from larne ( in northern ireland ) to seville ( spain ) - ** [ e1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e1_european_long_distance_path ) ** is a footpath that goes from norway to italy for some reason wikipedia has the link for the missing road ** e02 ** got to the path ** e2 **, 
  does anyone know why there is no ** e-02 ** ? 
  not for longer than 24 hours at least . 
  i do n't know how comparable these numbers really . 
  for one thing each country has slightly different definitions of what a police officer is and what they do . 
  are for example the carabinierie and gendamerie counted as military or police ? 
  what about traffic wardens or dog catchers ? 
  at what point do they count officers in training ? 
  another problem is that the police in many european countries is a prime example of in effective mismanagement and bureaucracy run amok . 
  just because there are a certain number of police officers does not say anything about how many of them actually do any meaningful work . 
  another important aspect are questions of scale . 
  a very small country will likely have higher numbers than larger numbers with the same level of ` service ' because they have a certain amount of inescapable overhead . 
  a much better indicator might perhaps have been the amount of man hours actually spent on patrol . 
  i think the bbc is paid for by tv licenses . 
  how exactly is ert paid for ? 
  anybody have any idea what is up with that ? 
  it seems there are plenty of employment opportunities for qualified workers from southern europe in germany and the situation in places like spain and greece has n't really improved , so why are so many of them leaving again after a short time ? 
  actually the real sad thing is that despite everything that happened in europe in the 20th century , from auschwitz to the battle of verdun and anything around and in between . 
  that was actually one of the most peaceful episodes and areas in human history . 
  if you only look at the chances of a human being to come to harm or death due to violence from another human being , the 20th century worldwide was probably the best century we ever had . 
  in a way that is extremely disheartening to realize what bastards humans actually are and despite the presence of the largest most shameful and senseless acts of mass murder and slaughter in history , on average what came before was arguably worse only less organized and directed . 
  on the other hand the fact that we have managed to avoid major bloodshed on this scale hence and have arguably become even more peaceful seems like something that one might be optimistic about . 
  no , i have played civilization a lot and the maps look totally different . 
  i am sure they will find a way around that too . 
  the german telekom has been very adamant that their own streaming media offering is in now way competing with other streaming services on the net that they would like to cap and throttle . 
  i am sure lawyers will have fun with this , but do n't expect much benefit for consumers . 
  what exactly is the context here ? 
  is that just a map based of a geoip table ?
