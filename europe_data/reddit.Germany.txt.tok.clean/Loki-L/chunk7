  because those are n't really accurate . 
  the adds that use them always tell me that there are nice women looking for companionship some place about 40 km away . 
  it also is n't really an accurate representation of density as different ips have more or less public ip addresses and share them differently via natting . 
  at best this is a list of nominal locations of telco 's dial in nodes weighted by the amount of public ips the telco owns . 
  i think someone in another thread where this image was posted already clarified that this is actually a picture from austria not germany . 
  i think the rather sloppy way those sand sacks are stacked and the way his lawn mower lanes are not even close to being parallel should be considered a hint . 
  edited to add : google image search says this is a reuters image from last wednesday from the village of stein-krems . 
  to be fair , when you stumble upon a german word in a philosophy text , its meaning tends to be only very tangentially connected to the actual meaning of the word as native speaker with no background in philosophy would understand it . 
  they are the result form german philosophers slapping a label in their native tongue on a complicated concept and not from that concept existing natively in that language . 
  edit : this does not mean that i disagree with your general point . 
  there are some very interesting experiments and anecdotes about the way that our language shapes our abilities to comprehend and think . 
  like the fact that for example our ability to distinguish different colours not shown to us at the same time depends on us being able to name them . 
  we might be able to tell two shades of blue apart when shown at the same time or shortly after another , but not if there is a pause between , when we ca n't give them different labels . 
  another interesting anecdote i heard concerned some tribe that had no native words for relative directions only absolute ones . 
  they had words for east and west but not for left and right . 
  subsequently they had a sense of direction that surpasses everyone else 's . 
  a different way of talking about things might often lead to a different way of thinking about things . 
  ca n't you still vote in british elections as a briton living abroad ? 
  if you voted both in the country where you held citizenship and the country where you lived that would give you one more vote than people who are citizens of the land they lived in . 
  what got me was that these supermarkets were open at 3 o'clock in the morning and weekends and whenever . 
  i think most of could probably point new zealand out on a map with some degree of accuracy . 
  other than the filming of the lord of the rings and the recent megaupload thing you guys do n't feature much in the news and appear to be fairly non-controversial . 
  older people might remember things like the rainbow warrior and might draw some parallels to the megaupload thing and your ( in - ) ability to stand up the bigger guys , but that is about as far as it gets . 
  there are no real stereotypes or prejudices that i am aware of . 
  i am reliably informed that you have lots of sheep , which i suppose is nice . 
  it is nice to see that the uk is investing in space flight at all these days . 
  if you look at old sci-fi stories and comics like dan dare you saw all these dreams of the uk becoming a serious contender in the space race next to the us and russia . 
  the actual result were less inspiring , no real space program and no british astronauts until a few guys went up as space tourists paying their own way or with dual citizenship and the support of other governments . 
  hopefully they will soon increase their contributions . 
  this sort of stuff is the stuff dreams are made of after all any money invested will pay of eventually . 
  i do n't doubt that chris hadfield 's activities on the iss and the publicity around it will have a measurable effect on the number of boys and girls who chose careers in science and engineering in canada . 
  the esa is well worth europe spends on it and pays its dividends in inspiration for the future . 
  maybe the bahn should focus their efforts elsewhere , like for example trying to make their trains run on time , i think there is some room for improvement there . 
  i do n't really care for graffiti on the outside of trains . 
  as long as the trains still run and preferably on time they can paint whatever they want on them . 
  but if we are talking about vandals who destroy the interiors of the train jam the doors or in other forms cause delays they have my full support to outfit their little helicopters with harpoon guns , to stop this sort of thing . 
  as long as they are investing in stuff they might look into hiring a meteorologist . 
  i have a feeling that it might snow in the coming winter , if they hire an expert who could lend some more weight to my unprofessional suspicion they might actually prepare for snowfall and not act all surprised the next time it happens ... 
  to be fair , from watching the news i get the impression that french people do n't actually need much of a reason to stage massive protests . 
  for all i know they had an equally massive protest about the unseasonal weather or the price of butter last week . 
  the map suffers from many defects . 
  similar shades for adjectant regions makes it impossible to tell what is supposed to be what unless you already can guess that they speak german in germany and french in france , but then you would n't need the legend anyway . 
  shading regions to show how language mixes in border regions and how minority languages are mixed in with majorities might have been better too . 
  one thing i liked was how the legend tried to group languages together by families , you have indo-european , uralic etc and then you have somewhere in the middle basque out of nowhere . 
  as sir humphrey explains : ** sir humphrey ** : minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
  ** hacker ** : that 's all ancient history , surely ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : yes , and current policy . 
  we ` had ' to break the whole thing [ the eec ] up , so we had to get inside . 
  we tried to break it up from the outside , but that would n't work . 
  now that we 're inside we can make a complete pig 's breakfast of the whole thing : set the germans against the french , the french against the italians , the italians against the dutch . 
  the foreign office is terribly pleased ; it 's just like old times . 
  hacker : but surely we 're all committed to the european ideal ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : [ chuckles ] really , minister . 
  ** hacker ** : if not , why are we pushing for an increase in the membership ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : well , for the same reason . 
  it 's just like the united nations , in fact ; the more members it has , the more arguments it can stir up , the more futile and impotent it becomes . 
  ** hacker ** : what appalling cynicism . 
  ** sir humphrey ** : yes ... we call it diplomacy , minister . 
  we had a common enemy in the uk . 
  the nazi-germany makes more sense for the 30s . 
  i assume the guy with the rf on the hat is france . 
  anybody with more knowledge of european history knows what incarnation of france it would represent ? 
  even if it meant moving out of their mother 's home and having to the laundry , the dishes and the cooking themselves ? 
  til, 
  ha , ha !, 
  your comedians will all be regulated down to the level of german humor , for standardization sake . 
  jokes and sketches will be measured and tested for funnines and categorized acordingly . 
  no one will have an unfair advantage through actually being able to make people laugh . 
  that makes more sense . 
  why put things like rate in there is they only mean a simple change . 
  i was bout to break out my rusty calculus skills to make sense of these . 
  i was thinking stuff like `` change in the rate of growth '' when they simply meant `` change '' . 
  i am sure that if you petition your lawmakers nicely you too can get a meaningless piece of paper that wo n't actually make a difference . 
  wait , is this the change in the rate of growth or the change in actual growth or what ? 
  are we talking 2nd derivative here ? 
  if i understand this correctly , the negative entries do n't mean that the gdp has been shrinking or that it has stopped growing , but that the rate at which the growth has been increasing has gone down . 
  or is it that the rate of acceleration has gone down or something like that ? 
  are we driving backwards , slowing down , slowing down the rate at which we are accelerating or slowing down the rate at which our acceleration has been increasing ? 
  thankfully no longer unemployed , but i used to live on hartz iv , the lowest level of government welfare in germany , a few years ago . 
  while lots of people love to complain about the level of financial and other support i actually found it quite luxurious . 
  they paid my rent , health insurance and pension insurance and lots of minor other things and left me with enough money to afford groceries etc. 
  i got by and eventually mostly through my own efforts and not any of the overworked case workers well-meant but misplaced assistance ( a forklift license wo n't help me find employment in the it sector ) i got out . 
  i understand that for someone with children it can be different , but the worst problems i saw at the fellows standing in line with me was that most of them had a very wrong attitude about the whole thing . 
  the worst part was the loss of self-worth you experienced . 
  eventually even though i did not have any more money left over and a lot less free time the first job i took afterwards was a godsent . 
  you do n't realize how soul-crushing the situation is you are in until you manage to get out . 
  it was a very good feeling . 
  today i still have this experience in the back of my mind and i sleep easier knowing that no matter how bad things might get i will get by . 
  if i lost my job tomorrow i would survive . 
  i have seen the worst that could happen employment wise and it was not that bad . 
  this can be incredibly liberating . 
  it also make the taxes i pay slightly easier to stomach . 
  i think it is a very british problem . 
  there are lots of muslims in germany for example too , but for the vast majority of them their religion is not really a big problem . 
  muslims in the uk are apparently far more radicalised than in other parts of europe . 
  not all muslims are anywhere near the same and the grandchild of turkish immigrants in germany tends to have a different attitude towards their religion than the average british muslim . 
  it would be a very bad idea to try to generalize ideas and observations about this sort of thing from one place in europe to another .
