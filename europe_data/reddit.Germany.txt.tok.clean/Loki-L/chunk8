  notice how rwanda is actually a lighter more tolerant shade of red than india on this map . 
  i do n't doubt that indians are racists , but i do n't think that hutu and tutsi live in greater ethnic harmony and tolerance in rwanda than people in india . 
  it would be interesting what the other options were in the survey . 
  people with a different religion , people of a different economic status , people who play music very loudly after hours ... 
  personally , i do n't think that as an adult i have ever been in any situation where i thought `` i wish i had a gun now . '', 
  or `` i wish everyone around me could carry around a gun with them if they wanted too . '', 
  part of that is probably because of the relatively low crime rate where i live and the sheer implausibility of ever being in a situation where a gun would improve the situation , part of that is being daily surrounded by people who i am not entirely sure should be entrusted with something as dangerous as wooden currywurst forks let alone something more dangerous . 
  sure if somehow fascism reared its ugly head i might change my tune and go all article 20 paragraph 4 on them , but for now things are not in need of improvement . 
  i thought this would basically map really well to a map of population density , but it does not seem to work quite as well as i thought : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/densit\u00e9_de_population_en_france_m\u00e9tropolitaine_en_2009_par_commune.svg, 
  * `` crimes against the nation '' * sounds extremely bad to my ears . 
  maybe it is an translation problem , but the concepts behind such a term really do n't sit well with me . 
  there are some of these stones in the street where i live . 
  most of the time people do n't even notice them , but every now and then you look down and see them and it hits home a bit . 
  some people do n't like them because it causes passerbys to essentially walk over these markers in what they consider a disrespectful manner . 
  i think they are quite ingenious . 
  they are extremely robust , do n't require any maintenance or upkeep are n't easily vandalised and because of their minimalist way there is nothing in their content that anybody could argue about . 
  are those supposed to be ices ? 
  i did n't think they would be suitable for this sort of thing or that there would be any high-speed rail links that would connect up to this tunnel . 
  1 ) the flag does not exclusively represent the eu but also officially represents the coe as well as officially any number of european integration efforts and organisations . 
  2 ) out of the entire population of the continent of europe the majority reside in countries that are european union members . 
  furthermore ( without any hard data to back it up ) i would wager that eu members are actually overrepresented among english speaking european redditors , since at least the eastern european non-eu countries tend to have less access to the internet and less english language proficiency . 
  so the flag does include almost everyone and the label `` eu '' includes the majority of those europeans here in this subreddit . 
  the fact that you do n't support the eu does n't negate the fact that you are in it or that most news about europe ( as opposed to news about countries in europe ) will involve the eu in some way . 
  in japanese the kanji used for garmany has a meaning of auto - , alone , by itself . 
  the kanji use for france means buddha . 
  make of that what you will . 
  and as i recall i think , we both kind o ' liked it, 
  exactly . 
  well it was either that or breakfast at tiffany 's . 
  elsa\u00df-lothringen perhaps ? 
  i doubt it . 
  even the coins from small countries or the commemorative coins are far too common . 
  you would probably need special collector sets directly from the mints or pay attention to the year of minting or something to get anything of worth . 
  i am still setting aside any special coins i find , just for the sheer childish fun of it . 
  this is something that many people often forgot when talking about the introduction of the euro . 
  it was distinct from the introduction of the new coins and notes . 
  by the time most of us had the new money in their hand for the first time , exchange rates had already been fixed for some time and accounts may have been in the new currency long before the physical money was available . 
  when the coins and notes were distributed to the public it was mostly just a symbolic step unless you wanted to pay with them abroad . 
  the official conversion rate was 1.95583 to 1 , but almost everyone immediately adopted a conversion rate of 2 to 1 in their heads for easier calculation . 
  of course some retailers were not satisfied with that small price increase and tried to increase prices beyond this rounding error . 
  this was not popular . 
  other were a bit smarter and changed the size of packages at the same time to make it harder to compare . 
  the real strange thing is hearing some people sometimes even now saying things like `` 100 euro ? 
  that 's like 200 marks ! '', 
  i still put aside ` foreign ' coins every time i get one in change that i have never had before . 
  i expect that my extensive but incomplete ` collection ' is still worth exactly face value at this point , but i still get excited everytime i get a coin i do n't immediately recognize . 
  i always thought kurds were more likely to be blond than turks and expected to see a lighter splot on the map where all the kurds live . 
  i wonder how accurate the map is in the eastern turkey , iraq area . 
  i would have thought that among kurds blonde hair was more common than with their neighbours . 
  i was n't talking about being a monarch , but having one . 
  what 's the use of having expensive royalty if you do n't do fun royalty stuff with them ? 
  it is like having an expensive sport car and then not driving it to avoid wear and tear and because of high gas prices . 
  this just takes all the fun out of having a king in the fist place . 
  interesting . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown_of_the_netherlands ) seems to say there is a crown but that it is n't worn . 
  [ nl.wikipedia ] ( http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/koningskroon ) seems to go more in depth . 
  anybody in the know care to enlighten us what is up with the crown ? 
  you probably would be hard pressed to find an actor or performer better suited for the job than someone who has literally been born for it and practically trained since birth . 
  why no crown for the king in this picture ? 
  which should also lower the reported crime statistics as the police largely does n't get involved and most disagreements are handled by the local without involvement of the system . 
  this part at the end was the bit that got me :  the court granted one request by poeteray : it ordered the return of five of his watches seized during the investigation , branded as an omega , a graham , a breitling , a bulgari , and a corum . 
  all were fakes .

  fewer kids is usually one of the most reliable indicators of things like increased prosperity etc. 
  i was expecting more of a kinf of sitcom like setip where they were all roommates or something . 
  they all lived in what was a cultural capital of the world at the time . 
  i am sure you could make list of very influential people of a more recent era who lived all live in new york at some point . 
  i think the apprenticeship model in germany is in many ways a lot fairer than the internships in the us . 
  with the apprentice system you actually are sort of guaranteed to get some provable skills out of the deal and a nifty certificate that says that you now know what you are doing . 
  apprentices who go to to school and learn relevant skills there half the time still earn money for their work on the job . 
  university is not for everyone and by pretending that it is we are doing nobody a favour . 
  this is not repeat of the 13th to 17th century ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : minister , britain has had the same foreign policy objective for at least the last five hundred years : to create a disunited europe . 
  in that cause we have fought with the dutch against the spanish , with the germans against the french , with the french and italians against the germans , and with the french against the germans and italians . 
  divide and rule , you see . 
  why should we change now , when it 's worked so well ? 
  ** hacker ** : that 's all ancient history , surely ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : yes , and current policy . 
  we ` had ' to break the whole thing up , so we had to get inside . 
  we tried to break it up from the outside , but that would n't work . 
  now that we 're inside we can make a complete pig 's breakfast of the whole thing : set the germans against the french , the french against the italians , the italians against the dutch . 
  the foreign office is terribly pleased ; it 's just like old times . 
  ** hacker ** : but surely we 're all committed to the european ideal ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : [ chuckles ] really , minister . 
  ** hacker ** : if not , why are we pushing for an increase in the membership ? 
  ** sir humphrey ** : well , for the same reason . 
  it 's just like the united nations , in fact ; the more members it has , the more arguments it can stir up , the more futile and impotent it becomes . 
  ** hacker ** : what appalling cynicism . 
  ** sir humphrey ** : yes ... we call it diplomacy , minister . 
  actually there is not much joikng here . 
  this seems rather true . 
  higher interest usually means higher risk . 
  you ca n't normally get a high return for your investment without taking some risks . 
  i always thought of it as a sort of replay of the german unification on a grander scale . 
  i present you this relevant magzine article : [ a statement followed by a question separated by a colon : an effective journalistic technique ? 
  ] ( http://www.theonion.com/articles/a-statement-followed-by-a-question-separated-by-a,10382/ ) do n't worry since it is the onion magazine there is no article summarize , just the cover . 
  part of it is the laws that actually protect renters quite a lot . 
  there are fewer reasons against renting .
