  another thing is cultural . 
  in germany traditionally when people think of owning or building their own home , they think `` bausparvertrag '' not mortage . 
  i think the problem is that everyone calls germany something different and using an abbreviation like ger would make even less sense to non-english speakers than de . 
  you might as well complain that chemical symbols do n't always match up with the english names of elements . 
  using the names of the countries in their own languages as a base to create the iso codes at least makes some sense . 
  which makes sense since everyone knows they have no homeless people in the us itself . 
  but knowing that something suffered for it makes the whole thing so much more sexier . 
  it is the same thing with fur or leather or blood diamonds or lots of other stuff . 
  violence and power are aphrodisiacs after all . 
  it looks sort of like some sort of deformed tumorous version of the familiar map . 
  parts look bloated and just about to bust while others look dried up and atrophied . 
  overall the visual effect is rather unhealthy i vote that for aesthetic reasons alone we need to spread ourselves more evenly across the continent . 
  so , who wants to move the fjords ? 
  i was going to point out how most of them are white , but then i realized that there were more black guys in there than ones without glasses . 
  i bet the rest of them wear contacts too . 
  seriously there is some sort of bespectacled conspiracy going on here with bifocal wearers being secretly in control of the world . 
  i am not catholic but i wear glasses so i guess i should be part of the conspiracy , where do i sign up , the nearest fielmann ? 
  yes , the article does not go out of its way to adequately portray the protesters motivations . 
  either they have some real reasons and the article just does not give them or they are completely without any legitimate environmental reasons and more motivated by financial considerations such as losing business on the alpine road . 
  [ just for comparison sake a bar graph with the height of the bars representing the gdp ] ( http://imgur.com/wgb1l63 ), 
  please note that it is the area of the circles not their diameter that represents the gdp . 
  if this picture had been done as a bar graph it would have looked a lot more uneven with the ` large ' countries looking much larger than the smaller ones . 
  on the other hand , if you had wanted to make them even look even close you could have gone with a 3d graph containing actual balls or spheres and had the their volume represent the gdp . 
  in the picture it looks like the ball representing germany is about 3 or 4 times larger than the one of greece , but in reality it represents a number 13 times larger than the greek one . 
  statistics and graphs are nice , but one has to know how to read them for them to be useful . 
  i think this time the yes men have gone to far with their prank press conferences . 
  imagine the cost . 
  russia is just too poor , too corrupt and too different at this point . 
  turkey is more european that russia . 
  i think if we wanted land mass that badly it would be cheaper in euro per km \u00b2 to have the dutch drain the north sea instead . 
  * edited because `` too '' not `` to '', 
  it seems strange that germany is perhaps europe 's and the world 's leader in photovoltaics , but is actually such a bad location for it . 
  from the point of view of an integrated europe it would make far more sense to build all these solar farms in the mediterranean than in the north . 
  sure there is still the problem of the energy not being produced in the places that it is needed , but until more efficient ways are found to transfer electricity maybe we could also shift some energy intensive industries to where the sun shines . 
  i meant that the name is part of the style . 
  the fancy packaging of a product that marketing people tend to focus on more than the actual boring technical specs of what is inside . 
  they might prefer a name like peter more the same way they prefer a certain colour-scheme . 
   `` they just saw a foreign name and did n't open it . 
  the jobs ranged from really basic work to jobs within the ** marketing sector ** that i was highly qualified for . 
  it does n't make sense . '', 
  i think that might have been part of the problem . 
  he was looking for a job in an industry that by definition prises style over substance . 
  if he had more technical qualifications and was looking for a job in that area he might have had more luck . 
  i would love some context to these . 
  all google image search and google translate would turn up was something about ** involvement in a terrorist organization `` conspiracy of cells of fire '' ** , with no words on why the suspects look like they repeatedly fell down some stairs and had their mugshots retouched with what probably was a pirated copy of microsoft paint . 
  i know can only imagine how you feel . 
  a country with a population less than a tenth the size of your own must truly be beneath your notice . 
  [ where are you from again ? 
  ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28+population+of+germany+%2f+population+of+finland+%29+%2f+%28population+of+finland+%2f+population+of+malta%29 ), 
  [ it is easy to get excited about elections when your vote for stuff like the european parliament actually count ten times as much as the votes of other people .

  for the lazy : is red higher risk and is the risk having too much water , too little water or water that is too polluted ? 
  actually there are still [ 3 active and heavily subsidized black coal mines ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_steinkohle#steinkohlebergwerke ) in germany . 
  they are to be shut down in 2015 and 2018 . 
  several things : 1 . 
  i assume they mean average height of adult males . 
  i assume because it is not stated in the infographic . 
  this is not exactly the best way to represent this data . 
  you know what works well for representing and comparing height ? 
  bar graphs !, 
  height is strongly correlated with good health and childhood nutrition which in turn correlates with prosperity . 
  i did n't know that . 
  i guess i could have looked that up , but i just assumed instead . 
  my reasoning was that angola sounded like a place where people would be poor and that generally in places full of poor people money stretches a lot farther . 
  today i learned !, 
  i was surprised about the angola thing . 
  are there jobs there or is this more a question of cheaper costs of living and ease of emigration making it a cheap retirement destination ? 
  the movement within europe and the eu however does not surprise me all that much . 
  as european integration advances we will se more and more phenomena that commonly happen within a country happening across borders within an integrated europe . 
  every country has areas and regions where all the young educated people are leaving to go to places with better opportunities often leaving behind bran-drained villages of the doomed . 
  i expect to see things like this occurring more and more on larger scales now . 
  the full version of this poster inculding the legend is available from the eu website for free as a pdf : http://bookshop.europa.eu/is-bin/intershop.enfinity/wfs/eu-bookshop-site/en_gb/-/eur/viewpublication-start?publicationkey=kc7205500 [ preview ] ( http://imgur.com/msqzw0l ), 
  i think that as europe approaches the status of a federation the nature of the concept of nation states itself will change too . 
  thanks to globalization a sovereign nation today is a very different thing than it was 2 centuries ago and i expect it will be even more different 50 years from now . 
  global corporations demand a global infrastructure of laws and treaties to make money . 
  between the internet and hollywood cultural differences between peoples are lessening . 
  other factors also works towards the same direction . 
  technology connects people across borders . 
  i expect that a few decades from now europe will be further unified but borders will mean a lot less than they do today even outside the eu . 
  this probably the sort of welcome they had in mind when they described the iraq invasion and said `` they will throw flowers us and greet us as liberators . '', 
   i wonder what would happen in the reverse case - an english candidate with german roots who plays heavily on his german roots ? 
  based on past experience i would guess that they probably would get crowned king or queen . 
  relax everyone , i saved democracy !, 
  i saw this thread at 17:45 and was confused for a moment . 
  i searched for and cheeked the notice i had gotten in the mail weeks ago and saw that : yes , the election was today and it was open until 6 and the school where i was supposed to vote was only a few minutes away if you ran really fast . 
  at that point it was already 17:48 and i decided to put on my pants despite it being sunday . 
  i ran as fast as an out of shape nerd with untied shoelaces possibly could . 
  the fastest way of course was covered in snow , uphill and insufficiently lit , but knowing my responsibility i pushed on . 
  i arrived at the voting locale with minutes to spare to witness the officials declaring a bet among themselves as won . 
  seemingly i was the one person to reach the limit on the voter turnout during the last hour that they bet upon . 
  i was also the last voter . 
  anxiously i grabbed the ballot and went behind the screen . 
  i am reasonably sure that in all the excitement i actually made the x in the place i intended to and that i did n't accidentally vote for the party of bible loyal christ . 
  when i left the to place the church bells struck 6 and the elction was officially over . 
  so in closing thanks to reddit i managed to vote today . 
  i am not entirely sure who i voted for but they say it is the thought that counts . 
  the system works . 
  the people have spoken and they have no one to blame but themselves for what follows . 
  i sense the premise for a great heist movie here , perhaps even a franchise . 
  transporting gold from france to germany will probably be done by train so we have the set up for a * great train-robbery * .
