so good to see the left descending into irrelevance . 
  that 's a pretty cool bridge . 
  planning to explore the hungarian interpretation of `` big city life '' : budapest committed to experience the insanely hot weather during summer in `` feels like the mediterranean man '' cities : p\u00e9cs , szeged . 
  narrow alleys , historical buildings , vineyards , hills : eger . 
  that city punches above its weight , surprisingly good to visit as a tourist . 
  also lake balaton , but that is just as obvious as budapest . 
  you pick three . 
  summers can be very hot ( sometimes even going over 40 \u00b0 c ) , winters range from quite mild to pretty fucking cold ( worst case scenario is , say , -20 \u00b0 c , but that is quite rare , almost unheard of in the past years ) . 
  not a lot to say about spring and fall . 
  you should n't . 
  it 's too dull here . 
  i do n't think you should . 
  i have been banned for less couple of months ago . 
  e. no idea how this ended up as `` controversial '', 
  tbqf this entire `` london = special snowflake financial centre '' thing is slowly but surely becoming a meme . 
   second swedish empire is that a shorthand for the commonwealth of northern somalia ? 
  i 'm actually amazed that we are the only ones, 
  i thought he was in jail . 
  it is ( or `` was '' ) , but one can always hope it will descend into irrelevance . 
  with dublin on the map as well , you might have to stick to tulips , drug tourism and various kinds of cheese . 
  good . 
  - deals a major blow to eu ( sucks ) - map changes , drama coming soon ( great ) - england might be descending to irrelevance ( ambivalent ) - campaigns were hungary-level lame ( saying this as a hungarian ) - is it always like this ? 
  - to me , the message was , the majority of people do n't want central/eastern european immigration and prefer third world immigration , solely because muh commonwealth . 
  no [ well-done ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5wa65.jpg ) please !, 
  that was the optimistic scenario . 
  ... and loses scotland in the process, 
  really ? 
  i would have never guessed . 
  i do n't have a horse in this one , but '' ( ... ) 23rd be our independence day '' with the `` cock-sucking motion '' ( for the lack of a better phrase ) , was so cringeworthy . 
  saving for future reference, 
  well , what about northern ireland ? 
  it should be that way . 
  scotland gaining independence , london becoming a city state , both being in the eu . 
  rest of england becoming a transitional , `` mystery box '' economy for the upcoming decades , losing relevancy on the playing field . 
  yes . 
  look at his username, 
   user x complains about the unjustified stigmati ** s ** ation of right-wing opinions as far-right extremist   user x describes reality in another subreddit    `` that one right there is far right extremist '' to state the obvious : i 'm not emotionally invested in the german population planning , but i 'm still interested , how was that far-anything ? 
  i mean , you ca n't deny german head honchos are entertaining the idea of pushing inbreeding to the background ... 
  yeah , please do n't, 
  - there is a weird ass small town called swifts creek . 
  its swimming pool has the blocks from the 1956 melbourne olympics . 
  - alice springs has or had a several issue with alcoholics . 
  - a japanese terrorist / doomsday cult organization ( which was responsible for the tokyo metro sarin gas attack ) owned one of the largest sheep / cattle stations in australia . 
  ca n't recall the name . 
  - they have a pretty fucking [ good gin distillery ] ( http://www.goodfood.com.au/drinks/cocktails-spirits/australias-four-pillars-scores-world-championship-gin-win--again-20160323-gnonps ) , even though the country is not exactly a gin powerhouse . 
  - anything can kill you basically . 
  - melbourne , out of all possible cities , has the largest tram network of the world , by far . 
  no metro systems in the entire region though !, 
  - [ several insanely long fences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longest_fence_in_the_world ) . 
  according to some sources , there were cca . 
  70-80k people out there . 
  which is great , but i can only wonder how many have heard about ceu before the whole clusterfuck of the past few weeks has begun . 
  guess this is also one of the reasons why some people subscribe to the whole `` travel expenses paid by soros '' theory ( to state the obvious : i do not ) . 
  i suppose i agree with the `` fuck the government '' statement , but it is rather hard to take these protests seriously . 
  let the balkanization of uk begin !, 
   ada kaleh ( romanian pronunciation : [ \u02c8ada ka\u02c8le ] from turkish : adakale meaning `` island fortress '' , hungarian : \u00dajorsova or ada kaleh , serbian and bulgarian : \u0410\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435 / adakale ) was a small island on the danube populated mostly by turks ** that was submerged during the construction of the iron gates hydroelectric plant in 1970 . 
  ** the island was about 3 km downstream from or\u015fova and measured 1.75 by 0.4 -- 0.5 km . 
  that sucks . 
  but then again , you live in western europe . 
  i do n't want to be that guy , but the uk is a meme at this point ... just let it go, 
  i can only wonder how many people will `` get '' this . 
  that 's pretty cool, 
  that 's cute, 
  he never stated that ... 
  this is a leftie subreddit, 
  or a fris\u00f8r in bod\u00f8, 
  i just do n't understand why people who do n't partake in 4chan forums assume it is a board full of `` evil '' people - left/right extremists , bigots , psychopaths , genocide deniers , doxers and alike . 
  there are obviously precedence for these , but those exist ( ed ) on reddit as well ... coontown comes to my mind first . 
  thanks . 
  i did not even bother replying to him when the argument is a meme-tier index like world happiness index and also not understanding the difference between the two . 
  it 's like saying countries that feature the color red in their flags are generally happier/richer/better / worse because 8 out of 10 in the top 10 have it . 
  not sure why are people downvoting you though . 
  ca n't even say it is against their agenda , because i seriously doubt there is one that subscribes to constitutional monarchies . 
  two kilos of szegedi paprika to this based honorary hungarian !, 
   our constitutional monarchies work better than most other political systems , so you ca n't really call it an embarrassment . 
  since it 's entirely subjective , it can hardly be a fact . 
  not meant to be a dick with this comment of mine , but let 's face it , `` are x women hot '' searches always return the value `` yes '' . 
  looking back at the trends of the past decades , decent chunk of third worlders also help in the overall process . 
  i hold absolutely no stakes in this , but i somehow want the balkanization of the uk . 
  not sure why . 
  still butthurt about 2004 , even after what happened in 2016 ? 
  after couple of months of studying bokm\u00e5l , i 'd put up nynorsk to the `` pain in the ass '' list as well, 
  my flair checks out, 
  that was in the pre-white guilt era though . 
  street would be the closest interpretation, 
  kebab ai n't really popular here . 
  gyro , on the other hand ... 
  fuck you too, 
  b. . but ... wegier polak ... dwa bratanki ; _ ;, 
  you forgot the / s tag , i presume ? 
  i thought you folks enjoyed dealing with them ? 
  i was just dicking around . 
  of course there is no iran flair , it is nordrhein-westfalen for sure . 
  anyway , it is sort of disrespectful to use it for simply this , no doubt . 
  although i 'm not sure how much pride people take in their states in germany . 
  it would not be the first time if a flag was represented w/o symbols, 
  iran is a country, 
  5 minute walk to the university . 
  three times a week . 
  the suffering is real .
