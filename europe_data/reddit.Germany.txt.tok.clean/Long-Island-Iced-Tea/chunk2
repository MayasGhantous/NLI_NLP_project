  got a 5 minute tram ride with a 5 minute walk once a week . 
  not that i know of . 
  except he is my arch enemy . 
  but to be honest , i 'm just a long island / rhode island / new england fanboy and cocktail connosieur . 
  i did hesitate between liicetea , singapore sling and mai tai ( because i happen to be a singapore and polynesia fanboy as well ... ), 
  when will frau merkel stop playing whack-a-mole with eu members ? 
  oh sure , forgot about you folks, 
  right . 
  anyone can update my memory about the countries that noped or try to nope out of the immigrant issue ? 
  v4 , denmark , finland , and ... ? 
  they say do n't judge a book by its cover , but man , them entering belarus just ca n't go well, 
  oh come on , be creative :-) ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ either ^ ^ ^ choose ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ nordrhein-westfalen ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ iran ^ ^ ^ flair . 
  ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ upside ^ ^ ^ down ^ ^ ^ text , ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ google ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ use ^ ^ ^ charmap, 
  well i was always the annoying piece of shit of the classroom . 
  works much better if you are actually from nordrhein-westfalen , but claim iran in your flair . 
  or vice versa . 
  compare numbers with hungary and you will realize why this _ might _ work here, 
  except it did not . 
  what exactly do we have in common ? 
  orb\u00e1n confirmed as jesse pinkman, 
  what a time to be alive . 
  seriously . 
  i 'll guess my english is alright . 
  expert in cockney rhyming slang . 
  mastered geordie strictly for the funzies . 
  ... and basically that was my time to shine . 
  because , when it comes to actual neighbours , i do n't know jack shit in slovakian , slovenian and romanian . 
  shit-to-average knowledge in \u00d6sterreichisches deutsch . 
  enough in croatian / serbian to get into serious misunderstandings ... probably not enough to get out of them . 
  can read and write in greek , cyrillic , and most of hiragana , though the latter hardly has anything to do with europe and neither of these have anything to do with speaking . 
  tl ; dr jack of all trades , master of none ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ better ^ ^ ^ ^ than ^ ^ ^ ^ master ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ one, 
  from finland to new jersey . 
  i smell an interesting story there . 
  no it 's amazing, 
  the thing is , even i would be completely okay to live in slovenia . 
  i mean , honest to god , it 's nice . 
  but 10 bucks it wo n't be good enough for them . 
  so , i 'm a little fuzzy on the mechanics here ; the european union should declare war on certain members of the european union ? 
  you can always erect penises , i guess, 
  palisade , wow , thanks ; pleasant surprise . 
  i have been looking for that word for like ... a year . 
  the whole world is anti-hungarian these weeks , maybe except for v4 ... but do n't worry , we are getting used to it . 
  now imagine 15 000 agents at roughly the border size / length of rhode island or connecticut . 
  100 miles ... you would literally be halfway through the country here . 
  i 'm not saying this whole procedure will be flawless , hell no . 
  but i do n't get the negative tone either . 
   we need some pressure on hungary for them to accept the quota system right now , that would be immediate political suicide for the government . 
  probably not going to happen ^ ^ ever . 
  in the upcoming years . 
  anti-refugee hate or refugee hate ? 
  especially when someone practices cockney rhyming slang, 
  same thing in russian , as far as i know ( \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a ) . 
  man , these slavs , 
  nobody said a single thing about yes or no questions or binary variables . 
  facts are facts , but who says you ca n't cherrypick from the * set * of facts ? 
  ^ ^ also , ^ ^ mind ^ ^ you , ^ ^ the ^ ^ - stan ^ ^ suffix ^ ^ is ^ ^ not ^ ^ necessarily ^ ^ about ^ ^ islam ^ ^ or ^ ^ muslims , ^ ^ when ^ ^ given ^ ^ as ^ ^ a ^ ^ name ^ ^ to ^ ^ european ^ ^ places . 
  it has nothing to do with cherrypicked statistics . 
  does he really have to state the obvious ? 
  come on . 
  you must be new here . 
  not at all, 
  prison _ and/or _ deportation . 
  perfectly enforceable , but i 'm pretty sure we will fuck it up anyway . 
  confirm , it is, 
   i said he is surrounding himself with people with similar political opinions and driving away everybody else in his surroundings with his politically extreme statements . 
  really ... 
  much cherrypicking too, 
  no , just me failing at proper formatting . 
  it 's very hard to argue with ideas and emotions . 
  fixed, 
  yeah i do n't know , i never really planned moving there , just theory-crafting . . 
  it 's the only city with an actual skyline in europe imho . 
  people will definitely argue and say london has one too , and paris has la d\u00e9fense , i do n't like those . 
  they are barely reminiscent of seattle , nyc , and so on . 
  also , it looks like the most international city in germany for obvious reasons , of course i do n't know , i have never been there . 
  for a guy whose german is spotty , that 's a plus for me . 
  london has a lot of third world people and districts , i am going to assume frankfurt has less . 
  even it this sentence is false , london is literally circlejerked to death , both here and in real life . 
  i might be able to land a job in frankfurt , i 'm in accounting and finances . 
  of course the same can be told about london , no doubt . 
  the size of frankfurt is ideal for me . 
  not small , not ridiculously large , even though i know i mentioned tokyo before , so overall this makes a really weird point . 
  top10 , possibly top5 or top3 airport in europe . 
  and a lot of other reasons , i 'm not in the mood to write a wall of text right now , but i think you get the idea . 
  norway , because of fjords , and you are one ~ ~ border ~ ~ country away from north korea . 
  germany , because of frankfurt . 
  northern ireland , luxembourg , liechtenstein , because they are niche . 
  austria , because any time i was there it was like home v 2.0 . 
  iceland is a big one , too . 
  superb nature and far , far away ... do n't have any bullet point on my `` places to avoid '' list . 
  but for me , nothing really competes with vancouver , tokyo or singapore . 
  smells like an interesting story . 
  to all who say that this is not a good test - which i sort of agree with - can you link a decent / better one ? 
  i 'm ( -0.5 ; 0.1 ) by the way , and i honestly expected a way different one due to my weird/extreme thoughts . 
  i think you meant prime minister . 
  i mean , you must have , because there is not much to say about \u00c1der , let it be good or bad . 
  whoa , they might have to apply cold water to the burned area . 
  well , how come ~ ~ belorussia belorus ~ ~ belarus is not in eu ? 
  right ? 
  i have a hard time believing that i actually care about a chelsea match .
