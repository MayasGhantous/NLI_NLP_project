  in fact , i 'm probably more invested in leicester 's title than in the team 's title i am rooting for and a fan of . 
  as with many reddit discussions , this one also comes down to the problem of representation . 
  we can happily talk about it on reddit , i 'll even bring biscuits , but apart from a few guys like me or others in this submission , people just ignore this systematical problem . 
  what am i even talking about , it 's not systematical at this point , it 's fundamental . 
  when you quite openly steal almost a billion dollars ( that actually happened ) , and you do n't get a lot of public backlash or to be more morbid , even death threats , you know it 's already a lost fight . 
  the shittiest thing is , some people probably do n't even understand what is going on . 
  plenty have risen , yes , but they seem to be lacking support . 
  i 've had this completely left-field idea of not having a single hungarian in the parliament . 
  none at all . 
  you know , like `` outsourcing '' the whole legislative ordeal for the highest independent bidders , regardless of nationality or alignment . 
  maybe a huge board with different nationalities . 
  of course this is absurd , a pipe dream basically , but i do n't think they could do worse than this . 
  well i 'm not saying this is my opinion , in fact i try not to totally dig myself into internal politics because it would only end up as fuel to my rage and hatred . 
  absolutely disgusting . 
  beyond that . 
  but - and i honestly hate myself for typing this - every nation gets the government it deserves ... 
  as much as i like to shitpost under your comments , you are right . 
  the problem is , it honestly seems like that we _ only _ have incompetent , corrupt and useless ones . 
  corrupt does not even describe it , to be honest . 
  at this point , it 's not even about finding yourself in the political spectrum , leaning left or right - it 's more like `` all of them are straight up shit , no questions asked , but probably party x - these days , fidesz - is the least shit '' . 
  i 'm right wing ( actually , i do n't consider myself any-wing , but that is probably the closest ) , but i would not mind voting for a leftist politician , had i known he or she actually the decency and general competence to bring us from the `` two steps forward three steps back '' to `` baby steps forward '' . 
  i would be rather happy to see the foundation of a [ dna-like ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_anticorruption_directorate ) anti-corruption agency that actually obliterates even the smallest glimmer of corruption , theft , embezzlement and alike with severe punishment . 
  not gon na happen though ... 
  i will never understand why gun control is so important _ for reddit _ . 
  delivered in a leicester city fc box , which was made out of adrian mole books . 
  no hungary ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ see ^ ^ ^ myself ^ ^ ^ out . . 
  it 's really run of the mill here , however , you do have to give credit for creativity . 
  songoku has ham , shrooms and corn ( sonka , gomba , kukorica ) there 's also a pizzeria in szeged that sells kgst . 
  kgst , which literally stands for council for mutual economic assistance ( you know , comecon ) , is basically songoku with sour cream base ( kukorica , gomba , sonka , tejf\u00f6l - kgst ) . 
  then , during the heat of the migrant crisis , we had migrant pizzas , although they [ barely ] ( http://hir.ma/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10727945_bc85eef176cf76526d5e9da9ab984448_wm.jpg ) resemble anything like a pizza . 
  starting from the left , clockwise : immigrant pizza , terrorist pizza , syrian pizza , aand ... ahmed pizza . 
  hawaiian pizza is quite popular too . 
  no , you do n't have to educate me on how pineapple as a topping is ridiculous , i know that right , i would love to be an elitist douchebag and say that neapolitan is the only way to go , but what the fuck am i supposed to do when it just tastes so great . 
  peach is also an underrated topping , but that 's not exactly common here ( and i assume it 's not exactly common anywhere else ) . 
  all in all , we have lots of interesting toppings , some of them hilarious , some of them leftfield , some of them ridiculous . 
  __________________ also , deep frying pizzas is really not our thing . 
  maybe the internet-educated folks heard about chicago style pizza and alike , but ask a random dude about deep frying pizzas , and you will get confused looks .

  of course they would not . 
  what 's your point here ? 
  orb\u00e1n critically acclaimed . 
  magyar dudes , anyone else feel like this is a pipe dream ? 
  even beyond that ? 
  the shit-stain of a government we have seemingly became a relevant factor in europe , especially in this huge topic . 
  without taking sides , the past six months ... what a fucking time to be alive . 
  past week 's oscar seems like a cake walk compared to this . 
  no half measures please . 
  those were the days . 
  outstanding work there . 
  pros : - food ( according to foreigners ) - women ( according to foreigners ) - people are surprisingly friendly in some areas - most sunshine hours in central europe are in southern hungary ( not a big fan of this , but it 's definitely a crowd pleaser ) - performing way above our weight in sports - if you are from western europe , it 's ridiculously cheap - nothing really happens - eu - free healthcare ( long shot ) cons : - food ( according to me ) - nothing really happens - probably beyond repair - eu - budapestistan - education is a terrible joke here - `` brazilians '' - everything about politics ( and everything is about politics ) - we are really not the fan favourites in europe these days - esports is dead as ... * dead * - kings of obesity in europe are : uk and hungary - victor orbanescu , fidesz , entire left wing ( , jobbik ? 
  every single party ? ), 
  set up a branch here as well , and 2016 will be a much better year for them, 
   many in saxony are very well educated , well diverse *** yet *** the xenophobia is spewing like no tomorrow . 
  i do n't really see the contrast here . 
  dude i ai n't ; it 's actually about scoring cool guy points , there is really not much to this mess at all . 
   this whole thing is about 1200 people who they get to hand pick . 
  no , it is about sending a message . 
  that 's hilarious, 
  man , i just love my country . 
  better call saul of the real world . 
  we can agree that one has to be outstandingly stupid to do that . 
  norway is the one eyed king in the land of blind . 
  it would be so funny if this entire eu referendum clusterfuck would somehow lead to the dissolution of the uk . 
  i 'm honestly not trying to over-dramatize this , but the `` idgaf '' work attitude is quite common here . 
  not the majority , definitely not , but big and systematic ( al ) enough to notice it . 
  and it 's not like the kids or the parents could blame the teacher . 
  the state of pe equipment is often ridiculous and sometimes even nonexistent . 
  it sounds cool in theory , that 's for sure , but nobody really gives a shit about pe classes - as in , a lot of students do shady or morally questionable things to avoid pe , or just simply skip , and sometimes even the teacher barely gives a fuck . 
  not saying this happens in every single school , but it 's not uncommon either . 
  with very primitive estimation , i would say that * 40 % of my pe classes in hs consisted of swimming ( that is , the 2008 version of netflix and chill - sitting in the thermal spas playing chess ) , * 30 % was football ( which is nice and we are a football nation as , to an extent , every european nation is , but you can just stand on the sides or in the post doing nothing . . ) * 20 % was actual pe ( but even this feels like i 'm exaggerating ) * and the teacher did not show up / ignored us / told us to go home in the remainder . 
  not sure what i want from this . 
  leave now and beg years or decades later to rejoin without the special snowflake attributes ? 
  ( assuming the eu will still exist then . ), 
  no matter the result , i will be happy that this whole ordeal will be over in a couple of months . 
  it has been annoying for everyone . 
  i really want to say something cringey like i should order a bottle of some low tier mo\u00ebt for that day , but i 'm a cheap fuck , so ... 
  cringeternational law , you mean ? 
  cringeker is basically the luminousinverse of european politics, 
  i have the sex drive of a jolly rancher , but damn , croatia . . 
  s z e g e d b o y s, 
  just wanted to say the exact same thing . 
  upside down flags reunite !, 
   notandrei alt account for / u/andrei _ tv , or some personal banter with him ? 
  edit : oh , i see it now :(, 
  still , i 've always wondered why the anti-eu sentiment guys bash poles , romanians , hungarians etc. 
  for being there , whilst somalians , pakistanis , iraqis , indians and the rest of the third world is just shrugged off as `` but it 's the commonwealth '' or `` shit happens '' . 
  is there a background for that ? 
  uh huh, 
  still waiting for a ~ ~ positive ~ ~ neutral / u/dngrs comment on any hungary-related article . 
  by some people . 
  these days ? 
  i 'm not even sure if that is bad . . 
  how the mighty have fallen . 
  it 's not always easy to decipher satire-irony-fun-etc these on the interwebs these days . 
  have a good one . 
  the actual point being ?
