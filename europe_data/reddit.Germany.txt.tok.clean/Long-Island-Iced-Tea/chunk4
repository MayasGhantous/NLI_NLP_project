  i get it , double standards , tu quoque , pot calling the kettle black , the skunk calling the rose stinky , yadda yadda , but is there really a point , an argument , or any depth in this ? 
  if a present day german politician advocates and supports the anti-nazi sentiment , will that mean that he or she is a `` hypocrite '' ? 
  i mean , if you go back far enough , then ... 
  sad as fuck, 
  i am a vienna fangay and i have never heard about it . 
  beautifulpane, 
  i am not sure if this is disgustingly leftist , or the quoted post is disgustingly right-wing . 
  or both . 
  so georgia is europe . 
  lmao, 
  joseph csaky szeged art deco / cubism master race, 
   amnesty, 
  economist is still allowed on this sub ? 
  thank you for saying this . 
  so annoying . 
  this looks amazing . 
  look at my flair ffs . 
  who 's stopping them from meeting in secrets right now ? 
  this is completely irrelevant . 
  you basically dumpstered him . 
  ... after bashing him for months . 
  what kind of app do you use ? 
  reddit is fun has flairs ( well , at least flair texts . 
  would give you gold for this thought of yours , fellow slovakian . 
  so i have been trying to find a decent time and place to ask this , still sort of off-topic , but here we go . 
  is there a chinese or japanese influence on the eastern part of russia ? 
  let it be a big thing ( for example , more buddhists or shinto , more loanwords from these languages , anything ) or routine ( chinese or japanese or korean cuisine having an impact , way of life , tea , and so on ) . 
  i have been thinking about this for a long time , i 'm honestly interested . 
  right ? 
  i am not even mad, 
  orb\u00e4hn . 
  to an extent , it is sort of a failure ; and no , i 'm not homophobic , quite the contrary - i mean , for example , a lot of us love homosexual porn , e.g. 
  it 's not wrong , but it 's not really productive for obvious reasons . 
  and it 's not that i 'm some pro-expansive population policy guy , i 'm just saying . 
  except it sort of does . . 
  well it certainly is the vagina of this century, 
  almost all of my polish acquaintances and friends live in chicago . 
  not sure why chicago though , e.g. 
  why not la or seattle or houston or anywhere else . 
  it seems like all of them ended up in chicago somehow, 
  envyus ' french cs : go squad is definitely top 3 in the world . 
  taking their recent performances into account , saying that they are the best in the world _ right now _ is probably not a long shot . 
  they do it in a very convincing and entertaining way . 
  the french had a few teams in dota 2 , but they are long gone . 
  there are barely any frenchman in the pro scene at the moment . 
  as for sc2 , they have a couple of guys , but nothing crazy . 
  lilbow had a cringeworthy performance couple of days ago . 
  please no . 
  ni is on my `` chic / leftfield countries-places to move to '' list , right next to iceland , singapore , rhode island and slovenia . 
  the actual system is way too different for me to fully comprehend . 
  the funding aspect is , as someone said before , bizarre . 
  people are campaigning for a guy who is getting to his late 70s . 
  i 'm not an `` ageist '' but still , this kind of spoils it . 
  another group of people advocate some sort of comedian or tv personality i have only heard of in die hard 3 a rather long time ago . 
  bush : man , these bushes have rather controversial images . 
  not sure about jeb ... i mean , there 's just got ta be a behind-the-scenes reason for him trying it later than his brother - assuming they are brothers and i did not make a fool out of myself . 
  another not-so-relevant candidate has hungarian ties , right ? 
  the way my friends - a select few who care about us politics - think about the 2016 election is , well , basically selecting the lesser evil . 
   white guilt detected, 
  reddit hug of death , i presume ? 
  hungarian living in estonia ? 
  smells interesting . 
  holy molly . . 
  i have never thought i will say this regarding an anime-comic-whatever , but this sounds actually interesting . 
  well i ca n't speak for all of hungary , but from my experiences , cocktail culture is rather poor here . 
  mojito , cosmopolitan , sex on the beach , cuba libre , bloody mary are quite common , but stuff like liit , bellini , tom collins , singapore sling etc. 
  are nonexistent . 
  i make it myself . 
  to be honest , we have our own kinds of mixture drinks . 
  seltzer water and wine ( just look at this [ image ] ( http://www.infocegled.hu/external/uploaded_images/55a662037d650.jpg ) - quite a few variations ... ) , vodka and seltzer water and fruit syrup into soda siphon , and to be honest , any soft drink ( or even energy drink or whatever ) with any distilled beverage . 
  obviously these are not cocktails , but relatively popular . 
  in the end , we really are a beer-wine-p\u00e1linka nation , the latter one not being a really good distilled spirit for cocktails . 
  * join together * biblethump, 
  actually made me laugh, 
  flair checks out . 
  baltic countries with their oddball colour flags are pretty good . 
  really . 
  also do n't read much into this , but the _ flag _ of [ austria-hungary ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/flag_of_austria-hungary_%281869-1918%29.svg/2000px-flag_of_austria-hungary_%281869-1918%29.svg.png ) is also pretty cool . 
  does not do much in the colour department , but the overall design seems unique . 
   flag of silent hill - err , isle of man nice one, 
  wrong on so many levels i wo n't even try . 
  it 's hard to deny she was a major playa in that . 
  washington times delivering again, 
  tells a lot about the nobel peace prize ... 
  a certain part of europe being * east * russia ? 
  [ how ? 
  ] ( http://geology.com/world/world-map.gif ), 
  honestly ? 
  i do n't see how being dominated by the polish political elite is worse than being dominated by eurocrats / orbanescu / fidesz, 
  let 's just make one nation and call it visegr\u00e1dia , just for the funzies . 
  living in a small country can be pretty boring and frustrating sometimes . 
  hungary with a shoreline ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ four ^ ^ ^ ^ million ^ ^ ^ ^ angry ^ ^ ^ ^ croats ? 
  yes please . 
  eli5 the political and / or legal importance and underlying patterns of recognizing a genocide ( or anything for that matter ) , please ? 
  collectivism is frowned upon here , a complete taboo . 
  expect a lot of slurs if you have collectivist tendencies . 
  just kidding , i bet 8 out of 10 people have never heard about collectivism and/or individualism , let alone hofstede dimensions and alike . 
  the map does not make a lot of sense either . 
  central and southern hungary is 90 % individualist ? 
  what does that even mean ?
