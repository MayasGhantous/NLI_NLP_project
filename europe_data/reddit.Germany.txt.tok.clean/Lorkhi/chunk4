  b\u00f8rk !, 
  why are there so many policemen in a parking garage ? 
  is n't that ( from erdogans/his governments point of view ) not a waste of resources ? 
  ( of course i do n't support it ), 
  remove hipster from premises . 
  @ all if you try to find it you get alot of ` fake movies ' ( fake = not the original film ) like [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sdspz3_-18 ) , [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2rj0vesnga ) or [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8rjoccbs8c ) some people take this very serious . 
  at the moment it seems to be impossible to find the real film if you try it with english key words . 
  this protest seems to be more hilarious than i thought . 
  how many of the polish guys who are outraging now really watched the series ? 
  the reproach that we are pushing responsibility for the holocaust to the polish is just ridiculous . 
  the fact that the ` protest ' in poland began ** before ** the series was shown there creates the impression that some people started criticism and the circle jerking began . 
  you need alot of imagination for transfering the acting of a bunch of partisans ( who did n't kill any jew in the series , correct me if i 'm wrong because it was some months ago that the series was shown here ) to the whole polish people . 
  i quote myself :  the invitation to an exhibition about looted art sounds like mockery . 
  it seems that putin wanted to test how far he can go . 
  he got his answer and now they can go back to business . 
  i would n't take this too serious . 
  i still wait for the `` you can be swiss and have no idea what they are talking about '' . 
  the headline on ~ ~ it 's ~ ~ its own is enough to let my blood start seething . 
  ` angst ' , do n't make me laugh . 
  this arrogance is unbelievable . 
   you know , how do we disrupt terrorist activity , how do we mitigate security threats , both to us and to germany yeah , we had alot of terrorism here ... oh wait . 
  they can go to bavaria instead . 
  no one speaks german there . 
  after ~ 20 minutes ( or sooner ) it sounds like a mantra . 
  my biggest shock was in japan . 
  i was there for a week and two times people in the train touched my hair ( i 'm neither a woman nor is my hair special ) . 
  that was the weirdest thing that happened in my whole life . 
  but i do n't know if this was a cultural thing or just the wrong trains ... 
  some minor stuff : england : why are your sausages dry like a bag of flour ? 
  usa : plastic cups , plastic cups , ice cubes in beer ( only barbarians put ice in beer ! ), 
  and did i mention the plastic cups ? 
  not really . 
  it 's more cordial love-hate . 
  of course not . 
  not only the dutch ladies ... and their heels make it even worse -_-, 
  as a 1,72 m guy : oh my neck ... 
  can you name some ? 
  i would n't call an average imam a leader ( and even if they are , most of them are n't really a ` problem ' ) . 
  besides i do n't know prejudices against christains here which are comparable to the typical honour killing , locking their women or potential terrorist stuff . 
  there are islamic `` leaders '' ( in germany ) ? 
  middle earth , megaupload got busted there , awesome kiwi-dance and rugby . 
  mostly positive . 
  but the part with megaupload was n't cool ... no , not cool !, 
  monkey will take care of the greeks who work in the potatoe-mines . 
  b. ... b. . . but belgium is neutral . 
  in accurate counted rice grains and `` best wishes '' . 
  yeah , the f-104 is an open wound ... for everyone who does n't know : it had nicknames like erdnagel ( ground nail ) , witwenmacher ( widow maker ) , sargnagel ( coffin nail ) or bemannte rakete ( rocket with a man in it ) . 
  alone in germany ~ 300 of the 916 planes crashed because of technical problems ( edit : and of course design problems ) and 116 pilots died . 
  people who want easier access to guns are very rare here . 
  because it 's just not necessary to carry a gun in public . 
  would i live in the us my view on gun laws would be another because everyone ( including potential criminals ) already have guns . 
  there are too many registered and unregistered weapons in circulation . 
  that implies at least some ` healthy paranoia ' . 
  it 's a reference to a shampoo commercial : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y_b1zuefii, 
  herrentag = father 's day = pseudo reason for boozing ( even if you are not a father ) no herrenrasserubbish . 
  i think 3 . is n't really necessary . 
  but this year germany tries 1 . and 2 . 
  all what we do is taking a woman with big boobs and steal swedens song ... it will be embarrassing . 
  my first reaction : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5kh9z383he, 
  that 's not funny . 
  sounds like i have an inner viking . 
  always when i see a cronation : my memory is like a sieve ... why did we banned the kaiser ? 
  the slides are n't very usefull without visiting the lecture and exercise courses . 
  but heres some stuff http://www.share-online.biz/dl/ca8h3vlmj6f ( the lecture is better than the documents ... they always say the students should write their own xd ) wikipedia gives a good overview about data mining : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data_mining, 
  about style and clothes : young prolls : http://www.news-on-tour.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ntoi_die_atzen_disco_pogo_03.jpg an older proll and his wife : http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/nt52y1-nftq/0.jpg, 
  i found some german comments in your history , so here are some links  data mining : http://wiwi.uni-paderborn.de/dep3/decision-support-operations-research-lab-prof-suhl/lehre/lehrveranstaltungen/w2362-data-mining/ mining social media : http://pbfb5www.uni-paderborn.de/www/fb5/public/readfromwebonly/fakww-modulhandbuch.nsf/1f29cbe2da2fa1e4c125705100486ccb/e814320a2b2a4db7c1257aec004748ae?opendocument, 
  the nearest equivalent here would be ` prolet ' or ` proll ' ( from proletarian ) . 
  but i would n't really call it a culture . 
  freely translated : * it-based controlling * e-business * erp in corporate controlling * manufacturing logistics * computer based production and logistics * methods for decision support ( enough math for killing someone ) * economic base for net market * it investment evaluation * methods for project management * data mining * mining social media ( for the hipsters ) * sentiment analysis * ... 
  business informatics in paderborn , germany . 
  why here ? 
  my course is not really ` homogeneous ' in germany and i liked the mix of modules here . 
  most universities just mix existing modules from informatics and business sciences and call it business informatics . 
  ok , they do the same here but additional we have some more subject-specific modules . 
   germans do n't have humor . 
  zis is not ******* funny !, 
  or  lol , pls say ` squirrel ' ok , but you say ` eichh\u00f6rnchen ' before . 
  and they needed ~ 82 seconds to reearn the money . 
  hopefully this was a lesson for them !, 
  her wrath will be terrifying . 
  ( not ), 
  in addition : when the price is right we can hastily bury thatcher in gorleben . 
  do n't tell us what to do !, 
  they are liberating their breasts ( very desirable too ), 
  what do i have to do for getting generous breast attacks on the street too ? 
  do you really think someone would care about ? 
  if no one tells him ... maybe ... 
  hypothetical question : how much would erdogan pay for cyprus ? 
  ( shitstorm in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ), 
  the more diplomatical correct way : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td9hctwjyly, 
  should be olympic . 
  that 's possible , thanks for making this clear . 
  i 'm no architect , so i just read the german wikipedia article about brutalism where my university is listed as an example . 
  ask at wolfgang.schaeuble@bundestag.de your concept for using zhe money sounds good . 
  ( at least better than those from zhe greek government ), 
  haha , that 's awesome . 
  :-d was there any good reason to replace the old prison building ? 
  in my opinion a conversion/modification would have been a much better idea . 
  in reality the cement walls look more ` dirty ' than sober ( they should repaint them ) ... we have even a cheap cobblestone floor in the foyer .
