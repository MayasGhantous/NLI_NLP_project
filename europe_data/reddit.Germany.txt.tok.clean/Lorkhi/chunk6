  people want alot of stuff . 
  is tradition . 
  collecting and destroying the stuff must be very expensive ... not to mention the cost of the police work . 
  throwing out the romans . 
  because fuck aqueducts , sanitation , roads , medicine , education , wine , public baths ... 
  a duplicated chip ca n't perform a chip authentication ( cav2 ) . 
  which makes the duplicate useless for electronic authentication . 
  russia does n't need flowers and colors ... or happiness . 
  now they went from hijacking parts from countries to hijacking demonstrations ? 
  \\* yawns *, 
  i 'm sure soon \u2122 he will also sell his memoirs . 
  denmark is broke as fuck . 
  k\u00f6niggr\u00e4tzer marsch https://youtu.be/j5bcf79rlwm der alte dessauer https://youtu.be/hgr2o7jitp0 british grenadier march https://youtu.be/oivspy8xy9i yellow rose of texas https://youtu.be/larglfevyqm, 
  can i sell stones before ? 
  what is this ? 
  people who want to pillory themselves by reusing nazi phrases ? 
  why should they get abu bakr al baghdadi alive ? 
  no one needs or wants him . 
  expensive as hell . 
  building is no problem , but operating costs and vandalism are . 
  martin sonneborn would agree . 
  he just needs one for tsipras next proposal . 
  that 's how to peacefully break up demonstrations . 
  just fake a bee swarm . 
  first they blame someone . 
  asking for another bailout is the next step . 
  poland is n't greece . 
  or other stuff ... they just need to pay the belarus fee \u2122, 
   we really need a flair that openly shows those who support federalisation . 
  the european federalists have a flag that could be implemented ... but its ugly as hell . 
  we are the agressor for [ insert problem ] in russian propaganda anyway . 
  no wars , only strikes . 
  football with much less gravity ... sounds like fun . 
  +1 p when ball reaches a stable orbit . 
  do n't want to downplay what the russians do , but african child soldiers are a much worse thing . 
  just imagine beeing forced to kill friends or family members `` for hardening '' .

  sorry for the link to the bild-channel . 
  all the other videos are remixes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cndcmevqfi he is the minister for economic cooperation and development ... well he needs development . 
  please eu ... stop this toll bullshit before it starts . 
  they are decent now . 
  but in 2030 they are most likely outdated and the development will take a long time . 
  besides they say they want to introduce in 2030 ... well i do n't remember bigger recent projects that were finished in time . 
  glorious new stealth technology . 
  even those people who sell fake likes . 
  peaceful protesters with military gas masks, 
  take some hells angels or bandidos , add some fascism cook them for 18 minutes and you get these guys . 
  best eaten at 88 \u00b0 c. 
  no really ... they applaud to what they claim to hate . 
  there are the right solutions and there are the easy solutions . 
  those are not always the same . 
  so we can arrest them , confiscate their stuff and deport them back to russia ? 
  reminds me of : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfpotia8p28 ( beware video quality can be seen as a crime ), 
  what has her father teached her ? 
  there are infinite ways to open a bottle and she does n't know a single one, 
  sometimes i think we should ask the opposite question . 
  but those are always extreme examples . 
  most of the time we just do n't give any fucks . 
  are these news a big deal in france right now ? 
  or is it more like `` oh , water is wet ? 
  i 'm not surprised . '', 
  ca n't speak for the arms industry . 
  but in government institutions you can sometimes find the most unfitting people in decision making positions . 
  and it becomes even more funny in non western countries . 
  perhaps we should lend sonneborn to you if its mostly about protest . 
  i want to open a bottle with my eye too ... 
  would raise the standards . 
  could also mean that there are n't real other threats . 
  it carries some sexy austerity suppositories . 
  i 'm not even surprised ... he 's a genius . 
  russian is a very stretchable word, 
  diplomatic efforts ? 
  russia has shown over the last year that its diplomatic reliability is quasi non existing . 
  if more coffins with `` soldiers on holiday in a war zone '' are necessary to show that invading neighbouring countries is not a nice move we should n't undermine others efforts . 
  a very pathetic person . 
  this time pls just ignore the complains . 
  complain on reddit about bad tourist behaviour . 
  public toilets have much higher follow-up costs ( cleaning , vandalism ... ), 
  reminds me of : http://www.titanic-magazin.de/uploads/pics/card_377670833.jpg `` zone-gaby in luck - my first banana '', 
   i say we hunt everybody who commits crimes rather than letting some slide and some not . 
  it 's unbelievable that this even needs to be said . 
  it seems to be an issue ~ 70 % of the dutch do n't give any shit about . 
  ( i would go so far that it would turn out similar in many countries ) democracy also means delegating power from the people to others so we do n't have to vote about everything . 
  especially if the issue is n't popular/controversial enough to get representative enough to get the people to the urns . 
  but in the end the way how the dutch people find a political decision is up to the dutch people . 
  the issue is the implication by some people that a political decision ratified by the other 27 countries needs to be thrown away because 60 of 30 % of the dutch voted for it . 
  why teachers and doctors ? 
  both have a good and stable income in germany . 
   human garbage sorry , but you are a very disgusting person . 
  / this there is no other likely candidate . 
  and with sch\u00e4uble as chancellor ... happy hunger games europe . 
  they 're just loud and annoying . 
  alot of numbers in this thread make me very sad . 
  i know there are huge differences in cost of living but i doubt it 's that cheap . 
  what was the media supposed to do ? 
  * not reporting because the case is shady and the police still investigating -  censorship !, 
  * reporting about it -  stupid clickbaits who just want to generate traffic . 
  fuck them !,
