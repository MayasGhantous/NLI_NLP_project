do n't make me like fp\u00d6 ... 
  booo !, 
  if that happens , i will proclaim noordland . 
  mv , sh , hh , hb and ( northern ? ),

  i thought about liep\u0101ja , you ? 
  build a wall , maybe .

  i know . 
  but i 'm poor . 
  at the moment i could n't even have a holiday in the neighbouring town . 
  :p  and you 'll find many german tourists around here as well . 
  if i want to meet germans , i could stay at home . 
  when i go abroad , i want to meet people from that country or people from all over the world . 
  lovely country . 
  some day i 'll come over for a visit . 
  i need to be less poor first , though . 
   what about these more than 100 million people from east germany to estonia who were enslaved by the soviet empire in the 80s and are free now . 
  ehhh ... of course , the last word on important ( international ) issues came from the ` big brother ' in moscow . 
  but the gdr was a german state , not a big gulag managed by moscow . 
  if you leave the early years of the gdr aside , the people most responsible for the actions were all germans . 
  the option `` do n't care '' is missing . 
   probably every bayern fan over the age of 12 drinks it . 
  make it 15/16 or something . 
  12 is way too young . 
   is west germany the same ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  but i would n't say that it 's still a east/west thing . 
  it 's more a city/region thing . 
  also , [ jena is actually quite nice .

   germany is really far behind with anti-smoking laws . 
  or you could say germany is more free than most countries . 
  it 's okay if smoking in bars , restaurants , public buildings , etc. 
  is forbidden . 
  but i do n't see why you should censor billboards or dictate supermarkets where ( or even if ) they have to sell cigarettes . 
  as long as you do n't smoke next to your kids or around people who do n't like it ( especially indoors ) , i do n't see a problem . 
  it 's your own health you destroy , after all . 
  i hate this antiliberal thinking . 
  seven , seven , alulu , seven , seven , one , two , seven , seven , alulu , one , two , three ? 
  as much as i like erbsensuppe , it does n't belong on a pizza ... 
  damn ... i almost expected that ... 
  but is n't a belgian shepherd [ brighter ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/female_malinois_2005-01-29.jpg ) ? 
  the bundeswehr dog above has a reddish colour . 
  what are the main differences between both breeds ? 
  it 's almost as if dutch and german were related . 
  would n't mind . 
  [ hey there . 
  til . 
  in german there 's tschechien for all and b\u00f6hmen for bohemia . 
  pretty sure it 's `` tsch '' . 
  tschechische republik is just too much of a hassle . 
  hallervorden had the main role in the movie . 
  and calling schweiger legend ... uhmm ... ehh ... 
  that 's bullshit . 
  aside of that , you have n't been to the cinema recently , i assume ? 
  damn , mumins was scary sometimes . 
  i 'm in my mid 20s and also old ... it seems . 
   most old people do . 
  of course . 
  the dutchy duck with a cute accent . 
  german football fans know . 
   poroshenko was elected after the war started . 
  shhh , do n't hurt his feelings with facts . 
  merkel definitely turned her normally conservative party more to the left in recent years . 
  but she 's really a centrist , imho . 
  not left-wing . 
  they just store it in vatican . 
  haha . 
  never . 
  she really is n't the person for self-enrichment , imho . 
  she likes power , but is n't much into money . 
  maybe she would do a lot to stay in power , but not for money . 
  i ca n't even imagine what she would do with money . 
  probably buy a few new pantsuits . 
  this is just the start . 
  for example , there are germans in the data as well , but they are n't named yet . 
  mascolo only said that no german politicians are in it . 
  guttenberg resigned because of plagiarism in his doctoral dissertation , not because literally stealing or tax evasion . 
  and the causa wulff , well . 
  compared to this leak ( in general , not necessarily the icelandic pm ) , it was a small thing . 
  and both got massive shit for that . 
  it 's not like they got away with it . 
  do n't trigger the bielefelders . 
  eh , who am i kidding ... ? 
  it 's iceland . 
  let 's not forget that . 
  given the low population , it 's possible that quite a few icelanders know people who are in this . 
  iceland has the same population as the german city of bielefeld . 
  and less people than duisburg or wuppertal . 
  how many people outside of germany have heard about wuppertal ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  both should * not * be punished if it was consensual and all . 
  and if you 're too catholic for that , both should be punished and not just the girl . 
  in my opinion , the age of consent is for protecting young people , so that older people ca n't take advantage of them by manipulating , etc. 
  not for punishing people who are exactly the same age . 
  what does that mean ? 
  a 30 year old women can not be punished if she has sex with a 15 year old boy ? 
  or a 15 year old girl can not be punished if she has sex with a boy the same age ?
