  because if it 's the latter , it 's pretty reasonable , if it would be the same for everyone , not just females . 
  in germany , if two 13 year olds have sex with each other , they can not be punished as well . 
  but that 's because the age of criminal responsibility is 14 too . 
   you do n't get offended by it , but you still correct people when they mislabel you . 
  of course . 
  but my impression from the internet ( ! ), 
  is , that estonians often care a bit too much . 
  but maybe in estonia itself it is n't that much of a topic . 
  til 112 is a europe-wide thing , not just germany . 
  why do basically all spanish people in this thread say this ? 
  i 'm definitely not one of the `` anything sexual below the age of 18 is a scandal '' persons . 
  i 'm quite liberal , actually . 
  but 13 seems * very * young . 
  13 year olds are mostly little kids . 
  now , if two 13 year olds doing their thing , consensual and with protection , i wo n't judge . 
  even though , i think it 's quite young . 
  but if the age of consent is 13 , it means * much * older people can have sex with 13 year olds as well . 
  and in my opinion a 13 year old ca n't give consent to such acts with older people . 
  13 year olds are * mostly * very naive and easy to manipulate . 
   but women can not be convicted for heterosexual sex below the age of 18 . 
  huh ? 
  i agree with you , actually . 
  but i do n't really see why it 's * so * important for many estonians . 
  why does it even matter ? 
  because denmark is a evil imperialist country !, 
   it 's a viking thing . 
  schleswig-holstein is rightfully nordic then . 
  deal with it estonia !, 
  actually , according to [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vpanza5.jpg ) ~ half of s-h , saaremaa and r\u00fcgen belonged to the early settlement regions of vikings . 
  this is true . 
  but in cases with a `` public interest '' the police can start a investigation by themselves . 
  no need for a complain by a parent/caretaker then . 
   matter of fact with the consent of the parents an adult can have sex with a 12 and 13 year old in germany . 
  absolutely not . 
  13 would even be highly illegal for a 14 year old who 's only one week older . 
   well , maybe if you had to take two showers every time you went out because even your underwear ( not to mention your hair , body etc ) reeked of smoke , you would change your mind . 
  uhmm ... `` smoking belongs outdoors or in private rooms '' . 
  i 'm totally on your side . 
   try the same shit in germany and see what happens . 
  just ... no . 
  while i disagree with a lot of the anti-smoking legislation , smoking in restaurants is disgusting and disrespectful . 
  smoking belongs outdoors or in private rooms . 
  roughly the same as in canada . 
  vollmilch has ~ 3,5-3 ,8 % . 
  low-fat has ~ 1,5-1 ,8 % . 
  magermilch has ~ 0,1-0 ,5 % , but i have n't seen that in a supermarket yet . 
  i 've never looked out for it , though . 
  then there 's also h-milch ( homo milk ) . 
  i think it has ~ 3,5 % . 
  there are more special kinds of milk . 
  i just buy vollmilch , though . 
  like most people , i assume . 
  and sometimes low-fat , when i do n't have enough money around ( low-fat is a little cheaper ) . 
  the `` normal '' milk does . 
  but you can get milk with less fat everywhere as well .

  similar to cheese . 
  austria is seen as south of germany , not east . 
  i know it 's basically both , but it 's only seen as a southern neighbour . 
  understandable , since it 's only really eastern for southern bavarians . 
   it 's used for storing ` real butter ' just cream and salt . 
  if you refrigerate it , it will be as hard as a rock . 
  i second this . 
  in germany i 've mostly seen something like this as well : http://i.imgur.com/eb1oqwe.jpg http://i.imgur.com/h11dyyo.jpg, 
  are we western ? 
  if so , belarus is definitely europe . 
  same with the western part of russia ( moscow , st.petersburg , etc ) . 
  but in germany everything east of germany is seen as eastern europe . 
  but eastern europe is still europe . 
  denmark , sweden , norway , finland are northern europe . 
  france , benelux , germany , uk , ireland , switzerland , ( austria ) are western europe . 
  spain , portugal , italy , greece are southern europe . 
  balkan is weird . 
  sometimes it 's south eastern europe , sometimes just balkans , very rarely it 's even eastern europe . 
  but that 's just my impression from living 25 + years in germany . 
  so very subjective . 
  is there a list for the dots in germany ? 
  gtd shows 51 incidents from 2002-2014 . 
  also , the picture in the article and the `` after 9/11 '' makes it sound like people were injured/killed or these attacks were done by islamists . 
  pretty sure she speaks flemish/dutch . 
   weird never heard anyone make use of that even those originally from oldenburg and sourrounding areas it 's * exclusively * spoken in saterland . 
  unless you have been [ here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/saterland ) , you 've most likely never heard it . 
  and even in that small spot , it 's only a small minority who 's still able to speak it , unfortunately . 
  but some do . 
   thanks for your research in any case !, 
   was n't really researching . 
  i 'm interested in languages and come from your region as well . 
  there could be secondary charges on the escape route . 
  maybe use a unconventional escape route . 
   decent integration policies we have no `` banlieues '' , so the situation in france and maybe also belgium is worse . 
  but i have my doubt about `` decent integration policies '' . 
  luck and maybe a bit better police/intelligence work . 
  but i 'm unsure with the second point ( ! ) . 
  it may also help that our biggest population of ( foreign - ) muslim background is turkish . 
  of course they can be extremists as well and there are also quite some people with 100 % historical german background who are islamists , but the recent attacks were all done by people with backgrounds from northern africa ( as far as i know ) . 
  also , the image of germany in the middle east is relatively good since a long time . 
  of course , islamists hate us and we are on pretty much all target lists . 
  but there are european countries with a worse image in historical muslim regions of the world . 
  but take my statements with a grain of salt , it 's pure speculation .
