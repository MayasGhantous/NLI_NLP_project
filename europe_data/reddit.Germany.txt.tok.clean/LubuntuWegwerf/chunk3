  really ? 
  brussels is one of the islamist target hot spots in europe . 
  and has seen attacks before ( jewish museum ) . 
  eh , this is homegrown terrorism . 
  the recent events only boosted it . 
   your cities i actually find unique talking about northern germany and dutch cities , have you ever been to friedrichstadt ? 
  lovely small city . 
  albanian and basque , though . 
  it 's saterfriesisch ( seeltersk/saterland frisian ) . 
  the region is a bit off and too big . 
  [ here 's the location . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/saterland/@53.0763603,7.6799161,10z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47b700630c247a83:0x426cf776300b750 ) [ here 's a proof that `` jee '' is right . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/#q=%22seeltersk%22+%22jee%22 ) [ here 's the wikipedia article . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saterland_frisian_language ), 
  kosovo has n't any numbers on the map . 
   civilians being shot in the streets , nsfw what the flying fuck ? 
  i ca n't think of a single point why this could be justified . 
  why is n't there a massive uproar in the european media ? 
  they were clearly unarmed . 
   if only there was another international airport nearby they could land at , maybe even across the border ... well , shit . 
  [ according to german news sources ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/viele-tote-bei-flugzeug-absturz-in-russland-boeing-aus-dubai-a-1083194.html ) , other flights had the same problem , but they landed in krasnodar instead ( one aeroflot and a flight from prague ) or flew back to their starting point ( flight from istanbul ) . 
  * edit : * but yeah , donezk would have been closer ... 
  you mean osterfeuer ? 
  then i misunderstood you . 
  i thought you meant specific rights given to minorities . 
  there should be the same rights for everyone . 
  [ see this comment . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4as5az/homosexuality_still_seen_as_a_disease_in_parts_of/d13h6j4 ), 
   but about specyfic rights for this or the other social , workers or `` sexual '' group . 
  examples ? 
   as long as ~ ~ gay ~ ~ straight people do their ~ ~ gay ~ ~ straight things in the privacy of their home why should that bother you ? 
  do you agree ? 
   i do however get the hate when they start parading around like it 's something to be proud of ... it 's like being proud of having different color hair or something . 
  because the local csd is the highlight of the year for every gay person ... by the way , i am bi/gay and never have been to a `` parade '' or whatsoever . 
  i do n't like them either . 
  but hell , why * hate * ? 
  why do you even care ? 
  what 's different to all the other parades for different topics ? 
  the only thing i completely understand is when people dislike the exhibition of sexual fetishes in broad daylight infront of kids . 
  your leather fetish costume with a bare ass does n't belong on a gay pride parade ( unless it 's a non-public one ) . 
  there could ( and will ) be children in the audience as well , man . 
  but this is n't a `` gay thing '' really , if a dominatrix with her tits out walks around , it 's the same . 
   gays are part of population , their needs should be cared for but i do n't see why goverment should give them benefits when from logical point of view they are n't any different than single people . 
  why does gay couple marrying should have bonuses which do n't have single people . 
  they should n't . 
  neither should heterosexual married couples without kids . 
  these kind of benefits ( tax reliefs , etc. ), 
  should be exclusively given to people with children . 
  no matter if single or married . 
  are the camps polish ? 
  three languages , actually . 
  envy ? 
  as much as i like denmark ( i live pretty close to the border ) , it 's not the land of milk and honey . 
  next level would be that every car has to be located by police at every time of the day . 
  next level every human . 
  and storing the biological information and medical history of everyone in the country is next level shit . 
  the transparent citizen is reality in denmark . 
  [ denmark is the only country in the world with registries that include everyone living in the country , making it possible to access , among other things , their medical history from cradle to grave . 
  ] ( http://studyindenmark.dk/news/denmark-launches-world-class-biobank ) i see the positive aspects of this , but the negative aspects are way too huge in my opinion . 
  this is 1984 . 
  but not only that , there 's a big possibilty for eugenic policies in the future . 
  brave new world ... do n't get me wrong . 
  danes are cool and chill people , danish guys are hot , i like the landscape , the cities , everything really . 
  even the language . 
  i 'm happy to have them as our neighbour . 
  but politically denmark is on many wrong paths . 
  the ankara bombing in february was aimed at the military . 
  the attack on the `` labour , peace and democracy '' rally was presumably done by islamists , but definitely not by pkk . 
  the january attack on tourists in istanbul was done by islamists as well . 
  because all big ( recent ) terrorist attacks aimed at civilians in turkey were done by islamists . 
  the last ankara bombing in february was aimed at the military . 
  the attack on ( german ) tourists in january ( istanbul ) was by islamists , so was the horrible attack aimed at the `` labour , peace and democracy '' rally in ankara last october . 
  fuck this shit . 
  seems like this was directly aimed at civilians . 
  so most likely islamists ? 
  not my type of music really , but i would definitely fuck him . 
  pretty much unrelated , but i always found this video quite cool : https://youtu.be/zhlvdxwp6mw?t=330, 
  how about a big reunion ? 
  we would accept willem as our king , he is german anyway . 
  this also seems to be the opinion of the finnish media , if a comment i 've just read on the website of a famous german newspaper is true . 
  in german media the shadiness of this incident is a topic every now and then ( every few years ) . 
  the comment said that finnish media does n't talk about the inconsistencies of this incident anymore . 
  and different versions do n't * seem * to be publicly acceptable . 
  it also said that this is nearly the only topic where the discrepancy in media coverage between finland and germany is that huge . 
  is this true ? 
  the biggest fuck up is , that until today , it is n't clear what happened . 
  the whole tragedy is very shady . 
  the smuggling ( / transport ) of military goods , the actions of especially the swedish government to undermine investigations , holding back evidence by officials , the sudden disappearance of survivors ... 
  there seems to be no real interest by sweden , estonia and finland in solving the case . 
  i think we have to wait a few decades until some people are dead and a new generation is in power . 
  born after the incident . 
  can we get the east cantons then ? 
  pretty please ? 
  can i come over , pls ? 
  dayum , you are right . 
  i 've actually been to sl-st . j\u00fcrgen quite a lot . 
  still did n't come to mind . 
  huh ? 
  what are those places in the north of germany ? 
  especially the one around schleswig ?
