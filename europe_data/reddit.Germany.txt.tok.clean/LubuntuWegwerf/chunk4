  also , the one on the nipple in the western part of schleswig-holstein is obviously sankt peter-ording , but the one next to it on the right must be friedrichsstadt . 
  since when was [ friedrich iii . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_iii,_duke_of_holstein-gottorp ) a saint ? 
  something is leaking here . 
   evil is sexy afterall yeah ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssdj6h-qeeu, 
  here 's the source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7192292/1-26022016-ap-en.pdf/602b34e8-abba-439e-b555-4c3cb1dbbe6e, 
  for people who are confused why darmstadt is on that map : they meant the * regierungsbezirk darmstadt * , not the city . 
  frankfurt ( main ) belongs to the * regierungsbezirk darmstadt * , for example , and more important , the hochtaunuskreis . 
  one of the richest districts ( maybe even the richest ? ), 
  in germany . 
  as a greek you should know that this situation is n't new at all and existed before mid-2015 . 
   yes countries like yours rolled out the red carpet and invited the whole world into europe source ? 
   and scapegoat nations like greece source ? 
  only if he/she is working for free . 
  * they * will make it sink . 
  aside of that , where do you push them ? 
  200m away and 5mins later the same again ? 
  and again , and again , and again ? 
  what do you think ? 
  that they 'll turn around at some point ? 
  so , you want to sink them ( if the migrants did n't sink it by themselves already ) . 
  and then ? 
  let them drown or pick them up ? 
  and if you pick them up , what are you going to do next ? 
  how ? 
  how exactly do you want to do that ? 
   i think this situation can only be fixed by the joining all eu members against merkels german government . 
  just curious , how do you think the migrant situation can be solved ? 
   and it showed that greece has absolutely no interest in reducing the influx the influx into the eu or the influx into more northern eu countries ? 
  in case of the first , how exactly should greece do that ? 
  sink the boats ? 
  in case of the second , understandable , is n't it ? 
   because you invited them seriously ? 
   disgusting lack of solidarity , and if this is the future of eu then it can go f *** itself . 
  amen . 
   in theory , the eu could assist by facilitating passage of migrants out of greece and onto other eu countries to relieve pressure on greece . 
  sure . 
  i bet that will work with the wonderful european solidarity we 've seen the last couple months . 
  as much as i dislike the current state of the eu institutions , the eu ca n't do shit if the majority of countries are opposing it . 
  pretty much as expected . 
  but i 'm quite shocked by greece , israel , korea and japan . 
  * edit * : and i expected tunisia and turkey to be a little better , to be honest . 
  do n't know why . 
   no mountains denmark is actually quite hilly . 
  at least compared to the netherlands and the german north/north-west . 
  make a test , here are the 3 frisian languages : https://youtu.be/auo1hfd9hdy?t=55 https://youtu.be/mrxocixqyk8?t=42 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ztllwhy-q8 i would appreciate it if a dutchy/frisian could provide a better link for west frisian . 
  ostfriesisch is a low saxon dialect , though . 
  not a frisian dialect . 
  unless you mean saterfriesisch ( saterland frisian ) , which is indeed frisian . 
  but i 've never heard anyone referring to saterfriesisch as `` east frisian '' yet . 
  found your dot : ** . 
  ** can i keep it ? 
  keep who away from sports ? 
  we have our fair share of hooligans and radical ultras . 
  i just would n't say that all of them are `` affiliated with one or another political party '' . 
  some are , of course , but far , far from * all * . 
  yes . 
  maybe it 's like that on the balkans , but not in germany . 
  there are left wing and right wing clubs , but that 's definitely not the case for * all * clubs/supporters . 
   at least for soccer in europe , where all supporters are openly affiliated with one or another political party . 
  uhm , no ? 
  well , you could say 9/11 was planned in germany . 
  does that count ? 
  everything makes sense now . 
  godverdomme . 
  certain european countries are responsible for getting to this event and for its outcome . 
  this * is * european news . 
  if you like it or not . 
  i wish more people would understand this . 
  did n't change . 
  [ rural schleswig-holstein ] i often see refugees on the street , in the supermarket , in busses and in trains . 
  so , they 're definitely there . 
  but that 's it . 
  never experienced any of the negative stories from the news . 
  as far as i can remember , the only kind of negative stuff was once in a train , but those people were heading to scandinavia and were n't staying in germany . 
  and a little kid ( around 6 maybe ? ), 
  at the train station in flensburg . 
  but little kids are little kids . 
  once a 17 year old asylum seeker from baghdad invited me to eat with him and his friends , after we talked a bit in a train . 
  i said no , in retrospect i should have said yes . 
  makes me a little sad . 
  oh , and i worked in a refugee accommodation for 2 ( or 3 ? ), 
  days . 
  normal work , not voluntary . 
  no special experiences there . 
  but it only was for a few hours , not the whole days . 
  ** edit : ** i forgot , i met a afghan woman with two little boys at the train station in neum\u00fcnster . 
  helped her to get to heide . 
  she asked me to take care of her kids for some time and got winegums for them ( i wonder if she knew that there 's gelatine in them ? ), 
  and for me . 
  one of the boys threw the plastic packaging into the waste bin . 
  unfortunately , the wrong bin . 
  i then had to teach him how a true german does recycling . 
   it will rip away their organizational structure nope . 
  learn to read . 
  seriously ... or did you forget a / s ? 
  come with vodka instead of a tank and you 're welcome . 
   you think it 's possible that a 13 year old chose to have group sex with three strangers who do n't speak her language for 30 hours ? 
  according to the police , it is n't sure yet what happened in the 30 hours . 
  they said the sex happened * before * she went missing .
