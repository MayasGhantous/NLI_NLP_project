  if there was also child sexual abuse while she was missing is n't sure yet . 
  do n't speak her language ? 
  therefore , it 's likely that both were born in germany , or at least have lived here most of their lives . 
  can we start with the niederl\u00e4nder ? 
  they can at least talk somewhat understandable . 
  rape is a different thing in the german law . 
  therefore , if the police says it was n't rape , the police means it was n't rape * by law * . 
  found a english version of the laws . 
  child sexual abuse law in english : https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1533 rape law in english : https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1557, 
  you can click on the missions/source-links for more informations . 
   so that means any sex with her is non-consensual . 
  which means rape . 
  read my other responses in this topic . 
  it really is just a translation/different-law-terms thing . 
   children at that age are considered too susceptible for coercion , blackamial , verbal abuse and so on . 
  of course . 
  that 's why it 's illegal . 
   rape does not need to be physically forced . 
  druging or blackmailing someone into having sex is also rape . 
  of course . 
  children ca n't grant consent . 
  but the words are different . 
  rape is translated to * vergewaltigung * in german . 
  by law , * vergewaltigung * is this : [ in german ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__177.html ) / [ in english ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1557 ) if someone is under the age of consent ( * schutzalter * ) , it 's a crime called * sexueller missbrauch von kindern * ( child sexual abuse ) : [ in german ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__176.html ) / [ in english ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1533 ) so in general , if the police would say it was n't a * vergewaltigung * ( rape ) and the sex was * einvernehmlich * ( consensual ) , it does n't necessarily mean it was legal . 
  it just means it was n't * vergewaltigung * ( rape ) by law . 
  i think a lot of the misunderstanding in this case comes from the different words/terms in different languages . 
  ehh ... it 's hard to explain if you do n't speak german . 
  rape : http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__177.html / [ english ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1533 ) child sexual abuse : http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__176.html / [ english ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1557 ) by law , it 's * child sexual abuse * . 
  * rape * has a different meaning by law . 
  * rape * ( vergewaltigung ) has nothing to do with the age of the victim in german language . 
  when it comes to age , it 's either * sexueller missbrauch von kindern * ( child sexual abuse ) ( under 14 ) or * sexueller missbrauch von jugendlichen * ( youths/juveniles sexual abuse ) ( 14 - under 18 ) . 
  shhh . 
  do n't tell 'em . 
  everything works as intended . 
  they 'll expect nothing . 
  ^ nothing ^ ^ ^ nothing ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nothing ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nothing, 
  we are surely not the most active ones , but do n't exaggerate , please . 
  i 'm not very up to date with recent events . 
  and especially in some places it has become quite a circle jerk . 
  i try to avoid that . 
  i just have really looked it up today . 
  but i can remember seeing news about it last week too , as far as i remember . 
  anyway , thanks for the link . 
  yes . 
  it 's mostly a language thing . 
  in germany * age of consent * is n't the direct translation * alter der einwilligung ( sf\u00e4higkeit ) * but * schutzalter * . 
  which means * protection age * . 
  so in german the word * consent/einwilligung * is n't existing in the name of * age of consent * . 
  but still , by law someone under 14 ca n't give consent . 
  saying `` it was consensual '' just means it was n't physically forced ( in general , do n't exactly know about this case ) . 
  but still very illegal . 
   30 hours is a pretty long time to be gone , she had to either be at another family 's home , a hotel , or the house of the guy she was having sex with if he is an adult no ? 
  [ tagesspiegel ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/lawrow-ueber-angeblich-entfuehrtes-maedchen-russlands-aussenminister-wirft-berliner-polizei-vertuschung-vor/12880582.html ) says it 's not sure yet what happened in that time . 
   did the police release that the men she accused were minors as well or what ? 
  according to [ tagesspiegel ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/lawrow-ueber-angeblich-entfuehrtes-maedchen-russlands-aussenminister-wirft-berliner-polizei-vertuschung-vor/12880582.html ) the men accused are in their early 20s . 
   is there romeo laws in germany so that if the men were 17 it 's not a crime ? 
  age of consent is 14 . 
  unless the suspects are below 14 ( age of criminal responsibility ) themselves , it 's illegal . 
  i think the problem here is that people do n't know the difference between * rape * and * child sexual abuse * . 
  it could be both , but from the stories i heard ( can you provide other sources ? 
  ) , it looks like it was n't rape but `` only '' * child sexual abuse * . 
  rape = non-consensual but since she 's 13 ( and the suspects are in their early 20s ) , it 's a crime nonetheless . 
   and all our berlin police has to say about it is `` no problem , we think it was consensual sex '' source ? 
  [ wiki .

   korwin i spent a good 10 minutes , maybe more , reading about this korwin-mikke guy . 
  he is a satirist , is n't he ? 
  i refuse to believe that he 's serious . 
  and 16,8 % of young poles voted for his party ? 
  that 's scary . 
  uff , do we have to protect our eastern border now ? 
  please go through the alps . 
  was n't it the youth who voted for pis ? 
  at least i 've heard that pis got more % from under ~ 30 voters than from ~ 60 + voters . 
  i 'm * not * sure if this is true , though . 
  would be nice , if a pole could provide some numbers . 
   he was asking previous government in official note about chemtrails what the hell ? 
   here 's mine ( from 4:00 to 5:00 ) , not much to look at . 
  lives in a paradies . 
  `` not much to look at '' ... 
   but then sd and greens would cut their funding they ca n't . 
  the guy who fked up his company ? 
  [ i do n't think so . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/8/83/julia_kl%c3%b6ckner_2015.jpg ), 
  it looks like a campaign strategy . 
  the decision of the swr caused a massive reaction in the german media , so kl\u00f6ckner / cdu want to look like the good guys here . 
  well , it works . 
  but to be honest , spd/greens deserve this for their stupid/anti-democratic actions on this matter . 
  ** story in short : ** * social democrats * and * greens * said , they wo n't join the tv debates before the state elections in rheinland-pfalz and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg if the * afd * takes part in it . 
  the * swr * ( public broadcaster in rlp and bw ) followed their wish ( * spd/greens * is the government in both states , by the way ) and said they wo n't invite parties which are not in the parliament at the moment . 
  this hits the * afd * ( right-conservative/right-populist ) , the * fdp * ( liberals/only in rlp , they are part of the parliament in bw ) and * the left * ( socialists ) . 
  now julia kl\u00f6ckner ( prime minister candidate of the * cdu * for rheinland-pfalz ) said she wo n't join the debate and criticises the * social democrats * for interfering with the * swr * . 
  if so , i pay 30 $ for 16mbit/s ( first 12 months , then 35 $ after ) . 
  i could get 50mbit/s for 5 $ / month more . 
  telekom here . 
  vodafone would be cheaper ( but with slower upload speed ) . 
  mid-size village in the rural north of germany . 
  read the articles . 
  you 'll know what i mean then . 
  you did n't even read the articles , did you ?
