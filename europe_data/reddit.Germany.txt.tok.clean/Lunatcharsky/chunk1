about time . 
  how else would i convey my merriment at this result ? 
  it 's quick and straight to the point , short and directly says what it 's supposed to . 
  communicational efficiency !, 
  we win xd, 
  october 3rd in my city xd, 
  look at the logo , actually that 's a vote for el\u00e4kel\u00e4iset . 
  certainly not . 
  what you publicise about yourself is your own fault . 
  hey , i did not say that i was in favour of that `` right to be forgotten '' . 
  rights and freedoms are for everyone , that includes douchebags . 
  do to your burgers what you want , we wo n't eat those , 
  sounds like that chinese five-spice-stuff o0, 
  gauck is an idiot , like the most of his predecessors in office . 
  forget him , almost nobody really gives a shit about what he says here . 
  ( even though he thinks otherwise ) when the chancellor speaks it 's relevant - the bundespr\u00e4sident : not so much . 
  get some d\u00f6ner into you ... what 's a putine anyway ? 
  well fuck you very much , ` murica . 
  moral-land ... wtf ? 
  there 's a small but important difference : no company has the right to make money of a picture of my property . 
  thus : fuck google streetview . 
  hey - i live in a rental complex and do n't really give a shit , but to blur a house or location should always be an option . 
  also for the photography : yes precisely , it should n't be . 
  there 's plenty of public buildings to take pictures of . 
  paranoid , is it ? 
  what business of a company of any kind is it to take pictures of my fucking house ? 
  no idea , try asking google . 
  every morning for the last 5 months i almost froze my balls of when i went to work , so excuse me but fuck you . 
  i 'm doing my best . 
  * burp *, 
  i have no idea , i only own my desktop-pc , so no syncing was ever used by me . 
  sounds like [ opera link ] ( https://link.opera.com/loginfront/ ), 
  no pc-bullshit is a positive for me , as is bluntness , but i know why they do it ... nevertheless : chrome * does * indeed suck . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/19supq/top_browser_by_country_in_europe_from_december/c8razzp ), 
   ok , you might no care about them but most of us do . 
  i might ... 
  i admit the idea of getting a new mp3-player and phone in one sounds good ( though i hate touch screens and all that app-garbage ) . 
   credit card activity hah , debit cards ant cash ftw . 
  also cooperative bank that does n't track . 
  and the spending-pattern thing is illegal too as far as i know . 
  man , he more i learn about the usa the less my desire to even visit . 
   send out advertisements man , this makes me almost feel patriotic ... here i can simply apply a sticker like [ this ] ( http://shop.classic-emaille.de/images/keine-werbung-flach-110x35mm.jpg ) to my mailbox , and the postal services are required by law not to put in any add letters . 
  also : [ robinson lists are great ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robinson_list ) . 
  *** precisely !, 
  *** i use opera-12 right now , do n't really know why anymore ... 
  i 'm running opera since version 8 and i guess it 's simple laziness that prevents me from switching to ff . 
  are there any bigger advantages that i should know about ? 
   data mining has become a part of life now . 
  having to commute at 4 am to get to work is a part of my life too , does n't mean i enjoy it though ... and if i can get late shift i bloody well will . 
  as for chrome : iron ( or any other chromium-based non-google setting ) works exactly the same ( obviously , lol ) and does * not * track , so why the fuck would i use the google-branded crap ? 
   isolate yourself from the modern world . 
  what precisely do you mean by that ? 
  i have the suspicion you are talking about garbage like facebook and other stuff i really , really do n't give a fuck about like smartphones and whatnot ... could you elaborate ? 
  yes , it does !, 
  i wonder whether the people who downvoted you ever read their therms and conditions before installing . 
  what 's it with opera and belarus ? 
  is lukachenko a fan or something ? 
  and * denmark * , what the hell are you doing ? 
  wtf 's going on in lithuania there ? 
  even james bond knows coffee is superior . 
  [ proof ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0xeo66xxas ), 
  me neither . 
  just because you ca n't make coffee . 
  * snort *, 
  news : a sack of rice has fallen over ... 
  seriously : whop cares which music was the shittiest ? 
  i dunno why they are so hung up on the word `` marriage '' . 
  equality before the law should be plenty enough as far as i 'm concerned . 
  but then again that kind of music sounds like shit anyways . 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
  nothing ... all partnerships are equal before the law already . 
  see that grey dot in the middle of germany ? 
  that 's hamburg , where i live . 
   '' ... you are better off without this electing people business '' [ yeah . 
  fuck cards . 
  what times ? 
  anyways , beer . 
  lulz i work in a kitchen , i do not miss it even in summer . 
  sweden, 
  germany - male - no . 
  the first sounds like utter lunacy , like american politics in general ... the latter though is something you need to work on . 
  because tonne is german for barrel . 
  hm , back then i was sleeping too . 
  because it 's 15:56 here . 
  my fav is long ton and short ton ... opposed to our own `` 1.000 kg = 1 ton '' thing . 
  as far as that shitty music is concerned , i hate categorically . 
  none , since it 's shit . 
  hamburg , germany . 
  30 minutes by bus and s-bahn . 
  that 's heilarious !, 
   and one again you are discussing your opinion , instead of what 's factually true about the existing laws . 
  well then , my sjw-friend , show me where the law does mandate anything but equality ( other than the word marriage ) . 
  it certainly does not matter to me in the slightest , and we have many , many way more pressing issues for our politicians to get around to than the word `` marriage '' . 
   in march 2014 , the government approved the proposed law to allow successive adoption , with discussion on whether or not to implement full adoption equality . 
  the bundesrat recommended full adoption equality , [ 15 ] and a bundestag committee held a hearing on the topic . 
  [ 16 ] on 22 may , the bundestag passed the law while rejecting proposals by the greens for full adoption equality . 
  [ 17 ] another law to grant full tax equality passed unanimously in the bundestag , finishing the required legal changes following the june 2013 court ruling . 
  among many others a point where all that is missing is the name `` marriage '' . 
  or in other words : the law actually says they have the same rights as any normal person .
