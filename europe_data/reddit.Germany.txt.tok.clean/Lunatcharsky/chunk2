  just to be clear , the * same * rights and duties before the law and in relation to the state - is not enough ? 
  as i said , never satisfied . 
  always want more . 
  it is equality to the extent any sane state can maximally manage without legislating private enterprise and religion . 
  god damn , never satisfied . 
  yeah , and my opinion is that german law is enough . 
  well , the same rights and duties they already got , the rest is n't my concern . 
  please leave me alone with it , 
  but ... fucking hell , it is marriage !, 
  do you define marriage exclusively as something that involves a church or something ? 
  equality before the law is fine , is n't it ? 
  huh ? 
  i do n't get it , registration before the law means marriage , does n't it ? 
  they can get a registered life partnership just like anybody else . 
  you 're fired . 
  i got the reference , meant the original mail . 
  stow the humor , we 're being serious right now , you american lazy worker you . 
  putin vs trump ... tough choice . 
  sorry , to me it 's simply not ... feasible to put myself in a position to have to incapacitate anyone . 
  i really do n't get this sense of paranoia you ` muricans give off . 
  sorry , ca n't remember asking for that . 
  plz gtfo . 
  such an email would never be sent by my company ... 
  i 'd be informed the boss wanted a report to date x , and if he had n't got it by then i 'd get an email asking why . 
  they actually have some sort of a native culture ... and hate it , [ even though it can be pretty cool ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mru4lrjfcsy&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=9m15s ), 
  i think it 's safe to say that these days the european equivalent of mr. trump is nigel farage . 
  would n't a taser do the job as well ? 
  this is literally a non-issue here - just irrelevant whether you fall under some part of lgbt or not . 
  imagine that shit swirling about in the hot oil , being burned into your freedom fries and your mcchickenheads of what you call them . 
  yarrr , delicious !, 
  [ anti-fryer-therapy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mezliunh_no ), 
  ever seen one of these things getting cleaned ? 
  anything that comes out of a deep-fryer should be regarded as industrial waste . 
  i went to a mcdonalds once ... never again . 
  \u00d6ttinger is a moron , i am sorry . 
  so thats why denmark is such a happy place . 
  now we know why denmark is so happy . 
  yes ... funny how assholes and religion seem to be close to each other , . 
  is n't it ? 
  finally . 
  there 's plenty of nazis though . 
  saturday is funny ... everywhere : sabbath , saturns day ... scandinavia : bath day . 
  bi\u00e4 lol, 
  thats it , thankfully res has a block option . 
  along with `` cat '' and `` pokemon '' now stands that fucking monkey . 
  the rest of the eu easily has more votes than germany and france , how can we impose anything ? 
  it even is skewed against the population !, 
  800.000 germans get the same representation as 70.000 maltese , what 's wrong with that ? 
  besides : the point of the eu is supernational democracy , not national dominance . 
  vat is 19 % here , 7 % on basic needs . 
  germany . 
  as of 2014 , germany ( 80.9 million inhabitants ) has 96 seats ( previously 99 seats ) , i.e. 
  one seat for 843,000 inhabitants . 
  malta ( 0.4 million inhabitants ) has 6 seats , i.e. 
  one seat for 70,000 inhabitants . 
  let 's see . 
  i pay income tax , atm class i since i 'm not married . 
  19/100 of my income , since progressive tax . 
  that 's about 320 $ per month . 
  for those roads are built and maintained , cultural institutions funded ( libraries , museums , theaters ) , public transport and the railroads are maintained , the police and law system runs , the various government agencies are paid . 
  the health code is controlled and inspected for instance , monuments and parks are maintained , the trees on my road are cut to shape , the postal system delivers my mail and the firefighters run on it . 
  i feel that 's a good deal . 
  the i pay workers insurance so i dont get homeless should i lose my job . 
  thats another 45 $ per month , ok , fine . 
  60 go to the retirement system to pay for what my father and others live on . 
  state health insurance is another 100 , and then i have 1200 out of my original 1800 left a month . 
  i do n't see what you 're bitching about , sorry . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_to_the_european_parliament#voting_system see ? 
  country by country , not proportional to population , not exactly in our favour if belgium gets the same amount of representation we do , is it ? 
  german dominance in the eu is a myth . 
  the only advantage germany has over its neighbors is a stronger economy . 
  no , it is a basic function of society . 
  you want healthcare , a functioning government and system of law ? 
  this is how it 's paid for . 
  and maybe you fall on hard times sometime in the future , then you will be glad for the functioning welfare system . 
  that would be actual theft ; taxation just means the state takes a little of my salary so the migrant can eat , get medical treatment and have a roof over his head , and that 's fine by me . 
  in fact i like it . 
  if that makes me a bad , bad communist for you so be it , in my own opinion it just makes me something other than an asshole . 
  besides my taxes also pay for my police force that protects me from someone stealing my wallet . 
  ok , you would rather buy a gun instead , i get it . 
  the eu is a supranational entity . 
  now we made one more step to unification by defining eu-wide taxes , this is great !, 
  now pay up , greedy apple-mofos . 
  edit : hey , cool , the article already says it all : [ klicky ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bxucqtw.png ), 
  this is ... no !, 
  taxation is redistribution , from those with the means to those with the need . 
  institutionalised solidarity , and absolutely neccessary to curb excessive greed . 
  as long as you keep your `` freedom '' over there we 're fine . 
  too bad . 
  my condolences to the turkish army . 
  about time erdogan and the religidiots are stopped . 
  long live the turkish army !, 
  blue : sane red : moron poiliticians green : fencesitters, 
  yes . 
  i prefer glaswegian to us-speech actually . 
  to be fair the ustase symbol is really , really [ ugly ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/usta%c5%a1e_symbol.svg/150px-usta%c5%a1e_symbol.svg.png ) xd, 
  and once again after an american election i find myself scartching and thinking `` and they actually elected this guy ?!! '', 
  it 's `` gott strafe england '' after all , god punish england , not god punish great britain !, 
  * ha-ahem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_submarine_u-995, 
  oh shuttup , you 're just jealous .
