  it 's what hitler said when he declared war on poland . 
   also a nice way for the goverment to make some exta bugs . 
  are you german ? 
  germans make g , d , b at the end of words sound like k , t , p. 
  probably both , patriot and populist . 
  it often goes together . 
   the notion that if you 're not an absolute subjugated globalist prepared to ignore rationality then you deserve everything bad , is scary and ridiculous . 
  no one said anything like that . 
  you are making things up . 
  if you actually think that only swiss people have a say in international treaties with switzerland , you 're wrong . 
  if the swiss want to renegotiate their side of the deal , the other countries get to renegotiate their part . 
  the fact that this will probably not go in switzerland 's favor is due the fact that their decision was incredibly stupid . 
  why are we downvoting people with a different opinion again ? 
  the comments at the bottom literally have -50 votes . 
  people here go to the bottom , open up the downvoted comments and then go `` fuck that guy for having a different opinion , let 's downvote him even harder '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , i also think euthanasia is great but there definitely are arguments against it . 
  it * is * institutionalized killing of people , and there * are * arguments to make about how it could be abused ( or has been abused by the nazis for example ) . 
  especially when you consider that children ca n't really decide on their own yet ( or so we commonly assume in society , law etc. ), 
  and it means that someone else is making a decision about life and death . 
  obviously , nothing bad * has * to happen but i think people with a different opinion have a point . 
  euthanasia , especially for not fully mentally developed people ( like children ) , definitely is one of those things you really have to be kinda paranoid about . 
  our powerful people have their money in switzerland . 
  so i 'd guess that switzerland is in a prime position to negotiate , as always . 
  now we are both sad . 
  long i is like pee/see/flee in most european languages ( it is in latin , german , spanish and the international phonetic alphabet at least ) . 
  ( in `` pine '' you are actually saying two different vowels , an a that becomes a bit like a short i. ), 
   the pronunciation differences between stuff like `` in massen '' and `` in ma\u00dfen '' are subtle . 
  \u00df = vowel before is long ss = vowel before is short not exactly rocket science . 
  but the amount of people writing fussball or scheisse is astonishing . 
  actually the least awkward way to say that sentence is `` ich habe dich geupvotet/upgevotet . '', 
  or something like that . 
  i used to hang out with finnish people in skype . 
  they even invented entirely new german insults like `` popolieber '' . 
  but , yeah , their german was n't really impressive aside from that . 
  some parts ? 
  and stone slabs in some other parts where the wall used to be . 
  and people still talk of west and east berlin , so the wall is still on peoples ' minds . 
  okay , maybe all germans are too stupid and lazy to find a safe place . 
  ... maybe they should n't produce more waste then when they are evidently unable to deal with it for whatever reason . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ however , ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ agree ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ you , ^ ^ ^ ^ nuclear ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ better ^ ^ ^ ^ than ^ ^ ^ ^ coal . 
   economic left/right : -7.38 social libertarian/authoritarian : -7.59 how do you even manage to get into the right/authoritarian spectrum with that thing ? 
  do you have to say that all black people should die and that poor people are low-quality-beings ? 
  and i considered my answers pretty authoritarian to be honest . 
  i guess that 's also true . 
  but for small things it would be rude to decline . 
  if your grandma offers you cake and you do n't like cake , you eat cake anyway . 
  if you 're having a job interview and they offer you coffee or water or whatever , you definitely accept even if you 're not thirsty or interested in it . 
   rule # 1 . 
  when you 're offered something , it 's considered polite to refuse it the first time round . 
  i am no expert on manners in german but i think it would be considered rude to decline when someone offers you something . 
  when someone says `` here , have some cake ! '', 
  and you declined , that would sound like `` i do n't want your shitty cake , fuck you '' to the other person . 
  and even if they only get 35 % , they are always the government because they always find some ~ ~ bitch ~ ~ lesser coalition partner . 
  i definitely prefer german over german pronunciation of latin . 
  which language is that ? 
  northern accents/dialect are the best . 
  drives me up the walls when i hear people pronounce the - ig in many words ( lustig , k\u00f6nig ) like - ik instead of the correct way to say it , - ich . 
   a european ftfy, 
  because they are more russian and more wealthy . 
  or so i heard in this ama here recently by the russian government employee . 
  i used to have a finnish friend . 
  his sauna-breaks were already a running joke in our `` gaming group '' . 
  when he moved to study in university he showed me his apartment via webcam . 
  and then his normal , tiny apartment had a freaking sauna . 
  it actually also made me question myself as to whether i am truly a civilized human being , considering i literally never go to the sauna . 
  do you have a sauna in your apartment ? 
  in germany it used to be the same but school time was shortened from 13 to 12 years . 
  how many years do you go to school in italy and when do you start ? 
  the only thing i do n't envy you guys for is that i believe it 's even darker where you live . 
  i do n't mind the cold but this constant darkness really is n't my thing . 
  edit : nvm , apparently god loves sweden so much he made an exception for you . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_sunshine_hours_map.png at least the norwegians are fucked . 
  then again , they have oil while we only have stupid brown coal . 
  kebab is an old dish from somewhere in the eastern mediterranean . 
  selling d\u00f6ner kebab as fast food was invented by a turkish immigrant in berlin in the early 1970s . 
  or so we 're told here in germany . 
  and lots of scandinavian / old norse . 
  you do n't sweat from casually biking . 
  it 's like walking . 
  greece had better get ready to bail us out . 
  in germany everyone was scared and they called it `` teuro '' ( teuer means expensive ) but stuff actually stayed the same price . 
  pretty sure that germany is one of the worst countries to pirate stuff in . 
  almost all music on youtube is blocked , if you torrent there are lawyers who track your ip and threaten to sue you , so torrenting is impossible ( unless you are tech savvy with plenty of proxies and shit like that ) . 
  yeah , that 's why sweden , denmark and the uk have such shitty economies and in germany everyone is rich . 
  uk , denmark & sweden also all desperately want to have the euro because of how much they can profit by exploiting `` weaker '' economies , just like germany . 
  really weird to give the currency with 3 digits after the comma . 
  ( and it is 118.956,14 $ ), 
  some context would have been nice . 
  basically , the former greece deputy director of the mod 's procurement office ( number 2 official for the ministry of defense ) accepted lots of bribes from different arms manufacturers in germany , sweden and russia . 
  i do n't even know what `` ebm '' is . 
  k-pop ? 
   also ( ` eien ' is not dutch for eggs , that would be ` eieren ' . 
  yeah ) eieren sounds like two plurals to me ( a german ) . 
  1 ei , 2 eier in german . 
  what is the singular form of eieren ? 
  like children , where childr is already plural but then they made it children . 
  childrens would be 3 plurals . 
  i also dislike questions like  should academic standards be harmonised throughout the eu ? 
  harmonise is such a nice word . 
  of course people want harmony .
