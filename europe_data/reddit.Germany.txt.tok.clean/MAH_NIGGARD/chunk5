  and she is not the only one that behaves like this in our country . 
  they live for their entire lives in moldova and dont know a word in romanian . 
  thats just pure pig behavior . 
  imagine you were `` russian '' in moldova . 
  your parents are `` russians '' in moldova . 
  your friends all speak russian . 
  you were born there and maybe your parents as well . 
  the majority of the people in your area might be russian . 
  why would you not rather be part of russia ? 
  ~ 60 years is a long fucking time . 
  it 's a lifetime . 
  it 's the difference between modern germany and the third reich . 
  * probably *, 
  they treat their employees like shit though . 
  they get money from the state until they have as much as they would have had if they did n't work . 
  so their work does n't actually give them anything financially . 
  it also means that the state essentially subsidizes low pay . 
  i 'm no expert but german historians make a point of not calling it `` machtergreifung '' but `` macht\u00fcbergabe '' or something like that instead . 
  so in english something like : hitler did n't `` take '' power , it was `` given '' to him . 
  i do n't understand patriotism either . 
  am i supposed to be proud of kant because he spoke german like me or van gogh because he lived closer to where i grew up ? 
  am i proud of french people ? 
  or at least danish ? 
  or only german ? 
  or only where the modern german borders are ? 
  or am i only to be proud of local talent from the city i grew up in ? 
  or the city i live in now ? 
  what exactly is it that i am supposed to be proud of ? 
  what 's the point of patriotism ? 
   well , he was n't actually elected democratically really . 
  he got a third of the vote yeah . 
  he got a third of the votes . 
  way more than any other party . 
  not even close actually . 
  not to mention that even other conservative parties ( center party , monarchy party ) were in favor of hitler . 
  everyone apart from the social democrats voted in favor of the erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz ( that gave the legislation to the executive powers ( aka hitler ) ) there was massive support from the population . 
  hitler did n't hire a bunch of soldiers and subdued all germans . 
  they wanted it . 
  ( obviously there also was terrorism , intimidation etc. 
  from the nsdap . 
  but that 's only part of how hitler came to power . ), 
  yeah , i agree . 
  if it is propaganda , it is propaganda against russia by europeans . 
  to make us europeans go `` oh look how stupid and backwards them russians are '' . 
  putin can speak german fluently . 
  [ putin in the bundestag . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2frvopgwxf0&amp;t=2m35s ), 
  yeah , fuel is just 1,50 $ / liter . 
  at this point , they might as well give it away for free . 
   trains . 
  not just the ice high-speed train . 
  deutsche bahn own a lot of railway operators in the uk now . 
  siemens have also supplied a lot of trains in the uk since we privatised everything . 
  [ sis tr\u00e4in is \u00e4t se moment ... ten minits dil\u00e4it !, 
  ( germans making fun of the `` gay '' voice and accent ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-byzppcr0kq&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m30s ), 
  unlike pennsylvanian dutch , texas german is really easy to understand . 
  the boy was shot in * the * foot . 
  and he suggested * watching * a movie . 
  you 're right . 
  - they invented the metric system - code napol\u00e9on german-french stuff : - the french accent in german is easily the best accent/dialect - when you learn french as a german , you know half the words from english - the second-most learned foreign language in germany is french - germany and france are buddies politically and economically - germans like france , french do n't really like germany but respect it - france and germany have the only transnational , state-funded tv ~ ~ program ~ ~ channel , arte, 
  as far as i know france insisted on germany having to join and make the euro if it wanted to reunite west and east germany . 
  supposedly to weaken germany because a strong germany has historically been not so good for ... well , everyone . 
  i really do n't think that 's true . 
  most people , for example here on reddit , achieve some kind of `` fluency '' in english and then completely stop improving . 
  `` the boy was shot in his foot '' for example might sound absolutely correct to most non-native speakers . 
  most foreigners would probably even accept `` he suggested to watch a movie '' and stuff like that . 
  natives usually do n't make these kinds of mistakes . 
  in germany the bnd is mostly famous for being very bad at what they do . 
  i believe in sardinia some people actually still speak some form of catalan . 
  it 's mostly about the lyrics . 
  right now , their anthem basically is a prayer . 
  yeah , some foreign and loanwords are in the german dictionary . 
  yeah , those are all foreign words , are n't they ? 
  from english , greek etc. 
  because we do n't say y in regular words . 
  it does n't exist in german . 
  in foreign words we say it like i , \u00fc or j. 
   putin in june signed a law that prohibits in russia the distribution of ... creative sentence structure . 
  but you 're a real country with nearly your own language  good point , though . 
  no punishment without guilt . 
  punishing people for something they have n't done is questionable to say the least . 
  if i was a micro state in europe that makes money from being a tax haven , i definitely would n't want to be part of the eu . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/far-right_politics  the most extreme right-wing movements have pursued oppression and genocide against groups of people on the basis of their alleged inferiority . 
  luckily the nazis did n't do that . 
  where do you put `` murdering socialists '' on your list of things that proof nazis are socialists ? 
  welcome to / r/europe where people actually argue that the nazis were n't right and that they were socialists . 
  we also write `` dschungel '', 
  i live in east-ish germany and the only people working here are polish . 
  ( slight exaggeration ) . 
  i 'm german , so obviously i am not allowed to hate minorities and i actually do n't . 
  but all contact that i have had with gypsies was 1 . groups of them `` assaulting '' you in your car when you are waiting at traffic lights to `` clean '' your windows . 
  if you give them money , they clean you windows in a shitty way that will mean you will have to clean your windows , if you do n't , they scratch them 2 . beggars pretending to be ill , disabled etc. 
  while being perfectly healthy or people molesting you till you give them money 3 . thiefs , pickpockets etc. 
  actually there may have been a few in circuses , so that 's a plus i guess . 
  do n't get me wrong , i do n't hate them , and i am thankful for every border gone . 
  but it 's easily the group of people that i have heard the least good stuff about ( about none ) . 
  maybe the `` good '' roma just do n't stand out that much and do n't make their heritage a topic . 
  but they do n't seem to build things , they do n't make delicious food like turks or greeks or italians or asians or just about anyone else . 
  so , they might be good , productive people , but they have the worst reputation of ... everyone . 
  ca n't think of an ethnic group with a worse reputation .
