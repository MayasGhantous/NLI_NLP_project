it seems like ( assumptions , like everything ) it was a relationship related incident . 
  earlier emergency calls were about a couple arguing . 
  and the machete is probably from the kebab restaurant . 
  i think you need to accept the thought that not every crime commited by a muslim is is or islam related . 
  its the trend right now to act like this . 
  the media reports about it almost like commercials , and the victim count like a highscore . 
  if you were a loser in the past , you had no real options other than get rich or die trying with illegal stuff . 
  today they have the opportunity to be somebody , to do this bullshit . 
  another point is : why would `` they '' lie to us ? 
  `` they '' have family and friends as well and `` they '' probably do n't want to live in a war . 
  so , in my opinion , `` they '' have no reason to lie . 
  thats why i believe most things you were counting as lies . 
  the is is not that strong and omnipresent . 
  most of it would be brought to the public sooner or later anyway . 
  one native stabing another native = fighting it out = not so bad . 
  one refugee/imigrant stabing someone = bringing war into european lands = bad . 
  why is there a difference for you who did it ? 
  blame the person , not their background . 
  otherwise we would need to kill all christians , with all those crimes they commit in europe . 
  i know many moderate muslims . 
  and me and my family , even the women , are doing just fine . 
  thanks for the prayer tho !, 
  ouch ... 
  there is so much wrong in your sentence . 
  so thats the definition you invented . 
  innocent people . 
  the fbi definition defines it as a shooting with af least 4 victims ( as far as i remember , you can look it up ) . 
  it does n't matter if the victims were innocent or not . 
  with the fbi definition those were not mass shootings although . 
  but i doubt that the victims care about that , or about your personal freedom . 
  equality would be if every state could start a 7 year ruling now , not just the uk . 
  edit : they actually can . 
  my bad . 
  ask the victims of these shootings if they were shot with a bb gun . 
  so what definition do you want to use in order to be right ? 
  well ... ** july 19 ** , 2016 - arkansas - [ west memphis ] ( http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/32483894/4-people-shot-in-west-memphis-drive-by ) ** july 20 ** , 2016 - california - [ fresno ] ( http://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/three-men-shot-a-fourth-wounded-by-shrapnel-in-se-fresno ) ** july 21 ** , 2016 - illinois - [ chicago ] ( http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/four-wounded-in-austin-shooting/ ) ** july 23 ** , 2016 - ohio - [ cincinnati ] ( http://www.wcpo.com/news/crime/homicide-unit-called-to-south-cumminsville-shooting ), 
  you seem to missed half of his post . 
  so lets just risk those jobs through an uncertain and probably worse economic future ? 
  what do you understand under cultural integration ? 
  and politically , at least in germany , there is a 5 % represantation . 
  with some parties as high as 15 % . 
  compared to the ~ 15 % migrant population thats not that bad . 
  so being integrated means for you to have no different opinion ? 
  that is not even assimilation . 
  so you want to stay in the eea but no freedom of movement ? 
  good luck . 
  man . 
  you need to trust redditors . 
  those experts do n't know jack . 
  you seem to think making a referendum is like rolling a dice . 
  if the people who voted still think the same way , there 's no need to be afraid . 
  if they do n't want to leave , they wo n't just stop talking about it . 
  there will be `` good '' reasons to wait , until something happens what will change the whole situation , and then the referendum is worthless . 
  at least that 's what they say . 
  the government . 
  well , they can make you forget it way easier than you might think, 
  could n't care less . 
   so what you are saying is suicide bombings have something to do with islam ? 
  it is , as far as i know , typical for radial islam . 
   also there 's nothing in the bible about killing people because of their skin colour lawl there is nothing in the koran telling people to blow themselves up in order to kill other people ** lawl ** . 
  you are right tho , not skin colour . 
  just [ standard racism ] ( https://whistlinginthewind.org/2012/05/03/terrible-parts-of-the-bible-part-5-racism/ ) . 
   the kkk were n't fans of catholics so yeah ? 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/21/virginia-kkk-fliers_n_5008647.html  this is an islam problem again , no it is not . 
  see my last post . 
  you ignore the people and their lives , in addition to other religious terrorist groups . 
   who lie to themselves only do harm . 
  this is you . 
  sorry brothi , but i am not lying to myself . 
  you want to make a different religion an enemy ( old christian habits i guess ) and disregard the reality . 
   you should read about stalinist russia and learn how the people there lied to themselves on a regular basis to keep functioning - it might give you some perspective on what lefties are doing to themselves now . 
  yeah . 
  my position is comparable to people living in the udssr . 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  catholics do n't use suicide bombs . 
  that is something for the radical islam . 
  christians only kill people because of their skin colour ( kkk ) and [ other stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_terrorism ) comparable to radical islam . 
  if you stop focusing on the religion and start seeing the people , you will see many similarities . 
  many people in the west think that people who do harm deserve to be harmed . 
  may it be trough killing their families ( like trump , the newly elected president , said ) or wars . 
  and the worse your life is , the more you search for someone who you can blame it on . 
  and that is how we get those high numbers in the middle east . 
  and with all those different percentages in each * country * - not religion - , you think that it all depends on the religion ? 
  oh come on . 
  you got the numbers right in front of you . 
  if it had something to do with their religion , the numbers would n't be so different . 
  or is your point , that there are some bad muslims ? 
  i could have told you that without those numbers . 
  but let me tell you something else : there are bad people in every religion . 
  that 's his point . 
  good job sherlock !, 
  living in a state is not a service and not a private company . 
  someone has to pay for infrastructure etc. 
  ( unlike milk ) , so it is fair to share the costs accordingly to the available money . 
  surprise !, 
  the war is certainly nothing to laugh about . 
  this talk here on the other side ... 
   possibly drunk got any information on this ? 
  using deaths for their political agenda ? 
  which movement does this , besides the far right ?
