really ? 
  i have the exact opposite experience about those named countries ( well okay except the swiss ) especially poles were always pretty open and welcoming . 
  on the other side the amount of people i met from spain and especially portugal who still believed in the blood rule are quite a bit frightening . 
  no seriously you are not better because you are born in certain borders . 
  compared to southern countries ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  germany takes more refugees and spents more money than all the * southern countries * combined , which is not hard when a country like portugal takes less than 100 refugees and spents only 50000 $ for help [ source ] ( http://syrianrefugees.eu/?page_id=10 ), 
   alternative f\u00fcr deutschland that 's more than unlikely . 
  lucke said already that he will not work together with people like le pen , because they have different goals . 
   german tv coverage will be back at 22:00 for european results . 
  [ tagesschau24 ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/livestreams/index.html ) covered it since 17:45 and will until 21:30 . 
  they report about other countries in the moment ( france is in the spotlight at the moment ) . 
  and at 21:00 [ phoenix ] ( http://www.phoenix.de/livestream/ ) will continue their coverage . 
  some alternatives if you do n't want to wait until the zdf continues their coverage . 
   bayern munich matches fyi bayern m\u00fcnchen is a jewish club and was pursued by the nazis . 
  go read up on kurt landauer and the football scene as a whole in munich if you want to know more . 
  not that it would have help your argument if you would have used on of those actual * arbeitervereinen * who sited with the nazi , because there is a huge difference between the armenian genocide and the holocaust . 
  you should really give it another try . 
  i do n't watch much tv anymore , but when i do , i usually watch phoenix . 
  `` der tag '' is really a nice daily summary even though it comes a bit late . 
  true and the tagesschau is dumbed down version of the rtl2 news . 
  no seriously , phoenix has by far the best political coverage in german tv ( and btw . 
  a bigger market share than n24 ) . 
  may it be `` phoenix vor ort '' , `` der tag '' , `` unter den linden '' and the `` phoenix runde '' is the best coverage about politics we got in germany . 
  they show every discussion in the bundestag , only their discussion groups try to show every side of the argument ( during the ukraine crisis they have a former us diplomat and a former russian diplomat to present their viewpoint ) . 
  i simply ca n't understand how someone could call phoenix a dumbed down n24 ... n24 is literally the rtl2 of news channels . 
  not only that . 
  the decision for the phase out was made before fukushima . 
  only the extended running time for the nuclear power plants was revoked . 
  and germany does n't need gas for energy production . 
  only around 10 % came from gas ( and only 25-30 % came from nuclear energy ) . 
  germany uses the gas mostly for heating . 
   to create money , collateral is left at the central bank . 
  you mean the fractional reserve requirements , right ? 
  the ecb rate for the * mindestreserve * is at 1 % right now . 
  somewhat not the amount of collateral which is an effective regulation , no ? 
   the central bank ** lends ** out central bank money at a rate related to economic growth so that ** interest ** can be paid back by using the newly created wealth . 
  see that is the problem i have . 
  central banks created ( lets say ) 1000 $ and want back 1000 $ plus an 100 $ as the interest rate . 
  the demands 1100 $ while they only created 1100 $ in the same time ? 
  how is this sustainable ? 
  well you could say that the inflation will even it out , too bad that there is also the * zinseszins * . 
  well since you can apparently understand german you could watch some youtube videos from dirk m\u00fcller , who is someone which describe the problem better than i could . 
  ( here is an [ example ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cvkquap1q0 ) with prof. h\u00f6rmann ) m\u00fcller tries to educate people about the debt money problematic for quite some time now and does a good thing at it . 
   a greek female soldier has more arm-strength than a modern effeminate northern european `` male '' a i see you are a racist . 
  let me guess it is because their blood is purer ? 
  may i asked if you have called yourself 86mitso on reddit in the past ? 
  well according to my friend from greece the common people did it too . 
  from doctors , to cab drivers , to house builders , literally everyone . 
  he told me that people who paid all of their taxes where considered as dumb , because it is only fair if the elite does the same . 
  not to mention the fakelaki which you needed to pay if you want that something gets done . 
   yet germans like to spread hate on the average greek citizen and yet it is the greeks who calls us nazis , burn german flags , attack the ambassador ( which was n't the first diplomat who got attacked ) . 
  or tourist like that poor dutch who got stabbed because some greeks thought he was a german tourist, 
  ah you use an opinion to present them as facts ? 
  how about [ this opinion ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2013/11/15/germany-bashing-with-bad-economics-and-wrong-facts/ ) your first fault is to put greece , spain , ireland and portugal together , your second that you refer to an article which sees the target2 balance as real loans . 
  maybe you should check what target2 actually is . 
  but for now , lets return to the facts for greece , because the situation for spain and ireland is quite different , and the claim not that wrong for those 2 countries . 
  but this is an article about greeks attacking the german ambassador and i was strictly talking about greece . 
  here is an [ source ] ( http://www.dw.de/greek-creditors-receive-official-haircut-notification/a-15767530 ) for the 50 % haircut [ here ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/62432000/gif/_62432142_eurozone_chart624x325.gif ) is an graph from the bbc about the of contribution of the foreign investments for greece . 
  as you can see french banks invested 40 billions compared to the 7 billions from german banks . 
  and yet it was a bailout for german banks ? 
  btw : the second help program for greece was [ worth 165 billion ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/assistance_eu_ms/greek_loan_facility/ ) alone . 
   it takes two to tango . 
  since the start of financialisation in the 70s there has been an increase in household debt worldwide . 
  would you also say that is somehow also a moral failure of the people ? 
  did people become suddenly immoral ? 
  or is the problem at least partly systemic ? 
  of course there is a systematic failure . 
  we use * debt money * after all . 
  every 5 year old should realize that our monetary syastem is not sustainable . 
  money is created with debt , and for every 100 $ created the demands gets bigger than the amount of money which exists . 
  you do n't need to be a rocket scientist to realize that a reset is needed at somepoint . 
  but that is n't the topic right now , is it ? 
  the sovereign country greece is to blame for their current situation . 
  other countries decided to do other things . 
  after greece entered the eurozone they could get cheap money and took more loans than can repay . 
  greece did n't use those loans to reform their country , but to hire more public servant since your politicians promised as much as voting gifts and to enrich your elite even more . 
  germany could have done the same , but he did our reforms when the world economy was n't struggling . 
  it appears that it was the smart thing to do , something one can not say about greece . 
  greece needed similar reforms and could have done so when they had access to cheap money , instead of having a big `` party '' and wasting all the money . 
  those reforms would still be painful but not as close as it is right now . 
  it is your fault to wait that long to do the reforms . 
   that 's the fault of the greek and the greek system allright . 
  that does not prove that the debt crisis is a result from that . 
  countries refinance itself by taxing their population . 
  if you avoid paying your taxes and still want a social safety net , your country need to take loans to do so . 
  if the citizens of greece decided to pay what they should and not to dodge taxes , the government would n't have needed to take as many loans to keep their country running . 
   you know almost all countries did the same right regarding the eurozone , right ? 
  faking numbers is despicable but hardly unique to greece . 
  just the other day we were talking here in / r/europe about how germany fakes its unemployment numbers . 
  no i do n't know that almost all countries did the same , in fact i am convinced that greece was the only country who did so . 
  well the european commission is not blameless . 
  but the action started from greece which decided that they need to have the euro . 
  could you tell me which other countries lied to their partners about the criteria to enter the monetary union ? 
  a lot of country did broke the rules , italy 's debt was bigger than it should , france and germany ( and many others ) broke the deficit rule but none of those reported wrong numbers . 
  i hope you see a difference in both actions . 
  also what has germany unemployment numbers to do with it ? 
  how do they influence european neighbors ? 
  the numbers are lower because the german government have a definition about employment , most people disagree with , but they are not betraying their european partners with it . 
  did i say anything like that ?
