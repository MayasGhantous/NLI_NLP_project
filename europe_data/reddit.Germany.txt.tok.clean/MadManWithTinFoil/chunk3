  we should ensure that it continue to help them in the future and not only for a short time . 
  while i would consider those articles more as opinions than fact based article ( both by the same author saying the same ) . 
  nevertheless i will accept it ( and ignore is statement that germany started world war1 ) this is the part this thread is about  ritschl : the german bankruptcies in the last century show that the sensible thing to do now would be to have a real reduction of the debt . 
  so lets look at the facts this article is from june 2011 and in [ october 2011 greece got a real reduction of debt . 
  ] ( http://articles.marketwatch.com/2011-10-27/markets/30693186_1_greek-debt-euro-zone-euro-zone ) should i link an article about the junka and say we have to stop every aid package because europe should n't support a dictatorship ? 
  how about we skip that and do n't use outdated article for a discussion ? 
  could you stick to the facts if you want to achieve something ? 
   the money went straight from german taxpayers to german banks who held greek debt . 
  first of greek banks were the ones holding most of your debt and french banks the biggest foreign investor ( who even borrowed money from german banks to reinvest more in greece ) . 
  german banks hold around 23 billions $ in greek bonds and unlike the french banks they kept most of it and did n't * sold * it to the ecb . 
  and they were forced like every private investore to write off more than 50 % of those bonds ( talking about debt cancellation greek apparently never got ) . 
  which would mean german tax payer would need to pay for 11,5 billion $ , if we assume that the tax payer would need to cover all of their loans . 
  so a quick google search told me that the all the bailout packages for greece reached a total amount of 240 billion $ !, 
  germany 's contribution to the esm is a bit more than 25 % , and to make it easier i simply assume it was the same with esfs . 
  the amount germany give via iwf is a lot smaller and the ecbs part a bit higher though . 
  so lets keep it simple and say that germany gives 20 % of those 240 billion . 
  i am not that good in math , but 20 % of 240 billion is a lot more than 11,5 billion , no ? 
  it is more like 48 billions . 
  do you still want to say that the german tax payer money went straight back to german banks ? 
  let 's be honest here . 
  not many germans think that there is n't needed something else to help to ease the pain for the crisis country . 
  most realize that greece will never be able to pay back all of its loans ( this is why we were a bit angry at samaras when he personally gave us his guarantee that greece will pay all of it back ) . 
  ecb and imf revealed as much last year , even merkel herself gave hints that there will be more debt cancellation ( yes more it does n't help your point if you forget the 54 % write off from the private sector ) . 
  you should also realize that no german politician will kill his career for something which is n't needed immediately , but if you insist to have it now , you always can show europe the finger and default . 
   it is economically supreme , but culturally negligible . 
  is that so ? 
   next to nobody is learning german as a foreign language . 
  really ? 
  and i thought the goethe institute ca n't keep up with all the application . 
   `` they 're living on empty , culturally , '' says winder . 
  `` there 's no german novel i 'm looking forward to , and no german film . 
  it is interesting that simon winder ca n't even speak german , and yet thinks he is qualified to make such statement . 
   early on in the book , he confesses that he has never really managed to get his head around the compound nouns and modal particles of the german language [ source ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/27/germania-personal-history-simon-winder ) no wonder that he does n't await german books , he could n't read it !, 
  and yet he wants to judge german culture ? 
  what an awful article by the guardian, 
  [ what difference ? 
  a chart showing the growth of the us and ez should tell me exactly what ? 
  that austerity does n't cause economic growth ? 
  and this is newsworthy ? 
  why ? 
  since when is austerity supposed to cause growth ? 
  do you really understand the meaning behind austerity ? 
  is n't it there to cut your spending , because your are broke and ca n't afford to continue your spending and depend on foreign countries ? 
  structural reforms should cause growth , but unlike spending cash , you do n't have , growth does n't start overnight that way . 
  in fact it could take decades until you see some progress . 
  it is okay if you think austerity is too painfully for your country . 
  this will be your decision and it is only you who can decided that . 
  but please stop with the underlying massage that it is the responsibility of foreign taxpayers to fix your misery , because it 's not . 
  you guys should really make up your mind now !, 
  this will be an important decision and it will effect your future for decades . 
  first you have to accept that you ca n't go on like in previous years and this is not debatable , the capital market does n't want to lent you money in a way you would need it . 
  you have ( probably ) 2 ways out of the crisis . 
  accept the austerity and realign your economy with painful structure reforms and decades of hardship ** in ** the eurozone or start your own us style stimulus with your own currency ** outside ** of the eurozone . 
  you should also keep in mind that oil wo n't be trade in your new currency and printing your way out of the crisis could have another effect than it has in the us , not to mention an euro exit will have unpredictable reactions from the markets and since every country depends on those market this could be bad for us ** all ** , but at least you could finally show it to us , no ? 
  those are your options ( both have pros and cons ) , but the 100s of billion in foreign tax money are not your alternative ( and its probably not billions but trillions which will be needed to fix it the way you want it ) . 
  that would be our alternative if we want to stop you from leaving , but it should be obvious that the northern tax payer does n't want that , which you will have to accept , like we have to accept your decision if you want to leave the currency union . 
   because it was not obvious that there was a problem at the time ? 
  is that so ? 
  no one knew that the greeks had a problem with collecting taxes and corruption ? 
  or that italy need reforms in their labour market , lower their debt level and make a serious effort to fight corruption , too ? 
  i must have imagine the fights between germany and france to allow italy to join the euro . 
  but you surly must be joking if you think no one knew about the youth unemployment in spain . 
  [ just look at the numbers from the past ] ( http://data.un.org/data.aspx?q=spain+youth+unemployment&amp;d=mdg&amp;f=seriesrowid%3a597%3bcountryid%3a724 ) . 
  even before they joined the euro the youth unemployment was always over 20 % !, 
  how can you say no one knew about it ? 
  sorry i do n't buy that excuse . 
   could germany perform those same reforms today instead of in 2003-05 ? 
  maybe , maybe not , but i think you are asking the wrong question . 
  why not ask for the reasons the club med waited for so long until they started their reforms ? 
  no one stopped them from doing the same thing germany did ( and yes it is a lot easier to do reforms before it is to late ) . 
  they even could have done it without foreign tax money , because they had still access to * cheap money * from the capital markets . 
  a lot of their problems did n't appear over night . 
  why have they waited until they had no other options left and how can we prevent something like that in the future ? 
  those are the question of interest ( for me ) . 
  politicians should do the right thing and not the most popular , is probably one of the issues . 
  germany got lucky that schr\u00f6der was n't afraid of unpopular decision , but blaming countries who acted smartly does not help said countries one bit . 
  you are only looking at one side of the medal . 
  a stronger euro would n't automatically mean that the product would get more expensive . 
  sounds odd does n't it ? 
  take a closer look at what we exactly export . 
  it is mostly high-tech products , chemicals , machine tools and other luxury things . 
  those things do n't grew on trees and we have to import the raw materials and the energy we need in the manufacturing progress for it . 
  and they would become cheaper with a stronger euro , which basically means the production cost would decrease and we would be able to adjust the prices of our products . 
  and not only that , a stronger $ would also strengthen our internal market , which means the citizens could afford to buy all the nice things we manufacture , simply because we would have more money available ( which would be a great thing because it would improve our trade * in * balance ) . 
  i have a small problem with that . 
  i mostly wonder where was the solidarity after the ussr ceased to exist ? 
  eastern europe was in ruins , but i have n't seen much talk about solidarity back then . 
  and i honestly think , that those eastern europeans would have deserved those 100 of billions $ more than any ez member right now . 
  yet it was perfectly fine to let them suffer until they get out off their misery by themselves ? 
  where was the difference from now ? 
  i also must have missed the solidarity when germany had its reunification , too . 
  if i remember it correctly germany underestimated the cost of reunification greatly and asked its friends if it would be acceptable if germany would temporally pay less into the eu budget . 
  but our friends ( especially our spanish one ) denied us even that . 
  germany did n't asked for money they simply wanted to pay less ( temporally ! ), 
  and even that was not acceptable !, 
  scandinavians and the dutch also had to do ( painful ) reforms afaik . 
  there was no european solidarity , too . 
  the willingness to help our friends would be bigger if the club med would have shown some solidarity with other countries themselves in the past . 
  they had more than 1 chance to do so . 
  so why exactly should i feel the need to help my * friends * ?
