  because they are so creative with insulting me ? 
  and who has to pay 7 % ? 
  [ certainly not the greeks ] ( http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2012/11/27/eurogroup-3-bailout-tranches-in-4-tranches-a-drop-in-the-ocean-of-e319-bn-debt/ )  2 ) deferral of greek interest payments on efsf loans by 10 years . 
  cut to the interest rates greece is paying on loans from its international partners : a ) lower by 100 basis points the interest rate greece is paying on its greek loan facility -- the loans it received on its first bailout package -- from 2.5 % to 0.75 % . 
  b ) cutting interest rates even further once the country reached a primary surplus , currently projected to happen in 2014 . 
  this will help greece to pay 600 million eur less per year , 5 billion eur in 8 years . 
  ** edit : ** [ this source \\ ( in german \\ ) ] ( http://www.wiwo.de/politik/europa/euro-hilfe-portugal-versucht-die-griechische-loesung-/7460078.html ) claims that the standard interest rate from the efsf is between 1,5-2 % ( it also says that portugal wants the same treatment like greece , which is more than understandable ) . 
  which seems to be a rather good deal seeing how much countries like italy and spain has to pay for 10year bonds . 
   massive ( usury ) levels of interest rates ? 
  2.5 % was usury ? 
  that is 0,5 above inflation ? 
  how much wanted the * free markets * during that time ? 
  what a rip-off !, 
  and while i saw your complains about those criminal rates a few time , here are some news from last november : [  2 \\ ) deferral of greek interest payments on efsf loans by 10 years . 
  cut to the interest rates greece is paying on loans from its international partners : a ) lower by 100 basis points the interest rate greece is paying on its greek loan facility -- the loans it received on its first bailout package -- from 2.5 % to 0.75 % .

[ these include cutting the interest rate on loans to greece , and returning 11bn euros to athens in profits from ecb purchases of greek government bonds . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20506251 ) those are truly criminal interest rates !, 
  they are not only less then the inflation , countries like spain and italy also have to borrow the money for the loans from the market at higher rates . 
  i understood lagarde in an other way . 
  it sounded like she wants to see germans to be able to consume more . 
  and in my limited world view , inflation is just a more hidden tax . 
  she ca n't mean inflation with my understanding , since it is just another form of taxation . 
  and that is why it does n't make any sense . 
  germans will have to pay quite a lot in order to help fixing europe ( and while i really do n't like the course of the discussion in europe , i still see it as a good investment if it 's done right ) . 
  lagardes statements sounds more than progaganda to score a few points and change their bad image . 
   germany and other countries `` can afford to move ahead with consolidation at a slower pace than others , '' can we ? 
  the imf also thinks a second haircut is needed for greece ( and i want to add that only the taxpayers in europe should take the hit , since imf and the ecb wont accept to take a hit ) . 
  and i am pretty sure they will get the haircut , because the debt level of greece is simply to high . 
  greece will need to do a few more reform to win a bit more trust and also have to wait till germany have elected a new/old chancellor , because i ca n't see merkel ruining her chance to get reelected . 
  and while lagarde has a point , i would like to know how we should pay for the haircut , a growth program and also fund the esm ? 
  you are somewhat right , i think ( personally ) that a break up of the euro would lead to a german default . 
  the european economies are heavily connected to each other , a lot of german money is invested outside of germany ( in fact , captial flowed out of the country since the creation of the euro , germany was the second biggest capital exporter behind china ) . 
  a break up would destroy a lot of money , and i do n't think many german banks and corporations could survive that . 
  i also assume that germany would n't be the only country how need to default in that scenario , since not only germany has invested a lot of money in other european countries . 
  i see a good chance of a mass default in europe , and only jebus knows what the consequences would mean for the global economy and the capital markets world wide . 
  and yet i have to disagree with you when you write that germany should be doing more to keep the euro alive . 
  it is not up to us to fix the problem , the giips countries need to do their reforms to sustain the eurozone . 
  we will buy them time for it but that 's it . 
  greece will get another haircut , because their debt level is not sustainable and everyone knew that ( a lot of germans made even fun of samaras when he gave out a guarantee that greece will pay back all of its credits ) . 
  this time the taxpayers across europe will pay for the haircut , and while most people wont like it , there is no way to avoid it . 
  and spain will be allowed to use the esm to finance their `` bad banks '' . 
  that is already a lot of aid , and i have n't even mentioned portugal and the other ez countries in trouble . 
  and there is n't support for even more aid . 
  especially seeing the lack of responsibility , the blame `` everyonebutourself '' game and the pure hatred towards germany . 
  and since you mentioned that the euro is still overvalued for southern europe , ubs had a study with nice graphs . 
  you can see [ the income growth in the eurozone ] ( http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5030e87d6bb3f7c83b000002/image.png ) . 
  and maybe that has something to do with the euro being to expansive for the club med ? 
  you can also see why the german politicians will have trouble to explain a further decrease of our living standard to the voters . 
  we had to do a internal devaluation to stay competitive and after a decade we should do it again so we can subside other countries ? 
   they effectively devalued their currency , with a currency worth twice as much as the dm . 
  our dm was never worth more than the dollar . 
  and you will surely claim that the dm would now be worth more than the euro on its own . 
  in return i am going to ask you why the euro was worth more than the dm in the first place ? 
  i do n't think the value of a currencies is calculated the way most people think it is . 
  on a sidenote , with a stronger currency we would not only strengthen our domestic market ( you know we germans actually could afford to buy all those nice things ) we could also import more cheaply , which is also important for our export . 
  mostly because we do n't export things which grown on trees , and need a lot of raw materials and energy product . 
  and that would lower the cost our products . 
  back in the days when the $ was worth around 1,6 $ people here were concerned that the $ could be become so expensive that it could hurt our exports . 
  during that time i read a study where they came to the conclusion that our corporations would n't have a problem if the $ would be worth up to 30 % more . 
  they used the reasoning i tried to describe above . 
  sadly i ca n't find the study right now , than again i do n't know if you would be interested in a german study . 
  i also want to add that there is a problem with your assumption that german goods are competitive because of the euro . 
  if this would be true , there would n't be a need to adjust our economy with reforms under schr\u00f6der , the euro would have done that for us . 
  but we all know that germans had to go through the `` agenda 2010 '' reforms , which not only meant having a decade without pay rise , we also had to adjust our welfare programs . 
  there are other reasons german corporations have benefited from the $ . 
   for example i think the most expensive film in german language is `` das boot '' with a budget of $ 14 million . 
  [ cloud atlas ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/ ) cost around 100 million and is a german production . 
  it is not a movie in the german language , but it can show that there would be more money available for german movies . 
  it is simply not worth making such expensive films only in german . 
  afaik most countries do n't dub foreign movies and a lot of people do n't enjoy reading subtitles , so their market is not as big as a movie in english . 
  the ifo business climate is not only a survey about the current status , they also ask the participant about their expectations [ you can read here ] ( http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifohome/facts/survey-results/business-climate/calculating-the-ifo-business-climate.html ) who they calculate it . 
  [ and here ] ( http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifohome/facts/survey-results/business-climate/geschaeftsklima-archiv/2012/geschaeftsklima-20121219.html ) is the current report , where they also mentioned that * `` they are far more optimistic about the future than previously . 
   i play too many pdox games ... those pdox stand for paradox games ? 
  than i do n't think this is possible  beside that , thanks for you comment . 
  it is good to see that there are also british people , who share my view . 
  plus i do think that european politics are all about compromises and the middle way between all european countries would lead us to a better future . 
  counterbalance to germany ? 
  funny , i would say we need them as a counterbalance against the clubmed and especially france . 
  as a german i actually thing there are more similarities between the british and the german `` vision '' than between germany and france . 
  actually i would describe the german position in the middle of the france and the british one . 
  seeing that the uk want to cut spending even more , i really do n't see how they will be a counterbalance in the way most european want it . 
   the opposition social democrats and greens are for minimum wages . 
  not so fast here . 
  yes you are right we will not get a minimum wage from both the cdu and especiallly not from the fdp . 
  ** but ** do n't start thinking you will get one by voting for the spd . 
  yes the spd is talking about a minimum wage but keep in mind that we have a election next year . 
  looking at the pools right now , there is a high possibility that we will get a grand coalition . 
  the last time we got one the spd has n't pushed for a minimum wage when it was part of a coalition with the cdu . 
  oh and do you remember the time between kohl and merkel ? 
  there was this guy , people seem to forget . 
  he gave us the agenda 2010 instead of a minimum wage . 
  not that i want to argue with you against a minimum wage , but i do n't think we will get something like that anytime soon . 
   either german wages need to rise i fail to see how that would help europe . 
  we have n't lowered our wages in the last decade , because it sounded like fun . 
  our economy had quite some troubles ( you will probably remember the sick man of europe reports ) . 
  comparing it on a european level i would agree that there is room for an increase of german wages , but we live in a globalized world and the world does n't end at european borders anymore . 
  it is true that our wages do increase for the first time in a decade , but they wont increase to a level other european economies would need it . 
  not that i am against earning more , but i still think that germany would get problems .
