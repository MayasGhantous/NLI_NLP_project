  and greece . 
  and it gives these people lives that are above the ones of dogs . 
   ... and it 's not an example any other country wishes to follow ... 
  except france , sweden , finland , belgium , luxemburg , austria , hungary . 
  all have higher numbers than they should have . 
   ... it is nothing to be proud of ... yeah i see that you are really proud of the humongous sacrifices that denmark is willing to take . 
  really ? 
  who knocked on your door until 2001 ? 
  and all of a sudden , you start saying `` nah , it 's hungary 's problem , we do n't give a fuck . '', 
  makes sense . 
  keep on saving lives , bro . 
  she said that syrians can stay . 
  and she did that for a reason , because there is a fucking war in syria , if you have n't noticed yet . 
  for syrians , there is no limit , that is correct . 
  people who do n't get accepted now hardly have a chance of `` duldung '' , which is no asylum status , but a permission to stay . 
  so no , she did n't invite anybody . 
  but i guess you can show me some statistics with nice colorful graphs that prove the massiv influx of immigrants after what merkel said . 
  thanks . 
  i tell you why people were chanting . 
  because we did n't close our borders like you did . 
  we cared about the people who walk for two months from syria to europe just to get a perspective in their life . 
  we did what was the right thing to do . 
  but you can go on and live in your bubble . 
  there is no upper limit for syrians . 
  and the ones who will not be accepted will be sent home . 
  but you are changing the topic . 
  people came anyways , despite the fact that they stranded in hungary . 
  they did n't care . 
  as a consequence ,  yes , none would come . 
  is factually wrong . 
  sure . 
  like nobody came before when they were treated like animals and criminals in hungary . 
  nobody came , they 're not retarded . 
  dude , some people in here are far from any knowledge or common sense . 
  but it 's allright , we 'll leave you alone . 
  stable economic growth and stable currency , good perspectives . 
  massive service and export sector , with exports to germany 19.3 % , italy 11.9 % , france with 6.8 % , hungary 5.1 % . 
  plus eu money . 
  sorry , but it is bullshit what you talk . 
   it 's time for us to work for ourselves and stop feeding germany 's trade surplus . 
  this is in the interest of the eu . 
  i wonder , however , how you want to achieve that without eu investments . 
  most likely not . 
  there are pages in arabic that promise migrants the paradise , once they arrive in germany or sweden . 
  i wonder who sets them up . 
  same goes for the traffickers . 
  of course , i mean , it 's part of their business model . 
   what do they see , what have they heard ? 
  after the statement of merkel , the number of refugees that leave the war areas has not increased . 
  this was my point . 
  exactly . 
  cohesion policies like solving european problems as a european union . 
  thanks for pointing this out . 
   stop acting as if germany owns the eu or eastern europe . 
  i do n't . 
   ... not a bribe for accepting migrants from the middle east . 
  you can call it as you want . 
  cohesion policies , bribe ... just as it suits your narrative . 
   * ... they have instead encouraged the flow of people . 
  * as i said many times in this sub , even in this thread , there is neither a single sentence nor a statistic that would back this assumption . 
  merkel said that syrians can stay . 
  and this was the correct decision . 
  she also said `` es kann nicht jeder bleiben '' , not everybody can stay . 
  do you remember [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/angela-merkel-comforts-teenage-palestinian-asylum-seeker-germany ) ? 
   i question the usefulness of that . 
  the usefulness here is to remind other members that they are in a union where they ca n't pick what they want and leave others with their problems . 
  problems that concern all of europe must be solved by all of europe . 
  and countries like slovakia , rumania , portugal , the czeck republic , lituania , slovenia , latvia and estonia are taking 0.2 % of the refugees . 
  after the k\u00f6nigssteiner key , which keeps economical and social aspects in mind , these countries together could take 9.5 % . 
  they contribute nothing . 
  it 's right there . 
  i did above . 
  oh i 'm excited for the explanation of the eu funds . 
  yes . 
  like the [ horrendous amounts of eu-money ] ( http://www.bpb.de/wissen/p16rql,0,top_5_nettozahler_und_nettoempf%e4nger_der_eu.html ) that eastern european countries receive . 
  and the fact that germany takes care of the refugees . 
  can you imagine what would have happened if the germans would n't have opened the borders ? 
  there would be a lot less problems in this country now . 
  and a lot more in eastern europe . 
   she unilaterally invited bullshit . 
  there is not one statistic or one sentence that proves this assumption . 
  what she said is : `` es k\u00f6nnen nicht alle kommen '' , `` not everybody can come '' . 
  what merkel did was helping hungary and eastern europe with its masses of immigrants . 
  what do you think would have happened if germany had closed its borders ? 
  hundreds of thousands of refugees in slovenia , croatia , slovakia , czech republic . 
  and we would n't have any problems . 
  eastern europe should be thankful that germany is willing to act . 
  all right . 
  then do n't count on any more help from us . 
  we will leave you alone . 
  edit : must be hard for you guys , no ? 
  all of a sudden , europe wants something back after it fed you for years . 
  must be hard when mama takes your toys away when you wo n't clean your room . 
  well , there is no other way than to grow up , i guess . 
  better now than later . 
  better accept some unpleasant truths . 
  was it , by chance , [ this ** nsfw ** ] ( https://news.artnet.com/wp-content/news-upload/2014/06/origin-world-nude-actual-art.jpg ) master piece of a `` close-up '' ? 
  :d good for france , though . 
  correct decision in my eyes . 
  dozens ?
