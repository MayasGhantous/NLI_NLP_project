  deport all of them , even those who did n't do * anything * wrong ? 
  thank god that people in europe have moral standards . 
  it would have been worse for all of europe if these people had stayed in hungary . 
  the eu 's main achievements , one market , freedom of travel and collaboration in security and foreign policy are beneficial for * every * citizen of the eu . 
  personally , i also support the integration of the eu countries . 
  that does not mean that the states should lose their sovereignty , but that decisions are made together . 
  and that people should appreciate how much europe as a whole has and had in common . 
  the outlines of the countries were extremely difficult for me . 
  i have n't had one correct . 
  can someone explain to me the benefits of giving key technologies to china ? 
  i just do n't understand it from the long term point of view : germany f. ex . 
  is now successful because it has engineering expertise and had it for decades . 
  now , if they sell these companies , they will allow china to gain this expertise and weaken the position of the german abilities and future developments . 
  so how does this make sense ? 
  damn . 
  exactly the same in germany . 
  in italy , it showed some success with the election of the five star movement . 
  in germany , we will see next year ... 
  but what about [ krampus ] ( https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2015/11/krampus-the-dark-companion-of-saint/k15_499101560/main_900.jpg?1448907996 ) and [ carneval ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/f/ff/fasching-maske-2.jpg ) ?? 
  or [ this ] ( http://cdn.scahw.com.au/cdn-1ce4577da5f5a70/imagevaultfiles/id_162081/cf_7/trending-scary-baby-masks3-628.jpg ) wonderful highlight of western culture ? 
  now that you mention it ... s. 30ff , page 30 and the following pages . 
  still less confusing than what the spanish do . 
  if the word is a plural , they double the letters . 
  usa = estados unidos = ee . 
  and so forth . 
  do n't trust reddit . 
  and your article quotes an expectation from the bulgarian prime minister . 
  it has always been around 50-50 . https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/, 
  thanks . 
  would n't have thought . 
  when and where exactly did you hear this , if i may ask ? 
  damn , britbongs need to get their facts straight in this thread . 
  can you link it ? 
  38 % in the second tour is still quite high if you ask me ... 
  what the fuck are you talking about !? 
  nobody is allowed to marry more than one person in germany and nobody is allowed to kill somebody . 
  at least in germany , christian religion is privileged by law ( taxes , in some federal states it 's the state religion ) . 
  this is not the kind of discussion i 'm taking part in . 
  your views are eather uninformed or brainwashed . 
  you have apparently no idea what is happening in europe . 
  i wish you all the best . 
   no but if you to their country you have to follow the laws and respect their culture . 
  exactly . 
  and everybody does in europe as well , because our culture is freedom and prosperity . 
  you believe in whatever god you want or do n't believe at all . 
  you wear whatever the fuck you want . 
  but you 'll follow the law and respect others . 
  that 's our culture , and it is demanded by every state i know to follow this . 
  in the end , this is what makes us different from states like saudi arabia . 
  it 's not that we eat rye bread and they eat hummus . 
  it is humanism . 
  and i tell you that as a catholic . 
  so you want to be like saudi arabia ? 
  well ... looks like europeans do n't . 
  yeah . 
  well done . 
  first mountain brothers , now swamp brothers . 
  ode to joy intensifies . 
  will the first predictions be made public at 21:00 ? 
  for me this just shocking to see . 
  it 's the netherlands , probably the nicest country on the planet and a huge investor for turkey . 
  erdogan is acting utterly retarded . 
  you have all my support . 
  yeah . 
  with a polish f\u00fchrer . 
  how times are changing . 
  if you think that china is a role model , you really should n't talk about delusion . 
  china is one of the most corrupt countries in the world . 
  your house is in the way of a new street ? 
  too bad , you get deported without any money . 
  you speak out against that ? 
  or criticize the government in any other form ? 
  too bad , the secret service will jail you without a trial . 
  your wife gets run over by the ferrari of a drunk son of a chinese billionaire ? 
  too bad , nothing will happen . 
  you want to follow christianity ? 
  too bad , your neighbours will report you and you 'll not be allowed to travel anymore . 
  you get sick after working in a chemical plant for 14 hours a day 7 days a week ? 
  too bad , you 're broke now . 
  it gets better , to be fair . 
  but it is n't yet . 
  it 's embarassing how your forefathers fougth and died for your freedom and you give it away just because of primitive nationalism . 
  if that drunken fool was by chance the leader of said country , that 's your problem . 
  concerning kosovo : crimea happened in two weeks without any independant court decision . 
  kosovo took years of discussion , diplomacy , international courts and not to forget a war . 
   and i see nothing wrong with that , considering the different option would plunge russia into chaos of the 90s . 
  that 's what all authoritarian leaders say . 
  `` you need me , or everything will get worse . '', 
  too bad russians are waking up . 
  they see that none of the promises about crimea happens . 
  corruption is as bad as always . 
  awesome coats . 
  would wear . 
  good . 
  i 'm happy that it is in european hands again . 
  makes the brand more buyable for me .

  ah , no no , that seems to be an important concept . 
  no , politicians ( better : the * whole parliament * ) can only withdraw immunity . 
  this means that a trial can take place .
