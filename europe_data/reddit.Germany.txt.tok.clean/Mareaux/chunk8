  it 's the only thing putin understands . 
  as i said . 
  `` keep colored people out of my country '' . 
  it 's no wonder that people call you a racist or in exaggerated terms a nazi . 
  that 's because `` preserving a part of white/european culture '' usually means `` keep coloured people out of the country '' . 
  but please , tell me , what parts of german culture you see in danger and what are your countermeasures ? 
   ... probably ...  it seems ...  ... 
  i think sorry , but you have no idea . 
  just let it be . 
   many outspoken germans believe that . 
  i told you before , you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  schools teach the opposite , the media as well and there are exhibitions about that topic . 
  there are probably more people who believe in a flat earth than in this . 
  does n't say that `` germans believe '' this . 
  because they do n't . 
   germans created and believe their clean wehrmacht myth . 
   facts . 
  probably you are appreciative of what the human rights charta has to offer . 
  like giving shelter to refugees and shit . 
  only from the washington post , which presumably is n't one of your favourite newspapers , according to your post history . 
  plus , it is wrong . 
  source : http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-10/angela-merkel-influence-refugees-open-borders-balkan-route furthermore , she does n't admit that it was wrong to let the refugees in - which already were in europe , by the way - , she admitted that certain things were handled wrong , in particular the fact that the controls were too sloppy . 
  she explicitly says that she would open the borders for refugees again . 
  this is also what your source says . 
  but apparently you have n't read that either . 
  you should read more than just the headline . 
  and it is sooooo fucking childish to block the people you know you do n't stand a chance against :d, 
  have you read it ? 
  apparently not . 
  because i ca n't read `` it 's merkel 's fault '' anywhere . 
  too bad she 'll get reelected . 
  which is good . 
  i agree with you . 
  quite the opposite , if you ask me . 
  scaring the bull with fire is far less cruel than [ this ] ( http://www.biokontakte.com/wp-content/gallery/mrsa-gefaehrliches-gefluegel/gal_huehnermast-10_dokumentiere_de.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://www.vgt.ch/vn/0901/ow9-kaegiswil-83.jpg ) . 
  and do n't get me wrong , i 'm not arguing in favour of all that spanish bull stuff . 
  i 'm arguing against the hypocrisy and the irrational hysteria of typical reddit threads about this topic . 
  sure . 
  but just read this thread . 
  `` fuck spain '' , `` pathetic and cruel '' , `` hope it gets destroyed by migrant culture '' ... 
  meanwhile , millions of chicken , pigs and cattle are held under despicable conditions just to make sure your steak does n't cost more then three euros and hunting as a sport is accepted everywhere . 
  not to forget foie gras . 
  no , it 's not , but it 's making this typical reddit drama hypocritical . 
  you are saying what i am saying . 
  they knew it . 
  they accepted it . 
  to believe that the allies would have accepted a nazi when there was an alternative is ridiculous . 
  this was in the middle of denazification . 
  globke was n't a war criminal and was n't charged in nuremberg . 
  that seemed to be enough . 
  no , but it supports my point . 
  ( and adenauer 's . ), 
  what 's there to believe ? 
  you have to accept this as a historical fact . 
  to think that adenauer was in any way connected to nazism is ridiculous . 
   you really think they could not find less tainted people in the whole of west germany ? 
  yes , i do believe that , especially , as i say now for the third time , because the allies agreed with it . 
  because it was the only thing he could do . 
  and the allies agreed . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  that 's a fair point . 
  but that does n't make adenauer a nazi sympathizer , which was the initial accusation . 
  do you want to tell me something in particular ? 
  apparently so , i just read that adenauer commented this with `` you do n't pour away dirty water as long as you do n't have clear water '' . 
  plus , despite adenauer was criticized for nominating globke , he received the bundesverdienstkreuz in 1963 , way after his nazi past was discussed publicly . 
  his wikipedia article is quite interesting . 
  the thing was that he did n't have enough people to run a government . 
  he had to fill positions with people who already had these positions during the third reich . 
  the allies agreed . 
  i am not aware of anyone who committed a crime , was a member of the ss etc. 
  or escaped punishment in any way . 
  this does n't make adenauer a nazi-sympathizer , i would say that he was quite the opposite , considering that the nazi administration fired him from previous government jobs and jailed him because he was n't complicit . 
  julius streicher , publisher of * der st\u00fcrmer * , was sentenced to death in nuremberg . 
  you could definately say that he weaponized speach . 
  or think about goebbels . 
  sorry man , but this is absolute bullshit . 
  first , it is definitely * not * censorship . 
  it 's two basic rights colluding , namely free speech and personality rights . 
  this might get handled differently in other countries , but there is no moral deficit , restriction of political discourse or suppression of government criticism when it 's a crime to say `` you are an asshole '' or `` gas the jews '' . 
  and this is what we are talking about . 
   this is why germany does not have a robust public debate on many issues bullshit again . 
  during the last year , there was nothing discussed more intensely than immigration , both intellectually , politically and privately . 
  can you name another topic ? 
  well , it 's clear where this law is coming from . 
  considering this , the `` fascism '' accusations are quite ridiculous . 
  do you have an example for when this was used in a `` censorship '' way ? 
  i have n't heard of any abuses of this law . 
  plus , it is quite well defined , when it gets used and when somebody gets sentenced . 
  yeah , just like poland did . 
  it wo n't be off-topic then either . 
  i just edited my comment . 
  i said that you can start in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hed45/president_of_the_european_council_donald_tusk/ ) . 
  i 'm looking forward to your comment . 
   i always admit we killed jews during the second world war , it happened and it 's a sad fact . 
  well good , i suppose you write that under every post about poland . 
  just in case some people from far away did n't know . 
  ( but watch out , you might get jailed for that . 
  edit : why not start right now in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hed45/president_of_the_european_council_donald_tusk/ ) ? 
  it even fits the topic . 
  i 'm looking forward to your comment .
