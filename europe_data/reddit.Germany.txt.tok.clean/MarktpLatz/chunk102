   `` directly to award ` goes to supply 112,370 rifles g36 , of 5.56 mm , the german company h & k , which will replace the classic greek army g3 . 
  under the interstate agreement , greece has committed to 30 years of monopoly supply . 
  the value of arms reaches 250 million . '', 
  this deal was sealed a few years ago , however it has been frozen ( due to the economic crisis ? ) . 
  i wonder how this affects the russian proposal . 
  this also was a deal that included co-manufacturing in greece btw . 
  ~ ~ replacing the g3 with the ak-12 would be abandoning nato standarts - the ak uses a non-nato-calibre . ~ ~ also , rifle manufacturing does not add ` lots of manufacturing jobs ' , unfortunately . 
  ( heckler & koch , being the 5th largest rifle manufacturer in the world employs barely 700 people ) . 
  this however would be violating eu law . 
  i think a fixed rate would be more fitting . 
  lets say you make every car-holder pay 100 $ for europa-wide toll per year . 
  all of that money goes into a central pool and is redistributed based on traffic volume . 
  the biggest users ( in terms of damaging the streets ) are the trucks anyways , and those already have to pay toll . 
  because the tax break is directly connected to the toll . 
  the first attempt of our government was to say `` every german gets it for free '' , but that is against eu treaties . 
  now they are trying to do the same by reducing the tax the same amount you payed for the toll - which violates the non-discrimination rule of the eu yet again . 
  they are free to issue whatever tax breaks they want , as long as it is not connected to the toll . 
  not even the csu thinks their voters are too stupid to understand what happened there ... 
  i do not think so . 
  yes , merkel gave in to the requests to a toll , however her condition was that no german pays more than before ( essentially rendering any proposal void since it would violate eu rights ) . 
  i know that her insurances are not always worth that much , however i can hardly see her revert her standing twice on the same topic against her promises . 
  without disrespect to the mentioned , the resistances were more of an annoyance , they would not have been able to win the war against the occupators . 
  that being said , they sure played their role , especially by binding forces to the occupied areas . 
  contributing the most does not equal ` winning the war alone ' . 
  what use will it have however ? 
  the thing that is actually damaging the roads the most are the trucks , which already have to pay toll . 
  if there will be income from the toll , you will see our government cut the government funding for infrastructure by pretty much that amount . 
  the fact that , unlike now , foreigners will pay for the streets as well is actually neglectable given how little income it would generate ( i think the last calculation was 200 million euros from foreigners - we spend more on a g7 meeting ) . 
  there is no sound economic reasoning for it . 
  it is just some false sense of ` equality ' forcing foreigners to pay because they do the same to us . 
  are n't the current plans stickers ? 
  i rather think the response ( from the bavarian csu , the only party in favor of the project ) will be : `` oh , dear voters , the evil eu killed our toll despite it being super fair . 
  bad eu ! '', 
  nobody won the war alone . 
  however , someone wrote a sentence that i found rather fitting - `` ww 2 was won with us equipment , british intelligence and russian blood '' . 
  nobody buys the ` new kmw ' . 
  nobody talks about the ` bae tank ' either . 
  this is why the name of the company does not matter . 
  kant = ** k ** mw ** a ** nd ** n ** exter ** t ** ogether, 
  sometimes the competitors get stuck in a situation where they bribe because the other ones bribe aswell . 
  so it somewhat becomes a self-fulfulling prophecy . 
  if none of the arms industries is bribing , the buyer has no other option than to decide on the most competetive product . 
  i know that this is idealized , but in the end it is how it should be ( and we had some initiatives from transparency int . 
  where competitors for markets in some african countries were stuck in exactly that situation and brining them together , ensuring them that no one would bribe solved some of the problems ) . 
  it 's also a shame that some people think bribing is a good way to get a deal . 
  complete equality will never be achieved . 
  not even in a federalized eu . 
  the most prominent example currently would be voting rights i guess . 
  however , generally equality of eu citizens is a good idea and we should try not to limit it any further . 
  i have no problem with that statement . 
  however , i do not think that we could just cut the ties and be fine , given the german/eastern european reliance on russian gas . 
  with a few years preparation , it is possible , doing it immediately would do a lot of harm for our side . 
  however especially when it comes to germany , the reliance on russia is way higher than the eu average . 
  uk amongst others really drives this number down . 
  work benefits are not about freedom of movement but equality of eu citizens . 
  also , if it is a principle written down in the treaties , there is not much that cameron will accomplish against the will of poland . 
  / r/france is french speaking however . 
  op obviously does not speak french and we have a lot of english-speaking french redditors here . 
  so i think it is somewhat the right place . 
  what makes you think that there are only african people coming to the eu ? 
  in fact , people with african origin have been a minority in the last years . 
  [ in 2013 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/docs/infographics/asylum/infographic_asylum_en.pdf ) , we had three african countries in the ` top 10 ' of origin countries - somalia , eritrea and nigeria . 
  [ sources for 2015 ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/154287/umfrage/hauptherkunftslaender-von-asylbewerbern/ ) ( however just germany and just until april ) indicate that these numbers pretty much stayed the same ( the russian asylum seekers tend to stay in the eastern european countries ) . 
  well the german mp did care . 
  while i do not agree with russia , you have to be some special kind of oblivious to think that russia would not issue a response for ` our ' blacklisting of people . 
  big countries are capped , but only germany is affected . 
  we used to have 99 seats , now down to 96 . 
  however , its fine . 
  yes , they voted against equality , however not because they are against it but because it was one of the tradeoffs they had to make entering the coalition with the cdu . 
  it is pretty ironic that , at that point , their previous party leader and back-then german foreign minister , westerwelle , is gay . 
  there might be a growing number of eurosceptics , but they have no platform currently . 
  the afd somewhat fulfilled that role over the last year , however the afd drifted more and more to the right , serving xenophobic sentiments . 
  there is a inner-party clash going on and if it continues the way it is , we might see their party leader ( and founder ) leave the party with the moderate part of the party . 
  the cdu in total is too eurofriendly to prompt a change in merkels politics , the other major parties are also euro-friendly ( the * linke * is critical about the eu , however not about the eu per se , more about the direction of politics in the eu ) . 
  considering marriage equality , the cdu has always been behind in time . 
  i however expect our constitutional court to force them to equalize gay marriage within the next 2-3 years . 
  i 'd say a return of the fdp is likely , but the fdp is no ` left ' party . 
  the spd is having trouble to sell successes as their own , i do not see the afd break the 5 % on a national level , especially given their current innter-party clashes . 
  hell , we might even see the afd break up before the next election . 
  your local politicians are likely not knowing more than you do . 
  of course , we have a lot of parties and politicians opposing it , but this is also due to public opinion , which is strongly disagreeing without having ever seen a single line of the agreement . 
  and if you are looking at the parties in power - no major party that is in power has called for a complete stop of the negotiations , they drew some red lines , which is totally fine , but only opposition parties and ngos are completely opposing any kind of agreement . 
  what benefits the ` big business ' is not necessarily to your disadvantage . 
  consumer organizations are never in favor of agreements that are not primarily focussed on improving consumer rights . 
  i can completely understand that these organizations are seeing the threat of lower rights and protection for the consumer , however they do not know what will be part of the agreement either . 
  no , we do not know , even remotely , what the final paper will contain . 
  most stuff that has been published so far have been excerpts of negotiating positions , which has lead to a highly polarized discussion towards ttip . 
  this headline is so wrong . 
  it is not possible to approve the agreement until it is published . 
  also , the means of the negotiations is to overcome disagreements , finding a solution that both sides can live with . 
  he is just trying to improve the negotiating position of the uk . 
  limitation of freedom of movement and similar things wo n't happen as it would require treaty changes . 
  this guy does not even hold the power to threaten with a brexit , it is up to the voters to decide , not up to him . 
  for the referendum , he will have one vote , like any other british voter . 
  honestly the president of the ecb holds more power just given the current situation and he is playing a way more active role . 
  yes , the economy of the world is highly dependend on the fed , however yellen is still reliant on the board of governors plus the fed decided to play a relatively passive role at the moment . 
   and do n't forget that eu companies also need to comply with us standards too in some industries . 
  this eu vs. 
  us standarts is nonsense , we need to get the best from both worlds . 
   also , pretty sure that the us does n't need the eu more than the eu needs the us ... last i checked the eu does n't actively help protect the american continent .
