  i am no expert on the shipping industry , but i doubt the reason for the mentioned transaction is that the situation in greece is so prosperous but rather connected to tax benefits . 
  direct democracy would be a great model - given the ideal that everyone who is voting is completetly educated on the issue . 
  unfortunately that is an utopia . 
  in reality the majority of the people voting will only have a basic understanding of the topic , if any . 
  take for example the swiss referendum on buying new jets for their air force . 
  i simply do not trust the masses to make a ` good ' decision on sensible topics like defense . 
  their opinion will be heavily influenced by expensive campaigns , i dont want to say that everyone follows the reigning opinion like a sheep , still he or she will be influenced by it . 
  the next problem with direct democracy is the fact that the question that is asked in the referendum heavily influences the outcome of it . 
  it is way easier for people to vote no than to vote yes . 
  the reason is simple - they can be faithful to themselves if they vote no but they will have to compromise on their opinion if they vote yes as a proposal never fits ones opinion 100 % . 
  furthermore , direct democracy really benefits the reigning party , making changing the government much tougher for the parties in the opposition . 
  the reason for that is that , if the opposition makes good use of the tool of referendums , they remove any distinction points between the party as every policy that actually has the support of the majority of the voters will be implemented through referendums . 
  while this is not a bad thing per se , it makes direct democracy incompatible with most kinds of representation . 
  in addition , there are a lot of opinions that might be popular in the majority of countries but are rightfully not being implemented by the parliaments . 
  direct democracy strengthens nationalism , protectionism and selfishness . 
  whatever one thinks of the eu , whether one sees it as a bureaucratic monster without proper legitimation or whatever , it is a construct that has brought us seven consecutive decades of peace , a project that would not have have stood any realistic chance in a public referendum . 
  i still think that it is a great tool on a smaller scale , as long as it does not influence the budget right of the parliament or adresses too complex decisions . 
  switzerland might be the world 's happiest country , but that does not make it the most well-governed country . 
  iirc the us were ranked higher than most european countries in that statistic , still nobody would say that the political/governing system of the us is any good in its current state . 
  it is overly simplified and thus does fall short of the reality . 
  i did not call it antisemitic because it is direct hatred against jews but because shortening/simplifying it as far as op did evokes the feeling of it being antisemitic . 
  why would you call it post ww2 when half of it is pre - and during wartime ? 
  also , it is pretty antisemitic and not true . 
  wow . 
  super credible sources . 
  totally proves your point that we are all brainwashed and that we are all defeated by islamism . 
  i dont know where you are from , but you certainly have no idea what is going on here . 
  hint : it is pretty decent , even in the proclaimed `` no-go zones '' . 
  oh , maybe the reality is just censored from us , is that what it is ? 
  censored right in front of our faces . 
  well , then we are at the spending level of mare nostrum again ( not saying that it is a bad thing ) . 
  b-b-but it says expert !, 
  the tinfoil hat is glowing !, 
  depends on the kind of school ( we have three branches from grade 5 ) and what grade you are talking about . 
  i am talking about the `` gymnasium '' here , the highest of the three branches . 
  in the lower grades , you get exactly this stuff like grammar , syntax etc. 
  the last three years were basically the work with written books - interpretation , historical classification , focussing on certain specifics of a period ( both concerning the literature aswell as the `` real world '' during that time ) books we read ( this is not a complete list , i am missing out on some , i linked to english wikipedia ) : * [ fr\u00e4ulein else ] ( http://goo.gl/ih1zcq ) - a novella by arthur schnitzler * [ the sandman ] ( http://goo.gl/zoua8y ) - short story by e.t.a. 
  hoffmann * [ the reader ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_reader ) - novel by bernard schlink , post-war literature * [ the physicists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_physicists ) - a satirical drama for theatre by friedrich d\u00fcrrenmatt * [ the metamorphosis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_metamorphosis ) - novella by franz kafka * [ woyzeck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woyzeck ) - stage play by georg b\u00fcchner we also did some of the same stuff in english class with [ black like me ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_like_me ) , [ slumdog millionaire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slumdog_millionaire ) and [ shakespeare 's romeo and juliet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romeo_and_juliet ) . 
  considering the application for the university : i am studying law and all i had to submit was my high school graduation certificate and my personal information . 
  it depends on the university and field of study what you have to submit , the most `` common '' way is to restrict the application to a certain average grade on your graduation . 
  there are some private universities ( not a lot though ) which have application tests you have to take . 
  the rest does not make much more sense either . 
  its a bit short isnt it ? 
  you dont really answer the question your headline poses and you dont go into much detail . 
  essentially you are just saying that a government decision on what to do with the influx of money after the euro introduction fucked up whole greece , which is not true . 
   all of europe has a responsibility to stop people from drowning . 
  it 's partly due to their actions in africa that people have had to leave their homes . 
  italy is doing so much to help save refugees and it needs support . 
  countries such as britain , france , belgium and germany think they are far away and not responsible , but they all took part in colonising africa . 
  nato took part in the war in libya . 
  they 're all part of the problem . 
  how are the current problems the fault of the nato or the mentioned countries ? 
  yes , we colonized africa and yes , we took part in libya , we also supported many autocrats for a long time . 
  however , what is the way out of this - if we continue supporting the said autocrats , we are bad , if we support people overthrowing the government , we are too . 
  but in the end , the arabic spring was not initiated by the mentioned countries , they only supported certain movements . 
   i 've been lucky . 
  in berlin , i met my girlfriend and we now have a baby boy . 
  unfortunately we do not know how this guy is doing currently , but he seems just like the perfect example of a refugee that serves as a negative example for the populistic right-wing parties . 
  unemployed , violates eu law , fathers a daughter and collects benefits from the government . 
  i wonder from what year that data is . 
  the us wasnt # 1 passport in any of the statistics i have seen for the previous years . 
  however , this might be due to a limitation to `` visa-free access '' , not including countries where you get a visa on arrival .

  in addition : please dont paint countries without data black , it almost looks like these people never move out . 
  troll post 7/10 . 
  you could argue that it is true for both of them . 
  i think its alright . 
  it will be five years to a decade until these ships enter service . 
  what i am a bit sceptical about is the prospect of exporting the technology . 
  the last successful export of ships built for the italian navy was the classe lupo in the 70s and 80s , the more recent ships did not find much success here . 
  he just did it all wrong . 
  in kassel , germany , they [ built a transformer out of former chinese army trucks ] ( http://www.geo.de/reisen/community/bild/regular/532637/transformer-von-bi-heng.jpg ) , and it was art . 
  what actually bothers me the most is that it `` only '' costs 22 million euros . 
  that is like ... nothing . 
  why would they reduce their number of mbts by a third but keep the troops that formerly operated them ? 
  especially considering the troops being the most expensive part about it . 
  of course , operating tanks is also not cheap , but certainly much cheaper than e.g. 
  a jet . 
  i 'd argue that it evens out . 
  the dutch capabilities on sea extend what can be expected from a country of their size ( it makes more sense if you see the historical background , but still ) , and they are buffered by the largest naval force on seaside ( britain ) and the two most populated european countries to the landside . 
  while they might have the biggest tank army in europe , they only have around 350 leopard 2s , they have a huge number of older leopard 1 and american tanks though . 
  arent p-99s suited for a different role ? 
  the us are replacing their p3s with p-8 aircrafts which are a little more expensive ( australia is paying 3.8 billion for 8 of them ) . 
  germany plans to use its p-3s ( c version though ) until 2035 . 
  iirc pasok did exactly this after they took office in 2009 . 
   that doesnt seem very democratic . 
  and it isnt . 
  because what was stated previously is not entirely true . 
  acting against the constitution or just speaking out against it does not justify the ban of a party , the party would have to act against the constitution and pose a serious threat to the free democratic fundamentals of the state by doing so . 
  actually i think it was more of a pun directed at the greek parliament completely rebuying the governmental car pool because new cars are `` cheaper to operate '' . 
  i never claimed that germans are the best drivers and that stuff like this does not happen here . 
  actually , the autobahn is perfectly designed for being cut off etc. 
  since there is no speed range that most cars fit in . 
  traffic is a lot less abrupt when everyone is driving between 100 and 120 km/h compared to a scenario where like 50 % go 130 and 20 % go over 180 . 
  ( and yes , i made up these numbers ) however , the whole point of my statement was that i have experienced worse things in other countries and that i dont find `` most aggressive '' fitting for that reason . 
  it is completely subjective of course and i might also be a bit biased . 
  however , i think the definition of `` aggressive '' in the perception of the drivers of one country may vary . 
  well , that does not really fit my experience but whatever . 
   the man added that he once lived in east germany , where he had seen how rapidly the slide can occur , once citizens lack weapons .
