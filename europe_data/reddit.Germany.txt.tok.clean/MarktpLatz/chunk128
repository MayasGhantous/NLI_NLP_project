   but stop spewing your opinions if you do n't have arguments to back them up . 
  i do have sources backing up everything i said . 
  however parent did not use sources either , so why should i bother to provide sourcens where he does n't . 
   it is not . 
  let 's have a look what parent originally stated : `` us and canadian companies will be able to sue european states if they believe european laws and regulations have harmed their investments . '', 
  this is neither backed by the countless isds cases i have studied nor is it backed by the isds provision given in [ ceta ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf ) . 
  ceta explicitly states that a simple loss of profit does not qualify for compensation . 
   not decided yet . 
  [ listed as pending ] ( http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/isds/details/458 )  no plain packaging case has been successful so far . 
  [ australia ` won ' since isds court says it does not have jurisdiction ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/australia-wins-international-legal-battle-with-philip-morris-over-plain-packaging ) . 
  all other plain packaging cases are not decided yet . 
   which is a very small amount of money . 
  that 's less than 150 millions per year . 
  that 's peanuts . 
  simple math . 
   no , products meeting low regulation standards will not necessarily be admitted here . 
  [ eu factsheet on food regulation ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/january/tradoc_153004.3%20food%20safety,%20a+p%20health%20 ( sps ) . pdf ) statement from the eu : `` us exports of agricultural commodities to the eu are vital as animal feed and ingredients in the food industry . 
  we are aware that competition from us products as a result of full liberalisation of eu-us trade could adversely affect some eu agricultural products . 
  in these cases , instead of full liberalisation we would negotiate import quotas , as we have in other eu free trade agreements . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/about-ttip/questions-and-answers/ )  the eu . 
  statement from the eu commissioner for agriculture and rural development given on february 9th 2015 : `` let me be clear -- there will be no hormone beef or chlorinated chicken entering the eu market as a result of any ttip deal . '', 
   trade negotiations have always been conducted in secret . 
  common knowledge . 
  trade deals have always been negotiated by experts . 
  the parliaments usually do not have a say in this until the agreement is finished . 
  ( they will give their expectations which the experts will incooperate , just like in this deal ) . 
   neither do various other countries we have trade agreements with . 
  does not need sourcing . 
   this is not clear . 
  there are countless studies that show a net positive impact on the european employment numbers . 
  use google for this one . 
  [ i will link you the independent study the eu links however ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150737.pdf ) . 
   the effect of that will depend on how it is done . 
  regulatory cooperation is a very complicated issue that can not be fit into a short statement . 
  as i said , it all depends on what ends up being negotiated . 
   always happy to hear germans pushing for less democracy . 
  what happened last when only 40 % of people where in favor of something ? 
  i feel completely confident disregarding the public opinion on this issue . 
  simply because 95 % of the population does not understand shit about this topic . 
   well the thing is ... it has to be unanimous . 
  sucks does n't it ? 
  do n't be so smug . 
  you claimed to speak for `` all europeans '' and you are not . 
  so what . 
   yeah you 're right . 
  pretty much every country is in favor . 
  you know who 's the most against : there wo n't be a public vote on the issue . 
  contrary to france , our politicians are in favor of it . 
   your point being ? 
  that claiming that ` we all ' are happy is inaccurate . 
  pretty much every other country in europe is in favor of more free trade . 
   if you do n't like it , start your own union buddy . 
  it seems like all other states in that union are in favor of it , your point being ? 
   we 're all happy with the status quo . 
  we are not . 
  france is pretty much the most protectionist country in europe . 
   if it was harmless , it 'd be public . 
  nope . 
  because every single trade deal so far has been conducted in secret . 
  not even talking about the other stuff you claim , because it lacks any rational basis . 
   it didnt , the loss of jobs are in the millions . 
  depends on the way of measurement . 
  there are no definite indicators that it actually led to job loss . 
  other studies say it did n't . 
   sorry , but is effectively how isds works it is not . 
   see veolia suing egypt for 82 million dollars because egypt raised its minimum wage . 
  not decided yet . 
   also see new zealand suspending its policy on neutral cigarette packaging because of the isds suit between philip morris and australia . 
  no plain packaging case has been successful so far . 
   canada also suspended this after an american tobacco company threatened with an isds suit . 
  source ? 
   since 1994 , european countries have had to pay at least 1.3 billion euros in compensation in isds suits ( 3 billion if you count settlements ) . 
  and that 's a conservative figure . 
  which is a very small amount of money . 
  that 's less than 150 millions per year . 
  that 's peanuts . 
   isds is a direct attack on national sovereignty for corporations . 
  not the case . 
   of course , german politicians have been saying that there wo n't be anything like that in ttip/ceta , even though there will be isds . 
  well , we wo n't really know , will we , since negotiations are all secret . 
  i do not have a problem with isds . 
   erm , products having to meet low regulatory standards are n't cheaper than those having to meet higher standards ? 
  no , products meeting low regulation standards will not necessarily be admitted here . 
   says who exactly ? 
  the eu . 
   chlorine chicken is fine ? 
  yes , that 's what bfr ( german risk institute ) says . 
  the same bfr that never publishes the names of the experts who work on their reports ( bfr also said that monsanto 's roundup herbicide has no cancer risks , despite a who study claiming the opposite ) . 
  this is actually not only a bfr opinion . 
   again , secret negotiations means no accountability . 
  trade negotiations have always been conducted in secret . 
   the usa does n't recognise the same rights to workers as europe does . 
  not even the basic ones stated in the european social charter . 
  neither do various other countries we have trade agreements with . 
   also , such tough competition will lead to massive job losses . 
  this is not clear . 
   also , you have n't said anything about `` regulatory cooperation '' . 
  the effect of that will depend on how it is done . 
   us and canadian companies will be able to sue european states if they believe european laws and regulations have harmed their investments . 
  inaccurate .
