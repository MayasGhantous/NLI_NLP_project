   international trade would n't suddenly go away . 
  with a currency twice the value - of course it would . 
   the mark would probably be a strong currency , but devaluating is comparable easy . 
  just print more of it . 
  this is not how we do things in germany . 
  this is never going to happen . 
  we are not going to print our way out of a crisis . 
  i think `` a mit affenschwanz '' ( a with an ape 's tail ) is the only thing i have ever heared , but only when i was a child . 
  nowadays , it has fallen out of favour . 
  i have actually never heared anything other than `` at '' . 
  and i have lived in multiple parts of germany , both north and south . 
  well , in most of the places i have been , there simply was n't the space for giant four-lane highways . 
  it also would not make any sense given that many of your roads only have very light traffic . 
   that the fn and the afd may finally have a shot at governing the afd has not a single shot at governing . 
  every other party is refusing to work with them and they have no realistic prospects of getting a majority . 
   renting is considerably more expensive . 
  true . 
  but i do n't think that the people working minimum wage in other countries can afford their own home either . 
  so it balances out . 
   seehofer has taken the initiative of increasing the pension level . 
  let 's hope for the best . 
  so has the spd . 
  well , we will see . 
   grabs popcorn well , i have a hard time imagining that it will do nothing to limit the disparity ( or at least slow the growth ) . 
  well , you have other treats . 
  you also have the burden of an incredibly large country with very few people ( in terms of infrastructure ) . 
  even we do have troubles maintaining these roads . 
  i had to take one route that actually had 90 km/h . 
  no shit . 
  felt like flying ^ ^ / s, 
  i have driven on them . 
  i have seen streets worse than yours however . 
  i was more annoyed at the constant toll payments honestly . 
  and the speed limits . 
  if you are used to driving at least 140-150 km/h , driving in norway feels like you are n't really moving . 
  on the plus side , the fuel economy was amazing . 
  managed to get over 1100 km with one fill instead of ~ 800 over here . 
  true . 
  but at least in this specific case , this would not be a problem as the way towards this utopia is described as peaceful and civilized . 
   i should be planning a bachelorette party right now , so only a few comments : law paper here , so we are fine i guess   purchase power : http://www.stone-ideas.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dtkaufkraft15-21.jpg big mac index : http://de.statista.com/graphic/1/199335/big-mac-index--weltweiter-preis-fuer-einen-big-mac.jpg keep the german purchase power in mind and now consider this fact ( ~ 50 % of germans live in rented accommodation ) [ minimum wages in ppp ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/c/cc/minimum_wages%2c_january_2016_%28%c2%b9%29_%28pps_per_month%29_yb16-ii.png/777px-minimum_wages%2c_january_2016_%28%c2%b9%29_%28pps_per_month%29_yb16-ii.png ) . 
  yes , many germans live in rented accommodation , but owning is not without cost either . 
   exactly , deutschlandrente could be a solution . 
  i 'll leave this up to the experts . 
  however it is clear that we do need to change things up . 
   this is wrong and you should feel bad for believing it : i stand corrected . 
  at least partially . 
  there is no data from 2014 or newer available yet . 
  let 's see how the minimum wage and the general wage increases affect things . 
  not exactly surprising given that the risk of crashing with someone else is pretty much non-existent on 90 % of your roads - there simply is n't anybody else . 
  plus you have a speed limit that is ... a bit low . 
  this is very much the view of everyone in the eu , including the dutch government . 
  well , a good utopia has never harmed someone , has it ? 
   so we have enough manpower to properly secure all bases . 
  we have outsourced that for some reason . 
  and it doesnt really work well . 
  this is actually inaccurate . 
  we had 60k asylum applications in march , not 20k . 
  we had 20,000 new asylum seekers in march . 
  this means that the actual influx was 20k , but we are still processing people that came here in 2015 due to a lack of resources . 
  this is good however . 
  it means that the number of non-processed asylum seekers is decreasing significantly . 
  -- -- -- we are currently experiencing an influx below 200 people per day , which would result in ~ 6000 applications per month . 
  which would be absolutely tolerable . 
  english clothing : french, 
  well , we are already everyones scapegoat . 
  bring it on !, 
  the issue i have with describing this as a pull factor is the following : being able to make the passage via turkey-greece itself is meaningless . 
  because it is only the route that goes here . 
  should germany and austria close their borders , there would only less desirable countries available for the flow . 
  however , the passage is still open . 
  this is why i do n't see it as a direct pull factor . 
  a pull factor is the generous policing in germany . 
  a pull factor can be family reunion . 
  a pull factor can be our prosperity and our generous welfare payments . 
  so the free passage is not a pull factor in itself but a factor that enables other pull factors . 
  this is what i mean . 
   and you see no problems with someone in government deciding what is considered `` hate speech '' and what is n't ? 
  this is not up to the government however . 
  the judiciary is independent and they are doign a pretty terrific job in this area . 
  discourse critical of the government is not silenced or hindered in any way . 
   the only solution is to make all speech free that 's the us solution and it prompts a lot of other issues . 
  pretty much every country in the world but the us puts limits on free speech . 
  and for good reasons . 
  we simply do not consider hate speech worthy of protection . 
   look , i understand why germans are wary of unlimited free speech because of your past . 
  that 's actually not the issue . 
  we are n't having these laws because of the ` damage free speech has done in the past ' . 
  it is simply a reaction to historical events , not in particular to free speech . 
  i can think of no good reason why holocaust denial should be legal . 
  the holocaust goes to the very core of our identity and we have tasked ourselves to keep reminding the world so that something like this ca n't ever happen again . 
  there are holocaust survivers in the us that are afraid that , once they have died , there will be no limits to relativisation of the things that happened . 
  this wo n't happen over here . 
  which is a good thing . 
   however , by censoring `` hate '' speech , you eliminate the ability to confront and challenge it . 
  there seriously is no way to have a discourse with the people that are sentenced . 
  the statements however are confronted . 
  because there is a public discourse * about * these statements . 
   you do n't get rid of the feelings behind the speech by censoring it - you allow the hatred to thrive and grow in the shadows . 
  i have a good counterargument : we are not having problems of this kind really . 
  what is a big issue ?
