  i would argue that germany * became * stable because of the system . 
  i am undecided on whether it is still needed . 
  i disagree with the assumption that `` parties dont form because of the hurdle '' . 
  [ look at the list of parties that took part in our last federal election ] ( https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/bundestagswahlen/btw_bund_13/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/index.html ) ( this list does not even include every party , it does not mention parties with less than 290 votes ) . 
  in the last five years , we had two more or less successful creations of new parties - the pirates ( they actually managed to get into some state parliaments ) and the afd ( as we all know ) . 
  the only argument that could be made is that people would actually vote different . 
  and that is actually totally legitimate , letting people vote by their beliefs ( without having to focus on the bigger parties ) . 
  we have seen how it went in the last eu election , i think it could serve as a good indicator that we wo n't run into weimar 2.0 if we abolished the threshold . 
  the biggest problem that i could see arising is that a very minor party ( with one or two mps ) could punch * significantly * over weight . 
  which would be injustified . 
   did new zealand do that ? 
  yes . 
  they switched from fptp to mmp which is somewhat similar to the german system . 
  it appears that they do not have a threshold . 
  however only 4 of their 121 seats are held by parties who reached less than 5 % . 
   if you want a good argument against that , just point out that pr and strong government are n't mutually exclusive . 
  you can easily fix the problem of instability ( such as seen in brazil , israel and the german weimar republic of 1920s ) by creating a minimum threshold . 
  for instance , in germany today there is a 5 % threshold . 
  that means that a party must get at least 5 % of the vote nationally to get any seats in parliament . 
  and look how strong germany is !, 
  they 're the powerhouse of the eu and their chancellor is the most powerful women in the world . 
  actually it is questionable whether we actually need a treshold at this point in time . 
  germany ( as well as the uk ) is a mature democracy . 
  we did not have a treshold in the last eu election and it resulted in 7 seats ( out of 95 ) going to parties that are not ` mainstream ' . 
  it still threatens stability a little bit ( since forming coalitions becomes harder ) , but i think we are at a point where we could take that . 
  i do n't have a problem with the current hurdle however . 
   if you are willing to not support democracy simply because you dislike what the public would choose , then you 're no better than a king in an ivory tower , believing they know best . 
  i actually have exactly this stance on direct democracy . 
  still better than advocating for an ` unfair ' parliamentary democracy i guess ? 
  true . 
  i severely dislike ukip but i think it is a shame that a party with 10 % of the votes gets one single seat in westminster . 
  interesting . 
  its exactly the same in germany . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  well , lets hope so . 
  and the uk ? 
  jewish physics ? 
  well , not exactly . 
  usually they have somewhat fixed seats ( the party leadership sitting in front ) , but if the attendance is shitty ( it sometimes actually happens that only one member of a party is present at some point in time ) you will see lower-rank parliamentarians sitting in the front . 
   the snp are okay with it . 
  firstly , it 's how scottish parliament works . 
  secondly , they helped deliver a petition for pr to downing street a few days after last years election . 
  that is impressive since it would greatly diminish their power on the uk level . 
  granted they have no feasible option of a government participation currently , but still . 
  respectable behaviour . 
   labour have no excuse for supporting fptp other than it gives them an advantage . 
  true . 
  had to look it up myself . 
  did n't know that either , so i have to thank you . 
  your german did not let you down . 
  the bench to the right actually belongs to the federal council . 
  this is not where the bundesrat works though . 
  the bundesrat has its own [ beautiful building ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/bundesrat-a.jpg/1280px-bundesrat-a.jpg ) . 
  in there , you will find the same thing the other way around : [ the federal government has seats in the bundesrat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/bundesrat_%28deutschland%29_plenarsaal.jpg/1280px-bundesrat_%28deutschland%29_plenarsaal.jpg ) . 
  this is caused by a few things : sometimes , it is necessary that the members of the federal government give a speech on an issue , they also have the right to watch any bundesrat session and they can be summoned to the bundesrat . 
  it is pretty much the same in the bundestag , just the other way around . 
   the snp are definitely okay with it . 
  they 're vocally pushing for pr and have been doing both before their landslide westminster victory and afterwards . 
  that is ... impressive . 
   that leaves only the ruling conservatives , with 37 % of the vote who oppose it with 50 % of the seats however ? 
  or will it be a public vote ? 
  i see these name signs - do the mps have fixed seats or do they just put their name sign wherever they want to sit ? 
  i should have gone by `` parliaments of the eu member states '' at a second though , agreed . 
  well , `` gaining traction '' would be a tad optimistic i 'd say . 
  i seriously can not see it happening . 
  i especially ca n't see the snp giving up their influence in westminster . 
  and that really is a shame . 
  as much as i dislike ukip , they deserve more than a single seat after reaching 10 % . 
  actually not a single verse of the full `` song of the germans '' mentions war . 
  we did not have an official hymn prior to the `` song of the germans '' being selected in the weimar republic . 
  the closest would be `` heil dir im siegerkranz '' , the hymn of the * kaiser * , and that has arguably been a bit more war-oriented . 
  yes . 
  well , since they are sitting in the last row already , there would be no problems with blocking the sight for people sitting behind them . 
  will you , though ? 
  we could probably include that one after a brexit :p, 
  we also need it more than others due to our voting system . 
  our voting system ensures that the number of mps will vary pretty much every election . 
  it would if the person speaking would not turn [ their back to a third of the parliament ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tnkvgdo.jpg ) ( disclaimer : i know that there is only a quarter directly behind her , but i also included some people from the sides ) . 
  or is it the government that is sitting behind her ? 
  i would argue that it 's actually very german . 
  form follows function and it is very practical . 
   the lines in the middle of the seats definitively do n't represents the party 's groups , considering france 's assembly shown here . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  they ( somewhat ) do in germany . 
  the reichstag can easily be modified , seats are relocated after every election . 
  when we elect our president ( which is also done in the reichstag ) , [ we fit 1200 people ] ( http://www.mitmischen.de/fotos/diskutieren/fotos_nachrichten/bundesversammlung/bundesversammlung.jpg ) into a building designed for 600 people , installing additional chairs and placing people in the spectator area . 
  the picture displays eight different groups of seats for the bundestag , which is not the number of groups but the actual number of somewhat separated areas . 
  [ here is an example of how it looks ] ( http://marko-muehlstein.de/pics/mms_sitzverteilung_kl.jpg ) after an election . 
  you see that some parties have multiple areas due to their sheer size ( it is very inconvenient if you have to pass 15 people to reach your seat ) but no party sits in the same bloc as another party . 
   no one will take action unless there is a dire , imminent catastrophe . 
  which is pretty much the eu in a nutshell . 
  at least concerning the most important topics . 
  ye , unfortunately i did not find a newer version . 
  well , not surprising since they change the positions of the seats after every election to match the parliamentary groups . 
  we are not voting symmetrically , that 's the problem .

   i 've not studied scottish law , but i have often worked on transactions in which there is a specific scottish law element , generally as part of a wider international transaction . 
  for example , sometimes there are scottish companies that are parties to a transaction or security is being taken over assets located within scotland and then specific scottish law advice is required .
