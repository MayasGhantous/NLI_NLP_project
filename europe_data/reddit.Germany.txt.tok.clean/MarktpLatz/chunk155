  yes , frances unions create problems . 
  yes , germany is significantly stronger than france . 
  but no , blaming all of it on the economic union is pretty weak . 
   either france can leave the eurozone , or germany can choose between raising its domestic demand drastically or abandoning the euro , so its real exchange rate can appreciate and leave others more breathing room . 
  germany does not have to choose anything . 
  we are already increasing domestic demand ( highest wage & pension raises in decades ) , but because it is the right thing to do and not because others demand that we do so . 
  we wo n't leave the euro zone , we are not stupid . 
  sorry , but `` breathing room '' for france does not help us anything if our economcy collapses . 
  if someone wants to leave because they think they can do better out of the euro zone , fine , but dont demand us to leave . 
  funfact : france forced germany to enter the euro , hoping to be able to limit our comparative economic power . 
  did not work out that well for them . 
  it would be pretty ridiculous to expect germany to do after frances liking every time they ask us to . 
   labor market reforms have very little to do with any of this . 
  actually they do . 
  france has problems employing people , the lack of flexibility in the labour market plays a significant role in this . 
  internal devaluation increases competitiveness . 
   something like 0.0026 i think ? 
  accurate . 
  but the article did not talk about it being one in total . 
  i simply used it as an example that there are in fact people coming from poland . 
  it might well be a few more , but this still means that the number per million inhabitants is below 0.1 which is very decent . 
  if it comes to fighters per million muslims however , you are around 33 ( assuming one fighter and 30k muslims ) which puts you at the level of albania , slightly below italy . 
  the number of muslims however is so low that this statistic does not exactly mean much . 
  a single person makes a difference of 33 in this context . 
  if you had five people , it would be comparable to germany . 
  [ not exactly ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/1.686205 ) . 
  it is widely known that they payed well . 
  they had to cut the pay significantly recently though - their income through oil and taxes was diminished greatly and they supposedly lost a lot of money when the us targeted their money storages . 
  [ adjusted to millions of muslim inhabitants , i would not say so ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4c9lrb/foreign_fighters_from_europe_to_isis/d1gb4ze ) . 
  / u/svorky already [ did this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4c9lrb/foreign_fighters_from_europe_to_isis/d1gb4ze ) . 
  i do n't , but / u/svorky was so nice and [ created it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4c9lrb/foreign_fighters_from_europe_to_isis/d1gb4ze ) . 
  it 's a schengen border in the sense of entering the schengen area by crossing that border . 
  per million inhabitants : 1 . 
  bosnia : 86.18 3 . 
  macedonia : 69.29 4 . 
  montenegro : 48.28 5 .

  not until they get the mess in their own country sorted out . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  this is not about libya - lampedusa . 
   the fiscal 2017 budget requests $ 1.8 billion to buy 45,000 smart bombs and other guided munitions to replenish supplies in the continuing air campaign against islamic state militants . 
  this is twice the amount syria spends on its military in total ( at least in pre-war times ) . 
   so ... ~ 350 000 at the height of the war , went down to ~ 30 000 who stayed ? 
  pretty much . 
   well done germans , i guess ? 
  we payed the people money to leave ( depending on the case , a few hundred to a few thousand mark ) but i think that is just fair . 
  if they stay , it is more expensive for us and these people need some money to start their life over again in their home country . 
  epcially when it comes to war-torn countries , people need money to rebuild it . 
  it is also cheaper than deportation . 
  it is also not * that * expensive . 
  if all of the people who came to germany in the current crisis were syrians and we would pay everyone a syrian yearly wage to get them to leave ( around 3000 $ , and that was prior to the current war ) , we would have to spend around 4 billions . 
  which is n't that much money . 
  -- -- -- on a sidenote , i think it is also noticeable that the the distribution of refugees in europe in the balkan wars is very similar to the current situation : germany taking the lions share , austria , the netherlands , and sweden each taking in much more refugees than france and the uk combined . 
  [ german source ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/ds27_2_d.htm ) the graph at the bottom shows the total number of bosnian refugees in germany . 
  accurate , but i have to add that we will have to keep the most severe cases . 
  pretty much like in the post-balkan war period . 
  most left , a few ten thousands were allowed to stay even though they were on benefits . 
  but i 'd say that 's neglectable . 
  it 's the opposite actually . 
  there are different definitions of that word - it is completely fine :  ghetto : an area of a city , especially a very poor area , where people of a particular race or religion live closely together and apart from other people, 
  the largest part of bosnians went back actually . 
  how can you sanction them more than taking their money away ? 
  the only step above that would be prison . 
  and that would be ridiculous . 
  well , the government pays the bill for the housing . 
  so it can simply assign a location to someone , whether they like it or not . 
  the government directly pays the landlords , so it is not possible that they take the money to live somewhere else . 
  additionally , they wo n't recieve benefits if they refuse to live at their assigned location . 
  ( and even if they recieved benefits , the money is not enough to pay for a flat somewhere else ) . 
  it is a lot less difficult than deportations ( at least for the government ) . 
   refugees will be made to live `` where we as the state see as appropriate , and not where the refugee sees as appropriate . '', 
  to specify this : the government will do this with the people that are on benefits . 
  the people that have a job and can support themselves are ( naturally ) free to move whereever they want . 
  i would n't consider it a personal attack , but whatever . 
  fair enough . 
  it probably was n't necessary . 
  the only reason why you should choose hawaii over europe is because you like the destination better . 
  the terrorism risk in europe is still very low - you are more likely to get struck by a lightning than to die by a terrorist attack . 
  to apply his logic : `` fair enough , but if there are laws dictating that you can not kill people , let 's not call it it a free and independent country '', 
  since , as i already explained , the board has several media representants , it is self-restraint from the side of the media as a whole . 
  and again you are missing the point . 
  he simply outlined why it is important that newspapers stick to the facts . 
  it does not matter whether it is targeted at a specific person or a group of people or even a whole religion . 
   fair enough , but if there is laws dictating what you can and can not publish let 's not call it a free and independent press . 
  this is not about `` laws dictating what you can and can not publish '' . 
  it is a matter of self-restraint by the press . 
  it is not the government that decides anything here . 
  and it is not about opinions , it is about facts .
