  holy shit what a mess . 
  well , in the end it does n't matter who proposed it . 
  all that matters is this stuff getting funded . 
  it does n't . 
  you should take a look at the oecd data . 
  the last 15-year plan set the budget at 10 billions , and we constantly spent around 10 billions ( actually slightly above that ) . 
   i grew up in germany and most crime was committed by the turks back then we all know it this is utter nonsense . 
   how many terrorists went to iraq to fight against american soldiers rather than carry out attacks in places like europe and north america ? 
  it 's only now , after american forces are largely withdrawn from the area that we 're seeing the alternative : jihadists groups consolidating power , and terrorists flowing back into europe and north america to carry out attacks . 
  the war on terror denied terrorists a sanctuary area to organize , train recruits , and oversee attacks . 
  actually there were n't any islamist terror attacks in europe prior to the engagements . 
   there were no tens of millions of iraqis , afghans and syrians fleeing the middle east while american forces occupied iraq and afghanistan . 
  this was because while terrorism was a problem , it was an insurgency rather than a full blown war . 
  there are always going to be refugee issues with any conflict , but in 2006 there was not an entire country 's worth of people trying to move into europe . . 
  there is a difference between deploying troops in the first place and ending the deployment . 
  it is pretty widely assumed that isis could grow * because * of the ealier us involvements in the region , * because * many of its leaders were further radicalized in guantanamo bay . 
   in terms of lives lost , this `` war '' has been one of the least deadly conflicts in history . 
  more soldiers are surviving previously fatal injuries due to advances in battlefield medicine , personal armor , and expedient evacuation capabilities . 
  even those who are maimed , are driving a massive surge in the development of prosthetic limbs and even limb regrowth research ; something that benefits far more people than just soldiers . 
  the western forces alone lost over 5k people in a way that they did not ` win ' . 
  i would n't call that a success . 
   the cost of staying free is never going to be cheap , but the alternative is death and slavery ; we need only to look at the current situation in the middle east to see that . 
  the alternative to fighting to survive is extermination . 
  nonsense . 
  have n't they already started ? 
  the first floodgates are about to rebuilt in the next years . 
  thanks , no need for that . 
  we have our own transfer model in germany . 
  and no , our exports might be boosted by the low euro , but pretty much all german politicians show opposition to the weak euro . 
  is n't that dobrindts resort ? 
   is n't it a bit misleading to call maintenance an `` investment '' project ? 
  it is completely fine if you look at the definition of `` investment '' . 
  plus that article is not very precise . 
  given the other information i have on the investment program , enhancing current roads ( 6 lanes -  8 lanes ) would fall under `` maintenance '' here . 
   if anything , the increase from 10 to 15 billion only goes to show that the 10 billion/year between 2003 and now was n't even enough to keep existing roads from falling apart . 
  well , it certainly is a step in the right direction . 
  i would actually argue that we mainly focussed on the new states and forgot to maintain the old infrastructure . 
  we are paying the bill right now - every second autobahn bridge is under reconstruction ( at least it feels this way ) . 
   but let 's see where 's the money coming from well , it ca n't be that hard to find five billions somewhere . 
  especially when the economy keeps prospering like it is currently . 
  what do you want to tell me ? 
  did the ` war on terror ' improve anything ? 
  it has maybe improved conditions in afghanistan a bit . 
  but if you compare cost ( especially lost lifes ) and result , it was not really worth it . 
  and in the end , it does not matter . 
  the us chose to fight these wars , no matter whether it was actually stupid or not . 
  these wars , no matter what you think of them , have caused the us military budget to increase , not the european countries not spending on their military . 
  i was not talking about germany . 
  i was talking about large infrastructure investments in southern europe . 
  if you check the oecd data , you will see that it was not germany that caused the peak . 
  15 billions dont seem that small when you consider that the whole eu spent 49 billions on transport-related infrastructure in 2012 . 
  previously , we accounted for around 15 % of eu spending in this area , 15 billions mean that we significantly step up our game . 
  according to bearingpoint , the peak was in 2007 at over 120 billions , but this was ended by the financial crisis ( and as we see , a lot of these investments did not result in anything that would actually help the country ) . 
  on average , the eu countries used 2.6 % of gdp for infrastructure investments in the years between 1992 and 2011 . 
  the article is just about direct government spending though . 
  [ here 's oecd data ] ( https://data.oecd.org/transport/infrastructure-investment.htm ), 
  this is actually super decent news . 
  we are in dire need of more investments for our infrastructure . 
  especially focussing on  importance of transport routes for the nation is the right thing to do . 
  it doesnt really help if we are building super nice roads nobody uses . 
  within the next fifteen years , we will enhance 1700 km of our autobahns ( which is around 15 % of its current total length ) and add 850 km . 
  the mobile experience is actually a lot better than accessing this site via pc . 
  which is extremely important since the people coming here usually access the web via mobile . 
  it is also worth mentioning that there are even more reasons to keep your troops in germany . 
  first of all , it is the headquarter of your missle defence in europe , it allows direct cooperation with the other nato states ( without having to travel to the us/europe every time ) plus you need it for your drone strikes in significant parts of the world . 
   i do n't see how you can possibly argue anything other than the american citizens are clearly the worst off from this situation , whereas the europeans benefit . 
  the question is whether their military spending would go down in case europe spent 2 % as well . 
  the us is n't gon na give up on maintaining their nukes ( they spend ~ 35 billion per year on their nukes , this is more than most european nations spend on their military in total ) . 
  they wo n't give up on maintaining fully operational carrier fleets ( which are extremely expensive to build and maintain ) and they will continue to have the biggest air force in the world . 
  by a large margin . 
  you should have a look at [ this ] ( http://www.heritage.org/static/reportimages/d5640dc5effc0f7c3eed5d4893c0d5b0.gif ) . 
  the us military exposure has in fact * decreased * since the time when most european nations actually spent 2 % on their military , which was until the mid 90s . 
  you see that the budget went up since 2001 - and that is not because of increased spending on europes security but because the us insisted on fighting their stupid wars in iraq and afghanistan . 
  blaming europe for high military spending in the us is not totally beyond reason , but it is stupid to call it the main factor . 
  and additionally , the us spends more on its miltiary than its own army wants to . 
  senators blocking the total military budget unless the army buys stuff built in their constituency is an actual thing that is happening . 
   tittentasterstra\u00dfe this is n't a real street though . 
  it is how the street is called , but it is not the official name . 
  well , all of your choices are great , but it totally depends on what you are interested in . 
   rejoining is vastly different to joining . 
  will require a much higher level of public support . 
  well , of course . 
   rejoining the eu after a devastating war with russia to show solidarity ? 
  it 's all hypotheticals . 
  it 's a bit silly to discuss . 
  it truely is . 
   we 'd never grovel just because our economy is fucked . 
  too much pride . 
  which is a shame because it would mean you are consent with worse conditions just to keep your pride . 
   i just used war as some kind of major unexpected event . 
  if anything , it will be the aftermath of some event . 
  the uk would be pretty stupid to make such a significant move when either they or the eu are in a significant crisis .

   the only way we 'd ever consider joining again is if the eu was so good that concessions were n't needed to get us to join . 
  well , the precedent would be you joining the ec . 
  it was n't ` good ' in the levels that you are demanding . 
   no , it 'd need to be doing a hell of a lot better than us for us to rejoin . 
  what about an economic downturn accompanied with rising levels of unemplyment . 
  ( which is unlikely , i know , but just for the question ) .
