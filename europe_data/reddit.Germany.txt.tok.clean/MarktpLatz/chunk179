  the only problem we are facing if we are realistic is that our parliament becomes bigger and bigger due to the balance mandates . 
  it is meant to have 598 members , we are sitting at 620 and we could face 700 + at some point in case of `` unfortunate '' election results . 
  we can not change this as we can not change the number of constituencies for factual reasons . 
  but i 'm willing to take that in return for the fairest vote weight of all applied election methods . 
   as germany is clearly not following the laws tell me what laws we broke by doing what . 
   lets not forget who opened this flood gate by propagating open door policy ... look at [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/85/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_eu-28%2c_january_2014_%e2%80%93_september_2015.png ) . 
  the alleged ` invitation ' was made in the end of august . 
  if there were any flood gates , they were already wide open at that point . 
   germany should be tried for breaking majority of policies that any schengen member must follow !, 
  we did not . 
   there is no such law that allows undocumented border crossing to anybody just by claiming a `` refugee '' status . 
  the only unlawful action that we took was when we allowed a few ten thousand people to pass germany to denmark and scandinavia . 
  nothing else . 
  we are free to allow anyone to cross our own borders into our own country . 
  and by the way - there is a multitude of countries that were passed on the way to germany . 
  how is that contradictory to my standpoint ? 
   while merkel might have had good intentions , it is obvious that her plan is not finding sufficient approval . 
  well , we will see about that when the deal is acutally being discussed in the next weeks . 
   regarding border `` closure '' : no borders are actually being closed but borders are being controlled which means enforcing the schengen agreement which all members of schengen have mutually agreed upon . 
  it is correct that it ( in most parts ) is in accordance with the schengen rules . 
  does not change the fact that these policies are fucking over greece . 
  i would call the hungarian border ` closed ' . 
  i would also call the external austrian border ` closed ' . 
  they said that they will accept a certain amount of people per day and not let in anyone after that . 
  i would say this qualifies as ` closed ' . 
   nothing is unilateral in this respect . 
  i would call it unilateral . 
  especially the border closure of macedonia ( which i am aware is not a eu member ) caught greece off guard . 
  that 's also what we said at that time : we do not exactly have a problem with macedonia closing the border , but we would prefer it if they talk to greece first . 
  which seems sensible , do n't you think ? 
   schengen/dublin may be imperfect . 
  oh , surely it is . 
   however the current legal status quo is - and must be - the basis for any future european consensus . 
  i do not think that dublin can realisticly serve as basis for anything . 
  we all are seeing currently that putting all the pressure on the border countries is stupid and wo n't work . 
  greece is not capable of dealing with this amount of people . 
   merkel played poker trying to surprise with a policy hoping that everyone will follow . 
  so far we have three or four countries that are having severe issues with this policy . 
  let 's see if we can get them on board . 
  the deal is by no means finished , negotiation can change things . 
   it 's time to acknowledge she lost this attempt and move ahead . 
  what do you mean by ` move ahead ' ? 
  in my mind , you could as well say : `` ah , fuck greece . 
  who cares about them . 
  all that matters is that there are no further refugees coming to the rest of europe '' . 
  something that i refuse to take as a solution . 
  it is funny that you are trying to teach me on my profession . 
  parts of the constitution actually set limits , the fundamental rights generally do n't do that ( they only limit the side that goes * against * the person ) . 
  as i said , the law dealing with refugee status exceeds the asylum requirements in 16a gg , nevertheless it is fully in accordance with our constitution . 
  i am not sure you fully grasp the mechanisms of our constitution . 
  but let me tell you the following : the fundamental rights are limited to the person . 
  i could not go to the court if someone elses rights are violated . 
  the bamf could not go up to the bverfg and sue based on the government doing more than stated in 16a gg for a person . 
  the only one that could sue is the person affected . 
  and this person wo n't sue as it was granted refugee status/a similar status . 
  so instead of trying to make up layman arguments about the german constitution , i challenge you to find a respectable lawyer ( or at least someone that is familiar with the law ) that claims the acting violates art . 
  you certainly wo n't find one . 
  merkels solution is at least an attempt for a european solution for the problem . 
  all other proposed policies are essentially `` fuck greece , we 're gon na unilaterally close our borders '' - this does not qualify as cooperation . 
  instead of picking on merkel , the other governments should think about coming up with a feasible solution that benefits the whole of europe without fucking over greece . 
  if they ca n't - well then dont complain about the one country which tries to do so . 
  you are simply drawing the wrong lines here . 
  you are looking at the issue from the wrong side . 
  the fundamental rights of the constitution construe a minimum what the government has to do . 
  it always can do * more * if it means increasing the rights of people affected . 
  when the bverfg says that people coming here do not need to be accepted based on our constitution does * not * mean that we * must * not accept them . 
  it means that they could not sue to force us to accept them . 
  and quite frankly , most applications here are dealt with based on the normal laws for lower statuses than asylum ( mainly refugee status ) . 
  these are * based * on ( amongst other things ) the general right to asylum , but they exceed the description given in the fundamental rights . 
  to point at a similar situation : art . 
  it does not even mention age or sexual orientation . 
  nevertheless , these things are protected under regular laws . 
  as i said , the government can go beyond what the constitution demands them to do . 
  they could n't suddenly allow discrimination by heritage , but they * can * increase protection to sexual orientation or other things . 
  it 's the same thing when it comes to the right of asylum . 
  there 's a good reason why pretty much no lawyer would argue that the government is violating the right to asylum by their actions . 
  -- -- -- now , it is a little different when it comes to another topic : the borders . 
  the government is generally responsible for keeping germany safe . 
  allowing uncontrolled streams of people to stream into germany as a result of the outter schengen countries failing to secure their borders while most of them can come here without being registered could * potentially * violate the constitution . 
  a former bverfg judge has already stated that , in his opinion , the government is in a violation of the constitution here . 
  but there is only one authority that could determine whether it is : the bverfg . 
  and since nobody has brought this case to the court so far , we simply do not know . 
  and given how things are developing , we will never know . 
  this is a wrong claim that shows that you have very little to no understanding of our constitution . 
  but hey , it fits your narrative , it must be correct . 
  people who do not have a clue should probably remain quiet . 
  there are arguments that the constitution was violated , but these claims are not concerning art. 16a gg . 
  what was done does not violate the asylum part of the constitution . 
   it was germany that invited the world to come here . 
  take a look at [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/85/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_eu-28%2c_january_2014_%e2%80%93_september_2015.png ) . 
  the statement in question ( which was n't an invite by the way . 
  you should probably look up what was actually said ) was in the end auf august . 
  judging by these numbers , it can hardly be an invite and it also proves that germany is not ` responsible ' for anything . 
   people will just think you are too stupid to vote properly if you `` spoil '' your vote . 
  and rightfully so . 
  having assisted on elections before , i can assure you that 95 % of invalid votes are because people are too stupid , they are drawing pictures , signing the ballot , putting in too many choices etc. . 
  why especially nrw ? 
  the afd is faring pretty much like on the federal level in bavaria , and this is despite the csu taking a few pages out of their book . 
  * however * , there wo n't be elections in bavaria for two and a half years , i do no see them staying at 10 % until then . 
  if they are lucky , they will be strong enough to surpass the 5 % hurdle by that point .
