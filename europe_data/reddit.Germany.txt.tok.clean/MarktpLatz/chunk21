  according to that article , we ` convinced ' the people to go back by supporting families returning to bosnia with up to 4000 deutschmark . 
  [ source from september 1998 , in german ] ( http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article630767/250-000-bosnien-fluechtlinge-ausgereist.html ), 
  how so ? 
  refugees are still refugees . 
  the laws are still the same . 
  [ here is a statistic for bosnia and herzegovina ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/ds27_2_d.htm ) the pie chart at the top shows refugees from fromer jugoslavia by country . 
  the diagram is the number of refugees from bosnia and herzegovina in germany over the time . 
  translates to : at this point , the remigration of the civil war refugees from germany is widely finished . 
  there are under 20,000 refugees from that territory left in germany , all of them are difficult cases where sending them back is out of question due to humanitarian reasons . 
  ( 2003 ) its actually quite funny to see that it was germany , austria and sweden who were the main countries shouldering the crisis , just like today . 
  the balkan was n't that nice either after the war . 
  still , we sent the people back . 
  i think people will feel a lot better if we do not only send refugees back but also support the creation of a new state both financially and politically . 
  i by the way do not see any issue with people who are in work , able to support themselves and their family , staying here . 
  ~ ~ ~ ~ instead of downvoting , you could explain why you disagree with me . 
   it would have been possible with balkans aswell iirc ? 
  iirc most of them did not stay here long enough to be eligible for citizenship . 
   and if they want to apply they need to fullfill our normal immigration stuff , which means have an education , have a job , be good at german , and have no big crimes in your history ( like driving over speed limit is okay , mugging people is n't ) , if they fullfill all these and get a citizenship i do n't really see whats wrong with them beeing here :0 correct . 
  however the language requirements for refugees are slightly lower than for `` regular '' immigrants . 
  i do not know what level is required though . 
  why should anybody do the mentioned things ? 
  nobody is going to punish denmark if they do stuff differently , they have an opt-out after all . 
  returning refugees is a ` natural ' thing to do , the eu wont be opposed to it . 
  the overwhelming majority of refugees fleeing the balkan wars have gone back . 
  it depends on the country , they differ on that topic . 
  for germany :  germany used to follow exclusively jus sanuinis until 2000 . 
  since then , it is possible to obtain citizenship if you are born here . 
  however there are obstacles to it :  * one of the parents has to be a german citizen ( refugees can obtain citizenship after six years the earliest ) * alternatively one of the parents has to live in germany for eight years at the time of the birth . 
  * the third way is if the parent has an unlimited permission to stay in germany , which is not the case for refugees if i am not mistaken . 
   idk why most of them would n't go back or be forced back this time depending on the length of the war in syria , people might be able to obtain citizenship . 
  it is possible after six years for refugees in germany .

  our clubs are not . 
  some states already threatened not to supply the stadiums with police for events unless the clubs agree to pay part of the bill . 
  alright . 
  the best thing op can do is simply look at the instructions in the filler cap . 
  general consensus in germany is that 98 is only needed for sportscars , it seems a bit like a scam to me if they suggest it for regular cars , but whatever . 
   i 'm living in berlin for 2 years but my bike does not take gas  fair enough , 
  i think you are mistaken .

  5000 ccm [ e-class ] ( http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/germany/mpc/mpc_germany_website/de/home_mpc/passengercars/home/new_cars/models/e-class/_s212/facts_/technicaldata/models.html ) takes it , same for large audis and bmws . 
  98 octane fuel is only required if you are driving an amg , a porsche or something of this kind . 
  and by the way : i dont know how long you live in berlin , but we had the 92 one until ~ ~ like three years ago . ~ ~ edit : seems it was 8 years , they faded it out in 2007 , time goes fast . 
  that does not fix a single problem for the current asylum seekers on these homes , quite frankly . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  are n't you confusing the 95 with 92 ? 
  how is our military affected ? 
  it has seriously * nothing * to do with the us here . 
  the 12,000 $ include housing , food , education etc. 
  by the way . 
  oh , there very well is still a surplus . 
  sorry i do n't have humor when i 'm tired as hell . 
  al-qaeda urged people to do such things for a few years now , nothing really happened . 
  we had a few people going insane , but i imagine they did not need an appeal from al-qaeda to do so . 
  they have called for this for years . 
  not much came from it . 
  well , shell reintroduced them a while ago . 
  but afaik not that many people were willing to pay the 1 $ premium . 
  i got that by now , thanks anyways !, 
  it just seemed so off to me that he really means that . 
  i mean ... 
  seriously oregon ? 
  we do n't have these people here in europe anymore . 
  well , at least not where i have been . 
  they do nothing but drive up the price . 
  yes . 
  what do you mean by pumping your own gas ? 
  92 , 95 and 98 are the octane numbers . 
  all the three are regular gasoline . 
  some higher end cars require a higher octane fuel . 
  lpg is for gas-powered cars . 
  what do you mean by pumping your own gas ? 
  admittedly the wording was terrible . 
  thats why i said that she should watch it more carefully . 
   i think however that germany misunderstood the need for leadership for a need to command . 
  i disagree . 
  i think they are simply struggling to find the right balance . 
  we never wanted to be the leading nation in europe , we were pretty much ` forced ' into that position . 
  the balance is problematic as we have no real counterpart in the eu that is willing to play its role anymore . 
  only the uk or france are suited for that job . 
   learn to lead rather than command . 
  i get it takes more patience that you may be prepared to invest , which is fair enough , but in which case just be a peer to the other members and settle for that . 
  thats pretty much what i wrote elsewhere . 
  the problem is that the refugee issue is too urgent to really be patient about it . 
  its easy to be patient if you are not getting a lot of refugees , it is quite another thing if you have 60,000 people entering your coutnry in one weekend . 
   if you are going to be the power-house of the eu then you got to learn to lead because for `` reasons '' , the eu just ai n't going to accept command from germany . 
  the eu was pretty much created to prevent a german-led europe . 
  of course commanding wont be the way to go through . 
  however , the cases where germany took a commanding instead of a leading position have been rather rare , yet i disagree with the current attempt to force eastern europe to follow our way , despite me thinking that it is somewhat needed to alleviate the short-term problems . 
  persuading them to follow our suggestion on the issue would be much better fitting for a ` union ' worthy of the name . 
  this however only works if all sides are obeying the ` common ' rules , not only germany was the problem in the last time . 
  i suggested nothing else ? 
  the `` resettling '' option was simply for the case where a woman is afraid to report something because she fears vengeance from relatives or friends of the offender . 
  it did not list it as an alternative to prosecution , but as an addition to * allow * for prosectuion in the first place . 
  it wasnt something of this kind . 
  it was merely some confusion with a technical term . 
  `` we will process all syrians '' is very similar to `` we will accept all syrians '' .
