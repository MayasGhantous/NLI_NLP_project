  which is why i questioned the existence of any precedents that would provide as a basis for this . 
  the case you linked is irrelevant for the current situation by the way . 
  actually i did not even notice it . 
  but germany aside , this runs counter to pretty much any other medical sector rating i have ever seen . 
  usually denmark ranks extremely high and not 34th or something . 
   but this still means ~ 50k more workers from refugees after the non-qualifiers have been departed if we can find people willing and fit to do jobs that are currently open , it is to both our and their benefit . 
   and a lot of extra money for anybody qualified to teach german . 
  not really . 
  they can select where they want to work , but its still a goernment job and not the free market . 
  they wo n't get immense raises . 
  the 1965 immigration act based it on nationality , ideology is still significantly better than religion albeit questionable as long as this ideology does not have the target of destroying the us . 
  the provision you posted does not beat the constitution . 
   `` congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . '' i would argue that action of this kind falls under ` prohibiting the free exercise ' . 
   cost per taxpayer absolute cost is just a very tiny part ( 10 % ) . 
   ** methodology : **  each country was ranked on three criteria : life expectancy ( weighted 60 % ) , relative per capita cost of health care ( 30 % ) ; and absolute per capita cost of health care ( 10 % ) . 
  within each criterion , 80 % of the score was derived from the most recent health-care system assessment and 20 % to changes , if any , over the previous year . 
  relative cost is health cost as a percentage of gdp . 
  absolute cost is total health expenditure , which covers preventive and curative health services , family planning , nutrition activities and emergency aid . 
  changes were measured by baseline-adjusted life expectancy improvements , relative health-care cost increase , cost increase relative to increase in general income and consumer prices , and absolute per capita health-cost increase in u.s. dollar terms . 
  countries were scored on each criterion and the scores were weighted and summed to obtain their efficiency scores . 
  included were countries with populations of at least five million , gdp per capita of at least $ 5,000 and life expectancy of at least 70 years . 
  which is why i think it is a bad way to measure the efficiency/quality . 
  life expectancy alone should not be weighted so heavily as it is affected by other things than the medical sector . 
  again . 
  nationality ! = religion . 
  just because the supreme court permits to ban certain nationalities from entry doesnt mean that you could ban all muslims . 
  tl ; dr translation : village of 100 was supposed to take in 1000 refugees in empty former [ office buildings ] ( http://img.welt.de/img/deutschland/crop147585983/3360192158-ci3x2l-w780/sumte-2-.jpg ) at the border of the village . 
  people were mad , frightened and afraid of increased crime rates , afraid that their children would not be able to roam around freely anymore . 
  two months later , 600 people from 25 nations are housed there . 
  locals are pissed off at merkel , but not because of the refugees but because of the handling of the greek crisis . 
  no issues with the people , refugees seen as polite by the population , 66 new jobs in the facility , 33 of them taken by locals . 
  infrastructure is being improved , the refugees are looking for work but they are not allowed to work . 
  one incident of violence where one refugee pissed another refugee off by switching the light on and off constantly , other refugee hit him to stop that . 
   trump : `` we 're going to make our military ... so powerful that we 're never going to have to use it . '', 
   i 'd argue america needs him . 
  oh god no . 
  trump would manage to piss off half of the world very quickly if his presidency was remotely resembling of his nomination run . 
  he is also plain wrong on some issues . 
   and it 's completely constitutional based on past supreme court rulings . 
  to my knowledge there are no past rulings on similar issues . 
  banning a religion is on a completely different level than banning citizens of a certain country from entering the us . 
  i 'd argue that such a ban would directly violate the religious freedoms . 
  the inflation rates listed for the european countries are wrong . 
  it lists germany and france at 2 % while the actual numbers were constantly below 1 % since 2013 . 
  the only way this could be explained is through the conversion into dollars , but this doesnt make much sense to me as the euro did not really rise between '13 and ' 14 . 
  i would ' t call it ` less anti-putin ' , but his stance is certainly more reasonable than the one of many other candidates . 
  especially when talking about the likes of fiorina , who just do n't want to talk to putin anymore while building up your military in europe . 
  certainly a way to success . 
  european media is barely reporting about the nomination runs yet , reports appear mainly if someone says something incredibly stupid - like 70 % of trumps public statements . 
  it would also directly deprive any state of the power over its own military , likely violating every constitution in existence . 
  sorry , but this inflation data is bullshit . 
  that 's what i meant by ` op fucked up ' . 
  read the article . 
  it was written * before * the 1,000,000 number was released yesterday , but it explicitly states that the number is likely ` close to 1 million ' . 
  op simply fucked up . 
  this would be the biggest genocide we have seen in 70 years . 
  not only is it immoral , it is also not suited to fight the is due to its structure . 
  donald trump is a madman , but he is not * that * stupid . 
  -- -- -- to answer your hypothetical question : somewhat . 
  article 5 does not force anybody to use their military . 
  the treaty is worthless if the countries choose not to honour it . 
  wars are pretty much alwas useless , but if russia attacks , i see no reason not to honour our commitment . 
   the consultants agreed to provide the first six weeks of services free of charge holy fuck mckinsey working for free . 
  the problem here is the word seasonal . 
  the people come here , mainly from poland , to work during the time where there are jobs and then they go back to poland afterwards . 
  having people who are unemployed 3/4 of the year is n't that benefitial . 
  eastern european unemplyoment rates are significantly below the eu average . 
  it 's true . 
  if you are a teacher for german as a foreign language , you can currently choose where you want to work as the demand is so high . 
  * however * , at least for the basic education , it is not necessary that the person is an educated teacher . 
  some teachers recently wrote a simple learning book for our language that can be taught by laymen . 
  yes , it will be a huge struggle , but i am somewhat optimistic because unlike the last time we got large amounts of people coming here ( the guest workers from turkey & co. ) we are aware that we need to invest heavily into education and that we have to make an enormeous effort to integrate these people , to our own benefit . 
  thank you , 
  according to the bamf , the current influx is  50 % syrian . 
  we 're sitting at 54.3 % for november , the same for october . 
  for the whole year it is 33 % , but the trend clearly goes towards 50 % syrians . 
  [ source , german ] ( https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/statistik-anlage-teil-4-aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
   we will never have a reliable number aslong as they keep coming . 
  not really . 
  as far as i remember , the people name their year of entry on application , so we will have reliable data once the entries of 2015 are finally processed . 
  i think you misunderstood something then . 
  people argued that we have to see the opportunities that this influx offers for us . 
  but this was not causation , but effect . 
   we 'll never have reliable data we will have relibale data as soon as all these people are properly registered . 
  the number that is mentioned in the article is coming from a general system used to redistribute refugees inside of germany , the regular asylum process being something different . 
  the problem is that we have a mountain of unprocessed applications and it will take a while to get through them . 
  because some people that are temporarily registered in germany moved on to these countries . 
  we will only be able to judge in the retrospective . 
  doubtful . 
  sure . 
  and then there are people who say politics are boring \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  the number should be somewhere around 1 million + applications in sweden + applications in the netherlands . 
  the problem lies less with constant accomodation of refugees than with housing the people who arrive here during their first one or two years . 
  we still have a lot of facilities that could house refugees . 
  mainly former army barracks ( we still have plenty of them , some with ~ 100,000 m \u00b2 housing space ) aswell as former governmental buildings like [ the former german school for dipolmats ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/ippendorf%2c_gudenauer_weg_134%e2%80%93136_004-.jpg/1920px-ippendorf%2c_gudenauer_weg_134%e2%80%93136_004-.jpg ) . 
  of course all of this would not be optimal , but its meant to be a temporary solution anyways . 
  and last but not least , we have lots of unused houses in the rurual areas . 
  this would make a lot of sense . 
  both in terms of colalteral damage done ( infrastructure , civilians ) and monetary expenses . 
  you know the saying - modern warfare is when a $ 200m jet drops a $ 100,000 bomb on a 3 $ tent .
