  it lays down the principle of the primacy of the law of the european union over the law of the member states . 
  this principle , which has been developed by the court of justice in its case-law , has long been recognised to be a basic principle and a key aspect of the functioning of the union . 
  the constitution simply gives it a higher profile by incorporating it into a key part of the treaty . 
   article i-7 confers on the european union legal personality . 
  following the merger of the european community and the european union , the new union will therefore have the right to conclude international agreements , in the same way as the european community can today , but without compromising the division of competences between the union and the member states .

  that not what we are talking about here . 
  when we change the treaties , this rule can be declared void . 
   apparently , it would only take a majority vote of the eu countries to change eu treaties to give the ecb the necessary powers . 
  where do you read that from ? 
  according to art . 
  48 iv 2 teu , changes need to be ratified by * every * member state . 
  since the relevant parts for the ecb are layed out in the tfeu , this applies . 
  the simple majority is only suited to let a suggestion enter into review by the convention of eu institutions and the member states . 
  there is another way for changes ( art . 
  48 vii teu ) , but that requires an unanimous vote in the first point . 
  germany is actually one of the countries more open towards treaty changes . 
  it will be harder to convince poland in some areas and france in others . 
   british ministers are confident that the ecb 's concerns can be addressed , possibly with a treaty clause making clear that every eu member apart from britain and denmark is still expected to join the euro . 
  talk about the brits not wanting to ` get special treatment but change the rules for everybody ' . 
  since the changes require unanimty , this wo n't run . 
  if the relevant legal specifications get touched , they will have a hard time limiting the change to the uk and denmark . 
  if poland wants an optout in this case aswell , they will likely get one . 
  this is not a negotiation between the uk and germany where they can just say ` fuck everybody else ' , it is a negotiation involving every single one of the eu states . 
  apart from this - the ecb is not a political institution or it at least is not supposed to be one . 
  it is none of their business whether other countries join the euro or not as it is a political decision , not a monetary one . 
  well , point me at a german breach of the basic eu principles and one of the additional treaties cameron seeks to reform . 
  yes , but contrary to common belief , nato art . 
  5 does not force us ( or anybody else ) to use our military . 
  the article completely relies on the other member states to obey it and provide military help - everything that happens happens because the other countries honour their commitment , not because they are forced to do so . 
  there is no way to punish countries not complying , and it also does not matter , because the damage is done anyways by the time such a punishment would happen , if there was any . 
  if poland invoked art . 
  5 , our parliament would have to decide on allowing the use of military force . 
  i am convinced that they would allow it , but it would likely not be an immediate response ( immediately meaning within an hour after the attack ) . 
  it would be different for france and a lot of other countries who dont have a principle like a ` parliament army ' . 
  it is also not off the table that our executive organs would simply ignore the constution to send help immediately . 
   we also deserve to be defended in case of war . 
  well , assuming that we are willing to defend you , it does n't matter whether the jets with nukes are starting in germany or poland . 
  its easier to say ` ban all sharia courts ' when people dont really understand how it works . 
  ignoring that this is legally not possible and that the tools to ` fight ' the bad effects are already here . 
  is there actually any will in the us to do so ? 
  two republican mps do n't really matter , given how militaristic parts of this party are and given that the president is still obama . 
  it entirely depends on how the next us election goes , i 'd say . 
  and realitistically spoken - nukes on polish territory will damage relations with russia far more than it would increase the polish defense . 
  since eveything is dependent on us consent anyways , it does not really matter whether the nukes are in poland or germany . 
  we did in no way breach any of the fundamental principles of the eu . 
  ever . 
  the additional treaties are something different and cameron does not seek to reform those currently as far as i am concerned . 
  we live in representative democracies . 
  the frence people wo n't hold a referendum to determine whether the french govt should support a brexit or not . 
  frankly spoken , what the french public wants does not matter . 
  all that matters is the position of the french government . 
  that 's the legal and real truth though . 
  yes , the treaty of rome had these provisions , but the treaty itself presented no means of punishment for it . 
  it is widely seen as an objective without legal consequences at that time . 
  maastricht was meant to create binding rules to compliment these general target specifications . 
  the freedom of movement is a principle layed down in [ art . 
  49 tfeu ] ( https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjul6xbomxjahvfga8khqxudk4qygqiljab&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2feuwiki.org%2ftfeu%23article_49&amp;usg=afqjcngne4bzbhr8ggnf1gpyhuj9gpcbyw&amp;sig2=5-em3p-we-mpflkfbe1ysg ) and the rule preventing discrimination is [ art . 
  18 ] ( http://euwiki.org/tfeu#article_18 ) . 
  the relevant provisions for consequences of breaches are the [ art . 
  tfeu ] ( http://euwiki.org/tfeu#article_259 ) . 
  this term is used for the us and other countries aswell . 
  upper house : representants of the states/clerus/etc . 
  - controlling instance . 
  lower house : lawmaking parliament . 
  our ` upper house ' is the * bundesrat * . 
  other languages use the same term aswell - france uses `` chambre haute '' for the bundesrat . 
  admittedly we wanted strict rules , but in a way that they could not be used against ourselves . 
  they wo n't . 
  france is pretty much the biggest proponent of the eu . 
  you know that the stabily and growth pact had provisions on how to punish and that this could be negated by the european countries ? 
  this is entirely unlike the basic treaties for europe . 
  if you do not act according to them , if you hinder the freedom of movement unilaterally , you will simply get thrown out/your country will be denied the benefits . 
  you are really comparing apples with pears here . 
   germany , go fuck yourself . 
  you 've said that already . 
  hugo boss still produces the highest tier of their clothes in germany ( tailor-made stuff ) . 
  [ trigema ] ( http://bilder.bild.de/fotos-skaliert/stand-quailtaet-23480744/1,w=583,c=0.bild.jpg ) ( the monkey is usually presenting their ads , no joke ) still produces regular clothes in germany with 1000 employees . 
  they have some kind of weird boss . 
  [ lloyd ] ( http://www.herrenausstatter.de/struktur/schuhe/lloyd/images/0815_lloyd_schuhe_dt.jpg ) produces ( at least partly ) in germany . 
  uhm no ? 
  just the threat of the uk leaving will not persuade the french to accept whatever the uk wants . 
  france would possibly back this if fn was in power , but they are not and france will likely not hold elections until shortly before the latest possible date for the referendum . 
  exactly . 
  so the result is less the existence of these courts ( at least in non-criminal matters ) than lack of knowledge about the legal nature of these courts and their decisions . 
  first of all : dublin is entirely different to the eu treaties . 
  secondly , germany did not annul the dublin regulations . 
  there are provisions in that very treaty that make germanys acting completely legal and compliant with the rules . 
  well , because , purely legally speaking , they are practicing arbitration there , which is an accepted way of settling disputes . 
  the ` judgement ' needs the consent of both parties to enter into force . 
  if both disputing parties agree , you can apply any law you wish . 
  you can apply the sales law of belgium , australia , or tansania , or as in this case , the sharia . 
  it simply does not matter as long as everybody is consent with it . 
  actually it is in the very interest of the state that people try to settle their disputes outside the legal system . 
  concerning the regular legal system , the ` judgements ' of these arbitrations work freely after the principle * nullo actore , nullus iudex * ( there is no judge if there is no plaintiff ) . 
  they can also become legally enforceable , depending on the structure of the general legal system . 
  * however * , there have to be limits to this system . 
  it is not tolerable that courts like this are used to circumvent the state primate for criminal prosecution . 
  it is also not tolerable that a system like this comes to ` judgements ' that are completely incompatible with our society and our values . 
  the only thing that can help here however is criminal prosecution of people who arbitrate in criminal matters and education education education .
