   but this information has not been confirmed . 
  this information was declared false . 
   shortly after that , a suspected bomb was found at the train station in hanover , and it too was evacuated . 
  they should maybe add that it was just the box of a scientist who accidentally left it in the train . 
  no threat . 
  damn , you beat me to it while posting . 
  the census took place in whole europe , not just portugal . 
  in 2011 the [ europe-wide census ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_european_union_census ) took place , adjusting numbers that were just based on calculations developed from earlier numbers . 
  you will also see a sharp decline of germanys population in that year . 
  unfortunately only a small number of mosques in germany is decent-looking . 
  most of them ar so-called `` backyard mosques '' - former flats , offices or small stores turned into a mosque . 
  it looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/wuppertal_fatih-moschee.jpg ) . 
  some of the bigger ones are also a bit [ run-down ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/hh-moschee.jpg/800px-hh-moschee.jpg ) . 
  the su-24 is used by iran , iraq and syria in that region . 
  [ this one is in cologne ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/ditib-zentralmoschee_k%c3%b6ln_-_april_2015-7489.jpg )  note : this is not a discussion about islam , islam in europe , or the politics of specific mosques . 
  it will probably turn into a downvotefest . 
  you do know that we could add two million or more refugees on social benefits and our rating would not be affected the slightest ? 
  ten years ago , we had two million more unemployed people . 
  triple a rating . 
  and that was in conditions much worse than today . 
  our economic basis is pretty sound . 
   notably , the `` mosvka '' battle cruiser will begin sentry duty along the coast of latakia , where russia operates an airbase . 
  this however is not a direct resonse to the su-24 . 
  the * moskva * has been supposed to join the conflict for [ over a week ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/11/18/world/europe/ap-eu-russia-syria.html ) . 
  contrary to turkey , russia has not the slightest legitimation to shoot down anything there however . 
  given that the * moskva * is supposed to cooperate with the carrier group of the * de gaulle * , i would say that it is very unlikely to have a single missle fired against any kind of aircraft . 
  this was not open aggression and not a nato country with a pretty powerful military though . 
  if i am not mistaken it only applies to people born after 2000 . 
  there is one thing preventing this though : one of the parents is required to have an unlimited residency permit . 
  which is not the case for the refugees , their permission is limited . 
  even if it is renewed , it is not ` unlimited ' . 
  it was pretty obvious that it was a russian plane and that it had no intention of attacking turkey though ? 
   you 're debating how feasible it is not to take them . 
  but a statement for refugees is just that . 
  if it is not legally possible to do it , it is a lie . 
   you could just not let them in . 
  sorry , you 're coming from austria . 
  nope . 
  austria is safe you 're not getting in . 
  and you 're threatening that any country may and should do this . 
  this would be equal to killing schengen and we will not do that . 
  plus it would bring every country south of germany on the verge of collapse . 
  we had 180,000 people come here in the last three weeks . 
   you also would have stated they will be forced to be registered at arrival . 
  and with registration you know where they entered . 
  this is already the legal scenario which is n't enforced by the border states . 
  partly due to lack of capacity , partly because it is easier to let them pass . 
   and before we did we could also claim `` that would n't run on the eu '' . 
  be realistic . 
  we cant pursue this policy without critically endangering the stability of the eu . 
  i do not see a single eastern state voting in favor of it . 
  the uk would opt out . 
  denmark as well . 
  sweden is full . 
  france has other problems . 
  i simply do not see it run . 
   also portugal is also bringing them from syria and egypt , so with did more than the negotiated share . 
  also the negotiated share is in a context where many countries are taking refugees who moved there on their own to apply for asylum . 
  this is generous from the side of portugal , but not the regular case in the eu i am afraid . 
   point is instead of encouraging pilgrimages , which was what merkel did , we should have been trying to avoid them and push for more ordered redistribution , after registration , straight from arrival points or even from outside europe . 
  the mentioned problems stand in the way of this . 
   you did n't say what exactly was a lie . 
  ` no member state is required to provide you with asylum if you 're coming from a safe state ' is a lie . 
  because it does n't make any sense in regard to europe . 
  we ca n't send people back to a state other than the first state they entered the eu . 
  since this is usually greece , there is no way of solving this problem . 
  we cant send people to austria because it is a safe state they passed . 
  dublin only allows for the first country . 
  it changes once we have negotiated with turkey ( the treaty to send back people will not enter into force until 2017 if we cant convince them to change that ) . 
   we do have quotas . 
  at least a large number of members states accepted them . 
  portugal just received the first group of refugees part of its accepted quota . 
  we have also been flying in syrian university students via another program . 
  we negotiated a one-time resettlement for refugees from italy and greece , not more . 
  one of the key requirements of many states agreeing was that it was a one-time thing . 
   and of course nothing stops germany from doing this themselves . 
  push for this mode of action and lead by example . 
  i can already see the headlines : `` germany inviting even more people - will fly them to germany '' . 
  great . 
  honestly - this would draw even more people to europe . 
  unilateral action of germany would do nothing to solve the crisis but increase the pressure on our own system . 
  we would also ` lead ' nobody . 
  i cant see any state joining in on this . 
   sure but i was referring also to any form of avoidance of due process , such as lying in any enquiry , or trying to move to another state , or refusing to register on arrival , etc. 
  can be punished , but it is not that severe . 
  there already are provisions for this in dublin , by the way . 
   `` do not come to germany . 
  you can not roam around europe illegally . 
  all member states have the responsibility to stop you from doing so . 
  and no member state is required to provide you with asylum if you 're coming from a safe state . '', 
  this would be a lie . 
   that greece and italy should be provided with means to process refugees ( rescue , temporary refugee camps , registering and identification ) and contribute . 
  this is what hollande and merkel proposed a while ago . 
  it only works in conjunction with quotas really . 
   quotas/shared responsibility as they did , with refugees being transported by official means from the state of arrival to the assigned state of asylum . 
  wont run politically in the eu . 
   that those caught trying to avoid due process , using fake ids etc should face consequences . 
  regular national law is applied . 
  if you get caught applying for asylum with a fake id , you face a prison sentence up to 10 years ( usually it will be a sentence on parole or a monetary fine ) . 
  there is no possiblity for more severe punishment .
