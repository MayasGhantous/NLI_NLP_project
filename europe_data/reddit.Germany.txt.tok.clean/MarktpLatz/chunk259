  according to the tax foundation , they would reduce the tax revenue by over a trillion dollars per year . 
  so i can understand people who believe in a somewhat smaller government , but this is just ridiculous . 
  not even talking about his rhetoric in other areas , including building a wall , deporting all mexicans and all the other nonsense he is spreading . 
  ** fiorina ** : i want to throw up every time she talks . 
  additionally , she has no record of accomplishing anything . 
  hp was a pretty run-down company when she was fired and no other company wanted her as ceo since . 
  she played the steve-jobs-card at some point in the debates - turns out [ steve ` scammed ' her ] ( https://medium.com/backchannel/how-steve-jobs-fleeced-carly-fiorina-79d1380663de ) . 
  her policies are questionable at best , especially since she is essentially saying `` lets get back to the cold war and create defense mechanisms directed at russia all over europe . 
  ** carson ** : i dont really know what to think about this guy . 
  he proposed a tax plan that would literally ruin the us ( based on a tax rate from the bible , like wtf ) he doesnt believe in evolution , his healthcare proposals are questionable at best , he also has no record and some questionable commitments in the past . 
  ** huckabee ** : he seems like a nice granddad with very conservative values , but certainly not a good candidate for presidency . 
  ** cruz ** : tries way too hard playing tough . 
  ** rubio ** : this guy is pretty well-spoken and clearly won over bush in the last debate . 
  some of his policies are . . interesting , but i think he is somewhat too young and i dont think that he has what it takes for presidency . 
  ** paul ** : i never expected that i would say something like this about rand paul , but in many areas he seems to be more moderate than the rest of the field . 
  which is incredible given his ties with the tea party . 
  ** bush ** : going in to the debates , i expected him to come out on top . 
  simply because his positions were relatively moderate compared to some other candidates , because of his name and because of the backing he has . 
  turns out i was wrong . 
  he pretty much got shred to pieces in the debates and i dont think that he will be the one making it . 
  soms of his proposals are also borderline retarded : `` i have a plan to grow the us at 4 % '' - thats ridiculous and pretty impossible to accomplish . 
  ** kasich ** : seems to recieve all legitimacy from balancing the federal budget two decades ago . 
  he uses every possibility to speak to point at this accomplishment of his , even if that means that he is not talking about the topic of the question at all . 
  however , he has a somewhat sane standpoint in some other areas , he acknowledges that the fundamental opposition of the republicans to some policies is just show and impossible to implement as the consequences would be too severe for the us citizens . 
  ** christie ** : he sounds like he is talking with a full mouth . 
  i dont really like him . 
  i also like how every goddamn candidate is claiming that he is the only one that cut taxes and created jobs . 
  especially when a lot of this job creation has to do with a general recovery from the financial crisis . 
  the opposition to planned parenthood is ridiculous in my opinion . 
  i dont get why the republicans are so worried about the military cuts . 
  even a cut us military spends more than the next 20 nations combined . 
   loved watching daily show / colbert shows reports on the previous elections but it seems that both shows are over so there i 'm a bit disappointed i can not watch all the weird shit some candidates are saying before they get out of the race . 
  well , colbert did some of that stuff in the late show , for like every debate there was , he also had e.g. 
  jeb bush on his show . 
  but in my opinion , the quality/entertainment value is lower than it used to be in the colbert report . 
  this is not a response to my question, 
  why do replies of this kind always come from new accounts ? 
  it helped us accomplish economic success for more than a decade and the overall results were not as bad as often claimed . 
  yes , we have some struggles with parts of these communities , but the overwhelming majority is well integrated . 
  it does n't matter to us what they vote in their home country ( especially considering that a large portion of them has german citizenship by now ) . 
   norway has applied four times for eec and eu membership . 
  in 1962 and 1967 france effectively vetoed norway 's entry , while the later 1972 referendum and the 1994 referendum were both lost by the government . 
  i did n't know that . 
   germany does n't allow dual citizenship with turkey we actually do since a year . 
  if you were born and raised in germany while having turkish parents , you are allowed to keep both citizenships ( its a very recent change though ) . 
  yes , but the numbers were pretty low for years , they surged between 1967 and 1970 . 
  [ here you can see the numbers by years ] ( http://www.bpb.de/cache/images/4/43274-1x2-galerie.jpg?8f829 ), 
  the voting age in germany is 18 for national elections and 16 on the state level . 
  i would say that it is fair and does not need adjustment . 
  if i would adjust anything , it is taking away voting right from people that are not capable of making their own decisions anymore due to mental illness or age . 
   after wwii well , technically you are correct , but i dont think it is justified to call it that . 
  we are talking about the late 60s here , 20 years after the war had ended . 
  we brought a lot of lesser educated people here when we needed basic labour . 
  less educated people tend to vote for parties like this . 
  also , you are not affected by most of what happens in turkey here . 
   fines for violating pollution standards have to be very high . 
  they must not be so high that they could potentially force the biggest car maker in the world into severe struggles . 
  that is ridiculous . 
  i am sure you could beat the system with your expert knowledge in german citizenship laws . 
  i believe in you !, 
  i wasnt aware of this possibility - turns out you were right . 
  i was just thinking about the possibility to get it in six years . 
  actually defeat devices were used before , by other carmakers selling cars in the us . 
  this was in the 90s though and a lot less sophisticated . 
  eight years unless special conditions apply . 
  thanks for the timeline !, 
   i think the pic of the jetta wagon is great , shows you how the cars were marketed here : https://www.cars.com/articles/vw-diesel-crisis-timeline-of-events-1420681251993/[1] yeah , i know . 
  i have lived in the us during a time where the cars were marketed like this . 
  well , a us environmental lawyer commented on this :  `` the maximum is almost never reached , '' steel said . 
  `` the epa will determine an appropriate amount that makes violating the regulation no longer financially worthwhile . '' so concerning this , the price of the car may play a role ( or not ) . 
   is that they kept lying after the epa approached them . 
  they even did a half-assed `` fix '' recall . 
  ca n't comment on that . 
  thanks for the information . 
  we will see how it turns out . 
  i have a hard time imagining the fines exceeding the actual price of the cars sold . 
  what is extremely important is the payment period of the fine . 
  if vw was granted an 18 year payment period ( like bp on deepwater horizon ) , they could pay this without any further struggles . 
   they can sue to have a judge declare the action void . 
  that is pretty tough to do . 
  i dont see this having a chance of success . 
  also , it would damage vw even further so i doubt they will go that way . 
  i think cooperating with your authorities ( as they do ) will be the best way to deal with this crisis while getting the least severe punishment . 
   i believe the fine would be $ 38k per vehicle chrysler recalled eleven million cars and had to rebuy half a million . 
  it seems pollution is more fine-worthy than life-threatening ignition locks - the vws in question total 500k in the us . 
   all the prior examples of cheating were quite limited , so when then wrote this legislation , i doubt they even considered a company doing it in such a huge way . 
  can you link me that law ? 
   the obama administration has been very critical of how the eu deals with us tech companies , so i would n't doubt that he would use this to give a european company a hard time i am aware that they are critical , however i doubt that obama or his administration will be the person responsible for setting the fine . 
   even though it is earned dont get me wrong . 
  i do think that punishment is due and justified . 
  i would just appreciate it if everyone was punished equally without a political reasoning behind it . 
  edit : okay , after some research , 38k is the maximum fine which will likely not be reached . 
  what is a lot more severe is australia with a maximum fine of over a million dollars per car . 
  but as i said , we will have to wait and see how it turns out . 
  probably everything will stay reasonable yet significant so it would be both fair and justified . 
  i would argue that what vw did was still somewhat ` next level ' bad . 
  and it doesnt matter , their name is associated with the cheating currently . 
  and quite frankly , i am more concerned about the fine than the brand damage . 
  i am worried that it will be used as some kind of tool to ` punish ' foreign competition . 
  we are currently talking about fines totalling tens of billions of dollars - chrysler had to pay a fine of 105 millions in a case where over a hundred people actually died due to faulty manufacturing .
