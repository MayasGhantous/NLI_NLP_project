  i invite you to a train travel on the south-north route , the way the asylum seekers going to hamburg are taking . 
  but same applies here - anecdotal experience does not count . 
   and your numbers are for registered refugees . 
  well , we dont have any other numbers . 
  and i suppose the people you met in your shelter were registered people as well . 
  i could maybe understand if someone is challenging numbers from a single source . 
  but distrusting the numbers from all over europe , including the numbers from countries that are extremely sceptical towards immigration is just idiotic . 
  some top-level tinfoil conspiracies here . 
  believe the numbers or not , but please keep your mouth shut instead of contesting official numbers with anecdotal experience and a general distrust in official numbers . 
  i bet you are also not trusting representative opinion polls . 
  following [ eurostat data for 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/12/number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states%2c_by_age_distribution%2c_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) 25 % are below 13 . 
  it is pretty impossible to claim you are 13 if you are an adult . 
  so no , the data is not worthless . 
   i go with the pics i see everday posted of the tracks of thousands and kids an women are definitely the minority by large . 
  so you would rather trust some random media pictures than official numbers ? 
   but keep pushing your agenda posting official numbers is ` pushing an agenda ' now ? 
   reality doesnt agree with you . 
  well , it does . 
  it 's easy to neglect official numbers if they dont fit your narrative , but these are the numbers . 
  a [ europe-wide comparison ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/12/number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states%2c_by_age_distribution%2c_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) ( 2014 ) gives the exact same picture . 
  you are not going to tell me that every european country is faking the numbers , are you ? 
  [ 30 % of refugees to germany in 2014 have been aged 18 or lower ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/452149/umfrage/asylbewerber-in-deutschland-nach-altersgruppen/ ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ouubeli.png?1 ) are the total numbers by age and sex for 01-08 2015 . 
  the number of minors is pretty significant . 
  these numbers are supported by [ the numbers for the other european countries ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/12/number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states%2c_by_age_distribution%2c_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb15_iii.png ) ( 2014 ) . 
  edit : its actually impressive how upset people can get by official numbers . 
  google with youtube does not really care about competition in europe . 
  valve is not afraid of the other platforms either . 
  i would very much say that it threatens their business model . 
  we have yet to see how it will play out eventually . 
  you got ta appreciate the dutch . 
  maybe its a different demographic that gives their opinion on yougov . 
  i am a bit sceptical on internet-conducted polls , especially since the voters for merkels party are underrepresented on the web ( as many of the are older ) . 
  [ the statistic i posted in that other post ] ( http://www.forschungsgruppe.de/umfragen/politbarometer/langzeitentwicklung_-_themen_im_ueberblick/politik_ii/5_arbeit_br.jpeg ) was conducted with the highest standards of polling as [ decribed here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.forschungsgruppe.de%2fumfragen%2fpolitbarometer%2fmethodik%2f&amp;edit-text= ) ( sorry , google translate is a bit rough on this one ) . 
   are you aware of recent polling on the german government that contradicts the yougov poll ? 
  yes , i posted two in this very thread . 
  the government popularity rises and falls with merkel though . 
  [ you mean this ? 
  ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/10/29/german-government-approval-hits-three-year-low/ ) i am somewhat questioning the poll history displayed there . 
  there is no way that the government approval has been negative for three years . 
  merkel enjoyed unprecedented popularity for years , i dont see how that fits . 
  sorry , i actually meant the ecj . 
  was n't focussed i guess . 
  i also did not mean to say that isds is bad with that statement . 
  i am aware of all the hassles cross-border litigation can bring and am also aware that judges are often not educated on international matters and that discrimination of foreign companies can happen , even in the so-called ` developed judicial systems ' of the west ( loewen v. us ) . 
  so as i am one of the people who does n't see isds and the surrounding stuff that critical ( i have recieved countless downvotes for defending arbitration against unfounded claims and irrational fears ) , i am not surprised by your reply ( law student btw ) . 
  edit : it seems that the people fail to see the sarcasm in your post above . 
  people generally like the government . 
  merkel still has a lot of credit here despite the refugee crisis being somewhat detrimental to her popularity . 
  since like two months , she does not rank # 1 in popular politicians here which very seldomly happened during the recent years of her chancellorship . 
  people being in favor of the current government is also caused by a lack of alternatives , both political and personal ( people do not really see people that they would trust with doing the job ) . 
  but we will have to see how it further develops with the refugee crisis . 
  additionally , her popularity rates dropped to levels that would be seen as extremely good in other european countries and were seen as good just one year back , she rose in popularity while dealing with the greeks . 
  we will have to see how it develops further . 
  a lot will depend on how effective she deals with the crisis . 
  but she would not need to take that much of a tough stance , the general consensus is still somewhat positive about refugees , i guess people would be satisfied if the influx was limited in some way . 
  no worries about the downvotes , people who reply usually dont downvote . 
  and i do n't really care anymore . 
  internet points , there are more important things in life . 
  ps : i am not the one downvoting you either . 
  well , i for one would appreciate more competition in the market . 
  it cant harm the customer and will lead to better deals for everyone . 
  it would also mean more investments into the infrastructure which is nice aswell . 
  i just dont see it happening in the next few years . 
  to be fair , there is still a difference between isds and bringing a case to the icj . 
  well , you have to weigh the pros and cons . 
  none of them is . 
  because the internet in europe is generally cheaper than in the us . 
  for most people it does n't matter if they have 50 , 100 or 1000 mbit/s, 
  both are trustworthy . 
  the first one is a non-profit organisation that has conducted the polls for our second ( public ) channel ( zdf ) for over fourty years . 
  infratest dimap ( second poll ) is responsible for the polls of the primary public channel since years . 
  both polls were conducted via automized machine calls . 
  i doubt that google fiber would be competitive in europe . 
  such an action would not prompt immediate results however . 
  spotify surely doesnt want to lose out vs apple music & co. 
  dont know . 
  both of them have been representative polls . 
  maybe the question asked differs a little . 
  even if some things get worse , it may still be worthwhile to stay . 
  this runs counter to nearly every representative poll that has been conducted in germany . 
  there are less positive polls , but even [ these polls ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/crchart-1465~_v-videowebl.jpg ) show 50 % government approval . 
  they 'd do the same as always - fighting a gainst regulation that affects them . 
  this time we happen to support their case . 
  its kinda ironic , is n't it ? 
  well , i am aware that there is more to it than just inflation . 
  as everywhere in the economy , the calculation of these numbers is extremely complex . 
  but following your statistics , there is at the very least a strong correlation between inflation and bond yields ( at least for the mentioned countries ) . 
  fair point about the ez . 
  alright , fair enough . 
  your inflation rate in 2015 is not different to the one of germany . 
  you even went negative this month . 
  the yield of your bonds is amongst the highest in whole europe , higher even than spain or italy though . 
  edit : likely , i misinterpreted the reasons for this , as / u/ewannnn ( wow thats a lot of n 's ) showed below . 
  i am convinced that the big tech companies ( apple , valve , google , facebook et al. ), 
  already have lawsuits against this law in the pipes . 
  hoards of lawyers will ready up to take this apart as it threatens their business model . 
  well , loopholes can be intentional . 
  but you are right . 
  we did not do it and we never intended to .
