  it is n't some grant conspiracy to blame the foreigners . 
  i am simply quoting the crime statistics correctly . 
  your claims that the crime rate is somehow increasing due to refugees lacks any basis . 
  i do not see how you can even contest that given that i linked the official crime statistics . 
  given that i explained to you how your source is misquoting the statistics . 
  every police report so far has concluded that the actual refugees are about as likely as natives to commit crimes . 
  exception are generally people from northern africa or the balkans - people who do not have a chance to get asylum anyways . 
  and in this regard , our politicians are working on ways to make deporting these people easier . 
  many of those from the balkans have already left again and they are not a relevant group in the applications anymore ( unlike two years ago ) . 
  for northern africa , we have to see about the deals . 
  and even if you include these people - as you see the overall numbers of crimes is n't really affected . 
  as i said : 0.0 % change in 2015 - we will have to see how that develops in 2016 . 
   the same pattern is happening in denmark and sweden . 
  this is an argument that you have not brought so far and it is completely irrelevant to the german crime statistics . 
  if you feel like making a point based on the experiences of other countries - fine . 
  but if you start your argument based on claims about the crime numbers that are * inaccurate * you can not really weasle you way out of it with a vague reference to other countries . 
   i must admit i have severe problems understanding your reasoning with regards to immigration and government budgeting . 
  what 's so hard to understand about it ? 
  the welfare payments to unemployed people are pretty much as low as legally possible - barely enough to `` live in dignity '' . 
  for various reasons ( and not all of them are fiscal ) , there is little interest in a drastic increase of these payments . 
  only the * linke * advocates for a severe increase in these payments , the greens to a lesser degree . 
  beacuse of these reasons , no unemployed person will get a cent less due to the refugees who are here . 
   even if the crime which have risen in the last few years ebbed out , it would be unacceptable that our society deteriorate because of our willingness to help . 
  how can you claim that it rose when it in fact did n't ? 
  2011 -  2012 : [ +0.1 % ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2013/pks2012.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) 2012 -  2013 : [ -0.6 % ] ( https://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2014/pks2013.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) 2013 -  2014 : +2 % 2014 -  2015 : +0 %  humanit\u00e4re politik ist keine einwanderungspolitik tibi has spread so much nonsense in this regard ( for example his claims about g\u00f6ttingen were [ just retarded ] ( https://www.hna.de/lokales/goettingen/goettingen-ort28741/professor-tibi-fluechtlingen-schlimm-goettingen-6548171.html ) ) . 
  i can not see how this opinion piece is relevant to our discussion here . 
  obama was n't exactly a left wing populist . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   in economy and social politics mistakes can be severe but they are usually repairable not if they come through the supreme court . 
  trump could potentially appoint four justices in his term ( scalia is dead , three other folks are very old ) which would ensure a ( very ) conservative majority on the court - upholding stupid stuff like a general ban on abortions . 
  since they are appointed for a lifetime , the effects would be there for decades . 
  not in current times , at least talking about the democracies of the west . 
  in germany , it would be outright illegal . 
  you can not simply exile your own citizens . 
  unlikely . 
  if there is one reason why our afd * did n't * rise in the polls , it is the turks . 
  this topic was largely untouched . 
  people only cared about refugees and economic migrants . 
  also : nationalism very likely is much more harmful than `` globalism '' - whatever that is . 
   both afd and die linke are very pro russian neither party is part of the government . 
   there is also many economic deals between russia and germany this is ... not a crime ? 
  we do business with everybody . 
  it is also irrelevant when it comes to war . 
   a representative survey by tns emnid in march 2016 found that over half of germans ( 57 % ) do not support sending german troops to defend nato members such as poland or the baltic states if they are attacked by russia . 
  only one out of three germans ( 31 % ) think germany should fulfill its obligations as a nato member and stand in defense of poland and the baltic states . 
  [ 3 ] this is not caused by us liking russia however . 
  it is caused by a general aversion of military action . 
  it is also in line with the response of other european countries to the same question . 
   in germany , [ ... ] 58 percent of the public oppose the use of military force in response to a hypothetical russian attack on an allied state . 
  opposition in france and italy was 53 and 51 percent , respectively . 
  [ ... ] in the u.s. , 56 percent support a military response . 
  canada was the only other country where more than half the public was in favor with 53 percent endorsing such action . 
  even in poland , where political leaders have been vocal about the need for a stronger nato military posture in light of russian action in ukraine , public opinion is mixed , with 48 percent of those polled supporting a military response and 34 percent opposed . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.stripes.com/news/europe/poll-willingness-to-defend-allies-from-attack-low-in-some-nato-states-1.351606 ) * of the europeans polled , the brits were the most in favor of the use of force to defend their allies ( 49 percent ) . 
  as for the poles , of whom a whopping 70 percent saw russia as a major military threat to neighboring countries , only 48 percent of those surveyed supported military action in case of an attack . 
  * [ source ] ( http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/?fa=60389 )  http://www.newsbud.com/2016/11/09/germanys-social-democrats-to-challenge-merkel-with-pro-russian-ostpolitik-2-0/ given that we were once the center of the cold war arms race , this is not exactly unjustified . 
  no , it is a matter of political reality . 
  you have already proven that you do n't really know much about the topic . 
  every statement you have made so far about the issue has been inaccurate . 
  i will take our governments ( which are not `` treacherous '' , no matter what you claim ) over your obviously unfounded opinion any given day . 
  this is an eec treaty . 
  it would need the whole eu to revoke it . 
  this is further based on an ecj judgement 3 . 
  you can not strip people of their rights that easily . 
  revoking the treaty would mainly cause people newly arriving here not to get these rights . 
  for those already here , it would likely not change a thing . 
  this would be incredibly stupid given that we do not need even more tension with turkey 5 . 
  we would be stupid to revoke the legal status of people that are working and living here . 
  it simply is not worth it . 
   germany [ ... ] is pro-russian wot ? 
  you are wrong on multiple issues here . 
   the large majority of turks in germany do not have german citizenship that 's a bit of an overstatement . 
  in 2011 ( last reliable data ) , we had 1.5 milion turks with turkish citizenship , 800,000 with german citizenship and 530,000 with german and turkish citizenship . 
  the net migration from turkey is negative and the number of turks with german citizenship is incresing over time . 
  we are somewhat close to 50/50 i assume . 
   could be deported wrong . 
  unfortunately , wikipedia has only a german article about it , but as an austrian this should not be a problem for you : [ arb 1/80 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/beschluss_1/80_des_assoziationsrates_ewg-t%c3%bcrkei ) . 
  this agreement effectively ensures that they have a legal right to be here . 
   being member of a criminal organization should void your legal status automatically in any country . 
  this is wrong on so many levels , i do not even know where to start . 
   source : https://www . 
  gatestoneinstitute . org/9229/germany-lawlessness you do realize that even your source does n't talk about a `` 40 % increase in crime in germany '' like you claimed but about a 40 % increase amongst refugees/asylum seekers ( your source inaccurately talks about `` migrants '' - the total migrant population is much bigger ) ? 
  and even then - the quoted data fundamentally fails to be realistic about this . 
  it somewhat accurately claims ( even though for the wrong reasons ) that `` the actual number of crimes committed by migrants in germany may have exceeded 400,000 '' ( 463.889 ) but fails to see that almost all of these `` crimes '' are related to asylum and residence law . 
  if you take `` real '' crimes - the number drops to 114.238 in 2015 . 
  the increase from 2014 to 2015 was lower than the increase in the number of refugees/asylum seekers in germany ( overall , we saw an increase of 79 % from 2014 to 2015 while the number of refugees/asylum seekers increased by 440 % ) . 
  i 'd also like to add [ the most recent report ] ( https://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/kurzmeldungen/lage-kriminalit%c3%a4t-kontextzuwanderung-1-2016.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) . 
  your source is bullshit and the same is true for your claim . 
  as i said , the overall crime in 2015 ( excluding asylum and residence laws ) did not see * any * change . 
   i think we misunderstand each other here . 
  many people view it as an injustice that immigrants automatically get access to lavish welfare system . 
  this does not make this any more true . 
   money they would other get back in form of increased spending on welfare , pensions , health care or tax decreases . 
  as i said , this would not happen . 
  otherwise , the money would simply be used for reducing the national debt . 
  or for greece . 
   this is n't artificial nor theoretically -- just look out the window . 
  for the reasons i named , it very much is . 
  / r/travel might be the place to go . 
  / r/askeurope is mainly for other stuff .
