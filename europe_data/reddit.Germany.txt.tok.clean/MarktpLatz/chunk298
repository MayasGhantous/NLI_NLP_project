  according to the [ world bank ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.uem.1524.zs?year_high_desc=true ) , its 57.6 % in spain , 54.9 % in greece , 44.1 % in italy and even the uk is at 16.7 % . 
  thanks for the translation . 
  it has confirmed everything i suspected . 
  he throws buzzwords like `` protection '' and `` human rights '' around without ever elaborating how they might be violated under ceta . 
  there is no evidence of trade treaties violating human rights . 
  criticism of the way it is negotiated might be appropriate during and before the negotiations . 
  not afterwards . 
  once the deal is finished , all that matters is its content , nothing else . 
  a bad deal does n't get good if negotiated in public and the same is true for the opposite case . 
  he somehow tries to use scepticism in other european states as a justification - thank you , mr. magnette , but you are the representative of the people of wallonia , not of the people of the netherlands or a third country . 
  if these countries deem it appropriate to say no , it is their decision , not yours . 
  what he says about the decision of the german constitutional court is a lie . 
  the court did not say that isds must not happen , it just said that it must not happen during the provisional application . 
  his criticism of terms that are open to interpretation goes against logic - fixing these things to specific issues would ensure that we are actually left with lower protection in the future . 
   officially . 
  but commissioners well remember that ec president has no say in their choosing , but their national government and the party that leads it does . 
  and so it shall when next commission comes . 
  oettinger was not in opposition to merkel , but its nice to show one face to russia and another to real business . 
  and soon afterwards , ns2 comes into play . 
  convinient . 
  i can understand that there is some taste to it , but everything is in accordance with eu rules . 
  ss violated them , we are confident that ns2 does n't . 
   done . 
  thanks . 
  not providing funding does not equal killing it . 
   gunther oettinger , who was nominated by cdu , was one of the main opponent of ss . 
  it does not matter who nominated him - he was opposed to the proposal based on the fact that it violated eu law . 
  not because he did not like it . 
  eu commissioners are not a representative of the party that nominated him or her . 
   let not forget how germany killed nabuccho which would bypass russia back in the days as well read your article again . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  germany was a vocal proponent of south stream . 
  this argument does not matter whatsoever when you are talking about two alternative routes while the source is russia in both cases . 
   so there the video and then the translation . 
  if people are interested i will post the next parts of the translation tomorrow ... well later today . 
  the first eight minutes seem to be just filled with empty words . 
  he essentially spends the whole time trying to create some `` bridge '' between some `` unique '' aspects of wallonia and their vote - ignoring that many parts of europe share the same aspects . 
  i am interested how he continues . 
   did you read the rankings posted in this thread before commenting ? 
  i posted the goddamn rankings here . 
  i simply forgot about libya and did n't see it when i had a second look . 
  i apologize . 
   please define `` civic partecipation '' look it up in the document . 
  the ranking system is fine , he just listed switzerland and the uk as 3/4 instead of 4/5 . 
  he corrected it now . 
  op misread something i guess . 
  australia is definitely # 3 according to the report . 
  i have listed the correct ranking in a comment below , the source is the document op linked . 
  check page 31 of the report ( page 44 of the whole document ) if you want confirmation , 
   unless i misread the list , japan was the only non-european country on the `` best overall '' list . 
  australia is # 3,

  japan ( page 31 )  there is not a single country that appears in the top ten rankings for all the five domains of the ydi . 
  the netherlands is the most consistent top ten performer across domains , as it is in the top ten for three of the five domains .

  barbados, 
   why would it require a large scale offensive to offer support to the ukrainian border agency ? 
  there is something called separatist forces in the way of protecting the border . 
  that 's why you would need an offensive . 
   have you seen how turkey-russian relations progressed ? 
  they spent a few months in confrontation , sizing each other up , and the moment armenia and azerbaijan almost brought them into a proxy war , they both backed off , normalized relations and are now talking defense and gas deals . 
  i would argue that we are in a fundamentally different situation . 
  thing is : there have been good arguments for not sanctioning these countries right now . 
  eu rules were put into place for a reason , yes . 
  we are in this position because some countries chose to ignore the rules .
