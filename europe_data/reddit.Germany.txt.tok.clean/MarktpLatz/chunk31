  i am aware of this law . 
  i am aware of the dublin agreement . 
  however , courts have ( amongst others ) stopped deporting to hungary for various reasons . 
  and its not the issue . 
  dublin violations aside , our very own interest is to separate legitimate asylum claims from the ones without any potential . 
  which can become a lot harder when dealing with people without documents . 
  frankly , it does not matter to the germans what these people did in hungary , all that matters for us is whether they have a passport or not . 
   but laws can be changed fundamental rights cant . 
  we changed the fundamental right of asylum once ( in 1992 i believe ) and it was just very narrowly in the `` still constitutional '' area as the essence was not touched . 
   how can a model be , that you simply do the same thing faster ? 
  there must be more to it . 
  the netherlands are processing claims within 6 days . 
  it seems we are just inefficient in dealing with the issue . 
   if it 's not in time for this wave of asylum seekers , then we should do it before the next arrives . 
  there is no ` next wave ' , its a constant flow . 
  i think you are missing the problem with people lacking identification documents . 
  they will eventually appear in one country , lets say its germany . 
  the people processing their asylum application will ask them for their identification papers . 
  if they have some , we are totally fine . 
  if they dont , there the stuff starts to get messy . 
  for that reason , it does not matter ( at least for the issue i am talking about here , which is also the most prevalent issue with people without id ) whether they refused getting their fingerprints taken in another country . 
  i am advocating for adopting the norwegian/swiss model of dealing with people from countries like kosovo : processing them within of 48 hours and then deport them if they are denied . 
  this reduces the chances of abuse to a minimum . 
  i am not well-read on asylum law to make a judgement whether that would be legal though . 
  a speeding up is required dearly , even for the syrians it can take months , which is completely unacceptable . 
   do you know what the reasons could be to deny asylum to the 0.5 % ? 
  i mean , there is war in syria . 
  already asked myself the same question . 
  also asked here on the sub . 
  so far , i have not found any answer to that . 
  maybe i should consider writing an email to the bamf or something . 
  wow that was a lot of effort . 
  thank you for actually taking the time to try proving me wrong instead of just downvoting . 
   in 2014 , 9.3 % of migrants were from ` unspecified sub-saharan countries ' . 
  this is a larger share than i expected admittedly , however still a lot of percentage points away from the claim that `` they all dont have documents '' . 
  how many sub-saharan asylum requests are there anyways ? 
   http://www.wsj.com/articles/migrant-crisis-continues-at-u-k-france-border-1438266146  `` he added that many of the migrants do n't carry identification or have any money , so `` it would make no sense '' to charge or fine them . '', 
  soft paywall , can not comment on that unfortunately . 
   `` passports and identification documents -- which smugglers tell people they should destroy so as not to be deported -- are torn and strewn about , faces without names and names without faces , old lives left behind . '', 
  http://mashable.com/2015/08/28/american-millionaire-migrants-mediterranean/ i have read about that aswell , about human traffickers telling people to do so . 
  yet this article unfortunately does not give any definite numbers either . 
   over 40 % of migrants found dead could not be identified - or even their country of origin identified :  http://www.borderdeaths.org/wp-content/uploads/preliminary-findings.pd  `` in more than one third ( 41 % ) of cases , the region of origin is unknown and could not be guessed . '', 
  migrants found dead ! = all migrants  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/10/us-europe-migrants-asylum-insight-iduskbn0oq0eu20150610  `` most migrants give their fingerprints only where they want asylum . 
  in recent years , syrians and eritreans -- the most likely to be recognized  as refugees in europe -- have either refused to be fingerprinted in italy or even burned their fingertips to avoid identification , according to an  italian police memorandum sent to local offices last year . '', 
  this does not mean that they do not have documents  http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/un-refugee-agency-urges-hungary-not-to-shut-out-asylum-seekers-20150702-0015.html[7] 70,000 undocumented migrants have entered hungary this year  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/30/us-europe-migrants-balkans-iduskcn0q413y20150730 93,000 have applied for asylum in hungary this year . 
  same again , the fact that people do not want to be registered in hungary does not mean that they do not have identification documents . 
  `` undocumented '' simply means that they were n't registered , for whatever reasons .

  anecdotal experience . 
  i do not deny that it is happening , however i contest that it is happening on the scale parent poster claimed . 
   https://books.google.com/books?id=pf_hhxt2sjkc&amp;pg=pa19&amp;lpg=pa19&amp;dq=europe+asylum+seekers+without+documents&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_dmswuwqux&amp;sig=dc95gxcbl7aey9nzxnjv1-t00ua&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cdsq6aewbgovchmi2dgp4e_uxwivb9kach2_7gyz#v=onepage&amp;q=europe%20asylum%20seekers%20without%20documents&amp;f=false[10] 70 % of migrants in 1994 had no documentation we are living in 2015 however . 
  it was a totally different time and different circumstances . 
   how much more is required to change your mind ? 
  a simple statistic , from government or ngo , as long as credible , would be sufficient for me . 
  i am willing to admit that i underestimated the numbers a bit ( at least in terms of what your first article mentions ) and i also said that we should introduce different means of identifying the nationality of people for that reason ( see post above ) . 
  nevertheless , i stand firm with my point that it is nowhere on the scale that the previous poster claimed . 
  i am fine with someone saying : `` some of them do not even own papers , so it will be difficult to deport them '' , however i disagree with someone stating `` they all dont have papers anyways '' . 
  thank you anyways . 
  pretty hypocritical if you ask me . 
   i have however met a few mexican immigrants who are terrible people . 
  naturally so . 
  nobody claims that all refugees/immigrants are saints . 
  but the same goes with citizens of your own country . 
  there are assholes of any ethnicity in the world . 
   edit : and even if they are , they are not automatically refugees , the status has still to be granted , like i said . 
  which is wasting a lot of resources and time . 
  many people already called for straight up accepting syrians . 
  and i agree with that , the 0.5 % wont make a difference anyways , in fact it would likely be cheaper to accept them . 
  i am not calling the predictions for the population growth of africa unreliable . 
  they seem pretty accurate . 
  however , i think it is impossible to determine what is happening in the future . 
  ten years ago , nobody thought that we would be in the situation we are now . 
  just the ( slim ) potential of it happening should not serve as an argument against taking in refugees currently in my opinion . 
  i never claimed that ? 
  the article this thread is about however talks about the people of iceland taking in syrians . 
  and so was i in the mentioned comment . 
   immigrants are apparently adjusting their fertility rate surprisingly quickly to the country that took them in . 
  nadja milewski from the university of rostock figured out that second generation migrants already differ significantly from their parents in terms of giving birth to children . 
  they have children significantly later and much more rarely . 
  `` the fertility behavior of second generation migrants is more similar to the one of the germans than the one of their parents '' , milewski summarized . 
  the article goes on , listing more examples from other countries . 
  it states that it is more connected to the employment status of the woman than the ethnic origin . 
  population growth will not necessarily increase the numbers of refugees , it mainly depends on how africa develops . 
  if someone is coming from syria , it is a war refugee . 
  end of the discussion . 
  syrians have an asylum acceptance rate of 99.5 %, 
   does n't mean it 'll happen through refugees , but through the fact that pretty much all immigrants to germany have much higher birthrates than the native one . 
  the population is already 20 % foreign national/migrant background . 
  birth rates adapt rather quickly to the new environent . 
  the second generation of immigrants will already only have a birthrate marginally higher than the ethnic population . 
   combine that with the fact that africa 's population is set to explode in the coming decades ... germany is in for a wild ride is all we can say for now the population increase in the last decades in africa has * not * resulted in large amounts of people coming to europe . 
  even now , the lions share that is coming from there is coming from eritrea , a country of origin that justifies getting asylum . 
  nobody coming here is fleeing population growth but civil war ( and poverty for the people that are denied ) . 
  to put things into relation : to reach 50 % , about the * entire * population of the 5 most common countries of origin in terms of asylum requests to germany would have to come here . 
  ( syria , kosovo , albania , serbia , iraq ), 
  how does that influence things ? 
  they will eventually register somewhere . 
  be it in hungary , germany or sweden . 
  it does not make a difference , they will still have no papers and the data will be published . 
  since there are no articles about a wide abuse of this , i have to assume that it is not a common issue .
