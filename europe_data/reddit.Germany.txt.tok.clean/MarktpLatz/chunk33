   this is ridiculous . 
  no fly zones ? 
  giving arms to anti-quaddafi forces who we were told were ` moderate ' rebel groups ? 
  the place is somolia now . 
  this is not ` causing ' the issues and i explicitly mentioned that the nato became active after unsc resolution 1973 which included the erection of a no-fly zone . 
   us brokerage of some of the largest arms deals in history to saudi arabia and the gulf states ? 
  where did those weapons end up ? 
  where were you when this was going on ? 
  why are you so indignant and cocksure when you openly discredit your understanding of these geopolitical issues by asking novice naive questions ? 
  selling weapons to countries like saudi arabia was not an action exclusive to nato member states . 
  these armies are also operating with russian gear . 
  and look at what kind of weapons you are mainly seeing in the civil wars - not german g36 , not american rifles , no milans ( except for the ones provided to the kurds ) but rpg-7s and kalashnikows . 
  this is the issue . 
  op claims that they * caused * the crises . 
  i have no problem saying that they in some or another way influenced the development of that area , however claiming it to be the `` cause '' is a bold claim in my opinion . 
  you claim that nato caused the uprisings and the subsequent civil wars in northern africa . 
  yet you fail to provide any source for that claim and take refuge in generalities . 
  arms deals were done with the northern african regimes , in fact they were supported for quite a long time . 
  many nato members did not even react until there were massive demonstrations in these states , politicians were hesitating on letting the autocrats fall . 
  yes , you can talk about the influence of the us invasion in iraq and the impact that it had on the creation of the daesh and the subsequent influence on surrounding countries . 
  claiming that it caused the uprisings in northern africa or the civil war in syria is daring , to say the least . 
  did some western countries have some influence on what happened ? 
  likely . 
  this does not make the nato responsible for the war in syria though . 
   what consitutes a reliable source in your opinion . 
  a source that is * not * some kremlin-funded agency or an agency with a clear anti nato bias and not some random blog . 
  well you are . 
  you are still not providing any source . 
  and you are not fulfilling my request for a reliable source . 
  attacking me personally does not change the lack of it . 
  the nato did not get active until the unsc resolution 1973 . 
  actions of nato members are * not * actions of the nato ( and even these actions are questionable ) . 
  any reliable source that would support your claim ? 
  edit : funny to see that you edited it to say `` nato members '' instead of nato now . 
  a serious plan of what kind ? 
  the person who comes up with a realistic solution to the issues we are facing would deserve a medal ( or even a nobel price ) or something . 
  i thought the same . 
  after checking the [ eurostat data ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/e/ec/first_time_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu-28_by_citizenship%2c_q1_2014_%e2%80%93_q1_2015.png ) on that issue i am not that convinced that the applications will get less during the winter anymore . 
   when i meet germans today i find that i mostly use the informal `` du '' what part of germany are you talking about ? 
  about some specific part or about germany in general ? 
  there was no change . 
  merkel told the girl she could n't stay * if she did not met the requirements for asylum status * . 
  nothing has changed about that . 
  the point this article makes is that we take in * legitimate refugees * , which means that people who do not have valid claims will be denied asylum . 
  even if we are talking about the first paragraph , you editorialized the title . 
   militia groups such as islamic state does * not * mean that the is is making `` over 320 million dollars a year '' . 
  no , i am not fine with the is earning money . 
  however , editorializing titles does not make this any better . 
  it is admittedly a problem , inflating numbers and claiming wrong facts is detrimental for a neutral discussion nevertheless . 
  we can have a ` neutral ' discussion about this any day , however only if you bother to post the `` regular '' title . 
   can charity money be investigated and who can do it in an unbiased way ? 
  decades of aid money ` disappearing ' ( partially ) can make you come to the conclusion that it is either not possible or that there is no will to do so . 
  it would require another 50 % increase from the number we are ` getting ' this month and that number remaining stable until the end of the year ( i have a hard time imagining ten thousands of people arriving here amids the winter ) . 
  he simply outlined that you editorialized the title . 
  which is forbidden by the sub rules . 
  the title you wrote indicates that the is is earning 320 million from the business , which is just wrong . 
  it is questionable that the whole business even hit 320 million , 323 million is the maximum that they could have earned according to the report . 
  i am just gon na go ahead and quote our favorite mod :  j\u2019ai d\u00e9list\u00e9 ce sujet car le titre de l\u2019article a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9ditorialis\u00e9 . 
   i delisted this submission because the article 's title has been editorialised . 
  to editorialise titles is bad . 
  i invite you to resubmit this link with using the original title . 
  to expand a title for precising it is ok ( `` blabla -- a short text '' ) . 
  disambiguations are also ok ; for example replacing `` he did that '' by `` [ mr something ] did that '' . 
  it is not even said that it `` generates '' 320 million . 
  revenue ! = profit . 
  and the source ( which this claim is based on ) talks about 250-323 million . 
  of course , `` over 320 million '' sounds more scary and will thus be adopted into the headline . 
   - all i 'm saying is that on one had we have reports about poor refugees that have have only shoes , toruses and shirts looking for our help this is the same as saying `` they have smartphones , so they cant be refugees '' . 
  again , we are talking about war refugees and not economic migrants here . 
   a foreigner or stateless person can acquire german citizenship through naturalisation . 
  this occurs by virtue of an administrative order and takes effect upon presentation of a naturalisation certificate . 
  naturalisation is only performed on request . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.sachsen.de/en/1444.htm )  you have a right to naturalisation if you fulfil the following conditions :  * [ ... ]  * your habitual , lawful place of residence has been in germany for eight years ( this period can be reduced to seven years if you attend an integration course successfully , and can be reduced to as few as six years in the case of special integration measures ) , [ source ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/einbuergerung/indeutschland/indeutschland-node.html )  sources report that refugees can apply for german citizenship after six years ( us 8 apr. 
  2011 , 16 ; pro asyl 8 dec. 2011 ) , if they meet the criteria ( ibid . ) . 
  translates to :  the time of the asylum request processing is counted for accepted refugees . 
  this is the case when talking about people with legitimate aslylum claims according to the constitution or when there is an obstacle to deport people according to [ german law ] ( refugees after the refugee convention of genf ) . 
  you are wrong . 
   refugees and stateless persons may be able to apply after 6 years of continual residency asylum seekers have the same opportunity of becoming german citizens like any other foreign person living in germany for a certain amount of years . 
  in fact , the requirements for a refugee are even lower ( they do not need to be able to prove capabilities of spaking german at the same level as regular applicants for example ) . 
  the time they spend here while their asylum request is being processed will be fully credited for the residency time requirement . 
  * faster processing of the asylum requests . 
  instead of checking each syrian case , we should go over to accepting them if they can prove that they hold syrian citizenship , we accept 99,5 % anyways . 
  * copy the system of switzerland and norway when dealing with people form countries that dont qualify them for asylum , like kosovo . 
  that means dealing with them within 48 hours and deport them afterwards . 
  * suspend laws that hinder the construction of buildings for refugees . 
  we face serious problems because they need to take a lengthy way of approval form the authorities while they are also becoming too expensive to build as environmental laws apply ( like expensive , energy-saving glass ) * give the people with good chances for getting asylum better and faster access to language courses . 
  currently it can take a lot of time until you are granted german lessons , time that is essentially wasted . 
  the longer we wait , the longer it will take until these people can actively contribute to our economy and society . 
  i 'd like to see the outdated pcs of our authorities ( which are usually sold for little money usually ) get equipped with language learning software and placed in the asylum homes . 
  to name a few . 
  investing in countries where corruption is prevalent is not exactly a smart move . 
  dont forget that the lions share of our economy consists of small and medium-sized enterprises , most of them have neither the will nor the means to move factories abroad . 
  anecdotal experience does not count . 
  especially considering that these 71 people likely got advice from the same people . 
  this does not prove the claim that `` nobody has an id '' . 
  i think you are misinterpreting the asylum laws . 
  after staying here for six years , these people are free to apply for citizenship ( at least here in germany ) . 
  given that the war might very well go on for that long , we have a clear perspective for these people to stay here legally . 
  edit : i like how i am being downvoted for reciting the legal requirements of gaining citizenship . 
  nope .
