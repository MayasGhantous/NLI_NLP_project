  currencies do not belong into this discussion . 
   elaborate cases where companies sue for `` lost profits '' are the exception , not the common case . 
  there also is no direct connection between `` decisions that affect their profits '' and compensation . 
  governments maintain the right to regulate . 
  the main reson for isds claims is that governments break their promises or discriminate in favor of domestic companies . 
   elaborate both ttip and ceta have specific clauses protecting the national health systems from being affected by these treaties . 
  same goes for a variety of other issues . 
   elaborate we have no indication that a significant amount of standards is in fact lowered so far . 
  take your time . 
  we have no reasons to rush . 
  but we already had several comments in this game indicating that most people have n't got any clues of the reality of ttip . 
  quite a common sight considering this topic . 
   it will prevent better environmental protection it wo n't . 
   it will give them a way to sue countries in secret supernational courts on the basis of projected profits wrong . 
   therfore it will seriously hinder anything that could prevent cooperations from making money wrong . 
   imagen we learn that some previously thought to be harmless waste is toxic . 
  countries want to prevent cooperations to dump that waste in the environment . 
  with ttip even before said legislation could be implemented , cooperations could intervene and even if said legislation would be implemented , cooperations could sue on the basis of profits lost due to better more safe standards . 
  even more wrong . 
   and by the way , these promised gains are vague and if you look into other trade deals , you wo n't find much good that came out of them . 
  source ? 
   except for large corporations . 
  you know that it is mainly small - and medium sized corporations who benefit from lower trade barriers ? 
  large cooperations can establish manufacturing in other countries without problems . 
  it is not financially troubling for them to develop products multiple times to match multiple safety standards . 
  for small companies , it is . 
   it allows corporations to sue governments for decisions that affect their profits inaccurate . 
   it allows the privatisation of our far superior social healthcare services inaccurate . 
   it lowers product standards so us businesses can compete with eu businesses , which is the complete opposite of how the situation should be . 
  inaccurate . 
  it is kind of funny that we talk about the electorate being misinformed in the brexit decision when it is at least equally worse in the ttip/ceta discussion . 
  but not for us . 
  canada is making fuel out of tar sand no matter what . 
  i am very much aware of what ceta is . 
  yes , the negotiations are finished and we will at some point vote on it . 
  this however is not an expalanation why it is is bad . 
  i want to hear your specific points of criticism . 
  saying `` its bad because its like ttip '' is not an argument . 
  the tar sand legislation is already put in place - ceta is n't . 
  also : this is not really * that * much of a significant problem for us . 
  this is not how anything of this works . 
   if the negociation were open we would have an open discussion and could decide to be against or in favor . 
  you can do that once it is negotiated . 
  there is little benefit in constant public debate on these issues . 
  negotiations take long enough as it is . 
  well , elaborate what your problem with ceta is please . 
  and please , for gods sake , go beyond `` ceta is bad mkay ? 
   ceta is still a problem though . 
  mind to elaborate ? 
   if you ca n't sell the innards of any deal to the general public and want to push past it with minimal time for reading , then you should re-consider your approach . 
  just because it is a common approach does n't make it the right approach . 
  lessons of the past when it comes to the success of open-door v. closed-door negotiations speak volumes though . 
   plus , you never adressed the issue that most eu/us trade barriers are already very low so the incremental benefits are extremely minor . 
  not really . 
   most of the ttip was , as i said , just lowering eu standards ( labour laws , environmental laws , food safety laws etc ) for us corporations . 
  there is little to no evidence for that in the leaks . 
  [ something to read for you ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) - no such thing as an invite . 
  these `` grown men disguising themselves as thirteen year olds '' have been regularly debunked . 
  i simply get sick of completely wrong claims . 
  and 80 % is a wrong claim . 
  i think we have a bit of a misunderstanding here . 
  when i say `` voluntarily '' i mean that they were asked to leave and subsequently left . 
  i want to differentiate it from actual deportations . 
  there is a difference between leaving despite wanting to stay and being outright reported ( aka police comes , puts you on a plane and kicks you out in your home country ) . 
  i have no delusions - of course many people wanted to stay , yet most of your people were not deported . 
  i really do not understand what you are onto here . 
  someone posted an incorrect claim , i successfully contested that claim with neutral numbers . 
  i have posted all numbers so everyone can check back on the calculations . 
  only you seem to have some kind of problem with it . 
  god knows why . 
  your sources actually support my point . 
   http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/13/071/1307111.asc point 11 clearly shows that between 10/96 and 02/97 , 60 people were deported . 
  in reality , almost 100,000 people left germany between '96 and ' 97 . 
   https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1998/07/bos-j16.html?view=print does not support the notion of mass deportations . 
  are you seriously suggesting that people aged 35-64 qualify as `` young '' ? 
  i have made very clear ( even in the post above ) which age groups i am talking about . 
  at no point , i have been unclear on my claims . 
  apart from that - people aged 35 and older are much more likely to be married already . 
  mine dates back to march 1995 while ops map seems to draw data from a later point . 
  between our two sources , 80,000 more people arrived , it is very possible that this shifted the numbers a bit . 
  * however * , there is a significant disconnect between the two : it says that the dutch took in 6 % - this however would mean 44,100 people and not 2,600 as in the map . 
  i tried to find some original sources , but i could n't find them . 
  the 199x area was n't that internet-savy yet . 
  we did n't . 
  most of them left on their own . 
  we gave them money to encourage them to leave though ( which is fine in my opinion ) . 
   340000 , that many refugees came to germany last year in september alone incorrect . 
  we had a peak of slightly above 10,000 people on a few days . 
  this alone makes it mathematically impossible to have 340,000 people within one month . 
  the easy system ( program to organize the distribution of refugeees inside germany before the actual application process ) registered 160,000 arrivals in september . 
   except of the germans noone else has forgotten collogne . 
  this ... is completely irrelevant as long as we do n't see more cases of similar actions ? 
  eurostat . 
  since you ca n't link to direct calculations , [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-datasets/-/migr_asyappctza ) is the general link ( click on `` view table '' ) . 
  here are the relevant numbers : * 1,321,600 total applications in 2015 * 953,470 males ( 72.1 % ) * 140,300 males aged 0-14 ( 10.6 % ) * 104,252 males aged 14-17 ( 7.9 % ) * 548,265 males aged 18-34 ( 41.5 % ) * 155,925 males aged 35-64 ( 11.8 % ) * 3,640 males aged 65 + ( 0,3 % ), 
  can you please stop spreading that `` they are all young men '' bullshit ? 
  yes , young men represent a significant share . 
  but no , they do not make up 80 % of the refugees . 
  the actual share of men aged 18-34 is 41.5 % . 
  and even if you say `` they all lie and say they are underage '' - even then you do not hit 50 % of the refugees ( you get roughly 49.5 % males aged 14-34 ) .
