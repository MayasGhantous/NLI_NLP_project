  i think this perception is more frequent in quite a few countries ( including hungary ) than in the uk . 
   well , you can not , i can not , a mafia expert might just do it  well , i can do it aswell . 
  i just have less credibility when doing so . 
  and despite his background , i still think he 's wrong . 
   every day corruption is frustrating ( i speak from experience ) but the big corruption will have a macro impact . 
  but not an impact on the population . 
  which i consider much more important . 
  let 's say an english bank funnels money from a russian businessman towards a drug cartel in mexico . 
  for the average british person * nothing * will change . 
  yet in the mind of this person , it makes britain `` a corrupt country '' . 
  the thing is : corruption is n't measured based on the perception of the local populace without reason . 
  if the average person does not really experience corruption or sees it as an issue in the country , you can not really call it ` the most corrupt country in the world ' . 
  it is very much possible to raise awareness on this issue without using this kind of dramatic and , in my opinion , unfitting term . 
  every-day corruption affecting the average citizen is much more significant than some money laundering and circumventing sanctions in my opinion . 
  even if the dimensions are enormeous , as claimed here . 
  already banned in germany - 25 $ fine . 
  it 's still a very clickbaity headline . 
  or expression for that matter . 
  well , `` thursday '' as in `` thursday three weeks ago '' . 
  i was just adressing the topic of dams . 
  there is no point in building dams if you have n't got any water in the area . 
   do n't the reichsb\u00fcrger believe that the second reich ( the kaiserreich ) is the last legitimate authority and not the third reich ? 
  well , it is a bit hard to differentiate between the iterations of the reich as they all share the same name . 
  there are different groups , some believe in the territories of 1937 , some in the territories of 1914 . 
  as i said in a different comment , there are dozens of different movements . 
   my girlfriend 's stepdad has decided to join these folks . 
  i am sorry . 
  yay i guess ? 
   jobless claims have fallen for two consecutive months , to their lowest in more than a year . 
  about a month ago , there was an article claiming that the jobless rate in france is actually decreasing because people stop searching for a job , not because they got one . 
  i hope this is not the case here . 
  no , it 's just heavy rain . 
  this location is far away from any sea or lake . 
  so far , their dealing with and the monitoring of the reichsb\u00fcrger has n't been problematic . 
   man , i am disappointed . 
  that looked very plain , which is sad , because they seemed pretty funny/eccentric . 
  it is quite a serious issue for these people . 
  but it seems they could not afford a proper designer . 
   ca n't say i envy the bnd . 
  it 's the [ federal office for the protection of the constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_office_for_the_protection_of_the_constitution ) actually ( in english that sounds quite a lot like the revolutionary guard in iran ) . 
  well , in the most part it is just an annoyance - compared to other countries we are well off with our nutjobs , agreed ( even though there were some incidents involving violence ) . 
  and well , they do have some outfits , but quite unfortunately they are horrible - [ their `` police '' ] ( http://www.pnn.de/fm/61/thumbnails/heprodimagesfotos93220130301dphw01.jpg.5453589.jpg ) . 
  members of this `` police corps '' recieved sentences between 10 and 30 months jail time . 
  there were even attempts of creating a `` military '' - this would be genuinely worrisome , honestly . 
  it is bad enough as it is , we do not need paramilitary units . 
  should this be attempted however , they will face much harsher sentences . 
  and , fortunately , they are being monitored by our government agencies . 
  it creates the most absurd scenarios . 
  these guys actually have a ` government ' , ` diplomats ' and ` policemen ' . 
  it does n't come surprising that they regularly have troubles with the authorities . 
  some of them showed some [ `` driving license of the reich '' ] ( http://www.kleinezeitung.at/images/uploads/9/d/b/3942875/7625dc9c-1cf4-496c-9290-823fb85541dc.jpg ) in traffic control and they will even sell you `` legitimate documents '' like an [ id ] ( http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/media/thumbs/a/a971967fd2f72035835dbedb8fa0cc03v1_max_755x424_b3535db83dc50e27c1bb1392364c95a2.jpg ) for around 20 $ . 
  since this is still germany , it is also bureaucratic : [ application form for a `` german driving license '' ] ( http://deutsche-reichsdruckerei.de/dokumente/fahrerlaubnis/rfe-antrag-kdr.pdf ) i think the most ridiculous case i have heared in this regard was an elderly man who was ordered to appear in front of a ( regular ) court . 
  he did n't show up but wrote a letter that he was `` dead '' and that `` he , as a legal entity , ceased to exist '' . 
  he also claimed that the court had no legal authority since `` the allied powers abolished all positions of the civil servants in 1945 '' and that `` the federal republic ceased to exist in 1990 '' ( and was succeeded by the reich i assume ) . 
  and there 's more - it is not a unified movement but dozens of them , each with own representants , ids and `` citizens '' . 
  these people seriously burden our judiciary since they send in papers worth dozens of pages explaining why the federal republic does not exist . 
  some of them even claim that they have `` obtained souvereign statehood as a person '' . 
  the problem is that we ca n't even prosecute most of them - the majority of them is objectively insane . 
  if they are obviously * not * sticking to their program i think this is the wrong approach . 
  i did n't know about the situation in non-western countries , therefore i didnt want to make the ` global ' claim . 
  i am of course aware that the us is a prime example of a written constitution . 
   she simply stated that border police has the right to use lethal force to enforce border control which is legally incorrect . 
   afd has said they want an immigration model like canada and welcome actual refugees , even muslims . 
  if you judge the afd by the party program , you are right . 
  if you judge them based on their personnel and the things said by their representants - you see a clear shift to the ( far ) right . 
  he made some remarks in the past that can be interpreted as him supporting the `` reichsb\u00fcrger '' ( citizens of the reich ) - a group of people who believe that the `` reich '' never ceased to exist and that the federal republic of germany is a firm called `` deutschland gmbh '' ( `` germany llc '' ) with no authority to run the german territories . 
  many of them also believe that the former eastern territories are still german . 
  in general - some far right nutjobs , most of which are unemployed and they are causing a real mess for our judicial system . 
   i dont have that infograph right now even without seeing it i can assure you that it does n't reflect reality . 
  yes , of course . 
  it is also problematic with parliamentary supremacy . 
  this can easily be confused in a google search . 
  oh , do n't get me wrong - it is not what i expect from the average greek concerning the average german . 
  every person i know who went to greece had a blast and was treated very nicely . 
  but real life opinion is one thing and google search quite another one . 
  especially since government opinion can easily be projected on the country as a whole . 
  -- -- -- i think the two `` best '' results for `` greece is ... '' in german google show why google is not representative : 1 . 
  `` greece is bankrupt '' 2 . 
  `` greece is not bankrupt we are being cheated '' i mean - what the hell ? 
  yes , but this is not the norm inside the eu . 
  i honestly expected terrible things for us . 
   anyway there is no chance of the uk joining so it 's a moot point . 
  true . 
  even in the very pro-federal countries it wo n't happen in the forseeable future . 
  i think we can argue about this forever . 
  what matters is the second paragraph in my comment above - it would be a significant change for the uk . 
  no matter how it is called . 
  as i said , it depends on your definition of `` constitution '' . 
  you can define it as some kind of basic ruleset for the functioning of the state - in this case the uk has a constitution . 
  but if you stick to the definition of a constitution in the sense of a single document that includes the relevant things , the uk does n't have one . 
  what is relevant here is that a federal european constitution would be fundamentally different from what you have got right now as we continentals are keen on having it codified in a single document . 
  not in the sense of a continental `` constitution '' . 
  there is n't a single document that could be called `` the constitution of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' . 
  or to a constitution at all . 
  especially the british have a vastly different history and mindset in this area . 
  well , somewhat . 
  the video above was produced in 1944 , leaving little time to produce more films as the war was over very soon afterwards . 
  [ know your enemy : japan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbifnpyk4rw ) [ here is germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nixdoc3pk1i ) ( occupation preparation ) [ list of allied propaganda films in ww2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_allied_propaganda_films_of_world_war_ii ) - you can find many of them through a name search on youtube . 
   i was also thinking of using referenda over treaties , like denmark or ireland . 
  by far not as powerful .
