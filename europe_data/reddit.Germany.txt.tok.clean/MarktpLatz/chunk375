  however none of their projects alone led to the current day computers . 
  it 's not about believing , it is about the fact that both negotiating teams are not stupid .

   i 'm asking you to read every word in this wikipedia page and tell me why we should n't view germany with suspicion . 
  because germany is the one country in the world that stands by its past . 
  contrary to countries like japan or russia , we are not ignoring or glorifying what we did in the past - quite the contrary . 
  the whole concept of our country has been an answer to the flaws of the weimar republic , which enabled the third reich , and nazi germany itself . 
  our country is n't filled with memorials for our `` victorious and strong soldiers '' , it is filled with memorials for the dead , it is filled with memorials and museums about the atrocities we committed . 
   i honestly could n't care less that 's it 's a new generation . 
  that 's the main reason however . 
  nobody can ask you to forgive the people that were involved in this or tolerated this . 
  however , it is not one generation that has passed , it is several generations and the current generations neither had anything to do with it , nor do they want to have to do anything with it . 
  the current generations are as disgusted by what happened as anyone else . 
  well , we already have a giant megathread about the election and literally the top post on the front page is encouraging dutch people to vote .

  i did n't censor anyone . 
  he deleted that post himself without me asking him to do so . 
  not everything is a conspiracy . 
  i am very sorry mate , but we do not allow self-promoting of own videos . 
  he devoted several paragraphs to calling me a troll ( comment is deleted now ) and he did n't recieve a ban for it . 
  so what is your point ? 
  you could n't make a headline like this up ... 
  and those are valid concerns . 
  but again , i believe what we need to do is educate and integrate , not ban things . 
  it is n't the people who got to wealth whose children are getting more religious , it is those that live in poverty , due to lack of education or through social disadvantages . 
  translation :  we assume that it does n't do the complexity of the topic any justice to claim that the hijab is simply a tool for the suppression of women . 
  obviously , many muslim women in germany decide to wear a hijab voluntarily out of various motives . 
  these motives are widely unknown . 
  it is the point of this study to find out about those reasons as well as about the polticial and social views of these women . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_9095-544-1-30.pdf ), 
  this does n't mean that you can transfer this judgement to other european countries . 
  it is n't . 
  i am genuinely open to discussion here . 
  but people accusing me of `` being payed '' or simply insisiting on maintaining generalized statements is n't really the way to go . 
  let me sum up my position on this whole issue because i think you may have misunderstood me ( quoting another comment of mine ) :  to sum it up : i do not have a problem with this judgement . 
  i disagree with general bans on the hijab because it is n't always forced upon the women who wear it . 
  i disagree with general statements painting this as a black-and-white decision . 
  i would prefer it if people would wear whatever they want , and not what their religion , their religious leaders or their parents tell them to wear . 
  for conservative muslims however , a general ban could do more harm than good in my opinion as it would take an option to go into the public away from some people ( who would stay home as an alternative ) . 
  i disagree with mixing hijab and niqab/burqa in this discussion because the public opposition to the latter is much more significant . 
  i have already written to you in the other reply . 
  i hope this clears things up , i think you are simply misunderstanding me . 
  then you should read more carefully what i am writing . 
  look at the various commnents of mine in this thread and you will see ( i think ) that you have a wrong take on my opinion . 
  to sum it up : i do not have a problem with this judgement . 
  i disagree with general bans on the hijab because it is n't always forced upon the women who wear it . 
  i disagree with general statements painting this as a black-and-white decision . 
  i would prefer it if people would wear whatever they want , and not what their religion , their religious leaders or their parents tell them to wear . 
  for conservative muslims however , a general ban could do more harm than good in my opinion as it would take an option to go into the public away from some people ( who would stay home as an alternative ) . 
  i disagree with mixing hijab and niqab/burqa in this discussion because the public opposition to the latter is much more significant . 
  i do not have any statistic on who wears it by choice and who wears it because they are forced to wear it ( this would be kind of hard to measure ) . 
  but i * do * have data that tells me that 70 % of muslims in germany ( 2009 ) do * not * wear a hijab and the share of hijab-wearing women is lower in the second generation . 
  honestly , i am not acting in bad faith here . 
  i have been talking about european countries the whole time . 
  the reality in the arab world is different , but this is n't the subject here . 
  and yes , i am aware that some of these problems are essentially `` imported '' to our countries , but it is n't just to make blanket statements like this . 
  you are missing the point . 
  i have no problems with the judgement itself . 
  that 's only for italy however . 
  the judgement is a specific decision with the focus on italy . 
  it was n't a general declaration for europe . 
  i am talking about a general ban however . 
  i do not have a problem with this ruling . 
  yeah . 
  which is my whole problem . 
  people think i am defending islam or whatever when my point was for the whole time that i oppose simplified generalizations . 
  yeah , but i disagree with a ban on the hijab in all honesty . 
  punish it harder if they force their children do wear it , whatever . 
  but i am opposed to a general ban . 
   it 's not a tool for liberation . 
  they feel better when they are covered because they are sexually and socially oppressed . 
  they are taught those social rules and dress code since the first years of their life , and no amount of education will change that . 
  because the ones who enforce those rules do n't want it to change . 
  many people * have * walked away from these norms however . 
  you do not achieve enlightenment with bans , you achieve it through eduaction . 
  if we do not believe in education anymore , we have failed . 
  and tolerance very much is an european value . 
  i disagree politely , but if you think there are similatirites in how we sound , so be it . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/i-created-the-burkini-to-give-women-freedom-not-to-take-it-away ) covers a bit of what i am saying . 
  again , i do not think that hijab/burqini/whatever are an optimal solution . 
  i would prefer it if people did not chose to believe in gods that somehow care about their dresses or hair , if everyone chose their clothing based on whether they like it or not . 
  but i still maintain that a hijab in public is better than open hair and not leaving their home . 
  that 's your own choice that you were always free to make . 
  you can not grasp the concept that someone might have a dissenting opinion ? 
  i am not . 
  i simply do not believe that a general ban is a good way to go . 
  i am opposed to a culture forcing headwear on their daughters as much as you . 
  i simply believe that banning the hijab will not fix that . 
  i believe that it needs to be fixed with education and , if possible , integration . 
  the way to fix this is education however , not a general ban .
