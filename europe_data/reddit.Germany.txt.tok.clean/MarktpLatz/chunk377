  you have been warned before , you will face a major ban the next time . 
  as i said , i have no problem with violence ( from official forces ) if it is the last possible way to act . 
  still nothing one should take pride in . 
  it would be preferable if there was a way to resolve the dispute peacefully . 
  no worries, 
  reddit admins have a way to completely suspend or delete accounts - we ( normal mods ) can only ban users from our subreddit . 
  this can either happen if they detect that an account is ban evading or if the account is reported to them . 
  it is n't :  earth 's oceans are warming 13 % faster than thought , and accelerating  europes oceans are warming 13 % faster than originally thought, 
  that 's nonsense . 
  why would we do that ? 
  and how ? 
   of course it is and sadly we ca n't entirely . 
  but we can plan our economic relations so that we stand far away enough that the blast from the time bomb of libertarianism so that what we 'll feel is only a little wind and wo n't rip us apart like it did in other european countries in 2008 . 
  unlikely . 
  we are - even without a trade agreement - already vastly interconnected with the us . 
  any suggestion that we could `` stand far enough away '' is n't really realistic . 
  i guess so ?

  beating people is never good . 
  it might be a necessary evil , but it is nothing to be proud of . 
  this is n't to say that the other side is n't to blame for this . 
   i was n't talking about deregulation , i was talking about deepening already deep ties to an unstable economy with a history of causing mayhem for those interact with it 's deregulated industries to much . 
  the whole world is interconnected . 
  this way , we can at least profit until this happens again . 
  we can not wall ourselves off the us . 
   and then pay companies for losses of profits . 
  that 's a phenomen that is n't american . 
  i disagree . 
  we are not some kind of third world camp in the area . 
  yup even then . 
  at least if there is no obvious reason to do so .

  his account has already been deleted by reddit as it looks ... 
  please use / r/askeurope for questions of this kind . 
   i think deepening trade relations with an economy already as deregulated as the us is like putting a gun to your head and tying a rope to the trigger . 
  not really , no . 
  the us is one of our biggest trade partners already ( it even used to be the largest quite recently ) , yet pretty much all of the deregulation happened due to internal pressure and politics . 
   and then there 's the americanisation of health and safety standards ... 
  which is why the relevant trade agreements include wide-ranging clauses preserving the right of the respective governments to regulate in these areas without outside influence . 
   even so you can not campaign for years and years on the promise of simplifying the tax code and lowering taxes for the middle classes and then give the only tax break to the wealthy regardless of whether or not it makes economic sense . 
  that 's accurate . 
  but we have to keep in mind that the fdp is a much older party and that pretty much nobody that was in charge back then is in charge right now . 
   just like how in the uk the liberal democracts killed themselves by fucking over the students on their main election pledge not to increase tuition fees the fdp was measured by most voters on their pledges regarding taxes . 
  and in said publics perception they failed miserably . 
  if they are not even good for that and cant keep their main promise why should anybody vote for them ? 
  well , if we are fair we have to say that without the libdems , the increase would have been higher , but i get where you are coming from . 
   and to the people saying they were the minority power in the coalition . 
  yes exactly - without them merkel would have had no governing power other than another grand coalition . 
  they should have either used that leverage or said no to the coalition . 
  however , they were greedy and wanted a seat at the table but betrayed many of their voters . 
  that 's a bit simplified . 
  you can not seriously threaten to break up the coalition over this . 
   ? so , you are saying that poland should vote for tusk even if he clearly using his position to take part in polish political conflict against polish government ? 
  there is a difference between tusk acting as an eu official against the polish government ( and pretty much all of the eu has been critical of the changes to the constitutional court ) and him acting as a de facto opposition leader ( which he does n't ) . 
  his nationality does n't mean that he ca n't say anything against the polish government . 
   our gov could n't vote for tusk , it 's a matter of honor and dignity well , that 's outright bullshit . 
   maybe you in western eu replaced those walues with tolerance for everything and procrastination with solving critical problems . 
  well , we did n't . 
  hahahaha . 
   and having them form ghettos in our cities where they do the same thing is better how ? 
  that 's why we have recently changed policy in this regard . 
  we try spread those that are on benefits out . 
  to ensure integration , we can force them to live in certain places . 
  we should put more emphasis on this . 
   how many migrants have practically vanished ? 
  hard to say . 
   a refugee camp with clearly defined borders with a big police/military presences sounds like a better solution to me , no ? 
  not as a long-term solution ( in terms of several years ) . 
   refugees are supposed to go back where they came from after the conflict ended . 
  they are not supposed to make a home where they flee to . 
  you can not pretend that things happen in a vacuum however . 
  if you put large amounts of people into camps wihout any perspective , you will breed radicalism and crime . 
   so is uncontrolled immigration and being having your foreign policy dicated by a fascist dictator wanna-be . 
  that 's another topic which has nothing to do with the decision what to do with them here . 
  we 're open to good discussion , but this unfortunately did n't fulfill the criteria , sorry :p, 
  while i oppose imposing this kind of sanctions on poland , you can not really call it a `` right to block policy '' as if that was somehow justified . 
  their veto is n't meant to be handled this way . 
  this is just a dickish move . 
  the vote was `` who wants tusk ? '' .
