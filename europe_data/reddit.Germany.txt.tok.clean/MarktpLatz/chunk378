  and i see no reason why they wo n't vote for him , he did a good job so far . 
  as for the other v4 nations - they are well aware that tusk is their best bet , a potential replacement would have come from another region of europe . 
  that 's why those areas are covered by `` right to regulate '' provisions in ceta ( and likely ttip ) , duh . 
  you are aware that in many countries , financial independence from government benefits is a direct requirement ? 
  you can not fulfill that in a camp . 
  and no , stuffing people into camps for years , without prospects of employment is a guaranteed recipe for disaster .

  nobody is willing to agree on a quota system . 
  and you are wrong , for many there is no way to send them back on an airplane ( mainly syrians ) - what do you do about them ? 
  switzerland also is way superior to other countries in preparing its citizens for the votes . 
  in other countries , you rely on the media and public statements and then you go and vote . 
  in switzerland , they send you a little leaflet containing the most relevant positions of various actors on this , the full law text and some background info prior to the vote . 
  bad idea . 
  doing this in a country like greece would be horrible . 
  mainly because of the local unemployment problems . 
  you can not put people into camps for years and years without any prospects whatsoever . 
  the australians have nations that cooperate with them in exchange for a shitload of money . 
  as soon as people are on a greek island , it will be kind of impossible to return them to turkey without turkeys approval . 
  not even talking about the human rights concerns in regards to australia and the fact that their arrival numbers never were remotely close to the arrivals in greece . 
  you know well enough that this is n't possible . 
  there is a difference between guarding a land border and guarding a sea border and thousands of islands .

   i give myself 15-30 minutes before this post is deleted and i 'm banned why should we do that ? 
  nah , this would go nowhere . 
  seriously . 
  well , i would appreciate it if you could tell me why you think it might be bad/problematic so i can point out to you where you are wrong . 
  can we stop with this ? 
  lowering the taxes for hotels was deemed the correct move by several parties , it was n't just the fdp . 
  after the public backlash , the fdp even wanted to reverse it , but merkel said no . 
  the main driving force behind this was the csu anyways . 
  it 's not really about their views , it is about their recent history . 
  they have lost a lot of credibility during their last period in the government . 
  september 24th . 
  it 's still a long time to go . 
  merkel herself has n't even started campaigning in public . 
  for a macron victory : it depends . 
  his victory alone wo n't boost schulz . 
  it depends on what he does and what the consequences are . 
  i agree with the first part of what you said , but not with the last paragraph  if someone irresponsible would make a referendum asking people if they still want to pay taxes or not , most people will say '' no '' . 
  unlikely . 
  people are stupid , but not * that * stupid . 
   if people from some countries would be asked if they want all the migrants ( legal or not ) to be deported right away , in some cases that may pass and lead to a very abusive behaviour towards foreigners and increase the xenophobia . 
  depends . 
  if we would ever introduce public referenda in germany , these would be bound by the fundamental laws as well . 
  the most likely process of this kind is that our constitutional court would determine whether the voting options are constitutional in advance , which would kill off these possibilities . 
   there are countries in which the parliament has under 10-20 % credibility . 
  for example , in countries with a lot of corruption and political incompetence . 
  if a referendum would be made at the right time ( anger towards the political class because of some emotional event ) and ask whether the parliament should be banned or their numbers reduced to something insignificant , cause they are just consuming tax payer money for nothing productive , it may very well pass . 
  etc , etc , etc. 
  again , see above answer . 
  i do not believe that your points are necessarily connected with direct democracy , there are ways to circumvent these problems . 
  nevertheless , i am opposed to public referendums on a federal level here . 
  the countries north of greece have closed their borders , not really about greece in this regard . 
  feel free to make a longer coherent post containing your answers then and i 'll try to answer your questions . 
  i 'm not at home at the moment , but sending me yet another reply every few hours is a bit problematic for my inbox to be honest . 
  yeah , but why do you keep coming back to me every few hours ? 
  i really do n't understand what you are on about . 
  you do realize that erdogan would fuck greece by this , not germany ? 
  erdogans threats ca n't be taken serious anymore , he has overdone it . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
   thats why lucke had to leave and the afd drifted further to the right . 
  that 's not really accurate . 
  we consider them what they are - insane atrocities committed by many of our forefathers following an ideology of hate . 
  while we ourselves are not responsible for these things ( the last people serving in ww2 are currently dying ) , we made it our task to ensure that this can never happen again and that these crimes are not forgotten . 
  as i have outlined elsewhere , 2015 was an unusual year for russia , marked by an overly large increase in spending . 
  it has been around 4 % for the years prior to that and i expect it to return to 4 % in the near future . 
  well , hopefully . 
  i totally agree with you , but even the threat is less significant than it was during the cold war , fortunately . 
   france and the uk short of munitions in libya there is a difference between running out of ammo and not having ammo in the first place . 
  well , feel free to prove me wrong . 
  oh do n't get me wrong . 
  i agree with you . 
  gdp is a shitty measure and that 's also why i dislike the fixation on 2 % . 
   but that 's argument in favor of what ?
