   while i have no problem with the rule , i do n't think he meant denial of it happening but about things like the scale of it etc. 
  not the existence of it but the details of it . 
  given his other posts , i doubt that . 
   that 's the `` disputed '' things i 've seen online anyway . 
  i 've never seen anyone claim it simply did n't happen . 
  they usually seem to think that numbers etc. 
  are exaggerated . 
  that just means that we ( the mods ) are doing a good job honestly . 
  if you saw this thread including the removed comments , you would start thinking otherwise . 
  we had some severe issues with this recently . 
  they do n't really have another option when their ban is permanent , 
  now , that might be true . 
  these numbers are n't even remotely accurate . 
  both of them are above the range of suspected victims . 
  official numbers vary between 5.6 and 6.3 millions . 
  disputing the holocaust is n't an `` unpleasant opinion '' , it simply is factually wrong . 
  has actually nothing to do with my nationality .

  nobody that has any legitimacy is disagreeing that the holocaust happened . 
  we had way too many of those in this thread . 
  this is n't funny anymore . 
  you wo n't get banned for it , but we will remove comments of this kind . 
  that 's impossible because there are too many factors involved . 
  we do not know the situation in palestine would have evolved without ww2 . 
  yeah . 
  we have issued more bans in this thread alone within four hours than we usually issue within a few days . 
  yes . 
  look at the rules :  racism , bigotry and other offensive content : includes but is not limited to : hate speech , genocide denial ( holocaust , armenian genocide , holodomor , etc ) , homophobia , endorsement of violence or other criminal activity . 
  there 's nothing to discuss about it . 
  it is an undisputed event that took place and denying it is a crime in several countries . 
  we have generally banned genocide denial on this sub . 
  alright , since this post made it to / r/all , here is a quick note from the mod team : holocaust denial and antisemitism are n't allowed here . 
  we are ready to swing the hammer and we wo n't be generous in this regard .

  this is not relevant as this is n't regular migration . 
  those who do n't get a job wo n't be able to get german citizenship and will have to go back as soon as its safe . 
  well , it is an argument - it has n't led to mass abuse of the system in the past . 
  assuming that we are able to protect the outsider borders of the schengen area , a change is n't necessary . 
  yeah , to me some time to find it in the first place too : x, 
  that 's the legal situation . 
  it has always been this way .

  report 2015 , page 5, 
   you claimed that they cover the coosts with the taxes that they pay . 
  this is untrue . 
  where did i say that ? 
  i said `` and '' , not `` exclusively by '' . 
   some agree that it 's unsustainabe just do the maths . 
  assuming they study for five years and do a master , that would be around 65,000 $ . 
  if you say that only half of them stay , that 's 130,000 $ per person . 
  that 's not an amount of money that ca n't be made up by the taxes such a person pays here over several years . 
  there is literally no issue whatsoever if integrated people who are in work stay here . 
  if either of these two conditions does n't apply , that 's where it gets tougher , but the chances of these people being allowed to stay here are much lower anyways . 
  out of those who graduate , 44 % stay in germany . 
  the biggest problem we are facing are two things : first of all , too many foreigners do n't finish their studies ( 41 % of foreigners do n't graduate while `` only '' 28 % of germans quit their studies ) . 
  secondly , it is apparently a bit complicated to stay here for some people . 
  80 % of foreign students say that they would like to stay here . 
  additionally , there is still the spending of these people over here , including vat etc. 
  there was another report a while back about how long people tend to stay here on average , but i can not find that right now . 
  it 's not absurd . 
  many of our companies are actually reliant on foreign graduates . 
  and by their taxes , to be precise . 
  a large portion of these students stays here and pays taxes here for several years . 
   do n't we have any elections in near future in germany ? 
  yes , september 24th . 
   do currently governing people know that allowing ` refugees ' without checking was a controversial idea that was not supported not only in germany but also in eu ? 
  at the point where the decision was made , it was n't a controversial idea whatsoever in germany . 
  there was 70 % + approval for opening the borders . 
   do population of germany needs easy and acceptable explanation of these decisions ? 
  just asking . 
  i do n't understand what you mean by this . 
  poland was in a better condition after he left office than it was before he took office . 
  you can disagree about political direction , but you can not say that he `` does n't respect poland '' . 
  you also ignore that wage growth can only in part be steered by politicians , most of it comes from the private sector .

  this is not related to this position in the eu . 
  mind to point out some examples ? 
  we support him because he is doing a great job at his position .
