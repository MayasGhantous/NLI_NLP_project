  this ... does n't indicate anything about him being a puppet ? 
  just because we support someone does n't mean that he is our puppet or a person of our grace .

   that makes about 2 % of total votes . 
  it could - but it wo n't . 
  the turnout in germany tends to be massively lower than in turkey . 
  the turnout in general was 85.18 % in the last election , it was 40.7 % in germany . 
  votes from germany made up about 1.2 % of the total votes . 
  that 's what i asked myself . 
  we are talking hundreds of thousands votes by the way - the akp recieved 340,000 votes from voters in germany in the last election . 
  criticism on turkish elections has mainly been targeted at the pre-election circumstances , mainly campaigning restrictions and media censorship . 
  despite all that , the last elections did n't go as well as erdogan would have liked . 
  so i do n't think that we will see russian conditions in this election .

   policies grouped under the term ` austerity measures ' may include spending cuts , tax increases , or a mixture of both , and may be undertaken to demonstrate the government 's fiscal discipline to creditors and credit rating agencies by bringing revenues closer to expenditures . 
  that 's what i was referencing . 
  we have n't done much in terms of actual spending cuts or tax hikes recently , we just `` simply '' did n't increase spending * as much * . 
  i find it difficult to describe our policies as `` austerity '' when we have the money to fund all kinds of pet projects while planning to reduce taxes despite running a balanced budget at the same time . 
  it just has a different connotation in my opinion .

  germany has n't applied that much austerity in recent years honestly . 
  no , and for good reason . 
  this statistic has met a lot of criticism in germany as well and the eu has a ( in my opinion ) better way of measuring `` poverty '' . 
  i disagree . 
  for this , we have statistics about the income gap and growing inequality . 
  this aims at something else . 
  you are completely ignoring my point . 
  your comparison is absolutely ridiculous . 
  we should n't be this high up ... 
  if this is accurate , i feel sorry for those that are below us because we are absolutely horrible in this regard . 
  it is a different concept of free speech . 
  both models have up - and downsides , but suggesting that `` free speech does n't exist in europe '' is ridiculous . 
  and no , your take on germany only tells me that you have no clue of the reality here . 
  that 's overly simplified . 
  especially in a globalized world and in times of automation , this is n't the case . 
  yes , the price levels would increase , but it is rather unlikely that there would be no gain . 
  i think so , too . 
  unfortunately , the [ last data for germany ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/material_deprivation_statistics_-_early_results ) is from 2015 ( not visible on that site , but it is if you access the raw data ) . 
  it could , but it likely does n't . 
  it 's just a shitty way to measure poverty . 
  if the income of everyone in germany doubled , the poverty rate according to this calculation would stay the same . 
  we do not allow surveys that have n't been approved by the mod team .
