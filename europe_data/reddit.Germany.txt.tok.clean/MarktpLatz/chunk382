  the blood is tested anyways before being redistributed . 
  in the current day , the chance of homosexual males having aids is higher than for heterosexuals ( iirc ) , but as far as i know the difference is marginal . 
  it 's a lot of fear and little science involved in that ban . 
  most of these bans originate from a time where homosexuality was still banned in many countries . 
  yeah , quite a lot of countries actually . 
   in all honesty that makes sense from within their framework . 
  if we work from the base that same-sex couples should n't raise children , then why should we give them tax-breaks ? 
  are n't those given so that the burden of raising children is lowered ? 
  ( all the prep-up included , which can sometimes backfire , if the couple never has children , but that depends on your government 's implementation of marital tax breaks ) no , it does n't . 
  it would make sense to do that if you would get tax breaks for getting children ( and i see nothing wrong with that ) , but since it also benefits all those that do n't have children , not giving these breaks to homosexual couples is discriminatory . 
  because if you do n't have children , it makes literally no difference what gender your partner is . 
   i do n't follow . 
  are people legit going `` oh , i want this specific thing , but not this purpose-wise identical thing , albeit different semantically '' ? 
  labelling these things into different categories makes a civil partnership seem like a second-class marriage , even if the legal effects are the same . 
  there is a difference between being able to say `` we 're married '' and `` we are in a civil partnership '' . 
  the latter one seems a lot less connected with love or whatever you connect with marriage . 
  it sounds like some bureaucratic agreement . 
  same in germany . 
  that 's supposed to be changed soon though . 
  ca n't talk about finland , but in germany , you can not adopt children if you are a homosexual couple . 
  until 2011 , you also did n't recieve the same tax breaks that married couples got . 
  and last but not least , it 's the problem that a civil partnership might be equal to marriage , but it * is n't * marriage .

  no worries , 
  i immediately reinstated it . 
  have a good day !, 
  uhm . 
  nothing speaks against her claim ? 
  you can very well be an american citizen and live somewhere else . 
  there is a difference between saying that it is a mental thing and saying that it is a mental disease . 
  and no , the fact that the different types of genitalia are meant to compliment each other is n't an indication that being homosexual is somehow any less natural . 
  homosexuality can be observed in a variety of species . 
  we do . 
  however , for whatever reason , most people in this thread that are opposed to it believe that it is some kind of mental disease .

  you should have a look how the old greek auto industry ended up . 
  there are good reasons not to do this in greece . 
  from a purely economical perspective , the eastern european countries are much better places for this . 
  it depends . 
  removed . 
  this is hardly neutral and given that you are a new account it seems rather agenda-pushy . 
  this is not up to you to decide . 
  you can expect a ban in this case . 
  we do not tolerate harassing . 
  if you have a problem with an article , simply downvote it or report it to us if it is breaking any rules . 
  yes , there are a lot of articles about brexit . 
  but no , we are far from the point where you could say that they are `` flooding '' the sub . 
  sorry , i have no issue debating this , but you would need a much better introduction for the discussion to have your post approved . 
  no worries,
