  we do not need 370,000 people to spend 2 % . 
  actually there is something wrong with it : it costs a lot of money and it is uncesseary . 
  why should germany , one of the most peaceful countries on earth , have a military bigger than france or the u.k. ? 
  relative to population size , 370,000 people are more than the us has right now if i 'm not mistaken . 
  1 . we have free and independent media , they broadcast whatever they want 2 . the only reason why this is made public is because it is a law change 3 . there is a difference between being granted asylum and applying for asylum . 
  this specific case was caused by a multitude of unfortunate events . 
  here 's the usual problem : austerity might not work brilliantly , but what is the alternative for countries like greece ? 
  they simply do n't have any money that they could use for stimulus . 
  they do not exploit our trust by doing so , however . 
  one might argue that they are exploiting a generous legal system , but those that are honest about their origin and flight reasons are n't exploiting our trust . 
  well , there is n't that much difference in terms of `` progressive values '' here . 
  it is about economics primarily . 
  paying unemployed people more is n't necessarily `` progressive '' . 
  and where are you/they going to take the money from ? 
  our constitution prevents any government from endebting the country . 
  there is some leeway , but that 's rather minor . 
  given the current surplus , there is a potential for maybe 15 bn . 
  additional annual spending and that does n't take into account that we are expecting a fiscal gap of around 8 bn . 
  for 2018 and that we are also attempting to increase military spending in the meanwhile . 
  repealing that provision in our constition would not have a sufficient majority and it was the spd which voted for its implementation in the first place .

  thank you !, 
  i do not contest the first part , but this is n't a valid argument why the eu would not fulfill the same function . 
  and concerning eastern europe - op mentioned the baltics and eastern europe . 
  most of eastern europe is part of the eu , bar ukraine and belarus . 
  and belarus is n't even remotely close to us , we have no obligations in this regard . 
  yes , i meant 42.7 i am sorry . 
  it is more powerful since it actually dictates military consequences , unlike art . 
  the limitation according to the national specifications does n't change this . 
  it does . 
  simply because ukraine is neither in a military nor in a political alliance with us . 
  art . 
  47.2 of the lisbon treaty is actually a lot more powerful than art . 
  5 of the nato-charta . 
  it could do that without spending over 2 % . 
  you spent money on hovercraft landing vessels from russia that have no possible operation scenario and on tanks from germany without ammunition in the past . 
  this is quite literally a waste of money . 
   i am happy at least that greece spends the agreed amount when it comes to defence . 
  you are taking pride in something that is n't working and based on a rivalry with turkey and a lot of corruption . 
  it is n't about spending a fixed amount of money as much as spending it where it is effective . 
  unlikely . 
  while not as large as the us , it is n't like the eu would have no defence capabilities whatsoever . 
  russia would n't attack ee or the baltic even without nato . 
  also , an eu without the us would naturally increase their spending . 
  sorry , i misread that . 
  europe is n't helpless without the us . 
  we rely somewhat heavily on the us for defence and intelligence , this is n't the case for most other issues . 
  that 's not said . 
  repost it with the actual title please . 
   first of all the ceta has been validated by the european parliament , in spite of the opposition of more than 4 millions of europeans citizens . 
  they made a petition , asking for a referendum , but the parliament did not worry about it because in the european treaties , it is only written that you can make petitions for a cause , and not against . 
  4 million citizens is less than 1 % of the population of the eu , significantly less than the share of citizens most eu countries require to start a popular referendum . 
  additionally , the motion was directed at ceta * and * ttip and the procedure of collecting these signatures was dubious at best - it does n't include a way to actually confirm these entries . 
  additionally , it is n't a topic the general populace has good knowledge on and therefore they should not have a vote on it . 
   ceta is not made to improve environmental conditions nor social conditions , it actually made the opposite . 
  you ca n't impose your products if they are n't cheaper , and that means that some people , some companies will save money over these social and environmental conditions , not caring about how people and nature will be treated . 
  causing pollution and people being underpaid in canada . 
  that 's not entirely accurate . 
  of cource ceta was n't meant to increase these standards , but it has been designed with the aim of not lowering our standards in mind . 
   in france we will lose a lot of `` appellations d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e '' , a label which certifies the source and the quality of a product . 
  i saw some mocking comments about cheese , saying that `` we do n't want to share our cheese '' , etc. 
  but you know , that 's kind of true , by losing our labels , we will the - in the case of cheese - see a lots of new products that has of cheese only the name , because they will be produced in order to make money , not to make quality products . 
  and it is the same thing for the other products by the way . 
  it 's not only france that is affected by this . 
  however , quite a large part of the negotiations was used to negotiate exceptions from this principle . 
  especially by the french . 
  and no , your companies are producing the stuff because of market demand , not for the sake of making quality products . 
  stating that your companies are somehow except from simple market economics doesnt really make sense . 
   still with regard to food - which is of the most important thing because you 're made of what you eat - canada does n't have the same policies concerning pesticides nor animal breeding standards . 
  and because in europe , an eu law is above the laws of a nation - in france it is written in our constitution ( art . 
  55c if you 're sceptical ) - , you can only accept all these products . 
  that 's inaccurate in two ways . 
  first of all , ceta is n't completely eu legislation , it is a trade agreement that your country has to ratify . 
  and no , there is no obligation to accept all canadian products . 
  this is especially wrong when their standards are n't accepted under ceta . 
  our standards continue to apply . 
  especially those in regards to food safety . 
   accept it even if they contains pesticides in quantities that are n't allowed in your country ( and that you do n't want it in your organism ) . 
  accept it even if the way that the food is produced does n't meet the country animal breeding standards ( and that you can not stand industrial intensive farming and livestock because it 's a kind of animal cruelty ) . 
  accept it even if the product have a huge ecological impact .
