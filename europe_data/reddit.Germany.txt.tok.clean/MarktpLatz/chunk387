  inaccurate as well . 
  read ceta before you make dubious claims . 
   if all of this does n't convince you , maybe economical arguments will . 
  a study caried out by two american economists , pierre kohler and servaas storm from the tufts university , shows what would be the consequences in europe , concerning jobs and economy . 
  it is one study out of many , most of which predict positive results from ceta . 
  a net loss for both sides is more than unlikely . 
  i would classify this as `` pull factors '' , an explicit invitation was n't really required in this regard . 
  which was n't an invitation . 
  [ read this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) . 
  claiming that this statement , which is usually presented without any context , equals an invitation is ignorant given merkels statements during that very press conference . 
  there was n't an explicit invitation either . 
  there is a difference between `` having problems '' and `` getting destroyed '' by a `` muslim invasion '' . 
  you might not be a net exporter , but you are a major exporting nation . 
  in terms of exports , you are # 6 in the world and you are actually running a trade surplus with canada . 
  your quick `` sum up '' is terribly inaccurate . 
  not really , no . 
   good talk mark pleasure !, 
  yes i do . 
  but the experience with single mps holding the whole government hostage to achieve their political goals ( especially in the us ) makes me appreciate this system . 
  another downside , if you want to call it that , is that we do n't have a shadow cabinet ( as it is unclear which parties will be part of the next government ) . 
  plus our parliamentary culture is significant worse . 
  watching debates in your parliament is ten times more enjoyable than watching ours . 
  in this regard , it is a little bit like our court system : not as exciting as its british or american counterparts , but effective and clean . 
  i would consider it a good system for multiple reasons . 
  first of all , we have some accountability through the direct votes . 
  secondly , our vote weight is pretty much the best in the world ( as in votes needed per seat ) which makes everyone 's vote worth roughly the same ( unlike for example your system where votes for ukip are significantly less worthy than a vote for the snp for example . 
  even when you vote green in a very conservative part of germany , your vote will result in the greens gaining something . 
  unlike your system , where the vote would simply be `` lost '' . 
  furthermore , this allows people that are essential for a well-working parliament but not very electable ( for example people with budget expertise - those people usually are n't very charismatic or very good at talking to the `` average people '' but they are needed in the parliament ) to get into the parliament . 
  it allows for more political plurality than fptp systems since you do n't only have two major parties that have a decent shot of getting into the parliament . 
  it increases government effectiveness since the mps have to care less about their individual constitutencies and it means significant gains in terms of stability . 
  something like trump could n't happen here . 
  they can be considered elected representatives for all citizens in the country . 
  only half of our mps are chosen by direct votes , the other half is elected through a list system . 
  pegida does n't enjoy much backing here . 
  i disagree , but that 's due to a different concept of democracy and a different election system . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i do n't see it as a natural development that will eventually happen everywhere . 
  it completely depends on the system . 
  and the german system pretty much ensures that this does n't happen . 
  we have had enough `` charismatic leaders '' . 
  well , we do n't really have this kind of problems at the moment . 
  the afd is nowhere near of getting into power and they are currently following a very determined path of self-destruction . 
  actually that 's wrong . 
  general benefits are still better than no benefits . 
  what matters is that the mp/mep actually considers it beneficial . 
  i did not include no-shows . 
  i think it is fair to include abstentions since they actually make a political statement with their abstention . 
  unlike those who simply were n't there . 
  they are n't capable of delivering promises of this kind . 
  the positive effects are pretty vague and general . 
  it is labeled `` mep votes '' - it is quite obvious what it means if you are a bit familiar with eu terms . 
  i do not contest the need for debt relief . 
  i contest that leaving the euro is a healthy option without massive funding from other countries . 
  more competitive in . . what ? 
  as i said , tourism is n't enoug to keep the county afloat . 
  yup , but greece is already competitive in that sector . 
  their tourist numbers in the last years have been very decent . 
  tourism alone is n't enough . 
  it is questionable how much they would be able to do that without support from the other eu countries or the imf . 
  leaving the euro would certainly trigger a * massive * recession and they would be forced to balance things immediately . 
  amongst other things . 
  it is also due to the fact that germany does n't have as much problems with populist parties . 
  of course you tax the profits - but they are generally created through transport . 
  i did not say that they do not pay tax whatsoever , but he tax rates in this sector tend to be significantly more generous as relocation is easier for these companies . 
  maersk apparently pays around 600m $ in taxes . 
  well , it 's not exactly a `` new '' counterbalance . 
  france has been the counterbalance to germany for decades , however they are having too many internal problems at the moment to fulfill that role . 
  quite honestly , this is common when it comes to trade agreements . 
  simply because they are stuffed with technicalities that no average person will understand and because it 's not easy to quantify the benefits of such an agreement . 
  yup . 
  i did not say that . 
  i simply said that that your statement is incorrect as those who voted abstain * did * turn up . 
  nope . 
  49.1 % is n't a majority . 
  those that voted abstain were there . 
  the uk has 73 meps , only 53 were there .

  lack of competitiveness is n't really something that someone should strive to preserve or even praise . 
  your source actually confirms my claim :  as of 2014 sweden had a positive trade balance of $ 5.78 b in net exports . 
  as compared to their trade balance in 1995 when they still had a positive trade balance of $ 14.6 b in net exports . 
  there 's a bit more to the uk . 
  i was n't fully serious about what they export . 
  sweden has run a constant surplus for the last two decades , the u.k. is a bit of a special case . 
  that 's not limited to greece however . 
  it is nearly impossible to tax transports via ship these days . 
  they have an export industry that is based on olives and feta cheese . 
  compared to countries of similar size , their export volume is laughable , plus they run a significant trade deficit . 
  this is n't sustainable . 
   our ` globalized system ' is based on surplus and deficit units , it is inevitable that these will exist . 
  without a recycling mechanism you 're breaking the cogs that run our modern economy . 
  yup , but constantly running a deficit will cause you problems in the long term if you do n't happen to be the us . 
  the euro surely is n't helping them in their current situation , but returning to the drachma would not fix these things . 
  the root of the problems is n't the currency . 
  yeah . 
  the problem for greece is that this would mean even more austerity , even less investments into their country and a goodbye from debt markets for a decade . 
  plus it would mean problems with the eu as other eu governments hold quite a significant part of their debt . 
  actually that 's wrong . 
  all countries can ( and should ) have an export industry , otherwise we will never see balanced trade .
