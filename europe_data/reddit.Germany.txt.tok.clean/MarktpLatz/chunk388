  not everyone can run a surplus , that 's correct , but everybody can export . 
  that 's what our globalized system is based on . 
  33.2 b is pretty much nothing for a country of greeces size . 
  portugal , a similar sized country ( in terms of pop and economy ) exports 63.1 b , the czech republic exports 162b . 
  and no , an own currency would not help greece as much in terms of tourism . 
  greece already saw record levels of tourism during the last years . 
  their competitors in terms of tourism are either in the euro as well ( spain , italy ) or facing significant problems in tourist bookings due to internal problems ( turkey ) . 
  the netherlands have an intra-eu trade surplus almost twice as big as germany 's . 
  greece was n't competitive prior to the euro either . 
  they killed off any attempt of establishing industry in their county . 
  they had a substantial trade deficit even before the euro . 
  in 1995 , greece exported goods worth roughly $ 11 bn . 
  while they imported goods worth 26 billions . 
   if greeks had their own currency , it would be much weaker than euro , making greek export more competitive . 
  the problem is that greece has no export industry . 
   let me spell it out for you : countries with shitty judicial systems -- most especially including certain countries in europe -- can not actually be expected to follow the rules they agreed on . 
  much less legislatures ( including in germany ) . 
  that 's why there has to be an enforcement mechanism . 
  actually they can be expected to do that . 
  whether it is reasonable to expect that is another story . 
   these kind of provisions are necessary to make trade agreements worth more than the paper they 're printed on . 
  i have never said something else ? 
  and the belgians would make your roads ... illuminated again ? 
   if the rules were that clear , then why did n't trichet do qe under his mandate ? 
  trichet specifically ruled it out because of his interpretation of the treaty . 
  which then was interpreted different by the ecb under draghi ... 
  the only authority to decide this is the ecj . 
  draghi and trichet have different interpretations of their mandate , and this is fine as long as their interpretation is upheld by he ecj . 
  trichet did some [ kind of qe ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2011/10/06/ending-his-8-year-reign-ecb-president-trichet-unveiled-more-qe/#10a51a667079 ) by the way . 
  the legal situation is not different , just more clear due to the ecj judgement . 
  they did not amend the treaties with their decision . 
   regarding your last point i dont want neither a full return to a french style central banking regime . 
  the question is rather on whether we can find a european compromise between the two extreme models instead of just imposing the german one to everyone . 
  the answer is no . 
  central banks are either independent or not . 
  you ca n't be `` a bit independent '' . 
  as long as we do not have joint principles on debt sharing ( and i doubt we will see them soon ) , implementing other objectives into the mandate of the ecb ( like unemployment control ) is n't realistic . 
  yup . 
  isds has been part of trade agreements for decades now , opposition in this regard only became popular in regards to ceta and ttip . 
  in this case , it is an unfounded claim . 
  there was an extensive scientific study on this for the dutch government , and it found that there was no evidence of this happening in rich countries . 
  in this scenario , they should n't agree to these provisions in the first place . 
  but if they do , they can be expected to follow the rules they agreed on . 
   of course those were the rules from the beginning . 
  no monetary financing in the eurozone , no bailout etc. . 
  however as ugly as this may sound , those aspects were completely overlooked by everyone . 
  i once talked to a london trader who described to me the panic in his trading room when they checked the eu treaty and realised that qe was ( back in 2012 ) illegal . 
  they just freaked out !, 
  there was no treaty change since then . 
  the conditions of qe have n't changed . 
   it 's easy to blame on the irish or the greeks , just do n't forget that virtually everyone did not fully understand the implications of the eurozone arrangement . 
  actually it was quite easy to understand for everyone who was part of ems - this included ireland and , to a lesser degree ( they only joined 1998 ) greece . 
  even the uk was n't able to follow our pace ( arguably , due to their own faults , but still ) and they had a much harder currency than any of the southern countries . 
   rules are fine , but when you can have a system in place to quickly revise them after you realize how terrible they are . 
  the problem in the eu is the incapacity / unwillingness to change the treaty . 
  instead we came up with worse solutions that in effect just imply piling up more debt onto the existing pile . 
  changing these rules is a complete no-go for germany and we would probably prefer leaving the euro over accepting a southern europe/french-style central bank system . 
  this is even more relevant due to the implications of the interconnection of our countries through the monetary system .

   alright , what do you say to someone who thinks that corporate court , that have no democratic legitimacy sound absolutely terrifying ? 
  i say that regular courts do n't have much more `` democratic legitimacy '' either . 
  unlike the us , we do not elect our judges , and that 's a good thing . 
  the tribunal is n't made up by some random people that might or might not serve shady interests - the people on the courts are some of the finest lawyers our legal systems have to offer and their reputation tends to be excellent . 
  two of the three judges need to be approved by the government that is defending itself . 
   and that they are not ever going to act for the benefit of the public and always be on the side of multinational corporation 's profits ? 
  i would point them at two things : first of all , the statistics . 
  generally , the states win a significant portion of isds cases brought , that share is even higher for eu countries . 
  if you want numbers - in 50 % of the awards under icsid rules involving eu states , all claims were dismissed ; in 19 % jurisdiction was declined and in 31 % , the claims were upheld in part or in full . 
  this is only the ( 64 % of ) claims where the court actually came to a verdict , 36 % were settled or otherwise discontinued . 
  [ source ] ( http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/490951468251446874/pdf/936280wp0box3800special0issue000eng.pdf ) if you are interested , there are visual representations of this starting page 13 . 
  secondly , parties in isds cases can decline the appointed judge of the other side if there are doubts about the impartiality of the judge . 
  should there be someone who favours the investor side just for the sake of favouring the investor , he will be considered partial and thus he will not see any further cases since the states will reject him as a judge . 
  one more point : i have studied quite a lot of isds cases and i have n't found a single one where the decision was n't justified . 
  the swiss do n't have the reserve currency # 2 . 
   the irony is that if germany were outside the eurozone , then the bundesbank nowadays would be printing billions and buy foreign debt to devaluate the overvalued dm . 
  it would n't . 
  we have never done that and we would n't do that now either . 
  the dm has been valued very highly for decades , yet we did n't take any actions of this kind . 
   the point being , the whole world can not be just like germany . 
  the point is : germany only joined the euro under the condition that the ecb would be modelled after the bundesbank . 
  everybody knew that and everybody agreed . 
  in isds tribunals ? 
  qe does n't really give money to governments . 
  it makes refinancing more easy for them , but it does n't kill off the debt , like it would happen if you indirectly gave them 20 % of the helicopter money through vat . 
  additionally , helicopter money is very much uncharted territory . 
  [ here you go !, 
  ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-eu-canada-comprehensive-economic-and-trade-agreement-draft-legislative-resolution-vote-consent-conse.html ), 
  it is not impartial , but they sourced everything . 
  i ca n't find much more right now unfortunately . 
  there is a serious lack of neutral and good articles about ceta , ttip and isds in general . 
  i can get behind that logic , but i disagree with it .
