  the original meaning was what / u/senfgurke said , but there are reports that the author was n't really opposed to the other meaning . 
  removed . 
  use / r/askeurope , / r/de or / r/germany . 
  i have n't heared of this though and it seems pretty unlikely . 
  the thing is : the article is n't making anything up . 
  the only thing that is a bit problematic is that the article pushes into one direction without considering the other side of the coin ( and the awful headline ) . 
  nope , this taking place ( swedish govt . 
  wearing headscarves in iran ) was confirmed by the twitter accounts of said ministers . 
  it is a topic people on reddit love to go on about while it does n't have much relevance in the real world . 
  what are you implying ? 
  it really is a non-issue and i do not expect any major newspaper to talk about this . 
  this taking place ( swedish government wearing headscarfs in iran ) however was confirmed by their own twitter accounts .

  i did not say that we do not allow criticism of religion , but there is a big difference between insults and criticism . 
  you are free to hold that opinion , but you can not contest that this is a legitimate opinion on it as well . 
  this article only goes into one direction and it is quite pushy on this as well , hence i consider it a shitty source . 
  it 's just words though . 
  i am not aware of any female german politican actually doing this in iran . 
  we remove posts that are breaking the rules , we do n't judge based on whether a post aligns with our personal political preferences or not . 
  in this very thread , multiple users have pointed out that there are good reasons for why this is happening and why it is n't hypocritical or even a `` walk of shame '' . 
  this * is * the other side of this story . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  what are you contesting ? 
  this taking place was confirmed by the twitter accounts of your own government ministers . 
  have i said that i am afraid of the opinion ? 
  in case you missed it - this submission was admitted by us . 
  this does n't make this source any less shitty . 
  a good article about an issue can present both sides of a story and let readers draw their own conclusions . 
  this one does n't . 
  if you see rule-breaking comments , feel free to report them . 
  we can not delete a post simply because we do n't like what it says . 
  it is heavily opinionated , starting with the headline . 
  it is an ngo , not a news source , and it is very likely that the person writing here is n't a journalist . 
  it is n't bullshit , the opinionated part of it and the headline are . 
  the swedish government going over there and wearing headscarfs is a reality . 
  we 'd be happier with a more reliable source as well . 
  but there simply is n't any ( only sputnik reported about it ) . 
  we checked the facts , this actually happened , so we decided not to delete a thread with 200 + comments after 2 hours .

  yes of course . 
  but i am not aware of any muslim politicans/representatives violating these laws here . 
  guys , a few things here : yes , we know the headline is shit . 
  the source itself is n't that good either , but it is pretty much the only source on it , so we decided to leave it up . 
  we recognize that there is a demand to debate this , but please , try to stay reasonable and polite . 
  it is possible to discuss this without insulting people , genders or religions . 
  considering the removed comments in this thread : we do not allow sexism , reaction memes or one-word shitposts . 
  bbc : [ click here for a better article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38956212 ), 
   if we 'd want people to respect our culture as we respect others , would n't we force them too ? 
  no , because our culture is based on allowing everyone to wear what the fuck they want . 
  this comparison does n't even make sense . 
  thats saudi-arabia however . 
  in the same article , you will see aigner wearing a headscarf in iran . 
  removed . 
  we do not tolerate it if people delete their post and repost it to get more attention . 
  well , why should we ? 
  it 's like saying [ maryland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptfl6tia7fw ) should pick a new anthem because they use the melody of `` oh tannenbaum '' / `` oh christmas tree '' . 
  if you are payed to sing an anthem , or even if it is just a ceremonial role , you can be expected to spend a few minutes on the internet to ensure that you pick the right one . 
  you are actually correct . 
  i 'm too tired . 
  not as of yet . 
  let 's see how the rule change plays out , shall we ? 
  wrong place and time . 
  feel free to apply the next time we are looking for new mods however . 
  was n't from our side . 
  the user deleted his post . 
  as i said , learn german . 
  you completely fail to see that this is not the full reasoning . 
  it is a general reference to that song . 
  learn to read german before you make stupid claims that are wrong . 
  i like how you ca n't even read a single word of this and do n't understand that your link doesnt support your claim . 
  it just is n't . 
  because the rest is not the anthem . 
  end of the story . 
  you also do n't sing songs that are n't your anthem and claim that they are your anthem . 
  no , it is n't . 
  who are you to claim that ? 
  seriously , sod off . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
   ffs , it 's not the `` nazi version '' - it 's literally the national anthem talking about how your country is great . 
  it is n't . 
  the national anthem of germany is only the third verse of the `` song of the germans '' . 
  the other two are part of the same song , but not part of the anthem . 
  and no , it is n't about `` how our country is great '' , it is about how all german states become one nation . 
   and it 's one of the less egregious national anthems ( looking at you france `` qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons ! '' ) . 
  it 's not about the text - it is about the historical context and background .

  there is no fixed number . 
   also what is the period of time ? 
  hopefully in years ? 
  trends like this appear and disappear , they do n't take this long to die as soon as we start action .
