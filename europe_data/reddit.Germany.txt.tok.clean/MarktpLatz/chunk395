  * this comment was n't contesting you , it was contesting the claim that `` bavaria has been hit the hardest '' . 
  which simply is n't accurate . 
  * as i have stated in my reply to you , deportations are first and foremost a state matter . 
  which means that a leftwing federal government wo n't really change much in this regard . 
  additionally , the state with the most deportations is n't bavaria . 
  it is actually nrw - which is governed by a spd/green government . 
  [ some numbers ] ( http://www.nds-fluerat.org/20905/aktuelles/auswertung-der-abschiebungszahlen-des-1-halbjahres-2016/ ) ( i know that this is a biased source , but it was the one with the nicest presentation of numbers i found ) . 
  yes , that is total numbers . 
  but if you look at the relative numbers , thuringia is # 3 in enforcing deportations - and they are literally governed by the * linke * * schulz is actually not that far away from the current coalition in terms of deportations . 
  that 's inaccurate as well . 
  bavaria is pretty much the most prosperous state in germany , pretty much full employment , budget surplus , and the share of refugees was n't exactly unfair . 
  63,662 applications in 2015 ; 84,344 applications in 2016 . 
  for comparison : sweden accepted more refugees in 2015 alone , and they have 30 % less population . 
  if you want to compare it to other german states - for example lower saxony and berlin have had more applications per capita than bavaria .

  not really . 
  both the spd and the greens have been pretty `` realo '' in the recent times about the issue . 
  additionally , it is still mainly a state matter . 
  actually we have n't . 
  sweden has taken in over 270,000 people between 2014 and 2016 . 
  that 's 2.84 % of their population . 
  germany has taken 1,424,310 people in the same period of time - that 's around 1.75 % . 
  and quite frankly , italy and greece suffered much more from the impact of the refugee crisis than we did . 
  because contrary to us , they do not have big budget surplusses that could be used to finance the crisis without any bigger troubles . 
  unlikely . 
  look [ where the votes came from ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/dimap.htm ) . 
  does n't have a majority . 
  the interesting part is that the sudden surge in popularity of the spd severely limits the options for government coalitions . 
  given these numbers , the only realistic coalitions are cdu/spd or cdu/green/fdp . 
  yeah , it was my aim to prevent that . 
  i think one month ( survey was closed around nye ) is n't too bad . 
  we will at some point . 
  it is just that we got quite a lot of responses and i would like to sort them into categories ( positive/neutral/negative etc. ) . 
  doing so would have taken even more time , so we considered it to be the best way to release this right now and the rest at a later point . 
  we did n't have such a question . 
  good idea though !, 
  this man is literally less popular than trump or putin or even russian influence in europe . 
  the last time we talked about it ( a while ago ) prague was frequently suggested . 
  yeah we will . 
  but we considered it more important to get this out right now . 
  yeah , saw it . 
  impressive . 
  actually that 's inaccurate . 
  take a look [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5n03gx/german_poll_in_your_opinion_is_there_a_need_for_a/dc7x55x/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) . 
  no personal attacks please . 
  extremely remote thought . 
  it was n't about quality , it was about the frequency . 
  if 13/25 posts are shitpost , that 's definitely too much . 
  stegner does n't hold that much influence however . 
  stegner has always been an exponent of the left wing of the spd . 
   come on , thats ridiculous . 
  first of all , there are many online polls which are not necessary requiring a signing up . 
  all online polls that are actually used for representative polling are including a signup . 
  be it yougov or something else . 
  polls without signup can by definition not be reliable . 
   second , why should this affect the median of the polling values . 
  you need to explain !, 
  to be selected for a phone interview , you just need a phone . 
  to participate on yougov , you need to be active on the web , be part of a certain demographic and you need to sign up for the service . 
  which puts parties like the cdu at a disadvantage . 
   oh wow , so if there is a poll `` on the street '' that would mean , we would absolutely get a more accurate result . 
  have you ever considered that most of these `` polls on the street '' are strongly locally and in most cases even done in urban regions and not rural ? 
  they are not sitting on a market , they are polling in different regions . 
   sorry , but you are wrong again . 
  you should know that polling institutes have their 1000 individuals and polling these people randomly again and again . 
  this is not representative for the entire nation . 
  of course i can compare the us polling institutes with ours since their method of working is very similar ( and cheating ) inaccurate . 
  look at the methodic of the polling . 
   ok , and here we are at the core of my argumentation . 
  i think online polls are way more representative and underestimated . 
  i think the major poll institutes are not polling correct , because they are chosing specific groups of people of which they could be sure to get their suggested polling numbers . 
  online polls are innately flawed as they require singing up . 
  unlike telephone calls . 
  and unlike the us , landlines are still very popular in germany . 
  more popular than being online in fact . 
  since the selection of people is random ( you can easily read up on the methology ) , your argument is n't really valid . 
  allensbach is n't even using telephones , they are conducting their polls on the streets . 
   we saw this behaviour during the us election , when nearly all great polling institutes were proved wrong . 
  hillary clinton was way up in michigan , wisconsin and pennsylvania ... but she lost in all these states and in wisconsin even by a large margin . 
  i am not saying the afd is up by 50 % , but i think the margins are not representive . 
  as i said , you can not compare the us to germany . 
  due to various reasons .
