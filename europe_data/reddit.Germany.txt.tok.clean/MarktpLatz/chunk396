  from the electoral system to the ridiculous weighing of polled people in the us . 
  and point in case : the telephone polls were a lot more accurate than the online poll of insa in the last federal election .

  take any other poll . 
  any poll that is actually made by a reliable institute with a focus on being representative . 
  we closed this thread . 
  public witchhunting is not tolerated . 
  it became clear on the 24th that gabriel would n't be running . 
  the polls were conducted between the 24th and the 26th and were advertized as `` shift due to schulz '' . 
  i think it 's pretty fair that the polls were conducted ( to at least 3/4 ) after it became public . 
  you consider an unmoderated online poll a `` valuable source '' . 
  what the hell are you smoking ? 
  this is n't the place . 
  if you have a complaint about a user , shoot us a mod mail . 
  as far as i know , emnid , forschungsgr . 
  i do not need a new source to `` falsify '' your source . 
  the fact that you somehow believe in the validity of your poll is pretty telling . 
  as far as i know , the polls of emnid , infratest and forschungsgruppe wahlen were conducted after it was clear that it would be schulz . 
  official announcement is one thing , general knowledge quite another . 
  actually it is . 
  i contest your `` poll '' based on the fact that it does n't even have a shed of reliability or representativity . 
  well , these other polls were conducted after it was clear that it would be schulz . 
  i do not think his speech this weekend changed much in this regard . 
  i like how you are ignoring my argument . 
  highly unlikely in my opinion . 
  the other polls are already published . 
  they differ from the insa poll by maybe two days . 
  im rather confident in a long-term increase due to schulz . 
  the spd will get a better result than they would have gotten under gabriel for sure . 
  here 's a big difference : most of the populists in europe do not have any real power - contrary to trump . 
  words are one thing , actions quite another . 
  i am a shit german . 
  never been to mallorca and wo n't go this year either :p, 
  lol . 
  you do realize that you just linked a poll that is n't representative in any way ? 
   being the 4th or 5th largest arms exporter in the world ; to places like qatar and saudi arabia makes you somewhat complicit in the instability of these regions . 
  i disagree . 
  exporting arms does n't make our country any less peaceful , especially when you are referring to the german people like op did . 
   not to mention the involvement in the `` war on isis '' and `` afghanistan '' . 
  we are not fighting wars against anyone though . 
  our participation in syria is also about as peaceful as it can get in military action . 
  yeah , but this is n't that relevant for a simple reason : germanic tribes have little to do with germany . 
  contrary to the word `` teutsch '' , it was never used as a term to refer to the whole of the german-speaking states . 
  it 's a bit confusing given the term `` germany '' . 
  nothing of what you just said is true . 
  it 's not about the newspaper , it 's about the polling institute . 
  not really . 
  you really can not compare the us to germany in this regard and polls have been fairly accurate for the last federal election . 
  take a look [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5n03gx/german_poll_in_your_opinion_is_there_a_need_for_a/dc7x55x/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) . 
  they rose 2-3 % in [ most of the polls ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/index.htm ) . 
  pretty decent if you ask me . 
  how are we not peaceful today ? 
  the only way we even impact other people/countries today is through our economical and political power . 
  the first mention of the word `` deutsch '' was in the fourth century , and back then , these tribes/states did n't have that much in common . 
  it was also used as a degoratory term . 
  yeah , no . 
  i do n't contest the trend , i contest the numbers displayed here however . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  the concept of `` germany '' does n't even exist for 2000 years and there were vast cultural difference since prior to the unification of the german states . 
  and no , germany is one of the most peaceful countries in the world today , combined with priotizing diplomacy over hard power , with a * very * pacifist community . 
  suggesting that we are somehow `` dangerous '' is simply ridiculous . 
  mind to point out some examples ? 
  it 's an insa/yougov poll . 
  they had a worse polling accuracy than most other institutes in the last election , we will have to judge after this election how reliable they really are . 
  i personally have a problem with their method of polling and i think it causes unreliable results . 
  we will simply delete new shitpost submissions at the moment . 
  it is kind of obvious what a shitpost is and what is n't . 
  we will see how we will deal with this in the future . 
  we are still trying to figure out what the best way of dealing with this might be . 
  for a few days at least , this will stay . 
  we certainly wo n't ban fun content from this sub forever . 
  i do n't know about that , but it changes nothing about toyota ? 
  roughly : * today , toyota rarely builds any diesel engines anymore . 
  they only build the 1400 cc engine themselves , they buy 1600cc and 2000cc engines from bmw . 
  toyota buys most of its diesel engines from bmw ... 
  french customers mainly buy french . 
  there is no german car in the top 10 of french car registrations . 
  credible sources : [ fiat chrysler ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/fiat-chrysler-diesel-emission-cheating-software-epa ) [ mitsubishi ( fuel ) ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/business/mitsubishi-fuel-economy-tests.html ) [ mercedes , honda , mazda , mitsubishi ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/09/mercedes-honda-mazda-mitsubishi-diesel-emissions-row ), 
  well , they still face a huge amount of fines . 
  well , fiat/chrysler is currently being investigated for a similar thing and us auto makers were prosecuted for a much more primitive way of cheating ( also to beat emission standards ) in the 90s . 
  you are right though , this does n't justify anything . 
  exatly . 
  the car has a certain yobbo image to it . 
  i do n't know - you probably wo n't be able to find a single mk2 that has n't been modified today . 
   comments with pictures make for poor browsing , like the ones you showed , but until reddit fixes that , it 's def the best option , in my opinion . 
  it 's pretty okay with res . 
  could n't agree more . 
  this used to be the same way here . 
  [ click ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/dotdotdot_of_europe_series ) . 
  we will look into the options and see what will be the best for the sub . 
  sooo ... will you pay back denbts in memes then ? 
  we deleted the newer ones , the ones on the front page will stay until they disappear . 
  shit , you got me . 
  you are correct . 
  modified the text a bit to make this more clear . 
  [ i still miss the mk1 scirocco ] ( http://i.auto-bild.de/ir_img/6/7/5/9/1/9/vw-scirocco-1-5-ts-474x316-c118a10a21ec7138.jpg ), 
  all these pesky `` news '' submissions of course .
