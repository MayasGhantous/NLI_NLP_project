   the thing is that this right is only granted to germans and to eu citizens ( it is only a technicality whether this protection happens through art . 
  9 gg directly or through art . 
  this is rather irrelevant however since the other relevant group in ditib is turkish . 
   the measure is the same which is used to evaluate a prohibition of political parties - a very strict check . 
  the scope is different though . 
  the requirements for the ban of an association are much lower . 
  -- -- -- banning ditib as a whole would prove to be very difficult since it is essentially an umbrella organization for hundreds of associations . 
  banning associations for being `` foreign agents '' is what dictatoships do . 
  what * is * possible however would be banning many of the `` lower level '' associations since they are `` foreigners ' associations '' and can thus be banned much easier through \u00a7 14 vereinsg . 
  especially \u00a7 14 ii nr . 
  1,3 and 5 seem to be relevant in this regard . 
  additionally , you can reduce ditibs influence through cancelling partnerships with them , limiting their operation competences and , probably the most effective , ban foreign preachers/foreign funding for our mosques . 
  this might or might not be possible , depending on how it 's done and how it 's justified . 
  actually , the euro * does * react . 
  just not as much as a domestic currency would . 
   it 's kinda cheating , but it is holocaust memorial day in the uk same in germany . 
   no , i do n't know why this day specifically . 
  it is literally in the wikipedia article you linked : * the chosen date is the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz concentration camp by the soviet union in 1945 *,

   yet whenever everyone talks about the million migrants that were let in you ca n't refrain yourself from quoting it . 
  you are right on the technicalities , but you kill the arguments in an argumentum verbosium . 
  leading the original core discussion to these technicalities . 
  usually it 's other people linking it , but whatever . 
  and to counter `` merkel invited x '' with that post is n't exactly wrong . 
   you reroute the fuckup to `` it ca n't be merkel because technicalities '' . 
  negligence to act is still a way to fuck up . 
  if you had spent the time reading the whole thing , you would notice that i essentially wrote that i think that merkel * had * an effect . 
  i said that she incerased the inflow , but i fimly reject the notion that she caused the whole thing . 
  i actually just mean that the second part is missing , 
   post 3 is approved , after i bitch about it . 
  it would have been approved no matter what . 
  bitching or not . 
   nope , but i can expect them to process it in order this is n't a rule and it also does n't work that way . 
   oh , everyone here is aware of your crush on merkel . 
  you have argued at tremendous lengths over technicalities of how the `` wir schaffen das '' ca n't be linked to her . 
  this does n't mean that i `` have a crush on her '' . 
  you have attacked me for that post in the past , yet you failed to point out * any * inaccuracies in the post . 
  everything is sourced , everything is supported by facts . 
  and while it is none of your business , let me tell you that i have never voted for merkel ( or her party ) and wo n't do so in the next election . 
   the problem is that you are using a grey area to push your agenda . 
  in election times . 
  feel free to point out examples . 
   yeah , right . 
  the previous post ( which got through ) was posted 30 seconds before ( timestamps can attest it ) ; and the other posts were approved 40 minutes after they were initially posted . 
  you 're lying . 
  well , i have a timestamp that attests that the other two posts were approved by a different mod . 
  i only saw the post in question in the mod queue and i approved it immediately after checking the subtitles . 
   is that not a problem of the thing being accessible to english speaking people ? 
  stop playing dumb . 
  no , i said that we therefore only have two people to check whether the subtitles are accurate . 
   dude , you had time for modding the two other posts , yet did not have time for the third which was visible to you at that time ? 
  that does n't hold . 
  this was not me . 
   i have a beef with you because you selectively let things decay in the mod queue . 
  and also because i have to raise hell to actually make the post get non-biased mod attention . 
  i have to actually call you out on your selective modding for it to go through . 
  well no , we do n't . 
  but you can not expect every mod to clear the full queue . 
  we are all doing this on a volunrary basis , if you have ten minutes you spend ten minutes clearing things . 
  sometimes you do not have the time to go through every single post . 
  which means that sometimes an item can stay in the queue for an hour or two . 
   you 're forcefully argumenting for a political leader - as exemplified by your numerous posts - , and you 're also using you powers as mod to push your agenda ; on top of it , at election time . 
  what ? 
  i , even as a mod , am free to hold a polticial opinion ( i do not even know what leader you claim i am argumenting for ) . 
  what matters is that this does n't influence my modding - and it does n't . 
   so you 're saying you reviewed the post , then decided you did not like , but you did not to ban it ? 
  and then you just let it stay in limbo in the mod queue because of a language issue ? 
  what ? 
  i have just seen that post for the first time , checked whether the subtitle matches and approved the submission . 
   the video-encoded english subtitle appears about 0.3 seconds before the first spoken german word is uttered ; in the first 2 seconds of the video . 
  we had issues with videos with inaccurate subtitles in the past . 
   you 're not being honest here . 
  it was is really obvious english compatible content . 
  also there have been lots of non-english content reaching the front page of europe . 
  i did not say that this was a problem . 
   you 're only commenting on it now . 
  you did n't even ban the post . 
  after i had to argue at length with arathian , and after i had to also call it out also on modmail . 
  because i was n't actively modding earlier . 
   now it is just obvious to everyone . 
  so you have beef with me because i approved your post ? 
  it 's not easy , but it 's much easier to get a job here with a criminal record compared to for example the us .
