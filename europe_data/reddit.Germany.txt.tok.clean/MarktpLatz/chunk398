   why not process the third ? 
  because only two of us speak german . 
  it has been approved now . 
  we will in this case . 
  it has been readded . 
   where do i have to quote \u00a7 22 ? 
  just like you did , in the beginning : \u00a7 \u00a7 211 , 22 , 23  only relevant for resignation ? 
  that 's \u00a7 24, 
  well , thank you !, 
   i think he 's more into constitutional law , so i 'll add you to my `` pliz gib help shortlist '' too  actually i 'm mainly into labour law . 
  but i already posted a correction here . 
  the reason why you see me mainly arguing about/with constitutional law here is because the whole stuff related to asylum and foreigners usually touches the constitution . 
   \u00a7 23 ( 1 ) `` any attempt to commit a felony entails criminal liability '' that 's a bit of a botched translation . 
   \u00a7 22 ( 1 ) `` felonies are unlawful acts punishable by a minimum sentence of one year 's imprisonment . '', 
  that 's 12 i  \u00a7 212 ( 1 ) `` whosoever commits murder under the conditions of this provision shall be liable to imprisonment for life . '', 
  that 's 211 . 
  unless you want to go with the opinion of the scientific legal community that 211 is a qualification to 212 . 
   `` the judge cited the teenager 's mobile phone chats as proof of her intent to kill '' we do n't know what she wrote there but it is likely that they found some real bad stuff there compliant with `` base motives '' . 
  actually we know some of the contents , this is firmly fulfilled . 
   according to the case , how this particular case when attacking a police officer was handled before and the talent of her lawyer this could be complied or not . 
  i 'm pretty confident that this is n't fulfilled here . 
   this is definitely something the defence would have tried to neglect so the offence is not punishable under \u00a7 212 . 
  you mean 211 . 
  physical elements ( + ) what exactly do you mean by this ? 
  do you mean `` unmittelbares ansetzen '' ? 
  guiltiness ( + ) would be better translated as `` guilt '' imo . 
  -- you also kind of missed to check the resignation from committing the crime ( not really important though given the circumstances ) . 
  while i can clearly see that this is sarcastic , it 's a bit too much . 
  i wont put too much faith into that however . 
  countless ministers have tried to reform \u00a7 \u00a7 211 & 212 , none of them really was successful . 
  i misunderstood something , ignore what i wrote .

  its on the front page already mate , 
  this topic was discussed in great length [ yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5q65ce/spdchallenger_martin_schulz_as_popular_as/ ) . 
  personally attacking people is n't tolerated by the way . 
  go over to the linked sub and you will be helped i guess . 
  let 's wait for schulz ' press conference on the weekend .

  uhm . 
  so what ? 
  we are not totally opposed to refugees and even the afd does n't propose throwing those that are accepted as refugees here out of the country . 
  actually there is . 
  if every other realistic option fails . 
  which is n't that unlikely . 
   i do n't know , i guess the polish shipyards could build both their 3 subs and corvettes , and the 6 norwegian subs ? 
  that would be too expensive i think . 
  fair point . 
  what is promising in this regard however is that both candidates for the greens are firmly representants of the `` realo '' wing . 
  guys , we know some of you are super excited about this , but please , this is n't the space for juicy schulz memes . 
  if you want to spread your hohe energie , please take it to / r/the _ schulz or we will be forced to take action . 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
   her popularity is actually back to where it was before the refugee crisis as far as i know . 
  [ not really ] ( https://www.zdf.de/assets/politbaromter-abschiebung-asylanten-114~768x432?cb=1484299510392 ) . 
  pretty decent though . 
  certainly better than most other heads of state in the eu right now . 
  the spd would not be particularly happy about it , that is clear already . 
  if there is no other reasonable option however , it still is very viable . 
  possible ( realistic ) outcomes : * cdu/csu-green ( a majority is in the margin of error in the current polls ) * cdu/csu-green-fdp ( would have a majority , but there is n't much precedent for this and fdp and the greens would n't be that happy about each other ) * cdu/csu-spd ( comfortable majority but little desire for it in the spd as they fear to get marginalized even more in yet another grand coalition ) * spd-green-linke ( pretty far off a majority at the moment , but not impossible ) everything else is completely unrealistic in my opinion . 
  the options are sorted by how likely i consider the outcomes . 
  soo , any info on the deal ? 
  is it still three scorp\u00e8ne-class subs for 2.6 bn . 
  like proposed a while back ?

  you just came off a ban and you resume the same shit ? 
  one more offence and you will be gone forever . 
  we do n't even have the power to edit posts . 
  true , but i just wanted to point out that it was n't all good for him . 
  he actually suffered quite as lot due to turkish nationalists threatening him . 
  zis is very zerious !, 
  depends . 
  i did not say that he did n't have a lot of followers here , he nonetheless is a very controversial figure . 
   considering mmt is effectively banned in the eu , china , japan , the usa and canada who managed to find a way to phase it out , it seems canada 's decision was not in fact motivated by protectionism . 
  concern for the environment is a funny way to put it when the problem with mmt is it 's toxic to humans and can cause neurological damage . 
  you do realize that the ban was also challenged by the local canadian govts ? 
  the reasoning of the court is understandable in my opinion .

   well explain the reasoning then . 
  you gave 2 examples but you 're wrong on the first one : give me a case and i will try to explain the reasoning to you . 
  it is usally very helpful to take a look at the documents on isds cases published on [ italaw ] ( http://www.italaw.com/ ) . 
   canadian legislators wanted to ban the use of mmt in order to protect the canadian public . 
  because they could not do so under canadian environmental protection act ( cepa ) provisions , they chose the best available alternative : banning mmt 's import and transport . 
  this does n't make it any less discriminatory . 
  * others counter that outside factors motivated the canadian government 's decision-making . 
  those factors include the fact that canadian provinces successfully challenged the measure in domestic courts and that there was substantial evidence that the legislature was explicitly motivated by trade protectionism rather than concern for the environment . 
  * source : [ the impact of isds in ttip ] ( http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/the-impact-of-investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-in-the-ttip.pdf ) p. 43 - a study prepared for the ministry of foreign trade and development cooperation and for the ministry of foreign affairs of the netherlands . 
   but it seems that they actually listen to him . 
  he 's controversial in germany as well . 
  he is also out of office . 
   industry will be another story . 
  perhaps we finally get some wage hikes to make german industry less competitive - but i wo n't hold my breath . 
  this is already happening .
