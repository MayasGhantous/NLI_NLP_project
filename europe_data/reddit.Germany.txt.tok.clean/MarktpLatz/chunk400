  the eu apparently values democracy , but the governing body itself does n't represents this very much . 
  trade talks do n't have very much to do with democracy . 
  setting global standards is negative ? 
  i would be happy if at least those that are vocal critics of these agreements would try to understand them . 
  because most of the time what they are claiming is simply inaccurate . 
  ttip was about more than `` just '' an increase in economy . 
   i 'm saying bad for consumers mostly because it wants to make the eu and us regulations compatible . 
  which in practice means lowering the standards of regulation in the eu . 
  since they happen to be stricter which i 'm in favor of . 
  this is nothing but an unfounded claim so far . 
  the ttip leaks have shown nothing worrisome in this regard . 
  many standards are not better or worse , they are just * different * . 
  harmonizing those does n't necessarily lead to lower standards . 
  the eu has stated that many of our standards are simply not up for negotiation and ceta shows that they are willing to stand by their promises . 
  the us have higher standards for financial services than the eu by the way . 
   also there are the so called arbitral tribunal ( `` schiedgerichte '' i hope i translated this correctly ) which seem quite sketchy and prone to corruption from what i 've heard , although i do n't know too much about it . 
  the term is isds . 
  it is neither sketchy nor particularly `` prone to corruption '' . 
  it has been common practice for decades . 
  there have been issues with it in terms of transparency in the past , but these problems are fixed . 
  isds is mainly problematic when one side significantly less powerful or developed than the other side ( lets say a deal between the uk and gambia ) , far less so when both sides are highly developed and rich countries . 
   i 'm talking about the lack of transparency because of articles like this that 's common practice for negotiating trade agreements . 
  the security measures were a lot less strict until some parlamentarians decided to leak the contents . 
  unlike in other agreements , the eu has oulined its objectives and red lines on their websites , which is already significantly more than people had in prior agreements . 
  the difference is simply that people did n't care as much in the past . 
  trump does not need to push anything , trump becoming president means that ttip is pretty much dead . 
  he can simply cancel the negotiations for the us side . 
  and no , i disagree that it would be bad for consumers and ttip is the most transparent trade agreement to this day , believe it or not . 
  interesting . 
  let 's see how accurate their predictions for the elections in 2017 will be . 
  well , it is n't our side that 's the obstacle here . 
  it 's russia annexing territory of its neighbors that 's the main obstacle to good relations between russia and the west . 
  [ this seems to be the source ] ( https://civey.com/umfragen/transatlantische-beziehungen-auswertung/ ) . 
  seems like a more liberal form of yougov , so i do n't really know whether this is reliable . 
  no , we should not . 
  we can also threaten to shoot people for jaywalking . 
  it would surely be effective . 
  does n't make it any less ridiculous or stupid . 
  such a kind of punishment would violate the echr and our constitution . 
  that 's a bit simplified and i wo n't agree with this statement . 
  edit : the application of juvenile law on people aged 18-21 varies between 52 % in berlin and 87 % in hamburg . 
  it is when you are sixteen . 
  afaik she is german and the only country in the world that punishes whole families for wrongdoings of a single member of that family is north korea i think . 
  inaccurate . 
  they are considered juvenile until 17 , between 18-21 it depends on different factors whether someone is considered an adult or not by a court . 
  that claim lacks evidence . 
  you are weird . 
  sorry , i think we ca n't afford this raise !, 
  well , he stood up for his opponent [ in the 2008 run ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrnru3ocih4 ) . 
  i disagree with him politically quite a lot , but he has earned my respect by doing that . 
  nothing of what you just said makes any sense . 
  even the quote is completely misplaced . 
  i have been there , it always looks like it was n't set up to last in my opinion . 
  like a temporary airport until the `` real '' one is built . 
  you want to reduce the tax burden of 10.51 million people by 120,000 $ ? 
  that 's a * whole * cent per year . 
  did n't know tax plans could be so ambitious . 
  i maintain my point : this is something worth maintaining , basing it on personal support would be ridiculous , especially considering that our state is a counter-proposal to all these atrocities .

  correct . 
  what new voters could the attact in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ? 
  there were only two parties in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg that are more right-wing than the afd : npd with 23,609 votes and the republicans with 17,475 votes ( plus 718 votes for `` die rechte '' ) . 
  compare that to 1,447,462 votes for cdu or 809,564 votes for the afd . 
  not really a lot . 
  this sounds kind of ridiculous from a today 's perspective . 
  uhm . 
  memorials are an important part for what a country is or has been . 
  it is not `` for foreigners '' , it is for everybody and there is nothing `` loathsome '' about it . 
  welp . 
  you know what i wanted to say :p, 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  i am pretty confident that a vast majority of germans do not have a problem with funding projects like this . 
  especially considering that the funding is ... really not a lot of money . 
  remembering the past also is n't a `` guilt-complex hobby '' . 
  well , `` revived '' . 
  [ this ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/8246830.jpg ) is how it looked when he got to work . 
  the cupola of [ dresden main station ] ( http://dresdner-hauptbahnhof.de/ext_files/pics/news/april03.jpg ) looks a bit like the old reichstag cupola . 
  the us used to have half cents . 
  this is n't `` waste '' . 
  and no , there is no point in discussing this . 
  living here is pretty nice though . 
  the consequences we draw from our history ( calling us guilt-ridden is wrong by the way ) are n't exactly bad . 
  amongst these consequences are approval for the eu , friendly relationships with our neighbors , reluctance to participate in armed conflicts , honouring the fundamental rights of every human being and putting a lot of emphasis on diplomacy . 
  eu-friendly parties are set to win at least 75 % in germany though . 
  even if you think that this is the right way to go , the appropriate way would be to inform about this * in addition * to the third reich/holocaust education . 
  you also fail to see how the teaching here should be centered around things that happened here and with our own involvement , we simply can not possibly cover any genocide that ever happened . 
  and most importantly , other genocides and mass killings/starving should never be used in a way that relativizes the atrocities committed by germans or on behalf of germans during that period . 
  for reference : [ this is how it ended up ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/berlin_reichstag_west_panorama_2.jpg ), 
   no , just the population of an entire planet . 
  you can not really talk about `` suppressing '' in this regard . 
   have you heard about the war on terror ? 
  i was in boston a few years before the marathon bombing and they were playing public service announcements in the subway telling us to keep a watchful eye on strangers and report anything suspicious to the police . 
  `` if you see something , say something '' . 
  bloody surreal . 
  that 's something different .
