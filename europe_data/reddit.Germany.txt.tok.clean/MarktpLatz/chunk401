  asking people to report suspicious things to the police is something fundamentally different than forcing people to report their friends or family if they are critical of the government . 
   i do , but i consider the similarities more important . 
  i still think you can not make this comparison . 
  yes , it is . 
  the us intelligence agencies are not used to suppress the population of an entire country and they also do not employ such a large number of people willing to report people in their personal environment for regime criticism . 
  the nsa , cia and the usai have around 100,000 employees combined . 
  in a country of 320 million inhabitants and with a significant focus on non-us countries . 
  compare this to the stasi : they had 91,000 inhabitants in a country with under 17 million inhabitants . 
  additionally they had around 200,000 informal employees . 
  this means over 1.5 % of the populaton ( formal and informal emplyoees combined ) . 
  if you transfer this to the us , it would mean over 4.5 million intelligence employees . 
  yes , you can argue that we do need less personnel today due to the technological advancement , but still . 
  you see the differences ? 
  nobody expects you to be interested in the motivation - the state institutions should be because this is an important aspect of the judgement . 
  the suggestion that the nazi time is somehow not part of `` the important sites of german history '' is kind of ridiculous and really tells a lot about that party in my opinion . 
   of a newer and a lot more scarier global stasi i fundamentally disagree . 
  yes , there are more possibilities to collect data and they do collect a lot of that data . 
  but comparing todays intelligence agencies to the stasi is doing injustice to the victims of the stasi . 
  summary : after the recent irritation about bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6ckes speech , the parliament faction of the afd in the state parliament in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg has proposed to cancel 120,000 $ in annual funding for the [ gurs internment camp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gurs_internment_camp ) memorial in france . 
  they argue that `` we need to consolidate the budget '' ( that state runs a surplus of 3.5 billions ) and that `` we need to show the migrants a positive picture of german history '' . 
  they also want that german school classes to not make trips to memorials for the atrocities committed by the nazis anymore , but rather `` do field trips to important sites of german history '' . 
  since when is merkel male ? 
  the point of a trial is not only to gather the evidence for such a case . 
  laws are a little bit more complicated than this . 
  it does n't say `` rape - 4 years '' it usually gives a certain frame that the judge can specify . 
  without a trial , it is n't clear whether some qualifications were fulfilled and we do know nothing about the motivation which can play a role as well . 
  you can express your opinion , this does not make it any more justified or any less dangerous . 
  that 's actually reddit-wide policy , not limited to / r/europe . 
   reddit is quite open and pro-free speech , but it is not okay to post someone 's personal information , or post links to personal information . 
  this includes links to public facebook pages and screenshots of facebook pages with the names still legible . 
  i said `` people like you '' . 
  people who want to do away with the rule of law because they feel that it is unnecessary . 
  people like you are the ones ruining our system , honestly . 
  you do not understand shit about this . 
  you completely fail to see that our system is great * because * we give even the most evil people the right to a fair trial , just like to anyone else . 
   now it 's ok - because of news without pictures . 
  well , this allegation lacks basis because the deleted posts did not contain pictures either . 
  only some tabloids ( which are banned here no matter the content ) had pictures . 
  why should they ? 
  giving everyone a fair trial is the fundament of our developed legal systems , it is what separates us from dictatorships and arbitrariness . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  the point where you entered the race does n't really matter , the only thing that matters are your prospects . 
  adn well , macron is sitting around 20 % for the first round . 
  not enough to beat fillon ( 25 % ) or le pen ( 27 % ) , but rather close . 
  hamon would be `` the real underdog '' at the moment . 
  one of the numbers is incorrect . 
  it 's 45.1 % in `` religious laws are more important '' in germany , not 54.1 % based on the original [ source ] ( https://www.wzb.eu/sites/default/files/u8/ruud_koopmans_religious_fundamentalism_and_out-group_hostility_among_muslims_and_christian.pdf ), 
  oxford dictionary : ** underdog : ** * a competitor thought to have little chance of winning a fight or contest * and that is still the case . 
  second round polling : le pen - fillon : 37 % / 63 % le pen - macron : 35 % / 65 %, 
  does n't make her less of an underdog to win the whole election , honestly . 
  she is a force to be reckoned with , but her winning the second round would still be a * big * surprise . 
  first round `` wins '' dont help you much if you are projected to lose the second round to pretty much any other candidate you are facing . 
  this makes le pen the underdog ( at least for winning the whole election ) . 
  why should we do that ? 
  we will allow articles about this as soon as there are better and informative articles about it . 
  this independent article says very little . 
  it 's alright . 
  just do n't do things like this again . 
  i am sure that there will be a decent article that complies with the rules soon .

  sorry , but we have decided to remove this submission since it lacks necessary context . 
  the article barely contains any information and it seems to be based on thelocal , which is banned here . 
  we lack the information to judge whether this is relevant to this sub or whether it is a local crime without any further implications . 
   opening the doors and openly inviting everybody and everything without any sort of checks at the border has nothing to do with the right for asylum . 
  alright , let 's get a few things straight . 
  there was no `` open invitation '' to `` everybody '' and the checks were supposed to be handled by the border countries . 
   no-one has anything against the right for asylum , not even right-wing political parties . 
  actually they do . 
   but the almost exclusively male influx we 've seen in europe , especially from north africa , has nothing to do with asylum . 
  the influx from northern african countries has been neglectable in the last years compared to the middle east . 
  calling it `` almost exclusively male '' is n't correct .
