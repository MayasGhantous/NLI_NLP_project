  males are significantly overrepresented , but it is n't as bad as you make it sound . 
  sorry , but use / r/askeuope for this . 
  i can only talk about germany , but here , you would need your id . 
  it 's the safer bet . 
  no personal attacks please .

  please post the text in a comment - paywall . 
  that 's a fair point to make , but consider this : we are usually * very * strict with us-centric content . 
  it happens pretty often that users say `` please approve this , i know it 's us-centric but it could impact europe '' yet we almost always say no . 
  the inauguration marks an important change and it gives our users the rare opportunity to discuss the events in america without hijacking an unrelated thread . 
  if you look at the history , we had two us threads last year : one for the election and one about trump being the winner . 
  i really do not think that two threads a year are a problem . 
  and given that these threads ( including this one ) enjoy a lot of participation and activity , i think this is the right way to go for us . 
  it is n't . 
  you can get a civil partnership which is * almost * the same , but it is n't a marriage . 
  the country has a pretty liberal attitude in this regard , not just berlin . 
  even a majority of cdu voters are in favour of allowing gay marriage , but the cdu leadership does n't want to do it because they are afraid of alienating ( very ) conservative voters . 
   yes but some ftas are being penciled in . 
  we do not know whether we will get an agreement between the uk and the eu within two years . 
  it is unlikely that the uk can negotiate any major agreements in the meanwhile . 
   guy v seems to want tariffs . 
  verhovenstadt is n't the only person who has a say here . 
   the currency changes . 
  uhm . 
  it doesn ` t ? 
   consumer reactions to toxic brexit negotiations . 
  unlikely . 
   all of these will reduce the numbers and quite drastically imo . 
  i still do n't see why . 
  why not ? 
  the numbers might decline , it is unlikely that they will suddenly stop being a relevant market . 
  the uk does n't have a direct trade deal with any other major car manufacturing country as far as i know .

   well obviously she could have put a stop to it . 
  the bnd is under her purview , right ? 
  the nsa does n't really need the bnd to spy on germany in general . 
   all of this misses that she and her government did n't want to stop it . 
  rather , they very much did want to collaborate with the nsa in order to keep an eye on possible domestic terrorists . 
  all of the major western governments are handing over data to each other in order to get around national privacy laws . 
  they 're using tip offs and leads from the foreign agencies as a loop hole so they can be compliant with the local laws . 
  which is something that she can and should be held responsible for . 
  not for the general spying of the nsa . 
  well , this unfortunately is the wrong place for it . 
  you might have better luck on / r/askeurope . 
  anyways , have fun on your journey !, 
  we are / r/europe and not / r/travel . 
  wrong place mate .

   lol - is n't the uk economy literally bigger than all of africa 's combined ? 
  depends on the value of the pound i think . 
  it 's pretty close though .

  you are still wrong  switzerland is part of the coe . 
  the uk is also part of the council of europe . 
  there is no issue here . 
  you should really look up what the council of europe is . 
  all the countries you just named apart from belarus are part of that organization . 
   if you 've been here a while and see what some of the mods said before they became mods , it 's not surprising . 
  i honestly am not aware of any anti-british guy on the team . 
   look at the subreddit banner ; this is not a europe sub its an eu sub . 
  anyone who is n't a fan is n't exactly made to feel like they 're still european .

   alfa sounds to be less right-wing , or am i reading that wrong ? 
  somewhat true . 
  alfa is essentially the `` old '' afd - not focussed on immigration but opposition to the euro and being somewhat eurosceptic in general . 
  more conservative than the cdu , but still a lot more to the middle than the afd .

  we will not censor opinions , even if they are onesided . 
  everyone is free to hold a negative opinion on the uk ( or any other nationality ) as long as it stays civil . 
  when people resort to namecalling or insults , we will remove the comments if we are made aware of them . 
  if you see such a comment , simply report it and we will take care of it . 
  i do not know whether you are serious , but let me explain why it is n't a dicatorship : * the politicians are still bound by the constitution and the rule of law * the politicians will have to stand in an election a while later and the electorate will decide how good of a job the politician did . 
  * we do not have a direct democracy or imperative mandates , politicians are bound by only two things : the law and their conscience , nothing else . 
  and that 's kind of the point . 
  that 's already a better reason for opposing ttip than the reason of 95 % of its opponents . 
  i expect the government to take things like this into consideration , but i can not agree with the government giving up on such a trade agreement because an uninformed majority opposes it . 
  good arguments  numbers of opponents, 
   yes you do , because fta allow to settle a factory in country with lower wages . 
  if a country maintains tarrifs it forces a producer to maintain facilities and jobs in the country they want to sell to avoid paying tariffs . 
  as i have already told you , these countries are already here with full access to our market , they are called poland , czech republic , romania etc. 
  the us is n't that much of a threat in this regard . 
   you assume that being opposed to ftas is wrong and based on wrong facts but there are many people who give good arguments against it . 
  there are many viewpoints and many opposing interests .
