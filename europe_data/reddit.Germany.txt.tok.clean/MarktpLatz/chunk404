  would n't really surprise me . 
   i think the only risks are long-term . 
  lack of proper investment or attempts to appropriate technology and know-how . 
  but then , this is true for any other company owning the grid as well . 
   other than that i do n't even know why they 'd even want to buy it really . 
  i feel like it does n't give that much real political leverage in the long term . 
  maybe just a decent way to `` store '' your money . 
   and now it 's a foreign owned public company , one of the foreign owners in question being a dictatorship , and the other ... and that changes what exactly for the uk ? 
  the people that are employed are still british and there is literally zero chance that china or qatar will order the grid to be shut down . 
  and even if they did , it simply would n't happen due to obvious reasons . 
  what matters is that they are decent at their job , invest into the grid , and treat their employees correctly . 
  depends on the users . 
  if users decide to assault other users or to engage in hate speech , their comments will be deleted . 
   but it may be too late when they 're dangerous . 
  i think you have a wrong conception of `` dangerous '' . 
  `` dangerous '' very likely does n't mean `` close to getting into power '' . 
  this is n't part of the courts reasoning and also wrong since these people already do vote afd . 
  npd was marginalized by the afd .

  the industry claims that it 's due to the sanctions . 
  unless you can prove otherwise , this is what we know .

  it will become less speculative over time though , i think . 
  for the next two years i guess ... 
  germany alone lost around 20 billion in annual exports to russia . 
  this does n't even factor in the hypothetical growth . 
  i did not mean that . 
  i mean that we have a different opinion on whether walking away from trade talks would equate `` cutting your arm off '' . 
  and since i know you stance and i know mine , i do not think that we can come to an agreement here . 
   eu is not going to put up its own prices . 
  eu wants to sell things . 
  perhaps you mean eu putting up tariffs ? 
  this was meant as a metaphor for what the parties want from the negotiations . 
  i did n't mean this literally . 
   with each year that passes ( look at the last decade ) the percentage of the uk 's trade with the eu falls relative to its trade with the rest of the world . 
  it is already happening faster than people predicted and the uk ( if we play are cards right ) . 
  would still hurt ... a lot . 
   i do n't think that the uk government sees it like this . 
  i also do n't think that our arm would be cut off ( any more than the vote to leave itself caused any harm ) . 
  well , i think there is no point debating this , 
  inaccurate . 
  the last 12 posts you made were all approved . 
  as i have told you multiple times , the posts are removed and put up for review if they trigger certain keywords . 
  i see exactly two german-language articles in your history that were removed . 
  no personal attacks please , no matter who you are talking to .

   i am just worried that in two years time there might be some more extreme people in various eu parliaments and that it is all a bit unpredictable . 
  i am assuming that merkel will read them the riot act though ... 
  the only factor in this i can think of would be le pen . 
  nothing else would cause a major change in this regard . 
   in the last few days many commentators and politicians have told may that she has to be able to walk away from a bad deal . 
  there is a consensus in the uk that cameron 's deal was bad because he was not prepared to walk away from it . 
  from a negotiation standpoint , this is true . 
  but it does n't match the reality . 
  it is n't like the uk wants to buy steel and could simply turn to another supplier if the eu does n't make a good price . 
  as you have said in the past , the uk might try to focus more on other countries outside the eu , but you will agree with me that this will take time ... a lot of it . 
  such a change does n't happen overnight . 
  hence why i do not not consider the threat to be credible . 
  threatening to leave the negotiations is like saying : `` give me what i want or i 'll cut my right arm off '' essentially .

   i agree , it might be problematic for various countries to agree it . 
  i do not think that the countries will have a problem ( except maybe belgium due to wallonia lol ) but the electorate might demonstrate ... for whatever reason . 
   the talks might fail or parliaments might vote against it . 
  i do not really see this threat . 
   uk has to be able to walk away for starters and has to make that clear at the start . 
  this is what i do not consider a very credible threat . 
  there is a lot on stake for the eu - there is * much * more at stake for the uk . 
  sorry , we do not allow self-promotion and we do not allow blogs .

  stop claiming this . 
  you somehow went on a `` wont bother to translate '' spree at some point when the only reason for our removals is that you do * not * provide a translation . 
  i will approve this one to show you that there is no problem here from our side , but i expect you to put up a translation or a short summary with the most important points . 
   however , this does give the uk an opportunity . 
  i disagree a bit here . 
  no matter whether trump actually goes for these bilateral trade offers with the eu or not - it was pretty clear that the uk would go for a trade deal with the us .
