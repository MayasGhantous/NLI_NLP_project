  i ca n't say that i am sad about that . 
  i would trust either of them to lead germany . 
  i have a few reasons why i do not want such a government : 1 . 
  i know that many people will disagree with me on this , but i am absolutely no fan of introducing referendums on a federal level in germany . 
  all of the three parties in this coalition are in favor of this . 
  i dislike a large portion of the leading personnel of said parties . 
  it would mean gabriel as a chancellor 4 . 
  some of these parties are too appeasement-happy when it comes to russia 5 . 
  in the times of the brexit negotiations and trump in the white house , i want germany to be as strong as possible . 
  it is delusional to believe that anyone could fill merkels boots in terms of power immediately . 
  well , the question is what `` values '' a cdu-led government would counteract . 
  most of the positions of the cdu/csu are actually the positions of a vast share of the population . 
  it 's mainly gay marriage and public referendums where this is n't the case ( cdu/csu opposes both ) . 
  i do not think that either of these issues is a real dealbreaker . 
  same for me . 
  i wo n't vote for the cdu however . 
   sucks for / r/theschulz though , going so strong with their memes and then this . 
  : / it 's / r/the _ schulz and it will give them more time to grow and collect their power , 
  if you look at the current polls , the chance of a leftwing government are minor to say the least . 
  depending on the poll , they are between 39 % and 41 % - which leaves them at least 5-6 % off a possible majority . 
  additionally , the * linke * on the federal level is notoriously unpredictable , forming a coalition with them would prove very complicated . 
  no , he resigned because it was agreed that he would resign after two years . 
  he would be willing to run , but he will not go up against the spd leader , gabriel ( who will likely be the candidate ) . 
  however , he has a very decent shot of being the candidate in 2021 and he will likely be appointed foreign minister since our current one , steinmeier , will be elected president next month . 
  of course they do . 
  most of the time is not all of the time . 
   a publication made in a second rate local ublisher is n't going to be cited a lot regardless of the language used . 
  it does n't need to be a lot , but the chance for a second rate publication in english to be cited is significantly higher than if it was written in german or polish for example . 
  they have a natural language advantage though .

   if someone had written a sentence `` there was a ` genocide ' of the jews '' , making it look like the person is questioning the holocaust , would a sentence like mine still gotten me a warning ? 
  yes . 
  personal attacks are never justified . 
  if you see an outrageous comment that is breaking the rules , there is the report button . 
   edit : and the dude called me a `` mini-soviet '' , which is as insulting as saying `` mini-nazi '' to a holocaust survivor . 
  it is n't . 
  well , for the full spending there is always [ bundeshaushalt-info . de ] ( https://www.bundeshaushalt-info.de/# ) . 
  other sources :  the estimate is based on the assumtion that we will have 600,000 refguees in 2016 , 400,000 in 2017 and 300,000 refugees in every year after that . 
  it also estimates that 55 % of accepted refugee will have found work after five years . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-05/fluechtlinge-kosten-bund-ausgaben-2020 )  13 billion $ fund [ source ] ( http://www.epochtimes.de/politik/deutschland/schaeuble-erwirtschaftet-2016-7-milliarden-ueberschuss-13-milliarden-ruecklage-zur-finanzierung-der-fluechtlingskrise-a2021793.html )  according to the faz , that fund was n't even accessed [ source ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/wolfgang-schaeuble-will-schulden-mit-haushaltsueberschuss-tilgen-14628418.html ) -- about spending on `` healthcare '' - our public insurance funds are running a surplus as well . 
  the difference would be marginal honestly . 
  this includes everything . 
  in fact , we used last years surplus to set up some kind of `` backup fonds '' for the refugee crisis - worth 13 billion euros . 
  turns out that we did not really need to access that money . 
  the refugee crisis turns out to be `` cheaper '' than the estimated 90 billion . 
  in part due to the fact that this number was estimated with the expectation of another 600,000 people in 2016 . 
  mind to elaborate ? 
  last year 's surplus was spent on a backup fund for the refugee crisis . 
  the money before that was spent on the greek bailouts i think . 
  no matter whether justified or not , we do not tolerate personal attacks here . 
  personal attacks are n't tolerated . 
   long time no see - how 's cleaning the spam queue going ? 
   the queue is full :p got ta do some work after this comment . 
   and as i said , take them to the camp at 5 km from austria and show them the way ... thats not very well-mannered though . 
   cough , cough - we did/tried to . 
  hungary announced we 're out of dublin in july already . 
  simply abandoning the old reigme does n't equate `` changing the rules on time '' . 
  replacing the old rules with something that works is .

   also how accepting are germans in general to foreign students ? 
  very . 
  both in terms of the general student population as well as the government . 
  universities are generally free of charge for foreigners as well ( apart from a small fee for administration and train fare ) . 
   how hard/easy will it be ? 
  learning german might prove to be a bit difficult . 
  germans have a tendency to switch to engish if they notice that someone is n't completely fluent in german .

  well , we prefer that sport even when we are not world champion  second would be handball i guess . 
  football . 
  you should either go to / r/askeurope or to / r/travel . 
  additionally , i 'd suggest taking a look at the national subreddits for this . 
  / r/europe is n't the appropriate place for this unfortunately . 
  the apartments were sold , so they are privately funded . 
  the hotel was meant to be privately funded by * westin hotels & resorts * but as the building costs started to climb , they said this would not be profitable for them anymore . 
  as a result , the hotel was built with taxpayer money as well . 
  the amount of money is n't exactly clear , but its assumed to be somewhere between 130-200m $ . 
  however , the money the hotel is paying for using the space apparently covers all interest payments on the loan for that money . 
  so it is essentially some kind of zero-sum game for hamburg ( in the projected scenario ) .
