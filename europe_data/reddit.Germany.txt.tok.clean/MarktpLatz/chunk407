  feel free to delete this one and resubmit it to have the proper link , 
  just a suggestion in this regard : 1 . 
  reddit has a `` save '' button . 
  you can create your own subreddit for stuff of this kind . 
  this allows you to do whatever you want . 
  it does n't even have to be public . 
  it can be a sub just for you . 
  / r/earthobserver is still free by the way !, 
   particularly the auto moderator criteria as you 've mentioned . 
  the articles that are removed by the automod are not removed because they are in a non-english language but because they trigger certain keywords . 
  one example : during the us election , we filtered `` trump '' ( amongst other keywords ) to prevent us news spam on / r/europe . 
  as a result , a spanish or german article containing `` trump '' would have been temporarily removed just as a nyt aticle containing `` trump '' . 
  well , we already did ... somewhat , 
  we approve non-english articles as long as people provide a translation or at least a short summary . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because the information was recently posted .

  as for niqab or burqa - they are so rare in germany that they are honestly statistically irrelevant . 
  even the shops that sell them say that they do not have them in stock because nobody ever buys them . 
  they also say that 90 % of their customers buy them because they need it for a trip into a country where they are mandatory . 
  as for hijab - if women wear them based on their own and free decision , there is nothing to complain about . 
  if they are forced to wear it , this is a different issue . 
  so no , you can not really paint this black and white and make this about `` being for or against equal rights for women '' . 
  i am for eqal rights and still i can disagree with you . 
   `` not all x are like that '' is a common way of down-playing issues . 
  well known cognitive bias . 
  i did not say that . 
   you try to force the matter on us , and the eu has free movement so it matters for lots . 
  moreover , germans certainly have opinions on brexit do they not ? 
  we are not trying to force anything in this regard . 
   it 's a bunch of small ones culminating in a large one . 
  death by a thousand cuts is still being cut to death . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
   are you saying that rome did n't grapple with the divided loyalties of its new subjects before the end ? 
  i simply said that whatever happened to rome is not transferable to todays germany . 
  well , it just is n't though . 
  and that wo n't change either . 
  no , it just prevents sticky posts from appearing on / r/all . 
  this is completely irrelevant as a population switch is n't happening ? 
  well , source these claims . 
  look at the front page announcement  this `` open forum '' post was never supposed to happen , there was a mistake in updating the automod schedule . 
  that was n't a no . 
  can you please leave that to us germans ? 
  you comment on something you have no clue about from an outsider perspective . 
  this is n't a `` large demographic shift '' 3 . 
  this analogy does n't exist in that way . 
  in fact , it is completely wrong . 
  some are , some are n't . 
  but that is n't the point . 
  what matters is that they have n't really `` changed germany '' . 
  the change that happens through social progress alone is much , much more significant . 
  today 's germans probably have more in common with many of the turks living here than they have in common with the people in germany in the 50s . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  population numbers are fairly neutral and not dependent on who the people are . 
  for now , the decline is halted , there is no point in contesting that . 
  for the consequences , that 's a different issue , however i see no real reason for concern . 
  we have several times more turks in the country than we have refugees and they did n't `` change the place '' either . 
  this is still very firmly germany and we have n't really become `` less german '' through migration . 
  please use / r/askeurope . 
  actually i would argue that it 's not because our `` people are awesome '' but because we have reliable and independent judicial systems enforcing these laws . 
  it 's a pretty vague question , so i would n't read too much into it . 
  the table is mine , compiled from the data that is available on wahlrecht.de, 
  the full results are not published yet , but there is not really a reason to doubt the results . 
  jung & naiv has [ worked with yougov ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/r/52/befragungsergebnisse_yougov_jungundnaiv_september2016.pdf ) before . 
  i do not really like jung & naiv and i think that the polling method of yougov has flaws , but i do n't think that you can call the legitimacy of the poll into question . 
  i am really looking forwards to the next federal election in this regard . 
  yougov is the one polling agency in germany where the cdu is polling 4-5 % lower than according to the other agencies . 
  in the last federal election , e.g. 
  forsa was much closer to the actual results than yougov ( insa ) . 
  - | cdu/csu | spd | green | fdp | linke | pirates | afd | others -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- result | 41.5 % | 25.7 % | 8.4 % | 4.8 % | 8.6 % | 2.2 % | 4.7 % | 4.0 % forsa | 40 % ( -1.5 ) | 26 % ( +0.3 ) | 10 % ( +1.6 ) | 5 % ( +0.2 ) | 9 % ( +0.4 ) | 2 % ( -0.2 ) | 4 % ( -0.7 ) | 4 % ( -0 ) yougov | 38 % ( -3.5 ) | 28 % ( +2.3 ) | 8 % ( -0.4 ) | 6 % ( +1.2 ) | 9 % ( +0.4 ) | 3 % ( +1 ) | 5 % ( -0.3 ) | 3 % ( -1 ) infratest | 40 % ( -1.5 ) | 28 % ( +2.3 ) | 10 % ( +1.6 ) | 5 % ( +0.2 ) | 8 % ( -0.6 ) | 2.5 % ( +0.3 ) | 2.5 % ( -2.2 ) | 4 % ( -0 ), 
  that 's not the point he was making though . 
  that would be completely fine even from a constitutional standpoint . 
  it would be problematic if there was an authority checking on news * before * they are released . 
  but that is n't even proposed - the whole issue that this poll is bringing up is artificial . 
  nobody has even proposed such a thing . 
   however , there are limitations regarding personal insults etc. 
  which can be very relevant in this regard . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1693 ) is the translation for the chapter on libel and slander for all non-germans . 
  the whole discussion about this is misled however - just like jung & naiv likes to operate . 
  nobody even seriously proposed a new federal ministry for this . 
  what * has * been proposed is a task-force to tackle fake news . 
  and in reality , this looks a lot less outrageous than it is often propagated . 
  it is mainly directed at facebook , twitter et . 
  - forcing them to establish a center for complaints that people can reach 24/7 and offering people negatively affected a right to have the wrong claims corrected in public ( pretty much how it is for newspapers right now ) . 
  it would certainly be a personal attack ( unless it is clear that it 's in a joking manner - `` grammar nazi '' for example ) . 
  whether it is hate speech would depend on the circumstances in my opinion . 
  you see , the issue is this : all of these threads ( apart from the sunday one ) were n't stickied by us . 
  as a result , most of them did not even make it to the front page of / r/europe due to a lack of upvotes . 
  this was in part caused by the high frequency of these threads - it has little effect when you sticky something for one day . 
  hence , many users probably did n't see the threads in the first place . 
  since it will be less crowded now , we will sticky them again . 
  our aim is n't to reach reddit-wide visibility through reaching the front page , our aim is to increase the visibility on / r/europe . 
  let 's see how that goes . 
  we already have [ this post about it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5mqfal/un_baltics_can_into_nordic/ ) . 
  removed . 
  removed . 
  this is the most pixelated picture i have seen in a year . 
  it 's not mean , it 's the rules . 
   i know i could be using / r/askeurope , but i like it much better here . 
  we would prefer you asking over there anyways .
