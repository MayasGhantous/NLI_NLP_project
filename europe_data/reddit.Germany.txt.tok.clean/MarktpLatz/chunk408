  the answer to that is no and no . 
   i 'm not interested in how they ( do n't ) work . 
  you can not improve or change that system unless you understand why the system is working in the way it is ( not ) working . 
  simply saying `` we are doing things differently now '' does n't change factual realities , it does n't abolish the state of law , it does n't abolish state souvereignty and it does n't abolish human rights . 
  you make it sound like you do n't have a single clue how deportations work . 
  you know that trader joes is also owned by aldi ? 
  as for growth : they are projected to increase their annual sales to around usd20 bn . 
  by 2021 ( compared to 13 bn . 
  now ) . 
  that does n't exercise any feel of dominance ( walmart us + sams club sold 350 bn . 
  last year ) , but it still is a very significant growth rate . 
  please provide a translation or at least a short summary .

  indeed . 
   what about guttenberg joining the afd or maybe dieter bohlen as the secret trump card , he could make germany great again . 
  both options should be added to the betting sites in my opinion . 
  now , * that * would be fun . 
   but is it more likely than petry as chancellor ? 
  in this election - it is n't . 
  in the future , that might be a possibility , but not in 2017 . 
  he would need to make a surprise comeback in the csu , become party leader instead of seehofer + win over the cdu to support him instead of merkel . 
  ( i really feel ridiculous even thinking about that scenario right now ), 
  well , hopefully . 
  that would pretty much open pandoras box . 
  interesting . 
  apparently i checked every single polling agency but missed infratest dimap . 
  but whatever , it does n't really change anything . 
  thanks for the correction . 
   first at all , happy new year !, 
   thanks , same to you !, 
    no , the link i sent you was filtered for arrivals in greece only . 
  on hungarian police site you can see towards end of july 1500 + people being cought ( nb . 
  the number is probably higher ) - that 's why i linked arrivals in greece , easier to count people arriving on 3 islands than over a 150km long border . 
  this does n't really confirm your claim that you had `` 3-4000 arrivals a day '' though . 
  even 2-3000 people is a high estimate in my opinion . 
   we would had closed the border as well immediately + moving all migrants on our territory in the open camps next to austrian border . 
  unlike austria - which at that time were busy bashing us for the fence , we were actively working to protect the whole border ( said fence ) . 
  you would still have been stuck with a pretty large amount of people you do n't want ( and that you ca n't really get `` rid '' of through legal means . 
   which ones ? 
  you had two poles : merkel and v4 basically . 
  i was taking a broader approach in this regard . 
  you can start in greece , go further to countries that let refugees pass through without any checks and if you look a bit in the past , it is every single european leader apart from italy for not changing the goddamn rules on time . 
  italy asked for help and legal changes a decade back , pretty much all countries blocked them , including us . 
   i do n't think the alien tort statue has ever been used to obtain reparations whats actually kind of `` funny '' is that the herero tried to pursue the path through ats once before , just targeting a german company and not our country . 
  they withdrew the case though as far as i know . 
   even if this recently happened the supreme court severely limited the scope of the ats in kiobel v. royal dutch petroleum company was n't that mainly about targeting companies though ? 
   but courts have overstepped their bounds in the past . 
  a french court held it had jurisdiction over yahoo sales at its us url , in english , hosted on us servers , in us dollars , targeted at us customers . 
  my prediction is a dismissal . 
  well , the internet is a special matter . 
  we also see this from the us side in regards to microsoft . 
  i think they just mean a parliamentary majority that can elect said person chancellor . 
  and well , despite his promises , i still think he might try to make a comeback some day . 
  but the chances of him returning for this election * and * actually getting elected are legitimately zero . 
  they would be lower than zero if that was possible . 
  so ... that means fake news then ? 
  the church is n't germanys oldest church , it was n't burnt and the `` raping people daily claim '' does n't even have any source . 
  he 's probably one of the people that are responsible for ridiculous betting odds like this . 
  does n't have a clue what the fuck is going on , but feels qualified to make comments/bets . 
   so why do the gamblers think so ? 
  i was going to bet against afd myself until i asked myself the all important question of `` do i know german politics well ? 
  '' , and then i decided that betting when i know little beyond wikipedia is a bad idea . 
  you got yourself your answer . 
  it is people who did not ask themselves that question and just bet based on a feeling or a mistaken understanding of german politics . 
  nobody in their right mind would bet on frauke petry becoming the next chancellor . 
  not even frauke petry herself would bet on that i assume . 
  there are multiple reasons for that . 
  the afd has never polled higher than ~ ~ 15.5 ~ ~ 16 % on the federal level , and that was only at two points : at the height of the refugee crisis and immediately after the terror attack in december . 
  the party itself is having severe internal power struggles . 
  frauke petry is pregnant . 
  it is not certain that she can campaign right after giving birth . 
  even in the most right-wing states of germany , under more favorable conditions for that party , the afd does n't poll higher than 25 % . 
  all parties that have a chance of getting into the parliament have ruled out forming a coalition with the afd . 
  this would mean that they would be required to have an absolute majority on their own . 
  which is pretty much unprecedented in our country ( it happened once in the 50s iirc ) . 
  -- -- -- to add to that , looking at the odds on your site : there is no way in hell that martin schulz has worse odds than petry and steinmeier and guttenberg should not even have a chance to appear on that list . 
  steinmeier has a 99 % chance of getting elected president soon , guttenberg is not even considered .

  can not comment on that , we do not track things of this kind as far as i know . 
  and even if they were - this does n't make them any less eastern european or any more arab . 
  not going to happen honestly . 
  it would be kind of ridiculous to award reparations here . 
  the newspapers say nothing about the prospects of this case however . 
  and i do not beleive that anything will come from this . 
  does n't change the fact that i consider this a bit ridiculous , 
  this argument however is nullified given that the numbers in the whole of germany have been stable as well . 
   erh . 
  i think you are reading too much in the skynews article here . 
  the only thing the article says is that the guys went to a lawyer , who wrote the paperwork and brought it to court . 
  in no way it indicates the court even had time to read said paperwork so they did n't even had time to toss it out . 
  well , there is a bit more background than just that skynews article .
