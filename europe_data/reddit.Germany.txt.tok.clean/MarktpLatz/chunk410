  but as i said , there are a lot of factors playing into this . 
   one interesting thing about uk system versus german system is that partly as a result of fptp our labour party always has to be in an exhausting coalition between our social democrats and our linke because the furthest left bits of the uk electorate have nowhere else to go . 
  and now suddenly the linke faction ( corbyn and his allies ) have taken control over that coalition ... 
  which is why i prefer the german system in this regard . 
  you as a voter can have more influence on the layout of the government . 
  lets say you are a true leftwinger in the uk : you only have the option to elect labour and then hope that the leftwing forces * inside * that party will win the inner-party power struggles . 
  while in germany , you can simply elect the * linke * for that . 
  on the other hand , the chances of them becoming part of a government are lower here . 
  but that 's mainly due to history and not a systematic fault in my opinion . 
   i am assuming that linke do n't even really want to be in government in germany ... well , thats only partly true . 
  you have to know that there is a significant divide between linke politicians in the `` old '' states ( western germany ) and in the `` new '' states ( ex-gdr ) . 
  the people from eastern germany tend to be pragmatic and are open to government participation ( thuringia even has a linke-led government and its working pretty well ) . 
  the people from western germany in that party tend to be fundamentalists who prefer `` staying true to themselves '' over government participation . 
  it 's also much easier to be in the opposition - you never need to follow up on anything , you can just complain about everything . 
   i liked it when hollande declared his enemy was finance and then the cameron trolled him by saying that london would roll out the red carpet for french bankers . 
  now he is trying to troll the uk again after brexit . 
  anglo-french rivalry never gets old . 
  well , lets see how that goes . 
  frankfurt does n't mind some of the british bankers either , but we are less agressive about that . 
   while hollande has not been good for france , i am very worried that fillon seems to be quite pro putin . 
  this could potentially put both the uk government and the german government in very difficult positions . 
  well , still better than le pen . 
  it also depends on what stance trump ends up taking in this regard . 
  france would by far not be the only country taking such a stance in europe - italy and greece for example have long demanded the sanctions to be lifted . 
  and the uk - well i am a bit concerned about your political weight in such a decision given the circumstances . 
  not with the current polling . 
  even if the fdp does n't make it - they are 7-8 % off a majority . 
  if the fdp does make it , they are around 10 % off . 
  and this is just the maths - forming a coalition with the * linke * would likely prove exhausting as hell . 
  i wonder if anyone of them will make an election campaign like hollande , promising to `` end the german rule '' etc. , visit berlin after the election and everything will go on as it did previously . 
  if the fdp * does n't * make it , we will have a cdsu/green majority . 
  i would call this the most likely coalition in such a scenario . 
  the spd has little appetite for another grand coalition and at least parts of the greens would like to become part of the government again . 
  jamaica coalitions are still very much uncharted territory , but it can very well happen . 
  yup . 
  boring as fuck . 
  but hey , in these times , thats positive in my opinion . 
  honestly , everybody but le pen will be a significant upgrade from hollande in my opinion . 
  exactly . 
  and i really am thankful that our election campaigns do not take as long as in the us . 
  otherwise , we would already be campaigning for like half a year . 
  the second question asked was : do you feel safe in germany ? 
  results : 73 % `` yes '' - 26 % `` no '' . 
  you do realize that he is n't talking about the polling divergence , are you ? 
   the real question is whether they will overtake spd and become the second largest in germany actually this is completely out of question . 
   sigmar gabriel , leader of spd , is historically unpopular and have taken the party from 40 % to 20 % this was n't gabriels work however . 
   merkel insistence on her open door policy alienates voters . 
  i do n't know what you are seeing , but i see the union polling at 37 % - which would be merkels second best result . 
   a fillon in elysee could work with a cdu/csu/afd this coalition is a non-starter . 
  not going to happen whatsoever . 
  fillon would also work with any other leader in germany . 
  there is n't really an option . 
   naturally visegrad are n't going to complaint either . 
  properly 4 more years to cdu/csu/spd trio ? 
  what the v4 think is irrelevant to our internal election . 
  either cdu/csu/spd or cdu/csu/greens or cdu/csu/greens / fdp . 
  those are the most likely scenarios .

  which is why i suggested converting these judge positions into other branches afterwards . 
  and we can be very open about that . 
  i think there is a certain number of people who are willing to work for two years in vgs knowing that they will end up in other court branches afterwards . 
   no , the problem would be solved , because they would n't be here . 
  this does not `` solve '' the problem . 
  the main problems are n't the ones germany is facing , the main problem is that there are millions of people that have nobody to take care of them in this scenario . 
  it does n't solve the problems , it merely relocates them . 
  that 's sufficient for some people i guess , i disagree that it is a solution . 
   we could also use the exact same amount of money the million costs us and support at least five million people in camps in turkey . 
  we could , but we would n't . 
  and that 's the issue . 
   only because you want to pretend she did n't . 
  as i said , link me a statement that is an explicit invitation . 
  i have written [ a lenghty piece ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) on why there was no explicit `` invitation '' . 
   yes , really , yes . 
  we will not find a common ground on that . 
   so what ? 
  it would not be sufficient . 
   yeeees . 
  that 's the point . 
  without proper funding , this would turn into even more of a mess . 
   of course there was and that 's why everybody started coming . 
  stop pretending there was none . 
  well , link me to a statement of merkel that was an `` invitation '' . 
  you will not find a statement that reads `` syrians of the world , come to germany ''  no , fact . 
  not really , no . 
   who said anything about the date ? 
  obviously selection would be based on the grades of those that apply . 
  but why would you hire someone who has been working as a lawyer for five or ten years ? 
  well , i assumed you meant that by saying `` only hiring new graduates '' . 
  and the question is : why not ? 
   of course not , i was actually under the assumption that 8 +8 would already be enough . 
  it depends on where you want to go . 
  and considering the `` lower scores '' - it depends on how many extra judges you want to hire . 
  there is a certain margin that you could hire without any loss in quality .
