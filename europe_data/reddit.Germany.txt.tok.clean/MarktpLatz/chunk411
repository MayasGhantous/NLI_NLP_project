  lack of funding in the 16th century , in part caused by the reformation , resulted in the building process to be stopped . 
  i can only assume that the plans were put into some kind of archive and subsequently forgotten/lost . 
  funfact : on the top of what would later become the twin tower of the cathedral , there was a [ crane ] ( http://www.koelner-dom.de/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_kran_antik_23f62e73db.jpg ) made out of wood and iron . 
  it became the de facto landmark of cologne and was eventually removed in 1868 . 
  the crane was from around 1350 . 
  they even lost the original plans for a while . 
  and after a few hundred years ( not kidding ) they rediscovered them and said `` hey , we have this huge unfinished church in the middle of our city , how about finishing it now ? 
  well , yeah . 
  what pisses me off more is the missed opportunity for a full-glas roof like in berlin . 
  i mean come on , you have one of the most impressive buildings in germany right next to you but you ca n't see it out of your train because of ... reasons . 
   47,300 court cases from syrians , estimated to double next year . 
  actually that 's only our most populous state . 
   terrorist attacks that did not have much of an effect honestly . 
   rapes overall rape numbers are stable . 
   something that 's usually not reported on is the general hostility towards women , i saw a report from france that some suburbs had no women on the streets because muslim men were so hostile towards them being outside . 
  are we france ? 
  in case you do not know : the muslims in germany , old ( turks ) and new ( syrians , iraqis etc. ), 
  are a different group of people than the muslims in france which mainly originate from african countries . 
   there 's no way similar things are n't happening in immigrant-heavy suburbs in germany . 
  well , bring evidence . 
  speculation doese n't make a very compelling argument . 
   so this is what i was thinking about . 
  there were church buildings there from the 4th century . 
  yeah , but this does n't really count honestly . 
  usually its only the crypt remaining from older churches if they got replaced by newer churches . 
   but how is it with the one in trier ? 
  wikipedia says that the first building was started in 270 but that the current building was started in 1235 , which would make it pretty well almost the same age as the cologne cathedral . 
  the difference is that trier got actually finished . 
  you can not really count cologne - [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/botanischer-garten-am-dom-um-1820.jpg ) is how the cathedral looked in 1820 , almost 600 years after they started building .

  it 's a matter of definition . 
  on paper , poland has few asylum seekers from ukraine ( according to eurostat , they recieved 2,275 applications in 2014 and 2,295 applications in 2015 from ukrainian citizens ) . 
  you get to the hundred thousands if you include the people enjoying a de facto refuge in poland despite not being officially registered as asylum seekers . 
  i know the official term , but internally they are still referred to as `` assessors '' . 
  and no , i would simply select them on their qualification , not based on the date of their graduation . 
  there is a downwards trend in the qualifcations anyways - so accepting people with grades 8 +9 or 9 +8 would n't break the system . 
  additionally you have to consider that the requirements used to be much higher and many people only barely did n't make it despite them having sufficient grades under the current reuirements . 
   edit : wait , is it 1300 years old or was it started in 1300 ? 
  started in 1248 , finished 1880 ( yes , this is not a typo ) . 
  and the old structure burned down pretty much completely . 
   if you say so , but it would solve the problem . 
  only in theory . 
  in practice , even germany would not have provided enough funding in the region to take care of everyone . 
  and we are curretnly the country spending the most in the region . 
  it really is according to the saying : `` aus den augen , aus dem sinn '' here . 
   of course it 's an option . 
  the one that should have been used after the first couple hundred thousand at least . 
  and merkel should n't have invited everyone in the first place . 
  sorry , there was no explicit invitation . 
   well , again another reason merkel should have thought about before , right ? 
  debatable . 
  if i am not mistaken , you can actually do that in the time where the judge is still an * assessor * and not a full judge . 
   irrelevant . 
  could also have been dealt with by paying for camps elsewhere . 
  nope . 
  this does n't make the reason any less valid . 
   i said we should n't have let them in in the first place !, 
  you asked for the reason why we we accepted them . 
  closing the border completely is n't exactly an option for us . 
  so there will always be people coming in . 
   of course we can , turkey is perfectly save . 
  in regards to turkey , it 's the lack of a treaty allowing us to send back people preventing that . 
   oh gee , i 'm sure they do n't want to live in berlin . 
  and if they ca n't find something people like you will complain about living conditions . 
  pretty much everything breitbard said was wrong . 
  starting from calling it `` germanys oldest church '' ( it is n't ) , implying that 1000 muslims set fire to a church on purpose ( there were 1,000 people in total , not even all of them foreign ; the church itself did n't catch fire and it also was n't done on purpose ) , the claim that these people `` threw fireworks into crowds including children is misleading , making a connection to al-qaeda from the display of a flag that could either be a flag of the fsa or the old syrian flag is kind of ridiculous . 
  it also was n't a `` mob '' . 
  so yeah , that 's around 80 % of what was written in breitbarts article . 
  [ she did n't ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ), 
  india is not in europe . 
  fascinating . 
  but this might not be the right sub for this . 
   and yet we do for no reason . 
  two reasons : first of all the humanitarian cause , secondly the factual reality of us not being able to deport people to hungary , greece , turkey or the coutnry of origin , as i already said . 
  as a result , we have two options : either decline their request for asylum/refugee status and tolerate them - which would mean that they would still be here , still recieve welfare . 
  otherwise , you can accept them , which could have more positive consequences . 
   we did n't send them back , did we . 
  that is kind of the point . 
  we did not send them back because we could n't . 
   we barely have any apartments left for them or our own poor people to live in , but we are doing fine . 
  totally . 
  it always depends on where you look . 
  of course , that space is very limited in the big , popular cities . 
   no , we ca n't because that demand is temporary and extraordinary and after it 's gone we 'd have too many judges . 
  i disagree . 
  but i think neither of us two is really qualified to make a qualified guess here . 
   obviously , but verwaltungsgerichte are usually not , are they ? 
  it is possible for judges to switch the `` branch '' . 
  so we could `` use '' some of them in the vgs and switch them to other courts later on . 
   this is a typicall exceptional regulation , interpreting it the way you do it in your comment above is politically biased and doesn \u00b4 t meet the meaning of what the article was originally designed for - as an exception . 
  actually you can consistently apply exception clauses without any legal problems . 
  especially if they are clauses of this kind . 
  and quite frankly , this is in the nature of this agreement - we are not burdening anyone else by doing so . 
  you can not simply say that we can not use the provision that way because you do n't like it . 
  it is a political decision , but we are/were free to make that decision . 
  you also ignore the factual realities that led to us having to keep pretty much any legitimate refugee who made it here .
