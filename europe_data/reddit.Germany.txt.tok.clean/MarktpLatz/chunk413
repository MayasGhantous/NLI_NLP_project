  not even close . 
  that 's political reality . 
  additionally , for example lebanon could not house much more refugees . 
   also if you say `` yeah if you come via boat there is zero chance of your family coming over and you will be detained '' i imagine less people would take the journey as there would be very little incentive . 
  as i said , this is all fair and well , but unrealistic unless you have a chance to establish the infrastructure for such a scheme . 
  which seems pretty remote at the moment , especially given the tensions with turkey . 
   if the people in charge were able to handle the amount of refugees then we would n't get news about refugees suing germany . 
  if you read the article , you would notice that a lot of these cases are caused by the refugees wanting another status/treated unfairly . 
  the cases where their applications took too long could have been avoided if we had employed more public servants earlier . 
   also they did not even apply for asylum in other safe countries . 
  the dublin regulation was suspended because of the migrant crisis . 
  if they can suspend the dublin regulations i 'm pretty sure they can extend the `` response '' time when it comes to accepting refugees too . 
  again , dublin iii covers that . 
  even without suspending . 
   suing a country because they 're not responding fast enough is a dick move . 
  not really , no . 
   if you 're a refugee you 're required to seek asylum in the nearest safe country . 
  that 's the law . 
  you are not . 
  there is no legal obligation for refugees to do that . 
  the law goes the other way : countries have no obligations to accept refugees that have already passed a safe country . 
   germany ( other countries too ) instead was really nice and allowed refugees to come and ignore that law . 
  ( travel through half of europe without applying for asylum ) you are wrong . 
  we did not ` ignore ' the dublin agreement . 
  dublin iii included specific provisions allowing us to accept asylum seekers anyways . 
  not even talking about factual and legal realities that prevented us from sending people back to hungary , greece , turkey or the country of origin . 
   now the very same refugees are being ungrateful because germany ca n't handle the amount of refugees they accepted . 
  we are doing fine , thanks . 
  this is not about `` not being able to handle the amount '' . 
   isnt it reasonable to expect long wait times when you have so many people applying ? 
  it sucks for them , sure , but thats just how it is . 
  you can expect the government to act in such a case . 
  if the waiting times are getting too long , the government either needs to get more efficient or it needs to hire more people . 
  this is true for asylum cases in the same way that it is true for cases affecting the regular german . 
  this is especially true when it is a pressing issue like your legal status and not you wanting a building permit for a shed in your garden . 
   and whats even the point in suing when there is already a law in place that clearly states when family is allowed to come over ? 
  serious question , because i really dont understand it . 
  [ click ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5m0hng/thousands_of_refugees_are_suing_germany/dbzzr0h/ ), 
   so the journey is more dangerous than the area they are currently in then . 
  because i know if i had a choice between staying in a very dangerous area or taking a pretty dangerous journey to reach safety i 'd choose the latter every time . 
  safer than the journey can still be pretty damn shitty/dangerous . 
   yeah and that 's why it 's a bad idea to accept them , it 's discriminatory towards those with money and leaves the poorer behind . 
  it would be better to invest in improving the camps so all can benefit instead of just the privileged few . 
  i can get behind this line of argument , but it does n't really speak against accepting them . 
  germany and the uk are pretty much the main countries providing funding for the camps , so we should look at other countries if we want to blame someone in this regard . 
   then you could arrange a system to take people direct as a family group after screening . 
  this is nice talk , but not very realistic . 
  total resettlements in 2015 , one of the worst years in terms of refugee flows totalled 80,000 people . 
  that 's nothing . 
  literally nothing . 
   people arriving by boat should be detained and deported as they are jumping the queue so to speak . 
  that 's nice talk , but unrealistic . 
  where do you want to deport them to ? 
  you can not legally deport into countries like syria . 
  demanding that you are treated fairly and in accordance with the law also is n't really something one should complain about . 
  the rule of law is one of the main pillars of this country . 
   why would they be left behind ? 
  because the journey is n't exactly safe and because it was pretty damn expensive even for a single person . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
   mass sexual assault i am not aware of `` mass sexual assault '' apart from the nye incident last year . 
  the rape numbers and sexual assault numbers are pretty stable . 
   unrest you do n't really notice any `` unrest ''  increasing number of asylum applicants what are you talking about ? 
  the numbers are a tiny fraction of what they used to be in 2015 . 
  nope . 
  iirc the expected family reunification count is around one person per accepted refugee . 
  as a result , you have to substract those who do n't get accepted in the first place and those that leave on their own . 
  the `` funny '' thing is that they are doing this to get these `` abandoned '' people over here , into safety . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  they are not suing based on eu law . 
  they are suing based on german law and their objective is not to allow family reunification for people with subsidiary protection status , their objective is to have their status improved to `` refugee '' ( which would cause them to get faster reunification ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/ovgs/vg_duesseldorf/j2016/3_k_7501_16_a_gerichtsbescheid_20160810.html ) ( in german ) is one of these judgements . 
  the judgement is based on \u00a7 113 v 1 vwgo , the reasoning is that not granting these people refugee status is not in accordance with \u00a7 3ff . 
  asylg which incooperated the directive 2011/95/eu into german law ( see bottom for this directive ) . 
  many lower courts have agreed with the refugees recently ( around 90 % of people suing got their status improved ) , arguing that every refugee could be in danger if he returned to syria simply based on the fact that they applied for asylum here . 
  however , the highest bavarian administrative court has recently taken a [ step in the opposite direction ] ( http://www.lto.de/recht/nachrichten/n/bayverwgh-21-zb-16-30338-asyl-fluechtlinge-syrien-subsidiaerer-schutz-fluechtlingseigenschaft-bamf/ ) ( german ) . 
  we will probably see a judgement from the highest german administrative court ( bverwg ) at some point in this regard . 
  the refugees could sue based on eu law if germany outlawed family reunification for people with subsidiary protection , but this is not the case , it is merely delayed for these people . 
  if that was the case however , this would be the relevant eu law : [ directive 2011/95/eu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2011:337:0009:0026:en:pdf ) art . 
  23 :  maintaining family unity  1 . 
  member states shall ensure that family unity can be maintained . 
  member states shall ensure that family members of the beneficiary of international protection who do not individually qualify for such protection are entitled to claim the benefits referred to in articles 24 to 35 , in accordance with national procedures and as far as is compatible with the personal legal status of the family member . 
  paragraphs 1 and 2 are not applicable where the family member is or would be excluded from international protection pursuant to chapters iii and v.  4 . 
  notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 , member states may refuse , reduce or withdraw the benefits referred to therein for reasons of national security or public order . 
  member states may decide that this article also applies to other close relatives who lived together as part of the family at the time of leaving the country of origin , and who were wholly or mainly dependent on the beneficiary of international protection at that time / u/vertikal19, 
  it 's not about `` not liking it '' it is about demanding to be treated in accordance with the existing laws . 
  that 's nothing outlandish . 
  rebuilding syria might be a bit hard at the moment .

  no personal attacks please . 
  no matter if you are eligible for aslyum or not , at the moment you apply for it , your crime of breaching the border is healed . 
  actually it is a crime , it just gets `` healed '' when you apply for asylum .
