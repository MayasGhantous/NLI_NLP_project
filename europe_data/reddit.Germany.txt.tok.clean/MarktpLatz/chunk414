  you are correct . 
  the '' / s '' was added after my reply . 
  without it , this could very well have been a legitimate attempt of criticism . 
  i 'm not really an expert on this , but it looks that you already posted in the right subs . 
  you just happened to get a very bad timespot , most people wo n't be online on jan. 1st . 
  take a look at the things written and linked in the sidebar of / r/suggestalaptop i 'd say . 
  good luck !, 
  month . 
  this is the wrong sub mate . 
  of course its political and i do not deny that the statistic is n't showing the full picture . 
  these `` data tricks '' were introduced decades ago however ( bl\u00fchm was quite `` successful '' in presenting the numbers in a better light ) , they were not introduced recently and are thus not responsible for the change . 
  soo ... time for a new war ? 
  well if you are pedantic you could say that the growth in employment could have been bigger . 
  but i wo n't complain , i think introducing it was the right way to go . 
  they are jobs where you do not work full-time and earn below ~ ~ 470 $ ~ ~ 450 $ . 
  if you earn below ~ ~ 470 $ ~ ~ 450 $ , you do not need to pay social insurance which makes them attractive for employers and certain people . 
  given a minimum wage of 8.84 $ , you can not work more than 50 hours a month in a job like this . 
  i decided to approve the non-mobile version of the articlle instead . 
  have a nice day !, 
  they do n't `` get removed anyways '' , it did get removed temporarily by the automod since it triggers key words . 
  i decided to approve the dw article that got posted a few minutes after yours because it is in english . 
  i hope you are okay with that , 
  it * is * wrong to say that . 
  people not appearing in the statistic is systematic , what op ( jokingly ) suggested would mean that we changed the definitions to reduce the number of unemployed people on paper . 
  that did n't happen though . 
  the definition of an employed person by eurostat is much broader than our own definition , as a result we are listed as ~ 4 % in eurostat compared to ~ 6 % in our own statistics . 
  minijobs are a tricky issue , however the recent developments on the labour market in this regard are positive . 
  it also is n't appropriate to criticise minijobs in general - many people simply do not want to work more than that . 
  any evidence for this happening ? 
  unless there is any , this is just baseless speculation . 
  the federal bureau is n't perfect , but we are much stricter than eurostat in measuring employment . 
  it 's a shit post about the alleged arabization of germany or something like this . 
  the picture was taken when the brandenburg gate showed the turkish flag in solidarity with turkey after them suffering from a terrorist attack . 
  you forgot `` nazi communist '' . 
   what exactly did the deleted comments say ? 
  most of them were either low-quality circle-jerking , advocating violence or personal attacks . 
  yeah , totally ... that 's why your comment is left standing . 
  keep telling yourself that we mods are only out for censoring `` dissenting '' opinions .

   crap , i remembered wrongly . 
  2-3000 people were in july-august . 
  still plenty of time to react ( till september ) - especially when trends were going only up . 
  source : https://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 ( you might need to tweak your browser to allow the unsafe script ) . 
  2-3000 people a day were the total for europe . 
  you can not tell me that all of them went into/through hungary . 
   also trust me - as long as the border to austria was open we were doing fine that 's a bit of a nonsense argument . 
  the border to austria was open * because * they knew that our border was open as well . 
  had we taken a page out of your book and closed our border , austrias border would have been shut within hours as well . 
  which would have left you with a * very * significant number of refugees compared to your population size . 
   the person who sent the dang tweet wrt syrians for sure . 
  i was mainly talking about european leaders , but alright .

  the last g7 summit was worse in this regard .

  removed . 
  use / r/askeurope . 
  and you know that because your police publishes statistics after every big event and says `` no sexual harassment whatsoever '' ? 
  uhm . 
  so what ? 
  sorry to break it to you , but this is n't something special for events of this kind . 
  read the article . 
  they screened people from the mena region to kill off any chance of a repeat of last year 's nye . 
  it is n't nice that this has to happen but calling this `` again '' is blowing things out of proportion . 
  the number of crimes committed that night , both sexual and non-sexual was nothing special for a event of this kind . 
  the 160 crimes committed were crimes committed in total by the way . 
  there is no `` again '' . 
  literally nothing happened .
