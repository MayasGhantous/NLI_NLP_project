  and before you call us lazy , what about reporting the comment to us so that we have a look at it ? 
  that feature exists for a reason . 
  we do not have the capacity to read every single comment . 
  i have said nothing like this . 
  it does n't make ops statement any less inaccurate however .

  that 's the actual number of women affected by sexual assaults . 
  even your edit is inaccurate . 
  the total number of women assaulted was around 1,200 . 
  nothing to be proud of , but still miles away from `` thousands '' . 
  and that is for the whole of germany . 
  if you stick to cologne , it 's 650 .

  greece is pretty much the worst investment destination in europe though . 
  putin would prefer someone else , honestly . 
   for you it maybe tragic . 
  for us - not . 
  maybe it seems strange , but this how it is at this moment . 
  we do not expect you to mourn the dead , but we expect you to show some decency . 
  it does not matter who these people are . 
  you can claim that they are `` a weapon '' - yet it is pretty certain that most of those did not do any direct harm to anyone in your country . 
  you can not win wars by singing . 
  and additionally , i am pretty sure that its not the choir members that are selecting the songs here . 
   p.s. 
  are n't those terrorist are human first too ? 
  or they , are not humans ? 
  what the difference except they are your enemies and those are ours ? 
  are we only free to praise your enemies death ? 
  in my ( personal ) opinion , they are human too and i do not believe in capital punishment , no matter how big the atrocity committed . 
  i would have preferred the berlin attacker to get prosecuted and thrown into jail . 
  however , the policement pretty much acted in self-defense ( he had a gun ) so i wo n't complain . 
  local news are allowed . 
  as long as they have a credible source . 
  a danish article from some minor danish local newspaper would get downvoted anyways if it 's not interesting . 
  we would still ask you to provide high quality , relevant content . 
  or at least extremely funny content . 
  just fyi - we do not have a `` local news '' rule anymore . 
  we do have `` local crime '' instead which is more narrow . 
  you are not seriously comparing a terrorist with a gun being shot by police to a tragic accident , killing dozens of people that have done no physical harm to someone else , are you ? 
  even the suggestion is ridiculous . 
  guys , we know that this is an emotional topic for some of you . 
  some people , for various reasons , do not have the best opinion of russia . 
  nevertheless , we would ask you to remain civil . 
  whoever these people have been or what they have done , they are humans first and foremost . 
  celebrating their death will thus not be tolerated , comments of this kind will be deleted and the users might get punished . 
  the same goes for memes and shitty reaction gifs . 
   a leader will always avoid getting put in a situation where `` reacting '' is the only way out . 
  that 's as important as creating the opportunities . 
  srsly , project management 101 : risk list , all with mitigation plans , etc. 
  well , somewhat . 
  but there can be leadership even in situations where only `` reacting '' is possible . 
  take the financial crisis for example . 
  as long as leaders are following the financial market movements , they are reacting . 
  if they go beyond reacting however , forcing the financial markets to look to the politicians instead of the other way around , it turns into leadership . 
   there were 3-4 000 edit : per day , migrants going through hungary in march-may already . 
  source on these numbers ? 
  i would call those into question . 
   we were n't . 
  really . 
  or you think that our riot police ( one of the few things actually well functioning in this country ) ca n't cope with 2000 people ?? 
  edit : also do you have a source ? 
  i keep hearing this ... 
  it 's not about 2,000 people . 
  source is for example the phone call that i linked in my `` invitation '' thread - unfortunately the newspaper that wrote it went bust and the article is no longer available . 
  additionally , we have a long series about what happened in the relevant days in the print version of a major ( and very reliable ) german newspaper which i have as an epaper but not where i am at the moment . 
   therewasanattempt - give me that . 
  well , i will give you that . 
  i still disagree with that attempt and we both agree that it was n't `` leadership '' . 
   my leadership test is the following : is anyone following out of their free will ? 
  well , i disagree . 
  you can also `` push '' leadership in politics . 
   merkel failed btw . 
  in this regard - yes . 
  but if we are fair , there are more people than herself to blame for that failure .

   it is impossible - they 've been removed by now and my memory is not so good ... 
  but i described what i saw people expressing . 
  well , i only see valid removals , sorry . 
  if someone feels that their post has been removed unfairly , they are free to message us or create a thread in / r/europemeta and we will try to explain to them why we removed their comment . 
  i hope you understand that we can not mark every removed comment with the reason . 
   ps my previous post was deleted due to sputnik link . 
  somehow i see it in the thread when i 'm logged in , but do n't see when i log off . 
  yeah it was , saw it . 
   on request , yes . 
  that is , if i did n't miss a earlier post of you . 
  thing is , if you ( plural ) do this unnoticed , how can we be sure that nothing gets removed ?
