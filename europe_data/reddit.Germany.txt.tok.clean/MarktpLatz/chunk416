  what do you expect ? 
  do you want us to write a comment with the removal reason behind every removed post ? 
  that 's neither practical nor useful . 
  it would also greatly increase our workload . 
  you will have to trust us on this . 
  if someone feels that their post has been removed unfairly , he or she can either write a modmail or create a thread on / r/europemeta about it if they feel that the removal was n't justified . 
  you misunderstood what i asked from you . 
  i did not want a background for claims , i wanted you to point at a specific comment that was removed where the removal was n't justified in your opinion . 
  i was n't asking a question about that song , i was asking him to point out a specific comment that was removed wrongly . 
  and i have to say that it is quite funny to be accused of a `` russian appeasement trip '' when we usually get critcized for `` bashing russia '' . 
   about the low-quality gifs : i understand that they are forbidden , but only as posts , not as comments , i guess ? 
  low effort comments , memes and excessive circlejerking : this is especially enforced in news submissions and political debates . 
  * deleting said comments is fully covered by this . 
   for the `` talking shit about the dead '' , i did n't see the comments to have an opinion on if the mod 's actions were needed or not . 
  but if you delete user 's comments , at last tell us and give us a reason . 
  if you do n't , this place gets the smell of censorship and `` guided enviroment '' really quickly . 
  well , i gave the reason . 
  presenting several examples of deleted comments would kind of ruin the purpose of deleting them , do n't you think ? 
  use / r/europemeta for complaints of this kind . 
  link ? 
  you have a wrong impression here . 
  the comments we removed were people celebrating the death of these people and shitty reaction memes/gifs . 
  if you have a specific complaint , please use / r/europemeta . 
   idk if the userbase got worse over the years or mods dont moderate as wellas they used to we are a bit short on staff due to christmas . 
  all of us also have a life outside reddit . 
  we do our best detecting comments of this kind , but we simply do not have the capacities to check every single comment . 
  if you see something that is breaking the rules , report it and we will take care of it . 
  i wo n't go into specifics , but we had several comments containing low-quality reactions gifs or posts that celebrated the death of these people/talked shit about the dead . 
  i hope you understand that we do not tolerate comments of this kind . 
  please use / r/askeurope for questions of this kind . 
  removed . 
  at the point where he was arrested , the time span was too short to even check the surveillance tapes . 
  how would that have changed anything ? 
  european bureaucracy . 
  quick and efficient . 
  just how we all like it ,

  this is n't the appropriate sub . 
  his reasoning was a bit vague though . 
  he really tried hard to avoid saying that he wo n't go for security reasons and presented it in a way that he simply think its not appropriate to party with a terrible event like this that recently .

   you are pushing for a biaised view . 
  i 'm sure you 're well used to bulldozing people with an endless discussion so we 're not having one . 
  it boils down to what she said vs how she controlled how it was heard . 
  this debate is moot now anyway , enjoy your 1.2 million lawyers and doctors . 
  so you can not point to any inaccuracies in the submission , yet you call it propaganda . 
  nice . 
   you do it frequently . 
  this one from 13 hours ago was an easy example to find . 
  you say `` agenda pushing/unreliable source '' . 
  first those are two orthogonal , very different things . 
  the source is very agenda pushy and , well , a random youtube channel . 
  which justifies this . 
  apart from this , op editorialized the video title in a way that qualifies it as `` agenda pushing '' . 
   second , it is very clear you are the one pushing an agenda here . 
  you do n't like what is displayed here and you blindly censor it . 
  uhm . 
  we generally do not accept videos of this kind unless they come from a news network . 
  there is a reason why lifeleak is banned here . 
   you 're doing a crappy job by confusing your ( publicly-well-known ) opinion with your powers as a mod . 
  third , as a mod you have the moral obligation to show restraint and use another account for your political opinions . 
  again , there is not evidence whatsoever for this . 
  you will not find a single mod here that would have approved that video . 
  i would have no problem whatsoever allowing a newspaper article about that demonstration . 
   we have a different definition for backpedaling . 
  to me , going from `` we will do this '' ( words from you sacro-saint post ) to `` repatriation , repatriation and once more , repatriation '' is backpedaling . 
  feel free in continuing to maintain your own reality distortion field . 
  and do continue in your blind , misplaced love of someone who is fucking most of its european partners over , in countless ways . 
  she is the main source of euroscepticism by a hugely far margin . 
  you guys might like her , but she 's selfishly eating away at the core part on which your economic success lies : the eu . 
  well , that 's up for debate .

  describing my submission as `` propaganda '' is ignorant . 
  everything is sourced , if you want to contest something , feel free to point out inaccuracies or mistakes . 
  just claiming things does n't really mean anything .
