  please point out examples where i `` confused modding and political commenting '' 3 . 
  even though you describe it as `` backpaddeling '' it really is n't . 
  merkel still maintains that her decision was correct and no measure that has been enacted has touched the essence of her acting . 
  merkel did not say that we should n't have allowed these people in , she simply argued that we were n't as prepared as we could and should have been . 
  this mainly depends on their country of origin though . 
  looks okay to me , but it has already been posted . 
  bild wo n't be allowed either . 
  as i said , we do not accept tabloids as sources . 
  the quality of the specific article does not matter in this regard . 
  rt is n't allowed here either . 
  / u/whelping _ monster is correct . 
  removed . 
  we do not allow tabloids . 
  please try to find another source . 
  removed for : * lack of context * low quality * editorialization * agenda pushing/unreliable source, 
  removed . 
  use / r/askeurope . 
  i am a lawyer , thank you . 
  i am aware of the legal realities . 
  it is not what an average person understands under `` rape '' however . 
  i have checked the sources , do n't worry . 
  however , they do not paint an accurate picture . 
  there were actually `` only '' three rapes if you consider rape to be defined by penis -  vagina sexual intercourse . 
  the `` rape '' definition in the articles includes other things as well .

   sorry , 24 rapes , 2300 + reports of sexual assault . 
  wikipedia has ( unsurprisingly ) no source to back this number up . 
  there is no reliable source that talks about 24 rapes , sorry . 
  three is the number . 
  you should really check your sources before making ridiculous claims . 
   up and not reported on for almost a week . 
  inaccurate . 
  regional newspapers picked it up on january 1st , we had reports in nation-wide newspapers on january 2nd and full-scale coverage from january 4th . 
   and people found out about the cover up a week later , so no harm done . 
  uhm . 
  this does not change anything ? 
  again - its a state matter , not a federal matter . 
  this is n't really the core responsibility of our federal police . 
  you said `` hundreds of migrant rapes that were covered up '' . 
  there was a total of three rapes on nye if i recall correctly . 
  you can not really call it `` covered up '' when that was n't successful, 
  this was n't successful however and it was condemned . 
  so where is your evidence again ? 
  there is no evidence whatsoever of this happening . 
  it has served us well . 
  he also did n't have any gunshot residue on him despite the fact that the original driver was shot . 
  rule of law . 
  our law mandates that suspects will have to be presented to the responsible judge on day one after the arrest . 
  if the judge considers the evidence to be insufficient , the suspect will be released . 
  this means that they had until midinight today to bring solid evidence for his guilt . 
  they obviously did not and thus he was released .

  we do not even try to help everyone . 
  the experience is pretty solid by the way - look at the numbers from the balkan wars . 
  the problem with pakistan is mainly the government there by the way . 
  which has been proven to be ineffective and which does n't prevent crime in the first place . 
  oc/source ? 
  because afaik they display the flag of berlin on the gate today . 
  yes , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  i wo n't rule it out that a real terrorist could do the same however . 
  i did say nothing about believing a terrorist . 
  i simply said that it is rather unusual for a terroriat to act that way . 
  well , obviously . 
  yeah . 
  thought the same . 
  usually they will boast about what they did if they get caught . 
  well , determining this is n't * that * easy . 
  he denied any involvement apparently , but so could the real attacker . 
  there is no video recording of the incident afaik , this makes confirming this rather difficult . 
  collecting evidence takes some time . 
  removed . 
  local crime . 
  sorry , but this is n't the right sub for this , unfortunately . 
  i would suggest using / r/askeurope instead . 
  you do realize that the people actually paying money at the moment are the creditors ? 
  well , this is all well , but can you tell us where the money is going to come from , mr. tsipras ? 
  i am aware of what the dublin regulation is 2 . 
  the tagging was n't done by greece and italy for the most part 3 . 
  the enforcement of external borders is not our responsibility , it is the responsibility of the border countries 4 . 
  dublin actually does not say that we have to close our border ( which is nonsense anyways ) , the regulations essentially say that you can not let illegals pass into the * next * country . 
  which puts the blame on all countries these people came through , not us . 
  the only thing we are to blame for in this regard is letting around 70,000 people pass northwards without registering them . 
  at the point that statement was made , we already were not enforcing dublin anymore . 
  due to various reasons . 
  hungary declared that they would not take back people anymore and courts ruled that it was illegal to send people back to greece due to inhumane conditions for refugees over there . 
  the `` statement '' was a tweet from a ministry , not from the government . 
  the government said that the tweet was inaccurate by the way . 
  [ i have actually written a long-ass post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) about this exact issue . 
  your claim has little substance . 
  but hey , who cares about facts when you can blame germany ? 
  i am not . 
  i simply do not believe in propaganda . 
  well , source that . 
  we did not decide for anybody to `` abandon border regulations '' .
