  sit there until you are trapped between shells of both parties ? 
  thank you . 
  that actually sounds like a good idea that will actually do something to help both greece and the refugees . 
  what about the case where you cant identify yourself with either side ? 
  i can imagine that many syrians are split on the issue . 
  assad is shit and nobody knows what the fsa wants besides getting rid of assad . 
  you dont want to end up giving up your life for something you dont even identify with . 
  ` unfortunately ' the time of symmetrical conflicts is over , where you were ` just ' defending your country against invaders from another country . 
  can you link me a source on that ? 
  some of the biggest advancements in rocket techonology or aviation have been made during ww2 . 
  however thats science payed with human lifes . 
  you are not talking about the european countries here however . 
  go ahead , make a suggestion for a country that is willing and capable of taking in refugees in return for money while also being a safe place . 
  this is like the least we can do . 
  italy and greece need money channeled for dealing with refugees . 
  a few ships alone wont help them improve these conditions . 
  i dont really want to go into that topic . 
  the rise of the nsdap was supported by circumstances that were partly due to the treaty of versailles , however in no way caused by it . 
  the financial crisis caused unemployment everywhere , not just in germany . 
  germany was simply not fit for democracy at that point and the political actors played into hitlers hand . 
  also , pretty much everybody realized that versailles was a bad idea until ww2 , the allies \u00b4 way of dealing with germany after ww2 was a lot more intelligent . 
  however is there really a solution for it ? 
  i guess all we can do is wait for fall where greece holds elections and its first review for the third bailout will be due and refugee numbers will start decreasing over worse weather conditions . 
  the nsdap got its power amids an economic crisis that changed the life of a majority of germans into shit . 
  nothing of this kind is happening right now . 
  yes , we have a lot of asylum seekers , but the general quality of life has yet to decrease . 
  i live two streets from two asylum homes and it is still a very decent area to live without crime or rubbish on the streets . 
  the economy is not expected to cool down that much ( well , lets see how china develops ) , wages are increasing more than in a decade , record levels of employment . 
  there arent any conditions worse for a radical party . 
  how so ? 
  the list i gave you was not conclusive . 
  there are a lot of countries with asylum requests to germany that have numbers a lot lower , but in total more people come from these countries than from syria . 
  i think it is possible that a majority of the * accepted * asylum seekers has syrian origin though . 
  tagging these posts and offering a filter would already be sufficient i think . 
  the nazi card doesnt really work here though . 
  yes , the people burning down the asylum homes are very likely nazis . 
  however the sharp contrast to '33 is that they neither have support of the population nor a party that would sympathize with them . 
  even our npd , which is somewhat the successor of the nsdap , our nazi party , spoke out against the violence and arson attacks . 
  i would actually argue that the share of people from kosovo will remain constant for at least a few months . 
  i think that syria will be # 1 country of origin , but still below 50 % . 
   and then send them back to the port of origin as this port is likely in libya ( where there is some kind of civil war ongoing ) this violates the echr , the unchr and probably the fundamental rights of the countries sending back ( if they have some written in their constitution ) . 
  [ data for q1 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/bd/five_main_citizenships_of_first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_1st_quarter_2015.png ) by country of origin . 
  [ data for 07/2014 -06 / 2015 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00189&amp;plugin=1 ) considering your ( estimated ) question : yes , austria takes in a lot more refugees than germany in relation to population . 
  i am still amazed that people would actually build stuff of this kind . 
  after a few shots , the accuracy went down to 1 km from target point . 
  it just says macedonia , nothing about them being ` syrian ' . 
  why are you posting 70 year old german propaganda videos about ineffective and overly expensive artillery ? 
  roughly 200k in the first half of the year , around 90k in july and august so far if i remember correctly . 
  nobody is replaced . 
  where do you read that ? 
  i cant read it anywhere in the video . 
  nope . 
  the share of syrians has been about 20 % in q1 +2 this year . 
  not if we are talking about greece or italy . 
  both countries have proven to be incapable of offering humane conditions to refugees . 
  their authorities are incapable of dealing with the refugees , some of the shelters lack even basic human needs like running water or electricity . 
  even the supply of food and medicals is not sufficient . 
  this is recognized by most courts in europe , who do not even deport people back to these countries based on basel as they call it ` inhumane ' . 
  you can not blame anybody for not wanting to stay under these conditions , especially considering that these people will likely stay here for years to come as there is no end to the syrian civil war in sight . 
  also , greece already has enough troubles employing its own population , there is pretty much no chance of refugees finding any employment there . 
  syrias neighboring countries have taken in numbers of refugees that are beyond good and evil . 
  lebanon has taken in so many refugees that 25 % of its population are refugees nowadays . 
  800k is the estimate for refugee applications to germany in * total * . 
  one third of these are from kosovo and neighboring countries without any chance of success . 
  we certainly are . 
  and thats okay and only natural i guess . 
  its certainly not the most pleasant thing , but i would prefer this sub to be spammed with threads about the threats europe is facing under german leadership rather than all this immigration spam . 
  it depends on the principle you are following . 
  if you think that a tree with a foul root only produces foul fruits , then it is correct . 
  the large share ` reasonable ' ( or moderate ) voices seems to have departed from these threads . 
  and i can understand every single one of them . 
  either you are getting downvoted for being vocal about disagreeing with some far-right nuts or you are talking against a wall . 
  in all the follow-up comments , you will be met by the same bullshit over and over again : * `` they are no * real * refugees , they passed through safe countries . '', 
  * `` these people should have stayed in their neighboring countries '' * `` these people should have stayed and fought for their country '' * `` europe is on the verge of collapse '' * `` actually these people from syria are just economic migrants '' it really stops being even the slightest fun after some time and it also wastes a lot of time if you are reading the same stuff over and over again ( and even more if you are dumb enough , like me , to try taking these people seriously and reply to them ) . 
  the brits here are generally not very pro-immigration , however they are usually not the ones that strike me as far-right . 
  khodorkovsky is not the person suing however . 
  he sold all his shares of yukos . 
  [ here is a fact sheet about the isds cases of yukos owners v. russia ] ( http://www.iisd.org/itn/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/iisd_itn_yukos_sept_2014_1.pdf ), 
  they gave up on it . 
  i cant understand what you want to say with this post though ? 
  k\u00f6nigsberg has 0.6 % germans , so some might still speak it . 
  the german sudetenland dialects are almost extinct . 
  most german people either fled silesia or were forced to leave . 
  so i think its safe to say that some few people might still speak it , but its essentially a thing of the past . 
  this does not make my point less valid ? 
  are these guys even syrian ? 
  how so ? 
  stop fooling with me . 
  i already explained everything in a manner that should be understandable for everybody . 
  whether you like it or not , this is the state of it . 
  i dont even know if i should continue this discussion , because you are obviously not willing/capable to understand it . 
  by eu law , all eu citizens have to be treated the same way . 
  the german government is free to introduce a toll on their road and they are also free to raise or lower the taxes whenever they want . 
  just if they do it in exact the amount of the toll and at the same time while having said in their election campaign that they want a `` toll just for foreigners '' , it violates eu law as it is obviously just a way trying to bypass eu law . 
  they would essentially want to send a toll sticker to every german for free while foreigners will have to pay for it . 
  this is just not running . 
  the second way is * very obviously * putting other eu citizens at a disadvantage , the other variant is doing the same , but indirectly , as the other people wont be relieved off their taxes . 
  so they can introduce a toll for everyone and lower the car taxes by a certain amount last year * unless * it is clearly just meant to compensate the germans for the car tax . 
  bonn has 317,000 inhabitants , m\u00fcnster has 300,000 aswell . 
  it makes quite a lot of sense .
