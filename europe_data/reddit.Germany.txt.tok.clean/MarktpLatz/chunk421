  what could * possibly * go wrong with that ? 
  seriously ? 
  additionally , your reasoning is faulty . 
  these conventions are no contracts where two sides are involved and if one fails to do their part , the other side does n't have to keep its promises either . 
  this is goddamn * law * and these are goddamn * conventions * . 
   yes they are . 
  politicians , especially on the left , get all teary eyed and protest whenever we try to deport people back to their now safe countries . 
  it 's fucking insanity . 
  those who have learned the language and made a real effort to integrate and are contributing positively to society should be allowed to stay . 
  the rest can rebuild their countries like the europeans did after wwi and wwii . 
  what matters is not the opposition but the government however . 
  you can have people cry as much as they want , they are not the ones making the decisions at the moment . 
   because they saw poor people on tv and being in favor of opening the border made them feel good . 
  the reasoning does not matter . 
   she should have know what would happen and limit the refugee stream how ? 
   thanks to merkel we 've taken almost a million and public opinion has turned around , taking away the public backing for necessary integration efforts ( and spending ) . 
  public backing for integration and integration spending is still there . 
  there was n't a lot of complaining about our current spending . 
   she couldnt have failed much harder . 
  oh , she could have . 
  despite all the talk , germany is still in excellent condition . 
  i agree on deporting the troublemakers . 
  deporting people because they are `` young men '' does not make sense however - we can not and will not deport into war areas . 
   this is the most farcical of all . 
  you could have helped several times the numbe if you had helped increasing the humanitarian situation in camps . 
  easily . 
  helping people here and helping people in the region is not mutually exclusive . 
  and by the way , criticizing germany in this regard is n't really due - we are one of the few countries that actually spends significant amounts of money in the region . 
  germany , the uk and norway provided over 50 % of the last pledging conference for syrian refugees . 
  the countries that complain the most about how spending in the region would be more efficient are usually the ones doing the least . 
  both here in europe and in terms of funding . 
   that is true to an extent . 
  failing to protect a border is more failure of will though . 
  we do not have a responsibility to protect inner-eu borders however . 
  doing so would significantly cripple our economy and it is the wrong thing to do . 
   austria was just as stupid or even more so . 
  does n't change the fact that it was part of our reasoning . 
  sorry , i can not really help you with that . 
  however , i can tell you that spamming and self-promotion is against the reddit-wide rules . 
   it does not change the fact that politicians love to play the `` refugees make economic sense '' card . 
  you ignore that this rhetoric only came up * after * we allowed in refugees . 
  therefore , calling it the `` reasoning '' is misled . 
   every asylum seeker should and must apply for asylum in the first safe country . 
  so much for theory , what about reality ? 
  if you can not deport them to the first safe country , you do not really have an option . 
  we could not deport people to syria , lebanon , turkey or greece . 
   rejected claims must be returned asap , and their country of origin should accept them in accordance with international law . 
  this however is not our fault - the main obstacle is always the country of origin . 
  we have no way to force them to accept people as they are souvereign countries . 
   secondly , they must return once the country the fled from is safe again , unless a long time has gone by ( 3-5 is not enough , the limit should be closer to 10 years ) . 
  nobody is contesting that . 
  however , we should keep those that make a positive contribution to our society and economy . 
  not really . 
  it is n't particularly high quality and it seems that you are only posting videos from that channel ( which probably is your own ) . 
  this is a big no-no . 
  people forget that 70 % of germans were in favour of `` opening the border '' when it happened .

  show me a source confirming that the reason why germany let in refugees in the first place was the desire for high-skilled labour force . 
  the idea that some of the refugees are highly educated was spread * after * these people were already in germany . 
  the idea that they could help our demographic problems became popular * after * the people were already coming here in large numbers . 
  humanitarian reasons 2 . 
  failure of eu law 3 . 
  helping other eu countries - mainly yours and hungary . 
  additionally , eu legislation on refugees and the german constitution plus german law in this case .

  this however was n't the reasoning . 
  so your comment is little more than an elaborate shitpost . 
  not necessarily . 
  it is not unprecedented that it takes time to integrate refugees into the labour market . 
  the aim seems to be 50 % employment after five years . 
  who says that ? 
  source ?

   should we hold providers like telecom responsible for transmitting `` offensive '' content from the internet to the home pc or smart phone ? 
  this comparison is nonsense . 
   i 'm against the idea of any `` criminal code '' that tells people what kind of speech is or is not acceptable . 
  this is not your decision however . 
  the opinion of an irishman on this does not and should not matter to the legal reality in germany . 
   which were drafted with things like mass rallies in mind , to punish those who would incite lynch mobs . 
  nope . 
  it was created with all kinds of public statements in mind . 
  does n't matter if you talk on a private conference , on television , in a newspaper article or on a rally . 
  the internet is not different . 
   it was not the idea to have a political officer in every pub , but since the internet is `` mass media '' ( even if you have like 10 followers ) , the law as it applies makes you criminal if you demand the gassing of jews . 
  and it is n't the idea now either . 
   what should be happen is the decriminalization of people yelling on the internet , but this wo n't happen , since once the tools of censorship are in place , i bet every inconvenient news article will start too look like a nail , because `` muh russian hackers . '', 
  that 's a polticial decision which i oppose and which does n't comply with our constitution . 
  removed .
