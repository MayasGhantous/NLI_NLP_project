  while i could get behind your line of thought , this is not how it works , not how it should work and not how it can work . 
  facebook is not a government actor , they do not have any obligation to allow `` free speech '' on their platform . 
  if they choose to do so , very well , but they can remove whatever content they do not like . 
  therefore , complaining about facebook deleting stuff in general is n't due . 
  i can totally understand being upset by facebooks policies in this regard and i feel like they have a lot to improve on here . 
  demanding that they do not delete posts that are not against the law would not work , is not in accordance with the laws and also misjudges facebooks position and nature . 
  secondly , demanding that all deletions are done by judges is idiotic . 
  do you know that facebook employs hundreds of people moderating reported posts ? 
  many of them are very clear-cut decisions , but a lot of them are borderline . 
  you simply can not employ highly payed and highly educated judges to do that . 
  apart from that : judges are not and should not be employed by facebook . 
  nor should it be their responsibility to decide on which comment is removed and which comment stays . 
  this is very much up to facebook and this is how it should stay . 
  the only cases where judges need to be involved is when laws are actually violated . 
  and finding posts that violate the law is not the responsibility of a judge anyways . 
  in case you missed it : this is not about new laws , this is about applying the existing laws .

  the survey will probably stay online for another week so that everyone gets their chance to take part . 
  afterwards we need to transfer the results into a thread that looks pretty , unlike the raw database that contains the results right now . 
  i 'm afraid this wo n't be before new year .

  we do not allow selfposts about articles . 
  afaik the u.k. is an island on reddit as well - / r/europe is n't a default over there . 
  or at least that 's how it used to be . 
  i know  but who needs shelter when you are stronk yourself ? 
  no need . 
  current top 3 : 1 . 
  germany 2 . 
  u.k. 3 . 
  netherlands, 
  spoiler alert : according to the temporary results of the current survey , germans are actually # 1 . 
  glorious deutschland can into dominance !, 
   the data reveals that without migrants considered , crime rates in germany would have remained roughly static since 2014 . 
  but , in fact , the country recorded an extra 402,741 crimes committed by migrants . 
  misleading . 
  the crime rate is still roughly the same - if you take out asylum-related offences . 
  which is the appropriate thing to do given that these `` crimes '' do not do harm to anyone . 
   according to the report , most of the crimes were committed by migrants from : syria ( 24 % ) , albania ( 17 % ) , kosovo ( 14 % ) , serbia ( 11 % ) , afghanistan ( 11 % ) , iraq ( 9 % ) , eritrea ( 4 % ) , macedonia ( 4 % ) , pakistan ( 4 % ) and nigeria ( 2 % ) . 
  this is misleading as well . 
  these are just the share of these nationalities amongst crimes committed by asylum seekers . 
  using the word `` migrant '' here is completely wrong . 
  even if you want to think that these people are no legitimate refugees , this term is wrong as it also covers other people which are not registered in this stat . 
  and given that syrians are making up way over 30 % of refugees , they are actually * underrepresented * in this statistic . 
   in addition , in 2015 , migrants were involved in 36,010 reported cases of assault , battery and robbery ( rohheitsdelikte : k\u00f6rperverletzung , raub , r\u00e4uberische erpressung ) , roughly twice as many as in 2014 ( 18,678 ) . 
  there were also , in 2015 , 28,712 reported incidents of fare evasion on public transportation ( bef\u00f6rderungserschleichung ) . 
  again , the term is misleading . 
  you also fail to see this : there was an effective increase of 80 % in crime committed by asylum seekers - however at the same time the number of asylum seekers increased by 440 % - this equates decreasing crime rate . 
   and of migrant crimes specifically , syrians top the list of migrant crimes that are not related to border controls , with a total of 10,348 individual offences in 2015 . 
  they also led assault cases among migrants , with 3,186 offences in 2015 . 
  * asylum seeker crimes * for fucks sake . 
  raw numbers do n't tell you much unless you give a percentage . 
  i guess the syrian share is below their share of asylum seekers again . 
   illegal immigrants and asylum seekers account for around 2.5 per cent of germany 's population , but were also massively overrepresented . 
  some numbers would be nice . 
  -- -- -- there are a lot more faults in your claims . 
  you are either incapable or unwilling to stay with the facts here . 
  you are misinterpreting the stats to match your personal bias/message . 
  i would write more , but i have to leave right now . 
  it really is n't . 
  the point of a deployment , no matter the size , is that an attack on poland automatically becomes an attack on nato troops .
