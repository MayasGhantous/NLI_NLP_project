   woman 's hour publishes a power list every year , with a different theme each time . 
  this was the first year where dead women or those from outside the uk were considered . 
   in deciding on the final seven names , the judges ** `` considered a woman 's body of work or her role as a catalyst for change over the past 70 years , as well as those having an impact today '' ** , a representative for the programme said . 
   barnett said : `` the list takes in a range of experiences across a range of ages . 
  we hope the list inspires , educates and crucially shines a light on the work of some women who history may already be starting to forget . '',

  that 's not limited to people of muslim faith . 
  generally speaking , the more religious a person ( no matter the faith ) , the more kids . 
  as for how they are affected - there are actually studies that suggest that birth rates adapt rather quickly . 
  second generation immigrants already have a birth rate closer to the `` native '' birth rate of that country than to the birth rate of their parents .

   if you do n't have a way to punish the people responsible , do n't punish anyone . 
  this `` punishment '' is not throwing insane amounts of money into a barrel without ground . 
  this `` punishment '' meant cutting ballooned public sector wages and pensions . 
  just fyi - the wages in these sectors grew much faster than in any other european country . 
   not being ` politically feasible ' is not an excuse . 
  it is . 
  if you want to see the tools available , you will have to concentrate on the ones you can actually use . 
   is to give it sufficient money so it can actually breath and grow . 
  and where should this money come from ? 
   if that is n't ` politically possible ' then the eurozone is truly destined for collapse because a monetary union requires support given from richer nations to poorer , struggling ones . 
  carrot and stick was the appropriate way of dealing with greece for now . 
  they have proven that they are incapable of reforming themselves without pressure . 
  it 's sad , but that 's the reality . 
  we can talk about fiscal transfers in the long term , but that is not a fix for greeces current problems . 
  we by the way have suggested fiscal transfers years ago - under the condition that there is strict supervision over that money . 
  something that greece fundamentally opposed . 
   and it 's not right to blame a population for a government 's failings . 
  voters are almost always going to vote for the politician that promises them the most , it is the duty of politicians to make realistic and honest promises . 
  that is how representative democracy is supposed to work . 
  you can not take any responsibility away from the voter . 
  if the voter falls for the promises , its the voters fault . 
  simple as that . 
  in a democracy , the voters are the most powerful force - politicans are only the `` employees '' of the voter . 
  what you are doing is like suggesting that the people who voted hitler into power should not be blamed . 
   you can blame labour laws or whatever but , the primary cause is a lack of growth . 
  before the crisis , unemployment was well under 10 % in greece showing it 's perfectly possible to maintain adequate employment rates in greece , you just need economic growth and not collapse , to maintain them .
