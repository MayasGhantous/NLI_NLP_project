  i have not said that . 
   no , it obviously was n't . 
  i mean , of course every country knew what was on paper . 
  not gon na argue that , but that 's kinda obvious . 
  thing is , the outcome was not clear for everyone since it ended where it ended . 
  i 'm quite sure greeks or italians would n't join ez if it could be predicted how markets are going to collapse . 
  collapsing markets are one thing , being a general misfit for a system is quite another . 
  and no , i think the outcome was predictable . 
  we have seen how other countries struggled to keep up with the deutschmark during the ems regime . 
  unless the countries made serious efforts to reform , the same would happen in the euro , just to a more severe degree . 
  and they did n't and it did . 
   yeah , except when they finally relented to allow qe ? 
  that was also supposed to be `` non-negotiable '' until the point where it was only choice . 
  qe is still a tool that is appropriate to achieve the ecb 's main goal - price stability . 
  the ecb has the duty to keep inflation up , and qe is seen as the appropriate tool for that by central banks around the world . 
  the fact that it devalues the currency and indirectly helps southern european coutnries is only secondary . 
   either ez will undergo serious change or something will snap and fallout will be much bigger than just greece losing 30 % gdp . 
  mistakes were made and need to be acknowledged by creators , that 's the only way forward . 
  the changes the ez needs are political . 
  the changes required are not related to the ecb - quite the contrary , they are required in ways so that the ecb needs to interfere * less * . 
  the countries need to do the homework themselves . 
  internal monetary transfers in the european union , which we are not opposed to under conditions by the way , do not affect central bank policy . 
  no it is n't . 
  it is essentially just saying that countries will have to adapt or leave . 
  no state is incapable of reform , what matters is the will to reform . 
  if you live beyond your means , you will have to fix things . 
  devaluating your currency only disguises these problems and expropriates the populace at the same time . 
  you make it sound like a default would be some kind of sunshine scenario . 
  hint : it is n't . 
  italys banks do need recapitalization , but under current rules it will be very difficult for the italian government to provide that money . 
  i do not see how you can make this connection with the troika . 
  your arguments are all over the place and not coherent . 
  since then , the rules were changed . 
  this does n't change a thing about italy 's current situation . 
  this is how the german central bank has worked forever 2 . 
  this was clear to anybody that joined the euro 3 . 
  germany will never accept changes to this principle, 
  this does n't even make sense . 
  we are not forcing anyone to prop up their banks with public money - we are doing the opposite . 
  you are contradicting yourself . 
  you are aware of the bail-in clauses agreed upon by the ez countries ? 
  uhm . 
  wot ? 
  you underestimate how many imported goods people buy . 
  all of which would get much more expensive . 
  it is widely assumed that it would lead to recession by economists . 
  long-term you might be better off , but short term you certainly wo n't . 
  i do care because the economies of the current day are very interconnected . 
  if you struggle , it will create problems for other countries as well . 
  well , enjoy your savings being wiped out in a matter of months and an even more severe recession then . 
  they are still outspending pretty much anybody . 
  they spend more on r&d than any other carmaker ( including toyota ) and more than the tech giants ( apple , google etc. ) . 
  r&d spending is around 13 or 14 billions at the moment iirc . 
  and they have announced to maintain that level of spending in this area despite the crisis . 
  we used to have a nation-wide monopoly . 
  when we privatized the lines , we forced the successor company ( the telekom ) to grant access to any competitor . 
  i do not know about the fees however .

  interesting , thanks !, 
   i know , i know , the untouchable constitution . 
  that is actually irrelevant to my point . 
   great , now it 'll just be a few ten or hundred thousands per year again , so the population replacement will still happen , just at a slower pace . 
  problem solved i guess ... a vast majority of germans is fine with a few ten or hundred thousands a year . 
  there also is no `` replacement '' . 
  nobody is being replaced by another person .
