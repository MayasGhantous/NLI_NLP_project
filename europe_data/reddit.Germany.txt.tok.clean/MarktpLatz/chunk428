  unless you can provide a source confirming your claim , this is just baseless speculation . 
  there is probably a difference between people who emigrate for whatever reason and then use the opportunity to home school and people who go to court in germany because of it or leave the country for the sole reason of homeschooling . 
  every single case that has made it into the media has been because of religious reasons iirc . 
  of course it was her parents , but the fact that `` the girl is arguing '' is of legal nature . 
  violations of fundamental rights can only be brought to court by the people that are directly affected . 
  and this is the girl in this case . 
  since she is too young however , her parents have the right to take this to court in her name . 
  there have been cases where toddlers were `` bringing cases '' to the court . 
  well , source that . 
  from what i know , slightly over half of the muslims polled say that to them , sharia law is more important than the regular laws . 
  there however is little support for introducing the sharia as official law in the country , and even a vast majority of the minority that wants this law to apply here say that it should only apply to muslims . 
  it is possible to accept the limitations set out in the sharia without it having any effect on german law by the way . 
  it only gets problematic when people actually try to enforce that `` law '' against others . 
  since this wo n't happen , `` as soon '' means never . 
  and by the way - most of our muslims are pretty moderate and have no problem with our liberal laws . 
  some parts of our constitution can not be changed by the way . 
  unlikely . 
  not really . 
  the incidents where this happens are pretty rare , they just happen to get a lot of attention in the media . 
  most muslim girls attend these classes in regular swimming gear . 
  yeah . 
  we have these people occasionally . 
  most of them are going to france , some to the uk . 
  there even was one family who applied for asylum in the usa due to this . 
  i am pretty happy with our laws in this regard though . 
  i simply do not see the advantage in homeschooling - the people that leave germany because of it tend to be religious fundamentalists that do not want that their children are taught about evolution . 
  edit : a word, 
  that 's actually or biggest swimming-related problem with the refugees . 
  sexual harassment in public pools barely ever happens , the main issue is that many of them do not know how to swim . 
  we had over a dozen deaths due to this in 2016 . 
  wrong history is n't a legitimate belief . 
  in fact , it really is n't open to interpretation . 
  it is in most of germany as far as i know . 
  homeschooling is illegal over here . 
  attending a `` real '' school is mandatory until 9th grade . 
  they are unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from being able to swim . 
  at least we do n't have wigs anymore .

  the `` lol '' part was directed at the `` deleting their own posts '' part of parent . 
  and no , i stand by my assessment that the case is overblown . 
  this was actually just additional information and not the removal reason . 
  the reason is the fact that it is a self-post .

  i would say : not at all . 
  this rule was only focussed on the law change for turks . 
  they are free to get dual citizenship while they are in the eu , afterwards it will become problematic .

   2 hours ago by : stefan wagstyl in berlin  angela merkel suffered a shock defeat at the hands of her christian democrat party on wednesday when its annual conference voted to limit many immigrants ' rights to dual citizenship , a privilege granted only two years ago . 
   the decision , which mainly concerns germany 's large turkish-origin community , highlights continuing deep unease in the cdu over the chancellor 's liberal immigration policies despite her efforts to move on from the migrant crisis in which more than 1m asylum seekers arrived in germany in the year to march 2016 . 
   the vote , passed in defiance of the party leadership , shows that the cdu rank and file remains in a truculent mood even though members on tuesday overwhelmingly backed ms merkel 's bid to remain party leader , endorsing her plan to run for a fourth term as chancellor in next year 's parliamentary poll . 
   `` that 's the party conference for you , '' said julia kl\u00f6ckner , a cdu deputy chairman , speaking on the margins of the event in the industrial city of essen . 
   the motion was proposed by the cdu youth wing , which has a tradition of trying to push the party to the right and has been particularly critical of ms merkel 's refugee policies . 
  it was opposed by speakers including thomas de maizi\u00e8re , interior minister , and peter tauber , cdu general secretary , who are close to ms merkel . 
  although the vote passed by only a narrow margin of 319 to 300 , with many of the 1,001 delegates absent , young union members cheered the result . 
   before 2014 , the cdu and the csu , its bavaria-based sister , opposed dual citizenship on the grounds that immigrant-origin people should not be allowed to divide their loyalties , and defended a system under which young people of foreign-origin had to choose between german and foreign citizenship between the ages of 18 and 24 . 
   however two years ago the conservatives reluctantly agreed to a compromise with the social democrats , the junior coalition partners , who had long campaigned for dual rights . 
  under the new law , children of foreign parents born and raised in germany can claim dual citizenship . 
  but the refugee crisis has polarised germany and pushed many conservatives to call for tougher rules for integrating migrants . 
   after the vote , ms merkel rejected the result saying it would have no effect on government decisions . 
  the agreement with the spd would remain in place . 
   mr de maizi\u00e8re said it would not alter the legal position because the cdu/csu bloc lacked an absolute majority in the bundestag and would not find any partners for a rule change . 
   but the social democrats warned that the vote would antagonise immigrant communities , not least the turkish-origin population of around 3m , half of whom are turkish citizens . 
  `` this is a slap in the face for the integration of young people who have already lived here a long time , '' said thomas oppermann , the spd parliamentary chief . 
  `` the chancellor asks her party for help and instead gets a spoke between her wheels . ''  cem \u00d6zdemir , leader of the opposition green party and germany 's most senior turkish-origin politician , said the decision could `` marginalise '' german-turks and `` surrender '' them to the `` authoritarian master '' , recep tayyip erdogan , the turkish president . 
   mr \u00d6zdemir 's concerns are based on the fact the 1.5 m turkish citizens living in germany already show considerable sympathy for mr erdogan : his akp party won more than 60 per cent of the vote in germany in last year 's turkish parliamentary elections . 
  mr erdogan 's crackdown after this summer 's failed putsch has further boosted his support base in germany , even as it has created splits in the community prompting criticism from anti-erdogan turks in germany . 
   turkish community leaders warned that a return to the old citizenship law would be discriminatory , as it would only apply , as before , to the children of immigrants from outside the eu . 
  under eu law , eu citizens and their offspring have long enjoyed easy access to dual citizenship . 
  it is your best shot if you want to have a discussion on this topic . 
  unfortunately , we do not tolerate self-posts unless they are of very high quality . 
  the issue of the british press has been discussed multiple times in the last days , there was a guardian article about it and also some other submissions . 
  i am sorry , but i simply can not approve your post .
