  if you would have the decency to read the rules before complaining , you would notice that we do not have `` local news '' as a rule , only `` local crime '' .

  i am 100 % convinced that the call was correct . 
  and so is the rest of the mod team . 
  no point in arguing about that .

  we do n't have results . 
  we unfortunately experienced some technical issues and took it offline until that is fixed . 
  it will be up again soon . 
  what are you even on about ? 
  you do not have the numbers confirming your opinion so you go with individual crimes instead ? 
  that 's kind of pathetic . 
  thanks !, 
  for political decisions , this does not matter whatsoever . 
  and it should n't . 
  what matters is crime rate , not a total number . 
  and the crime rate has stayed the same or in fact decreased . 
  i am not more likely to become a victim of a crime today than i was ten years ago . 
  everywhere or in certain areas ? 
  this is exactly the type of content the users are here for , mate !, 
  650 mord 1,448 totschlag 746 fahrl\u00e4ssige t\u00f6tung ( ohne verkehrsdelikte ) [ here 's the link if you are interested ] ( https://www.bka.de/de/aktuelleinformationen/statistikenlagebilder/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/pks2015/pks2015_node.html ) . 
  pks 2015 - jahrbuch is what you are looking for . 
  i took a closer look at the official police report : we had 650 cases of murder in 2015 ; 1,448 cases of manslaugther ; 746 cases of negligent homicide . 
  it seems that your list exclusively focusses on the `` murder '' cases and ignores that manslaughter in germany still involves intent . 
  your statistic does n't include negligent homicide . 
  federal police crime statistic for 2015 : 2,116 cases of homicide ( 2,179 in 2014 ) . 
  it might have something to do with the fact that we tend to define `` murder '' and `` menslaughter '' in a different way than most other countries . 
  ... whatever that is .

  no problem !, 
  it makes a lot of sense to exclude them - they do not do any harm to anyone in the country . 
  it is a different person if someone important is the direct victim . 
  if merkel died , it would be reported no matter the circumstances . 
  we are simply enforcing the rules . 
  and if it comforts you , we are doing so in `` both '' directions . 
  no poltiical bias involved here . 
  as i have written elsewhere , the person of the father is completely unrelated the crime . 
  it would be a different issue if she was targeted due to the persona of her father , but this is n't the case . 
  breakdown for 2013 : 102,666 violations of residency law , asylum law and crimes against the freedom of movement ( eu ) in total : * 34,089 illegal entry * 2,558 human trafficking * 5,500 illegal procurement of a residence permit * 288 professional human trafficking * 2,302 violations of asylum processing law * 56,171 violations of assigned residence areas ( as an asylum seeker , your freedom of movement can be limit , in some federal states you are not allowed to leave the near area/the state/etc . ), 
  * 260 entry or residence despite lacking the right of european freedom of movement, 
  im afraid no . 
  the only thing that gets published on a half-year basis is politically motivated crime . 
  sorry , but this is just nonsense . 
  looking at individual cases does n't get us anywhere . 
  the only thing that matters is the bigger picture . 
  well , how ? 
  2016 is n't finished yet . 
  the national crime statistic is published in may , so we will have to wait a bit until we get numbers for this year . 
  let 's look at some older data though : 2013 -  2014 saw an increase of 2 % ; ~ 1.3 % if you take out the increase in asylum-related offences . 
  2012 -  2013 saw a decline of 0.6 % ; -1 % if you take out the increase in alsylum-related offences . 
  2011 -  2012 saw an increase of 0.1 % , the change turns negative when you do not account for the increase in asylum-related offences . 
  -- -- -- to have a look at the total numbers : as i stated above , the total number of crimes ( without asylum-related offences ) was 5,927,908 in 2015 . 
  the number was 5,912,355 in 2011 . 
  this means a total change of 0.26 % over four years . 
  in the same time , our population increased by more than 1 % - meaning a negative change in crime rate . 
  this does not confirm parents point however . 
  parent said that there was an increase in crime rate - this is wrong . 
  the crime rate actually decreased due to fact that the population increased while the number of crimes stayed the same . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  the ard was the only part of the media that did n't report about it . 
  and in my opinion rightfully so . 
  the `` mainstream media '' reported about it . 
  not on the first page , but they did . 
  immediately after the press conference in freiburg . 
  100 % agreed .
