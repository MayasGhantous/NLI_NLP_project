  lol . 
  i still think that this case here is terribly overblown . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm curious about the 2016 numbers however . 
  it was removed because it was a local crime until it became a political issue . 
  well , it became political because people * wanted * it to become political . 
  it was a bit forced tbh . 
  this is irrelevant however . 
  the crime was not committed due to who her father was . 
  it would n't have made a difference if her father was a homeless beggar or santa claus . 
  i was actually talking about a general ban in the public . 
  in banks , courts etc. 
  it is perfectly fine . 
  i would call it `` minor '' as it is rather common . 
  we have around 2100 killings a year in germany . 
  thats over 5 a day . 
  good joke mate . 
  i expected a response like this . 
   migrants committed 208,344 crimes in 2015 , according to a confidential police report that was leaked to the german newspaper , bild . 
  this figure represents an 80 % increase over 2014 and works out to around 570 crimes committed by migrants every day , or 23 crimes each hour , between january and december 2015 . 
  the increase was 80 % despite the fact that the number of refugees increased by around 440 % in the same time . 
  this speaks * against * an increasing crime rate . 
  gatestone is misinterpreting the results by the way . 
   migrants linked to 69,000 would-be or actual crimes in germany in first three months of 2016 : police this ... does n't indicate an increase in crime rate ? 
  what matters is the statistic : [ police crime statistic 2015 ] ( https://www.bka.de/de/aktuelleinformationen/statistikenlagebilder/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/pks2015/pks2015_node.html ) ( in german ) * crimes total in 2015 : 6,330,649 * crimes total in 2014 : 6,082,064 increase : 4.1 % if you take out asylum-related crimes however ( residency , border crossing etc. 
  ) : * 2015 : 5,927,908 * 2014 : 5,925,668 increase : 2,240 crimes in the whole of germany or 0,0 % . 
  well , present me a source . 
  despite the influx of refugees , the number of crimes changed by 0.0 % 2014 -  2015 . 
  german national newspapers commented about it . 
  i do not see no reason to talk about censorship here . 
  and i agree with the decision of our most important news show not reporting on it prior to it becoming a political issue . 
  it is a rape with murder . 
  this stuff happens , unfortunately .

  a regular , unaffected citizen can not appeal here however . 
  there are several ways how this law can end up in front of the bverfg : 1 . 
  government enacts law , opposition takes it to court . 
  government enacts law , burqa-wearing woman is affected and takes it to the court because of a violation of her fundamental right of freedom of religion . 
  in either of these cases , if the court decides * against * the ban , there wo n't be an appeal . 
  there could only be an appeal if the woman loses the case and takes it to the ecthr . 
  some random rightwinger can not appeal against the judgement as he is n't affected himself . 
  our constitutional court considers itself to be superior to any other court . 
  this includes the ecj/ecthr ( echr is the abbrevation for the convention , not for the court ) . 
  the bverfg considers these courts to be of the grace of the bverfg . 
  it has n't openly dissented with these courts , but it reserves the right to do so . 
  the ecthr has a different scope than our constitutional court . 
  our fundamental rights go beyond those guaranteed in the echr in certain areas . 
  it is always possible to be `` more liberal '' than the ecthr . 
  you can always give more freedom to people than written in the echr . 
  we are not bound to limit rights to the maximum legally possible extent . 
  someone would have to go to the ecthr against this in the first place . 
  if the bverfg rules against a ban , nobody in their right mind would take this to an eu court . 
  the only way this ends up at an eu court would be if the bverfg would decide to uphold such a ban .

   seriously , russia with all its might should get its acts together . 
  well , lets see what they do with their next carrier that will probably be built soon . 
  putting significant amounts of money into the kuszenov would be a waste in my opinion . 
  well , `` even '' . 
  the french are probably operating the most capable non-us carrier .

  good news !, 
  some background : * the foundation for this debt relief has been layed in may * the repayment periods for the loans in the second memorandum will be increased from 28 to 32 years * greece shall profit from the very low interest levels currently available . 
  the esm will use interest rate swaps to accomplish this . 
  * the cost for the other ez partners are around 200 million euros in interest payments * this debt relief was more than athens expected , according to the greek minister of finance , tsakalotos * it remains unclear whether the imf will stay on board . 
  it was announced that it would make a decision in december , but dijseelbloem says that it will be postponed to 2017 . 
  [ source , in german ] ( http://www.dw.com/de/schuldenerleichterungen-f%c3%bcr-griechenland/a-36654276 ), 
   try to learn the language when you decided because , germany for example will be a pain without german . 
  only english will not be enjoyable in the long run . 
  it depends where you go . 
  you can easily make it in berlin by only speaking english . 
  nevertheless , i would argue in favour of learning the local language no matter what - you will never have it easier to get fluent in a language .
