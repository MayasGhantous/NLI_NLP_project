  well , he had , but the only way ( defaulting and exiting the euro ) was against the will of a vast majority of greeks . 
  that 's a bit of a faulty question - the nsdap never reached 50 % prior to converting germany into a dictatorship . 
  but its fair to say that the share of housewifes voting nsdap was pretty close to the total result - [ check page 18/246 ] ( http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2008/9/chapter/hamburgup_schlaglichter_hitler.pdf ) .

  i also only know the general stuff about it - i unfortunately ca n't help you with a link here , i am sorry . 
   so was basically the cdu in germany . 
  lots of old nazis directly migrated to the new system ( because a system needs people to run it ) . 
  regardless of if you think that 's right or wrong , it does n't make todays cdu nazis . 
  here 's the difference . 
  the cdu had nazis in it , yes . 
  but it was n't founded by nazis . 
  its early heads have been opponents of the nazi regime . 
  plus the leading personnel that used to be a member of the nsdap was n't part of the ss * even prior to the war * .

  it does not matter who the father is since it is completely unrelated to the crime 2 . 
  not every story involving an aylum seeker is important . 
  we also remove local crime stories of violence * again * asylum seekers - there is no bias involved here . 
  the cologne attacks were revoved under `` local crime '' as long as the dimensions were n't clear as far as i know . 
  please provide a translation .

  the debt to gdp ratio means shit . 
  it is the most simple of stats when it comes to debt . 
  what matters is that the investors lend money to greece - and they look at sustainability .
