  it should . 
  the reason why people disagree is that they do not understand shit about this issue . 
  this is all fair and good , but unless governments act accordingly , it 's just nice words . 
  what i wrote is 100 % accurate . 
  check the facts . 
  the thing is : we did not help them in their neighboring countries . 
  the camps actually ran out of money for food - like that the fuck ? 
  most european countries hardly spend any money in the region . 
  and it 's very hypocritical - the countries that are the most vocal in `` helping in the region instead of allowing the refugees into europe '' - the v4 amongst others , do * very * little in this regard . 
  the uk , germany and a few others are the ones that are actually doing stuff in this regard .

  syrians do not have that option though . 
  the country has essentially three fractions - and none of them could be described as `` genuienly good '' . 
  because saudi arabia has no asylum system - contrary to the western countries . 
  unlike us , the are not that committed to humanity . 
  true . 
  well , it is not like we have done nothing . 
  the 2015 bailout provides enough money for all debt payments and expenses until mid-2018 . 
  and that bailout was pushed through in germany by merkel and sch\u00e4uble * against * the will of their own party and against the will of the population . 
  unlike in poland during that time , there is no `` good '' side in syria . 
  i can perfectly understand anybody who says that he neither wants to fight for a murdering regime , nor for rebels with dubious background and records of war crimes nor for isis . 
  this option simply was n't there for the poles . 
  unlike in syria , the war did not go on for years ( the initial conquering of poland took about a month ) and there were enemies on both sides of the country . 
  additionally , they did not have a regime dropping bombs on their own citizens . 
  the thing is : no matter how true this is - granting debt relief to greece right now would be political suicide in germany . 
  we have said in the past that we do not consider nominal debt relief but are open to a significant extension of maturities and grace periods ( which essentially is some kind of debt relief ) and we will probably see something alongst these lines * after * the 2017 election .

  well , we can not change that now . 
  unlike you , we do not have thousands of miles of water between us and the origin of the refugees . 
  that 's one way to see it , but claims about increased crime are just false . 
  total . 
  in fact , the total number of crimes remained stable from 2014 -  2015 despite the influx . 
  it also works the other way around . 
  and no , from what i have read , most of the severe crimes ( physical assault etc. ), 
  were against other refugees . 
   and terrorists , dont forget that . 
  terrorists came in with the refugees . 
  the security services of the western nations have said that the terrorists are not relying on refugee streams to get inside our countries . 
   i also doubt the second point . 
  seems highly unlikely looking at the record : https://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted yeah , the interpol `` most wanted '' list surely beats any statistic on crime . 
  like seriously ? 
   do you actually believe that second point ? 
  i have no reason not to . 
   because i would not be surprised if the police are ` no-crimeing ' refugees for political reasons . 
  i mean , they did try to help cover up cologne it did n't work though . 
  additionally , there are nationalities that are overrepresented in the statistics . 
  this did not happen today 2 . 
  surprise , there are criminals amongst asylum seekers . 
  nobody ever claimed that they wo n't commit crimes . 
  what matters is the crime rate - and the crime rate remains unchanged so far . 
  singular cases are not a good argument .
