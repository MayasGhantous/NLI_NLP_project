  it is n't the `` basis '' for that article , it is just additional information . 
  the economist made their own calculations . 
  and since the article already directly links to this ( older ) article , i wo n't approve it , i am sorry . 
  have a nice evening !, 
  the article is from october . 
  removed . 
  sorry , but there is already a post about it on the [ front page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5g2kh7/to_anyone_interested_there_is_a_war_going_on_in/ ) .

  that 's not up to the americans . 
  and it should n't be . 
  this is domestic policy . 
  the us president does n't even have a legal tool to block the sale - he however could shut down the us-based plants of that company .

  if you have the time , read what i wrote [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) . 
  wrong . 
  there were hundreds of thousands of people coming to europe even before germany opened the borders , before merkel said a word . 
  there was no invitation . 
  apart from the fact that you should work on your `` skills '' , this does n't change a thing about our laws . 
  well , depends . 
  if you are importing more anyways , your purchases will be cheaper due to the fact that the euro is strong . 
  if you want to get rid of that trade deficit however , it gets harder , i agree . 
  and no , i simply can not agree with calling it `` unfair '' - they knew what they signed up for . 
   well you do n't know how the erm worked . 
  the countries had no control over their currency anymore , the only one who had was germany , which did n't have to abide to national rules anymore but those of the ecb . 
  this was abundently clear to everybody when they signed up though . 
   you 'd be in spain 's situation right now if it was n't for the euro , if it was n't for us .
