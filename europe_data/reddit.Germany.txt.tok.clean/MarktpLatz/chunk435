  i hope i will find the time to reply to the rest of your comment tomorrow . 
  you fail to see the point . 
  we have a strict policy for the central bank : price stability and nothing else . 
  the german central bank is independent , so no - suggesting that we could or should have devaluated our currency is wrong . 
  you all knew this when you signed up for the ems/euro . 
  and no , we had no such duty . 
  quite the opposite - you had the duty to get your own house clean . 
  our laws only affect neighbors because they let refugees pass through freely . 
  because they failed to secure the external borders . 
  because they did not register them . 
  why should we ? 
  no , they could have valued it correctly in the first place . 
  our monetary policy has always been focused on price stability and not on politics .

  well yeah , city centre . 
   yes . 
  we were cultural capital of europe in 1999 and holy shit did the government + eu throw money at us . 
  i have family in weimar . 
  the city really is beautiful . 
  it 's just that weimar does n't like cars of people that do not live there . 
   also i 'd guess that eu funding was much higher in the 90ies and 2000s than it was in 2010 . 
  it was n't . 
  the budget of the eu was around 71.5 billion euros in 1995 . 
  ecu = european currency unit , later converted 1:1 in euro . 
   simply because there was more to do than there is now . 
  a very large portion is caused by the agricultural grants anyways . 
  the eu is n't really free to spend as it wants to . 
  please provide a translation or at least a short summary .

  i do not say that the funding is minor . 
  i say that the funding is minor compared to the german spending on east germany . 
  the eu funding for germany in 2010 was around 11 bn . 
  in total . 
  if the funding was on that level for every year since the reunification ( which it was n't ) and if all funding went to the new states , the eu would have spent around 286 bn . 
  compared to two trillion $ spending from germany itself , this is comparatively `` minor '' . 
  not even talking about the fact that the eu money is indirectly german money anyways due to us being a net payer . 
   i live in a smallish city that received tens of millions from the eu , so i can tell you that `` minor '' is quite an understatement . 
  judging by your name i would guess weimar ? 
  already saw and approved it . 
  thanks !,

   this is because greece is overhelmed . 
  partly yes . 
  in part it is also because they have severe budget problems and have more important things to spend money on . 
   ( i assume you are reffering to this ruling ) in part , yes . 
  but there are also rulings by german courts . 
   if we improve the situation in greece and hold the turkey deal in place this works . 
  true . 
  but this would require us to do this in the first place . 
  german politicians have been very reluctant to even grant budget leeway for refugees ( in italy and greece ) , let alone our money . 
   if we do n't then it does n't matter what we do because what happened in 2015 will look like a joke . 
  i doubt that - it would mainly fuck greece due to the balkan route being closed . 
   i think you missunderstood me . 
  those people will be taken into custody , be send back to ausria and people who actually filed an asylum case in one of the border countries will be brought to germany . 
  austria wo n't be happy about this . 
  it would also cause problems as getting to greece is much easier than getting to germany .

   your country deliberately ruined greece as a warning to others because its government was unable to pay back private debt , yea , totally . 
  ignore the fact that the decisions on greece were approved by * all * european countries . 
  france had bigger stakes in greece than we did . 
   and now for some godforsaken reason you 're pushing destabilising immigration onto everyone else . 
  in case it escaped you : the resettlement programs are designed to help greece , italy ( and originally hungary ) , not us . 
   oh well , expect more far right victories next year . 
  in which countries ? 
  france ? 
  unlikely . 
  the netherlands ? 
  the pvv might be the strongest party , but they very likely wo n't form the government . 
  this year . 
   make sure to indignantly blame them when they blow up the eu and your comfy trade surplus with it , it might help . 
  in case you missed it : we have a trade surplus with most countries in the world , eu or not . 
  we had a trade surplus before the euro as well . 
  we are taking the approach that does n't require changing the legal fundament . 
  in case you missed it : merkel toured africa trying to put obstacles for the flow . 
  we are supporting camps in the region . 
  we were one of the main forces behind the turkey deal . 
  we did force nobody to change their laws as long as they were compatible with eu law . 
  germany also spent around two trillion euros on the east . 
  the eu funding is minor compared to that .
