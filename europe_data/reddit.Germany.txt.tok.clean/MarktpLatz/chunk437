   look at germany 's net debt during the same period . 
  also declining . 
  actually not . 
  the debt to gdp ratio increased by 16 % during that time . 
  we will reach pre-crisis levels next year however , hopefully we will go below 60 % at the end of the decade . 
  and admittedly , a lot had to do with the fact that the crisis devalued our currency quite a lot .

  talking about germany , almost none . 
  the number of mini-jobs ( not paying social insurance ) is in fact declining , most of them are turned into full jobs . 
  i honestly doubt that . 
  unlike greece , you are competitive and you have a significant export industry . 
   2007-2011 was not good for anybody [ germany begs to differ ] ( https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/germany-s-unemployment-rate-data_chartbuilder.png?w=640 ) . 
  in the beginning of 2007 , we were at 9.0 % , above france . 
  it declined to 7.1 % right before the crash . 
  then , it rose to 7.9 % ( peanuts compared to any other european country ) in july 2009 , at the end of 2011 , we were at 5.5 % . 
  she 's set to win it . 
  recent polls have her party as high as 37 % again . 
  completely irrelevant as nobody is advocating for this to happen . 
  and it also wo n't happen . 
  please provide a source .

  removed . 
  your google translate link leads nowhere . 
  ( the link you entered is faulty ) 2 . 
  please link directly to the german article and put ( in german '' in the title . 
  provide your summary/the link to the translation in the comments . 
   that said probably 70 or 80 % of germanys autobahn have a speed limit as well . 
  its not as if its `` free for all '' everywhere actually its about 1/3 restricted , 1/3 unrestricted , 1/3 temprary restrictions ( like rain , road work and heavy traffic ) . 
  funfact : the autobahns , despite having no limits on a third of the roads , actually have the lowest death toll in germany ( per driven km ) . 
  far lower than the regular highways . 
  see what i wrote elsewhere . 
  the us has roughly ten times the number of gas stations despite only having four times the population or six times the cars . 
  due to their size , they naturally need a higher number of stations . 
  even more so given the limited range of evs . 
  and i have not claimed that . 
  what i wanted to say is that the us generally needs a higher number of charging stations per vehicle due to it being much larger . 
  the vehicle numbers and population size does n't matter that much in this regard . 
  well , they have about six times the number of vehicles . 
  what matters most however is that there is a good grid - and for that , neither the number of vehicles nor the population matters . 
  increased number of vehicles means that the charging stations need more chargers , not that you need more stations . 
  for reference - the us also has 10 times the number of gas stations compared to germany . 
   nope . 
  the catholic religion explicitly says that any given person can not read and interpret the bible any way he wants , that is the job of the pope and the priests . 
  that 's why the pope says that the garden of eden , creationism are all metaphors and the folks should only take the official interpretation of the bible . 
  there are more christian religions than the catholics . 
  and it does n't matter what the catholic church says , what matters ist that the book itself is equally stupid . 
  word-for-word interpretation of the quran is only applied by some of the religious streams that call themselves `` muslim '' . 
   no they wo n't , and in fact , even though terrorists are only a small minority , other behaviors are the norm , such as considering females as inferior beings , beating a wife is accepted procedure by most muslims , public hate of homosexuals etc. 
  as you can see terrorism is only a fraction of the problems . 
  most of this was a widespread belief in our countries 50 years ago . 
  and yes , they would be prosecuted . 
   you are misinterpreting the data because it 's exactly like that . 
  just to name one example : breivik . 
   i can see that there is no use to keep on discussing this topic , you clearly made your mind and it 's fine to me . 
  i made an educated opinion on the topic , yours seems to be dictated by ideals only . 
  you are simply confusing what `` immigration '' means . 
  immigration in no way means that you have to abandon all of your customs and become like the domestic population . 
   i used to firmly believe that too , especially when i was still a student . 
  then i took the time to actually read the quran and guess what : there are hundreds of lines where it explicitly says that `` infidels '' must be killed , their hands chopped and so forth . 
  the bible is full of weird shit . 
  it does n't matter what is written , it matters what people make of it . 
   this is unacceptable , i if were to say the same towards any other group i would be in jail , and yet we keep repeating ourselves that it 's fine , it 's just a religion . 
  yes , it is a religion , and historically speaking in the name of religions millions of people have been killed . 
  thing is : if someone actually utters this in public or even takes action , they will face charges .
