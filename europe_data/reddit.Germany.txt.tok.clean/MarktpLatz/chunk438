   while it is true that not all muslims are terrorists actually , almost none of them are . 
   it is also true that 100 % of terrorists are muslims it is n't . 
  this claim has been debunked so often it 's not even funny anymore . 
   integration does not mean that we should accept their customs in our own countries , it means that they should accept those of the host country . 
  it does n't . 
  what you argue for is assimilation . 
  they are perfectly free to stick with their customs as long as they do not do us any harm . 
  if someone wants to knee on a rug and pray towards mekka , it is n't any different to a guy sitting in a church . 
  they shall abandon customs that are incompatible with our society , they shall learn our language and work with and within our society .

  the other two were removed by other mods . 
  one for being a duplicate and one for lacking a credible source . 
  nothing about `` bias '' there . 
  a racist crime that is goddamn * local * . 
  and thus against the sub rules . 
  i do not desire to impose some kind of world view on anybody through moderation . 
  there are plenty of reports about problems/crimes/critique of the refugees . 
  your claim is without basis . 
   the usa alone has 1800 electric stations the us is 27.5 times the size of germany . 
   they 'll need a lot to make electric cars feasible for europe . 
  you will have to start somewhere . 
  it is . 
  it does n't talk about systematic problems , it talks about anecdotal experience in one small area . 
  it has been reported here on / r/europe before that there is intimidation from muslim refugees in some cases . 
  thus , this qualifies as local crime . 
  meta content belongs into / r/europemeta . 
  if you really want to make this suggestion , post it there .

  please provide a translation . 
  do n't drive up our prices . 
   i just explained you how it affects my freedom . 
  your desire for knowledge is n't part of `` freedom '' . 
  freedom means being allowed to do what you want , it does n't mean being allowed to know everything . 
   not only post crime , but also pre-crime . 
  it is a clear sign of bad intention . 
  obviously we talk about streets here . 
  not ski slopes . 
  uhm . 
  this does n't make my point invalid . 
   nobody walks in a motorcycle helmet nor in a gothic helmet around the street . 
  i have seen people do it . 
   that 's just as alarming as any other face cover used without a reason . 
  biker equips helmet before sitting on his bike and takes it off right after . 
  if you will walk into a bank with helmet on you will instantly get taken down . 
  that 's why i said that i am content with a ban in locations where identification is required . 
   their freedom ends where my begins . 
  your freedom is not hindered in any way by someone else disguising their face . 
   i was raised in a culture where nobody covers their face , and face covering is an act committed by those who do not want to be identified over something usually illegal . 
  generally speaking , this is true when it comes to the direct moment of a robbery . 
  if someone runs around in public with their face covered , it will in fact * raise * awareness of that person . 
   point is , i would react the same to a burka wearing woman on the street as to a balaklawa wearing man - stay away cause they pose a threat . 
  would you react the same way to someone wearing a motorcycle helmet ? 
  i doubt that .
