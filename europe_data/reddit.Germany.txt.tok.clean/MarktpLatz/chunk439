  * by : jim brunsden *  eurozone finance ministers are ready to further flesh out possible debt relief options for greece once further progress in made in the latest review of its bailout programme , the president of eurogroup has said . 
   speaking in brussels on tuesday , jeroen dijsselbloem said he hoped a `` staff level agreement '' on the review would be completed by finance ministers ' next meeting on december 5 . 
   `` this would allow the eurogroup to have a further discussion on the short , medium , and long term debt measures needed , '' he said . 
   should the agreement on the review be reached in time , december 's meeting will see ministers engage in intense negotiations between the euro area and international monetary fund on whether the imf will join the $ 86bn bailout of greece -- a decision with major implications when it comes to parliamentary support for the greek programme in germany and some other euro area nations . 
   a key point to be resolved in those talks will be how long greece will be expected to maintain the 3.5 per cent primary budget surplus target that the country is scheduled to hit in 2018 . 
   `` it will be one of the key debates , '' said the dutch finance minister , adding : * the imf has argued that you can not ask greek to maintain that for a very long time , and others have said that , ` well , it 's going to be necessary given the fact that greece has to comply with the stability and growth pact ' . 
  so , in between those two we will need to find a realistic path forward , and i 'm saying realistic because i think the imf has a point that running a primary surplus of 3.5 for a very long time is a huge thing to ask . 
  *  a primary surplus measures the budget excluding debt repayments . 
  the eurogroup president added that he hoped the imf would become `` fully involved again '' in the programme . 
   mr dijsselbloem also took a veiled swipe at a recommendation from the european commission that the euro area should aim for a fiscal stimulus equivalent to 0.5 per cent of gdp next year , pointing out that it runs counter to budget plans that governments have already agreed on with the eu . 
   the commission made the recommendation earlier this month , as a way of putting pressure on countries in a strong budgetary position , such as germany and the netherlands , to do more to boost demand and stimulate growth . 
   `` some would argue that given the position where we are in the economic cycle , where the output gap is closing , that in some countries it would not be wise to stimulate further with fiscal policy , '' he said . 
   commission officials `` need to realise '' that governments are put in a complicated situation if the institution 's guidance on the broader fiscal stance clashes with eu budget rules intended to make sure nations do not overspend , he said .

  elvishcopter linked the source in the comments . 
  you will find germany and a few other countries there . 
  well - they did . 
   i think if germany calls the shots by itself then people in other countries are less likely to realise that their own government is not part of the decision making process , because germany does at least try to do this kind of thing quite discreetly , because it is a bit embarrassed . 
  we 're bad at keeping this secret however . 
  everyone in europe is complaining about the `` german diktat '' already . 
  there are several countries that would be happier with a powerful france than with a powerful germany . 
  some politicians floated the idea of simply granting eu citizenship to all brits abroad/to all who want it free of charge . 
  wo n't go anywhere though . 
  some ( i think italy ) advocate for offering people continental citizenship . 
  some say it will depend on the deal for the people living on the respective side . 
  what is the alternative ? 
  you either piss of half of europe if germany calls the shots or you have the possibility that everyone is somewhat consent ( apart from ee maybe ) if there is the tandem . 
  that 's what i figured . 
  kind of sad . 
  how does that statement even make sense ? 
  alright then .

  do n't know about that , i am sorry . 
  politicians of various countries are throwing around proposals at the moment . 
  could be either . 
  but as i said , i do not think that such a policy is likely to be implemented . 
   is there a realistic chance of british people being allowed to remain eu citizens after the uk leaves the eu , or is this a fringe proposal ? 
  unlikely . 
  i think we could see some countries making it easier for uk citizens to obtain their citizenship though . 
   is it likely that this will come with a fee ? 
  if so , how much might that fee be , and would it need to be paid annually ? 
  would it need to be paid even after settling in a country that 's still in the eu ? 
  if it comes , there will very certainly be some kind of fee attached to it . 
   is it likely that eu citizens would be able to claim benefits in their new resident country , and be a full eu citizens in every other way ? 
  i think we can agree that , out of the realistic options for the next decade , a tandem is the best option .
