  this however is unrealistic for the forseeable future . 
  especially with either fillon or le pen becoming the next president of france .

   oh wow ... an article you wrote yourself ... such an authoritative source ... 
  completely sourced . 
   https://www.destatis.de/en/pressservices/press/pr/2016/07/pe16_246_12421.html total migration ! = refugees . 
   http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/refugee-policy-of-chancellor-merkel-divides-europe-a-1053603.html the article talks about `` underestimating the inviting power of her words '' - she never issued an invitation . 
  the fact that her words were interpreted as an invite does n't make her words an invitation . 
  but feel free to provide a first hand source with merkel giving an invitation . 
   the list of sources ( that you did n't write yourself ) is almost endless ... but i see you are intent on not only destroying europe but your own country too . 
  good one . 
  the whole thing i wrote is sourced to the last bit . 
   your figures are bullshit too . 
  i said two years . 
  let 's see what the real numbers for two years were :  http://www.dw.com/en/two-million-germany-records-largest-influx-of-immigrants-in-2015/a-19131436 again , this is total migration and not refugees . 
  a totally different issue . 
  the article was also written before the number of refugees was revised to 890,000 for 2015 . 
   1.1 million for 2015 and 2 million in two years ( 2015-2016 ) you 're pulling numbers out of your arse . 
  again , the number for 2015 was revised to 890,000 refugees . 
  where to you get the numbers for 2016 from ? 
  the year is not yet finished . 
   why do you think the borders went up ? 
  do you think it was because of `` normal '' immigration levels ? 
  it was you and sweden inviting them , even tempting them to come . 
  again , there was no invitation , no matter how often you are going to repeat it . 
  point me at evidence for an invitation other than news sites claiming that `` there was an invite '' . 
  ah forget it . 
   sylvia pantel literally who ?

   several papers suggest there were close to 1.5 ... anti-anti-immigration sites say `` hundreds of thousands '' i do n't think you can put any official number on it . . oh , i can . 
  the official number is 890,000 for 2015 . 
   the border countries got screwed over because your great leader fucking invited millions of them to enter europe . 
  [ we invited nobody . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/marktplatz/gilded/ )  you think they want millions arriving by boats trying to get in so they can run to germany ?? 
  nobody wants that . 
  but given that these people were arriving , letting them pass is certainly easier than registering them . 
   schengen was shut down because of you . 
  even austria your greatest friends says so . 
  if austria would be a goddamn mess if the border was n't opened . 
   70 % of germans might have been in favour then ... 
  i wonder how many now ... after cologne , after the new year rapes/molestations ... 
  the number of rapes on nye was three iirc . 
  i also do not get why you are metioning cologne and nye like they are two different things . 
  in februar , after nye and after we had taken in what was then suspected to be 1.1 million people , just 22 % were in favor of taking in no more refugees . 
  over 70 % were in favor of taking in 200,000 people annually or even more . 
  right now , 60 % of people are positive that germany will be able to cope with the refugee influx . 
  yeah no shit . 
  that 's why it is n't prosecuted . 
  that 's why claiming that `` holding that opinion '' is illegal is stupid . 
  just submit the link ? 
  we do not need to go back to the very old days though . 
  france used the eu as a tool to greatly punch over their weight - germany was playing a role smaller than what would be due for a country of our size and power . 
  i like a good balance . 
  maybe we can even get italy into the mix . 
   you accepted millions of migrants there were n't `` millions '' , sorry to disappoint you . 
  you do not even get to two millions if you combine all years since 2008 . 
   then guess what not all of them wanted to eat bratwurst and speak german so they left . 
  we are talking about a rather small number of people here . 
   then hungary and other border countries got totally screwed over by your country 's decision . 
  the border countries got screwed over because they failed to do their fucking job - protecting the eu external borders . 
  because they failed to register the refugees . 
  because they disobeyed rules . 
  because they refused to take back refugees . 
  because they were not capable or willing to offer humane conditions to the refugees . 
   your country caused the shutdown of schengen . 
  the `` shutdown '' of schengen was caused by countries allowing these people to pass through illegally . 
   really . 
  so all the stories about germans revolting/parading and the rapes and fires were the imagination of the right-wing press were they ? 
  uhm . 
  there are no germans `` revolting '' . 
  of course there will be groups protesting . 
  but you do not get to `` nobody '' if you just focus on some people demonstrating . 
  if you just focus on rightwingers . 
  remember - 70 % of germans were in favour of opening the borders when it happened . 
  and even now , most people are not afraid of the refugees themselves , they are afraid that we will not be able to cope with the influx . 
  a fear that is getting less and less justified due to declining numbers . 
   `` he often says that he wants that france again become the preeminent european power and to take back control of its destiny , '' pertusot said . 
  `` that means to counterbalance germany 's power and it will not be taken as a good sign in berlin . '', 
  two things to consider : if france gets into that position again , it means that they did their homework and the economy will be running again . 
  this would be good for germany as well - it would bring stabiliy to the euro zone and we should not forget that france is our export destination # 2 . 
  secondly - the eu as a whole works better if it is the tandem ( fra-ger ) calling the shots and not just germany . 
  i also believe that it produces better results for everybody . 
  not if it is enforced by courts . 
   the definition of it is very unclear . 
  the application of this term by our courts is very consistent however . 
   ummmm ( such a childish parasite word ) it means you do n't want them who wants refugees ?
