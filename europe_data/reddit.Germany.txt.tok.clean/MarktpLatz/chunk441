  even germany is n't eager to take as much refugees as possible . 
  but this does n't hinder us from accepting them for humanitarian reasons . 
   your country welcomed them with open arms that 's our decision . 
   and imposed immigration rules on the rest of the eu member states without a care in the world . 
  and how exactly did we do that ? 
   and nobody in your country likes it apart from the lefty liberals who care more about someone they never met than their own kind . 
  now thats inaccurate . 
  not supported by evidence . 
   germany and sweden are paying money for them to go back home . 
  uhm . 
  so what ? 
  we have done that with the balkan refugees and we are doing it now ( albeit on a small scale ) . 
  there is literally nothing wrong with it . 
  in fact , it is actually cheaper than the alternatives . 
  again - the opinion itself is not illegal . 
  spreading it is . 
  read again what i wrote . 
  having an opinion and expressing it are two pairs of shoes . 
  show me a law that allows the government to prosecute thought crimes . 
  this is no x-post .

  unfortunately , this is n't possible . 
  we can only sticky mod comments . 
  well - having that opinion is n't illegal . 
  spreading it in certain countires is and spreading on certain subreddits ( including this one ) will get you banned . 
  well , now that is your opinion . 
  it works both ways . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.epochtimes.de/politik/deutschland/bundesumweltministerium-zahlte-millionen-an-clinton-foundation-a1986616.html ), 
  the thing is : successful funding of this kind does n't make it into the news . 
  if the money would not arrive there , it * would * make news . 
  given that there is an article about this funding to the clinton foundation , i would be surprised if they did not check whether the money actually arrived there . 
  any source that it did n't ?

  thanks !, 
  and i just remembered reading about this a few years back . 
  the reason why the signs are dutch on both sides is pretty simply - they are cheaper than the german ones . 
  the bus stations on the dutch side on the other hand are german because one bus line is operated by a german company . 
  can anybody tell me what qualifies as `` prematurely '' ? 
  it 's a rather abstract claim . 
  please provide a translation or a short summary . 
  why not ? 
  people are free to have any opinion they want . 
  do you know that or are you just judging based on the signs visible in this picture ? 
  the traffic signs of [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/road_signs_in_germany ) and [ the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/road_signs_in_the_netherlands ) are almost identical anyways . 
  thanks !,

  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/denkmal_neustra%c3%9fe.jpg ) is a sculpture at the end of the street that is the border between the netherlands and germany . 
  the text is a quote from [ friedrich schillers poem `` ode to joy '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ode_to_joy ) which would later be the basis for [ beethovens 9th symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icikr8numks ) - the anthem of europe ( yes , i know that we only use the instrumental version as a hymn ) . 
  it translates to `` all people become brothers '' . 
  -- -- -- sidenote : during football games between germany and the netherlands , there is an increased number of policemen watching . 
  not because there is violence between the people living on either side , but because in the past there were incidents where people from all over germany and the netherlands `` met up '' in the street - ending up in a rather large brawl . 
  [ bonus picture ] ( http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/polopoly_fs/1.455027.1353320573!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/zva_quer_540/image.jpg ) - unfortunately in shitty quality . 
  please post the full article in the comments . 
  finished with you rconspiracy theory ? 
  you have no reliable evidence of this happening . 
  especially not considering the german involvement , which we are talking about here .
