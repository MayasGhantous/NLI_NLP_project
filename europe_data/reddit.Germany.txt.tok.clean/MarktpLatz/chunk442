  same . 
  and generally speaking , the newspapers still obey that rule , even online . 
  it 's just that their social media divisions are running amok .

  well , the `` welt '' itself is going for the hard clickbait on facebook , making it look like this was [ problematic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rwndgvx.jpg ) . 
  ( but then , they are always doing this on facebook ) . 
  i wo n't argue with that . 
  yeah of course . 
  but that 's why i translated the relevant part that pretty much nullifies any claims of `` germany funding clintons campaign '' . 
   can we keep the right-wing outrage/conspiracy media off this sub , please ? 
  go to uncensorednews or any of those other shitholes to post this , plz . 
  the thing is - the article is perfectly legitimate . 
  it is from a major german news outlet that really is n't `` rightwing/conspiracy media '' . 
  the problem arises out of the fact that it is in german and people only got the translated headline .

  it really is n't . 
  they have worked with the clinton foundation before . 
  relevant part : * the ministry for environmental issues told the `` welt '' that they do not make donations . 
  the money in question was financing in the [ international climate intiative ( iki ) ] ( https://www.international-climate-initiative.com/en/?iki_lang=en&amp;chash=3fa9cbdf06d5d23e1efb5e0e740f9260 ) . 
  * * the tax money in question is meant for renaturation of forests and agriculture in east africa . 
  the project is carried out by the clinton foundation in kenya and ethiopia with german co-financing .

  link the source please, 
  adopting a point based system is n't a proposal unique to the afd though . 
  it has been suggested people of all political couleurs before . 
  neither is limiting the influx of refugees or reforming/implementing a new immigration law . 
  realpolitik is not ` dancing like a puppet ' . 
  yeah , kinda . 
  no significant changes in crime rates but crime everywhere . 
  just a small correction : we initially assumed that we took in 1.1 million , but the counting was inaccurate as it was based on a system prone to inaccuracies . 
  the actual number was 890,000 .

  off topic . 
  immune from punishment ! = legal . 
  since this is international law , what you think you are allowed to do means jackshit . 
  i know that the us said it might do that , but this does n't make it any less illegal . 
  actually they could . 
  it is a matter of political will .

  low effort/off topic .

  removed , duplicate . 
  you do realize that the reason why russia has little foreign debt is the fact that you went bankrupt two decades ago and that you have struggled to get any meaningful loans from western banks since then ? 
  and no , russia is not capable of `` easily coming on top '' . 
  if you believe that , you have a distorted view of reality . 
  old news . 
  has been posted before . 
  removed . 
  i disagree with that . 
  consider this response a warning . 
  they will . 
  there is no reason not to . 
  well , you are out of luck . 
  same for people named samuel adams for example .

  we do not allow rt as a source . 
  i think deaths per 100,000 people is a stupid metric . 
  it does n't take into account that the popularity of driving differs and that the average distance covered varies . 
  road deaths per billion vehicle miles is much better if you want a fair comparison .
