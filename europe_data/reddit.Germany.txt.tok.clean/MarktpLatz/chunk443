  use / r/askeurope for questions . 
  hj - hitlerjugend ( hitler youth ) sa - sturmabteilung ( paramilitary of the nsdap ) kz - konzentrationslager ( concentration camp ) it 's not banned by law by the way - but since it 's essentially the government issuing the number plates , they can simply not issue these combinations . 
  -- -- -- i doubt that anybody in germany apart from that woman really cares . 
  h982 fkl ( kind of funny since i 'm watching episode 2 of the grand tour right now ) would never happen here . 
  well , the context really only comes up because `` ss '' is banned for license plates . 
  we have very few banned combinations - all are related to the third reich : hj , ss , sa & kz . 
  -- -- -- i do agree with you though - unless you really want to read something into it , you wo n't notice . 
  no worries . 
  have a nice evening !,

   but they do argue for all countries being subject to the same eu straitjacket which clearly impacts different countries in totally different ways with devastating consequences . 
  in the long run this approach is unsustainable . 
  the eu needs to become far more flexible and accommodating to the various differences of its members and their different preferences . 
  this is the only way the eu can survive in the long-run . 
  it does not seem to recognise this . 
  this is completely unrelated to the topic we are talking about - turkey . 
   uk is just being pragmatic and taking this approach first , recognising that this is what the people of the uk want . 
  sooner or later the rest of europe is going to be doing this too . 
  i do not think that it is `` pragmatic '' , i would call it populist or even nationalistic . 
  i doubt that this rhetoric will be adopted in most of europe . 
  you really have no clue what you are talking about . 
  if everyone is special , nobody is . 
  nobody argues that all countries are the same , but the u.k. is the one country ( in europe ) insisting on being super special . 
  it does n't matter what the u.k. believes , this does n't change reality . 
  see edit by the way . 
   uk is now leaving the eu so does not need to worry about being the uk being in an eu with turkey sorry , but this just kills any further argument . 
  there is no reason to believe that the u.k. is some special snowflake that would be hurt by turkey joining ( in whatever way ) while the other eu members are not affected by it . 
  and rational - i do not think so . 
  it 's hypocritical at best . 
  the u.k. no longer has the power to have a major impact on this - and rightfully so . 
  i would argue that it is . 
  and i have never claimed that the other former gdr states are like the west . 
  there is still a big difference between 20 % and 25 % . 
  it actually is . 
  and no , they are not ` equally strong ' everywhere in the east . 
  this does nothing to prove your point . 
  whatsoever . 
  paywalled .

  you have no clue how our laws work then . 
  honestly i do not give a fuck . 
  but this is simply low effort content that has no place here . 
  it does n't contribute anything . 
  you did n't even get the spelling right .

  i doubt that this will happen . 
  the government parties will not copy the stance of the afd . 
  nope , in pretty much * any * recent poll that is not insa . 
  things that are unsafe wo n't be allowed under ttip either . 
   i highly doubt immigrants/refugees from syria and iraq want to go home or even can . 
  why should a shia syria or iraq want to take back millions of sunni muslims ? 
  or why should a yazidi want to return ? 
  nobody expects * everybody * to return . 
  this is unrealistic . 
  but we will see , i am pretty confident . 
   besides that the whole legitimate refugees definition is blurry at best . 
  not really , no . 
   eritrea is a good example of a descent african country from where they get asylum without reason . 
  nope . 
  the afd is * declining * however . 
   a new poll shows almost two-thirds of germans think islam does not `` belong '' in their country . 
  uhm . 
  so what ? 
  that 's a pretty broad question . 
   europe , for example germany , can not become an arab country . 
  and it wo n't . 
  this is completely out of discussion . 
  the us also has a lot of great products .
