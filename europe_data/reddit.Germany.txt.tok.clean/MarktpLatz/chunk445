  this is just one of the federal states though . 
  and the most right-wing state . 
  in 2004 , the goddamn npd ( and those guys are legitimate nazis ) reached 9.2 % over there . 
  they have been marginalized by the afd now . 
  on a federal level , the tendency for the afd is n't positive ( for them ) - some polls have them at 10 % again . 
  fortunately , there wo n't be another election in saxony for two more years .

  the point of taking refugees is never getting a benefit . 
  the reasons are purely humanitarian . 
  let me get a few things straight : 1 . 
  most germans do not have a problem with taking 200,000 refugees a year ( only 22 % do n't want no refugees at all ) . 
  there are legal reasons why we can not enforce dublin and send people back to greece 3 . 
  there are legal reasons why we can not send people to turkey 4 . 
  we can not send people back to syria no matter what 3 . 
  the vast majority of syrians are legitimate war refugees 4 . 
  how is that in any way related to the share of syrians going down in october ? 
  statistics of this kind would be no help in `` fixing '' problems . 
  plus it is a questionable policy anyways . 
  what / u/mistermysterios wrote hits it pretty well . 
   why is germany accepting so many immigrants from other countries ? 
  our choice , is n't it ? 
  there are . 
  but `` immigrant background '' is a very broad term . 
  i thought the same when i first read it . 
   but is n't syrians only the third biggest immigrant group since the crisis started ? 
  i thought most immigrants actually came from pakistan and afghanistan . 
  holy shit you could not be more wrong . 
  syrians are * by far * the most relevant group . 
  in 2015 , 35.9 % of applications were from syrians . 
  afghanistan was 7.1 % , pakistan 1.9 % . 
   yes , where do n't they blur faces ? 
  he ist talking about `` bleaching the faces '' - this is not happening . 
  we are blurring them but we are not making dark-skinned people look white . 
  why would we do that ? 
  nope . 
  depends on the paper you are talking about . 
  local newspapers report about lesser crimes as well . 
   most of the refugees from the war in balkan stayed behind after the war was over . 
   the last thing about the pixelated face bleaching is just something i heard from a german friend of a friend that i played with online , that is why i am asking . 
  he 's probably a right-wing nut . 
  i overread the `` bleached '' for some reason . 
  corrected that now . 
  spam .

   how this could be a duplication ???????? 
  [ here is the answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5e3jln/support_for_eu_rises_since_brexit_vote_survey/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  stop posting meta content of this kind or you will see a ban . 
  if you have any questions considering the moderating or moderation policy , use / r/europemeta . 
  because it is prone to abuse . 
  you could edit a highly upvoted thread to send a completely different message . 
  this ca n't happen when you directly link the article . 
   where i live , politicians ( both left and right ) use germany as an example of how dangerous mass-immigration is . 
  these people do not have a clue what is going on here then . 
   also , is it true that the media bleaches the blurred faces of criminals no . 
   that there is no statistics on people sorted by race ? 
  not that i am aware of . 
  there are statistics based on nationality however . 
  why what ?

  that 's nonsense . 
  read some free trade 101 . 
  trade is , unless completely unbalanced , mutually beneficial . 
  since the echr is interpreted by judges , not really . 
  this wo n't change anything about the price ? 
  i do n't expect that either  take your time , have fun reading !, 
  uhm . 
  so what ? 
  it 's kind of astonishing to see how little republicans care about the `` fiscal conservatism '' they promote in the elections . 
  it seriously is a goddamn joke to see people criticize the democrats for going into debt while praising reagan . 
  without wanting to take anything away from you - but comparing the loss in wealth for the average greek with the loss in wealth for the average german in 1923 is a bit ridiculous . 
  greece was - until recently - used to high amounts of inflation . 
  well , look at the rates of 1923 . 
  people were actually payed every day because the money would be worthless a few days later . 
  all the people had left were the physical goods they possessed and their houses ( if they had one ) . 
  if he really gets his tax cuts through congress - possible . 
  i am not contesting that . 
  i simply said that some politicians in your country make it sound like you are on the verge of bankruptcy . 
  well , given that he does n't even have the book yet , this would n't make much sense .
