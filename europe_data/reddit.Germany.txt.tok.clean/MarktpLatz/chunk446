  nobody is checking back on week old threads . 
  this however was n't his core proposal . 
  it is n't what his campaign was based on . 
  does n't make it any less moronic of course . 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  we did not force anybody to enter the eurozone . 
  we are also not `` stealing '' anthing - your government recieves compensation and a share of the profits , the airports ( some of which are ranked in the top ten of europes worst airports ) will recieve some desperately needed investments . 
  i would contest that . 
  trump might be a moron , but believing that you could use qe ( she calls it a `` magic trick '' ) to erase college debt is taking stupidity to the next level . 
  and this is her core proposal . 
  she also repeatedly has proven that she does not know what she is talking about and that she is prone to populism . 
  i am sorry , but we do not torelate the advertizing of other subreddits without consultation of the mods in advance here . 
  i am personally appreciating your idea , but i obviously ca n't decide this on my own . 
  would you be so kind to write a mod mail about your proposal so we can consult the other mods about this ? 
  does n't prevent your politicians from inflating it verbally however . 
  could you please message me whether the book really makes wrong claims of this kind or whether / u/problemy is just misreporting its contents ? 
  that 's up to the judges to decide . 
  as one of the witnesses put it : `` i saw them and they seemed like a bachelor party to me '' . 
   the green party , jill stein was advocating for a ranked voting sytem . 
  too bad that she is utterly incompetent . 
  the ruling is based on that law . 
  what these people were wearing was n't considered a uniform however . 
  our rightwing `` reichsb\u00fcrger '' tried to establish an own police force - [ their uniforms looked like this ] ( https://www.psiram.com/ge/images/4/40/dphw_bild.jpg ) - there is no discussion that this is a uniform . 
  [ this ] ( http://pi-news.net/wp/uploads/2015/12/image34-440x247.jpg ) is n't and it really does n't fool anybody . 
  the only complaint about the content that i have is that it is a goddamn trailer . 
  the fact that it is five months old only adds to that . 
  good for you . 
   printing money while at the same time sending away the gold it was pegged to . 
  not really . 
  the gold standard was abandoned in 1914 when the government ruled that the central bank was no longer required to exchange paper money for gold . 
   they were ordered to pay in deutschemark . 
  so they printed the money and gave to french . 
  of course that made inflation go crazy , first of all , the currency was n't called deutschmark - that is the name of the currency between 1949 and 2001 . 
  additionally , what you are claiming is wrong . 
  the reparations were in goldmark ( which was not affected by the inflation ) and in goods . 
  the treaty of versailles demanded 20 billion goldmark ( around 7,000 tons of gold ) . 
  the allied countries later demanded 269 billion goldmark and 12 % of our exports . 
  this was later reduced to 132 billion goldmark ( 47,000 tons of gold/700 bn . 
  $ current day value ) and 26 % of our exports . 
  payments were meant to be made over 66 years . 
  when germany failed to comply , french and belgian troops occupied the ruhr area . 
  this was met by a general strike in that area - financed by the printing press . 
  this is what lead to the hyperinflation of 1923 . 
   in the end inflation was easily dealt with that 's a bit of an overstatement . 
  they issued a new currency , killing off the inflation , but the consequences were felt by the population . 
  many people lost their whole wealth . 
  this is 5 months old .

  i am not aware of any direct us support for the pkk . 
   kurds are communists and extreme left by the way . 
  generalizing statements of this kind are wrong and untrue . 
  you can hardly make walking in shirts with something written on it illegal . 
  you would ban most bachelor parties by doing so . 
  spoken like a true frenchman . 
  it is kind of sad to see the us that low .

  well , i am not a lawyer , but at least a law student . 
  the problem is that you would to create a very broad law to criminalize what these guys did . 
  what do you want to make the crime here ? 
  talking to people ? 
  running around in shirts with something written on them ? 
  walking around in groups ?

  i disagree . 
  as i have said elsewhere :  there is no way to put something of this kind into a law . 
  a law that would us allow to punish these people for what they did would be a universal tool to prosecute anyone - a law that dictators would like . 
  well , you can not handle it different if you have no indication that someone has been intimidated . 
  you can not prosecute people without any indication that they have broken a law . 
  reporting about that court case ? 
  the court questioned people who have seen the `` police '' group . 
  i do n't think the map in particular has been posted , but we had the [ data ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4se4u1/antimuslim_views_rise_across_europe_pew_research/ ) posted here a while back . 
  we also tend to get maps of this kind all the time , they just do n't appear due to being duplicates .

  this still does n't make your statement true .
