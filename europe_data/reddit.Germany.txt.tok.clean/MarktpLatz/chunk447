  please provide a translation or at least a summary so i can approve this post . 
  we are already doing that . 
  you can not prohibit people to speak their mind though . 
  it is not illegal to encourage other people not to dring alcohol or to take drugs . 
  it is not illegal to encourage other people to convert to islam . 
  as long as you do not threaten or force them . 
   the greek crisis was actually predicted by the market , hence the spiking interest rates you should look that up . 
  the spike essentially happened after greece published their revised budget deficit in 2009 , after the papandreou government came into power . 
  if you want to call this a `` prediction '' - it was n't even a year until shit hit the fan . 
  who expected the euro crisis ? 
  some economists warned of the financial crisis or the euro crisis - but we have economists warning of an upcoming crisis at any given point . 
  no government in the world expected the greek crisis . 
  not even greece . 
  the euro crisis is deeply connected with the greek crisis . 
  this has nothing to do with being a refugee or `` being from hamburg '' ? 
  there is no way to put something of this kind into a law . 
  a law that would us allow to punish these people for what they did would be a universal tool to prosecute anyone - a law that dictators would like . 
   how about may blasting eu leadership on : eurocrisis preparedness , greek crisis preparedness , refugee crisis preparedness ? 
  the first two are topics that do not even touch the uk . 
  may talking about these topics wo n't get her anywhere . 
  secondly , brexit is completely unlike the other three . 
  nobody could realisticly expect the euro crisis , the greek crisis or the refugee crisis . 
  the possibility of a brexit on the other side was known for years . 
  or even decades considering the anti-eu sentiments in the eu . 
  ever heared of `` freedom of religion '' ? 
  we have millions of peaceful muslims in this country . 
  atta was neither from hamburg nor a refugee . 
  everything you just said is completely unrelated to `` kicking people out '' or the general tone of your previous comment , implying that they are from somewhere else . 
  uhm ? 
  this does not change anything about the fact that parents claim about `` new europeans '' and `` accepting '' could not be more wrong . 
  there is a difference between disagreeing with a law and believing that people should be prosecuted without violating any law . 
  nobody felt intimidated by it however . 
  that 's up to the courts to decide . 
  nobody felt harassed here . 
  as it has been quoted elsewhere , one of the witnesses thought it was some kind of bachelor party - people simply did not give a fuck . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  sven lau is a german that was born cathoic . 
  most of them are germans , not refugees . 
  what you said is simply inaccurate and ignorant . 
  nothing to add . 
  the rule of law being secured is actually a requirement for freedom if you have government institutions and law . 
  the other option is having no law at all , but we fortunately do not live in these times . 
  there is no harassing of women involved here 2 . 
  you hate freedom because you advocate for punishment of actions that are not illegal by law . 
  you hate freedom because you contest the rule of law . 
  yeah lets go back to the awesome times where people could just be prosecuted without breaking any law . 
  seriously ? 
  joke 's on you - sven lau is german and a born catholic . 
   they were trying to verbally and visually establish a territory within a state under a totalitarian system with rival laws and law enforcement and did so wearing distinctive attire . 
  they did not not it though . 
  there are no reports by people feeling intimidated if i am not mistaken . 
   i 'm saying words got an old lady imprisoned because words and ideas do matter . 
  again , that is completely different . 
  as soon as they threaten someone verbally , they will be in the area where they would have to face charges . 
  they did n't though . 
   ya never mind , their preacher , sven lau send people to fight for islamic state - but no law was broken . 
  why are people like you so eager to abandon the rule of law and just punish people even though they did not break any laws ? 
  sven lau is currently imprisoned and awaiting trial for exactly the things you mentioned . 
  due process is followed , there is literally nothing to worry about in this regard . 
   registration tax is so low in germany . 
  0 . o you could also say that it is high elsewhere , 
  that 's ... something totally different though ? 
  these people are n't walking around telling people that the holocaust did n't happen or threatening people . 
   trying to enforce their ideas upon others , now in my opinion , they should be in jail . 
  as soon as they actually try to impose their beliefs on others by whatever means that go beyond talking , they will have to face charges .

   i highly doubt that read what i wrote [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5e6vmr/germany_investigating_tesla_according_to_der/daawqjm/ )  czech national bank which is suing the vw confirms my feeling i am pretty certain that they are suing vw for something that is related to shares and the market in general , not about their cars .

  well , somewhat . 
  they had a crash and the battery exploded , killing the two people in the car . 
  they would not have died if not for the battery . 
  it 's not like the car just exploded however . 
  the netherlands and norway are special cases if we are honest . 
  no , it is offering easy solutions for complex problems .
