   `` overall , table 7 appears to show that scaap is significantly under-estimating the number of incarcerated illegal aliens . 
  if this is correct , one possible reason is the problem of truthful self-reporting '' immediately after that statement , it says :  however , our conclusion that scaap underreports illegal aliens is tenuous . 
  there are only five jurisdictions in the table out of the hundreds that participate in the scaap program . 
  the same with the other point where they mentioned self-reporting as an issue :  however , the problem of false claims to u.s. citizenship is less likely in 287 ( g ) programs than in other corrections data because the 287 ( g ) booking officers are trained in how to interview foreign-born individuals and can more easily verify the information given because they have direct access to immigration databases . 
  -- -- -- as i said , there are more problems than the self-reporting . 
  which makes your claim that `` the statistics are skewed * because * of self-reporting '' invalid in my opinion . 
  you present it in a way that indicates that it is the one reason causing problems - it simply is n't . 
  i do not claim that the data published is flawless by the way . 
  the report does not support what you claim though . 
  the report says that the fact that * some * ( ! ), 
  of the methods involve self-reporting might cause problems but they did not establish any kind of systematic problem in this regard . 
  they even elaborated how some of the metrics involving self-reporting have safeguards against people reporting the wrong thigs . 
  the reports outlines various other issues in estimating the foreign-born prison population , the self-reporting used in some of the estimates plays a minor role . 
  tesla does n't even have the capacity to satisfy its home market . 
  they currently pose no significant threat to any carmaker in germany . 
  long-term maybe , but this will be at least five years in the future , if not more . 
  tesla has sold around 1500 cars in germany last year 2 . 
  german carmakers and suppliers hold around 58 % of the worlds patents on autonomous driving . 
  tesla has run into troubles with its auto pilot feature in multiple countries , including the us - promting them to issue statements that the features are not an `` auto pilot '' but rather `` driving assistants '' .

  source ? 
   it 's funny that we came to this , since it seems like we essentialy want the same thing - not to boost populists in our countries , unfortunately in this particular case , not helping populists in germany means helping populists in the czech republic ( or just in ee in general ) and vice versa . 
  yeah , true . 
   only i was n't really aware that this `` not showing solidarity '' narrative in regards of ee is prevalent among german populists ( i suppose you mean mainly afd ) , i always assumed that these people would more likely side with the ee on the migration issue and it would rather be the political mainstream which would be very critical of ee . 
  it is possible to have both if you are a populist party . 
  you can also complain about the refugees having a bad opinion about homosexuals while being against homosexuality yourself . 
  there are politicians with populist tendencies in all parties by the way . 
   but i thought you said you were gon na take 200k people . 
  i said that 's the amount of people we are willing to take . 
  not the amount that we * will * take . 
  we , as any other nation on earth , wo n't make efforts to take in as much refugees as our society tolerates . 
  of course we will be happy if we take fewer people than 200,000 . 
  what we certainly will take are the 40k from italy and greece . 
  it also is n't like there are no new arrivals in germany . 
  we still have over 10,000 monthly arrivals and we are bracing ourselves for a significant increase in applications from turkey . 
   the same thing does for ukraine , ukrainians are being drafted too , only in much smaller numbers . 
  that 's a different scenario . 
  the government of ukraine is not some murdering regime like the syrian one . 
  the conflict in ukraine has a different nature . 
  and last but not least , the number of casualties in ukraine is much lower than in syria . 
   well i did n't exactly had the success of the resettlement programmes in mind anyway . 
  that was the whole point however . 
   we 're too small of a country to make any sort of difference . 
  this logic is wrong in my opinion . 
  while we have some large countries in europe ( germany , uk , spain , italy , france , poland ) , most of them are of medium or small size . 
  czechia is in fact # 11 out of 28 when it comes to the number of inhabitants . 
  each of these `` smaller '' countries is too small to make any sort of difference , but combined they very much make a significant difference . 
  it also is not only about `` making a difference '' as about `` showing solidarity '' . 
  it has always been clear that it would be us ( germany ) taking the lions share . 
  it would just help a great bit if countries like yours do not help our populists by giving them reasons to complain about a `` lack of solidarity '' in europe . 
   what i meant was that we could fullfill our humanitarian responsibility in a way that is acceptable to our population . 
  btw . 
  there are also internally displaced persons in ukraine . 
  those could fit the refugee definition . 
  i do n't see why these people could not qualify for the resettlement as well . 
  ukraine should be capable of taking care of these people inside its own borders . 
  much more so than any of the origins of refugees to europe . 
   i would say the terrorists actually want us to take as many refugees as possible . 
  more refugees = more opportunities to hide a jihadist among them and more tensions between the refugees and the locals which is only good for the terrorists . 
  it has been widely reported that the islamist terror organizations are very wealthy and thus do not need to rely on the refugee streams to get terrorists into europe . 
   however what happened in hungary shows it takes one skillful power-hungry politician to undermine the checks and balances . 
  the situation in poland is also concerning . 
  well , many countries have this problem at the moment . 
   and our finance minister , leader of the populist ano party is set to win the next election . 
  he 's the second richest czech , he owns several news media and he occasionally says stuff like that parliamentary democracy is slow and ineffective and that he would like to switch to the majority-system and so on . 
  when ( or if ) he is the next pm , i really have no idea what 's he gon na do . 
  he might do nothing or he might try to grab more power for himself . 
  he 's now in the government for 3 years and we still do n't fucking know what he 's gon na do , neither him nor his party have any consistent ideological background . 
  so yes , this is all concerning to me . 
  maybe i 'm being a bit too alarmist and pessimistic , but it 's just that i realize that none of what we currently have is automatic . 
  better be safe than sorry . 
  interesting . 
  i really was n't aware that you would have an election in 2017 as well . 
  i guess that few people will notice however - it will be overshadowed by the german election that will happen at the same time . 
   anyway i also wanted to thank you for the discussion . 
  you bring the german asylum/migration policy in a broader perspective which i admit i probably often fail to see . 
  much appreciated !, 
   i still think that the german policy acts in a way as a pull factor but i admit that it is much more difficult to do anything about this than it would seem at the first sight . 
  well , many people in our own country fail to see the difficulties connected with this topic , so i can hardly blame you . 
  unfortunately , this is also what allows for populists like the afd to gain votes in the first place .
