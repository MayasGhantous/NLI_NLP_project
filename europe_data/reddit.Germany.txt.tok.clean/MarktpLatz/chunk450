  please provide a translation or at least a short summary . 
  again , contesting maths wo n't get you anywhere . 
  the brexit polling was too close to call prior to the referendum and inaccurate results can happen . 
  does n't change the fact that polls over all tend to be pretty accurate . 
  polling is n't `` false '' , no matter what you think . 
  they are for example useful for the politicians to see whether their policies have the approval of the populace . 
  they are important for the media to know when a part of the population changes their opinion . 
  they are important for predictability in a democracy . 
  and last but not least , they are important for strategic voting . 
   in such a way that their methodology is completely transparent . 
  at least in germany this is the case . 
  i can only imagine that it is the same way in the uk - you probably just did n't search for it . 
   i 'd forbid them from giving their summaries to the media in the familiar format ' 58 % of britons support x ' to ' 58 % of the 435/64 ,000,000 britons polled support x ; this study was financed by b co and c plc ' 1 . 
  it does not matter who finances a study as long as the polling method is fair 2 . 
  you just proved that you do not understand math - if you poll 1000 people in a representative manner , you can rightfully make the claim that `` 58 % of britons support x '' . 
  this `` how can a poll of 1000 people be accurate when we have 64,000,000 people '' is just nonsense spread by people who do not understand polling . 
   this is wishful thinking but not more atm . 
  i hope he is right but this is n't proof of anything . 
  the same study goes on to say that only 31 % of all refugees that arrived in 2013 got work . 
  31 % is actually very decent if you ask me . 
  and it is enough proof for my point that `` at least a significant share will eventually pay taxes '' . 
   does that number include family reunification ? 
  afaik it does . 
  however , family unification is very limited at the moment . 
   we are talking about possible outcomes , not what the people want . 
  it is the society that has to integrate these people . 
  if the society is not willing to support more than x people , this also becomes a theoretical limit . 
  i also only posted it on top . 
   most would be about 550.000 mio people . 
   while all of that is right i feel that it is just evading my question . 
  look at the reports - they do both show how many positions are open and some even explain why they cant find people . 
  the brexit polls actually were very close in the last days - the brexit victory was in the margin of error . 
  polls can not and do not guarantee that they represent the actual outcome . 
  the weighing in polls and the selection of the people polled can mess with the results . 
  this however would qualified as a `` flawed polling method '' and not as `` making things up '' . 
  of course they are n't . 
  but the author is a * contributor * , not a journalist employed by forbes . 
  his disclosure includes that he gets funding from most major arms companies in the us . 
  and this articles is , big surprise , calling the us equipment insufficient and demanding new and better equipment . 
  which in my opinion is a significant violation of even a glimpse of impartiality and thus a lobbying piece that has no place on this sub . 
   they just make it all up as they go along . 
  i have n't met even one sincerely pro-eu briton . 
  yeah , because your anecdotal experience is literally the only thing that matters . 
  if you take a look at the polling methods of the polling agencies , you will notice that they really do not `` just make it all up '' . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it does n't use a credible source .

  you may provide a credible source in order for this removal to be lifted . 
  this is pretty much a lobbying piece adressed at the us - europe does n't really play a significant role in this .

   i know it 's different , but it just says something about the overall desirability of ee/se . 
  true . 
   yep , but first you would have to able to catch everyone who is not in their assigned country . 
  then you would have to actually put these severe punishments in place . 
  as for now , there are no such punishments and it is n't even a discussed topic , so it does n't look like anything is gon na change any time soon . 
  even if you had those punishments , you would actually have to enforce them and for that you would need an active cooperation of all countries . 
  which is unrealistic . 
  we are talking about the unlikely scenario where we implement a continuous distribution mechanism . 
  i think in this line of thought , implementing safeguards to ensure people staying in their countries are not unlikely . 
   yes , it is possible and it is also pretty understandable , that does n't mean that such behaviour should be tolerated or even indirectly encouraged by the way your migration system is set up . 
  if germany wants to tolerate this country-shopping and thinks there should be no punishment for it , then it is your decision again . 
  i think it 's a mistake . 
  again , as i have outlined while describing the path of a refugee towards germany , it is not really a problem of the asylum system of germany . 
  the problems are located in other countries . 
  first and foremost in greece . 
   so then i suggested the detention centres . 
  i realize it sounds horrible . 
  not just sounds , it is pretty horrible . 
  i get that . 
  hovewer how else do you want to discourage country shopping ? 
  ok , so maybe not detention centres , but at least treat them differently than people coming orderly through the resettlements . 
  give them less money , give them only a temporary work-permit , rule out any possibility to ever gain a citizenship and once it 's possible to deport them , do it immediately . 
  as i have already explained to you , the monetary payments are already at their bare constitutional minimum . 
  what would be legal however is replacing monetary benefits by benefits in kind . 
  we should aim to deport as soon as possible no matter what - we can make exceptions for those who are in work or who have children attending school here . 
  to treat people of this kind differently , we would need to resettle other people first . 
  and there is little desire for this right now . 
  countries like the us , uk and australia are praising themselves for their humanitarian efforts for accouncing to resettle a few thousand people . 
   well i would hope that eu countries learnt their lesson and would not do the same mistake again . 
  i would like to hope that as well , but i simply do not believe it . 
   no , but you have to make the selection somewhere anyway . 
  you simply can not take them all . 
  so then why does it matter so much what is the selection about ? 
  why it can not be based on the sense of guilt or responsibility , cultural/religious proximity and so on ? 
  because that would kinda change the system to the worse . 
  if you base it on guilt and responsibility , you do not need an asylum system to base it on for it in the first place . 
   nowadays , the only selection is `` whoever is rich enough to pay the smugglers to get them here '' . 
  well , `` rich '' - we have seen the free market at work .
