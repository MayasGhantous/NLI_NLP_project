   imho the answer is - by forcing inner eu countries to stop giving fortune amount of money to hand new coming ` refugees ' this is legally not possible in germany . 
  before that . 
  i already talked about the online questionnaire . 
  and i know that the paper form has been abandoned recently . 
  read again . 
  when someone is a terrorist - does it really make a difference ? 
  well , it was n't that `` official '' . 
  i could not find a single source where the health expediture of the netherlands was 12.88 % in 2013 . 
  thus , this post will stay removed as the data set is dubious . 
  how do you explain that the source claims to use world bank data , yet the world bank data gives completely different numbers ? 
   most of the french are just very unhappy with the current european dynamics precisely because they get a lot of shit for doing what they feel is their prerogative . 
  germany gets criticized for pretty much everything it does . 
  the world continues moving , so whatever . 
   i for one am for a frexit because our politicians now are simply the arms of brussels . 
  not really , no . 
  some of your politicians are just incompetent . 
   in 2005 i voted no to ratifying the eu constitution . 
  my vote was not heard . 
  there is nobody but your own government to blame for this . 
  i am not telling you to do anything . 
  you are free to do whatever you want , i am free to criticize you . 
   there is no point complaining . 
  let the french do french things and let us do british things . 
  respecting other countries does not mean that we can not criticize them or make fun of them when they do stupid stuff . 
  - . - sorry , i guess i am german :(,

  wo n't run . 
  we dont have this kind of government in germany . 
  if she refused to build a coalition with someone else , the leftwing parties would have made a coalition and ruled germany . 
  the spd ruled out a coalition with the * linke * in the election campaign , but if the cdu refused to build a government , people would not have had a problem with it . 
  i am not talking about military engagements around the world . 
  proposing to kill nafta and cancelling trade talks , imposing tariffs on imports - that 's pretty isolationist and protetionist in my opinion . 
  trump wants the us to mainly focus on itself , this is very much isolationist .

  i am wondering to this day whether anyone has ever been caught by these questions . 
  yeah . 
  it 's also completely ridiculous - you have to fill it out on the web before you leave and then , on the plane , they give you a questionnaire asking the same questions again . 
  the weirdest thing is : on the paper you fill out in the plane , it is written : `` if you answer any of these questions with yes , please contact the us embassy before leaving towards the united states '' - i am on the fucking plane already .

  i hope they do n't go full retard like the us and make people answer questions like `` are you a terrorist ? 
  you have to consider that the work restrictions were somewhat justified - at the point the deal was struck , our economy was in a shape much worse than today . 
  domestic unemployment was much higher and the real wage growth was pretty much zero . 
   left - right classification is meaningless . 
  i fundamentally disagree . 
  if people say that they are `` neither right nor leftwing '' , they are usually rightwinger or populists . 
   she shifted cdu far from positions of kohl 's era , not speaking at all about adenauer . 
  society has shifted as well since then . 
  what has been the reality 60 years ago should not serve as an example for policy today . 
  we have seen progress , and that 's good . 
  and she was quite successful with that shift - she was probably the most popoular politician this country has ever seen in its history . 
  people from all political parties were voting for merkel despite them usually never voting for the cdu . 
   and afd is not a `` far right '' ; adenauer would sign at least 90 % of their program . 
  he would n't . 
  many of the positions of the afd qualify as `` far right '' - no point in arguing about that . 
  read up on adenauer . 
  you are just throwing around claims without any basis . 
   and migrants that are already in germany are a ticking time-bomb not only because some unknown percent of them are mujahidins . 
  they really are n't . 
  there 's a difference between immigrants and refugees . 
  that quote is taken out of context . 
  de maiziere did not talk about refugees but about our demographic problem in general . 
  stressing that we need to attract `` skilled workers and highly educated people '' and that we should thus make germany a more attractive country to migrate to [ through legal means ] . 
  the connection to refugees is drawn by the la times . 
  the recent [ iab polling ] ( http://doku.iab.de/kurzber/2016/kb2416.pdf ) shows a different result for the education . 
  we have seen leaders with worse temprament . 
  if he actually becomes secretary of state next year , we will see how he does . 
  it is in your interest to get a bad deal with britain ? 
  your anti-german sentiment might be blinding your eyes . 
  i know how it works and i did it exactly that way . 
  does n't change the fact that posting the content in the comments is the responsibility of the poster , not of the mod approving the post . 
  this does n't change the fact that it is a hassle we do not want to burden our users with . 
  if you want to post something , you can be expected to give the content in the comments . 
   let 's hope the people are getting this message as well . 
  if they do , they will have less incentive to look to outsiders to blame their situation on . 
  according to the politbarometer , people are ranking their personal economical wellbeing at an all-time high .

  et gotland , sweden -- the 150 swedish soldiers dispatched to this baltic sea island for short , routine training last month received an unexpected order : stay put . 
  the decision made them the country 's first permanent force here in more than a decade . 
  the deployment is officially a first step to boost sweden 's homeland defense at a moment when the baltic sea has again become a hotbed of east-west tensions , nearly a quarter-century after the downfall of the soviet union . 
  but experts say the move in gotland -- which is some 20 minutes by air to the russian coast -- carries bigger geopolitical significance : sweden has all but abandoned the neutral stance it projected during the cold war and is now firmly siding with nato and helping it shore up europe 's eastern flank , as russia builds up its military capabilities in the region .
