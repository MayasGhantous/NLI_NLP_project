  `` sweden is no longer part of any buffer zone , '' said sten tolgfors , who was swedish defense minister between 2007 and 2012 . 
  `` that 's an idea from the old days . '' while joining the north atlantic treaty organization as a full-fledged member is n't on its agenda , sweden has been moving closer to the western alliance through programs of shared training and military equipment over recent years . 
  in may , swedish lawmakers removed administrative hurdles that could have prevented nato forces from operating effectively in the country during a crisis or conflict . 
  the overhaul cleared up tax rules when nato troops are based in sweden and clarified who would care for their basic needs . 
  `` it 's at the level of who would provide the food and the toilet paper , '' said colonel oscar hull , whose department oversees military procurement at the swedish combined forces headquarters . 
  the country 's tilt toward nato comes as russian jet fighters have been increasingly cutting through swedish airspace during training exercises in the baltic , prompting an angry response from the government . 
  swedish forces also have supported nato-led missions in the balkans , afghanistan and north africa . 
  finland , which shares an 833-mile border with russia , and has traditionally followed a neutral line , is also steadily drifting toward the western alliance . 
  in july , finnish president sauli niinist\u00f6 , together with swedish prime minister stefan l\u00f6fven , attended a dinner of nato heads of states in warsaw , a rare event for non-nato members . 
  `` the continual development of military cooperation with nato is one of the key elements through which finland maintains and develops its national defense , '' said janne kuusela , head of finland 's defense policy department . 
  in sweden , defense minister peter hultqvist said his country has been and will continue to be an active partner with nato as a military nonaligned country . 
  nato said finland and sweden were among its most active partners . 
  `` we share the same values , we face the same security challenges , and we have a common approach to the security situation , '' dylan white , acting nato spokesman , said . 
  sweden and finland boast sizable army forces , and their shift toward the alliance could give it a much-needed capacity boost in the baltic area , where estonia , latvia , lithuania , and even poland have limited firepower . 
  but the disappearance of neutral parties in the region , experts say , could also create a more volatile environment . 
  during the cold war , sweden and finland sought to use their access to the u.s. and russia to ease regional tension , said sven hirdman , sweden 's ambassador to moscow between 1994 and 2004 . 
  `` finland and sweden played a fairly useful role in proposals for disarmament and detente , '' he said . 
  `` it was appreciated by both the u.s. and russia . '' sweden 's neutrality traces back to the 19th-century napoleonic wars , when the nordic country lost finland to russia . 
  throughout the cold war , sweden claimed neutrality , building up an extensive defense force independent of both the west and moscow . 
  it kept a standing army that ran into the hundreds of thousands and developed an advanced air force and navy . 
  among the main proponents of sweden 's cold war stance was longtime social democrat leader olof palme , who credited sweden 's neutrality with keeping the country out of armed conflict . 
  `` we wo n't budge a millimeter of a step when it comes to asserting our neutrality and sweden 's independence which has given us peace for 170 years , '' he said in a statement to parliament in 1985 . 
  a decade later , sweden amended its approach to neutrality when it joined the european union . 
  in doing so , it committed itself politically to supporting its neighbors in times of crisis or conflict . 
  it chose , however , to stay out of nato , in which the u.s. , the u.k. and other members have a collective duty to assist each other militarily if any state is attacked . 
  sweden 's left-leaning minority government in september restated its commitment to remain outside of the alliance after a parliament-commissioned report took an exhaustive look at the advantages and disadvantages of the country 's current stance . 
  `` our aim is to reduce tension '' foreign minister margot wallstrom told reporters at a briefing in september . 
  `` would sweden joining nato reduce tension ? 
  no it would not , '' she said . 
  russia has n't complained about sweden 's tighter relations with nato but has said a formal adhesion would be regarded as an aggressive move . 
  `` of course we in russia would take the necessary military technical measures , '' russia 's ambassador to sweden , viktor tatarintsev , told swedish radio earlier this month . 
  in the u.s. , some officials believe formally bringing sweden into the alliance could trigger a crisis with russia . 
  any move to offer membership would take months or years to approve and ratify , giving russia ample time to try to destabilize the region , the officials say . 
  on a recent saturday , swedish air force captain jorgen olsson ran a training session for fighter pilots on gotland . 
  from the communications system to the missiles under the wings of planes , the machinery is now completely in tune with nato standards , he said . 
  `` you could take any swedish squadron and put them in any nato-led operation and it would just work , '' the captain said .

   but 1 $ jobs made us more competitive 1 $ - jobs really do not make us more competitive . 
  this can be pretty much ruled out based on the rules for these jobs . 
  mini jobs were far more relevant in this regard . 
   it 's a mixed bag though -- a comparatively strong economy alone is n't enough . 
  it is n't , but significant wage increases across the board do help quite a bit . 
  the number of minijobs has been decreasing significantly in the last few years by the way - many of them were turned into jobs where you have to pay social insurance . 
   the us is the richest country the earth has ever seen , but if you leave too many people disenfranchised then it will eventually come back to bite you . 
  income inequality is a severe problem . 
  i agree with you on this . 
  this does n't change the fact that i still think agenda 2010 was the right way to go . 
  we need to fix a lot of things and the minimum wage was a good first step . 
  it just is extremely difficult to fix income inequality without going into some kind of class warfare . 
   but it deterred no one . 
  it deterred around 95 % of germans ( according to polls ) . 
  even after the election , only 11 % thought electing trump was `` good '' or `` very good '' while 82 % said that it was `` bad '' or `` very bad '' . 
   in fact his supporters perceived it as a plus , as evidence that he is not part of the regular politicians who are responsible for this stagnation or slow decline of the middle class . 
  that however is not exclusive to hitler but to populists in general . 
   i hope to god that people here are n't going to underestimate this cry for populism and change , and that campaigns wo n't rely solely on the `` fight fascism '' slogan . 
  it does n't appear to be working , and it does n't appear to be enough . 
  europe ca n't afford that kind of conceitedness and laziness . 
  i do not think we will anything that even remotely reminds of the us election campaign .

  i disagree . 
  had hillary been a better candidate ( this means less baggage ) , this would not have been an issue . 
   the exact translation is : `` around 60 % of the carceral population in france , meaning 40.000 prisoners , may be considered of muslim religion or culture '' true , i misread something,

   would you agree that the rise of the afd and other alt right elements is bad enough yes . 
  but i would differenciate between political consequences and actual consequences for the average citizen . 
  a `` nightmare '' in my book would be significantly rising crime rates or severe financial strains due to the crisis for example . 
  neither is the case . 
   and that it would n't have shaped up like this without the eu wide administrative failure during the immigration crisis ? 
  there are a few more things that played into it . 
  but generally speaking , somewhat . 
   that 's a vast majority of young men ... or i just do n't know what you need tbh again - what qualifies as a `` young man '' are males aged 14-34 . 
  i think nobody would call this into question . 
  and the share of these people is below 50 % , thus not being a `` majority '' . 
   for education , i 'll simply send you back , once again to the excel file on the unhcr website with the origin of the `` refugees '' . 
  it was just today that the first representative polling of refugees in germany was published . 
  it does n't look terrible . 
  but again , it does not matter as even if you include all educated males , you do not get to a majority . 
   they do n't come from syria . 
  check the origin tab in the excel file from the unhcr : 27061 from nigeria ( italy ) , 15648 from erithrea ( italy ) , 8745 from sudan ( italy ) , 1061 from c\u00f4te d'ivoire ( spain ) , 7052 from somalia ( italy ) , 5818 from bengladesh ( italy ) , 4099 from ghana ( italy ) , 1458 form pakistan ( italy ) and this goes on and on ... 
  the eurostat data i linked for you actually has an option to display how many people come from a certain region . 
  but that tool is quite horrible to use . 
  so i 'll make it easy for you and quote the official data from [ 2015 ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2015.pdf;jsessionid=c49e9618b59fd05e31b826915d20320c.1_cid286?__blob=publicationfile ) ( germany ) : 35.9 % syria , 12.2 % albania , 7.6 % ksovo , 7.1 % afghanistan , 6.7 % iraq , 3.8 % serbia , 2.5 % eritrea . 
  data from [ 2016 jan-oct ] ( https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl-oktober-2016.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) : 37.9 % syria , 18 % afghanistan , 13.5 % iraq , 3.6 % iran , 2.2 % eritrea , 2.1 % pakistan . 
   they are not from syria . 
  and i see no reason why they will not behave like migrants before them and no try to have their family join them . 
  as i have elaborated above , many are . 
  it does not matter what they want , what matters is the law . 
  i do not think you understand what i meant . 
  i never claimed that petry is hitler or that the afd is the nsdap ( even though they have some guys that would fit there quite well ) . 
  what matters is that there is a higher moral hurdle for voting for the far right in germany than in other countries . 
  despite the election successes of the afd - germany is still pretty much the only country ( apart from luxembourg ) with a relatively small number of votes for rightwing parties .
