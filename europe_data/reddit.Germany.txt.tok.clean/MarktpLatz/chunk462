  look at the political spectrum : 44 % of the polling is for parties left of the cdu , then theres 5 % for the fdp which is n't rightwing either . 
  plus the 34 % for the cdu , which is conservative . 
  this is a whole lot different in many other countries . 
   a little bit older : 45 % a number that was based on a poll by an american institute . 
  i would take the bbc over that any given day . 
  especially considering that it is more recent . 
  and by the way - the share of muslims has * never * been 10 % . 
   might be their culture ( religion is part of that ) . 
  might be their education . 
  but all in all , it does n't matter in the end . 
  it does since you seem to connect their religion with the fact that they are imprisoned . 
   and btw , i 'm willing to bet south-east asians are actually less likely to go to jail . 
  i do not know about that . 
  i know that in switzerland , there are only two groups of foreigners underrepresented in jails : germans and austrians . 
  their share is actually lower than the share of natives in jail . 
   here you go . 
  it 's in french i 'm afraid . 
  but it says around 60 % of thos in prison are muslims . 
  not quite . 
  60 % come from the region or culture . 
   even if the number is `` only '' 50 % or 45 % it still is staggering . 
  you still need to account for the economic realities ... 
  but yeah , it is a bit worrisome . 
  quite a lot of experts would disagree on this . 
  generally , it is assumed that his reign paved the way for the prosperity we are currently experiencing . 
  plus the unwillingness of half their members to take part in governing . 
  life is easier when you can just say random stuff but do n't have to deliver on anything . 
  this has been a nightmare for the people there , but not for germany . 
  and by the way - the events have been greatly overexaggerated . 
  the number of actual rapes ( penis in vagina ) has been three or less iirc . 
  still horrible , but not as bad as the english-speaking media and people on reddit make it to be . 
  our political system is fundamentally different . 
  the voter mentality is different . 
  and last but not least , there is our history . 
   55 % male since 01/01/2016 for only 18 % women ( the rest is made of children , and i certainly believe there 's also 4 males for every women amond those children ) . 
  uhm . 
  let me start with saying that this does not contradict my statement . 
  `` male '' does not equal `` young , uneducated male '' . 
  and i have good reason to believe that my data is superior : it is the official [ eurostat data ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-datasets/-/migr_asyappctza ) : * 1,321,600 total applications in 2015 * 953,470 males ( 72.1 % ) * 140,300 males aged 0-14 ( 10.6 % ) * 104,252 males aged 14-17 ( 7.9 % ) * 548,265 males aged 18-34 ( 41.5 % ) * 155,925 males aged 35-64 ( 11.8 % ) * 3,640 males aged 65 + ( 0,3 % ) since the official questioning is more thorough than the un data , i have no reason to doubt these numbers . 
   in france alone , family immigration ( from africa and muslims countries mostly ) is around 90.000 people / year . 
  source ? 
   some are from foreigners and some are from migrants after they get the french nationality ( still coming from africa or muslims countries ) . 
  the number of immigration mariages is very important ( muslim with the french nationality marry a foreign muslim and make them come to europe ) . 
  that 's something else however . 
  the young men currently in europe will not be able to bring their parents or siblings over here . 
  many of them have no children or wife that they could bring here . 
  simply travelling to syria , marry someone , and get that person over here will not work - you do n't get into syria that easily anymore . 
  [ she did n't ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) . 
   people vote parties , leaders are selected by parties ( by internal often undemocratic internal fight ) . 
  if the leader is not really terrible , people vote for him because he/she is supported by party . 
  the thing is : quite a decent share of voters vote cdu * because * of merkel , not because they want the cdu . 
   clintona and trump are products of deep political crisis of usa not products of system exchanging after 8 years president . 
  does n't change the fact that we would have never gotten to this point had obama been able to run again . 
   and media manipulation . 
  oh do n't be ridiculous . 
   if afd had significant success in bavaria causing csu not having majority for a single party government with what party csu would make coalition ? 
  after next 4 years merkel 's chancellorship afd could be at least 2ns strongest party in germany . 
  wait what ? 
  the csu would likely enter a coalition with the fdp . 
  afd does not have the potential to get # 2 in germany . 
  [ syria fair share analysis by oxfam ] ( https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/bn-syria-fair-shares-analysis-010216-en.pdf ) - poland is contributing 17 % of what would be a fair share . 
  your country has pledged 18 million euros for this cause - even you will agree that this is a joke . 
   my general position is not to take masses of refugees ( except for vulnerable groups ) but increase spendings to help them there.in this case even disabled and poor refugees can also live on digit level , also consider 3800 refugee deaths on sea in 2015 , that could be prevented.this needs cooperation on larger scale.i do n't think there is politicial will to do this.jordan is really safe country.unlike other countries in the region , there is no armed conflicts at all.homicide rate is also much lower at 2.0 , less than us.finally jordan is culturally much closer to syria , so no cultural shock.both countries are sunni islam majority.there are vulnerable groups like converts , atheists or christians , that in fact should be taken as refugees to europe.situation is obviously worst for converts and i do not disagree with you on this . 
  a lot of leaders actually applied this rhetoric . 
  the problem is that very few of them actually honoured their words . 
  germany , the uk and norway pledged 50 % of the last pledging conference for syria . 
  this must not happen . 
  we are certainly not the country to blame here . 
  bear in mind that we provide a lot of funding in the region while spending enormeous amounts of money at home , taking care of refugees . 
   enormous majority of those `` refugees '' are young uneducated males inaccurate . 
  the number of young males aged between 14 and 35 is 49.4 % . 
  so in fact , you are not only wrong about `` young educated males '' being an `` enormeous majority '' , even if you include those who are educated , you do n't have a majority of young males . 
   and will want their whole family to come to as soon as they are settled you do realize that there is no legal basis for this ? 
  family reunification is a rather limited tool . 
   for antisemitism essentially every poll made in syria before the war although genocidal might be going a bit far . 
  genocidal is actually a lot too far . 
  i am aware that antisemitism is widespread in that region though . 
   no reason to believe they 'd changed their minds since . 
  i am not that sure about this . 
  i just read the polling of refugees in germany today and apparently , the values of the refugees differ significantly from the values of people in the region . 
  there were no questions about jews however . 
   in belgium , 10 % of the population is muslim . 
  yet , they make up 45 % of the carceral population . 
  inaccurate . 
  its 6 % and 35 % . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36348389 ) . 
  and it is not said that it is due to religion - it might simply be due to them having a foreign background . 
  foreigners are generally much more likely to be imprisoned , no matter the religion . 
   and the justice system is so lax that to actually be imprisoned , you need to be caught several times . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that . 
   the brother of salah abdeslam was in a gang of thieves that was stealing from dead people . 
  they were caught and found guilty of several counts of stealing the dead . 
  so what ? 
   how much time in jail for someone stealing the dead with a gang ( and who is also the brother of 2 terrorist , as we found out ) ? 
  sentence : 0 days of actual jail . 
  it is completely irrelevant who your brother is as long as you do n't take part in his crimes . 
  you could be the brother of hitler - nobody should give you a higher sentence because of that . 
   those 45 % are n't behind bars for nothing . 
  they have the same kind of stats in france but are actually forbiden to count the number of muslims behind jail . 
  i 'd like a source for that .
