  lots of drugs and painkillers . 
  ^ ^ / s nah , on a more serious note , i just noticed that ridiculous/unfounded/idiotic claims are best countered by objectivity and being calm . 
  it also gets you further in life in my opinion .

  it depends on which wing of the greens will take the lead . 
  this is n't even determined before the election . 
  greens together with cdu works well in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
   without having access to the rest of the eu uhm . 
  they do n't . 
   if migrants are so great and going to be such an asset to your economy and society , why not try to keep them all in germany ? 
  germany is hypocritical , on one hand saying migrants are great , they enrich society , they will work and pay taxes , pay for our social programs , etc. 
  then they want others to take migrants and want to stop the tide of migrants . 
  if migrants are so wonderful , why not put them on planes and fly them all to germany ? 
  in case you missed it - we never took refugees because we thought it would be neat to diversify our society/get additional workers/because they are so awesome . 
  we took them in for humanitarian reasons - and out of solidarity with our european partners who were crumbling under the pressure of the refugees ( especially hungary and austria ) . 
   unfortunately , in a few year 's time their numbers will double if not triple , with family reunification + more migrants coming in as we speak this is completely inaccurate . 
   they will also then be able to move around the eu freely uhm no . 
  they wo n't . 
   i think it 's quite obvious that she 's more interested in germany than the eu , the latter is only an instrument for her to further strengthen her country she 's actually one of the politicians that is more committed to the eu than most others over here . 
  you are talking about `` the centurly '' - this is still like 84 years for india to grow . 
  and no , you are wrong . 
  this is a pretty layman view on economics . 
   and the rising economic power of the century uses it vigorously ' do you mean india or china ? 
  there is good potential for internal growth when you are not on the level of western countries yet . 
  at that point , protectionism only works if you can still take advantage of free trade in the other direction . 
  protectionism is a losing concept . 
   i doubt they will reach the majority . 
  it does n't look that bad actually . 
  that coalition is polling 1-2 % below a majority in some polls currently . 
   not if the spd will go into another black-red coalition . 
  true . 
  it 's rather that you have forgotten about the separation of power . 
  checks and balances are there for a reason . 
   eu has n't reformed anything under her ~ 11 year rule . 
  it 's almost like ... the eu consists of 27 other states that we need to work with on reforming it ? 
  germany alone can not reform the eu . 
  nor should it try to - if we want reform , we need to avoid any signs that it is forced through by germany . 
  there is already enough bad blood . 
   in france , workers have leverage that german workers do n't . 
  employers fear them , which is a good thing . 
  their demands have to be met or they can literally shut down the entire country . 
  we see at the moment how well this is working out for them . 
  there needs to be a balance . 
  when either side gets too strong , the country will suffer . 
  we 'll see about that  we are coming to take yer jobs and yer moneys . 
  sorry , i made a mistake . 
  approved now . 
  you are looking for a perfect candidate - which does n't exist , if we are honest . 
  we are stuck with the options that we have , and i would argue that this is merkel for now . 
   social corporatist instead of state driven , with a lot of private sector interference in the health sector not really , no . 
   much less workers rights and much weaker unions . 
  our unions are not ` weaker ' - at least not speaking about the past . 
  the difference is that our unions are willing to cooperate with the employers to be reasonable in wage growth and other things - and the system works . 
  for both the workers and the employers . 
  in fact , the unions even sit on the board of directors in most big companies . 
   your post is 8 months old . 
  please inform yourself better on your own leader instead of keeping this will to be blind . 
  it is still relevant as ever . 
  in fact , there have been newspaper articles recapitulating what happened around a month ago - they said * exactly * the same . 
   so , ignore + block . 
  that 's not `` calling them to come '' . 
  not even remotely . 
   how do you not interpret `` we can do this '' as please come ? 
  it was adressed at the population , not at the refugees . 
   again , enjoy your newly found ghettos . 
  we are taking efforts to prevent that . 
   still thinking she thinks she did not fuck up ? 
  in case you missed it : all european leaders are guilty of this . 
  this is not a merkel-exclusive problem . 
   children [ ... ] acquire german citizenship at birth if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit and has been residing in germany for at least eight years . 
  as i have already told you , most of the refugees do not have a permanent residence permit . 
  case closed . 
  de maiziere is still a level above everyone else ( apart from altmeier ) in terms of bureaucratness . 
   by inability to reform itself do you mean domestic opposition to ridiculous measures that disenfranchise workers , weaken unions and destroy the social safety like that labour law that caused massive protests ? 
  by that i mean * any * kind of reform . 
  frances economy is in bad shape - if you can not inflate your currency , you need to take other measures to ensure you stay competitive . 
  apart from that - german workers are off pretty well at the moment . 
  unlike their french counterparts , with 10 % unemployment . 
   what 's done is done , but what was done was negative . 
  i fundamentally disagree . 
  who are you to judge about this ? 
  there 's not much drama in there however . 
  not even talking about the fact that the german side has been unhappy about the course of the ecb over the last few years . 
   if i remember right , merkel only needed another 5 votes for a cdu majority in the parliament . 
  there was absolute no reason for a big coalition . 
  well , this would n't have happened if the fdp got a * few * more votes . 
  merkel herself was n't that happy when the cdu had an absolute majority for a while in the exit polling by the way .
