  both these examples show how a stronger europe can lead to stronger countries . 
  you ignore that a `` one-fits-all policy '' does not work in europe . 
  you could not establish a europe-wide minimum wage - the economic realities in the different countries differ too much . 
  and no , i * do * want countries to compete with each other . 
  this is n't some kind of communist union . 
   second , the european parlement needs to become a parlement , something it is not at the moment . 
  it needs to get legislative initiative and control over the commission , as a proper parlement should have . 
  this is the point where the principle of subsiiary is essentially abandoned however . 
  this is when we get very close to a federal europe - something that many people do not want , for various reasons . 
   today , the european project has become much more than that , and we should acknowledge this in its construction . 
  how so ? 
  if this really happens , this will be a * very * big win for the german economy . 
  i 'm a bit sceptical but optimistic .

  total is around 180,000 - 115k is without air force and navy . 
  this is somewhat the same level as italy .

  it would also be nonsense . 
  `` hey , i know you had your referendum but some old people that were n't elected by you decided to nullify that decision '' . 
  i am aware of these options . 
  does n't change the fact that they might become a factor .

   and the american facilities in germany are to a large degree here as a logistics hub for the us and not for the protection of germany i am aware of this . 
  but apparently us politicians are n't . 
  [ this article ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5cytz5/exclusive_donald_trumps_new_chief_strategist/ ) says essentially the same .

  only talking ground forces . 
  this does n't include navy and air force . 
  we are currently aiming at increasing the overall number again , by the way . 
   the uk is down to abound 21k , the us is down to around 30k , the german army has a strength of around 59k . 
  the uk was down to 20k in 2010 . 
  the current number is lower . 
  according to the german army , there were 3,671 british and 35,800 us troops in germany in 2016 . 
  you are also comparing apples with pears - the 60k german troops are troops that are directly fighting while your numbers include everything . 
  if you include logistics , mp , communication etc. 
  the number goes up to around 115,000 . 
   it 's probably also worth noting that there is pre-positioned kit in germany that belongs to the uk and us too , so both could ramp up their numbers quite quickly and still equip and support them . . 
  most of the equipment is long gone . 
  thank you for doing this ama , mr. pabriks !, 
  as we all noticed , there is widespread opposition towards ceta in europe . 
  often , this opposition is unfounded and simply based on wrong facts . 
  i do understand that the eu has gone great lengths to correct these claims , but it has failed to reach a large share of the populace . 
  what improvements do you think the eu should aim for in this regard ? 
  what would you think about the eu buying newspaper space in the different national newspapers to explain itself ? 
  because many people will never bother to access the information published on the eu websites .

  this does not mean that anyone is willing to use them to be honest . 
  everyone with their fingers on the nuclear trigger is well aware that it very well can be the end of the world . 
   the uk and us currently have almost as many soldiers in germany between them as germany does , and that 's after massive reductions ( and it 's getting smaller ) . 
  not even close mate , not even close . 
   you are right in saying that germany does n't have any interests in force projection at present , but it 's also probably true to say that the level of defensive capability is below what you 'd expect especially given germany 's role in the eu and nato , and i 'd probably also argue that germany is n't getting great value for money in terms of what it does spend . 
  i would agree here . 
  he was talking about quite a lot of things . 
  lets see what he does . 
  i agree . 
  but it 's pretty much the `` simplest '' way to have some vague comparison . 
  i can get where you are coming from . 
  french interventionalism and german reluctance do not really match up well . 
  which is why we ( currently ) should not aim for an eu army but increased cooperation in the non-controversial areas of our militaries .
