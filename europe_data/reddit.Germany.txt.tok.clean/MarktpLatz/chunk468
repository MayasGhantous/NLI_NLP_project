  sidenote : merkel has recently announced that we will see significant increases for our military budget , but reaching 2 % will take some time . 
  probably a decade or so - you can not increase spending that quickly and easily . 
  especially not in the german political environment . 
  the title is a bit shit , i agree . 
  the article itself is a lot more realistic . 
  there 's a bit of a difference here . 
  what we are doing is not exactly an isolationalist approach . 
  germany never wanted to get dragged into military conflicts outside europe - this does n't exactly make us an isolationist country . 
  given the `` success '' of these operations , you could as well call us resonable . 
   never has well , it somewhat has . 
  for the first 15 years after the unification , france was the most powerful country in the eu despite germany having a much bigger economy . 
  uhm . 
  ever considered that this is not in our interest anyways ? 
  we dont like to be active with our military . 
   i do n't know what germany 's excuse is though . 
  i do n't know whether it is an excuse , but general anti-military sentiment in the population and our history play a role . 
  plus we do not have any interests abroad that require force projection ( unlike the uk and france ) . 
  germany was in the middle of the cold war for 40 years - i guess it is somewhat understandable to get tired of spending large amounts of money for maintaining a large military . 
  after the cold war was over , there was no more threat for germany . 
  at least it seemed that way .

   obama , who developed a close relationship with merkel in his eight years in office , will make what promises to be a bittersweet farewell visit to berlin this week . 
  it is kind of interesting that different media sources have such a divided opinion on the merkel-obama relationship . 
  just today , there was another article talking about how obama and merkel never really got close . 
   trump has promised to do what merkel and her veteran finance minister wolfgang schaeuble have resisted for years : take advantage of an ultra-low interest rate environment to invest vast amounts of public money in modernizing infrastructure . 
  iirc trumps proposals do not include public money investments into infrastructure . 
  he wants private sector money for that .

   does that not strike you as selfish ? 
  it 's like insurance . 
  you ca n't not pay your full premiums and then claim it 's ok because if anyone needs to call on the insurance they 'll need `` bailing out '' anyway , no matter if they paid or not . 
  i never declared it to be `` fine '' to do so . 
  i just contested parents claim . 
  that is n't the point of my argument . 
  i agree with you , but there are a lot of misled arguments . 
  for example the notion that the `` us has to spend more for the defense of countries like germany '' - bullshit , the us spends as much as it does because it chooses to do so . 
  not because there is a necessity . 
  the same is true about parents claim that i was responding to : a country that spends 2 % will still need to get `` bailed out '' by its allies , no matter what . 
   but it has ~ 800 t-80s and t-90s in active service . 
  their thousands of the t-80s in storage are definitely in worse condition , most of them are older variants like the initial model or the t-80b . 
  to my knowledge , all t-80 are in storage currently . 
   just about all russian current planes are a generation behind typhoons and tornados though . 
  the mig-35 is n't yet in active service . 
  so russia is introducing generation 4.5 fighters soon , uk is already using them , and is introducing fifth-generation . 
  since we are not talking about a scenario that happens tomorrow but rather in a few years , they will be in service by then . 
   if russia goes to a war economy , that 's a different thing , they have enormous industrial capacity and if they went to a war economy , nobody could ramp up equipment as fast as russia . 
  i disagree . 
  we are not in ww2 anymore - you can not simply convert a car factory to produce t-34 instead of ladas . 
  current military equipment is quite sophisticated , increasing capacity wo n't be that easy . 
  the us is way more capable of doing so . 
  even europe could outproduce russia . 
   the soviet navy suffered more than the other branches . 
  russia has been investing heavily in navy recently , and they got a few new frigates . 
  the kirov-class battlecruiser is their real flagship . 
  russian subs have had a notorious string of failed missile launches . 
  they will get a second kirov-class cruiser back in service in the forseeable future . 
   yeah , that 's true above all else . 
  it 's one of the reasons i 'm a proponent of federalism . 
  if we had a single military consisting of the uk , germany , france , italy and others , there would be no foreign threat at all . 
  do n't forget poland . 
  but yeah . 
  are n't their battlecruisers ( of which they have two again soon ) equipped to kill a whole us carrier group on their own ? 
  i think that 's how it works in theory . 
  they have good subs 2 . 
  in the ( unrealistic ) case of a uk-russia war ( without allies ) , they could collect their forces .

   yes , they have the numbers but they 're behind in technology and training . 
  nobody denies that . 
   and russia only has some 800 third-generation tanks . 
  the t-80 counts as third-generation .
