   secondly , they may not have a lot of food or clothes , but a lot of them do have smartphones . 
  the classic `` they have smartphones , so they cant be refugees '' . 
  these guys are not fleeing from poverty , they are fleeing from war . 
  smartphones are getting very very common in the third world as they empower the people to do banking , communication and a lot more . 
  a smartphone is also very necessary in order to get here , if you dont know where you are , you are pretty much lost in todays world . 
  as i replied to the same guess , the alcohol and cigarette consumption in en par with the uk , your obesity rate is half theirs , still your expectancy is 18 months lower . 
  halting the dublin treaty is actually not an illegitimate request . 
  it has proven not to work as it essentially puts all the load on greece and italy ( for people from the south ) , poland and a few others if you are talking about the east . 
  healthcare and education are and should be provided to refugees , and for good reason . 
  i think i have seen the same picture as you , but nobody requested or even ` demanded ' free money . 
  europes growth actually does not matter . 
  predictions for a century from now are not exactly known as accurate . 
  the reliable prediction capabilities of our scientists usually do not reach for a decade . 
  and no , europeans will never be a majority unless we are talking about ethnic background here . 
  also , a mixing of races usually happens . 
  and no , we do not pay people to come here . 
   there is no plans integrating all those newcomers what do you think all the voluntary helpers are doing ? 
   will hit us hard in the future when someone like hitler comes again or we end up like south african apartheid welp . 
  probably differently calculated data . 
  denmark is the only country of western europe that has a life expectancy below 80 years , 1.5 years lower than any neighboring country . 
  you can clearly see a trend if you look to the east with decreasing life expectancy , however only denmark completely different from all surrounding countries ( and maybe portugal ) . 
  the people coming here are not fleeing from starvation . 
  the population of africa has increased in the 90s aswell , nevertheless asylum requests have been low . 
  a larger population does not necessarily result in more refugees . 
  pretty much none of the migration towards europe currently is climate migration . 
  alcohol and [ nicotine ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/ebs332_en.pdf ) consumption of denmark is comparable to the uk , the obesity rate of the uk is [ twice the one ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/0,,16818702_4,00.jpg ) of denmark ( 26 % / 13 % ) . 
  yet the uk has 1\u00a01/2 years higher life expectation . 
  i guess there is more to that . 
  whats up with denmark ? 
  nope . 
  the figure above is total . 
  depends . 
  at some point it is very possible that the other parts break away ( syria , kosovo at al. ) . 
  i estimate political and social changes in some countries to effect the numbers of refugees a lot more than pure growth of population . 
  i dont believe that the situation in countries like libya will go on like this forever . 
  the population of the world increased quite a bit between the beginning of the 90s and 2000 , yet the number of refugees in europe decreased quite a bit . 
  most of the refugees dont even come from africa though ? 
  new castle of bayreuth - [ german wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/neues_schloss_bayreuth ) its a museum . 
  however , there are castles everywhere in this area . 
  yes . 
  but thats no hard task given the shakeups of the euro crisis . 
  the euro did this too , in the early years of its existence . 
  however , given that there is still some uncertainty with the euro , a greek election ( likely ) in a month , i do not expect the euro that drastically . 
  however , i for one would appreciate the euro to rise a bit . 
  or at least very unlikely . 
  there has not been a single occasion where the euro increased by more than 10 cent in a month over the last three years . 
  the latest rise was mainly due to changed expectations on the fed . 
  i agree it is pointless . 
  both are equally deserving . 
  you are right . 
  i am aware that eritrea is a shithole in these terms . 
  despite many people claiming otherwise , people do not really leave their home countries in large numbers unless some things are going terribly wrong . 
  and i dont want to take anything from these people , nobody deserves to live in these conditions . 
  however , i still think that it is one thing to live in constant oppression with slave labor , people disappearing etc. 
  any quite another thing to live in constant fear that you will stand amidst two civil war parties shelling each other . 
  pretty much nobody from the balkans is accepted though . 
  [ asylum applicants for germany in 2015 by country of origin ( german ) ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/154287/umfrage/hauptherkunftslaender-von-asylbewerbern/ ), 
  eritrea is the # 1 of asylum applications to germany in africa though . 
  i would say syria is on another level still . 
  to my knowledge , there is no civil war in eritrea . 
  the number of eritreans applying for asylum is relatively low anyways , nothing that would really strain our system . 
  the original article gives a bit more information : the obstacle for varioufakis to join them is the fact that these people want to the return to the drachma . 
  varoufakis however thinks that the drachma did no good for greece and that they should try to keep the euro , although not at any cost . 
  good . 
  if anyone deserves asylum , its the syrians . 
  just because a certain group has a tendency to defect to isis ( if that is true ) , it does not mean that every member of them is doing so . 
  especially since he is a leader . 
  this submission does not tell us anything without context . 
  holding an ak-47 does not make him a criminal or terrorrist . 
  these colours should be the other way around . 
  it is not exactly true for germany , 0.3 can be the limit if you have have failure symptoms in that state . 
  airlines stopped providing these flights to the `` common '' people . 
  this does not make 2008 data more relevant im afraid . 
  2008 is hardly relevant data however . 
  good luck fixing syria and northern africa ... 
  election mode : activated . 
  i really hope that she is the spokesperson of syriza and not the spokesperson of the govenrment . 
  we have an airport named after franz-joseph strau\u00df . 
  no , i am implying that they are not well researched . 
  [ hitler himself said in 1939 ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=x1ykf8fx-08c&amp;pg=pa81&amp;dq=our+economic+situation+is+such+that+we+can+hold+out+a+few+more+years.....we+have+no+other+choice,+we+must+act%22.&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cceq6aewagovchmiyy-x39k9xwivr2such1eeqyk#v=onepage&amp;q=our%20economic%20situation%20is%20such%20that%20we%20can%20hold%20out%20a%20few%20more%20years.....we%20have%20no%20other%20choice%2c%20we%20must%20act%22.&amp;f=false ) : `` our economic situation is such that we can only hold out a few more years ... we have no other choice , we must act '' . 
   ohne den kriegsausbruch im jahr 1939 w\u00e4re deutschland schon bald darauf bankrott gewesen `` without the war starting in 1939 , germany would have went bankrupt very soon '' - magnus brechtken , vice president of the institute of history in munich . 
  this is not equal to ` fixing the economy ' . 
  contrary to the time after ww2 , germanys industry was pretty much intact after ww1 . 
  what is impressive is not the buildup of a large army , the thing that is impressive about is that he got through with it , that nobody of the large powers in europe stopped him before doing so . 
  the currently largest superpower is able to pay its debts . 
  it is borrowing in the leading world currency and not some currency that is artificially fixed . 
  but he certainly did not leave with the left platform , that would have been like the biggest headline ever . 
  makes me ask why he didnt leave , what he said in this interview is essentially praising the left platform for sticking with their ideals and not going the way tspiras went . 
  about that picture - [ varoufakis literally gives zero fucks ] ( http://i1.web.de/image/004/30801004,pd=3,f=lead-xl/varoufakis.jpg ), 
  no i didnt think that . 
  well , i am not going to call him the devil or something as my knowledge on the stuff that happened in your country is very slim . 
  anyways , we have completely shifted away from the original topic of this discussion . 
  which was you praising the economic success of hitler . 
  do you still stand with that theory ? 
  i did never claim that you are a hitler supporter , i simply think that you are failing to see the other side , the same thing that you are requesting . 
  you are talking about hitlers economic success yet fail to see that he did no such thing as ` fixing ' our economy . 
  he simply inflated it with debts . 
  germany would have been bankrupt a few months/years after it declared the war . 
  the reichsmark never got any kind of international reputation . 
  the same for the impact on india .
