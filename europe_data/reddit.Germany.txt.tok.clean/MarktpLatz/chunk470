   he has 2 monts left , he should shut up . 
  how about no ? 
   imf is not a branch of the state . 
  its a private consortium . 
  does n't change the fact that it is us money that was lent to greece with agreement of the us . 
   barack hosein obama is on the way out so he should shut up not really . 
  why putting emphasis on the `` hosein '' anyways ? 
  it 's not like he uses that name . 
  this term was almost exclusively used in shitty websites to claim that `` obama is a secret muslim '' . 
   2 bhos country didnt lend a y money so hebshould shut up they did - through the imf . 
   van der bellen will lose the re-election this would imply that this election is ever going to happen . 
  turkey is the only country that i would consider to pull this off .

  well . 
  yes , it is a reputable , serious news source . 
  but no , it is not a newspaper . 
  it is simply the foreign broadcaster of the german state . 
  it is funded by the government , yet entirely independent . 
  i disagree . 
  germany will not get nukes no matter what . 
  france and the uk already have nukes . 
  i doubt that italy and spain are willing to spend the money to develop nukes given their budget itssues . 
  even if every european country was spending 2 % - including the us in a mutual defense would be guaranteed . 
  you also did n't adress any of the points i made . 
  he called nato into question while doing that . 
  which has rightfully been a big no-go until now . 
  it does not matter why he said it - what matters is that he did . 
  and it is also factually inaccurate . 
  contrary to the rhetoric that is often applied , the us does not have troops in germany to defend the country . 
  the troops that are still here serve american interest first and foremost . 
  us military spending was way below current levels just 20 years ago - they increased their spending significantly due to the iraq war . 
  there is a single reason why the us spends as much on defense as it does - because it chooses to do so . 
  preventing congress from overspending on equipment that the us military does n't even want would do much more to `` fix '' us military spending .

  you do realize that greece is still `` operating on a net loss ? '', 
  - you have never posted a post-interest-payment surplus . 
  it is only natural that your debts go up . 
  i would also like to know where you get your numbers from - in 2010 , greece had a debt/gdp ratio of 148.3 % ( gdp : 299.6 bn usd ) , nowadays the debt/gdp ratio is higher but the gdp is also lower . 
  given your deficite , this makes quite a lot of sense . 
  do n't worry , i am not scared that easily and i certainly do n't feel personal guilt in this case . 
  the reason why i have not been replying is that i am on mobile currently and thus unable to provide you with sources . 
  i agree that it is in fact a very serious claim , that 's why i did not want to reply without looking for a source first . 
  i 'll get back to you tomorrow , okay ? 
  you should probably look into what trump said during the election campaign - it was a bit more than just asking other nations to meet 2 % . 
  uhm . 
  so what ? 
  wrong . 
  the uk does not really import us built cars at all . 
  and that wo n't change after brexit . 
  the us branded cars sold in the u.k. are almost exclusively built in the u.k. or continental europe . 
  the cars that are manufactured in the us are manufactured for the american market - different details ( due to regulation ) , lower quality ( due to lower car prices in the us ) , built for completely different roads . 
  you do realize that , if the money was used to pay back loans , you had and likely spent the money already , at the point where you took that loan ? 
  take schulz ' visit to the knesset a while back for example . 
  i would also say that germany has a responsibility to protect israel . 
  there are a lot of areas where cooperation is possible and desirable . 
  however this does not mean that we have to remain quiet about things we disagree on . 
  unfortunately , there have been some israeli politicians calling any kind of criticism from germany `` anti-semitic '' and claiming that `` germans do not have the right to criticize israel '' . 
  i 'd say yes . 
  more of a moral obligation though . 
  that 's a rather vague backing for your claim . 
  this is how democracy works . 
  if people are n't willing to vote , it is their own fault . 
  uncasted votes bear no weight in this . 
  brexit was bigger than ukip 3 . 
  the only reason why ukip only has a single seat is a flawed election system . 
   he could n't get the eu to agree with ttip . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  ttip is not even finished , there was never a vote on it . 
  in case you missed it : one of the main obstacles of ttip remains that the us is not willing to scale down protectionist measures . 
  source ? 
  if you see a demonstration and they are flying german flags , you can be 99 % sure that they are right-wingers . 
  flying a german flag in your garden is tolerated . 
  the exception is football - we all go mad during world cups when it comes to flags . 
  that 's why i wand labour to be a constructive opposition - do not fundamentally challenge the brexit decision but attack bad policy proposals connected with it , propose legislation that would soften or solve the problems arising . 
  you can hardly call this `` swept under the rug '' . 
  it would help the country a fair bit if labour tries to help the government in making the brexit a success instead of fighting it . 
  it is the country of all brits after all , nobody profits when the country goes to shit . 
  the fundamental decision ( brexit ) has been made , now it matters in what way you exit the eu . 
  generally i would be inclined to agree with you , but we have a legitimate referendum here . 
  there simply is no other way than putting it . 
  labour not obstructing the process will , in my opinion , help to heal the divide . 
  labour opposing brexit has the potential to fundament a political split in the country . 
  opposition means a lot of things , including actually agreeing with the government if you think they are making the right decision , no matter if this results in voters that do n't get represented . 
  and given the referendum result , backing brexit seems to be a reasonable thing to do . 
  opposition does not mean that you have to be opposed to everything the government does . 
  judging by documents provided by wikileaks , the nsa tapped the phones of 69 people , half of them from the ministry of economic affairs between 2010-2012 . 
  this includes the minister himself and his head of office . 
  another document shows that the nsa wiretapped conversations merkel had her close staff concerning greece during a visit in vietnam . 
  [ german source ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/nsa-wikileaks-101.html ), 
  according to major german news , greece will hold elections on the 20th of september . 
  according to a poll conducted by the `` forschungsgruppe wahlen '' , a majority of germans think that we are capable of handling the numbers of refugees despite the numbers being adjusted to 800,000 refugees this year . 
  ( the poll was conducted between the 18th and 20th of august , the number of 800,000 reached the media on the 19th if i am not mistaken , the former expectation was 650,000 ) . 
  | yes | no -- | -- | -- | -- | -- can germany handle the influx of refugees ? 
  ( now ) | 60 % | 37 % can germany handle the influx of refugees ? 
  ( 4 w. ago ) | 54 % | 41 % handle refugees differently based on their chance of staying | 74 % | 23 % germany is a country of immigration | 86 % | 12 % germany is in need of an immigration act | 77 % | 18 % give benefits in kind instead of money to refugees | 69 % | 26 % if the above was implemented , less people would come here | 35 % | 61 % the poll also asked some questions about the greek situation | yes | no -- | -- | -- do you agree with the third bailout package for greece ?
