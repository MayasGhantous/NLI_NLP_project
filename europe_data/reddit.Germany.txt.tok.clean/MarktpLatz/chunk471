  [ removed ], 
  since it is a topic that is frequently discussed on this sub ( in fact it comes up in pretty much any thread concerning the refugee crisis ) i thought it would be useful to write a longer post about it where i will try to put all facts together so everybody can make up their mind independently from the mainstream narrative or the media . 
  i acknowledge that i am far from an objective person on this issue . 
  i have been pretty vocal about my opinions on the topic , thus i am aware that many people here will meet this post with suspicion . 
  to counteract this , i will try to work with reliable sources whereever possible , english sources where available . 
  -- -- -- ** what was germany 's status before merkels announcement/statement ? 
  ** * in the whole of 2014 , there were 626,960 asylum appliactions in the eu countries , 202,645 in germany . 
  this marked an increase of almost 60 % compared to 2013 , or an increase of 160 % to 2012 . 
  [ source : eurostat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dkhjxaj.jpg ) * in the first eight months of 2015 ( so before merkel made a statement ) , germany had 263,085 asylum applications ( which is already more than we had in the whole of 2014 ) . 
  [ source : eurostat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xeapdrg.jpg ) * dublin rules were officially still in place , but generally not enforced in regards to greece . 
  reason : both german courts and the ecj prohibited it to deport to greece based on greece not being able to offer a humane treatment to its refugees . 
  [ ecj case c-4 / 11 ] ( http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=144489&amp;pageindex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=757511 ) . 
  as a result , it was impossible to enforce dublin . 
  * third week of august ' 15 : in a meeting between the ministry for migration and refugees , the ministy of interior affairs and the federal states , the question about the refugees from hungary arises . 
  all parties agree that we would put hungary in a bad situation if we strictly applied dublin and sent back all refugees into a country that was already struggling severely . 
  reminder : in the first eight months of 2015 , hungary continuously had significantly more asylum applications than any other european state , including sweden and germany . 
  in august , hungary had more total asylum applications than germany depite having an eighth of the population . 
  [ source for the numbers : eurostat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6zidrva.jpg ) * aug. 25th : the german ministry for migration and refugees ( bamf ) tweets [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/bamf_dialog/status/636138495468285952 ) . 
  it translates to : `` we are at present largely no longer enforcing #dublin procedures for syrian citizens . '' . 
  this was actually not meant to be published , it was essentially just an assessment of the factual situation . 
  neither merkel nor her office knew about this happening . 
  * sept. 3rd : the federal government publishes a statement that dublin iii still applies , despite what the previous tweet of the bamf said . 
  [ link to the statement ] ( https://www.bundesregierung.de/content/en/artikel/2015/09_en/2015-09-02-fluechtlinge-dublin-verfahren_en.html?nn=709674 ) * sept. 3rd : hungary is stopping all trains en route to germany . 
  refugees trying to make the journey by foot . 
  * sept. 5th : orb\u00e1n claims that the situation is no longer under control in a telephone conference with merkel and faymann . 
  germany and austria agree on letting the trains leave hungary , transit through austria to germany to relieve pressure . 
  it is meant to be a one-time action . 
  merkels office announces that we will not reject the people coming here from hungary . 
  * sept. 13 : germany reintroduces border controls . 
  [ source for the hungary decision , merkel not knowing about the tweet , telephone conference , border controls ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-09/angela-merkel-refugees-crisis-chancellor/seite-4 ) -- -- -- ** what did merkel actually say ? 
  ** probably the most repeated sentence of the whole crisis is merkels ` we can do it ' . 
  it will be up to the historians of the future to evaluate whether this was actually true for the reality . 
  the statement originates from merkels annual summer press conference which was about a multitute of issues . 
  i unfortunately could not find a full english transcript and it is way too long to translate it for this post , but i will translate the relevant passages . 
  ** merkel ** : * most of us fortunately do not know the state of complete exhaustion , combined with fear for ones life or for the life of ones family . 
  people that are coming here from eritrea , syria or northern iraq have to endure situations and fear that would let us collapse straight up . 
  therefore , when it comes to dealing with these people , we have to ensure that some core principles find application . 
  these principles origniate from no lesser source than the grundgesetz , our constitution . 
  * * first : the fundamental right of asylum applies to people that flee political persecution . 
  we can be proud about the humanity of our constitution . 
  this humanity especially finds expression in this article [ the right of asylum ] . 
  we grant protection for all of thise that flee wars . 
  they deserve protection as well . 
  * * the second principle is the human dignity of the individual . 
  this is a core principle that article 1 of our constitution mandates us to follow [ note : this article can not be changed ] . 
  no matter whether someone is a natural citizen or not , no matter why and from what country someone comes to us , no matter what prospects his application for asylum has - we will respect the human dignitiy of every human inside our borders and we will use the full force of the constitutional state against those that mob other people , that attack other people , that commit acts of arson against their accomodations or want to exercise violence . 
  [ ... ] there will be no tolerance towards those who question the human dignity of other humans . 
  [ ... ] * * i will also say : nevertheless , we still live in a good country . 
  the state of the nation is good !, 
  the civil society , often mentioned , is reality here and i am proud and thankful to see how countless people in this country are reacting towards the arrival of refugees . 
  the number of those that care for refugees in the current day , the number of people who give a helping hand dwarfs the number of the xenophobes and rabble-rousers . 
  [ ... ] * * in the near future , we will implement new legislation that increases the speed of processing the applications . 
  we need more capacity to house refugees . 
  we need to be determine quickly who has a good chance to stay here and who does n't . 
  we have to make decisions quickly so that we can deport those who have been rejected quickly . 
  [ ... ] * * i will just say : * ** germany is a strong country . 
  the mentality that we have to apply to this issue has to be : we managed to do so much in the past - we will do this !, 
  ** * we will do this , and whereever we meet obstacles in our way , we have to work to overcome them . 
  the federal government will do all that is in its power to do this . 
  * * there then is the european dimension , and i think we are allowed to say : europe as a whole has to move . 
  the states have to share the responsibilities for refugees coming here . 
  the universal civil rights have been closely connected to europe and its history . 
  this was one of the main founding principles for the eu . 
  should europe fail to adress this crisis , this connection will break loose . 
  [ ... ] * * there is little value in publically shifting the blame , but we have to say : the current situation is not satisfactory . 
  the ministers of interor affairs will meet on sept. 14th . 
  the heads of states are ready at all time . 
  the topics are countries of safe origin , hotspots in italy and greece , a fair distribution . 
  the topic will be quotas inside europe , that will not only take population into account but also economic strength . 
  a little bit of fairness . 
  * * there is a third point that we have to consider : [ bring peace to syria and surrounding countries , help these countries ] [ ... ] * ** merkels statement ends here and is followed by a q&a ** ** m : ** * `` there is a high level of agreement that we need to relieve pressure from italy . 
  it is not possible to say that all refugees who arrive there have to stay in italy just because they came via the mediterranian sea . 
  the dublin agreement is not working like it used to because the circumstances have changed . 
  as a result , it is important that every one of has to engage for europe and mutuality , then we will move forwards . 
  '' * [ ... ] ** m : ** * i think it is fine that the v4 are holding meetings on the issue . 
  there are meetings between germany and france or italy , i have no objections . 
  * [ ... ] ** m : ** ** concerning the question of dublin iii : dublin iii is the regulation that is in force , thus i greatly appreciate hungary registering the refugees - something that not all countries are doing , one has to say ; hungary is doing this very well . 
  i think it created a certain amount of confusion when we had an inner debate in germany where several federal states stated that syrians have to be decided very quickly as pretty much all of them are genine refugees fleeing a war zone . 
  the head of the office for migration and refugees subsequently stated : yes , syrians will be identified , afterwards they will have a very quick procedure to be accepted as a civil war refugee . 
  this has resulted in the creation of the following impression : if a syrian comes to germany and can identify himself as syrian , he is welcome in germany . 
  this is in fact the reality , in the same way that someone from kosovo most likely wo n't be allowed to stay . 
  this has created the wrong assumption that all syrians should come to germany . 
  this however is not the state of the law and we have already told this to the hungarian government which has to deal with the phenomen of syrians inside its borders saying `` let us go to germany '' . 
  it is not the case that we could simply diverge from dublin iii , we do n't have any other treaty on the issue . 
  but if one country is building fences , a second country is allowing everyone to transit and a third country is n't registering everybody anymore , one has to say : if this state is the reality , we have to attempt to find a better one , a state where law and acting are in accordance again . 
  but the legal basis for us and for the hungarian government is the one that is in force today [ dublin iii ] . 
  ** one of the main issues is that all that merkel said on the issue has been reduced to a few sentences which fail to carry everything she said . 
  merkel is often quoted with very strong statements on this regard where her actual statements have been a lot more nuanced . 
  as a result , it is not surprising that people might have misunderstood it as some kind of invitation . 
  [ link to the transcript of the whole press conference , in german ] ( https://www.bundesregierung.de/content/de/mitschrift/pressekonferenzen/2015/08/2015-08-31-pk-merkel.html ) [ here 's the english summary of the press conference ] ( https://www.bundesregierung.de/content/en/artikel/2015/08_en/2015-08-31-sommer-pk-der-kanzlerin_en.html ) . 
  unfortunately they completely missed to write about the limitations merkel talked about . 
  -- -- -- ** what impact did merkel 's statement have on the refugee numbers ? 
  ** this is up for debate . 
  the numbers of asylum applications alone indicate no significant increase of the numbers . 
  there however is one thing that needs to be said about these numbers : they do not match the actual influx of people . 
  by the end of 2015 , the german authorities were totally overwhelmed by the numbers of asylum applications , they were unable to process people in a short period of time . 
  as a result , the actual numbers are higher than the graph indicates .
