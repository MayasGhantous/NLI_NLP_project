  the influx peaked above 10k people coming into germany per day at some days . 
  so if we just look at the trend between may and september of 2015 : the monthly increase in asylum applications was around 25,000 even prior to germany 's official statements . 
  if this trend would have continued , it would have looked like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ybpjyi.jpg ) , which would n't have been unrealistic . 
  given the numbers that are public , i would assume that the actual numbers for december have been between 240 and 320k ( for the whole of europe ) . 
  which shows a gap of ~ 100k people to my projection . 
  it is very possible that germany 's statements and actions worked as a catalyst for the numbers and are thus cause for a large share of this disparity . 
  this would also be in corellation with the german estimates for 2015 . 
  prior to the statements , the german government estimated 800,000 people for 2015 , we ended up with ~ 200k more . 
  however , there is no way to reliably estimate this . 
  we will likely never know . 
  the unhcr numbers indicate that the gap might have been even lower : [ source ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php ) it is worth noting that there was more stuff happening at the time of merkels statement : assad increased forced conscription while the government made it easier for syrians to obtain passports . 
  this might also have had a significant impact on the numbers . 
  however , it is not possible to deny that some people , like this [ syrian fella ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/3kos3j/iama_syrian_immigrant_in_germany_ama/ ) took it as an invite . 
  the people that came here before came without any kind of ` invite ' , many ( as you well know ) were promised by traffickers that they would be granted a house , a job and money over here . 
  promises that turned out to be wrong . 
  my point is : these people did not rely on some kind of invite to come here . 
  it is not out of question that the numbers would have increased without any statement .

  ** it would indeed be unconstitutional for germany to declare that there is an upper limit for asylum applications . 
  the constitution states who is eligible for asylum , it does not give an upper limit for applications . 
  [ relevant section of the fundamental rights part of the german constitution ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0088 ) . 
  it would be possible for the government to change this article ( they could likely even abolish the right of asylum alltogether , it is not one of the elements in our constitution that can not be changed ) , however there would not be a sufficient majority for doing so . 
  it works pretty much the same way as unemployment benefits : if people have valid claims for benefits , the government has to grant the people benefits , it ca n't say that it is paying benefits for three million people but will make no payments to additional people . 
  the only thing that would in reality change this if the actual capabilities of the government were exhausted . 
  this also applies to the right of asylum . 
  it however is worth noting that only 0.3 % of the people coming here were actually accepted under `` asylum '' based on art . 
  16a of the german constitution since most of them are not `` persecuted on political grounds '' . 
  the most common status that the people coming here are granted is `` refugee status '' . 
  refugee status is based on \u00a7 3 of the german asylum law ( which unfortunately does not have an english translation ) . 
  this law is based on the constitution and several international agreements and agreements with the eu ( 2011/95/eu , 2004/83/ec ) . 
  the biggest problem with changing this law would be the fact that it would likely violate the mentioned eu agreements . 
  from a purely national standpoint , it could be changed . 
  but here is the problem : we can not really leave people in legal limbo . 
  even if we abolished all laws that allow someone to be granted some kind of refugee status : we could still not deport the people . 
  we can not deport them to greece , we can not deport them to syria or iraq ( for obvious reasons ) , we can not deport them to turkey because the agreement with turkey ( that is already in place ) will enter into force in 2017 or 2018 if i am not mistaken . 
  until we have an agreement with turkey , we have no other option but processing everyone who comes here . 
  conclusion : there are only two ways that would solve these issues : * ** option one : ** closing the border . 
  however given the length of our borders , it seems unlikely that we can fully guard every part of the green border . 
  even if the border was formally closed - whoever gets through will likely be accepted as an asylum seeker for the reasons i mentioned above . 
  at the moment where you are applying for asylum , the crime of violating our border is healed . 
  due to historical reasons , germany will build no fences or even walls . 
  * ** option two : ** a agreement with turkey . 
  nobody would be stuck in legal limbo if we could deport people back to turkey . 
  this would be lawful according to european , international and german law . 
  ( well , we could deport to greece in case they improve the conditions significantly , but this seems unlikely . ), 
  it also does not require us to change any laws .

  -- -- -- ** what about the german `` welcome culture '' ? 
  ** watched with suspicion by many people inside and outside germany , germany presented itself as a country that is very welcoming to refugees . 
  starting from the general attitude of the country ( a significant majority of germans was supportive of doing so in most of 2015 ) over [ people welcoming the refugees at the train stations ] ( https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2015/09/07/fluechtlinge-empfangen-und-nazis-verjagen-dortmund-hat-es-am-wochenende-vorgemacht-909-body-image-1441635252-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&amp;output-quality= ) with applause and food , and last but not least the population [ donating large amounts of clothes ] ( http://www.ln-online.de/var/storage/images/ln/lokales/ostholstein/willkommenskultur-und-hilfsbereitschaft/279600572-1-ger-de/willkommenskultur-und-hilfsbereitschaft_artikelquer.jpg ) and other things , volunteering in integrating and [ educating the refugees ] ( https://www.lkgi.de/images/bilder/news/2015_08_24_sprachkurse.jpg ) . 
  it is very obvious that these were very powerful pictures . 
  people getting applauded when they leave the train is a strong sign of appreciation that these people are here . 
  the pictures of this went around the world , and , most critically , they reached the ( social ) media of the people in the arab world . 
  we however have to take a closer look . 
  these welcoming `` rallies '' ( if you want to call them that ) have not been organized by the government , in fact they often were relatively spontanious . 
  every state has a given share of people who would want to take all the worlds ' poor into their country . 
  these people can be very vocal at times . 
  i can somewhat understand people that dislike this behaviour , but i refuse to be critical of the other things . 
  providing people that just finished an exhausting journey with food , drinks , diapers etc. 
  is not wrong . 
  it 's the opposite - it 's the right thing to do . 
  donating things to those who have left everything behind is also a decent humane gesture . 
  and last but not least , engaging in integration and education of people who will likely stay here for at least a few years are extremely benefitial for society , for the country and for the people that come here . 
  even if they can not stay here forever , things like this reduce the negative impact these people can have on our society and economy . 
  people that get integrated have a lower chance of committing crimes , a lower chance of being a burden to the country . 
  yes , it might be an incentive for other people to come here . 
  but hell , i am willing to pay that price if it means that it will be less burdensome to us . 
  again : pretty much all of this was done by private people , there is pretty much no way for the government to prevent this , even if they wanted to . 
  in some occasions , the regional governments took part in this themselves : [ this was a ministry in lower-saxony ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/nieders%c3%a4chsisches_umweltministerium_transparent_refugees_welcome.jpg ) . 
  it was however led by the green party , generally known for their pro-refugee stance and they are not in a coalition with merkels party in that state . 
  edit : added unhcr numbers, 
  according to [ afp ] ( https://www.afp.com/de/nachrichten/26/deutsche-bank-erreicht-deutliche-senkung-von-strafzahlung-den-usa ) ( in german ) , deutsche bank has reached a settlement with us authorities , reducing the demand of $ 14 bn to $ 5.4 bn . 
  according to insiders familiar with the matter , the settlement will be made public in the next few days .

  ** short summary : ** today , on the 4th of december 2016 , italy will hold a referendum on a constitutional reform . 
  the aim is to reform the italian political system by severely limiting and changing the power of the senate . 
  many people and experts have been critical of this reform , calling it a threat to democracy and stating that it is badly drafted . 
  the pushing force behind the referendum is the leader of italy , [ matteo renzi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matteo_renzi ) . 
  renzi had connected his personal future as pm of italy with the referendum but later stepped back from that suggestion . 
  it is widely expected that renzi will resign if it fails however . 
  according to a recent ipsos poll , a majority of italians consider the referendum to be a vote on the work of renzis government rather than the reform itself . 
  both houses of the italian legislative system ( senate and chamber ) have approved the amendment , but they failed to reach a 2/3 majority . 
  for this case , the italian constitution provides the tool of a public referendum to approve the changes to the constitution ( art . 
  138 of the [ constitution ] ( https://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/istituzione/costituzione_inglese.pdf ) ) . 
  in this referendum , a simple majority suffices . 
  the question for the referendum is : `` are you in favour of implementing the constitutional law concerning * provisions to overcome the dual-parliamentary system , reducing the number of mps , reducing the cost for the functioning of the institutions , abolishing the [ cnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_council_for_economics_and_labour ) and revising title v of part ii of the constitution * , which was approved by the parliament and published in the law gazette of the republic nr .

  ** wait , did n't that election already happen ? 
  ** yes , it did . 
  the original election happened on the 24th of april 2016 . 
  six people ran for office , but none got a majority . 
  [ norbert hofer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norbert_hofer ) ( 35 % ) of the [ fp\u00d6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_party_of_austria ) and [ alexander van der bellen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_van_der_bellen ) ( 21 % ) of the [ austrian green party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_greens_%e2%80%93_the_green_alternative ) qualified for the run-off vote . 
  this vote took place on may 22nd . 
  van der bellen reached 50.3 % and hofer reached 49.7 % of the vote . 
  turnout was 72.2 % . 
  the fp\u00d6 ( hofers party ) challenged the election result in front of the [ austrian constitutional court ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitutional_court_ ( austria ) ) based on violations of the election law . 
  the court ruled that the election was void due to the fact that postal votes were handled wrongly and that first results were published before the election was over .
