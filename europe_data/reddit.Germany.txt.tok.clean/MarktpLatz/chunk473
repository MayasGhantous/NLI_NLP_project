  there is no evidence for any manipulations however , the chance that the result would have been a different one without these problems is close to non-existent . 
  the court ordered a re-run of the second round of the vote ( hofer v. van der bellen ) . 
  it was originally planned for october 2nd , but they had issues with the glue on the postal vote ballots so it was postponed to december 4th - today .

  ** background : **  legislative elections are scheduled to be held in romania on 11 december 2016 . 
  elections will be held according to new rules , following the amendment of electoral legislation during 2015 . 
  the legislation provides the return to election by list , last used in the 2004 elections . 
  the new electoral legislation provides a norm of representation for deputies of 73,000 inhabitants and 168,000 inhabitants for senators , which will lead to a decrease in the number of mps . 
  466 parliamentary seats ( 308 deputies , 18 minority deputies , and 134 senators ) will be contested , versus 588 parliamentarians who had been elected in 2012 . 
  the diaspora will be further represented by four deputies and two senators , a premiere consisting in the introduction of vote-by-mail for this type of elections .

  the point of this series is to have our fellow europeans spread their knowledge/opinion about the various european countries . 
  we have [ done this before ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1g16kp/index_of_the_series_what_do_you_know_about/ ) ( credits to / u/taenk ) , but this was three years ago , when this subreddit had a mere 35,000 subscribers .

  the country is split in three regions - the wallonian region , the flemish region and the brussels region . 
  the country is widely known for its waffles , fries and beer . 
  so , what do ** you ** know about belgium ?

  we are more than delighted to announce that we will have a culture exchange with / r/india on the upcoming thursday ( 12/01/2017 ) !, 
  we hope that this will create an opportunity for the users of both subs to learn about each others lifes , to make interesting discoveries about culture , daily life or politics - or simply ask whatever you always wanted to ask . 
  despite having a somewhat interwoven history , general knowledge in europe about india is rather lackluster , use this chance to learn more about this very unique and interesting country and its people !, 
  for that one day , we will also loosen the rules for submissions on this sub a bit . 
  additionally to the general content about europe , we will also allow content about india ( on thursday ! ) . 
  in fact , that kind of content is highly encouraged . 
  -- -- -- because of the exchange , there will be no [ `` what do you know about [ country ] '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/what_do_you_know_about_country ) post during this week , this series will be resumed next week . 
  hey guys , as promised a few days back , we are having a cultural exchange with / r/india today !,
