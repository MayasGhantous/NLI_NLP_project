  the main focus of the article is syria however . 
  if you have an article discussing more sanctions because of it , fine , but this is about something else . 
  we did n't accept articles on the air strikes either , despite it having an impact on us .

   favored by m\u00e9lenchon and backed by the un , simply because you see it as unrealistic i see no development that would me cause to change my mind on this . 
  assad is stronger than he has been over the last few years right now , which decreases the likelyhood of this happening . 
   just because `` right now '' it 's more realistic to bomb and scheme does n't mean we ca n't agree that getting around a table would be better and working toward that goal would benefit everyone . 
  the two are n't incompatible , they 're just different timeframes . 
  agreed . 
  but then , the justification for m\u00e9lenchons criticism of trumps actions are invalid in my opinion . 
  what does he expect merkel and hollande to do ? 
  condemn the bombings ? 
  would n't change a thing and could be twisted into them endorsing assad/a no-consequence policy for using chemical weapons . 
   i agree , but under whose directive ? 
  russia and the us playing chess ? 
  what do syrians have to say in the matter ? 
  that 's a very complicated issue which m\u00e9lenchon has n't answered either as far as i know . 
   like , why ca n't we form a coalition that focuses on eradicating isis in syria and dividing the won territories among assad/rebel groups , then focus on assad/rebels peace after that ? 
  because that is n't how this works . 
  the stronger party will take the territories , this is n't something we can distribute at our will . 
  and again , we would have to include russia , and for them giving land to rebels is n't acceptable ( given the dubious nature of some of the rebel groups , this is n't acceptable to us either ) . 
   who benefits from letting isis have so much leeway ? 
  can we follow that thread and see were it leads ? 
  it 's not like we are n't doing anything to fight isis . 
  in fact , pretty much the whole western engagement of own military in syria has been focussed against isis . 
   no war was won through bombing world war two was n't ended by a round table of hitler , roosevelt , churchill and stalin . 
   if we bomb , what is our objective ? 
  that 's a legitimate question , but it does n't make m\u00e9lenchons stance any better . 
   if we want to end the conflict , when are we sending troops ? 
  you can majorly impact a conflict without putting boots on the ground . 
   put assad , rebel groups ( not isis , they 're terrorist and do n't get a seat ) , local actors around the table , and find a way to end the conflict , most likely through elections . 
  it 's not like we have n't tried that . 
  the main flaw here is that assad has no reason to negotiate with russian backing and that the rebels make assad stepping down a condition for even starting the talks .

  for what reason should we stand up to trump for bombing a murderous regime ? 
  what is m\u00e9lenchons proposing to do instead with syria ? 
  what do you want to tell us with this statement ? 
  this is n't the first time we are doing this and we will likely play more rounds once the current one is over . 
  i can not promise you that there will be a slot left however . 
  but it might be worth a try for you . 
  simply join the discord ( linked in the sidebar ) and ask a moderator to be given access to the eu4 channel . 
  it is n't sure yet whether we will have a game next sunday due to easter , but you can be certain that we will continue afterwards . 
  yeah . 
  usually it 's every sunday 18-21 cet . 
  dozens of / r/europe users playing [ europa universalis iv ] ( http://www.europauniversalis4.com/ ) together in a multiplayer game . 
   i 'm fond of the `` what happened in your country this week '' threads , so every time you unstick them to make an announcement of that game , i notice . 
  it happens quite often .
