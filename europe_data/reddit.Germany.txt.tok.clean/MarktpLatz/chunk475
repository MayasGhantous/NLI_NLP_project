  unfortunately there is n't a log of stickied posts , is it ? 
  usually , those are unstickied in favor of election stickies . 
  we try our best to put the `` what happened '' stickies back on as soon as we have a slot again . 
   how many people play that game ? 
  depends on the week . 
   you are the posting the announcements . 
  spamming , one could say , if you were n't a mod , eh ? 
   this is the only game announcement i have ever posted actually . 
   sure , that 's a good thing . 
  i guess nobody is upset you brought the games back . 
  i 'm talking about the announcements . 
  that 's why i proposed you guys have your own subreddit . 
  as you might have seen in this thread , many people are n't even aware of the games happening and showing iterest . 
  nobody is going to check a dead sub just for games of this kind . 
  this would be a way to ensure that these games are going to die eventually . 
   the only thing that bothers me is that you routinely unstick other threads to put yours . 
  for example ? 
   also , the fact that the only reason this special interest group 's posts are allowed and stickied it 's because you are a mod . 
  i 'm not even the one handling these games . 
  in fact , i am not even playing in them . 
  what matters is that we had demand to bring these games back and we did . 
  no reason to be upset about it . 
  usually - yes . 
  every sunday 18-20 cet . 
  we do not know whether there will be a game next week as it is easter though . 
  nah , i rather mean the origin of the games on there often is n't that clean . 
  you have a high chance that you either support someone who used a stolen credit card or that the developer does n't see a cent of money for the game . 
  this is our `` own subreddit '' . 
  the point is n't playing eu4 , the point is playing eu4 with people from this sub . 
  why are you bothered by an occasional sticky about it ? 
  nobody forces you to participate . 
  g2a is shady as fuck tho . 
  you still have a possibility to join for the next game i guess .

  just watch out for the sticky on sundays . 
  it is usually put up around noon and the game happens in the evening . 
  there is also a post-game sticky afterwards . 
  [ last game thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62zdkm/reuropes_eu4_campaign_part_6_coming_on_242017_at/ ) [ last post game thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/631heh/reuropes_eu4_thread_post_game_thread/ ), 
  yeah , usually we have somone who streams . 
   the mods are idiots can confirm . 
  this does n't even make sense . 
  your system is proven to be not that good in times of crisis . 
  at least as long as you are in a currency union . 
   he did more in favor of tax avoidance in luxembourg than any other person for a country built on such a system , that was kind of his job as pm . 
  what matters is what he does now and i see no reason to criticise him in this regard . 
   but obviously they dont pay the same social cotisation which still makes it unfair competition against french workers . 
  i do n't know if i correctly understand you here . 
  mind to elaborate ? 
   and its still a problem for jobs such as trucks drivers or construction workers . 
  i do n't know about france , but in germany all employers have significant troubles finding german truck drivers . 
  i have a hard time imagining that this is different in france . 
   and we will have a say when it comes to stay or not yeah , you will have a say on whether you stay in the euro or not , accurate . 
  but believing that you can change the fundamental rules of the euro zone is delusional . 
   we 're getting there , and we 'd be there already if french people werent so resilient . 
  recent labor laws , massive privatisations in the last decades ( which often are literally gifts , such as our highways ) , cut in healthcare , university reforms and the list goes on . 
  but the real show will be macron france is still miles behind most other european countries in this regard . 
  and i would actually call this a flaw . 
  the results do n't exactly speak for your system . 
   it is relevant since the eu basically institutionalized tax avoidance . 
  the eu under juncker has done more against tax avoidance than it did under his predecessors . 
   we do have a minimum wage . 
  but foreign worker are paid their native country wage actually this directive mandates the opposite of what you are claiming . 
  foreign workers are earning the minimum wage of france like any native french citizen . 
   france isnt greece . 
  if we dont have a word to say we have no reason to stay in . 
  you had a say - while drafting the rules in the first place . 
  and you agreed with them . 
  as i have outlined elsewhere , there is no middle ground on central bank independence . 
   if things keep going the neoliberal way , either you 'll see nationalists in power in the next decades ( le pen isnt popular for no reason ) and you 'll all be crying people are fascists . 
  france is miles away from a `` neoliberal way '' . 
   i 'd say most german media is just centrist in my experience aside perhaps heute show or opinion shows like this actually give off some sort of anti-extremes bias more than a left-wing bias . 
  satire is almost always left-wing . 
  pictures on newspapers are very rarely people torn in half . 
  usually it 's people who `` just '' have died . 
  the games ( usually ) happen every sunday 18-21 cet . 
  we use our regular discord for them , which you can find in the sidebar . 
  simply ask any mod to give you access to the eu4 channel . 
  you want to argue that the welt or the faz have a left-wing bias ?

   also , is n't it weird how dead syrian kids are totally fine to see in the news ? 
  but showing victims of domestic terror ( like sweden recently ) is ` distasteful ' ? 
  newspapers have always shown pictures of dead children from war areas . 
  be it syria , vietnam or iraq . 
  at least a part of turkey is in europe . 
  in fact , the population of turkey on the european continent exceeds the population of many european countries . 
  egypt on the other hand is n't even remotely european . 
  thanks for proving my point that the_dumbass posters are idiots . 
  take a map and look where egypt is . 
  hint : it is not in europe . 
   we didnt sign anything for `` your `` model . 
  actually you did . 
  all treaties concerning the `` model '' were signed in the 90s by your government , which had the power to do so .
