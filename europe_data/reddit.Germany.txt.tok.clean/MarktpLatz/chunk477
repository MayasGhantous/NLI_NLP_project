  you ( france ) forced germany to participate in the euro and we said yes , if these are the rules . 
  there is no point in arguing about that . 
  since there can not be a middle ground on central bank independence , take it or leave . 
   i just find it incredible that you and other people are fine holding france hostage like that . 
  nobody is held hostage , you are free to leave .

  his demands are non-negotiable for the rest of the eu , so he might just be honest and say that that he wants to leave it . 
   the lisbon treaty includes all previous treaties , it 's not a separate entity . 
  by voting against the lisbon treaty , france rejected all previous treaties and the rules that go with them , as is it 's democratic right . 
  wrong . 
  the referendum was n't about that . 
  the alternative to the treaty of lisbon was n't abandoning the eu/ez/all prior treaties . 
  the question was `` do you approve the bill authorising the ratification of the treaty establishing a constitution for europe ? 
  '' , nothing else . 
   of course it was legal , but we 're talking about the moral right for people to be upset about a situation and wanting to change it here . 
  when i say `` we never agreed '' , of course i 'm talking about french people , not about france as a legal state and it 's representatives . 
  that 's who matters after all . 
  this is simply irrelevant . 
  in a representative democracy , decisions of this kind are perfectly legitimate . 
  if you believe that this is unfair , change your own systems . 
  holy shit that 's ridiculous . 
   end the european central bank independence , modify its missions and statuses , authorize the repurchase of public debt directly from states , forbid the ecb to cut liquidity to a member state . 
  nothing of this kind is going to happen and for good reason . 
  nothing of this is acceptable for germany , austria , the netherlands , finland or the baltics . 
   without waiting , the bank of france will be put to the service of these objectives . 
  which would be a direct violation of the eu treaties . 
  the bank of france does not have these competences as long as france is part of the ez . 
   devaluate the euro to go back to parity with the dollar . 
  we are almost near parity anyways . 
  this wo n't `` fix '' anything . 
   settle finance 's hash , prohibit toxic financial instruments , tax financial transactions , control capital movement to prevent speculative attacks . 
  taxing financial transactions does n't make sense if there are major countries not participating . 
  have fun finding an unanimous desicion on this in the eu . 
   organize a european conference on sovereign debt leading to moratoriums , a reduction of interest rates , rescheduling and partial annulment . 
  what is this guy talking about ? 
  is he talking about greeces debt or about debt in general ? 
  if it is the latter , this does n't make * any * sense . 
   stop the liberalization of public services ( rails , energy , telecoms ... ) because states are so efficient in running these services ? 
  frances public sector is bloated already . 
   set up a solidary protectionism : stop the free circulation of capital and merchandises between the eu and third party countries , stop the free-trade policies that ruins the economy of developing countries and destructs the european industry , authorize state assistance for strategic sectors . 
  protectionism does n't help anyone . 
  especially not the average person . 
  it just drives prices up and it reduces the competitive pressure on the industries . 
   end dumping within the eu via a quick and strong-willed policy of upward social and fiscal harmonization throughout the eu , with a non-regression clause for social rights . 
  this guy does n't have a clue . 
  you can not simply lift romania on the level of france . 
  this is n't how any of this works . 
   refound the common agricultural policy to guaranty alimentary self-sufficiency , relocalization , and ecologic and non-industrial agriculture . 
  focusing entirely on non-industrial agriculture does n't make sense and any change to the cap faces significant opposition from the countries east of germany . 
   abandon the carbon market and pursue a genuine reduction of emissions of greenhouse gas policy with imperative convergence criteria . 
  without a good proposal for a replacement , this is nonsense . 
   does germany and other countries want to talk about various subjects such as the ecb independence or social and fiscal harmonization ? 
   thing is , france did n't agree with the rules . 
  see 2005 referendum . 
  you did . 
  the rules you/m \u00e9lenchon are complaining about were established way earlier . 
  the deficit rules were n't established in the treaty of lisbon . 
  the independence of the ecb was n't established in that treaty either . 
   and our politicians overruled the people 's will . 
  we never agreed with the rules in the first place and we have every right to be upset when the work against our interests . 
  that 's actually irrelevant . 
  what matters is that what happened was * legal * . 
  which it was . 
  it is not the french people themselves that negotiate , sign and ratify the treaties with the eu , it is the french government . 
  there is n't a law that prevented the french government from doing what it did . 
  you can be held accountable for what your government does . 
  you are free to argue that the french people are unhappy about the status quo , you can not argue that your country never agreed to what happened . 
  why do you think this `` private polling '' is more accurate ? 
   his bet is that the unilateral disobedience of france during negotiation will have positive results and convince other countries the changes are a good thing . 
  that 's a pretty bad bet . 
   anyway , if 27 countries can force 1 to abandon any idea of progress and happiness , because you need to follow the rules , think about the debt !!, 
  ! , something is wrong in the eu and leaving is the only sane option . 
  this is not about `` happiness and progress '' . 
  if you sign up for rules , you have to obey them . 
  if you do n't like them , feel free to leave , but it would likely be a disaster for both sides . 
  this is n't a relationship between two countries . 
  this is a club where everyone agreed on the rules and suddenly one guys decides he does n't like the rules anymore and complains that the other countries are n't willing to change the rules for one member .

  we are not accusing anybody anymore here . 
  the situation was handled poorly , but things have changed since then . 
  we however do not talk about ban reasons in public , generally speaking . 
  we are not going to publish ban reasons for a ban for an inactive account that happened over a year ago . 
  the user himself is free to ask for a ban appeal or the ban reasons .
