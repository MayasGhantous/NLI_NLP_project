  go a bit further down in the comment chain . 
  the reason why he was banned :  he personally attacked a mod , he also attacked several users , he insulted people who hold a different political opinion , he had records of shitposting and agenda pushing . 
  enough to justify a ban .

  read through the rules of the respective subreddits . 
  this subreddit is n't a place for advertising or surveys . 
  sorry , but this is n't the place . 
  how do you know ? 
  do you think i just made up what i wrote as reasons ? 
  it is still existent . 
  we have everything on record . 
  i gave a response now based on the user tags the mods then had available . 
  nothing has changed about the reasons since then . 
  again , the reasons were completely fine , just the communication was bad . 
  can not comment on the handling of his particular case as i was n't a mod back then . 
  i can only access the mod notes , and they tell me that his ban was justified . 
  what i outlined is the procedure in place today . 
   where 's the evidence he `` stalked and personally attacked '' a mod ? 
  if you do n't make such evidence public we might as well assume you say that to justify banning literally anyone . 
  we do not make stuff of this kind public , but we present the banned user with evidence if he asks for it . 
   specifically , which rule did he break , this should n't be a hard question to answer . 
  as i said above , he personally attacked a mod , he also attacked several users , he insulted people who hold a different political opinion , he had records of shitposting and agenda pushing . 
  enough to justify a ban . 
  you are citing a post that is way over a year old to come to ... whatever conclusion ? 
  the mods apologized in public because the ban was poorly handled , but from what i can see , it was completely justified . 
  the guy in question had a number of prior offences and he stalked and personally attacked one of our mods . 
  so yeah , no , this is n't a valid point you are making here . 
  the hell ? 
  how do you explain [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_culmdch3e0 ) then ? 
  uhm . 
  the croatian military has used them since 2015 . 
  i doubt that this is the first one . 
  it 's still manageable . 
  we are not # 1 on / r/all fortunately , otherwise shit would * really * hit the fan . 
  how do you know what we define as `` racism '' ? 
  removed - duplicate . 
   but they do not because of political reasons . 
  [ citation needed ], 
   you would n't have the possibility to sue before the eugh . 
  well , indirectly you do , because the bverfg tends to send questions of this kind to the ecj/eugh . 
   still , pretty shallow way to evade the fact that they did break rules , if you withdraw yourself to a posititon to say that there was n't a ruling against the ecb . 
  there were deliberate steps to inhibit the possiblity of such a ruling . 
  that was a confession in itself . 
  not really . 
  there are other parties who can sue in this regard . 
   that is beside the issue of the ecb very blatently breaking the rules . 
  it is a bit like pissing someone in the face and claiming that there is n't a ruling against that . 
  disagree . 
  i do n't really like what they are doing but i do n't think they are doing anything illegal/against the rules . 
  thank you !, 
   but why ? 
  this is a developing story and hardly anyone checks a reddit thread more than once , let alone checking the comments . 
  many people are actually . 
   if you 're going to make the thing a megathread at least sticky it . 
  i do n't know about you but this seems a little more important than `` theatres of europe '' which is currently stickied . 
  it 's already on top of the front page , does n't really make a difference . 
  you actually do ... somewhat . 
  you can sue in front of the bverfg which would cause them to make it illegal for the bundesbank to aid the ecb which would essentially kill such a program .

  we will/might see , will we ? 
  you have to consider three things : first of all , the people are n't here long enough to have a profound effect on the labour market at this point . 
  hence why i wrote about `` did n't '' - it might well happen in the future though . 
  most are still in integration/language courses and thus not available to the labour market , many of those who are available are unemployed as most employers would prefer a german employee .
