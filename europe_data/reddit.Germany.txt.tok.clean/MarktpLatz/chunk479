  secondly , we have a minimim wage in place . 
  and last but not least , there is a large amount of jobs open at the moment . 
  i think it is too early to jump to conclusions .

  even if they are , they are sufficiently equipped to maintain an engagement in syria . 
  we are not talking about a full-scale war here . 
  and i disagree about the collapse part . 
  there was no ruling saying that the ecb overstepped its mandate . 
  not even from the bverfg . 
  the bundesbank generally said that it disagrees , not that the actions are illegal . 
  economy-wise this might be true , but military-wise they are n't . 
   the simple fact that they are accountable to no one and can do whatever they want . 
  central bank independence does n't necessarily lead to corruption . 
  and you are wrong , they are accountable - the ecj can judge that they overstepped their mandate . 
   how many of them went to prison after 2008 crash ? 
  none , but they were n't the ones responsible for that crash either . 
  this wo n't happen in a vacuum . 
  russia wo n't sit idle while the west helps overthrowing assad . 
  not really , no . 
  government stimulus isnt that popular in germany . 
  if the money had n't been spent on refugees , we would have used it to pay off debts . 
  if you believe that infrastructure investments are good for `` people without skills '' , you live about fifty years in the past . 
  it is n't that way anymore . 
  plus we already are spending a lot on exactly that . 
  half our autobahns have roadworks at the moment . 
  additionally , most roads and bridges are a state matter . 
  there is already job training for the uneducated/poor available . 
  money is n't the issue in this regard . 
  the money spent `` on refugees '' already served as an internal stimulus . 
  there was no `` mandatory silence '' . 
  radical change as in ... ? 
  what exactly is `` corrupt '' about the central banks ? 
  the problem is that the inflation is too low , by the way . 
  mass migration did n't contribute to an increase in poverty for the native population in any meaningful way . 
  globalism is a shitty term that means nothing . 
  homelessness is a shitty indicator for poverty as the reasons for that are very diverse . 
   5.6 percent of the population is now officially classified as poor , while the number of millionaires in the country has risen to 16,495 - up from 12,424 in 2009 . 
  this says nothing about the current trend . 
  the poor people can benefit , even when the rich are benefitting more . 
  question : what was the development of the 5.6 % in the last few years and how is `` poor '' defined ? 
  i 'd like a source on that . 
  schulz has defended the agenda time and time again , the fact that he wants to modify some parts does n't change that . 
  removed . 
  we are not a campaign platform . 
  feel free to post a newspaper article about it , but we will not allow submissions that come directly from the candidates/their campaigns . 
  source on that ? 
  the report only talks about the comparison with 1995 . 
  this says very little about the current development . 
  you do realize that schulz has been part of the spd leadership longer than any other current spd politician ? 
  well , the article is three years old so ... 
  look at the date where the article was written ... removed . 
  they are . 
  we are still trying to find the best way of dealing with these trends . 
  that 's an operation that faces no opppsition however . 
  everyone agrees on fighting isil . 
  removed . 
  use / r/europemeta . 
  but you are wrong , we always had trends from time to time , they used to be the bread and butter of this sub before it became a default . 
   not intervening against russia-backed assad has been a recipe for disaster . 
  yes , but that 's nothing you can change at this point . 
  russia is too involved over there by now . 
   and it 's not pre-election `` strong talk . '', 
  macron was on hollande 's staff when he prepared with obama to strike syria in 2013 , when they did n't receive a un mandate either . 
  they did n't go . 
  and i see no signs of a change in international backing on this . 
  one reason why the us did n't want to go was the strength of syria 's air defence - which has only gotten stronger since then . 
   i gather that he wants to create a more business-friendly environment in france , but that may be difficult in a country that has historically been quite socialist . 
  well , he has ran on such a program , which makes a case for a mandate of this kind if he wins the election . 
  due to the unique setup of frances system however it is very possible that many people say `` i have not elected him to do that , i just wanted to prevent le pen '' . 
  i would however argue that he is in a better position to implement reforms of this kind than hollande was who ran on a program that pretty much promised the opposite . 
  we will have to see i guess . 
   my main worry is that if he fails to address the causes of populism , le pen will only come back stronger . 
  this is all about prosperity in my opinion . 
  if he can `` fix '' the problems france has ( large deficite , high unemployment , many regions facing problems , decreasing influence on the european stage ) , he will be effective in combatting populism , if he does n't , there is a chance for le pen . 
  but i would argue that the recipes of his competitors do not have a better chance of achieving that either .

  pre-election strong talk . 
  we all know that there will not be an un mandate due to russias veto in the unsc and an intervention against russia-backed assad is a recipe for disaster . 
  this is n't that easy . 
  we only have two sticky slots and they are almost always occupied . 
  making space for megathreads is n't easy , especially when there are more important things ( elections , our weekly threads ) or when there are multiple trends at once .

  i would guess that americans that tend to be more conservative do n't care about europe that much and thus do not frequent / r/europe . 
  we see an influx of more critical american voices when posts reach / r/all . 
  we never tried that though .
