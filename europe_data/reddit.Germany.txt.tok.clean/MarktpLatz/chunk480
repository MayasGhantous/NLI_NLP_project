  relocation was always from greece and italy , not from germany . 
  it 's the law . 
  does n't matter . 
  they can only get their own underage children ( no adults ) or their parents if they are below 18 years old . 
  they have no chance to bring the larger family .

  well , that was a joint effort by your politicians and media combined with outstanding ignorance from your educated elite . 
  most of what happened in the years after you joined was actually enshrined in the treaties that were already existing before you joined . 
  actual madman modman reporting  you have earned it . 
  at least for a few days .

  i think the point auckland345 was making was that the ecj could * potentially * be used for that purpose . 
  the jurisdiction is a bit of a weak argument right now because the hypothetical arbitration court which could be set up in the future does n't have jurisdiction either yet . 
  i would consider this to be rather unlikely however . 
  it would be a huge red flag for your country and it would also kind of defeat the purpose of isds . 
  isds is n't an institution , it is the basic system . 
  it is open how the mechanism will work in ceta , we do not really know much about ics yet . 
  but it is very likely that the trade agreement with the uk will involve some kind of fixed court , not independent arbitration panels under the roof of institutions ( e.g. 
  the world bank ) like in the past .

  if you do not trust my judgement , feel free to write a mod mail to get an answer from my fellow mods . 
  this submission has shitty quality . 
  it is essentially a blog .

  i accidently cut off an `` s '' on the end of that link . 
  fixed now . 
  we have compiled [ this list ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/news_sources ) a while back . 
  removed . 
  i get a 404 error for that page . 
  it 's pretty close . 
  [ support for the death penalty dropped below 50 % for the first time in 2015 ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32061822 ) . 
  it essentially just needs a single incident ( major case of child molestation or something similar ) to get that above 50 % again . 
  while the poll is only about leave voters , the general opinion in the uk is n't that far off . 
  edit : guys , please look at the source i linked below before you downvote . 
  what i wrote is supported by facts .

  also approved it now . 
  i think it 's worth mentioning that the value of aramco is completely uncertain at the moment . 
  the mentioned two trillion dollars is a number floated by the saudis themselves , and it is based on a relatively simple calculation that is based on the size of saudi arabias oil reserves . 
  many financial experts estimate that the value might well just be half what the saudis think and there have even been estimations by some consulting firms putting the value at 400 bn usd . 
  sorry mate , typo . 
  fixed that now .
