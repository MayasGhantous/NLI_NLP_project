  thanks for the notification . 
  i really do not see how this could aid his cause however . 
  it just paints the uk ( tabloid ) press in a bad light . 
  accurate . 
  the sun is aready banned on this subreddit - in fact all tabloids are . 
  the sun is n't banned for the opinions it represents . 
  it is covered by the general ban on tabloids on this sub - which is enforced regardless of what political leaning the tabloid in question has .

   the rules say `` clarify '' , you and the op think it 's important to `` clarify '' that potential muslims did it . 
  i disagree , but it 's just my opinion . 
  i personally do not think that it is `` important '' that this is in the title . 
  i simply think that it it does n't warrant a removal . 
  please stop assuming what my `` intentions '' are or what i think . 
  seriously , all i did here was apply the rules accordingly . 
  you are debating a non-issue . 
   yet , this type of `` clarification '' helped invite 200 comments of how muslims are homophobic , racist , and the very relevant part of muslims having killed people in india , and being `` explosive '' ( as the title subtly references ) . 
  the same could very much have happened without it being included in the title . 
  i mean - it is right there , directly below the headline . 
  it 's not like op made this up . 
   now , if anti-islamic speech is part of `` a serious issue that we are facing in some parts of germany and it is definitely worth discussing '' how do feel this post helped , exactly ? 
  by creating a platform where people can freely express their bigotry ? 
  we can not control * what * people write . 
  all we can do is tremove rule-breaking comments and participate in the discussion ourselves . 
   i have a vague memory of the rules explaining hate crime . 
  goes something like `` muslims are racist '' is different from `` some muslims are racist '' . 
  can i go through the comments now and report these , or is that a waste of time ? 
  feel free to report these things , we will look at it . 
   so if i posted legitimate articles all the time about how migrants are negative for swedish society i would n't get a warning for agenda pushing ? 
  it depends on the account in general i would say . 
  if the account only ever posts about one singular topic , it could qualify as agenda pushing . 
  if the account posts about a wide variety of issues , the situation is different .
