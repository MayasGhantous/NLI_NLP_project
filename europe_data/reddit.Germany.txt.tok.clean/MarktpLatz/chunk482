  this is completely inaccurate . 
  he was n't mandated by the sub rules to do this , but what he did was * allowed * by those rules . 
   did you report it ? 
  i tried , but a german mod thought that we had to clarify that a german did n't do the bullying . 
  this allegation is ridiculous to say the least . 
  i did not choose the title and i did not ask op to put the title that way . 
  all i did was saying that including the sub-headline in the title is n't prohibited by the rules . 
  any other mod will confirm that to you . 
  i can guarantee you that this has nothing to do with my nationality or my personal beliefs . 
   now the thread is infested with anti-muslim comments , nobody cares about the bullied kid anymore . 
  you have to differenciate . 
  we removed quite a few rule-breaking comments now , but criticising islam for this is n't forbidden or remote - antisemitism is still much more prevalent amongst followers of that religion unfortunately . 
  i also think that it is not surprising that the focus is n't the child - it was never supposed to be that way . 
  german articles about it also focussed on the problems with antisemitism of people with foreign descent . 
  this is a serious issue that we are facing in some parts of germany and it is definitely worth discussing . 
  posting a legit article does n't qualify as agenda pushing .

  i do not really know what you are on about . 
  generally , we prefer it if people simply use the headline , this would have been sufficient in this context . 
  however , this addition here is n't that severe and we will thus leave it standing . 
  whether this is newsworthy in the first place or whether the attention is justified - well that 's not really up to us , is it ? 
  it 's explicitly stated in the rules :  editorialised titles : use the original title of the article , or add text from the byline or the first paragraph where necessary ( for clarity ) . 
  refrain from including your opinion within the title or arbitrarily emphasizing selective segments .

   the story of a 14-year-old who had to change schools to escape anti-semitism is making headlines in germany . 
  the boys ' tormentors were of arab and turkish descent - making the news even more explosive . 
  this is literally directly below the headline . 
  he simply included the secondary headline . 
  it 's fine . 
  is it 500 million just for the design ? 
  wait what ? 
  half a billion quid for a * new passport design * ? 
  am i missing something here ?

  i am not talking about combat ships , i am talking about the ships necessary to maintain a prolonged deployment . 
  you have exactly one major supply ship in service , the stromboli class ships were supposed to be decomissioned almost ten years ago due to their age and wear . 
  ( sidenote : you got ta love that italy puts a biggish gun on every ship , no matter whether it is a support vessel or not ), 
  fixed . 
  the uk should definitely not be behind italy . 
  i suspect italy ranks this highly because they have aircraft carries despite them not having the fleet to support them in actual combat . 
  stop being ridiculous , uk ( press/military/politicians ) . 
  nobody is suggesting going to war . 
  not over gibraltar , not over anything else . 
  some people seem to be very eager to treat european nations as military adversaries while we simply are n't . 
  if anything happens to gibraltar , it will be political . 
  well ... that was a lot of nonsense .

  [ it shows ] ( http://www.fpa.org.uk/news/uk-has-highest-teenage-birth-rates-western-europe ), 
   genuinely curious : what uninformed decision switzerland has taken through a referendum that stands out ? 
  two that come to mind right now : the swiss population has rejected the purchase of gripen jets to replace their decades old f-5 tiger ii jets , a model that was decomissioned over a decade ago in other european nations . 
  with the lifespan of these planes coming to an end , switzerland might have to decomission these fighters without having a replacement ready in the next few years ( iirc 2018 ) . 
  additionally , the referendum to curb eu migration to switzerland as the full implementation of that deal would do significant damage to the swiss economic and diplomatic relations with the eu . 
  people mainly focussed on the immigration and ignored the implications that this decision would have on the relationship with the eu . 
  to the eu , access to the free market is not possible without the freedom of movement and as a result , the initially proposed limits on eu migration were removed from the legislation in the end of 2016 :  on 22 december 2016 , switzerland and the eu concluded an agreement that a new swiss law ( in response to the referendum ) may require swiss employers to give priority to swiss-based job seekers ( swiss nationals and foreigners registered in swiss job agencies ) but does not limit the free movement of eu workers to switzerland .
