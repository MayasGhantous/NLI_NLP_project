  thanks for doing this , mate !, 
  [ old thread about french election ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/609p0e/all_you_need_to_know_about_the_upcoming_french/ ) . 
  -- -- -- if other people want to do threads of this kind for further elections , we would appreciate it if you shoot us a mod mail in advance so that we do not get multiple threads about the elections . 
  yeah , we have enacted that policy 30 minutes ago . 
   i know , and i 'm okay with that . 
  it has the potential to be very damaging . 
  see for example the current problems between switzerland and the eu following their referendum a few years ago . 
   it acts as an incentive for people to at least try to stay informed i think switzerland is a very good example of how to run decent referendums . 
  [ reddit post for reference ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5luu94/how_voting_works_in_switzerland/ ) . 
  this does n't change the fact that i do n't really like referendums . 
   and it 's also a reason for everyone to support higher education standards we should support higher education standards no matter what , direct democracy or not . 
   obviously it 's not perfect , but i think it 's a far superior system to completely giving up on active citizenship . 
  i disagree . 
  i am a firm believer in representative democracy . 
  both systems have advantages and disadvantages , i would not say that either of them is necessarily superior . 
  generally speaking , referendums are a very good tool on a smaller level , but it has the tendency to become problematic on a large scale imo .

  what are you seeing that i am not seeing here ? 
  the hdp and the akp have roughly similar results . 
  even switzerland takes uninformed decisions at times and their participation rate is pathetic in most cases . 
  please link a source . 
  it 's # 1 on the front page anyways . 
  no need . 
   i posted it onto the / r/europe subreddit telling them its a script for the eu flag , seems to be working well . . well , not anymore , 
  i think there seems to be a significant misunderstanding here . 
  i do not oppose germany spending more for its military and i believe that we need to spend more and do more . 
  i am not fully convinced by the 2 % target ( as is an artificial target that says very little of the actual capabilities of an army ) and i reject the us setting deadlines of this kind . 
  not more and not less . 
   congress keeps buying tanks because congress wont approve the abrams replacement the army wants , so they buy tanks to keep the current production line open . 
  does n't make it any less unnecessary or expensive . 
   also there were originally 32 zumwalts planned , 29 have been cancelled . 
  the navy wanted to cancel 31 of them but congress was blackmailed into buying two more . 
  at around 4 bn . 
  unit cost excluding r&d , this is quite a lot of money for a bad ship . 
   are you going to argue the status quo would remain the same in europe if the us returned to our non-alignement stance we had in the early days of ww1 and ww2 ? 
  never argued that . 
   the status quo of numerous conflicts goes out the window from europe vs russia , saudi arabia vs iran , india vs pakistan , china vs japan , south korea vs north korea , colombia vs venezuela , ect . 
  we are expected to be engaged in some level in all these conflicts yet europe cant get 2 % of its gdp to its own defense ? 
  that 's not the point . 
  i simply said that you could fulfill all these `` tasks '' with a lower budget if you managed it properly . 
  this is n't saying that we do n't have similar problems in germany . 
   germany cant even get parts for its planes to fly well , that 's a bit misleading . 
  yes , we had problems with spares due to a terrible policy decision by one of our previous ministers of defence but these problems are fixed now . 
  most of the planes that were listed `` not fit for service '' simply lacked the newest software update . 
   germany having to buy cheap and unreliable rifles this was later proven to be a false allegation . 
  there were no complaints whatsoever about the rifle from soldiers that had actually used the rifle in combat . 
  the tests where the g36 failed were scenarios that particular rifle was never meant for . 
  other countries have tested the rifle and found it to be perfectly fine . 
  it was mainly a political issue . 
   bringing in brooms to war games to act as machine guns they dont have people will never get tired of making this completely inaccurate claim , will they ? 
  the vehicle in question was a command vehicle and it was n't supposed to be armed . 
  the guarding vehicles for that command vehicle * were * armed . 
   you want to bitch about us buying destroyers ? 
  i simply listed it as one of the reasons why the us overspends on military - and it is seen as a fair point of criticism even by american military experts . 
   germany is the richest , most populaous country in europe claiming the eu is the future and it wont do shit when russia takes half its backyard ? 
  ukraine is neither part of eu nor of nato and the issue has a bit more facets than that . 
  it certainly was n't our equipment or military spending that was the problem in this regard . 
  it 's a reddit page ( / r/place ) where everyone can change one pixel every ten minutes .

  you said `` fund '' , which by definition is exactly this : spending money . 
   it 's great that interests align , but what do you bring to the table aside from moral support ? 
  apart from the fact that we give land to the us for these purposes ( which they need for their bases ) and intelligence cooperation : germany was the third biggest contributor of troops to the war in afghanistan after the us and the uk . 
  germany is contributing troops for the nato batallions that were recently set up in the baltics and it is currently policing the air space of the baltics for nato . 
  germany has also participated in operation atlanta with several ships over several years . 
  yes , there are countries are doing more , but it 's not like we are doing nothing whatsoever . 
  it 's not like we are n't funding our army . 
  germany is still in the top 10 worldwide in terms of military spending . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsvxeznijpi ), 
  again - the target changes nothing about the current 2024 goal , which was agreed upon rather recently . 
  this was the target in general . 
  recently , the countries have committed to increase their spending towards 2 % until 2024 . 
  nope . 
  that 's the decision of your military or your president to be more precise . 
   what is the us military doing in germany to protect me in the middle of the us ? 
  germany is serving as a strategic hub for the air force , you carry out your drone strikes in the middle east via germany ( due to the curvage of the earth ) and you have significant intel operations for the middle east ( and partly europe ) from here . 
  germany has n't chosen to abandon nato ... 
  yeah . 
  to add to that - the eastern countries would take 1.2 % germany being in nato over no germany . 
  i was n't complaining , i simply answered to something . 
  i have no problems with your guys being here . 
  yeah , it is a sales tax . 
  not exactly know how this works . 
  either they can request it back once they leave the country or they do not pay it in the first place . 
  why should we want that ? 
  `` these things '' are done to protect your country and your allies .
