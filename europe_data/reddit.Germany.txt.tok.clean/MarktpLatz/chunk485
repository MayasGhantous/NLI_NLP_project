  i would argue that this is simply caused by the mandate of the ecb . 
  as we all know , the ecb is modelled after the bundesbank , which effectively causes its policies to be familiar and fitting to us while countries that are used to a different style of central banking ( connected with political shortcomings due to this ) might feel that it does n't match them as well . 
  but in the end , it is what everyone agreed on when entering the ez . 
   the 2009-2014 period actually saw a eurozone soveriegn risk spread because of that . 
  we neither have debt sharing nor eurobonds , having a spread between solvent members and less solvenmt members is not only correct , it is in fact desirable as it pushes the governments to do reforms . 
  yeah . 
  i think the new legislation goes in the right direction , but nothing is set in stone in this regard . 
  that 's ignoring the ecbs mandate however . 
  it is not the job of the ecb to ensure economic well-being through central bank spending or to aid decreasing unemployment . 
  their goal is price stability . 
  if these goals are n't met in the rest of europe - fair enough . 
  but this does n't speak against a reduction of these programmes and they should not refuse to act once they reach their target . 
  inflation is above 2 % in belgium and at 1.1 % in france . 
  even greece is at 1.3 % again . 
  1.5-1 .6 % is a very healthy level . 
   why would the german people pay so that foreigners can use their roads , if those same foreigners charge toll on their roads ? 
  the effect of this would be that we would not pay anything while foreigners would . 
  apart from that : foreigners already pay fuel taxes in germany , this should be way more money than the money they plan to get from the toll . 
   i think we should move to a system now where charge all drivers for every kilometer they drive on any particular road , then that money goes to the country or private business that built that owns that road . 
  i hate systems of this kind . 
  it puts people who have to drive a lot for job reasons ( or who have family somewhere else ) at a disadvantage . 
  i would prefer a europe-wide fixed toll that every car owner pays where the money is then distributed based on how much the roads are used . 
  the surplusses are not `` illegal '' . 
   definitely , deutsche bank was also a big ( german ) player in derivatives before the crisis . 
  they still are the second biggest player in this regard , having almost 50 trillion usd in derivates in their books . 
  how much is such a license in the uk ? 
  yup . 
  this was part of one of the many compromises . 
  thanks !, 
  this is one of the few cases where i really wish that germany loses in front of the ecj . 
  this whole thing is ridiculous . 
   the cuts in our social system during the 2000 were an order of magnitude bigger than whatever greece/spain/italy has done in the last 6 years . 
  are you talking relative or total reduction ? 
  and source ? 
  unemployment is decreasing in * every single * eu country ( only exception is cyprus which recently saw a minor increase , but the general trend is still there ) . 
  ns2 is a project by companies from all over europe . 
  it is n't just a german-russian project . 
  i expect to see further changes in this regard as the technology advances . 
  it is not reasonable to expect this to be the legal status forever . 
  additionally , we also see these `` semi-autonomous '' trucks being tested - with one manned truck leading and several self-driving trucks following the first one . 
   how much is a hgv licence to drive a truck in germany ? 
  around 2,000 $ . 
  many companies decide to cover that cost however if required . 
  mirror ? 
  please do not post outdated and wrong news . 
  barnier himself later said that the negotiation language is n't set to french . 
  i honestly do not think that there was a fight between us . 
  simply dissenting opinions .

  sorry , but this is n't the place for questions of this kind . 
  i do not think that there is such a sub - this one might actually be the one that is the closest to this . 
  we have featured most other relevant subreddits in this regard on the sidebar . 
  additionally , you could try / r/politicaldiscussion , which is mainly us-centric but occasionally also has eu topics .

  voter turnout has to do with a lot of things , you can not simply draw this connection . 
  in many democracies , the voter turnout decreases over time . 
  you also have examples of countries like switzerland , where the turnout ( both in elections and referendums ) tends to be below 50 % . 
  no worries ,

  germany did n't initiate shit . 
  the refugees were coming here long before germany said a public word on this . 
  i have no idea what you are trying to tell me . 
  germany has a lot more in common with the u.k. than with southern europe in some areas . 
  this is impossible within two years however . 
  no worries , i had already removed them . 
  i know that pain . 
  wrong sub . 
  use / r/askeurope 2 . 
  the limit is 370,000 3 . 
  the limit is n't irreversible . 
  a joint eu army would include france , which would essentially make this a non-issue .

  nothing taken out of context , it is literally the start of that interview - which was linked in full in this thread by the way . 
  his allegation is objectively ridiculous .
