  sorry , the money from soros was just too tempting . 
   like i said , i do n't agree with him on this and other things , but i have a lot of respect for him . 
  thank you !, 
   i am also not a great debater and he still buried himself into a hole with an argument that sounds like `` telegraph is ok , we do n't care about ipso , we know better and just ban stuff we do n't like '' . 
  i could have worded it a bit better , agreed . 
  it was in no way intended to contain this message . 
  as live_free has outlined , there is a variety of factors on which we base our judgement of sources . 
   downvoting and then bitching about articles like this are the only outlet we have . 
  i agree with keeping meta discussions to meta , but the quantity of articles like this is continuously increasing . 
  i am sure you guys know this better than me . 
  a mod jumping in to stand by a constantly poor quality source makes it sound we are now stuck with this panorama . 
  while looking like we ca n't even complain about it . 
  well , i went into this discussion to explain why we do not ban the telegraph , not to kill off the discussion about it . 
  i mean , a good part of the complaints in this regard ar justified , but the initial poster called for a complete ban . 
   people act like deleting a post is taking it out from `` the internet '' . 
  it 's not censorship , anyone can subscribe to the telegraph or even the telegraph sub on reddit . 
  it 's keeping an editorial and quality threshold/balance that makes commenting and exchanging ideas on a post a very different experience from most of the news agencies own websites . 
  i disagree . 
  people do not bother to subscribe to the telegraph itself or the telegraph sub ( is there even such a sub ? ), 
  people come here to debate a variety of issues , presented by a variety of sources . 
  and these users can expect us to allow sources from both sides of the polticial spectrum . 
  if i am not mistaken , the most frequently posted uk sources are the guardian , the telegraph and the bbc . 
  taking the telegraph out of it would make this fairly one-sided . 
   we can have have fun pics , if they get out of hand , they get culled . 
  great policy . 
  we should have the same for shitty news articles . 
  `` we reached our quota of end of the world articles for the day . 
  try again tomorrow . . 
  if the world still exists . '', 
  considering actual news , that 's a pretty vague rule , do n't you think ? 
  when we stop the `` fun trends '' , nobody complains because it is usually at the point where everyone is already annoyed by them . 
  if we did the same with actual news or opinion pieces , people would accuse us of `` censoring dissenting opinions '' . 
  and i could somewhat understand them in this regard . 
  as live_free already said , there is always the report button for duplicates and we will not decide what the users have to upvote or not . 
  nope . 
  this post has no value whatsoever for this sub . 
  it does n't add to any discussion , it is n't very interesting to look at , it was downvoted and heavily reported .

  the fuck ? 
  the ban for the daily mail does not originate from the number of ipso complaints . 
  there 's more to that . 
  and no , i do not consider nine successful complaints over two years sufficient evidence . 
  we are talking about nine ( ! ), 
  complaints that were upheld over the course of two years . 
  many of which not even affecting major topics . 
  the times came second with seven upheld breaches by the way . 
  this does n't discredit the telegraph as a source . 
  the quality of the telegraph in general is fine . 
  it 's just the opinion pieces that tend to be stupid at times . 
  but hey - the same can be said about the guardian . 
  the nrw cdu is n't really that appealing . 
  realpolitik is what we do , it literally is a german word . 
  well , it 's realpolitik . 
  we in fact have on state that is governed by the linke and they are doing just fine . 
  the problem is that its members in western germany tend to be fundamentalists , as opposed to the pragmatists in the east . 
  they still are a respected newspaper and they wo n't get banned . 
  it is alright to have newspapers representing both sides of the political spectrum . 
  we do n't plan to turn the sub into a giant criclejerk . 
  they would actually have the votes required - spd+g reens + linke ( all in favour of same-sex marriage ) have have a potential majority in the parliament . 
  unlikely . 
  the other newspapers ( spiegel , zeit ) were still owned by their founders at that time . 
  the hell ? 
  alright , will reinstate .
