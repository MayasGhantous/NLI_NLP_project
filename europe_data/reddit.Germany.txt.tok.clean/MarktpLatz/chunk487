  there is n't a single recent poll for nrw that shows the cdu anywhere close to the spd . 
  the only thing that might become problematic is a continuation of the red-green government , but this is mainly due to the weakness of the greens . 
  i do n't really have anything on the * current * ( post-schulz-becoming-spd-candidate ) voters , but have a look at this : [ federal election 2013 ] ( https://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2013-09-22-bt-de/analyse-wanderung.shtml ) [ berlin election 2016 ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-09/waehlerwanderung-berlin-wahl-afd-cdu-abgeordnetenhaus ) [ mecklenburg-vorpommern 2016 ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-09/mecklenburg-vorpommern-landtagswahl-waehlerwanderung-afd ) relevant translations : gr\u00fcne = greens andere parteien = other parties npd = our nazi party zugezogene = moved into the state since the last election erstw\u00e4hler = first time voters nichtw\u00e4hler = people who did not vote verstorbene = deceased fortgezogene = left the state since the last election, 
  the afd or the current spd ? 
  look at the voter movements in recent times . 
  there is evidence that these many of these people are moving to the spd .

  this would n't surprise me . 
  does n't change the fact that the cdu outperformed the polls . 
  the most recent federal election poll ( 07.03.17 ) has the saarland at 44 % spd 32 % cdu by the way . 
  most german newspapers are n't owned by companies or individuals . 
  many are owned by independent foundations or majority owned by their own employees . 
  the notable exception are the newspapers belonging to axel-springer ( bild , welt ) . 
   red red green however would include `` die linke '' , which wants to leave nato and orientate towards russia while i dislike the idea of the linke becoming part of the government , let 's be fair with them : they have recently said that they would not make this a condition for entering a coalition . 
  it 's not far-right voters . 
  it 's the disenfranchised voters . 
  people who are upset about the state of affairs . 
  in the past , these people and protest voters used to vote for the * linke * , but they moved to the afd in recent years . 
  as the afd becomes more and more right-wing , these people are looking for another party . 
  and since the spd under schulz serves as a projection screen for the many hopes and desires of the people and since schulz is liked by many people since people think he has n't anything to do with the policy of the spd in the last two decades ( which is nonsense , but whatever ) , people vote spd again . 
  additionally , you have some voters that used to vote cdu or spd but were upset about the refugee crisis . 
  since this has essentially become a non-topic here , much to the despair of the afd , people are returning to their `` original '' parties . 
  i think it is just what you are used to . 
  to anyone without a treshold , it could seem high , agreed . 
  oh , i totally agree with you . 
  we will have two elections very soon where the spd is set to win ( sh+nrw ) . 
  this does n't change the fact that i believe that the spd is a bit over-hyped in general . 
  schulz wo n't rule out rrg , which will hurt him/them . 
   does it really make sense having a threshold at the local level ( at least such an high one ) ? 
  5 % is not exactly high in my opinion . 
  not having it would create fragile multi-party coalitions involving four or more parties . 
   small states , grand coalitions will be pretty much inevitably and even in larger ones , it 's kind of a risk . 
  not really . 
  funfact : the co-chief of the afd ( gauland ) declared * on television * that the afd is a populist party . 
   and could be deported lagally if german governments thinks so . 
  that 's inaccurate . 
  due to an early treaty between turkey and the ec , it is nearly impossible to deport turkish people if they have worked here for a certain amount of time .

  it confirmed what i expected . 
  i assumed that the spd is a little over-hyped at the expense of the cdu . 
  i think the same is the case on the federal level . 
  mainly the spd i would argue . 
  all polls in the saarland predicted that the afd would reach 6-7 % , their result was 6.2 % . 
  well , it 's not impossible . 
  half a year ago , they were at 12.5 % and it is still half a year to go until the election .

  if you post an article that gets removed , you can still find that article through your profile and link it . 
  same story if you commented on a thread that got removed . 
  that 's pretty much an unfounded claim . 
  but hey , let me see it when you find one . 
  well , present evidence that we do n't . 
  you wo n't find a single post that has been deleted because it is pro-uk . 
  we do not remove based on what we like or do not like . 
  we take our decisions based on the rules . 
  removed . 
  repost with proper title . 
  source ? 
  this all looks a bit artificial .
