  i was referring to the cities that are now polish . 
  you are correct of course . 
  fair point , but this does n't change much in the regard that germanys wages were nowhere near low enough to compare them to china today . 
  yup . 
  78.5 % of the seats . 
  that is n't * entirely * accurate . 
  [ look at the comparison on page 6 ( 416 ) ] ( http://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/reference%20media/allen_2001_history%20of%20inequality.pdf ) . 
  at the time when these labels were introduced ( late 19th century ) , germany was n't amongst the cheapest regions in europe by a big margin . 
  italy and poland for example had much cheaper workforce at that time . 
  they still were cheaper than the uk though .

  the british invented that . 
  they marked german goods as `` made in germany '' starting in the end of the 19th century to `` protect the british consumer from low-quality products '' .

  like a sum-up of what has been agreed upon which can serve as a basis for a discussion .

  we had the post about france stickied for half a week now and we will likely put it back up prior to the election which is still over four weeks from now .

  nothing ? 
  we are not an eu sub , we are a sub for the whole of europe . 
  nobody believes that anymore . 
  it was scary the first three times it was threatened . 
  but this is like the 20th time ? 
  i have stopped counting . 
  accurate . 
  every recognized country has/can have a flair here . 
  on top of that , the countries that are completely in europe got the first level administration flags . 
  that makes sense . 
  thank you !, 
  apparently this is a hoax/scam guys . 
  according to these guys : [ 1 ] ( https://twitter.com/georg_renner/status/845242912984219648 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://twitter.com/schattleitner/status/845241835803082752 ) ( in german ) the site is n't even a month old , most of the followers appear to be bought , the uid leads to a marketing agency and the owner of the webpage owns 34 other dubious pages . 
  it appears to be a scam . 
  not really . 
  germany is europes biggest beer-producing nation by a wide margin . 
  it 's the same with wine in italy or france . 
  denmark and sweden on the other hand are not exactly known as wine-producing nations . 
  in fact , sweden produced a whole 5000 l of wine in 2006 . 
  to anyone from denmark or sweden : is there a particular reason why you are so big on wine ? 
  fair enough ,

  source ( s ) ? 
  not necessarily . 
  polandball never claimed to be factually accurate - quite the opposite actually . 
  it is fair to use stereotypes even if you know that they are wrong . 
  thank you for this post !, 
  stickied !, 
  could also be your tax returns .
