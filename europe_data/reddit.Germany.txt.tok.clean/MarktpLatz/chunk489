  sorry , but this is n't the appropriate place . 
  try / r/askeurope , / r/germany or / r/travel . 
  tabloids are generally banned on this sub . 
   diversity of views/news is generally not tolerated on / r/europe sorry , but that 's bullshit . 
  we would have no problems allowing rt if they were less shitty . 
  this is n't the right place . 
  / r/europemeta is . 
  but to answer your question : it is a source that frequently puts out shitty articles , from clickbait to completely inaccurate or misleading . 
  rt has frequently misrepresented topics to push a certain agenda and since we can not check every single submission for the whole content and fact-check it , we completely banned it .

  that 's the only poll where this is the case , and it is generally the poll that is the least favorable to the cdu .

  it is n't * that * relevant to be honest . 
  we included the relevant info in the flair . 
  it was the original title at the time it was posted . 
  we unfortunately do not have the power to change the title of a submission . 
  it 's covered by art . 
  43 as you can not restore public order without a stable currency . 
  i am not saying that . 
  the other articles of the hague conventio mandate to essentially `` keep the country running '' , for which this monetary transfer was essential . 
  does n't matter . 
  this is n't ... how this works . 
  you can only have legitimate claims under arbitration if there is an agreement for arbitration . 
  we are trying to find appropriate responses . 
  not every shitpost deserves a ban , but some certainly do . 
   huh ?!, 
  you are saying german courts have no jurisdiction over loans the german government took ? 
  who would you sue if the government failed to pay their bonds in germany ? 
  this did not happen in germany , it happened in greece . 
  as for the bonds - it always depends on the jurisdiction of those bonds . 
   lol , my government is not the greek government . 
  but i think it shows the nazi mentality is still strong in you , if fear is the way you operate . 
  i apologize if i wrongly assumed that you are greek . 
   but i think it shows the nazi mentality is still strong in you , if fear is the way you operate . 
  nothing to do with mentality . 
  it was merely a factual assessment of the reality - and you will have to admit that this * is * the reality . 
  if it were down to me - let them sue . 
  i am 100 % confident in our position , at least we could close this chapter finally . 
  it is quite annoying to have countries come back every ten years and talk about some alleged reparations we still owe them . 
   i do n't believe that 's true , since the occupation force is responsible for maintaining public services . 
  for example america was being attacked for it 's failure in iraq with regards to electricity and running water . 
  this is part of the hague convention as well . 
   where did the food and money go to ? 
  the money was used to stabilize the drachma , which collapsed under the occupation . 
   you are saying you believe that under the hague convention the occupied nation should pay for the troops salary and food ?!, 
  exactly this is possible . 
  art . 
  49 of the hague convention . 
   huh , signing a document saying you will pay me 5 euro , does n't oblige you to pay me 5 euro ? 
  the debt was never waived , nor were they reparations . 
  so what are you rambling about . 
  there are good arguments to be made that the loan was used to cover the occupation cost which would mean that they would have to be repayed as reparations , if anything .
