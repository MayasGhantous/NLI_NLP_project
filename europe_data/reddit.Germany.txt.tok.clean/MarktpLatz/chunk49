  well , there is nobody to blame for it but iran though . 
  depending on the person researching , there have been multiple people that have said it could be up to two millions . 
  it is true that we will never know , neither you nor i can determine what is the accurate number i guess . 
  we can be certain that it was well into the hundred thousands however . 
  i edited my original post to point out that uncertainty . 
   there were rapes , as during all wars , but not on this scale any confirmation for this claim ? 
  so you are basing your assumption that i am wrong on some weird `` axis history forum '' ? 
  and in the end , it does not really matter if it were `` just '' hundred thousands of rapes or over a million . 
  unfortunately the homes for elders are staffed and payed really bad . 
  a shame , the workload these people to is immense . 
  however , they are not even willing to improve it when there are * no * alternatives , it simply results in the sector being understaffed and people having to wait for an hour if they ring their bell . 
  i believe that the numbers in that document i linked ( which was outdated at a second look by the way , from 2011 , [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_414_en.pdf ) is the current version , fixed telephone access in germany increased even more to 91 % ) are considering actually connected telephones . 
  the numbers actually come from a representative survey , according to the source . 
   all the carriers in the u.s. offer unlimited calling on cell phones now so it is simply not practical to have land lines . 
  how so ? 
  its pretty much the same here , as i said ? 
  smartphones/cellphones alone can not serve as an argument why you should not have a land line , look at sweden with 98 % , i doubt that they have no cellphones . 
  flat rate is synonymous with unlimited calling/texting here btw . 
  well , smartphones are prevalent and the prices are ... well - they are okay , you usually get your flatrate ( unlimited usage ) for calling and sms rather cheap , however the amount of data you get is laughable compared to other eu countries ( i 'd say the average person has between one and three gigs a month ) . 
  people simply like having a land line because it is pretty convenient , you can have the luxury of not being available with it . 
  it also has somewhat better sound quality . 
  i actually dont really ` mind ' the looting . 
  its what almost every nation did at some point in war , its what the german soldiers did in russia and all the other countries we invaded . 
  fun fact : [ you probably know this picture ] ( https://yourenotspecialbecause.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/red_army_soldiers_raising_the_soviet_flag_on_the_roof_of_the_reichstag_berlin_germany.jpeg ) - this was actually a very early retouch job , in the original version , the right soldier was [ wearing a second , looted watch ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lnwxrr_fiie/us08ko7r77i/aaaaaaaaima/8xtavryw0hk/s1600/soldiers+raising+the+soviet+flag+over+the+reichstag,+berlin+1945.jpg ) i dont have a problem with people writing `` to berlin '' on their cars , whatever . 
  what i find less funny is [ this ] ( http://flot.com/upload/resize_cache/medialibrary/fb8/800_450_1d65cf8a9d606d53c3be1bd4536c9dce1/img_4322.jpg ) in the current days . 
  i dont want k\u00f6nigsberg ` back ' actually . 
  its far off our own territories and it has like 0.5 % ethnic germans or something . 
  pretty much everything that is german in that city are parts of its history and some buildings . 
  given that 78 % of its citizens are of russian origin , you can very much call it a `` russian '' city in my opinion . 
  all that op said apart from that last sentence whas directed at crimes . 
  and still , chernobyl was no `` evil thing '' that was `` done to someone '' . 
  it simply just happened , people fucked up . 
  get over it , if someone deserves an apologize it is the people who suffer ( ed ) from direct radiation and the people born with deformations because of it . 
  not you or us because some sheeps went radioactive and we had to turn our milk into cheese . 
  i do not think that you can blame any country for this , not the ukraine , not the soviet union and not russia . 
  no matter if people violated safety rules , nobody did this on purpose . 
  it simply does not qualify as `` committing a crime '' , and especially not against a country . 
  if anything , its own people were hurt by it , what we ` got ' is laughable compared to that . 
  seriously ? 
  russia ` invaded ' and defeated germany together with the western allies in ww2 . 
  however , this was nothing unexpected and ` justified ' since we were the ones attacking russia , not vice versa . 
  during the course of that , russian soldiers raped millions of german women ( this number is named by some historians , other sources say it was lower , but well into the hundred thousands ) , which is a crime , but german soldiers did the same in your country ( two wrongs dont make a right , but still ) . 
  after the war , your leadership established ` its ' part of germany as a satellite state and kept its inhabitants as prisoners of the east for about 30 years . 
  there were also millions of germans forced out of the former eastern territories . 
  did anybody apologize ? 
  i dont think so , but it was also not really due ( asides from expelling the people in the eastern territories maybe ) . 
  i am not even sure if everything falls under ` evil ' or ` crimes ' , we provoked and got a reaction , thats how war is . 
  i have seen ( actually read and heared of ) worse kinds of occupations . 
  the division of the country does not really harm the welldoing of the western sector . 
  the eastern part is not required to unleash the wests full potential , imo . 
  it will result in a smaller total economic power , but in relation , its fine . 
   belonging to a certain religion [ ... ] should not be protected under discrimination laws what ? 
  are you serious ? 
  i think it would be wrong to * apply * discrimination laws here as the alternative is these countries not taking in anybody , however faith is a valid thing to be protected by anti-discrimination laws . 
  i was talking percentage-wise . 
  if you take a look at the source i posted , the percentage went up by two points . 
  we also do not have a negative population growth rate by the way . 
  most ` young people ' i know still own a landline as they usually come for free with your internet contract . 
  well , the alternative is them not taking in anybody . 
  you can not legally force refugees upon a country , if the polish government does not agree , they wont get refugees resettled into their country . 
   we 've already seen it happen with slovakia and poland , are christian lives more valuable than muslim lives to europe ? 
  they simply feel that these people are likely more compatible with their country . 
  having a common faith is a good start if you have not much else in common . 
  justified or not , thats what they think and execute . 
  i would prefer them taking in christians over noone every day , and so should you , no matter what religion you are following . 
   why the blatant discrimination by some countries ? 
  as much as i usually am for equal treatment of humans , i would not go as far as calling it discrimination , or at least i would advocate for not applying discrimination laws here . 
  if they only took in people who speak polish , would it be discriminatory to all the ones who dont ? 
  if they take in christian refugees , we should be thankful to them for that , not shame them for it . 
  well , you especially mentioned me two times , so i somewhat had to feel adressed . 
  maybe i should have made my initial statement more clear . 
  i still disagree with most of the stuff you said , nevertheless . 
  i do not see this self-hate and other stuff you mentioned in the majority of people . 
  neither here , nor in the whole of europe . 
  still , proclaiming that it has to do with  shame for being `` privileged '' , white guilt , cultural relativism and all the post-modern relativistic nonsense or  self-hatred is just off and wrong . 
  you should probably specify what kind of medical tourism you want . 
  either you want the best possible treatment ( at least in europe ) or you are looking for a cheaper option . 
  its actually impressive how much you can misinterpret ones statement . 
  our current germany was founded in 1949 , simply not a lot of `` pride-worthy '' events happened since . 
  the time before 1933 was too long ago for me to take pride in personally . 
  yes , we actually have achieved a lot that we can be proud of , however most of that was a development and not some kind of `` moment '' that we can be proud of . 
  we did not fly to the moon , we did not win any wars , we did not have any succesful revolutions besides the one in 1989 ( if you want to call it one ) , but i already named that one . 
  i could go on , but i guess you get the point . 
  this has nothing to do with a feeling of guilt ( sorry that i am not being proud of military successes in ww2 ) , it has to do with a lack of astonishing events . 
  especially when we are talking about `` proudest '' moment , there are not a lot to choose from . 
  / u/fluchtpunkt made an excellent example with brandts kniefall , i am sorry that we do not take pride in things other people would maybe take pride in . 
  i for one am pretty proud of the non-violent , non-victorious moments of the kniefall and the reunification . 
  there are a lot of smaller situations that one can take somewhat pride in , however none of them qualify as `` proudest moment '' in my opinion . 
   sorry to disappoint , but i 'm not even making most of my money in germany , and it 's mostly not from wages . 
  why should that disappoint me ? 
   german real wages are at the same level as in the early 1990s . 
  nothing has improved for half the german population . 
  well , besides the unemployment being significantly lower than a decade ago . 
   that they are the problem if they lose their job , they 'll beat the smug out of your face , justifiably so . 
  likely both because of the same reason . 
  lack of education . 
  the voter ? 
  parliament directly , the other chamber is filled by the state governments . 
  it can be changed unless unconstitutional . 
  which it could be declared if the consitutional court sees it as an attempt to weaken it .
