   we would see . 
  i doubt that . 
  if you consider it a simple loan , we do not have jurisdiction over that . 
  if you consider it something else - aka reparations - they will tell you that there are no reparations to be payed . 
  but it 's all just hypothetical . 
  it will never happen . 
  your governments fear to damage the relationship with us . 
   what 's his argument ? 
  that germans imported goods to greece and greece should pay for them ? 
  even if they did n't agree to pay for them ? 
  unlike germany that said they would repay their debts ? 
  the argument is that germany sent substantial amounts of food * and * money into greece during the period of occupation . 
  his argument is that the often-quoted 476 million rm were not a loan , but a balance . 
  as i have outlined , the occupied country has to bear the costs of the occupation under the hague convention . 
  this viewpoint is backed up by documents in archives in germany and in greece . 
   because the soviet union , us et all decides so ? 
  simply because there is no legal way to do so . 
  the opinion of the mentioned nations matters as they were the negotiators in the 2 +4 treaty which effectively means that there wo n't be any reparations . 
  no country complained about or attacked that treaty , which means it exercises legal force . 
  that 's what many legal scholars argue , at least . 
   at the very least those countries could possibly try in german courts . 
  where they would lose . 
  again - even if your country or the balkan countries were as powerful as germany - there is no legal way to demand that money . 
  no court , no law , nothing . 
  all they could do would be entering arbitration , but that needs our consent . 
   no , that 's why they should/would have paid this decades ago . 
  this does n't make sense to me , but whatever . 
   where i do n't see anything . 
  not from under the car - on the very right of the picture . 
  but whether this is blood or not does n't really matter - better safe than sorry eh ? 
   source ? 
  read the further comment chain  ehh , they would be , because if the debt was defaulted on the central bank would have to fill that gap . 
  pay for it . 
  wait , the greek central bank still considers this money an asset ? 
  in the first picture , you can see something on the right that looks somewhat like a stream of blood as some people pointed out , also see added third image .

  you mean arbitration ? 
  if yes , this does n't work as you need our consent for that . 
  a small country could refuse to enter arbitration as well . 
  tell me where your government could legally demand compensation ? 
  in what court ? 
  which means that there is n't a legal handle to force us to pay anything , as i said . 
  according to the german government , the us , the uk , france and the soviet union/russia . 
  if the balkan governments actually believe that ( and not only made these claims for their domestic audience ) : bring it on . 
  we are pretty confident that we are right and that there is no legal handle to force us to pay anything in this regard . 
  it just is n't how this works . 
  you can not sit idle for thirty years and then come forth with a claim . 
  this does n't change anything about the fact that yugoslavia has no legitimate claims today ( legally speaking ) . 
  it could simply be a tool of protectionism as it puts the arab airlines at a competitive disadvantage . 
  security experts have argued that it is completely pointless - a notebook in the checked baggage can be equally dangerous . 
  not more ridiculous than demanding the money from germany today .

  you ignore quite a few things . 
  yugoslavia was part of and accepted the decision in the 1953 debt conference that postponed any potential reparations until after a peace treaty . 
  thing is : there never was a declaration of peace . 
  the 2 +4 contract explicitly * was n't * a declaration of peace to circumvent this issue . 
  the yugoslav government at that time did * not * contest the 2 +4 treaty and it did not bring up further repearations at that time . 
  given that almost three decades have passed since then , demanding it now is kind of ridiculous and the claim gets weaker with every year that passes . 
  payments that germany made were usually not official reparations . 
  they were reparations in kind , but they tried hard to avoid labelling it that way for various reasons . 
  take prof. heinz a. richter for example - widely regarded germanys leading expert on greek and cypriot history in the 20th century . 
  these claims are confirmed by both documents from the central bank of the third reich as well as by statements by konstantinos logothetopoulos , the second prime minister of the greek government that cooperated with the germans during the occupation . 
  he himself says that the claim would be equally ridiculous , but so is the greek claim .
