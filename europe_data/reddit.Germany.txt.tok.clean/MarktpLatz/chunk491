  somewhat . 
  they totally misunderstand this ruling . 
  i am not arguing anything , that 's actually what experts on this have argued . 
  and the stuff that had been imported into greece actually included money to stabilize the drachma . 
  the occupied country paying for the occupation is also a legitimate thing under the hague convention . 
  we are . 
  we are just opposed to paying ridiculous compensation for something that happened a century ago . 
  it does n't . 
  if anything , there is a moral obligation , there is n't a legal one . 
  sorry to disappoint you , but even if namibia was actually granted that money , it would not be a precedent for ww2 reparations as those have effectively been settled by the 2 +4 treaty . 
  germany is one of the few countries actually acknowledging the atrocities it committed in the past . 
  but hey , you do n't care , you are only out for germany-bashing anyways . 
  that 's a translation mistake . 
  the original ( german ) version talks about the icj - as do the other german newspapers reporting on this . 
  secondly , germany * has * submitted to the icj in 2008 - albeit with reservations :  germany 's acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the international court of justice  on 1 may 2008 , germany notified the secretary-general of the united nations that it had accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the international court of justice ( icj ) pursuant to article 36 paragraph 2 , of the statute of the icj . 
  only the day before , on 30 april 2008 , the federal government had approved this measure , bringing an end to a period of internal deliberation spanning almost thirty-five years . 
  indeed , ever since germany 's accession to the united nations in 1973 , lawyers from the federal foreign office have contemplated making such a declaration under the icj 's `` optional clause '' . 
   in recent years , germany has been a party to a number of proceedings before the icj . 
  in the legality of use of force case , the court rejected claims by the former yugoslavia against germany and other nato members based on the genocide convention of 1948 . 
  in the lagrand case , germany availed in its suit against the united states of america based on breaches of the vienna convention on consular relations of 1963 . 
  finally , in 2005 , the court rejected liechtenstein 's claims against germany in the certain property case . 
  no doubt , the positive outcomes of these proceedings helped win support within the federal government for the acceptance of the icj 's compulsory jurisdiction . 
   in line with international practice , ** germany 's declaration under the optional clause contains a number of reservations . 
  the declaration thus excludes disputes arising before the date of the declaration `` with regard to situations or facts '' prior to that date . 
  the main purpose of this clause is to exclude claims related to world war ii . 
  a further clause relates to cases where the parties have agreed on settlement by some other method and is designed to maintain the precedence of specific arrangements . 
  ** in particular , the jurisdiction of the international tribunal for the law of the sea remains unaffected . 
  a third additional clause is intended to avoid `` surprise '' applications by excluding disputes where the other party has accepted the icj 's jurisdiction less than twelve months prior to commencing the proceedings . 
  ** finally , the declaration excludes any dispute which `` ( a ) relates to , arises from or is connected with the deployment of armed forces abroad ** , involvement in such deployments or decisions thereon , or ( b ) relates to , arises from or is connected with the use for military purposes of the territory of the federal republic of germany , including its airspace , as well as maritime areas subject to german sovereign rights and jurisdiction '' . 
  while the first part of the reservation is not uncommon , the second part takes into account the fact that germany , after attaining full sovereignty following reunification , remains a major base for us - and nato-led military activities around the world . 
   by accepting the icj 's compulsory jurisdiction , germany has heeded the call from the 2005 world summit . 
  germany 's declaration is intended to strengthen international law in general and the peaceful settlement of disputes in particular . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.zaoerv.de/68_2008/68_2008_3_b_763_778.pdf ) so i woud argue that the chances of this going through are pretty much non-existent . 
  but there 's still the case in the us where they try this under the alien tort statute . 
  let 's see what comes from this ( does n't matter though , i have a hard time imagining that germany will give a single damn about the ruling of an us court under some ... let 's say law with ambitious reach ) . 
  ( what 's kind of ironic is that namibia has n't submitted to the icj by the way ), 
  that 's ... a totally different claim . 
  greece is n't paying anything on that . 
  ( and if we want to be pendantic , i would like to remind you that there are calculations that actually indicate the opposite - that the inflow of german goods and money into greece during that time actually was worth more than the loan which would result in a greek obligation to germany , confirmed by both greek and german sources . 
  so there is that . 
  but it is equally ridiculous to talk about this today . ), 
  if i check the last three months of your profile , only two german posts of yours have been removed - one because it lacked a translation and one because it was a dupe . 
  you can be pretty sure that they will get approved . 
   and greece is still paying of debts that were forced on them by germany during ww2 . 
  source ? 
  well , that 's a really complicated legal issue that you are touching here . 
  let me quote the german constitutional court on this ( 1972 ) :  `` the basic law ... assumes that the german reich survived the collapse in 1945 and that , neither the capitulation nor the exercise of alien authority in germany , caused the german reich to disappear . 
  the german reich still possesses legal capacity , although as an overall state it is not able to act in the absence of an organization , in particular in the absence of institutionalized organs [ ... ] the four powers bear the responsibility for `` germany as a whole '' [ together with the german states ] . 
   with the establishment of the federal republic [ of germany ] , there was n't a new western german state being founded , instead of this a part of germany was organized in a new way . 
  thus , the federal republic of germany is n't the legal successor of the german reich , but it is identical with the german reich , considering the terrritorial extent partially identical . 
   the german democratic republic belongs to germany and can not be seen as a foreign country in relation to the federal republic of germany ... 
  this is the position that most legal scholars and the german authorities ( maily courts ) take . 
  diplomatic actions between germany and third states have confirmed that position and if it was n't originally the case , it is international customary law by now . 
  it is disputed whether the the reunification was the foundation of a completely new state that in the same term abolished the german reich , but effectively it does n't matter .

  translation :  according to the acp coordination office , there will be no further election campaigns by turkish government representatives in germany before the constitutional referendum in turkey on 16 april . 
  this was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the coordination office of the turkish government , akp , on tuesday of the afp news agency . 
  the decision was taken in ankara , said the spokeswoman of the cologne-based coordination center . 
   the criticism of german politicians on the planned performances of turkish akp politicians met massive criticism . 
  hesse 's prime minister , volker bouffier ( cdu ) , said the turkish president erdogan was not welcome . 
  other prime ministers , such as annegret kramp-karrenbauer ( cdu ) , had issued a ban on their state of affairs . 
   in this context , foreign minister sigmar gabriel ( spd ) had demanded to omit nazi accusations , such as they were recently put forward by turkish president erdogan against the federal chancellor . 
  turkey was expressly referred to the german legal system , said gabriel on tuesday in berlin . 
  this includes paragraph 90a of the criminal code , according to which the federal republic of germany should not be condemned . 
  an equality with national socialism is such a contempt . 
   in the morning , turkish president erdogan renewed his criticism of europe , saying that the prohibitions were `` racist '' and `` fascist '' .
