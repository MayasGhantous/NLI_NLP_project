   can you imagine the outrage an american major newspaper would generate if they had an article like that ? 
  well , i do n't exactly like the title of the article either . 
  the article itself is better . 
   even trump is left wing compared to denmark smh . 
  i disagree . 
  yup that 's an accurate translation of an article from one of the major danish newspapers . 
  sounds good to me . 
  could you at least use an english title ? 
  well , the president of france is still more powerful .

  france ? 
  removed . 
  questions of this kind belong into / r/askeurope . 
  you could also ask it in / r/germany as it is only about germany . 
  to answer your question : according to diplomatic protocol , the german president is the head of the state and also the highest-ranking office in the country . 
  his role is mainly symbolic/ceremonial however , he does n't hold much power . 
  if you want a comparison , imagine the queen of england . 
  the `` real '' power in the country belongs to the chancellor . 
  due to the topic , an early warning from us mods at this point : `` white genocide '' rhetoric , hatespeech and racism in general wo n't be tolerated . 
  please stay civil !, 
  disclaimer : the corrections that kapom mentions were made because the prior translations were inaccurate , not to push a certain agenda . 
  it 's alright . 
  it would have been fine with us to include that part since it contains very relevant information . 
  but hey , nothing that a tag ca n't fix eh ? 
  mind to repost that with a proper title ? 
  the messed up '' & '' sign does n't look pretty .

  i generally do n't see the point in these petitions to be honest . 
  i have already seen that map . 
  does n't change the fact that there are thousands of votes from areas of the uk that are not scotland . 
  yeah . 
  stuff like this is totally obsolete especially when we already know that a large part of the scottish population is opposed it . 
   we in scotland -  signatures from all over the uk,
