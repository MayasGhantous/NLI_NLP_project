  we 're a bit short on staff today . 
  dealt with it now . 
   i did n't say all germans are shit , i said a country which was historically anti-semitic , like most other european countries . 
  germany is by far not the only `` historically anti-semitic '' country . 
  of course , you can not compare these things to the holocaust . 
   we have every right to be suspicious of them . 
  you do , but do imply that us being a new generation does n't matter whatsoever . 
   i really do n't know what else to say , if you read my last comment i said germans of today are n't responsible at all , but of course you ignored that . 
  i have read that . 
  i just do n't feel that i 'm taken seriously when you ask me whether `` i consider german guilt a myth '' after i have explained to you how i feel about it already . 
  i did read your previous comments , i just saw no point in answering them . 
  for multiple reasons : you do not appear to care about anything i argue , you essentially just say that it does n't matter and that we germans are shit . 
  secondly , you base arguments off things on reddit which is totally ridiculous . 
  3 could be merkel , 14 juncker . 
   i mean , all paradox games have no swastikas ( hoi and vicky2 specifically ) with them explicitly saying that it is due to the prohibitions in germany . 
  you can not blame germany for that however . 
  many other producers simply put out two versions - which is n't all that complicated . 
  essentially , they are just being lazy . 
   aye , but that is currently not the case in germany where there have been at least 2 top ruling stating video games are not art and thus are to be regulated like other non-artforms . 
  there has n't been a top court ruling on this as far as i know . 
  the relevant court ruling on displaying forbidden symbols in computer/video games is from 1998 , was about wolfenstein 3d from 1992 and was n't from the highest court . 
   it 's absurd if you ask me but , in my earnest opinion , the whole debate should n't even be happening in the first place . 
  i strongly oppose state censorship , art or not . 
  i 'm a bit split on this . 
  i personally think that these symbols should n't be banned in computer games etc. 
  but i can totally get behind a ban of displaying it in public in germany . 
  it just dies n't send a good message when you see nazis marching around in nazi gear in germany . 
   i do n't think germans will put zombie hitler back into power the moment someone can show a swastika in a video game . 
  it 's not even clear whether this is the case . 
  there has never been a top court ruling in germany that this is n't allowed . 
  there are lawyers and legal scholars who would claim that these games are `` art '' and thus free to show these signs . 
  the companies producing the games simply have chosen the safe path so far . 
  and i can not blame them - it does n't hinder their sales and risking to lose a game release due to the game being suspended by a lower court is n't really a good business move . 
  implying that these laws are the only thing preventing us from immediately turning into nazis again is kind of ridiculous .

  i do not reject the notion that bannon might have influence over this , the us will most certainly play a role here . 
  nevertheless , i disagree with ranking him that highly . 
  this seriously ranks bannon above the eu parliament in importance for the uk which is ridiculous .
