  interesting . 
  for some unknown reason , reddit goes totally mad when the topic is gypsies . 
  inaccurate . 
  comments were n't removed because they said that gypsy kids were behind this , many of them implied that gypsies were some kind of subhumans .

  serious answer : antifa is the acronym for the german-speaking equivalent of the [ anti-fascist action ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-fascist_action ) . 
  the claim is total nonsense of course . 
  this has actually happened in the past , by the way : the pds made it to the parliament with just 4.4 % of secondary votes in the 1994 election , the dp made it into the parliament with under 5 % of votes in 1953 and 1957 .

  * 1 direct mandate , party below 5 % -  1 mp * 3 or more direct mandates , party below 5 % -  party gets mps according to their share of votes, 
  no personal attacks please , no matter who you are talking to .

   the states have different rules regarding their parliaments with lower thresholds and guaranteed seats for minorities ( like you guys ) . 
  the 5 % threshold does n't apply to minorities on the federal level either ( \u00a7 6 iii 2 bwahlg ) . 
  the mentioned ssw had an mp in the bundestag between 1949-1953 ( this was before the rules were changed however ) . 
   however on the national level 5 % is the threshold to form a `` fraction '' or caucus in the parliament as well as getting seats via the 2nd vote . 
  mps elected directly via the 1st vote get in regardless of their parties performance ( or whether they even have a party ) . 
  additionally , you get full representation if your party manages to reach three direct mandates , even if your total vote count is below 5 % . 
  well , it wo n't matter any more to us , i have just proposed to add the info site to our banned domain list . 
  right now , lesoir.info is linking directly to lesoir.be, 
  no personal attacks please . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  certain legal status ( being in germany alone does n't qualify you for citizenship ) , having spent a certain amount of time in germany . 
  fulfilling language requirements , passing an immigration test . 
  additionally , it is required that applicants have been able to provide for themselves and their family without state support for several years and that they have n't committed any major crimes . 
  it takes more than \u201e signing a document `` do aquire any of these nationalities and you know that .

  send a modmail to the team after posting and they will sticky it . 
  removed . 
  off topic . 
  honestly , the result negotiated by the eu sounds perfectly reasonable . 
  it 's rather unlikely that greek exporters will lose market share in canada because they are allowed to continue to name their stuff `` feta '' .

  low quality . 
  this does n't make sense either .
