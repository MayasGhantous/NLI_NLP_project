  everyone in germany knows what merkel looks like on vacation and a picture like this is very unlikely to affect her public perception . 
  this does n't even remotely correlate with this submission ? 
  do n't tell me that unilateral efforts from the eu or us would have worked better . 
  it got russia to the table and the fact that they try hard to get rid of them shows that they do care . 
  of course sanctions are n't a solution for everything - the ukraine situation is far from solved , but they have worked as well as one could expect them to work . 
  that 's completely irrelevant to this ? 
  the ns2 consortium tried to consult with poland and the baltics on the pipeline , but there are clear fronts . 
  we support it , they oppose it . 
  it is different on sanctions against russia . 
  sanctions work best when they are enacted by the us and the eu together . 
  cooperation also allows to find measures that do the least harm to `` our side '' while doing as much as possible to them . 
  do n't try deflecting this on other issues . 
  coordination on sanctions is the preferable option and there is no good reason for the us to stop the cooperation . 
  this does n't make the move without consultations any better . 
  the `` joint front '' approach has worked well , there is no reason to change the way of going along . 
  this is the first set of sanctions that was enacted without prior consultation between the us and europe . 
  claiming that `` it calls for talks with europe '' is a weak excuse . 
  talks and negotiations should happen before voting on stuff like this . 
  the financing gap is the least of our problems . 
  your net contribution to the eu could be covered by our budget surplus alone . 
  we already own a lot of greek debt . 
  there is n't much more that we could be held accountable for . 
  the maximum loss for germany in the greek crisis is around 80 bn . 
  this could be changed . 
  the issue is this : more than two years might be \u201e needed `` given how things are going currently . 
  no deal is bad for both sides . 
  well , it is possible to extend the art .

   sieferle writes extensively about `` social democratism '' and sneers at the german chicken-hut , which is frightened by every fox . 
  but this is how the edel edders in conservative mansions are talking about . 
  only in the last part of the book white man , why finis germania had to land in schnellroda , in the hands of a rightradical bifurcator . 
  this part of the book is of select obscenity , and goes out to the assertion , the jews will be our destiny , the man will not cite it : the jews had murdered the gods , and though they had never admitted their guilt , the sole gracious christian god was soon recaptured in the table fellowship . 
   the germans according to their `` monstrosities '' ( `` the ominous six million '' ) you can see the jews of world history . 
  siefer 's theorem is also singular , that auschwitz was `` inflated to an unquestionable truth , '' the `` last myth '' of a thoroughly rationalized world . 
  the shameless subtext reads : first , the jews dodged the ancient myths and , with moral universalism , plunged the ancient gods from the throne , and then , according to the holocaust , ordered mankind a substitute myth . 
  they build `` memorial sites in all the world , in which the power of eternal reprobation is attributed not only to the victims of the moral superiority , but also to the perpetrators . '', 
  `` wanted risky '' the mirror editor calls the book and recommended it for the best list .

  they have around 7000 visitors a day in summer . 
  it 's hardly possible to get even more people through it .

  ... because that would n't be accurate or original ? 
  neuschwanstein has enough visitors as it is right now . 
  also [ schloss hohenschwangau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hohenschwangau_castle ) , which is finished , is right next to it . 
  meh , neuschwanstein is overrated . 
  ludwig died before it was finished which means that from the inside , it is mostly emptly . 
  it 's nice to look at tho . 
  the commission is n't `` run by germany '' and has proven time and time again that they are willing to go up against germany . 
  given the development status of china and india , that 's not exactly unfair . 
  i am aware of the political realities in the us . 
  half of the gop candidates promised to `` rip up this terrible deal on day one '' and the others were n't exactly fond of it either . 
  since it is trump acting here ( even if it is on behalf of parts of `` his '' party ) , i think the statement is n't exactly wrong .

  good . 
  handle it a bit like the paris accord . 
  there is no reason to pull out of good agreements because trump does n't like them . 
  it makes sense if you look at it in the context of this thread . 
  several people brought up that `` sanctioning ns2 is good because it runs counter to the eu efforts for energy diversification '' . 
  hence why i mentioned that enforcing that policy ( which would potentially mean going up against ns2 ) is the business of the eu . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is a question better suited for / r/askeurope .

  actually i have not claimed that ns2 supports energy diversification . 
  it does the opposite .

  the people are well aware of how merkel does politics . 
  we do not allow news articles older than six months . 
  apart from that - this statement is n't contradictory to merkels acting in the refugee crisis . 
  this article is seven years old . 
  seriously ?

  as i have stated before , it is possible to access deleted posts , they are not deleted , `` only '' hidden . 
  they can still be accessed through comments in that thread , through the profile of the person posting it and if you have the direct link . 
  eu energy policy is eu . 
  nothing of that comes even close to what they did in the us . 
  there was an effort to meddle in france , but it did n't have any impact , and the german election did n't even happen yet . 
  provide evidence for that . 
  you really fail to see that this is mainly about meddling in the us election ? 
  the eu has a lot of sanctions against russia due to the situation in ukraine . 
  well , provide some sources backing that claim . 
   literally everything you just argued is minor semantics . 
  these `` minor sematics '' make a major difference . 
  the rest of your comment is actually not relevant to this discussion in any way . 
  as you might see , it was not me removing that submission and as you were told in modmail , there had been several reports about that prior to your post . 
   oh really , siemens sued russia for giving them turbines ? 
  for russia lying about where they will use them ? 
  yes .
