  i have never rejected that it goes against the interest of eastern europe . 
  this does n't mean that i have to oppose ns2 . 
  i believe that the eastern european opposition of ns2 is hypocritical ( see for example ss or hungary right now ) . 
  my personal opinion also does n't matter - i can differenciate between modding and personal commenting . 
  i have n't had a * single * case where my fellow mods corrected me on a decision on a post or comment about germany . 
  the arguments people bring up here - eu energy security , eu energy diversification and inner eu relations * are * inner-eu dealings . 
  europe surely cared . 
  europe willingly harmed itself economically to sanction russia . 
  do n't make up stuff that you can not prove . 
  first of all `` everyone elses '' is inaccurate . 
  it is only eastern europe complaining . 
  the other countries are either fine with it , take part in it or do not care . 
  and no , no matter whether this decision is pro-germany or anti-germany , the us should not have a say . 
  the eu should . 
  eu laws have not been modified for germany here . 
  there seriously is no evidence of that . 
  feel free to point examples out . 
  i am certain that you wo n't be able to present anything in this regard . 
   you 're asking us to basically clear all unilateral foreign policy on russia through you first , else face retaliation , because you 're dependent on russia & have economic ties with them . 
  if it affects us - sure . 
  which is why this was handled this way so far . 
  and that 's a fair stance to take , but only eu countries and the eu should have a say here - and not the us . 
  scandinavia is sceptical but does n't openly oppose it . 
  eastern europe fears for its transit fees . 
  as proven by the fact that hungary recently withdrew its opposition due to a lucrative deal with gazprom or that eastern europe supported south stream , even though it would have done exactly the same . 
  every country here is in for their own benefit . 
   germany indeed argues that only russia has jurisdiction on the offshore part , but it is questionable wether that will stand , and even if , the pipeline is going to hit shore . 
  the commission agrees with germany on that and it is very unlikely that the ecj or any other authority will say that this is inaccurate . 
   this has nothing to do with transit fees . 
  so how do you explain that hungary recently stepped back from opposing it due to a lucrative deal with gazprom ? 
  the main reason for these countries to oppose it is that they fear for financial loss . 
  once more , this is up to the eu to decide , not up to the us . 
   i can not comprehend how they chose you as a mod . 
  are the standards for r/europe 's mods so low ? 
  i can differenciate between personal opinion and modding , thank you .

  you are certainly not european . 
  it can never be in the european interest to have the us have authority over inner-eu dealings . 
  this does n't make it any better ? 
  also , it is n't relevant whether eastern europe backs this move . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  on eu energy security , the eu is the only body with the authority . 
  ukraine is a different topic and not wanting to cut all relations with russia does n't equal being `` protector of russia '' . 
  bashing russia is easy if you do n't have anything to lose . 
  of course , we are not able to tell you who to sanction or not . 
  i am just saying that all the arguments here ( `` us is caring about eu energy policy '' ) are void as these objectives are not the business of the us . 
  how does that justify the us ' actions ? 
  the proper body to take the decisions in this regard is the eu . 
  not the us . 
  again , this is still not in the authority of the us . 
  the only authority here is the eu . 
  not the us and not individual member states . 
  how is that even relevant ? 
  it could be about putin upsetting trump , would n't change anything in this regard . 
  if you take steps that harm the economic interests of your allies , you should talk to them first and try to get them on board . 
   as the guarantor of european security , it very much the us 's business . 
  nope . 
   nor is it up to germany to decide what these interests are , and when they are harmed . 
  hence why it is up to the eu to watch over this . 
   the whole project revolves around germany . 
  do n't blame foreign companies participating in it . 
  i do n't `` blame '' anyone . 
  it 's just plain wrong to claim that germany would be the only country benefitting here . 
   well , the sanctions are kinda our business . 
  not if the sanctions only harm russia and your allies . 
  sanctions that harm your allies should be discussed with said allies first , as it has been standard procedure in the past . 
   as for the whole energy thing , well , it 's not like you gave a shit when fellow eu member-states in scandinavia & eastern europe objected to it ... so ... eh ... that 's not exactly comparable . 
  if you would spend a little time educating yourself on this issue , you would notice that ns2 does * not * violate eu law . 
  none of this is the business of the us . 
  it is not up to the us to decide what harms european interests , it is not up to the us to enforce european energy policy . 
  and it is n't like the us would be taking these actions for this reason in the first place . 
  and no , there are several european countries involved here , not just germany . 
   forcing america to pretty much handle everything until the infighting could be settled ( i.e. 
  the famous `` fuck the eu , we 'll go through the un '' remark ) . 
  you make it sound like the us is the `` hero '' that can simply take the lead here . 
  here 's the facts : europe will naturaly be more reluctant on a response to russia than the us because sanctioning russia actively harms us ... a lot . 
  germany has lost about twice as much in exports to russia than the us exports to russia in total . 
  the us does n't really have anything to lose when sanctioning russia , there is n't a diplomatic or economic relationship worth speaking of . 
  this is different for many european countries .

  actually it is very clear where europe is going to retaliate : if us actions directly harm eu/european interests . 
  be it through tariffs ( steel etc. ), 
  or sanctions that directly harm some of our members . 
  everything else that is happening in the us at the moment is mainly fucking over the us and not really affecting us directly . 
  health care , tax reform , military spending in the us , collusion etc. 
  is really none of our business .
