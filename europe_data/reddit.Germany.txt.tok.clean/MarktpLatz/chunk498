  holy mother of editorialization . 
  this is totally unacceptable and a violation of our rules . 
  consider this a warning . 
  this is n't really how this works . 
  the eu wo n't die because of something like this . 
  it did n't die either when orb\u00e1n did similar stuff in hungary . 
  how does that even make sense ?

  oh , do n't get me wrong . 
  i dislike them as well . 
  i did n't mean my comment as a supportive statement , but rather as a reply to you writing that it was `` awful preparation '' , which i contest . 
  because the csu lobbies for it , in fact it is one of their core proposals for the next election and they have threatened not to enter a coalition without such a limit . 
  and while i maintain that such a limit would be unconstitutional , one of our former constitutional court judges has written a legal opinion that it could be possible . 
   pis is to be blamed for awful preparation of the reform would n't you agree that , from pis ' standpoint , the preparation is actually how they want it to be ? 
  especially when it comes to * very * controversial stuff ( which i would argue this `` reform '' is ) , politicians or parties tend to try to rush the laws through parliament to ensure that there is no way to organize major public opposition to it . 
  you are completely misinterpreting her statement .

  this comparison is wrong on so many levels i do not even know where to start . 
  most of the laws that applied during the nazi time are still in effect today ( bgb/stgb etc. ) . 
  many of the laws enacted during the nazi time were a perversion of the rule of law and should thus not be considered as such . 
  so you have no real arguments why europe is n't `` faring well '' apart from an abstract fear that it might get worse in the future ? 
  ... which is completely irrelevant to ops point . 
  according to your flair , you are australian . 
  how would you know ? 
  life is pretty much better than ever before in northern europe . 
  was n't me who created this , i am only quoting the creator . 
  there is a difference between claiming asylum and being granted asylum . 
  we have fared well without it so far and we will continue to do so in the future . 
  poverty is n't a reason for asylum anyways . 
  rule of law is n't insanity . 
  you do not understand the fundamental principles of state souvereignty . 
  it simply does n't matter what our laws are in this regard . 
  again , the laws are n't the real issue here . 
  if pakistan refuses to take its people back , there is n't * anything * we can do . 
  we can change laws all we want in this regard , it wo n't change anything in regards to pakistan . 
  putting people in camps for a decade is n't something that is n't ever `` fine '' unless we are talking about people being in prison for serious crimes . 
  oh god no he has screenshotted my comment . 
  conspiracy much ? 
  dude , you really need a hobby or something . 
  this obsession of accusing me of allegedly censoring everything i do n't like ca n't be healthy . 
  what is even wrong with you ? 
  i have n't even been modding today . 
  being a mod is n't my job and i am free to make the decision to engage in a discussion instead . 
  seriously , sod off . 
  this should n't be something that should be applied today . 
  these days are fortunately gone . 
  we believe in diplomacy , not raw brutforce strength . 
   there are ships filled with fighting age men , some of whom we know to be enemy combatants . 
  we have no duty to welcome them , as i said : this does n't make them an `` aggressive force '' attacking europe that needs to be repelled by the military . 
  regular coast guard boats can do that . 
   blockage the ports and prevent any ships containing illegal people from entering our waters in the first place . 
  that would be a violation of state souvereignty . 
   i do n't care . 
  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/15/saudi-arabia-has-100000-air-conditioned-tents-sitt/ could be a start . 
  `` i do n't care '' is just a lazy excuse for you not having a solution . 
  the problem is this : there is no country in the mediterranean which is not in the eu and willing to take refugees . 
  not a single one of the northern african states is willing to let us open such a camp there . 
  mentioning saudi arabia in this context is ridiculous because they do not want it and are also far away . 
   yes , it is . 
  once their war if finished , so to is their right to asylum . 
  all we need do is provide them refuge for the time their war is active . 
  this works if an end to the war is in sight . 
  which it is n't in syria . 
   then we 'll drop the deportees off at the border of the warzone . 
  illegal as well . 
  the quota was never about refugees in germany . 
  this still means that they need to be repealed , otherwise they still apply . 
  and no , our human right laws are not outdated or anything . 
   because we need a military solution to enforce our land and sea borders . 
  you make it sound like there are war ships heading for europe . 
  this is a job for frontex , with the support of the national navies , not for nato . 
   which is why my ideal would be setting up camps on non-european soil ( like australia ) . 
  and where exactly do you want to do that ? 
   yes it is . 
  they have no right to our countries , no right to our services - they have a right to not be in a warzone , that is all . 
  it is n't a `` solution '' as i said . 
   then the get deported . 
  do they want shelter from war , or are they looking for a free-ride ? 
  they can be grateful for our shelter from their war , or they can go home to defend their land . 
  human rights deport even those from deportation into war areas . 
  and also : camps do not abolish the problems we have with deportations currently . 
   do they get deported ? 
  we try to . 
   also do rejected applicants receive any benefits ? 
  those that can not be deported do . 
  if you can not be deported due to illness or lack of papers , you get the `` tolerated '' status which means that you will get housing and financial benefits . 
  the person in question has to prove that they are trying to get rid of these obstacles however ( e.g. 
  get their papers ) , otherwise the benefits will be reduced to the bare legal minimum ( this is germany after all ) and the benefits can be replaced with benefits in kind . 
  we are already attempting to do that ? 
  it just is n't that easy .
