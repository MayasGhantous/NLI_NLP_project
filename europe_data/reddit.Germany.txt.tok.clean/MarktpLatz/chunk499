  also there are a * lot * of countries involved here . 
  the actual capacity is one thing , the number the society is willing to accept another thing . 
  the latter is the more important thing , but the current level ( 200-300k / year ) seems perfectly tolerable for germany . 
  laws do not have an expiration date ( unless explicitly stated otherwise ) . 
  unless they are repealed , they apply . 
  and additionally , there is still a need for these laws . 
  i do n't even know why you are mentioning nato in this context . 
  that 's way out of their field of operations . 
  frontex is the agency available . 
  and your approach does n't work : once on european soil , european laws , including asylum laws , apply . 
  putting people into camps for years is n't a solution . 
  it very likely violates human rights and it is also a breeding ground for terrorism and crime . 
   do i understand it right that majority of rejected asylum seekers get that ? 
  you do n't . 
  here are the numbers for 2017 ( jan-june ) : * 20.9 % refugee status * 17.1 % subsidiary protection * 6.7 % no protection , but can not be deported * 39.1 % rejected * 16.1 % formal decisions ( rejected because asylum seeker withdrew application or because the person has applied for asylum before ) [ source : bamf ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl-juni-2017.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  this is n't how any of this works . 
  the issue are n't the laws in place . 
  the issues are the governments of the countries these people come from ( state souvereignty is a thing ) refusing to take their people back .

  source :  data is from wikipedia opinion polling summaries for each country and using the average of polls ending within the last month ( or the last four months where no such polls were available , marked with an asterisk ) . 
  exception is lithuania which used data from [ electograph electomonitor ] ( http://www.electograph.com/p/electomonitor.html#lithuania ) and countries such as france and the netherlands where actual election results are used ( it does n't seem there 's much interest in polling there with the next elections so far away ) . 
   wikipedia definitions also used for `` eurosceptic '' , if this term is used to refer to the party ( in its current form ) on its page they are classed as such . 
  a few judgement calls were made . 
  spain is a particularly tricky one because of [ podemos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/podemos_ ( spanish_political_party ) ) and the broader coalition [ unidos podemos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unidos_podemos ) , i ultimately included these as eurosceptic but note this is a high-end estimate .

  that was never the reason for accepting the people in the first place . 
  that 's actually complete bs . 
  germany did not accept people `` because we trust these countries '' . 
  and yeah , we actually have legititmate reasons not to trust ukraine with gas . 
  again . 
  there is no evidence that merkel is in any way responsible here .

  of course the eu is more than germany . 
  but eu does n't mean taking care of everyones interests 100 % of the time . 
  if interests collide , there will always be someone who loses out . 
   yup , but we do n't claim moral superiority nor we have a claim of leading the eu or speaking in the name of it while pursuing our narrow economical interest . 
  where does germany claim `` moral superiority '' in this regard ? 
  the only one claiming a `` moral highround '' here is you . 
  and as i have said before , i am mainly defending germany on ns2 because i believe that the criticism of the eastern countries is n't genuine . 
  actions like the one i linked just prove my point . 
  i do not believe that your countries care about the `` energy diversification of europe '' or about `` ukraine '' . 
  your countries care for your own benefit first and foremost . 
  the only legitimate reason i see to oppose ns2 is energy security for those that get bypassed and i believe that we need to work on measures to ensure that . 
  no , you are just making up ridiculous arguments about what is `` against the eu '' . 
  this is n't even how any of this works . 
  the transit fees are n't paid to `` the people '' . 
  it is n't germanys responsibility to prop up the budget of ukraine . 
   i should had formulated it better - which country is colluding more with russia , us or germany ? 
  i dislike the word `` colluding '' in this context . 
  and i have already answered that question . 
   http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-17-1571_en.htm i do n't exactly know what kind of response you want to that . 
   so ukrainians will freeze in a neutral matter . 
  but hey , let 's look at the positives : if ukraine collapses due to extreme german greed i do n't think v4 will object taking their fair share of ukrainian refugeesbutthemajoritywillstillgotogermany big words given that hungary just proven that ukraine is worth protecting as long as it serves [ hungarian interests ] ( http://www.worldoil.com/news/2017/7/7/hungary-commits-to-russia-gas-route-as-poland-looks-to-us ) . 
  apparently , ukrainians will also `` collapse due to extreme hungarian greed '' . 
  all countries are mainly in for their own profit here , every single one is willing to let ukraine go if the price is high enough . 
  poland is a part of eu . 
  actions against poland are against eu . 
  unless you belive only germany interests are eu interests and it 's ok for germany to screw up other eu countries . 
  simply not the case . 
  not everything another eu member dislikes is an `` action against the eu ''  3 . no one is more hypocritical in this than germany . 
  south stream did n't reinstated unholy russia-germany alliance against eeu . 
  besides south stream does not exist , nord stream does . 
  how can you not see it 's of paramount importance and its poisoning eu relations ? 
  i do not understand what you are saying here . 
   4 . eu is always relevant if eu countries are involved . 
  or am i missing something ? 
  because i hear a lot about unity etc. 
  especially especially from german politicians and media . 
  eu needs to be involved where it has competence . 
  it does n't here . 
  provide any reliable source stating that germany opposed south stream . 
  edit : merkel even lobbied to restart ss after the building process was halted . 
  [ link ] ( http://de.reuters.com/article/eu-south-stream-bulgarien-merkel-iddekbn0jt1k220141215 ) ( german ) . 
  there is nothing `` anti eu '' about it . 
  poland is looking out for its own interest . 
  the countries opposing this are hyprocritical . 
  pretty much all of them supported south stream which would have done pretty much the same . 
  the eu is n't even relevant in this regard as this falls out of eu legislation . 
  nothing of what you just wrote is even remotely relevant to this topic or in fact relevant in any way to the current day .
