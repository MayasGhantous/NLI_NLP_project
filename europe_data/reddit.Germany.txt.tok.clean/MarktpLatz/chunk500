   based on facts which country would you say wants closer economic relationships with russia post crimea invasion ? 
  us or germany ? 
  that 's not the point and also a misleading argument . 
  of course it will be germany . 
  but the same is true for pretty much any other european country apart from those that used to be under russian influence . 
  thats simply because russia-europe ties are bigger than us-russia ties . 
   is ns2 inline with the eu directive of reducing dependency from russia ? 
  yes or no ? 
  it is n't . 
   is ns2 helping with achieving another eu goal of having a common energy market ? 
  if yes , how ? 
  neutral in this regard . 
   good news is that ec is doing germany 's whoring and came up with a version where no eu member will loose . 
   minsk word is not present in the article . 
  us senate sanctions is . 
  the author talks about two of our ministers taking a `` softer line '' . 
  in this regard , minsk is what matters . 
   agree for poland , not for the rest of transit countries which country will increase its dependency on russian gas due to this ? 
   if from german pow it can be seen as `` gifting '' then from a non-german pow can be seen as `` stealing '' . 
  `` not gifting '' is not `` stealing '' . 
  `` not gifting '' is completely neutral . 
  you do know that germany * supported * south stream ? 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  we are n't stealing a lolly from a toddler here . 
  we are not `` stealing '' money from anybody . 
  this term is wrong and you know that . 
   why do you assume that even government appointed judges will not be independent in their rulings ? 
  let 's say the chance is higher than in cases where the government does n't approve them . 
  and even though judges are independent in their ruling , their selection can make a lot of difference when it comes to the outcome of their decisions . 
   why do you think current situation is different ? 
  it 's not like pis is appointing its party members as judges . 
  pis has been trying really hard to get `` their '' judges onto the tribunal . 
  it is n't like it would n't matter who appoints the judges . 
  and additionally , there is the fact that pis was hindered significantly by the supreme court when they were in office the last time . 
  everything looks like they are trying to remove an `` obstacle '' to their agenda . 
  the rule change on how the judgements of the court are made is worrisome as well . 
   did you asked the opinion of the ones who will not win financially as well ? 
  yes , we did actually . 
  it 's just that several countries were not even interested to talk about it . 
  they simply said that they will oppose it . 
   i do n't think the author refers to minsk but the us senate one . 
  i do n't think so . 
  he is referencing our ministers . 
   poland has a pipe with russia , also some countries on the path ( e.g. 
  slovakia are to lose a lot in transit fees ) . 
  yeah , but the `` must increasingly rely on russian gas '' part does n't make sense . 
   ns2 is then `` stealing '' ... no , how could it be ? 
  ukraine has no `` right '' to be chosen as route for transfers . 
  nothing is `` stolen '' here . 
  honestly , if your economy relies on being `` in the way '' , you should probably try to improve in other areas . 
  it is n't a `` legit '' reason not to build ns2 . 
  cutting out the transit fees is part of the plan and totally legit . 
   so judges are not choosing themselves ? 
  how quaint . 
  but if poland do the same it 's an end of democracy ? 
  the 2/3 majority does make a difference , and so does the fact that the parliament only chooses 50 % of the judges . 
   your government coalition controls how much of the bundestag ? 
  can we safely say that government appoints supreme court judges ? 
  as we do have a grand coalition , they do right now . 
  however , that 's far from the normal case and the fact that it includes different parties also ensures that the candidates will be a compromise . 
  also , the `` other chamber '' which appoints the other half of the judges is n't controlled by the current government parties . 
   look , i know it 's worrying but you must understand that judges in poland created a hereditary caste , they often incompetent and corrupt but always privileged and untouchable , they have immunity from prosecution even in case of a murder , germany probably have some system that does not allow judiciary to protect criminals in their ranks , in poland its a standard , system its inefficient , corrupt and in dire need of reform . 
  as long as it is ensured that the government does n't simply approves judges at its liking , that 's a fair goal . 
  but it seems to me that this is n't the case . 
   the nord stream 2 agreement , signed without consultation with eu partners inaccurate . 
  there are other european countries taking part in this . 
  the countries along the route of ns2 were also contacted . 
   the german government 's economics minister and foreign minister ( both members of the german grand coalition ) openly favor deeper business ties with russia despite its illegal crimean annexation , armed conflict in ukraine , and clandestine cyberattacks throughout europe . 
  to these misdeeds , germany 's powerful putin versteher ( `` understanders '' ) say that politics should not stand in the way of business . 
  simply not accurate . 
  all our ministers insist on fulfilling the minsk agreement before sanctions are lifted . 
  the only difference is this : many politicians here do not want to lift sanctions until minsk is completely fulfilled . 
  some of the politicians of the spd favour a gradual removal : process on the objectives of minsk would result in the sanctions being gradually lifted . 
   the nord stream 2 project appeared to overcome its financing hurdle when five of europe 's largest energy companies ( the three biggest contributors being german and austrian ) agreed on april 24 , 2017 , to finance half of the $ 10.3 billion project , with gazprom paying for the remaining half and retaining control of the project . 
  it was always intended to be financed 50/50 ? 
   nord stream 2 threatens to deprive ukraine of $ 2 billion a year in transport revenues . 
  that 's not an argument against ns2 . 
  germany has no obligation to `` gift '' money to ukraine . 
   poland and other central european countries , which account for 20 percent of russian gas deliveries , are a third opponent of nord stream 2 . 
  they stand to lose gas transported through ukraine . 
  under nord stream 2 , these countries must increasingly rely on russian gas delivered to germany this does n't even make sense . 
  linkedin was used for spam , rt is an agenda-pushing unreliable mouthpiece of the kremlin . 
   appointing krs judges by parliament is similar to german system . 
  that 's not accurate . 
  half our supreme court judges are appointed by our first chamber , the other half by the second chamber . 
  2/3 majority ensures that the governing party can not simply put any judge it likes into office .
