  it certainly played a role ( see spike at the end ) , but it was far from the only reason . 
  [ pis had been set to win even prior to the refugee crisis ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/model_sonda%c5%bcy.png/800px-model_sonda%c5%bcy.png ) . 
  sure , it had an impact , but the simple correlation `` refugees -  pis '' does n't exist . 
  there are more facets to that issue . 
  makes your point kind of void though . 
  at the point of the election in poland , it was entirely unclear what the qualification of those people was . 
  at the point of the polish election , pretty much no refugee had arrived in poland .

   why not let the sub use upvotes and downvotes to decide for themselves whether a news story is significant ? 
  because that does n't work . 
  reddits system is deeply flawed , a laissez-faire approach to moderation does not work . 
  you could see on / r/european where a non-moderated subreddit ends .

  it is possible that i got a bit carried away with that line . 
  i mainly wanted to express that i was/we were upset that people were deliberatly trying to post so much different shit that we could not deal with it anymore . 
   i honestly think that allowing such articles to be posted on this subreddit will directly reduce the quality of the content and the discussions they spark . 
  we are doing this to evaluate exactly that . 
  we as the mod team are not exactly overeager to bring thelocal back , but we have had many complaints over the years about thelocal being banned and we simply want to check that .

  this does n't work , unfortunately . 
  first of all , sticky space is very limited ( we only have two slots ) and we simply do n't have a slot available every day . 
  secondly , it is not us mods who set ( or should set ) these trends , they are somewhat organic . 
  last but not least , megathreads are horrible and kill most of the discussion .

  sure , that 's annoying as well . 
  we try our best to remove duplicates , but as i said elsewhere , doing more on actual news would be akin random censorship . 
  we do not plan to get rid of them completely . 
  we just want them to be at a reasonable quantity . 
   if you do n't like them , downvote them , or stick to other threads . 
  does n't work . 
  we do n't intend to kill them completely . 
  the spam * was * super real . 
  sure , as i said , we do not dislike these posts in general . 
  we just dislike being flooded by them . 
  there is already a possibility to do that manually through res : [ click here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/filter_keywords ) . 
  would n't work . 
  the start of these `` trends '' ususally is organic . 
  one user comes up with something nobody had thought of before ( `` kettle of europe '' ) and people hop on the train as that post get traction . 
  this would n't work in a vote . 
  it would also be a lot of work for us mods . 
  megathreads rarely lead to good discussion . 
  we are already running into sticky problems as there are only two slots . 
  i am also a mod of / r/de . 
  here 's why this wo n't work on / r/europe : 1 .
