  we are already pretty strict on non-european content . 
  we do not have posts about cofefe or stupid stuff trump does in america ( unless it directly affects europe ) . 
  we do not really have runs for / r/all on / r/europe . 
  we end up on / r/all sometimes , but those are rarely the `` x of europe '' posts . 
  the problem is a different one and the setup of the respective subreddits is different . 
  we do not have a problem with these posts either . 
  we just have a problem with them flooding our subreddit . 
  when 70 % of our front page consists of posts of this kind , something is wrong and needs to be fixed . 
  even though i might sound out of touch with the community now : what the users `` want '' is n't always what 's best for the sub . 
  clickbait headlines tend to get more upvotes than high-quality journalism . 
  pictures tend to get more upvotes than high-quality text posts . 
  it 's not that simplistic . 
  we acknowledge that people like these posts and we do not want to get rid of them , but it appears that the community is unable to keep these trends in control . 
  very few of these trends have actually been shut down by the community through voting . 
  as i have said multiple times - we do not plan to get rid of these threads completely . 
  it 's just that it was too much yesterday .

  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because all `` x of europe '' are banned for the current 24 hours . 
  please check [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6n4n2e/no_more_x_of_europe_posts_for_the_next_24h_is/ ) for more information . 
  not really , no . 
  it just says that `` these are the rules at this place - like it or leave '' . 
  that 's nothing about `` superiority '' . 
  i can make guests obey the rules in my house even if i think that their way of going along may be `` superior '' . 
  my house , my rules .

  i have explicitly stated in the thread that we also remove posts from the previous hours . 
  does n't work . 
  we only have two sticky slots and we need both sometimes . 
  it would also be a giant mess of a thread that would equate banning this stuff completely . 
  i am aware of that , thank you . 
  by that comment , i simply wanted to say that i consider it unlike that even two countries are up for joining together right now . 
   when it 's gon na get tiring people will just stop upvoting it . 
  like 70 % of our front page is covered by these posts . 
  we get complaints from users in the threads and via modmail . 
  trends of this kind go for days sometimes if we do n't do anything about it . 
  people do not `` stop upvoting them '' . 
  these trends keep on reoccuring . 
  i 'm sure / r/poland will be happy to house at least some of our trends  distribute the trends fairly amongst the national subreddits !, 
   i do n't want mod editorialisation or judgements thank you . 
  i would ask you to try any subreddit that does n't moderate its content . 
  i can tell you from experience that it does n't work . 
  subreddits of that kind turn into shit * very * quickly . 
  hands-off moderation and letting the votes decide is pretty much [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/gmyv13avmfs?t=2s ) . 
  i do n't even think that a federal europe with two countries is realistic at the moment . 
  you do n't . 
  you simply need a stance whether a culture is in compliance with your laws and customs . 
  which is actually a pretty neutral assessment .

  you do realize why this does n't work without a federal europe , do n't you ? 
  this would n't make sense if that person was n't able to dictate stuff to the national states , which would simply remove their souvereignty . 
  check the post on the front page . 
  the `` low quality '' was merely a substitute reason . 
  the current removal message for posts of this kind reads this way :  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because all `` x of europe '' are banned for the current 24 hours .

  reddit is a bit flawed in this regard unfortunately . 
  nah , its just the removal reason i used here for convenience . 
  please check the stickied post on the front page .

   fwiw , i think quite a few people are just as annoyed by the endless echo-chambers regarding `` the immigrant apocalypse incoming hide yo wife hide yo children , is n't islam the worst , look at what erdocrazy said today , president twitterbot does n't get the eu does he , is eu actually a merkelreich , who is and is n't a putinbot , breakfast means breakfast , more g\u00f6tterfunken ?? '', 
  and so on . 
  if you spend a month or so on the sub , you 'll know all the arguments by heart . 
  that 's not something we can or should change though . 
  we as mods should not aim to remove content of certain political leanings ( as long as it does n't turn into hate speech or similar stuff ) and it is also not `` fair '' to cut off posts about a certain topic ( e.g. 
  immigration ) after a while . 
  we try our best to remove duplicate posts on similar issues , but that 's about it . 
  `` x of europe '' posts are usually not that political and people can not accuse us of not being impartial when removing them ( does n't prevent some people from doing so though ) . 
   do n't get me wrong , there has been an unmanageable shitposty increase in `` x of europe '' in the last few days , but ... such threads often give interesting information . 
  like examples of what the national cuisine of iceland is , discussion about that . 
  i do not disagree with you . 
  and as i have stated elsewhere , we do not want to get rid of these threads altogether . 
  if we wanted that , we would have banned them completely months ago . 
  it 's just too much right now .
