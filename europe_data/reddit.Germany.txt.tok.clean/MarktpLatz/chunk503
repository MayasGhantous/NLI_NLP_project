  for now , we will just wait and see how it goes .

  actually that 's wrong . 
  while i do not believe in this kind of `` multiculturalistic approach '' , it is very much possible to exclude hateful ideologies in such an approach .

   and what happens after 24 hours ? 
  we will see . 
  we will be ready to react accordingly . 
  maybe people will chill out a bit . 
  we are still working on a ruleset that does n't kill these posts completely while preventing them from flooding our subreddit . 
   some of these `` x of europe '' posts were not that bad . 
  sure , no objection there . 
   the only way to solve this problem is not to upvote those posts for a long time . 
  that 's not within our ( mod team ) control . 
  if the users do not do this ( which they are n't so far ) , we have to find other solutions . 
  i 'm gon na quote my other reply :  we do not want to get rid of this content completely . 
  we do not want to turn into a subreddit that is purely about politics and news . 
  a lighthearted post ( even a series ) is totally fine as long as people do n't over-do it . 
  there are / r/casualeurope and / r/europics . 
  however , we do not want to get rid of this content completely .

  these trends keep on occuring . 
  they have been for the last year , i do not see why that would change . 
  and i also do not want the subreddit to go to shit before something happens . 
  it is not because `` i personally dislike it '' , this was n't a decision that was taken just by me . 
  and no , upvotes are not an indicator of what should be allowed on this sub and what not . 
  clickbait headlines tend to be more upvoted than high quality articles . 
  sorry , but it just is too much right now . 
  all these posts are essentially `` low quality '' . 
  it is just that we tolerate them most of the time . 
  right now , it just is too much . 
  all other recent posts of this kind have been removed as well . 
  see stickied post on the front page .

  i do n't speak romanian unfortunately . 
  could anyone who does tell me whether this is accurate ? 
  any reliable sources backing this `` fun fact '' ? 
  and no , that 's an us internal issue . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is a question better suited for / r/askeurope .
