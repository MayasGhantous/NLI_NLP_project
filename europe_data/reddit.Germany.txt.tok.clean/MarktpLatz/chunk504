   the department of culture . 
  sounds about right . 
  the department of culture of hamburg recently paid 85,000 $ to paint the wall of a residential house in ( real ) gold .

  if they fulfill our criteria , sure . 
  at this point , this seems rather unlikely though .

  it would still be positive , just to a lesser degree . 
  mainly caused by strong levels of legal migration . 
  tja ... 
  props to the uk though . 
  oxfam calculated what a `` fair share '' would be when it comes es to spending in the region .

  our main problem is that we only have two sticky slots : /, 
  you are correct , i made a small mistake . 
  i accidentally sorted by `` rising '' instead of `` new '' and thought you posted after the megathread . 
  apologies , reinstated . 
  probably not much . 
  it just further confirms the assumption that the party is disunited and in part governmed by extreme right-wingers . 
  they have suffered badly in the polls , they are mostly estimated to be between 6.5-7 % ( there is also a poll saying 9 ) . 
  what 's more threatening for them is that they might not be allow to run in germany 's fourth most populous state . 
  either exactly that way or `` kemal kilicdaroglu '' .

  in this case , we would have seen coverage by swedish and international media pretty quickly . 
  yeah , but this is n't the appropriate place . 
  for questions about europe , we like to refer users to / r/askeurope or , even better , to the national subreddits .

  this is a ) not happening and b ) nonsense . 
  claiming that not supporting the assad regime is something minor as disagreement with a political party is just ridiculous . 
  in general , sure . 
  once syria is safe , this is the destination they should return to . 
  but it simply is n't safe at the moment .

  that was from turkey . 
  there is a different standard when it comes to deportations from europe . 
  if it was a more widespread phenomen , it would require us to reevaluate our position , but given the amount of syrian refugees outside syria , 100,000 is n't really a lot and not indicative of anything . 
  i 'd simply like a number directly from the police . 
  usually the police estimation is lower end and the organizers upper end . 
  the reality is somewhere in the middle . 
   i 'm from berlin and do n't disagree . 
  i at least knew that you were from germany :p  but we 've also tried to push quotas on people sure , that was a giant mistake that has done a lot of harm to inner-eu relations . 
   and the famous merkel misunderstanding that made it around the world has made things more difficult than they needed to be too . 
  i still maintain that the press bears a good chunk of the responsibility here . 
  the international press made big headlines with the `` wir schaffen das '' but ignored the rest of the press conference and they basically ignored a correction published by our governments a few days later about misconceptions in the public and the media . 
  and then , people should n't overestimate the impact of that sentence . 
   i do n't at all think that a solution and coming to an agreement is impossible . 
  both sides want the same thing and have the same interests in the end . 
  but there 's only one way of getting there , and pushing for quotas has never been along that path . 
  there was never a time where going for quotas made a solution more attainable . 
  which is why it really pisses me off . 
  i think there are certain conditions that need to be fulfilled before a quota solution becomes viable . 
  and germany is n't really in the position to complain here either - we rejected a quota rejected by the italians early in the last decade as well . 
  i think one part of the solution propagated by eastern european countries is in fact part of an actual solution . 
  namely spending money in the region so that people do not come here in the first place . 
  it has been reported that many people only started making their way to europe because the supplies in their camps started to run low and because the conditions there were completely horrible . 
  so much for the theoretical side of it . 
  but what pisses me off about it is that the eastern european countries ( and i qualify everything east of germany as `` eastern '' ) have talked a lot but did very little . 
  especially when it comes to spending money in the region . 
  the amounts pledged by our eastern neighbors have been embarassing . 
  truely embarassing , and that also limits my empathy for them complaining about the troubles in europe . 
  you do n't want refugees ? 
  well sure , but please try to work on a solution and actually do some stuff instead of just sitting on the side and complaining about everything we do . 
  merkel 's actions were n't optimal , but no other country could even offer a viable alternative to our proposal . 
  no country was willing to provide leadership , everyone just said what * could n't * be done . 
  and no , before people call hungary 's actions a solution : unilateral action ( building fences ) can never be a solution . 
  a solution has to bring everyone to the table so nobody will get fucked or harmed in the end . 
   but our asylum policies are n't the only thing that our politicians can affect . 
  honestly , germany has been one of the most active countries in trying to do things `` outside germany '' . 
  merkel has travelled key countries in africa trying to negotiate in this regard and , unlike many other countries , we have actually sent a lot of money to the camps in the region . 
  sure , we could have done more in this regard , but it also is time for other countries to step up . 
   sharing the burden is never going to fly , ever .
