  was n't my intention . 
  hence why i wrote `` compulsory military service for a murderous regime '' . 
   that should change in my opinion , i would have no problems deporting criminals to the us even if they might face capital punishment . 
  well i do , and it also wo n't change . 
  well , feel free to provide evidence for the first part . 
  do n't bother about the `` street part '' as op explicitly excluded those . 
  that flair is very much accetable as it is in line with what international media reports . 
  [ france24 : crowd estimates range from over 200,000 to 1.5 million ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20170708-turkey-braces-justice-march-finale-istanbul-erdogan ) [ spiegel : more than 100,000 , organizers say `` up to two millions '' ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/istanbul-zehntausende-feiern-protestmarsch-von-kilicdaroglu-a-1156903.html ) [ bbc : tens of thousands ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40547972 ) [ businessinsider/associated press : hundreds of thousands ] ( http://www.businessinsider.de/turkey-main-opposition-leader-to-end-march-for-justice-with-a-rally-2017-7?r=us&amp;ir=t ) [ hurriyet daily news : hundreds of thousands ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/justice-rally-marks-new-beginning-turkeys-main-opposition-leader-says-.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=115302&amp;newscatid=339 ) [ wapo : hundreds of thousands , party officials say `` over a million '' ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/turkish-opposition-leaders-25-day-march-to-end-with-rally/2017/07/09/e93ce6ee-649d-11e7-94ab-5b1f0ff459df_story.html ), 
  i have n't seen this number in any credible source so far . 
  mind to provide one ? 
   denmark technically has compulsory military service and countries like finland and estonia actually enforces this quite strictly . 
  there is a significant difference between denmark , finland or any other democratic country in the world and the fucking assad regime . 
   plenty of countries use turture or imprisonment after a `` mock '' trial so syria is n't that much of a special case . 
  we do not deport into countries where people face torture or the death penality . 
  therefore , we do not deport criminals to the us unless they guarantee that they will not be executued . 
  major disagreement here . 
  compulsory military service for a murderous regime and imprisonment as well as torture on innocent people pretty much prevent us from doing so in the current situtation . 
  no fighting does n't mean that a territory is `` safe '' . 
  nobody is stealing anything from anybody . 
  the state can spend your money for stuff it considers appropriate , even if you do n't like it . 
  you have zero say in how the state should spend `` your '' money . 
  all you can do is vote in some other party promising to handle it differently . 
  but not a single party here , not even the afd is suggesting to stop paying benefits to refugees . 
  asylum is an institute born out necessity in the past . 
  there are pretty basic defitions what constitutes a state - the most basic requriements being a state territory , people living in that state and state authority . 
  some people also argue that a state needs some kind of constitution ( does n't need to be written ) and that it is needs to be recognized by other states . 
  that 's essentially what a state is . 
  the way a state is run is something entirely different . 
  it is possible that a government takes decisions that only benefit a minority in the population while negatively affecting the rest of the population ( e.g. 
  protecting disabled people ) . 
  it is possible that a government spends money of the country on affairs somewhere else even though it might not yield immediate benefits for the citizens of said state . 
  there is n't a clear-cut definition how the government of a state needs to work . 
  even a autocratic regime working for the benefit of a very few while harming most of the people in a state is still a `` state '' .

  our states are not libertarian . 
  in fact , i am not aware of any purely libertarian country in the world . 
  you are grossly overestimating the impact of this . 
  and there is a * lot * more legislation than the refugee convention on this issue . 
  where is that written ? 
  by that definition , granting asylum to people and providing financial assistance to other countries as well as spending on humanitarian aid is violtating the `` core principle of a state '' . 
  that 's simply inaccurate . 
  the purpose of a state is n't defined that way . 
  you simply just made that up .

   once you do n't agree with economi migrants ( so called refugees ) you get : your post or comment removed . 
  why is your post still up then ? 
  we have no issues whatsoever with anti-immigration posts . 
  but language matters . 
  you are a brand new account and we usually do not explain removal reasons for comments unless someone gets banned . 
  you should really read up on how a democratic state works . 
  you do n't get to opt out of things you do n't like . 
  a person that has never been unemployed will still pay into social insurance . 
  you can not `` opt out '' of unemployment benefits to save cost . 
  it 's the same reason why the republian proposal for health care is shitty .

  if you ever saw what else gets removed ( this includes stuff that you would probably describe as `` left wing '' ) , you would n't talk that way . 
  that 's something you just made up . 
  the role of the government is n't limited to htat . 
  and apart from that - a vast majority of germans was in favour of taking in refugees . 
  does n't work that way . 
  the fact that there are still people in syria does n't make syria a good destination to send refugees back to . 
   like this ( or this , or this ) . 
  here 's the difference : your three example were light-hearted posts with no political message attached .

  you should probably look at the reality in libya . 
  the country has three different govenrments and local militias are governing certain areas . 
  additionally , you have the is remainders there . 
  this is n't a `` peaceful country '' . 
  and apart from that - libyans are only a very tiny fraction of the refugees .
