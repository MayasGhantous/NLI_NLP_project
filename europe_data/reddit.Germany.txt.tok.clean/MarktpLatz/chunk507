   insuring nations against flooding is great , but tackling the problem at its source is better . 
  the fact that there is a better option ( there are things that you can not prepare for though ) does n't make this any less good . 
  the track record of the uk on dealing with catastrophes on their own soil does n't really matter to this proposal . 
  whatsoever . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  please stay civil . 
  personal attacks are n't tolerated . 
  simply not the case . 
  the media is quite critical of these protesters .

   this is not validated until we get to merkel ( though it was getting heavily upvoted , mods removed it ) this is a lie . 
  [ his post for reference ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ltjfj/scumbags_of_europe_this_one_requires_no/ ) - it is on 0 upvotes , with 43 % of votes being positive . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fifaelurtao ), 
  and if they are 1 on 1 , they speak german or english as far as i know . 
  merkel has stated in the past that putin 's german is better than her russian because she is rusty as hell .

  does n't work . 
  we have tried this approach in the past , and almost every time it results in 80 % of the front page being covered in posts of the same series . 
  we had a lot of users telling us that they dislike that and therefore , we think it is necessary to stop these trends at some point . 
  about 20 people already did .

  nothing . 
  op is just trying really hard to somehow make this about merkel . 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  it being on the front page is a fact that i did n't just make up . 
  any other mod on this team would act the same way . 
  if you do not believe me , write a modmail . 
  honestly , no clue . 
  cars can start to burn quite quickly from what i have heared .
