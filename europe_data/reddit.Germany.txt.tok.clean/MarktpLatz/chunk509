  you should read up on this . 
  there were hundred thousands of refugees on the way to europe already when merkel said her first public word on it . 
  any claim that merkel somehow `` started '' the refugee flow is grossly inaccurate and totally ridiculous .

  sure . 
  the express , like any other british tabloid , is banned on this sub because they frequently publish misleading stories and often do not fulfill basic requirements of good journalism .

  not really . 
  we have a general policy that polls have to be cleared with the mod team first . 
  we especially dislike strawpolls as they are easily manipulated . 
  additionally , ops question was already answered in our last [ survey ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5rhzhp/the_results_are_in_1000000_subscriber_survey/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) .

  depends on the perspective . 
  in terms of economic prosperity alone , it is good , even for the eu countries . 
  politically however , it would n't be good for the eu . 
  does n't matter . 
  it 's like police pretending to buy drugs to get the dealer . 
  police can simply order an uber and fine everyone who offers their service to them .

   do you also worry about the supermarket being open ? 
  because it works absolutely fine without legislation ... you think supermarkets do not follow legislation ?

  please use direct links . 
   and trains do not run if there is low demand for certain hours ... that is just not the case in many places . 
  that 's scheduled however . 
  and they run on schedule , whether there are passengers or not . 
  it 's similar for taxis . 
  they might reduce the number of taxis available at less relevant times , but they will still be there . 
  this is n't necessarily the case for uber . 
  op simply asked how it is possible to `` ban uber '' .

  sure . 
  i was mainly talking about stuff in general . 
  of course , brexit should be dealt with first before anything else major can be started . 
  sure . 
  but discarding any action that might cause the markets to react is essentially doing harm to democracy . 
  it should be possible to reform and take decisions * against * the market , but people have to consider the market beforehand and take appropriate action . 
  you are comparing apples and oranges .

  yeah , but the solution for that is to lobby and push for removing or updating these laws , not bypassing them . 
  here 's the difference : the mentioned examples did not break any laws . 
  well , whatever , i 'll allow it . 
  well , can we let the economy dictate everything ? 
  i do n't think we should . 
   it moves according to price and demand . 
  that is how you allocate resources efficiently . 
  not if you want to provide public transportation . 
  imagine if trains would n't run if there was low demand in a specific hour . 
  it would n't work . 
   why would a taxi company be forced to be everywhere ? 
  not everywhere , but as long as there are taxis available in your city , they will actually take you .

  well , then tell me how they are `` fair competition '' . 
  as i have said , it is not fair to compete against uber in its current form .
