  you kill off the regular taxis with uber though , which means that the service wo n't be available anymore . 
  uber is undercutting regular taxis by disobeying laws , by running continuous losses funded by investors and by not paying taxes . 
  that 's not exactly a fair business model to go up against . 
   do you always ask if your friends if they has done health check ups , and if their car is working ? 
  i do n't see the difference , we already has driving licenses and control cars regularly . 
  this parallel does n't exist . 
  when your friends help you build something , they do not need to follow health and safety procedures either . 
  professionals often do . 
  there is a difference between professionals and `` regular people '' . 
   do you really think uber would n't transport all kind of passengers ? 
  uber is n't available everywhere all of the time and prices can skyrocket at certain times . 
  this does n't happen with regular taxis . 
  thanks for notifying us !, 
  it will get changed soon . 
  that 's not the point . 
  every country is free to decide however it wants on this . 
  labelling a survey makes it even worse as we do not allow them without prior mod approval . 
  if you want to ask europeans in general a question , use / r/askeurope . 
  if you have specific demands to the people of some countries , try the national subreddits . 
  you just made a point about their unions . 
   and opposite to uber , taxi drivers can do this ( via their unions , for example ) . 
  there is no major taxi driver union in germany . 
  their drivers here can vote exactly as much as uber drivers . 
   also , the gov ' t certainly does n't give a shit about us , customers , about the service quality , etc , etc. 
  honestly , i have always been quite pleased with the quality of taxi rides in germany . 
  sure , they are n't exactly cheap , but they do what they are required to do and they do not rip you off ( i assume that some do , but nobody has ever tried that with me ) . 
  in part , sure . 
  but some of them also make a lot of sense . 
  i like the fact that drivers need a basic qualifcation for the job , that they need to pass frequent health checks and that their cars are annually checked . 
  i also like that taxis are forced to transport passengers , no matter if they want it or not . 
  stuff like taxi licenses , as they are handled in parts of europe , are ridiculous of course . 
   maybe taxis have something to learn from uber . 
  nobody denies that uber does some things better than normal taxis . 
  this is not the point of concern . 
  the problem most countries have with uber is that they are circumventing laws and regulations while offering their services , putting those that obey these regulations ( mainly taxis and established chauffeur services ) at a disadvantage . 
  it can not be that those that follow the law get effectively punished . 
  uber is free to offer its services here if they comply with our laws and they are of course free to lobby for a change to these laws . 
  but unless anything is changed about them , they apply . 
   but well guess it 's time to say goodbye to nice cheap rides where you can know price beforehand and do n't need to carry money with you . 
  at least in germany , this is already possible in many areas . 
  you can simply fine the drivers for offering the services . 
  this quickly shuts down the business . 
  nobody is going to risk huge fines for a bit of cash . 
  that was mainly a symptom of our authorities being overwhelmed in 2015 and early 2016 . 
  it 's different now . 
  that 's not accurate . 
  the government clarified things about it , but the media did n't report it as much as the famous `` wir schaffen das '' . 
  in fact , it received little attention in the international media in general . 
   lots of them borrowed money to get to europe and they need to pay it back , '' said mekharena . 
  he himself paid people smugglers $ 3,000 . 
  benefits are not meant to pay back debt . 
  benefits are meant to ensure that you can afford the most basic things required for living . 
   once granted asylum , a refugee can travel freely within the eu and join friends and family in western europe that 's not really accurate . 
  people were already coming here , so merkels words were hardly an invitation that caused the movement in general . 
  wrong subreddit . 
  try one of the uk subs . 
  not about the content . 
  never was , the content is completely fine . 
  i disagree . 
  if i had seen it earlier , it would have stayed removed . 
  since there is a lot of activity however and since i am tired - whatever . 
  it 's not too major i guess . 
  fucking bentley piece of shit .
