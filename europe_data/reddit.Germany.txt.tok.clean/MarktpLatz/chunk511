  try / r/travel or / r/poland, 
  i would argue that it would make me ill-suited for this position if i felt insulted all the time . 
  there 's nothing wrong with a bit of banter . 
  i love you too < 3, 
  nobody ever claimed that this is a democracy . 
  it 's a technocracy , maybe in part a meritocracy . 
  but that 's good . 
  actually we can . 
  you should probably educate yourself on what freedom of speech means . 
  you are not serious , are you ? 
  not on this sub . 
  the other law has always been meant to be debated today . 
  this was set before anyone could even hope to vote on marriage equality today . 
  sorry , that 's just the german keyboard layout on my phone . 
  german quotation marks look that way . 
  it is fine to say that you think that homosexuals should n't be allowed to marry , what is n't fine is saying that homosexuals are \u201e degenerate `` or that homosexuality is a \u201e mental disability `` . 
   only a fraction of the mps were present in the bundestag and voted for it this does n't reduce the legitimacy of the law . 
   and if reddit has more then 2 million german users it will hit with this law too . 
  will be interested , considering some subs we have here ... . . 1 . 
  i doubt that figure of two million germans on reddit . 
  i doubt that reddit will be affected, 
  this comparison does n't even make sense . 
  the armenian genocide is n't connected to this law in any way . 
  given that the cdu did n't even want this vote , this is a ridiculous claim . 
   it 'd be one thing if the law were evenly applied -- it is n't do you have * any * evidence ( not anecdotal ) to back this claim up ? 
  i am pretty sure you do n't . 
  removed for editorialization . 
  please repost with the proper headline and a translation . 
  conservatives were in power for the last twelve years . 
  while the cdu mps were n't all opposed to it , they did not want to alienate their conservative voters . 
  calling out bs on something is n't \u201e an agenda `` . 
  yup . 
  spd + linke + greens have 320 votes . 
  so around 70 from cdu/cdu . 
  not yet , but it will eventually be published [ here ] ( http://www.bundestag.de/abstimmung ) . 
  well , we did so in the last decade . 
  an unsc seat and nuclear power were n't that relevant in eu affairs recently . 
  they wo n't arrest erdogan . 
  they would simply dissolve the rally . 
  protesters could be temporarily arrested for \u201e protesting `` despite the protest being illegal . 
  erdogan can move freely in germany . 
  should he attempt to hold a rally , this will be prevented by german police forces . 
  let 's say that we did n't have any demands from the content producers to halt that way of going along . 
  one could argue that it 's a legal grey area . 
  it 's not about the quality of the source , it is about the paywall . 
  our rules state that you need to paste the content in the comments if you post a paywalled article . 
  you are wrong , art . 
  5 applies to everyone , not only to germans . 
  foreign heads of state are n't protected however - unless they are acting as private citizens which erdogan is n't . 
  it being a basic human right means jackshit . 
  there is no international court that can enforce it . 
  what matters is that the german constitution guarantees that right . 
  and unlike what / u/zehferris said , our constitution actually grants this right to \u201e everybody `` . 
  there is one limitation - erdogan could claim this as a normal person , he can not claim fundamental rights in germany in his position as president of turkey . 
   i mean , i feel like many people and politicians are very much dissatisfied with german leadership within the eu due to the refugee crisis . 
  due to our size and poltical/economic power , it is n't really a question whether germany is leading the eu . 
  the only relevant question is whether we lead together with others or try to have it our way all the time . 
  one could make a good point that germany has been leading the eu for the last decade . 
  i think most people will agree with me that a leadership duo with france is better than germany leading alone . 
  this is also true for germany . 
   i mean , even germans and german politicians are fed up with ` her ' ideas and policies . 
  her popularity ratings are back where they were before the refugee crisis . 
  most germans are quite consent with her . 
  damn , i missed that . 
  fixed now . 
  sorry , what ? 
  old article , essentially tl ; dr translation :  the federal government will prohibit the planned appearance of president erdogan in front of his followers at the g20 summit in germany . 
  `` we are telling turkey that we are convinced that such an appearance is n't possible in germany . 
  we have court rulings from our constitutional court allowing us to decide that way '' , foreign minister sigmar gabriel said in moscow . 
  translation of the updated article :  the german government will ban a speech by turkish president erdogan at the g20 summit . 
  `` we are telling turkey that we are convinced that such an appearance in germany is not possible , '' said foreign minister gabriel . 
   the federal government has quickly found a clear line : there should be no appearance of the turkish president erdogan in germany , according to foreign minister sigmar gabriel . 
  `` our country is an open country , but we have no intention of carrying the domestic conflicts into our population - and for us , the turks are part of our society , '' said the spd politician . 
   `` we are telling turkey that we are convinced that such an appearance in germany is not possible . 
  there is constitutional jurisprudence that we can prohibit this , '' gabriel said during a state visit to moscow . 
   in view of the current conflicts between germany and turkey , he believes that a performance by erdogan is not appropriate . 
  this position was coordinated with chancellor angela merkel . 
  the federal government wants to act on the matter of appearances of foreign politicians in germany in general and not just tell `` no '' to erdogan . 
   `` we will take a step further , '' gabriel said , adding : `` i have proposed to the chancellor that appearances of foreign politicians in germany in general should be reevaluated . '', 
  specifically , all appearances of foreign politicians should be prohibited three months before an election . 
  representatives from eu countries are excluded from this . 
   erdogans appearance in germany was also rejected by the leader of the linke parliamentary group , sahra wagenknecht . 
  `` it is unacceptable that erdogan '' , says wagenknecht , `` is campaigning for a regime that does not respect human rights '' . 
  csu general secretary andreas scheuer emphasized : `` german soil is n't the pace for turkish domestic policy . 
  erdogan must be prevented from appearing '' . 
   the umbrella organization of the turkish community in germany also rejects the appearance of erdogan . 
  erdogan had a negative impact on the relationship with germany , among other things , through his nazi comparisons , says the federal chairman g\u00f6kay sofuoglu,
