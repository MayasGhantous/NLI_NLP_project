  if you go to the police and report him for doing or being whatever and international media starts to pick it up , fair enough . 
  otherwise , clear no .

  it was n't even me who approved this submission . 
  again , you can ask a radom mod from this team and they will tell you that it is n't local news . 
  i have nothing against polish people by the way . 
  so , approving this article is `` speculation '' now ? 
  i simply said that there are two diverging accounts of what happened . 
   i do n't think wirtualna polska and fakt24.pl are considered credible sources at all . 
  can not comment on that . 
   most respected newspapers in germany as you might see , the zeit does n't only rely on these sources , it also used a ( very credible ) german source . 
   that is why multiculturalism should have its limits ( at least in poland ) . 
  it is not great to have teenagers inside burqa like costumes in name of freedom . 
  that 's not multiculturalism , that 's plain freedom of religion . 
  mentioning muliculturalism in a context of * visitors * does n't make any sense . 
   and , by the way being anti-muslim does n't make anyone racist at all . 
  call it whatever you want , it does n't really make you a good human being . 
  i will not engage in any speculation here . 
  let 's see what comes from it . 
  it 's up to the media to determine the credibility of their allegations , i can not comment on that . 
  what i do know is that some of the most respected newspapers in germany , from different political leanings , reported this . 
  the german media outlets did n't get this from polish media . 
  these girls reported this first hand to german media . 
  i can not determine that . 
  so far , it is the claim of the students vs. the claim of the police . 
  we as mods do not determine which side is right . 
  let 's see whether one side can provide evidence to the public . 
  even if it turns out to be fake , like the police claims , it would be a long stretch to assume something of this kind . 
  actually , no , it 's totally ridiculous . 
  you are n't seriously claiming that this is an eu conspiracy to make poland look bad as a punishment for political disputes , are you ? 
   they even included some details on holocaust it 's not like they made that up . 
  the students were on a class trip about the holocaust . 
  as i have said , this allegation is pointless because the whole mod team would decide this way on this . 
  our modding is pretty consistent in this regard - whatever you might want to claim . 
  i do n't even know what you are trying to argue about here . 
  this does n't change anything about the nature of this submission . 
  why should a muslim that attends school in germany have a worse knowledge of english than their christian or atheist counterparts ? 
  not really , no . 
  the mod team is pretty united on issues like this . 
  i can assure you that none of our mods would classify this as `` local crime '' . 
   local crime news ** with no international or political significance ** will be removed this does . 
  you still do n't get what i am saying . 
  but whatever , no point discussing this . 
   this is local crime post and should be treated as such . 
  it is n't . 
  when every major german newspaper , polish media * and * the bbc report about it , this is hardly a crime with limited regional relevance . 
  you do n't get what i am saying . 
  i do not contest that rule 3 is broken here , hence it is removed . 
  the post has been removed for editorialization . 
  what 's you rissue ? 
  op made a conclusion about the title which you said is wrong - well , the title does n't say anything that is n't written in the text . 
  so i do not contest that the title is editorialized . 
  [ previous thread about this issue that got removed for editorialization ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6js7xz/german_students_insulted_and_spit_in_the_face/ ), 
  while not the original title , the title is an accurate representation of the content of the article .
