  sure . 
  yeah , it just removes one topic from the election campaign . 
  which is in fact bad for schulz . 
   stuck with a conservative politician since ' 05 . 
  i would argue that it is more her party than her . 
  merkel never felt strongly about this . 
  she just knew that it had the potential to alienate conservative voters .

  vw operates a number of factories all over europe , increasing the size of one of these factories is n't as expensive as building a new one . 
  but yeah , you kind of have a point in this regard . 
  this may become more relevant for the future though . 
  when it comes to the decisions where new models are produced , everything is open again , especially when these new cars require a new production line anyways .

  there are more things that you have to factor into this . 
  most of the r&d is in germany and our system of corporate governance in germany ensures that the factories here are protected ( most car companies have 50 % labour union guys on the directorate board . 
  this protection is n't really there for factories outside germany , production locations are interchangeable as long as there are other countries with similarly skilled workers and lower wages .

  it 's a balance act . 
  it stops being fincancially sound for vw to produce in slovakia if the pay rises catapult the wage levels above the levels of certain other countries .

  yes , it was caught in the automod queue and set up for manual approval . 
  however , you left out a part of the headline , hence i removed it for editorialization .

   and they do n't exactly have the best track record insofar as meeting treaty mandated military spending requirements ... that 's just plain wrong . 
  the 2 % never was mandatory , it was a goal . 
  even now , there is n't 2 % , there is a commitment to work towards 2 % within the next couple of years . 
  germany is n't breaching any treaties by not spending 2 % right now . 
  and apart from that - germany continuously spent significantly more than 2 % throughout the cold war .

  that 's not exactly fair - without the reforms , the situation could be even worse . 
  because a collapsing system is significantly worse than a system where the pensions are low . 
  and yes , you can blame the cdu , they are aware of the problem yet did not fix it in 12 years of being in government .

   do you prefer r/news or r/worldnews ? 
  i am subscribed to / r/worldnews , but i rarely browse there . 
  i do not read / r/news . 
   also what steps do you take to stop other mods from over exercising their power to enforce their political agenda/ideology ? 
  bans are object to ban reviews by the team . 
  the mod who issued the ban is asked about it , but he only has one vote in the final decision . 
  most decisions on ban reviews are unanimous though . 
  bans on sources are thoroughly discussed and then voted on by the whole team . 
  the rules are relatively specific in many areas to prevent mods from being able to interpret them too freely .
