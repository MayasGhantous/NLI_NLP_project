   people should have the chance to read bad journalism/fake news too , when they want . 
  disagree . 
  people who are not familiar with these sites might fall for some of that shit and there 's nothing really lost by banning it . 
  the low quality of their articles and headlines also lowers the quality of the discourse . 
  the daily mail is banned . 
  the independent is currently being evaluated by the team . 
  the telegraph is still a good source , despite them running shitty headlines at times .

  removing the equivalent of 50 $ is just ridiculous .

   i do n't understand why people protest against deportations if that 's the law of the country ? 
  people are free to protest against everything . 
  whether you disagree with deporting people to afghanistan or not , protesting existing laws is a fundamental right of the people . 
  we are not til , also editorialization and old news article .

  kohl did n't really like merkel anymore because she was somewhat responsible that he had to resign as cdu leader . 
   she is widely considered a gold-digger . 
  i think that 's the wrong term . 
  kohl-digger would fit it better , she has been a long time `` fan '' of his .

  always depends where you are . 
  some parts really are n't that nice . 
  frankfurt is already the drug capital of germany . 
  excellent conditions i 'd say . 
  i think it 's pretty likely that they wo n't even get that .
