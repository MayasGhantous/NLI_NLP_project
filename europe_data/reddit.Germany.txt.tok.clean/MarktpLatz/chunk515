  that 's not really correct . 
  there were refugee streams for years . 
  boat refugees from northern africa have been a problem since the beginning of the last decade . 
   how do you explain all the moroccans in cologne ? 
  if you get a low number of moroccans every year , you will eventually have `` enough '' for that . 
   how can you verify where these people are from if they have no documents , speak the same language and have an incentive to lie ? 
  again , it is possible to differenciate people by accent . 
  you would be able to differenciate a saxonian from a guy from hamburg , the differences are significantly bigger between syria and morocco . 
   syrians and moroccans speak the same language !, 
  vastly different accent though . 
  `` geborene '' the full thing would read : `` mustermann , geborene gabler '' literal translation : `` mustermann , born gabler '', 
  it means that her birth name was `` gabler '' . 
  her current name ( through marriage ) is `` mustermann '' .

  removed . 
  you can check the last subreddits survey for the origin of our users . 
  to answer your question : yeah we have quite a few non-europeans . 
  mister , i am pretty certain that i have spent more time reading about the greek crisis than you , from various sides , mainly non-german sources and even from varoufakis himself . 
  do n't make claims you have no way of backing . 
  neither is the case , mister one day old account . 
  yup . 
  yesterday . 
  syriza didnt provide a realistic alternative to the proposals of the other countries . 
  even the other states suffering from the debt crisis went against greece . 
  i do n't propose anything , i simply stand by the claim that varoufakis was an amateur that did harm to greece . 
  oh , i do n't expect that we will see our money back . 
  does n't make debt relief politically viable or varoufakis more competent . 
  ukraine is n't greece , ukraine is n't part of the euro zone , the situation is fundamentally different . 
  and no , politically viable is a reasonable explanation . 
  you simply could n't have sold an outright debt relief to northern european voters . 
  the same is true for most of his proposals in the modest proposal . 
  varoufakis did n't make any suggestions that were politically viable and his actions that i pointed out ( not prepared , no proposals , wrong style ) did not aid his cause and alienated his colleagues . 
  i do n't even see a claim of yours apart from `` that 's propaganda '' . 
  the modest proposal is n't being implemented . 
  and there is still a difference ( a major one ) of de-facto bankruptcy with loans from the ez and an actual bankruptcy . 
  that does n't change the fact that the anti-german rhetoric of the fn and other parts of the political system resonated with certain groups of voters . 
  not necessarily . 
  everyone in the euro group knows about the faults of the euro , it 's just that fixing these things is nearly impossible politically . 
  i think we have a pretty good clue about this . 
  you have zero evidence that the statistics are inaccurate , please do n't just speculate . 
  you do understand that you have nothing that actually disputes my claim ? 
  crying `` propaganda ! '', 
  when faced with facts that you dislike is n't really a viable argument if you ca n't back these claims up . 
  you 're starting to become ridiculous . 
  just look at the final statements of the eurogroup during the time where varoufakis was in office . 
  the figures for the last years look the same . 
  northern africa never has a large share . 
  we know where they are from due to language checks that are done if there are questions about their origin . 
  when syriza came into power , the time where portugal , ireland & spain were directly threatened by a greek bankruptcy were over . 
  germany was willing to let greece go bust . 
  tsipras and varoufakis played a game of chicken , but , as the former greek finance minister papakonstantinou put it very eloquently , `` you can not play a game of chicken if you are on a greek moped and there is a german truck coming the other way '' . 
  as i have already outlined above , the criticism was directed at a variety of issues . 
   about his lack of preparation . 
  about his inability to bring concrete proposals to the table . 
  about his style in which he appeared in the meetings . 
  these claims were made by people that owed sch\u00e4uble nothing . 
  there is zero evidence for your claim . 
  again , this does n't make varoufakis and his acting any better . 
  this is n't a discussion about greece euro membership , this is a discussion about varoufakis , no matter how much you try to get away from the issue . 
  this is completely irrelevant to varoufakis ' incompetence to be an effective finance minister . 
  [ berenberg bank ] ( https://www.berenberg.de/uploads/tx_news/economics_12-2015_31_cow.pdf ) estimates that varoufakis has cost greece 7 % of gdp . 
  it has actually been confirmed by various participants of those meetings . 
  and as i said , the final agreeements were taken 17-1 . 
  these claims were shared by finance ministers of various countries . 
  the alternative to what he did was steering his country into certain bankruptcy . 
  varoufakis was an amateur whose tenure as finance minister did great harm to greece . 
  it really speaks volumes that he managed to unite a very diverse group ( the eurogroup ) , where many countries had a more favourable opinion of greece than the german representatives , against him . 
  several finance ministers expressed that they were pissed about him . 
  about his lack of preparation . 
  about his inability to bring concrete proposals to the table . 
  about his style in which he appeared in the meetings . 
  that 's not what you said previously . 
  you said `` a lot of moroccans '' . 
  and even if you want to include algeria and tunisia - we do not get a lot of refugees from any of the northern african countries . 
  their share is so low that the are n't even listed in the monthly reports from our government : [ page 8 ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl-mai-2017.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) ( in german ) . 
  they are part of the `` other '' group which means that their share is 2 % or lower .
