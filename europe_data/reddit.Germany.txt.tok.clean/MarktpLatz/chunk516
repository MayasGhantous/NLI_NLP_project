   a lot of the `` refugees '' are young moroccan males , who are petty criminals and street kids . 
  `` a lot '' is simply wrong . 
  the share of maroccans is pretty low .

  accurate . 
  it 's just a formality . 
  the actual owner is of course the federal republic , being the legal successor of the reich .

  the bundestag is the parliament , the building in which the parliament resides is still called the `` reichstag '' . 
  the formal owner of the building is , to this day , the * german reich * , by the way . 
  i do n't exactly know . 
  it at least dates back several decades . 
  even in france , people fall for the `` germany is too powerful and seeks to impose its way of life on europe '' mantra . 
  i would n't say that this is n't a widespread sentiment . 
  you are probably correct about young people , but they do not control the countries . 
  while that 's true , the old saying remains relevant : germany is too big for europe and too small for the world . 
  given the uks departure and france 's weakness more so than ever . 
   any policy which germany ` pushes ' will be resisted by many ( regardless of contents ) . 
  even without ww2 , this would happen because people are afraid of `` german hegemony '' . 
   this joint venture is called kant . 
  the project was called kant , they are now called knds . 
  since around nine months ago i think . 
  was n't approved . 
  should be visible now . 
  sure , thanks !, 
   if you were an actual homosexual you were exempted from the military service , are you refuting this ? 
  as i said , this was true in the early decades of military service here , but it has n't been the case for quite a while now , long before conscription was ended . 
  how is that even remotely relevant to what i just said ? 
  no personal attacks on other people please , not for their nationality , not for their words . 
  this article is from fucking 2012 .

   i even know germans who lied about their sexuality to avoid conscription when it was there . 
  this has n't been a reason not to serve for quite a long time .

  you are giving credit to the us for doing something that was n't even their focus . 
  that 's nothing about `` reliability '' here and the sanctions are also not enacted because of polish interests or because of anything related to poland . 
  this is simply retaliation against russia for interference in the us election . 
  that anolgy does n't really work . 
  we have no indicators that could make us believe that russia wo n't fulfill its obligations in the future . 
  it is just about the reliability of russias gas deliveries to germany . 
  and there is no point for concerns . 
  i know that this is different in other countries .
