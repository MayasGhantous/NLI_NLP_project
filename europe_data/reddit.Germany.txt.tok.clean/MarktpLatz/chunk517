  does n't change the fact that said countries ( and the ) eu have spoken out against it . 
  you make it sound like erdogan personally ordered this . 
  government more negative towards russia i 'd say ? 
  -- ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ guess ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ see ^ ^ ^ where ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ going . 
  i think most people would have lost interest in brexit after the third round . 
  `` even more voting ? 
  fuck it , we are staying ! '', 
  given that they have a long history of doing that , i believe even prior to the accession of the eastern countries to the eu , i do n't think so . 
  the 2009 dispute did n't really affect us . 
  yup , we do . 
  but not because we dislike poland , but because we think it would just provoke a pointless arms race that could send us into cold war 2.0 . 
   did you ever wandered why germany pays much less than poland ? 
  ( hint : it 's not because of your cuteness ) . 
  long-standing gas relationship between germany and russia , higher volume of purchases , more powerful country , did n't `` break away '' from russia ( as a whole country ) . 
   the eu under barroso did negotiate to bring ukraine into trading association with the rest of the eu , which kicked off the series of later events . 
  it is with the expectation of the eu working with ukraine that ukraine decided to associate with the eu . 
  obviously , this is not an unlimited credit card ( `` you did something ukraine does n't like !, 
  '' ) , but nord stream 2 is pretty significant wrt ukraine 's viability at the moment . 
  fair point , but that 's a bit abstract . 
   ukraine is under financial stress . 
  i think that there 's a reasonable argument that ukraine is probably likely to need support , if anything -- not to have her financial situation weakened further . 
  this is a very weak argument in my opinion . 
  `` you need to give country x free money because they rely on it '' . 
  you could make this point about every euro of money we pay to any other country . 
   poland is also affected , not just ukraine . 
  while germany has no legal obligation not to implement nord stream 2 because of poland , i would argue that it would be advantageous for eu members to generally not do things with security implications for other members . 
  that 's why it is proposed to equip the eastern european pipelines to change the flow direction . 
  it would ensure that eastern europe coult not get cut off their gas supply by russia . 
   above-and-beyond this particular arrangement , there 's signalling to the eastern members . 
  some of why the eu is desireable to eastern members is the security guarantees it provides . 
  for that to be credible , the eu members in the west would need to establish a reputation of being willing to make decisions that support security concerns in the east . 
  see above . 
   i agree on the `` one price '' thing , but it seems that if `` one price '' as well as nord stream 2 is required , that germany continues to not trust ukraine -- but moving forward , building trust would be something that presumably both have an interest in doing . 
  is there no guarantee that ukraine could provide that you 'd see as convincing to germany ? 
  as long as the russia-ukraine situation continues to be that volatile , there is nothing that could be convincing in my opinion . 
  the gas disputes wo n't end until ukraine becomes a prospering , rich country . 
  and even then , this could continue . 
  if you look at ukraine right now , `` prospering and rich '' seems a century away . 
  and most likely , a `` one price '' agreement would only apply to the eu and not to ukraine . 
  the difference is eu soil and not eu soil . 
  if you want to call that sematics - yes . 
   would you say that the main concern is the potential of future cutoffs , or germany having to pay transit fees to eastern europe ? 
  i would argue that both are valid reasons for us to build ns2 . 
   supposing that poland and ukraine could provide germany with credible guarantees that they would not cut off gas transit guarantees of this kind are worth shit if you are facing gas shortage in your own country . 
  i do not blame ukraine for taking gas from the supplies meant for germany after being cut off by russia . 
  there 's also nothing we can do about that . 
  it 's ukrainian soil . 
   and that transit fees would not exceed a certain amount from a fiscal perspective , this doesnt make any sense . 
  why would we pay transit fees if we could * not * play transit fees ? 
   and germany could provide credible guarantees that the eu would require that ukraine and all eu members have the same price and availability -- that is , the eu would purchase gas as a bloc . 
  honestly , i would like that , however my government unfortunately seems to think otherwise . 
  additionally , this is problematic for ukraine - they have recieved discounts on gas for a long time and lifting this to market prices has repeatedly been a point of concern for them . 
  i do not know how the price situation is at the moment . 
   how can you know if there is no final decision because the language on this is relatively clear . 
  pipelines on european soil need to be open for everyone and they must not be majorly owned by the russians . 
  south stream would n't be open and gazprom held a majority share . 
  now , ns2 violates some of this as well , but it is n't on european soil , hence these laws do n't apply . 
  the diversification of energy sources is a goal that can not be enforced by the eu . 
  i would argue that there is no connection to be made here . 
  apples and oranges . 
  not the case . 
  you have always paid more for gas than us , even before ns . 
  germany was * supporting * south stream . 
  this is pretty much a non-argument . 
   you show tremendous solidarity to a country 3000 km away which country are you talking about ? 
  the reason is irrelevant in the end . 
  what matters is that it would have been in violation of eu law no matter what while ns2 is n't violating these laws . 
  also missing the point . 
  the reliability is about continuous gas delivery . 
  should ns2 be built eventually , i see no reasons to doubt that russia will fulfill its delivery contracts connected with it . 
  it 's a neutral legal fact . 
  not the point . 
  the whole point here is that your initial argument ( russia is unreliable on gas ) is plain wrong . 
  if you exclude gas , we have significantly more in common with poland than with russia . 
  ukraine is a bit of complicated case since there are a lot of things that are wrong with ukraine .
