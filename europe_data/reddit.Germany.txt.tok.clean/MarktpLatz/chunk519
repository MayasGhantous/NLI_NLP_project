  it is possible for the commission to be opposed to ns2 and dislike the us senate action at the same time . 
   a spokesperson of the commission stated that `` it is important that new measures [ sanctions ] are coordinated in cooperation between the international partners to ensure that they will actually have impact and to ensure that we are unified on the sanctions '' . 
  eu country . 
   the president of the european council donald tusk has said that nord stream 2 is not in the eu 's interests yes , i am sure . 
  a spokesperson of the commission stated that `` it is important that new measures [ sanctions ] are coordinated in cooperation between the international partners to ensure that they will actually have impact and to ensure that we are unified on the sanctions '' . 
   czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , poland , slovakia and romania , lithuania and croatia . 
  that 's why i wrote * mainly * . 
  the v4 are the most vocal with their ns2 opposition . 
  they are also the most impactful voices in this regard . 
   coincidentally , the countries complaining now are the same as where the following companies are from : gazprom , royal dutch shell , e.on ( now uniper ) , omv , and engie ( former gdf suez ) why should a country that is n't negatively affected complain ? 
  i do not want to open this discussion again , i already had one about this today/yesterday . 
  the only thing i am saying here is that this action has the potential to damage the relationship with germany , france , austria and other countries while it wo n't improve the relationship with eastern europe and the baltics . 
  because these countries are aware that the us did not enact this to aid their interest in killing off ns2 . 
  while this is true , this is unrelated to the comment of op . 
  the relationship between the us and several european countries will suffer from this while there wo n't really be an improvement for the relationship with eastern europe since helping them here was n't the intention of the sanctions . 
  for eastern europe , this is only a `` welcome side effect '' . 
  germany , austria , france , the eu commission and one more european country that i can not remember right now .

   do you actually believe that ? 
  because i really do n't . 
  it is simply not possible to create a body in the eu that wo n't be majorly impacted by germany precisely because germany just is major player in the eu . 
  now more than ever . 
  look at the ecb . 
  it is possible to create bodies that will actually act independently from the german government . 
   schultz was not russian-friendly because he was the head of the euro parliament . 
  now he is the head of the social democrats and those were always relatively pro-russian . 
  thus schultz will have to adjust his stance so that it resonates with spd voters and so that it is in line with the party attitude . 
  his name is schulz , not schultz  i disagree . 
  here is one of his statements after becoming the candidate of the spd : `` i want a constructive relationship with russia . 
  however , it appears to me that the problem in this regard is n't us , it is the government of the russian federation . 
  the sanctions can only be abolished if the minsk agreement is fully realized . '', 
  this is pretty much the same line that merkel is taking .

  several major european countries are participating in ns2 and several of those countries have already expressed their concern about this decision . 
  the only countries `` benefitting '' from this are those that have been opposed to nsii ( mainly the v4 ) , however this can not be attributed to the us as this was n't their intention .

  i think out of the last 10 mods we added , maybe four had modding experience . 
  additionally , as i stated above , we have more people that we consider good candidates for the future , and several of them do not mod anything currently . 
   oh come on , we all know who has the most influence in the eu . 
  i somewhat expected that response . 
  you would obviously need to make that an eu competence . 
  and it is possible to create a body to decide on that that is n't majorly impacted by germany 's stance . 
  independence is a thing . 
   schultz schulz is no russian-friendly politician . 
  he has been very critical of russia during his tenure as president of the european parliament and he has agreed with the sanctions on russia . 
   and yeah , russia is obliged to sent certain amount of gas to you which they would ... and that 's the point . 
  they could send enough to you and not enough to ee . 
  then you could revert some of it to us but that would mean that you would n't have enough for yourself . 
  it makes us more flexible in general . 
  russia is n't the only source of gas . 
  it 's all about the infrastructure . 
  we do not plan to transition away from gas . 
  the diversification is only about the sources of that gas . 
  it has been consistent for a while now . 
  we had no departures for a year . 
   i would personally rather have ukraine have the money , they need them more than us ukraine is n't even a direct ally of ours ( different for the ee countries ) and once more , we should not have to pay transit fees simply because they `` rely '' on it . 
   as for the right measures preventing ee from being in a more strategically vulnerable posititon - so you basically want ee to place our full trust in germany 's hands ? 
  we have to hope that germany will negotiate on our behalf and will accept a slightly higher price than you would get otherwise ? 
  we have to hope that germany will revert the gas to us if russia goes crazy ? 
  first of all , it would not be germany that would make the decisions in this regard , it would be the eu . 
  i am sure that it would be possible to transfer the decisions on reverted flow to the eu as well . 
   what if russia sends only enough of gas for you and not enough for , say , poland ? 
  are you going to send them some of your gas ? 
  i am pretty certain that russia is contractually obligated to deliver a certain amount of gas to us . 
  russia has never broken a contract with us and they can not really afford to do so . 
   there 's no way of making ns2 without leaving ee in a more vulnerable position . 
  ee will end up more dependent on both russia and germany . 
  i 'm not saying that germany and russia are on the same level of reliability , of course germany is much more reliable , but not on 100 % . 
  you are perfectly capable of screwing us over if it helps you . 
  you already have very strong influence over ee , i do n't want you to have even more . 
  thats why that would be transferred to the eu and not to germany . 
   that is an incredibly funny thing to say , as i can not read the post that was removed to judge its content . 
  i am not a mod , dude . 
  mod removals of posts only hide and de-list those posts . 
  we can not completely delete them . 
  if you commented on a post and that post later gets removed , you will still be able to see the comments ( including the removal note and the name of the mod who removed it ) . 
  you can still access deleted posts through other users ' profiles ( or through your own ) . 
   you are fully aware that the rest of us can not access moderator logs to determine whether you are acting impartially or not . 
  there is a certain set of mod actions that are public ( e.g. 
  removals ) and i am one of the most communicative mods when it comes to modding . 
   and you are as biased as russian trolls are i would politely disagree fundamentally . 
  i do have the ability to be self-critical and critical of german actions . 
  it 's just that on handling issues with eastern europe , i tend to agree with what my country does . 
  we post removal comments when we are removing posts for example . 
  you could tell if i was removing anti-german posts because i disagree with them . 
  well , i do n't do that .
