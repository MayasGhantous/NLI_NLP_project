  sorry , i removed it again . 
  we had exactly this yesterday : [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6hluy9/where_migrants_were_rescued_source_and_an_article/ ) . 
  a bit more low quality picture , but i guess you will agree that it is exactly the same content .

  i blame / u/loulan for that . 
  we are a meta sub ? 
  this is us-centric . 
   as for the consultations - well that 's nice but it does n't really make any difference when you just go ahead anyway . 
  it does make a difference . 
  especially when it comes to sanctions as it allows us to coordinate this with the americans and tell them how this might affect us . 
   sorry , it just seems to me that you 're not capable of looking at things objectively when your country is involved . 
  i 'm sorry you have this assumption . 
   us wants to sanction russia because russia intervened in their elections = bad because it hurts germany . 
  no , i say it 's bad because they have not consulted with us first . 
  as i have stated before , we do not say sanctions are always bad because they harm us . 
  germany is still standing by the sanctions on russia enacted after crimea even though they do severe harm to us . 
  we need everyone to be on the same page here . 
   germany wants ns2 even though it hurts ee = ok , it 's just a legit business project that helps our interests and it 's not our problem that it hurts ee interests . 
  i think it is important to separate the issues why eastern europe ( i know your country is vehemently opposed to being called `` eastern europe '' , but it just is a very convenient term to describe everything east of germany ) is opposed to it . 
  first of all - financial interests . 
  we have no obligation to continue paying transit fees to poland and them losing transit fees is n't really a viable reason for us to stop the project . 
  i guess you will agree with that . 
  i know that the transit fees are important for ukraine , but the security of our supply is significantly more important . 
  on the other side , we have what i consider legitimate concerns your countries have . 
  the threat of being cut off by russia and russia charging your countries significantly more than e.g. 
  germany . 
  i am fully in favour of having the eu negotiate the gas purchases for all countries at once to prevent russia from ripping off your countries , even if that means that we will pay slightly more than now . 
  for the threat of being cut off , i whole-heartedly support equipping the pipelines for reverted flow , so that we can use those pipelines to supply your countries with gas in case russia would try to play games . 
  i think this is n't a black-and-white szenario . 
  given the right measures , ns2 will have no negative strategic impact on eastern europe , it is possible to offset the negative consequences with the changes outlined above .

  i have never called russia an ally . 
  the ally i am talking about is germany ( and the other european countries affected ) . 
  we are all just human beings and we are not getting paid for this . 
  adding new mods will certainly reduce the problems , but it can always happen that nobody is here for a while . 
  i do n't have such a list at hand at the moment , but the most powerful nation in the mod team is belgium . 
  yes , even we have to struggle with brussels bureaucrats . 
  take back control !, 
  what i found a bit of sad and telling about the state of your elections at the moment is the comment of mook to hillary why they lost : `` our data was wrong '' . 
  they did n't think it was the candidate or wrong policy . 
  in my opinion , it is a perversion of democracy if you can lose or win an election because of your analytics ( while i disagree that this was the whole reason , it was obviously important enough to them to name it as the primary reason ) . 
  turning out special groups of people in important states to win the election simply is n't very democratic . 
  it feels a bit like the opposite of how democracy is supposed to work - instead of the voters choosing the leaders , the leaders try to choose their voters . 
  fair point . 
  there is a difference between a business project that might not be in the best interest of your allies and * sanctioning * your allies . 
  i 'm not gon na open a whole new discussion about ns2 here again . 
  but i 'll repeat what i said in the past : i can not take the opposition of countries to our east against ns2 serious when your countries were not opposed to south stream , which would have accomplished exactly the same . 
  the only difference is that some of your countries would have benfited there . 
  it upsets me that poland ( and some others ) try to use ukraine as an argument why ns2 is bad while they have proven that they could not care less about ukraine . 
  hungary even said in the past that the # 1 goal of such a pipeline was to circumvent ukraine . 
  this is hypocritical at best . 
  and additionally , even if you might disagree with me on ns2 - there were at least consultations with our allies before all of this happened . 
  nothing of this kind happened with the sanctions . 
   germany has protected its energy interest all through the so called sanctions on russia we do n't really have a possibility to do something else , do we ? 
  like it or not , germany is reliant on russian gas and switching to another source is n't that easy . 
  buying gas from russia has been done throughout the cold war as well and the flow had never been disrupted , even in times of crisis . 
   but this is more than just this topic . 
  you are an intelligent fellow , but you side on germany 's talking point no matter the topic , with fervor . 
  that 's simply not true . 
   i have nothing against you , it is just not right that you are a moderator considering the narrative you constantly push here . 
  i can separate between my own opinions and being a mod . 
  if you have any complaints about my actual modding , feel free to point it out . 
  i am pretty certain that i do not ban people or delete comments that i personally disagree with . 
  if you have nothing to point out in this regard , this allegation is kind of pointless . 
  even as a mod , i am entitled to be opinionated about certain topics . 
  here 's the difference : your government and parliament ( s ) are representing these companies , you are elected to do this . 
  the same happens in germany , we have also enacted sanctions that harmed our companies . 
  however , there is a significant difference : we coordinated these sanctions with our allies and we talked to these companies first . 
  i do n't disagree on that . 
  i just disagree with the `` installed '' . 
  sure , russia played a role . 
  but we need to `` give credit where its due '' - the main group of people responsible are american voters . 
  sorry , but that 's just a ridiculous claim that completely misses the reality . 
  you can not use eastern europes advantage as a justification for these sanctions * because that 's not the purpose of these sanctions * . 
  the us does n't want to sanction russia because ee interests are in danger or because it wants greater energy diversification in europe , they simply want to retaliate against russia for what happened in the american election . 
  you can not simply mix those things up . 
  i have never claimed something else . 
  however , there is no reason to act like trump did n't stand a chance without the interference . 
  this is not how any of this works . 
  excuse me for not wanting to be on the receiving end of sanctions from one of our allies . 
  it is n't like we are opposed to any sanctions that do harm to us ( we lost over 20 bn $ in annual trade due to the russia sanctions ) in general , but some talks between * allies * before doing such a thing would be great . 
  additionally , it is n't just germany , several other european nations take the same stance . 
   when has germany ever put another country 's interests ' first ? 
  it has n't . 
  that 's simply not true . 
   why should the us forgive russia for installing trump , just because it inconveniences germany ? 
  it should n't . 
  sorry , brah , but being a free sovereign country is a wee bit more important to us than german butthurt about $ $ $ . 
  russian interference or not , it was the american voters who `` installed '' trump .
