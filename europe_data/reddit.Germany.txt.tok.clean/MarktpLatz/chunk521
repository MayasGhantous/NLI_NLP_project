  sure , but this does n't justify harming your allies without consultations . 
  if you have no proper ways of retaliation - well , bad for you , but this is n't really a viable alternative . 
  again , they could have enacted/proposed sanctions that do not harm their allies . 
  saying that it could be modified later is n't really an excuse . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is that it is possible to enact sanctions that do not harm your allies . 
  it is possible to talk to your allies first .

   be that as it may , it still does n't show a serious effort at diversification . 
  looks more like doubling-down on the same current options . 
  it makes mentioning nuclear totally wrong however . 
  we mainly use gas to heat our homes directly . 
  pretty unrealistic with a party like the greens , happy to seize the public swing in opinion . 
  and i can not blame them for it , even though i disagree with the decision taken . 
   you deactivated/will decommission your nuclear reactors and are building an oil pipeline wth the russians . 
  that hardly screams diversification to me . 
  there is no such relation . 
  first of all , ns2 is a * gas * pipeline , not an oil pipeline . 
  secondly , we do not heat with electricity .

  germany is the center of the eu , polticially and economically . 
  given frances relative weakness at the moment and the uk leaving , there is no country to rival germany in the eu . 
  things that happen in the eu sometimes happen against the will of a country , but they very rarely happen against the will of germany . 
  smaller countries need to form alliances with other countries to get close to the amount of power germany wields and even then they are at a disadvantage because the negotiating position of five countries is worse than the position of the country that is as large as all five of them combined since they need to satisfy the needs of five groups while we only need to satisfy one group of people . 
  there was a survey amongst european governments a while back who they would call first in times of crisis - for most of them this country was germany . 
  what i found very telling is what the french representative said ( paraphrased ) : `` when we want to start a political project within the eu , we try to start with the italians . 
  they are always very enthusiastic and are happy to work with us . 
  however , this cooperation rarely produces any results due to italy 's inabiltiy to cooperate properly and hence we end up working with the germans every time since they actually get work done '' . 
  -- -- -- what 's even more elemental to german power in the eu is what rules the world - money . 
  few things can happen without money , and us being the biggest economy creates the need for us contributing . 
  especially when it comes to the eurozone . 
   it does not matter how manny rules you are breaking , as long as you are breaking one , you have no mandate to tell other countries to stop breaking them . 
  actually that is not a fair comparison . 
  the rule is only broken if several macroeconomic numbers are severely wrong . 
  we are not breaking any rule right now . 
   if the only thing the other countries can use against them is `` muh sovereignity '' or input any nationalistic bs , then they can be seen as a positive example and as a country with mandate of telling other countries how to do things right . 
  eastern europe ca n't really use this against germany . 
  each of the v4 countries is running an export * surplus * against germany . 
   i disaggree , one of the main reasons for the fall of weimar was its incredibly humanitarian , pro freespeech constitution . 
  i disagree on that . 
  what caused weimar to fall was a society not ready for democracy , a flawed political system , a too powerful president and a perversion of direct democracy in conjunction with external facts . 
   what about czech republic , slovakia , romania , countries of former yugoslavia ? 
  well , what about them ? 
  it entirely depends on who is in power at that time . 
   hungary is definite minority in this matter . 
  if all those countries joined together and they actually got backed by eu , orban would have to join too . 
  at the end of the day , he is just another populist . 
  he just needs a second country to join him and i am pretty certain that he will stand his ground on that . 
   all budgetary rules of eurozone the export surplus is n't really a `` broken rule '' . 
  the rule says that there must not be `` severe macroeconomic imbalances '' . 
  these balances consist of a multitude of factors and areas . 
  germany is breaking * one * of them . 
  other countries are disobeying much a lot more of them . 
  i can guarantee you that the likes of orban will complain about a `` loss of souvereignty '' if the negotiation is done by the eu in the future . 
  and i see no realistic scenario where this gets implemented until some eastern european countries give up on their obstructionist policies in some areas . 
  i have no problem with the eu buying gas as an entity to reduce gas prices for eastern europe . 
  i am a firm believer in equipping the pipelines that currently go westwards to revert the flow to ensure that there is no possibility of them getting cut off . 
  so no , i do n't want to say `` fuck ee '' , i simply believe in other ways of fixing the existing problems . 
   ultimately , all will depend on what will germany do , once russia will ramp up prices in eastern eu . 
  that 's already happening , gas going through these countries has n't prevented that . 
   but like ... wasnt poland more affected by those sanctions than germany ? 
  or eeu in general ? 
  poland was hit harder by russias sanctions on the eu , germany was hit harder by the sanctions from `` our '' side . 
  polands total trade with russia was worth around 10 bn in 2012 . 
  germany * lost * around 20 bn ( or about 50 % ) in annual trade with russia since the sanctions were implemented . 
  poland has seen a drastic decrease in exports as well , albeit not as much as germany from what i can see . 
   was there any negative economic effect noticable in germany caused by them ? 
  some companies that have a large export share to russia surely felt it . 
  the economy as a whole did n't due to our general economic success in recent times . 
   https://www.ft.com/content/91508464-c661-11e3-ba0e-00144feabdc0?mhq5j=e2 tusk is not explicitly opposing anything here . 
   https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2014-12-17/central-and-south-eastern-europe-after-cancellation-south-stream i read nothing of polish opposition there . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der#gazprom schr\u00f6der exercises no influence over the current government . 
  ns ii was negotiated after merkel became chancellor . 
  neither merkel nor anyone else on the current cabinet has ties to gazprom . 
   but , `` the ec letter confirmed that the rules for applying eu law , including the third energy package [ which regulates the block 's gas and electricity markets ] to gas pipelines built along the sea bottom are unclear , '' the osw added . 
  the letter stated that the ec will try to receive a mandate from eu governments to negotiate an agreement with russia , so that some of the general principles of energy law would apply to the offshore part of nord stream 2 . 
  this does not mean that it violates eu law . 
   right . 
  pressure by cutting funding , spearheading ns project , undermining nabucco as much as possible . 
  if germany would support it , we now would be receiving gas from azerbaijan . 
  instead we are tied again to a man who gave zero fucks when he downed civilian airliner and send military to start war on continent . 
  even if that was the case - it would be totally irrelevant to this . 
  germany supported south stream by the way . 
  thats a totally different issue , again . 
   yes , cee was opposed to it including poland it was n't .
