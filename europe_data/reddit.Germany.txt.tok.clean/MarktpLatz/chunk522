   but gazprom money in german politics is too sweet present any evidence of gazprom spending money in german politics . 
   commission is strongly opposed to ns2 , dont try to pretend how you have eu on your side as you dont . 
  i have simply stated that it , contrary to the claims of poland , does not violate eu laws . 
  this has been confrmed by the commission . 
   and lets not forget how germany nuked nabucco , all to service of putin interests . 
  nabucco was n't `` nuked '' by germany . 
  you should read up when nabucco was cancelled . 
  it happened over four years later , for different reasons . 
   no country in europe should be able to be threaten by russias control of energy . 
  sure , but there are other ways to accomplish that than sanctioning russia . 
  regular trade is no `` dependence '' . 
  increasing the wealth on both sides through trade is nothing bad . 
   there are several anti muslim submission every day and there are literally comments like `` muslims are nazis '' and the mods are fine with that . 
  feel free to point out posts of this kind to us . 
  shoot us a mod mail or simply report the stuff . 
   but you get banned for calling someone far right/altright . 
  this sub has reached t_d level . 
  that 's a baseless allegation and i do not recall someone being banned for simply calling someone else `` far right '' . 
  wo n't happen . 
  especially not since it hardly leaves any traces . 
  i never claimed something else . 
  * however * , polands ( and the rest of the countries opposing it ) opposition is hypocritical - you have n't been opposed to south stream which would have accomplished the same , only would hungary have been on the benefitting side of the deal . 
  poland is afraid of losing transit fees , but the eu has been clear that ns ii does not violate any eu laws . 
  and then ? 
  there is no point in doing so . 
  we are not `` working with the russians to isolate eastern europe '' . 
  do n't talk nonsense . 
  in fact , germany has been one of the most vocal advocates of sanctions against russia in the eu . 
  we have seen more decrease in trade with russia than you have trade with russia in total ( even before the sanctions ) . 
  and no , nato does n't make european energy diversification your issue . 
  that 's actually an eu goal . 
  nato has nothing to do with it .

  north stream ii is a pan-european project . 
  many countries are involved in this . 
  and schr\u00f6der being at gazprom has n't prevented us from sanctioning russia in the past . 
  germany is hardly one of the countries that are pushing to get rid of sanctions .

   on top of that they made sure that these recently passed sanctions actually impact russia energy dominance over ee . 
  the us senate basically told the orange oaf to fuck off and putin to fuck off . 
  that 's not the business of the us however . 
  this is an eu-russia issue and the us is actively harming some of our countries by doing so .

  as far as i know , the `` larger '' plans are completely free of charge and up to the data limit of your plan . 
  however , this being germany , it is n't exactly much . 
  2-8 gb in most cases . 
  in germany they did something similar - however they did that months ago , long before the legislation went into effect . 
  but where 's the fun in that ? 
   oh , very funny / u/marktplatz please direct your complaints at / u/1010x ,
