  there is zero possibility of a major upset in germany . 
  the biggest upset possible would be a leftwing majority , but they are miles away from a majority and it seems more and more unlikely that they would even be able to form a coalition due to political incompatibilities . 
  and even that would n't really cause major changes . 
  schulz and merkel are on the same side on many policital topics . 
  you can look forwards to a relaxed , smooth german election in september at least ,

  we do have a quality standard for sources . 
  hence why many publications , including all british tabloids , are banned . 
  yahoo news is borderline , but we rarely get submissions from that site anyways . 
   some people in the comment section accused you of being racist for not removing the thread lol well , arguably the source was very shitty . 
  we would have preferred another source , but there was none at that time . 
  i think we would n't admit that exact source again today . 
  but yeah , the comment section was a total shitfest . 
   some of the mods are openly xenophobic . 
  kind of ironic . 
  we are either accused of being nazis or of being refugee-loving leftwingers .

  the french and british carriers carry less than half the amount of jets than the old us carriers do in peacetime . 
  that 's simply not enough if you come back to the topic of `` protecting japan '' . 
  additionally , the response time is singnificantly worse than for the us - the us has distributed its carrier groups all over the world for good reason , it allows for quick response times . 
  `` an allied carrier group might arrive in a few weeks time '' is n't exactly a credible `` threat '' . 
  there is a * big * difference between a blue water navy ( which is entirely realistic for a country of our size ) and a navy worthy of global power projection .

  you do realize that the raw cost of building such a carrier is the least of my concerns ? 
  building up the capabilities of operating a carrier is a very lenghty and expensive process . 
  your new carriers have a personnel of 4,600 + people - our whole navy has 16,000 . 
  this does n't take into account the personnel for the whole supporting fleet . 
  and building up such a support fleet is expensive as hell as well . 
  additionally , there is a need for expensive aircrafts and expensive pilot training . 
  building a carrier fleet is completey unrealistic for a country like germany . 
  merkel is aware of that . 
  trust me . 
  refusing to negotiate paris is the way to go . 
  no concessions to be made here . 
  paris is the minimum that needs to be achieved . 
  acting like this is even remotely realistic ( germany with a military that has enough global projection power to replace the us as a military partner for japan ) is just a bit delusional . 
  this is n't about `` wanting '' to do it or not considering it being worth it .
