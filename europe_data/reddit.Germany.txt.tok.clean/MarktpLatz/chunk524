  it simply ca n't and wo n't happen . 
   in the 1980s the uk was spending 5 % of its gdp on its military and with less financial resources than germany has now . 
  it 's not ridiculous - it 's perfectly achievable . 
  this was in the middle of the cold war . 
  germany spent 5 % as well - in the 60s . 
  there is no need to spend 5 % without immediate threat . 
  if the us wants to spend this much fine , but it is not necessary and it should n't force us to do the same . 
   according to the article , they 're not going along with mutti on an international agreement because they feel our military support is too important . 
  you need to realize that military force is n't just a tool of war - it 's the most vital tool of diplomacy . 
  you do n't have diplomacy without military power . 
  therefore if you want to be able to oppose us diplomatically like merkel wants to , it 's not negotiable - you need more military . 
  you can very well have diplomacy without military power . 
  and this is n't about `` going along on an international agreement '' . 
   apparently it 's serious enough to japan . 
  does n't make your comparison any less ridiculous . 
  if the us were n't spending as much as they are and if they were n't used to the role they are in , they would n't increase their military spending because japan feels threatened by a lunatic in nk . 
   yes , you might have to spend ( gasp ) more than 2 % . 
  which would be kind of ridiculous  you actually can afford it better than we can . 
  we have a deficit . 
  you have a surplus . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  your economy is several times the size of germany 's . 
  you could cut your military funding in half and still remain the single most dominant world power . 
  even spending 2 % would be several times the amount of our surplus . 
   it 's merkel 's idea to do this , not mine . 
  the problem is that she ca n't accomplish her diplomatic objectives because germany 's military is n't sufficient for the task . 
  even if we had such a military , i have significant doubts that japan would even agree to this . 
  the military alliance with the us has worked well for decades , why switch ? 
   you know it very much went against the general opinion of our population to be involved in ww1 or ww2 , and the un , and to be in europe for the last 70 years , being constantly subjected to war and the threat of annihilation for the sake of european democracy , and for that matter , to be in korea and japan for the last 60-70 years . 
  this is n't a universe in which we get to do whatever we want . 
  you are not seriously comparing the american engagement in the world wars with the `` threat '' of north korea . 
  that 's just ridiculous and ignorant . 
   the us wields about as much clout as the rest of the g-20 combined , for good or ill it 's impossible to ignore . 
  depending on the area , this could possibly change . 
  on environmentalism and trade for example . 
  if the us chooses to withdraw from the front row of these policy areas on the world stage , their influence on these areas will decrease . 
  and given how trump is acting , i dare to say significantly . 
  now , this wo n't change the fact that the us will remain the single most powerful nation on earth for the forseeable future , but i would argue that the global influence of the us used to be quite a bit more significant . 
  i 'd like to draw a parallel to putin 's russia : russia is powerful due to its power to disrupt and block things , not because they are actively pushing for things . 
  i see trump going into the same direction . 
  the power of shaping the future and the world is much more significant than just preventing other players from shaping it . 
   gosh , if only germany had a military capable of global power projection , then it could assist japan with those security concerns . 
  but have n't we learned that militaries are stupid and pointless ?? 
  siggy says it 's better to buy non-military stuff and count it as military spending . 
  in what world are you living ? 
  even if germany spent 2 % , we would not have a military worthy of global power projection . 
  at least not of the kind that would be required in this regard . 
  germany is no naval power , we are neither going to operate carriers nor nuclear submarines . 
  we have a goddamn brown ( ish ) water navy . 
  not even talking about the fact that germany is far less involved in that region than the us . 
  for good reason , i 'd like to add - the us is separated by an ocean from japan . 
  for us , it is thousands of miles of other countries between us and them . 
  if you want to look for more reasons - look at the trading relationships between japan and us . 
  the trade relationship with the us is significantly more important for both sides . 
  additionally , this would go up against the general opinion on military here , both in politics and amongst the population . 
  -- -- -- even the uk or france are not capable of projecting this kind of power . 
  only the us is capable of doing that , anyone who claims that a country ( other than china in maybe 10-20 years ) could come even close to `` replacing '' the us is talking nonsense . 
   when she ignored his very pertinent concerns about juncker everyone else considered juncker to be qualified . 
  this is not up to a single country to decide . 
  and electing him was good for the same reason that electing tusk again was good . 
   when she barely co-operated on the uk `` renegotiation '' going further would have meant giving up on some of the eu freedoms . 
  this is n't a catalog the uk can choose from . 
  everyone else is ( somewhat ) fine with these rules , why should they be modified on the demand of a single member ?
