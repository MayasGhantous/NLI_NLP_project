  ah alright . 
  does that even qualify as `` labour protection '' though ? 
  it kind of sounds a bit like the danish model . 
   like every people who quit their job by themselves how does this work ? 
  how can you be protected from losing your job if you are leaving it at your own will ?

  honestly , since you are unable to hold a conversation without insulting the other person , this is the end of that conversation . 
  consider this a warning for personal attacks . 
   hartz , and please dont pretend to be snarky , you know what i meant . 
  even if you are adressing the hartz reforms - they were by no means `` easy '' . 
  they were met by a lot of resistance in the population , they caused us to breach the defitic rules and the party that enacted them is sufferering from them to this day . 
   it gives stupid perquisites to joining , ez 's end goal should be for all eu members to join . 
  if you want everyone to join ( which is the case ) you need reasonable criteria for countries willing to join - otherwise the currency wo n't work . 
   you know how germany bitched about that 2 % nato spending , cause they simply would not know where to put those tanks/planes/gunships . 
  that 's the rhetoric , but the main reason is that we do not see good reasons to do so and that we are unwilling to spend this much money . 
   guess what some states need to borrow more and setting a % out of your ass does nothing to remedy the situation . 
  this does n't even correlate remotely with nato spending . 
   why 3 % ? 
  debt to gdp really means jack shit cause it all depends on the type of debt not really , no . 
  and there are possibilities not to sanction countries if the overspending is justified ( e.g. 
  labour market reform ) . 
   by not supporting eurobonds you 're making the whole think more unstable as shocks to individual members can profoundly change how the euro is doing . 
  if we have shared debt , those individual shocks wont matter as much . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  if countries were n't affected by their own actions any more , they would be less careful . 
   mate , sorry but that 's literally having a problem with other countries having debt . 
  but if you want a sustainable currency , you need some rules that everyone obeys . 
   debt does not matter to a country the same as it does to you , most of eu common debt will be covered by issuing of bonds . 
  sharing debt makes investing in the eu safer and easier . 
  it would transfer the burden onto us . 
  no , thanks . 
  unless there are safeguards against overspending , this does n't make sense . 
   a simple hertz plan can fix everything what is `` a simple hertz plan '' ? 
   most eastern european countries dont have a welfare state they can further cut in to . 
  how is that even relevant ? 
  most countries east of germany are n't even part of the euro . 
   this economic model of no debt accumulation is not stable for countries who do n't have a massive industrial base and foreign capital is simply not enough to jump start every small eu economy . 
  germany is n't against other countries going into debt . 
  however , we would like other ez countries to stay below 3 % new debt per annum . 
   what 's the problem with taking debt for building our future ? 
  given that there are countries in the eurozone with a history of significant overspending , there is a significant problem . 
  if you have access to `` free '' money which other countries guarantee , you will be much less inclined to reform your country . 
  and reforms are pretty much always a good thing as long as they are reasonable . 
  well , what was left of spar is now edeka , so it could be worse .

  editorialization . 
   i have the right to freedom of speech the same as anyone other man the `` freedom of speech '' does n't really mean what you think . 
  first amendment rights are not protected here . 
  free speech is limited by the subreddit rules . 
  it does n't really make sense to do so before the us actually leaves the agreement , which will take a few more years , though . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  the reaction to a party not honouring an agreement should n't be not following through on own promises . 
  rejecting the target would probably cause trump to do something stupid and it could do irreparable damage to nato . 
  and we still rely on nato , no matter how much we want to twist words about that . 
  additionally , it would alienate the whole of the us . 
  it is pretty much consensus in the political class in the us that europe needs to spend more on military . 
  trump is only a period , but we need to have a working relationship with the us long term . 
  not even talking about the fact that nato breaking up ( which would be a possible outcome of such a step ) would result in us having to spend more on military .

  in german labour law , it can qualify as such . 
  that 's `` spar express '' . 
  pretty much everything that is left from a giant company . 
  they only have a number of small convenience stores in train stations and gas stations . 
  there is . 
  intentionally being overly careful on every step to slow down the work process can count as striking in germany .
