  spar germany closed down over a decade ago . 
  actually , his party did n't receive the most votes . 
  they `` just '' received the most seats . 
  parliamentary systems usually only print parties on the ballot , the candidate for chancellor/pm/whatever is n't on it . 
  this is only different in systems where the president is elected directly . 
  apparently you lived behind the moon then . 
  the whole eu election campaign was about the choice between schulz and juncker as president . 
  if you spent five minutes on informing you prior to the election you would know . 
  or if you just looked at the campaign posters on the streets . 
  eleven times , to be precise . 
  and apparently , he/his staff said similar stuff during his recent visit . 
  they were under the impression that their trade conditions with belgium are different to the conditions with germany . 
  yes . 
  and before you come with `` that 's just a low percentage of the european electorate '' : this is the fault of the voters . 
  if they do not go vote , they ca n't complain . 
  this is how democracy works . 
  and additionally , it * is * quite a lot of votes . 
  for comparison : macron was elected with 20.7 million votes , merkels party recieved around 15 million votes in the last election . 
  the alliance that he was the candidate for recieved 38,610,376 votes . 
   greece ca n't leave without settling it 's debts which is impossible . 
  they can . 
  they can not leave the euro without settling their debt while staying in the eu . 
  they could leave the eu any day they want - that 's state souvereignty . 
  it would probably lead to sanctions or other repercussions , but it is possible . 
  the relevant treaties and agreements have no clause preventing them from doing so . 
  and no , the government of greece was n't wanted by the eu . 
  the eu would have preferred nd to stay in power . 
  the syriza government wants to remain in the eu * and * in the euro . 
  the `` unelected losers '' in the commission are the equivalent of ministers in the national states which are - surprise - not elected either . 
  does n't make it undemocratic . 
   yes they are unable to issue article 50 due to agreements made during their bailouts . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  the reason why greece is still in the eu is that they want to remain . 
  this is not only the goal of the greek government but also the will of the greek people . 
  the eu has no possibility to take that option away from greece . 
  i do not know where you are from . 
  but if you are from a parliamentary democracy , like it is present in most of europe , then i have to tell you that juncker is about as elected as your national government .

  germany has never tried to send refugees from german soil elsewhere . 
  they are certainly better paid than the infamous `` mini-jobs '' . 
   to a very small extend . 
  well , 175,000 people as of january . 
  the number of jobs paying social insurance ( `` real jobs '' ) has increased . 
  the decrease in unemployment has been accompanied with a lot of these `` mini-jobs '' being converted into `` real jobs '' . 
  that 's actually not true . 
  around 175,000 refugees are registered as `` unemployed '' . 
  it 's just that the increase in employement for the other people has increased enough to offset this . 
  of course , there are a lot more refugees than that and they will eventually cause the unemployment number to increase , but we are not at this point yet . 
   these numbers mean nothing . 
  rising number of jobs paying social insurance * does * mean something .

  changed that to `` killed '' . 
  unless there is evidence that someone targeted european embassies , this is off-topic . 
  embassies are , contrary to public opinion , not foreign soil . 
  it did n't happen on the area of the german embassy 3 . 
  german embassy personnel was n't killed . 
  this was in the middle of several embassies,

   internal police reports put the amount of assailants `` at least 2,000 men '' . 
  that 's the definition of `` thousands '' as far as i know , this number is a bit misleading . 
  the assaults came `` out of a group of 2000 men '' , this does n't mean that all 2000 have necessarily been active participants . 
   also nonsense . 
  the reason why there was such a public outcry on this sub is because even after the mainstream media ( e.g. 
  the new york times ) started reporting , the mods here were still removing posts . 
  for example i remember it happening more than a week after nye . 
  i was n't a mod back then , but you can find major posts from january 5th on . 
   if i am surrounded by 10 cops and 5 of those shoot and kill me , people will say i 'm shot by the cops . 
  i never said `` every single mod here is engaged in censorship '' , but the mods that did not did n't stop their fellow abuse mods neither . 
  your whole comment is about semantics , and wrong .
