  a car produced in the us does n't affect the trade balance directly . 
  a car built in the us will neither increase nor decrease the us trade balance unless it is exported . 
  * however * , car manufacturing is very much a global process . 
  i am fairly certain that the cars manufactured in the us use some parts manufactured in germany/europe , thus increasing the us trade deficit . 
  it affect around 66.000 kids . 
  66,000 * 12 * 190 = ~ 150,000,000 $ assuming this would be cut in half , it would save around 75 millions annually . 
  not eactly a lot of money . 
  you were called the `` nasty country '' when you attempted to cut benefits for eu workers * inside * your country . 
  that 's a bit of a difference . 
  this is just about the children that do not live here . 
  and it actually makes quite a lot of sense . 
  the costs of living in poland is much lower than in germany , there is no justification for them recieving what is about 40 % of the country 's minimum wage just in benefits per child . 
   as i just joined / r/europe i hope you enjoy your stay here , 
  is n't office sharing a trend today ? 
   up until recently the mods here were censoring all posts that were n't in line with their agenda , e.g. 
  posts critical of immigration or islam . 
  it kinda reached a peak and tippingpoint ~ 2 years ago when the nye rape assault happened in cologne where thousands of migrants sexually assaulted women , and the mods kept removing it as `` local news '' . 
  not really accurate . 
  first of all `` thousands '' is an overexaggeration . 
  secondly , the story was removed as a local crime in the very beginning , when the dimensions were n't clear yet . 
  we had several posts about after it became clear what exactly happened . 
  and last but not least - there were some mods that were too triggerhappy in this regard , not `` the mods '' and `` recently '' is n't accurate either . 
  nye cologne was almost one and a half year ago , to put things into perspective .

  we do have that too at the moment , and the mod in question is not german . 
  i 'll have to disagree with you there . 
  automatic messages would lead to two things at the moment : 1 . 
  it will clog up our mailbox . 
  unfortunately , reddits mail managing system is rubbish when you are a mod . 
  even though they recently redesigned the mod mail , everything you reply to still ends up in your private inbox . 
  this makes it extremely difficult to find old messages . 
  it would be too much work . 
  and by that , i do not mean the process of removing the comments but adressing the complaints that would follow every removal . 
  we already have a decent number of users complaining about their posts being removed , god help us if the same thing happened for comments . 
  all of us are volunteers and this simply would be too much . 
  countries rarely decide what name they wear in other languages . 
  the czech government has recently pushed for the country to be called `` czechia '' in english , but habits die hard . 
  in germany it has always been `` tschechien '' since they split up .

   but why would any country negotiate better trade deals than what the european union has now ? 
  is n't it likely that whatever trade deals are , they will be on the whole worse than current , because the uk on its own had less bargaining power than the eu ? 
  disclaimer : i am far from neutral on this topic since i do believe that the uk will be worse off outside the eu . 
  however , it is a tradeoff .
