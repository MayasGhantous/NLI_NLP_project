  yes , the uk has less raw negotiating power than the eu . 
  on the other side , the uk negotiating trade agreement on its own will very likely be quicker than negotiating them through the eu . 
  additionally , the trade agreements will fit the uk better than agreements negotiated through the eu . 
  the british economy is quite a bit different from all the other countries on the continent and `` one size fits all '' agreements are just the result of the smallest denominator of the interests of 28 countries and thus inherently less well-fitting for the uk ( or any other eu country for that matter ) .

  yup . 
  most german states are running a surplus . 
  they are also mandated to balance their budgets until 2020 . 
  circumvention of subreddit rules of this kind is n't tolerated . 
  you cant really get `` out of touch '' if you have never been in touch with reality to be honest , 
  it is . 
  the chancellor does n't live there . 
  merkel continues to live in her flat in berlin . 
  her predecessor , schr\u00f6der , only spent the weekdays in the small flat in the * kanzleramt * and chose to spend the weekends with his family in hanover . 
  the flat inside the * kanzleramt * is 178 m \u00b2 large , but only 28 m \u00b2 are private facilities for the chancellor , the rest serves representative purposes . 
  the chancellor has to pay rent ( !! ), 
  to the federal republic to use these facilities . 
  the reason why it is so large is the fact that it is the workplace for most of the staff of the chancellor - 590 people . 
  it is an own federal ministry with a budget of 2.41 bn $ . 
  well , i have never met someone who called it that way . 
  however , it is the closest thing that shape reminds of . 
  it is also called `` washing machine '' . 
  it 's larger , but `` several times the size '' is n't correct if you take into account the wings of the white house .

  still rather simplistic . 
  and to be honest - i quite like it . 
  many people have said about the french leaders ( most french ministers have offices that look similar to the president 's ) that you get out of touch with reality if you are working in an environment full of gold with imperialistic history .

  [ picture showing more of the room ] ( https://www.bayernkurier.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0276-930x523.jpg ) helmut schmidt once said that it could as well be the office of a small bank .

  there were soviet troops in austria during the time where nato was founded . 
  the soviet union rejected to withdraw their troops until stalins death in 1953 . 
  afterwards , austria and the ussr signed the `` memorandum of moscow '' , promising that they would declare themselves a neutral country after the withdrawal of the soviet troops . 
  austria pretty much stayed neutral until they joined the eu .

  thanks , i 'll take a look at it if i find some time !, 
  by that logic , we should also admit posts about the investigations into donald trumps team since a possible impeachment would have a significant impact on the eu . 
  it simply is too remote for us , sorry .
