  that 's a bit of a complicated topic . 
  [ look here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens%e2%80%99_rights_directive ) , and [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement_for_workers_in_the_european_union ) this might clear some things up . 
  `` freedom of movement '' is a very general term used to describe different things . 
  most people associate schengen with the `` freedom of movement '' even though it , strictly speaking , is n't really part of the `` four freedoms '' . 
  yeah , that 's how it is . 
  from a legal perspective , that makes sense . 
  i think you have a misunderstanding here . 
  it is completely fine that some germans pay less and that foreigners pay more than before . 
  what matters is that there is some abstract criteria for who pays what . 
  simply mirroring the cost 1:1 is discriminatory , any other amount works .

  that 's too vague for a good argument . 
  none of these countries has established a toll `` only for foreigners '' . 
  it is completely fair to target all road users , as long as everyone is treated equally . 
  and before you say `` but their car tax is probably lower due to the toll '' - it is n't . 
  owning a car in austria is significantly more expensive than in germany . 
  the general tax for operating a car is higher , the vat which you pay when buying the car is over 5 % higher , they also have eco taxes and co2 taxes when buying a car . 
  of course it is dumb . 
  that 's why we do not like it either . 
  it is just populism without any positive effect in the real world . 
  no other country has been `` targeting germans '' . 
  present some evidence for this . 
   i guess most car owners pay income taxes and vat here 's the problem : not all people paying income tax are car owners , same applies to people paying vat . 
  if you want to relief the people from the money they would have to pay as a toll , you would actually lose money if you modified the mentioned taxes since you would also decrease these taxes for people who do not even pay the toll . 
  not even talking about the fact that the income tax is ( unlike the car tax ) progressive . 
   i 'm not a fan of toll either , because it obstructs free movement and therefore tourism . 
  that 's not free movement . 
   however , it 's silly and hypocritical to act as if germany is targeting foreigners since that 's inherent to changing from a system in which only germans pay to a system in which all road users pay while not changing road expenditures . 
  foreign car drivers already pay vasts amounts of money to the german state through the taxes on gasoline . 
  and no , you do not `` need to act like we are targeting foreigners '' - this is exactly the whole point of this law . 
  exactly . 
  actually , there is a toll gap as far as i know . 
  the truck toll applies from 7.5 tons , the proposed car toll only applies to vehicles up to 3.5 tons . 
  i am not aware of any other tax that fulfills this purpose . 
  and actually , we do n't want the toll ourselves . 
  well , present evidence that the toll in these countries has been accompanied by a tax decrease of the same amount . 
  their tolls also were n't advertised as `` toll only for foreigners '' . 
  it does n't matter if you have it or not - the value for money stays exactly the same .

  pant ? 
  this is still unclear . 
  the commission says the modifications cleared out their concerns , but some of our neighbor countries are ( fortunately ) taking this to the ecj . 
  no freedom of movement involved here by the way .

  that 's a ridiculous claim that lacks any basis . 
  yes , that works - as long as the deployments happen under the roof of international defence organizations like nato or the un .
