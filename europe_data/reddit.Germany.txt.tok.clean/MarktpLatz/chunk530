  this is based on art . 
  24 ii gg , the bundesverfassungsgericht specified this in [ bverfge 90 , 286 ] ( http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv090286.html ) where they mandated that the approval of the parliament is required in most scenarios . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  you fundamentally misunderstand what 's happening here . 
  and arguing that germany might use military might against the czech republic is just ridiculous , not even talking about the suggestion that we would use czech troops to do so . 
  spending 2 % on 200,000 soldiers would probably work . 
  there is no definite answer what this would look like as a lot depends on where the government would spend that money and on how technology progresses . 
  tanks will eventually become autonomous vehicles , as will jets , greatly reducing the menpower required to operate them . 
  it also depends on what we want the bundeswehr to be - there are fundamental differences between an army designed for foreign operations and asymmetrical conflicts and a `` classic '' army focused on country defense in symmetrical wars . 
  it is still the czech government that has the last say on any actual military action of czech soldiers . 
  the german government can not do that . 
  calm down . 
  removed - dupe . 
  removed . 
  off topic . 
  gone now .

  thanks !, 
  please provide a transcript of the article , 
   it is an easilly abused feature for those in power and frankly i 'm not sure bypassing admins like that should be allowed . 
  how should that be prevented ? 
  this only takes advantage of the tools already provided by the system . 
  and no , it is n't bypassing the admins - mods are free to mod subreddits in whatever way they consider appropriate . 
  and generally speaking , bot bans can be a good tool to certain scenarios . 
  it gets troublesome if someone gets botbanned without them deserving that - because it 's not always noticeable , unlike a regular ban . 
  we generally try to refrain from using them on this subreddit however .

  religion classes at school usually are , unlike classes provided by the religious entities , focussing on the different sides and aspects of religion , under certain circumstances teaching critical thinking about religion . 
  i would n't condemn it in general .

  it 's not like we would need their approval . 
  i mean , what the hell is the point of this ? 
  it does n't . 
  there is no eu criminal code . 
  it would n't , because the legal realities and regulations were completely different in the eu . 
  no , that 's not about `` trying to milk them as hard as possible '' , it 's due to the fact that the laws mandated a whole different of level of fines . 
  if facebook would be fined a fixed amount for every user affected , the numbers would get really big really quick . 
  you will probably have to ask in / r/askeurope or in the subreddit of the country you plan to move to . 
   but yes , buisness interests certainly dont have anything to do with pushes for immigration !, 
  that would be impossible . 
  that is why germany never took the gastarbeiter . 
  there is a difference between having an interest in immigration because you want to push wages down and having an interest in immigration because you can not find workers . 
  plus business interests have certainly not been the reason for taking in refugees . 
   other than common sense ? 
  read `` hive mind '' by garreth jones and citations therein . 
  it discusses the importance of makeup of political institutions and how it results from average education and other qualities of citizens . 
  so it 's just general theory without any solid evience . 
   unless the process has become fundamentally more difficult , exactly this will happen again for a lot of new migrant , when the political class deems it necessary to depress worker wages a little . 
  give me a source that this has ever been the reasoning before . 
  the path to german citizenship has been the same for quite a while now . 
   it likely takes a massive dip eventually [ citation needed ]  since institutional efficiency will decline if you have loads of people importing their insitutional culture again , any evidence ? 
   and voting patterns as well not really . 
  most of the people who came here will not be eligible for german citizenship in the forseeable future . 
  in this case , the argument should not be based on a change in average gdp per capita , like op did . 
   gdp per capita measures quality of life for the average citizen ( more or less ) . 
  that 's flawed logic . 
  if the average gdp per capita decreases , it does not mean that the actual gdp per capita for the people who had been here previously decreases as well .

  that actually would not make a lot of sense . 
  starting with the fact that communist/soviet influence was a lot more severe and enduring .

  you are a one month old account , yet you are throwing around ridiculous allegations that lack any basis . 
  well , i am still actively commenting , but in many cases , it is true , unfortunately . 
  there is nothing to `` cope '' with . 
  there is no difference in moderation . 
  simply because we are not ideological biased while modding . 
   you accepted first antieu moderator ? 
  i guess we should throw a party !, 
  not that it will change anything .
