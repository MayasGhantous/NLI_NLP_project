  the current set of rules works quite well for us . 
  it passed under the radar , it should have been removed immediately . 
  the rules are that strict because we want to have a certain amount of control over what happens in regard to polls , they can be easily manipulated and can be damaging at times . 
  yeah , that somewhat went under the radar : /, 
  we do not tolreate polls without prior approval by the mods .

   comey 's firing is just the most recent example it is also an example that a `` written response '' can be 100 % contradictory to what trump says . 
  `` limiting the press '' is not a `` voice of reason '' , it is simply less bad .

  [ the german entry of 2000 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gl37zfo1po ) , simply because it makes * no * sense whatsoever . 
  ( ended up being placed fifth by the way ), 
  a weak euro is better for the economy , but it reduces the competitive pressure on the economy , making the industry less innovative . 
  german products have always competed because they were better , not because they were cheaper . 
  the euro gives us some relief in this regard , but losing that technological edge would be a disaster . 
  years ago , our industry has said that 1.30 $ / $ would be a sweet spot for them . 
  that will take some time . 
  there are already plans for a cooperation with the french , but the tornado replacement wo n't enter service until at least 2030-35 . 
  please provide a translation . 
  honestly , the companies are n't really in need of even more competitive advantage . 
  it 's the average person that should get a tax break .

   in 2016 this number increased to 17.180 , so an increase of 25,3 % . 
  i am pretty certain that the number of asylum seekers increased more . 
   in comparison , the total number of crimes commited by citizens of turkey in 2015 was 6.660 , so ... you see where i 'm going with this . 
  i am also pretty certain that the number of asylum seekers in berlin is higher than the number of people with turkish citizenship . 
  there are 200,000 people with a turkish migration background in berlin , many of which have a german passport . 
  the influx of asylum seekers in 2015 alone to berlin was 80,000 .

   i said `` a blow '' . 
  it would be the second time in our national history cdu wins there . 
  i was mainly adressing the article with that . 
   for the second , i believe you , but i 'd like to read more on it . 
  care to post a comprehensive article if you have one on hand ? 
  source is my law professor , sorry :p, 
  this is actually just a ( somewhat ) unqualified guess . 
  however , what you are quoting is the number calculated by eurostat , the number from the german government is worse [ ( 5.8 % at the moment ) ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/indikatoren/konjunkturindikatoren/arbeitsmarkt/arb210.html ) . 
  since it is rather unlikely that the us measures it the same way as germany or eurostat , stating that they could well be en par does n't sound that remote . 
   the us is at 4.7 % and germany 3.9 % . 
  due to the fact that those are measured differently , i would say that it is fair to say that germany and the us are more or less en par in this regard . 
   losing nrw would be a big blow to spd it would not kill off schulz ' campaign however - it is not his fault after all . 
  funfact : only nrw and bavaria have the it required to calculate changes to the tax code . 
  losing nrw would mean that the spd would n't be able to propose good tax legislation anymore . 
   germans are already whispering schulz 's candidacy may not survive next weekend . 
  i have n't heared anything of this kind . 
   either way , merkel seems to have little to fear in her reelection bid : the most recent national poll gives her a lead of 11 points . 
  civey is an unproven polling agency so far . 
  none of the established polling agencies show a discrepancy of over 8 % . 
   what 's strange about merkel 's record of electoral success is how consistently she has confirmed the adage that policy failures are an unavoidable part of politics , while avoiding its corollary : that erosions of public support are inevitable , too . 
  that 's simply not the case . 
   in instances like her decision not to intervene in libya as far as i know , the main driving force behind the german abstention was n't merkel , it was our foreign minister westerwelle . 
  0.5 % of gdp is actually a huge amount of money when you economy equals 3.1 trillion $ .
