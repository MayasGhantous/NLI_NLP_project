  removed . 
  use / r/askeurope for questions of this kind . 
  varies . 
  it always depends on how many mods are active ( sometimes , several mods are absent , which naturally increases the workload ) and whether we have controversial topics or posts reaching / r/all ( this almost always turns into a shitfest in need of a * lot * of moderation ) .

  the problem is not the pay . 
  the problem is that there are not enough qualified people in the pool of unemployed people to fill these jobs . 
  champignons are a type of mushrooms . 
  all champignons are mushrooms , not all mushrooms are champignons . 
  the term for mushrooms is `` fungi '' if i am not mistaken . 
   that 's not even true . 
  there is a joined eu outer-border defence , it 's just bad and not enough . 
  you should read up on frontex . 
  frontex does not have the power to do it on their own . 
  the borders fall into the souvereignty of the respective nations - frontex can only help them if they demand/allow that . 
  it 's still not at a level where we would consider action . 
  his videos that were n't on-topic for this sub have been removed . 
  we will watch for his future posting behaviour though . 
  sidenote : posting videos to a large number of different subs ( which is the main thing making his profile look spammy ) is n't against the rules .

  well , that 's a bit of a misleading quote . 
  sch\u00e4uble does not mean that trump is `` right on nato '' but that he is right that `` every country should aim towards spending 2 % '' - like obama demanded years ago and like it has been agreed upon by the nato countries years ago . 
  trumps claims about nato spending - like saying that `` germany owes the us vast sums of money '' are n't covered by this . 
  that 's completely accurate - however op said that `` they are also not going to cooperate with the spd '' . 
  a few years back that would have been accurate - the fdp focussed on coalitions with the cdu which they saw as a `` natural partner '' and refused to enter coalitions with the spd . 
  this has changed , they explicitly do not rule out forming a government with the spd . 
  this is objectively wrong . 
  there were large refugee streams before merkel said a word on this in public . 
  the current fdp is n't the party it was fourty years ago anymore . 
  they have recently noticed that preferring he cdu in any case is a bad strategy and said that they will not rule out entering a coalition with the spd anymore . 
  defending the external borders is first and foremost a responsibility of the nation states at the border . 
  the fdp have not ruled out working with the spd . 
  the point is that our personal beliefs do not correlate with our ama guests . 
  we have no fn sympathizers on the team as far as i know . 
  there is also the possibility that we simply consider this to be an interesting ama without taking sides . 
  as someone already pointed out - we already did an fn ama two weeks ago . 
  there is no reason to accuse of us partiality in this regard . 
  apart from the fact that this is n't true - this is n't a / r/europe ama , this is an ama of / r/wales . 
  we do not allow self-promotion . 
  it 's the non-participation version of reddit links .

   also it 's quite annoying how mods tolerate it , especially hatred against muslims is tolerated here . 
  that 's objectively wrong . 
  you are pretty much the only one complaining about it . 
  what is proper use of the sticky feature is up to us mods and unless we get large numbers of complaints about it , we see no reason to change our ways in this regard .

  they have a decent shot of making it into the parliament . 
  but that 's about it . 
  nobody is willing to enter a coalition with them and they would need to quintuple their votes to get even close to a majority . 
  there is zero possiblity of an upset in the german election . 
  both major parties are pro-eu and so are the respective candidates of the parties . 
  disagree . 
  macron 's victory alone is n't enough for that . 
  a significant recovery of the french economy is what is required . 
  the french president , no matter who it is , can not be strong without a solid economy backing him or her up .
