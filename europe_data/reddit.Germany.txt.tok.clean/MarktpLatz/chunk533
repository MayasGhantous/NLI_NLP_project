  i apologize for the delayed answer , i have been away for a few days . 
  support for the independence of scotland is n't against the rules and hoping that the uk does worse outside the eu is n't exactly a remote thought if you are pro-eu . 
  all of this is n't `` racism '' or `` xenophpbia '' . 
  and there is an important difference between `` hating the uk '' and hating british people . 
  for comments like `` the uk only wants its empire back '' - well that 's just shitposting other countries have to endure as well . 
  please change that to an np.reddit.com link .

  of course . 
  but it 's about as much as we can do to prevent brigading apart from deleting links completely . 
  to prevent brigading . 
  due to the french election , we have 16,000 online users right now . 
  a correctly placed link would make it possible to fuck over the whole voting system in another sub . 
  calls for brigading are not tolerated . 
  it 's the non-participation version of reddit links . 
  you will still get to the other thread , but you will not be able to comment or vote . 
  thanks !, 
  much appreciated , 
  can confirm . 
  your take is 100 % accurate . 
  lol . 
  i am simply beyond humour , this thread is so much work 2 . 
  i am german, 
  example ? 
  we do not allow comments advocating violence . 
  would depend on the context .
