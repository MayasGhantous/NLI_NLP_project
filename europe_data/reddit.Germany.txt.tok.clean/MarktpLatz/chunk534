  i am pretty sure that the post does not appear on the front page anymore . 
  you have to understand that reddit mods do not have the power to remove things completely . 
  if we remove a post , it will no longer appear in the listed submissions , if we remove a comment , users will not be able to see the comment in the thread anymore . 
  however , the comments will still exist on the profile of such a user . 
  so will the submissions . 
  therefore , you can still `` find '' the thread if you have commented in it , if it is your post or if you have the link .

  likely longer than you are alive . 
  germany applied german law to a crime committed in a foreign embassy in 1934 , treaties negotiated in the 60s confirm this principle . 
  the territories of embassies are an integral part of the host country . 
  removed . 
  use / r/askeurope or / r/travel . 
  ukraines economy was terrible before the russian intervention in the country . 
  the country has been poorly run for decades , it is amongst the most corrupt countries on earth . 
  that 's an outdated view of embassies . 
  they are no longer considered foreign soil . 
  feel free to point out examples of `` racism towards you and your country '' . 
   if she put them on a plane and send back , numbers would have been way lower . 
  not doing that is not an invitation , that 's internationally recognized law . 
  nobody , not even our eastern neighbour countries , did that . 
  there was no `` invitation '' 2 . 
  no law was broken here,

  well , they announced that they would have a candidate in every single constituency . 
  these things are either worse or more complicated than studying in austria . 
  the reason is our system , not yours . 
  the requirements to study medicine are ridiculous here . 
  either you graduate from high school with an average of 1,2 or better ( which is only a * very * tiny percentage of graduates ) or you have to wait for several years . 
  you misunderstood the headline . 
  84 % of germans graduating medicine in * austria * leave austria again . 
  the reason for this is rather simple : the requirements to study medicine in germany are really tough . 
  it is a better and faster option to study in austria instead and return afterwards . 
  you do not have to adapt to a different culture and you already know the language . 
  i think the current polling sounds about right . 
  but even if they are , it would not make a difference : rrg does not have a majority in any poll at the moment and the cdu would need to be underestimated by 4-5 % to make cdu/csu/green work . 
  which is unrealistic .

  that 's actually not accurate . 
  the combination of greens + cdu is n't that problematic . 
  what 's more problematic are the difference between green + fdp and the fact that the csu would prefer not to enter a coalition with the greens for reasons that are about state politics in bavaria . 
  you are missing the point of his statement .
