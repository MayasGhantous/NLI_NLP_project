  short summary : jan b\u00f6hmermann ( german satirist ) sued the right-wing party `` pro deutschland '' for distributing a t-shirt with b\u00f6hmermanns face on it , together with `` he 's funny . 
  i 'll kill him last '' and a signature of recet tyyip erdogan . 
  he reached a preliminary injunction and the party has given in and removed the t-shirt from their website , saying that they do not want to risk a full court case given the monetary costs of it .

   germany has the same problem . 
  only a hand full of people control most newspapers . 
  this is ok at the moment , since they mostly work for the people , and we have a strong public media to balance this , but it is still an unfavourable development . 
  < / serious  this is totally wrong . 
  most major german newspapers are either owned by independent foundations ( faz , zeit ) , owend by their employees ( spiegel ) or organized as cooperatives ( taz ) . 
  the other newspapers are owned by completely different actors . 
  there is no concentration of media control in the hands of a few people like in the uk for example .

  it 's not about what is in the article , it is that we do not allow modification of headlines . 
  and the answer is totally obious . 
  if you do not live under a rock , you should know where these people mainly come from .

  do n't play dumb . 
  there is a difference between equipment that has been built for the bundeswehr and equipment for other countries . 
  our arms industries are more than happy to modify their vehicles for the use in other conditions . 
  here is the flaw in your thought : merkel was n't `` ignoring public opinion '' when she decided to leave the border open - quite the contrary . 
  around 70 % of germans were in favor of doing so at that time . 
  use / r/askeurope please . 
  the far right did n't have a chance before the euro either . 
  so no , this allegation is completely baseless . 
  it is n't . 
   yeah , that 's what i thought . 
  not a stupid move to put your name on a sub that has over a million subscribers , considering no one seems to know them . 
  completely free advertising , especially in a time that is this convenient . 
  i think that is in the eye of the beholder , everyone is free to judge how well ( or badly ) they did on answering the questions . 
   you do n't have every day an opportunity to call poland and baltics pieces of shit on a platform this popular . 
  they see an opportunity and grabbed it . 
  to make it absolutely clear : this opportunity was n't just open for the fn . 
  in fact , we have reached out to macron 's * en marche !, 
  * , offering them to do an ama as well , but they declined . 
   she 's running for president , so her manifesto includes elements that fall within the executive power of a head of state . 
  we 're running for parliament , and specifically in a constituency made up of french expats , so our manifesto include legislative elements with a specific focus on the life of french residents abroad . 
  i am aware of the differences . 
  let me reword this slightly : where do you disagree with marine le pen ?

   almost all authority flows from paris , there 's very limited power at the regional and local levels . 
  it even goes beyond politics and administration - even the rail network of france is entirely focussed on paris . 
  inaccurate . 
  the freedom of movement means something different than just `` no physical borders '' - it means that you can work in every other eu country ( + single market ) for example . 
  which is what op is referring to . 
  how does the program you are running on as a team differ from the program marine le pen is running on ? 
  do your friends and colleagues know about your engagement for the fn and how do they react to it ? 
  removed .

  one could point to different factors , but the main factor is that the balkan route is more or less closed . 
  yes , there are still people coming through , but nowhere near the 2015 or 2016 levels . 
  should turkey stop the deal , it would mainly fuck greece and not us .

   i dont have more in common with germans , french anymore then i have with an american ever been to the us ? 
  you quickly start to notice that you do have more in common with your fellow europeans when you are over there . 
  you being an american should tell you that this usually does n't even happen . 
  german was a very popular language in your country for a long time and only world wars were able to eliminate it from regular use . 
  not really . 
  a repeat of 2015 simply wo n't happen - even if turkey cancels the deals ( which they wont ) . 
  even at the height of the refugee crisis , germany was more politically stable than many of our neighbors in regular times .
