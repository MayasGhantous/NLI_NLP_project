  that 's bullshit . 
  macron was n't the only french candidate who met merkel . 
  germany is a somewhat natural ally for france in the eu , they do not need a special relationship for that . 
  and his support is not related to germany , seriously .

   yes , i noticed it after wrote the reply , must have missed it before and i 'm sorry for that . 
    i do n't know what you mean by `` approved '' , i meant it as in `` it appears on subreddit '' . 
  as i understand if automod is not triggered it remains shown . 
  alright , let me show you something : [ this is what the queue of unmodded submissions looks like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1egb0vh.jpg ) ( tiny excerpt ) . 
  the post highlighted in red has been removed by the automod and put up for manual approval . 
  it does n't appear on the public subreddit page right now ( and given the nature of that post , it never will lol ) . 
  the other two submissions have not seen any mod action yet , but they were not filtered and are visible on the subreddit . 
  if we click on the green button , we approve the post and nothing will change - the post will stay up . 
  until then , it has not been `` approved '' , but i can understand your confusion . 
  in the unmodded queue ( which you saw in the screenshot ) , all submissions are listed and they stay until they are either approved or removed . 
  they are listed in a chronological order . 
   yeah , but still the reddit algorithm does n't take into account time of approval but time of submission so it will be less favored and will not enter `` rising '' queue etc. 
  fair enough . 
  but in my ( our ) opinion , the current way is way superior to allowing everything and * then * taking action . 
   anyways , thanks for replying . 
  no problem . 
  wtf ? 
  if you have any questions about this removal , please [ contact the mods ] ( / message/compose / ? to = / r/europe & subject = moderation ) . 
  this kind of language is n't tolerated . 
  mods have taken a look and taken action . 
   well , so that means some submission are approved automatically , that is , those that do not trigger the automod . 
  nope . 
  a submission showing up on the site does not mean that it has been approved . 
  all it means is that it has not been removed - neither temporarily ( automod ) or completely ( manually deleted ) . 
   like in that case , the first submission got 8 upvotes because it was hidden for first two hours and algorithm pushed it down . 
  when a post gets approved after it has been temporarily removed , it is placed at the top of the `` new '' column . 
  look at the new queue right now - you will see an article about investments in ireland that has been posted 50 + minutes ago ordered as `` newer '' than the article about rachel johnson which has been posted 5 minutes ago . 
  the article has essentially the same chances as if it was posted right before it got approved . 
  the only thing that can change is the time of the day - there are good and less good hours in terms of activity on the sub . 
   i do n't know what your goal is but the way you do things now , you killed that piece of information , preventing it from having a chance to get to the frontpage . 
  not really true . 
  if you look closely , you will see that [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67uqmt/german_lieutenant_arrested_for_alleged_xenophobic/ ) post is actually # 17 on the front page while it was higher earlier .
