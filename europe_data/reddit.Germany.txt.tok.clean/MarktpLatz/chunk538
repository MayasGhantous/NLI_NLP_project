  of course it 's weird as fuck . 
  however , without more knowledge on the specific case , we can not really comment on it . 
  you should probably educate yourself on the issue before making claims like this . 
  again , this was never about refugees already in germany . 
  this was about new arrivals to italy and greece . 
  what exactly do you want to say with this article ? 
  it does not call for other countries to take refugees from germany , hence not contradicting my point . 
  that 's factually wrong . 
  germany never asked anybody in the eu to take refugees from germany and we will not do that in the future either . 
  resettlement was meant to relieve pressure off greece , italy and initially hungary , not from germany . 
   the case highlights that the german bureaucracy is not capable of screening asylum applicants you need to differenciate here . 
  his application was filed at a point where the authorities were completely overwhelmed , shortly after the peak of the refugee arrivals to germany . 
  this does not mean that they are not capable of screening refugees in general . 
  please use / r/europemeta, 
  i think you are underestimating this a bit . 
  we are not talking about regular reddit reports here ( we had those as well ) , we are talking about people actually writing mod mails , addressing moderators in the comments and people creating threads on / r/europemeta . 
  and , quite frankly , they are correct . 
  it is n't healthy when 2/3 of the front page is made up of series posts . 
  agree to disagree i guess then . 
  in germany , `` asylum '' is a higher legal status than `` refugee '' . 
  again - by the government with professional translators . 
  this is n't ... how any of this works . 
  ever heared of the right of privacy ? 
   funnily enough , even openly anti-eu left-wingers like m\u00e9lenchon and so on are less prone to be called populist demagogues here than right-wing eu-sceptics like norbert hofer . 
  i do not know where you live , but m\u00e9lenchon was regularly branded a `` populist '' over here . 
  why should you as an average citizen be able to check that ? 
  who says that left-wing parties can not be populist ? 
  yeah , a part of the left is populist , but parties like the fp\u00d6 are as well . 
  if someone gives a voice sample in the presence of an immigration office , where is the issue ? 
  the total number of applications was 1,322,825 in 2015 and 1,259,955 in 2016 . 
  and well , it is not really that relevant in regard to ops post since you can not put these numbers into relation . 
  many people who came here in 2015 were not able to file their application in 2015 ( germany had 476k applications in 2015 , but the total influx was 890k ) and decisions can be carried out in the next year .

  that 's completely fine . 
  i am simply saying that our picture of eritrea is rather unreliable due to these reasons . 
   plus those 5 % from eritrea , which is about as fucked up as it gets . 
  this is n't entirely clear . 
  the classification of eritra is n't based on actual observations in the country but on questioning of refugees from that country . 
  many diplomats think that the picture presented by the un is worse than the reality in eritrea . 
  there are good reasons to think that eritrea is a legitimate origin for refugees though . 
  the country * is * a shithole . 
  it is merely up for debate how much of a shithole it is .

  [ here you can have a look at the list of decisions in q4 2016 based on citizenship ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/c/c0/first_instance_decisions_by_outcome_and_recognition_rates%2c_30_main_citizenships_of_asylum_applicants_granted_decisions_in_the_eu-28%2c_4th_quarter_2016.png/752px-first_instance_decisions_by_outcome_and_recognition_rates%2c_30_main_citizenships_of_asylum_applicants_granted_decisions_in_the_eu-28%2c_4th_quarter_2016.png ) . 
  germany verifies the mentioned country based on language . 
  it is possible to determine where someone is from ( roughly ) based on dialect and language spoken . 
  inaccurate . 
  this is the number of * applications * , not the number of people being granted asylum . 
   does asylum-seeker = refugee ? 
  i thought they mean two different things . 
  every person who applies for * some * kind of protection is counted as an `` asylum seeker '' . 
  in reality , few of them will actually be granted asylum , most will get a lower status like `` refugee '' .

  `` populist '' is an accurate description though . 
  nobody forces you to frequent this sub ... 
   their recent decline was n't because of anything they did , it 's because the spd 's recent strengthening under schulz made their voters feel that their vote could make a difference if cast for another party , and because their signature topic has faded from the news somewhat . 
  plus they were n't the focus of media attention for the first time in two years . 
   people do n't vote for afd , they vote against something . 
  while i agree with that , it is only an option for the protest votes as long as it does n't go too far regarding some topics . 
  few people voted npd to express that they are `` against '' something in the years before the afd . 
  crime doens n't make an area unsafe for deportations . 
  war does . 
  murderous regimes do . 
  source ? 
  i 'd argue that petry was still `` moderate '' enough to sell this to regular conservative people - this will get harder without her . 
  ferry porsche , the guy who was actually responsible for what we know as porsche today , spent most of his life in stuttgart . 
  maybe that 's what you are thinking about , 
  does french count as a `` foreign language '' for people from flanders ? 
  ferdinand porsche grew up in austria , when he came to germany , he was almost 50 years old . 
  as i said - it depends on the situation in three years . 
  it 's kind of pointless to talk about this right now . 
  additionally , germanys definition of `` safe '' might not be the same as the definition of `` safe '' in sweden . 
  this is up to every country to decide on its own . 
  i think `` it is safe because the conditions there are x '' is a better argument than `` germany deports people to this country too , so it has to be safe '' . 
  depends . 
  sweden does deport criminals , but they do not deport into unsafe areas . 
  it really depends on what afghanistan will look like in three years . 
  honestly , i did n't do australia because i like the `` austria = australia '' jokes ( in fact i find them kind of boring ) . 
  but this is really no reason to be upset . 
  these threads are n't completely serious at all times and shitty jokes happen - so what . 
  i 'm really interested to see the first polls that were conducted after they nominated their new team for the election . 
  actually we did n't ? 
  the last one was australia , but due to the `` australia = austria '' there are some repeats . 
  the other way around - if anything , franconia will separate itself from bavaria in case of bavarian indepence . 
  if this actually happened , bavaria would be more or less en par with austria in terms of population and gdp . 
  the chances of bavaria joining you are lower than you becoming part of bavaria . 
  they have a larger population and a larger economy than you . 
  austro-bavarian federation here we come !, 
  yes . 
  the company that built the leclerc ( nexter ) and the company that built the leopard ii ( kmw ) have formed a joint venture called kant and they will be producing the next mbt for our countries . 
  there is n't anything official yet on the next mbt , but it wo n't be here before 2030 . 
  use / r/askeurope please !,
