   on holocaust memorial day when all of israel is in memorial r/europe posts another anti israeli article . 
  ... this is completely unrelated to the date and your pm is to blame here . 
  nothing `` anti israeli '' about it . 
   and for the record i posted a video and two articles of the idf chief of staff speaking in auswitch and it was removed as ` not european ' by the mods . 
  yet this article got through , ok what are you talking about ? 
  i see only one article about * auschwitz * ( at least spell it right ) in your history and it has n't been removed . 
  removed - duplicate . 
   my point is that they have absolutely no influence , because they are always very badly outnumbered and quickly silenced . 
  disagree . 
  while they might not have that much impact in the comments , the impact on the `` new '' queue is n't to be underestimated . 
  and additionally :  again and again people claim that mysterious putinbots and neo nazis from 4chan are shilling reddit . 
  little success does not contradict that this is happening . 
  i do not say it is a coordinated government effort ( from whatever country ) since this is almost impossible to prove . 
  but there certainly are people who are committed to agenda pushing and they do not hesitate to create multiple accounts to push a narrative ( even if they fail ) and to engage in vote manipulation . 
  thanks !, 
  would you be so kind to provide a translation or at least a short summary ? 
  otherwise this is kind of pointless . 
  from a mod perspective i can attest that new accounts commenting in certain threads ( immigration , eu , etc. ), 
  in a very agenda-pushing way are almost always conservative/right wing . 
  what the community makes of them is a different story . 
  the first amendment protects you from prosecution in he us , nothing more . 
  you could still be tried in european courts for it ( should you come over here ) and it does n't protect reddit comments against deletion .

  i meant the first part . 
  i do not think that our governments are that worried about erdogan . 
  it 's all just talk . 
  i do not think so . 
  holy shit that 's nonsense . 
  no , they run in national elections . 
  is this the thirteenth or already the fourteenth time they threaten this ? 
  nobody takes this threat seriously anymore . 
  happy birthday !,

  disagree . 
  there simply was n't a serious threat for 20 years . 
  the ch-53 had production faults of this kind a decade ago : [ link ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/materialfehler-flugverbot-fuer-hubschrauber-der-bundeswehr-a-290411.html ) . 
  if i recall correctly , production-side faults were blamed according to the * zeit * in an article one or two years ago . 
   the problems with the weapon system ch-53 ( the only us-built helicopter besides the uh-1d ) result from there being no repair parts available anymore . 
  the weapon system itself is unlike the weapon systems tiger and nh-90 field-tested and well established ( your comment applies to the other systems ) . 
  the experts attested that some of the problems are caused by production-side faults . 
  the problem with the ( us-built ) helicopters is that some have material weaknesses . 
  them being out of order right now is simply a security measure . 
  with better management and oversight , you have the potential to get more for less . 
  our military is n't even using its full budget . 
  this comment does n't even make sense . 
  the deterioration of the equipment availability etc. 
  only started after the reuinification as part of a piece dividend . 
  the aircraft availablility is a special case though . 
  jets with an outdated software version are counted as `` not fully fit for service '' . 
  `` many world leaders '' is essentially just the us president , and they go totally mad in this regard . 
  i have never seen anybody wear a kevlar west tho . 
  that line of argumentation is flawed . 
  you could as well say the same about refugee distribution directly from the camps in lebanon . 
  the distribution was meant to get some order into this . 
  prior to the turkey deal , one of the main concerns about greeces neighbors closing the borders was greece being totally overwhelmed . 
  and it also misses the point - the argument is about people ( ex-talibans ) who are in germany . 
  wrong place mate , i am sorry . 
  try either / r/travel or / r/askeurope .

  you are still evading the original topic . 
  german : hector , der ritter ohne furcht und tadel italian : il soldato di ventura english : soldier of fortune, 
  is n't that a bit of a proxy argument though ? 
  we try to hide behind some hypothetic fear of our neighbors when the reality is that we simply do n't want to spend that much because we do not want to / do not see the need to do so . 
  you are n't even capable of challenging what i wrote with facts . 
  resorting to `` fourth reich '' rhetoric is kind of pathetic if you ask me .
