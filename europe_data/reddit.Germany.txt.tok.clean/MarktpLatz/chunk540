   well , yes - but does it work ? 
  the experiences with full decriminalization in portugal tell me no . 
   learned that it 's not the potential to cause an addiction ( we do n't want to ban cigarettes ) what makes the substance illegal i think this is a bit of a flawed argument . 
  were cigarettes invented today , i am somewhat confident they would be banned . 
  it 's just difficult to ban something that has a long history and high popularity in the society ( admittedly , the `` high popularity '' argument is getting less and less valid every day ) .

  this is not about asylum seekers from germany . 
  the redistribution scheme was meant to distribute refugees from greece , italy and originally hungary ( they declined ) . 
  germany never even attempted to do this with people already inside our country . 
  i hope you have a good time over here !, 
  this is not how it works though . 
  the law does not differenciate between the mindsets of people . 
  all that matters is whether it is safe there for them or not . 
  that 's the only criteria . 
  germany has never asked other countries to take refugees from germany and no redistribution scheme was ever meant to do this . 
  edit : instead of downvoting , you could try to challenge my argument . 
  the controversy is not about deporting people in general , the controversy is about whether afghanistan can be considered a `` safe country '' . 
  the argument is this : when our foreign minister only dares to run around in a [ kevlar west ] ( http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-890455-860_galleryfree-tgsp-890455.jpg ) in afghanistan , how can you deem it safe for the people sent back . 
  not sharing my personal opinion , just giving a bit of background . 
  no worries , 
  wrong thread . 
  use the link to ask questions . 
  this thread is for japanese people asking questions to us . 
  generally speaking , this is accurate . 
  there are no phsyical borders between the european countries anymore . 
  however , some countries have reintroduced border checks due to the refugee crisis and terrorism . 
  so it might be useful to have your passport at hand when you are crossing the borders . 
  if this happens , they will just cotrol your passport though , no big check . 
  i personally do not smoke cannabis but i am in favour of full legalization . 
  it is not that harmful ( alcohol is much worse ) , it has medical use and the police and the courts have to spend a lot of time on it that would be much better spent on other crime fighting . 
  additionally , legalization allows the state to tax this stuff . 
   could someone tell me about immigration in schengen area ? 
  what exactly do you want to know ? 
  about getting into schengen ? 
  about travelling between schengen countries ? 
  about the state of refugee migration in schengen ? 
  t_d is actually worse than any other subreddit i know in terms of modding . 
  they claim to be pro free speech , but they are only interested in creating a giant circlejerk . 
  and no , the opinion that you say `` make the mods uncomfortable '' - usually it 's people that are getting pissed because we ( and other subs ) do not allow white supremacist rheroric and blatant racism . 
  unfortunately i 'm on mobile . 
  but in recent years , germany has been the second most popular destination for immigrants worldwide , after the us . 
  you could mention the refugee crisis , even though nobody knows what the long term effects of this will be . 
  additionally , one could consider that germany has become a very popular destination for regular , legal migration in recent years . 
  the scenarios calculated with a lower general migration rate towards germany . 
  these predictions are no longer valid . 
  this data was calculated prior to brexit and some other events . 
  brexit might have unforseen consequences on the migration to the uk , which the predicted increase is mainly based on ( the fertility rate in britain is below reproduction level ) .

   if you have one constituency , then you should have the same for other districts . 
  for instance , i am french abroad not living in northern europe , would love to hear about proposals for other districts . 
  we can not have an ama for every single district . 
   in the spirit of fairness , other parties should also be allowed to post ama here . 
  they are . 
   3 % are not that much . 
  usually i would agree , but not in this case . 
  3 % could be the difference between making it to the second round and coming third . 
   if this year is like the years before , then the chance of macron-le pen 2nd round with a macron victory is quiet high . 
  depends on whether the attack yesterday will have an impact on the actual results . 
  polls can not predict that so close to an election . 
  the fn is n't really a new phenomen in france and the polling agencies had time to adapt . 
  le pen outperformed her polls by around 2 % in the last election . 
  [ list of polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2012 ) . 
  in the last legislative election , the fn actually performed [ worse than the polls predicted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_legislative_election,_2012 ) . 
  the problem is that a non-sticky will not recieve enough upvotes to get it to the front page . 
  which means that directing these posts to such a megathread will equal deleting them as nobody is going to notice . 
  we have tried that in the last few days and it worked quite alright . 
  however , we are constantly facing the problem that we only have two sticky slots . 
  both of the current stickies are important . 
  we are currently working on a solution that does n't require megathreads while not killing the posts completely at the same time however .

  the way the countries decide depends on what the countries want/the legal situation in said countries . 
  germany for example wo n't have a referendum as we do not know referendums on the federal level .

   glad to know that you 've got tools to prevent vote manipulation , i was n't aware of that . 
  it 's essentially using reddit as a basis and only allows accounts over a certain age with at least a certain amount of karma on / r/europe to participate . 
  the response is then anonymously linked to the reddit account to prevent accounts from participating multiple times . 
   i 'm sure we could wait a bit for the guy who is on vacation to return . 
  hope he has a good trip .
