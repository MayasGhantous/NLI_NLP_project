  yeah , 
  i 'll bring it up internally . 
  maybe we can use the tools we used for our last subscriber survey . 
  this would allow us to prevent vote manipulation . 
  unfortunately , our guy who created it is on vacation currently . 
  we are not entirely opposed to polls . 
  we simply dislike strawpolls and polls held without our approval in general .

  in this case - yes . 
  that would create a very bad precedent and it would piss off the country with the largest oil reserves in africa . 
  this has no legal basis and in fact contradicts maritime law .

  not really , no . 
  the current numbers are n't anywhere close to the level that would be required to even talk about collapse . 
  the numbers are better than nobody getting into work and there is precedent for refugees leaving . 
  again , does n't work . 
  the numbers are too high . 
  not really no . 
  yes . 
  schengen is n't the problem in this regard . 
  the point of the australian solution is that they can not apply for asylum . 
  well , they could on a greek island . 
  greek laws apply there . 
  greece already does n't have schengen land borders - did n't really change much about the refugee situation . 
  this article is one year old ...

  not anymore . 
  does n't work . 
  this would be essentially the same and a violation of their territorial integrity . 
  the most problematic country is n't tunisia or egypt , it is libya . 
  and the libyan government does n't have control over its full territory or its coast at the moment . 
  this would prove to be very problematic . 
  we can not do much until peace and order is restored in libya . 
  let me point you to some numbers from the first major representative polling of refugees by our federal agency for employment : at the time of the survey ( june-oct 2016 ) , 14 % of refugees were employed . 
  out of those , 32 % were working full-time , 21 % as part-time employees , 24 % were currently in an internship or in vocational training . 
  employment shares were 9 % for those who arrived here in 2015 , 22 % for those from 2014 and 31 % for those from 2013 and before . 
  according to this data , the report states , the development of their employment is exactly in line with the integration into the labour market of refugees in the past . 
  another stat : amongst those that do not have a job currently , 78 % are very sure that they want to have a job and 15 % `` probably '' want a job ( 97 % of men and 85 % of women with a positive answer ) . 
  [ source , unfortunately only available in german ] ( http://doku.iab.de/kurzber/2016/kb2416.pdf ) -- -- -- i guess time will tell . 
  there are a lot of factors playing into this that are uncertain at this moment , but if there is one country in europe that can mange this , it is germany . 
  mainly because we are near full-employment anyways and because we have the budget leeway and the politcal stability to make this work . 
  we have already tried to persuade them , to no avail . 
   good argument , but you are still spending already created capital , meaning , the money `` flowing back '' is already created wealth that you are merely spending within your economy . 
  it 's a bit more complicated than that . 
  first of all , spending capital here is better than spending capital abroad . 
  additionally , you have to consider the german budget mentality . 
  additional money would n't be used for investment ( unfortunately ) but for paying off the debt , essentially pulling the money out of the economic cycle in germany ( some of it might go to german investors , but that 's pretty vague ) . 
  anyways , i do not want to make a point that this is a reason to have refugees . 
  i am simply comparing the use of that money - and it is better to use it domesticlally than abroad . 
  for long-term consequences , it is a bit more complicated . 
  we do not know how long said conflicts will last , when people will be able to return and whether their contribution to the general budget will be positive ( speaking long-term ) . 
   there is very little chance that any significant number of them will find long term employment , not to mention that the flow has n't stopped , they are still coming . 
  actually the chances are n't that bad . 
  the federal agency for employment estimates 50 % after 5 years , 70 % after 15 years . 
  the article is more than a year old .

  the calculation was made while people were still expecting more refugees for 2016 than actually came . 
  but whatever . 
  in the recent few years , about 1.6 million people applied for asylum in germany . 
  let 's assume we would house all of them in camps of this kind , at 1,000 $ per month , ignoring the extra payments . 
  that would cost us * more * than 90 billions over the same period of time . 
  the money also is n't flowing back into the economy ( like the domestic spending on refugee is ) and there is zero chance of any of them ever making a contribution that could balance out the costs . 
   its merkel that invited them and its europe that refuses to close borders . 
  [ nope ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ) . 
   if eu wanted to , borders could be closed completely . 
  wrong .

  that 's not the australian system however . 
  the australian system aims at preventing that they can apply for asylum in the first place . 
  and about `` way home '' - here is the issue with this : the number of people coming here that are hard to send back is n't exactly small , mainly caused by two things : people do n't having the appropriate documents and their governments refusing to take them back . 
  the first thing is problematic when you put them all on the island as they would need to get to an embassy of their home country to request new documents . 
  you can see why this is problematic . 
  it is not only expensive to ferry these people around for every trip of this kind ( applying for a new passport can take multiple visits to the embassy ) , you would also have to guard them to ensure that they do not `` disappear '' . 
  there is n't much we can do about countries not taking back their citizens , we can not force them to do so . 
  we can only exercise pressure . 
  as a result , at a certain point the number of people on these islands would get too large . 
  the best way to reduce the flows ( it is n't possible to stop them completely ) is to ensure that the northern african states have control over their whole territory and have them secure their coasts . 
  it did work prior to the arab spring . 
  the problem is that this might need major involvement of our militaries .
