  there is a recording of a talk between mannerheim and hitler which is the only known recording of hitler talking hin a normal voice . 
  [ youtube link with subtitles if anyone is interested ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oet1wag5sfk ) . 
  we have already asked tunisia to host refugee camps on their mainland and they said no . 
  they do not want to be the hotspot to return refugees to . 
  those are eu soil and thus not suited if you are looking for an `` australian solution '' . 
  the whole point of that scheme is that these islands are * not * australia . 
  this misses the point . 
  the islands are eu soil which makes using them totally pointless if you are looking for an `` australian solution '' . 
  all of these islands are eu soil which would mean that they are entitled to apply for asylum there . 
  plus it is n't realistic to have hundred thousands of people on small islands . 
   were n't there some talks with tunisia ? 
  about building those detention centers on some spots of land tunisia does n't need much ? 
  tunisia said no . 
  as did egypt . 
  we can do that with the government of unity as well . 
  it 's just that nobody want 's to put boots on the ground in libya . 
  op wrote `` austria took the most per capita in 2015 '' . 
  i actually do n't really want to argue about this . 
  i think we can all agree that germany , austria and sweden took * a lot * of refugees , more than anybody could ever expect them to take . 
  it is kind of pointless to argue about `` who got most '' in this context . 
  why do you ask me ? 
  i am just outlining that austria does n't have a good proposal either despite talking a lot . 
  this does n't help us in any way to `` fix '' this . 
  you are claiming that there is some kind of miraculous proposal that would solve all this - this is not the case . 
  if there was such a way , there would be a country bringing it forwards . 
  hungary does n't give a shit was the other governments think in this regard and it does n't give a shit about ngos . 
  and no , the australian situation is different . 
  they never had comparable numbers to begin with . 
  again , that does n't change anything for the current day . 
  origins are diverse , but the solution is n't affected by the source of these movements . 
  op talked about 2015 however . 
  and in 2015 , germany , sweden and hungary saw more refugee arrivals per capita . 
  for 2016 , there are other countries with more applications per capita than austria . 
  this is n't something we can change now and it is n't like gaddafi was ousted by western forces alone . 
  once more , austria has n't even be able to put a realistic proposal to the table . 
  the funding is quite another thing , but they did not even get to the state where funding becomes an issue . 
  again , this does n't work due to a multitude of reasons . 
  austria has repeatedly talked about australia-like solutions in the past and they never managed to propose anything concrete . 
  simply because it does not work here . 
   we can put them in french guiana you want to ferry refugees halfway around the world ? 
  that 's surely gon na be a cheap and efficient solution . 
  additionally , the people of french guiana would not be happy to have more refugees than inhabitants all the sudden . 
   or build a floating detention facility . 
  a floating detention facility that has the capacity to take tens of thousands of people at once ? 
  this is unheard of . 
  again , austria talks big about solutions here , but they do not have any concrete proposals either . 
  `` close the mediterranean '' is n't a good concept if you can not tell us how to do it . 
  [ is it ? 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/22/australia-has-paid-nauru-29m-in-visa-fees-to-keep-asylum-seekers-in-detention ), 
  your original claim was `` they took the most refugees per capita in 2016 '' - false , they did n't . 
  this is what the document / r/contec linked proved . 
  your secondary claim was that you meant 2015 where they took the most per capita - which has been debunked by my numbers . 
  you ca n't . 
  the situations are not comparable . 
  not in terms of geography , not in terms of size and not in terms of legal situation . 
  you can not find something ... that simply is n't there . 
  unless someone has a solid proposal , this is all just talk . 
  why would i ? 
  your claim about 2015 is inaccurate . 
  and so is your original claim , as / u/contec proved . 
  the problem is n't who rules - the problem is that nobody in libya has full control over the whole country . 
  even if there was some general that tried to become a dictator over there - he would only control half the country . 
  that 's ... 2016 again and does n't contradict what i wrote in any way . 
  germany also took more - eurostat only lists the applications while a lot of people were n't able to apply in 2015 due to the authorities being overwhelmed . 
  the total number for 2015 was 890,000 . 
  we do not have an island comparable , it has been proven to be extremely expensive and the northern african states do not want camps of this kind on their soil . 
  this only leaves european countries as locations and eu law plus the regular asylum laws of that country will apply . 
  this is only actual applications which does n't show the full picture . 
  germany had more arrivals per capita in 2015 . 
  austria had one refugee for every 96.12 citizens ( 88,160 / 8,474,000 ) while germany had one refugee for every 91,24 citizens ( 890,000 / 81,200,000 ) . 
  the reason why your source talks about austria taking the most people is that german authorities were totally overwhelmed and a lot of the applications from people who arrived here in 2015 were made/accepted/dealt with in 2016 . 
  additionally , the article is simply inaccurate . 
  hungary ( one refugee per 55,5 inhabitants , 177,135 / 9,830,485 ) and sweden ( one refugee per 60.8 inhabitants , 162,450 / 9.875.378 ) took more people per capita . 
  you get upset by stuff like this ? 
  from a todays perspective or from the perspective of the people of that time ? 
  what matters is the situation now . 
  there is no reason to distrust sch\u00e4uble today imo . 
  you can disagree with his politics , of course , but i think it is not realistic that sch\u00e4uble would do something of this kind again . 
  he has paid a price for that . 
  source ? 
  i doubt that .

  i do n't think so . 
  through polls . 
  regular polling questions are `` what party would you vote for if the election was next sunday ? '', 
  electoral potential is measured with the question `` would you consider voting for party x in the next federal election ? '' . 
  [ this survey for example lists them at 24 % ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/umfragen-analysen/bundesweit/umfragen/aktuell/hohe-akzeptanz-fuer-anti-euro-kurs-umfrage-zur-alternative-fuer-deutschland/ ) in 2013 , just as an example of how it works . 
  the hell ? 
  not gon na happen . 
  it is either afd or not afd today .
