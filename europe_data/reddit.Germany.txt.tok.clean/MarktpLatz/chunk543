  there wo n't be a second appearance of the nsdap as a popular party . 
  we have lived the last two decades without a proper right-wing party . 
  the npd rarely managed to get more than 2 % on the federal level and it did n't do us any harm . 
  already did a translation , do n't worry , 
  translation : afd leader petry does n't want to become a leading candidate of her party for the bundestag election . 
  in a video message , she declared that she is `` not available as a sole top candidate or as part of a team of top candidates for the upcoming federal election '' . 
  petry argued that `` increasing internal tensions '' within the afd were her reasoning , which also resulted in a decreasing electoral potential . 
  while that potential was at 30 % in 2015 , it has since decreased to a mere 14 % . 
  the afd boss emphasized that she never actively sought to be be the top candidate of her party - contrary to her peers in the federal party leadership , she was the only one who never took position on this . 
  petry talked about public speculation without internal coordination amongst party members . 
  petry says that this style of going about is `` destroying trust '' since the party appears disunited . 
  a development that `` colleagues have repeadedly accepted since 2016 '' . 
  petry announced her decision three days before the afd party congress in cologne where the party seeks to determine the program for the upcoming bundestag election . 
  ... from the afd . 
  correct . 
  if she takes the `` moderates '' with her , i am totally happy about that . 
  every percent less for the afd is good . 
  meuthen is far more rightwing than people tend to believe and he is n't an option . 
  he has said in the past that he wants to stay leader of the afd parliamentary group in the bw state assembly and he is n't even running for bundestag . 
   i do n't think she is abandoning the party for political , but for personal reasons ( pregnancy ) . 
  disagree . 
  she wanted to become sole frontrunner despite her pregnancy . 
   the more interesting question is who is going to replace her as frontrunner , as someone from the right wing replacing her would probably mean the end of the party . 
  it is either someone unknown or someone from the right . 
  neither option is good for the afd .

  no worries  we are tryting to prevent the front page from being flooded . 
  the front page consisting of 70 % posts of '' [ x ] of europe '' is no fun either . 
  i think allowing the first handful of posts posts and then directing new posts into a megathread is the best way to go .

  it is not about gifting in good faith . 
  it is about the potential that someone might use this to spy on the person it has been gifted to . 
  how do you do that ? 
  if you get gifted a doll for your child , you are not going to check it for potentially harmful spying devices , are you ? 
   the fact that they are forcing people to destroy their property . 
  the doll should n't have been sold in the first place . 
  the issue is that tools of this kind can be used to spy on other people who do not know about the nature of the device . 
  making them illegal is n't exactly outlandish . 
  what freedoms are we restricting exactly ? 
  this particular case is based on a law that has been in effect for quite a while now .

  exactly . 
  this is how it is supposed to work . 
  very few countries actually pay back debt . 
  nope . 
  deutsche bank had 238 millions exposure to greece , commerzbank around 400 millions as of 2015 . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-banking-exposure-iduskbn0ke16h20150106 ), 
  i think the number usually mentioned in this regard is a total maturity of 50 years if i am not mistaken . 
  some of the airports are actually profitable , which caused quite a bit of opposition from your side . 
  and additionally , it is n't forever - it 's `` just '' a lease for 40 years . 
  there is n't a reliable way to know that . 
  but i do not think that a mere extension by 20 years or something similar would be shut down by the courts . 
  there is a lot of room for interpretation . 
  if the current deals are n't illegal ( which they arent , following repeated judgements by the courts ) , why would deals that just do more of the same be different . 
   i do n't know , you seem better informed - who deals with eu treaty violations ?
