  anyone can . 
  since the established taxi drivers actually have to follow the rules * and * at the same time generate profit ( unlike uber ) , they can not compete with uber . 
  it just is n't possible .

  the loans are not short term and in the case of default , greece would pretty much collapse . 
  all the austerity in recent years would be nothing compared to a full-on default . 
  of course they can . 
  it would fuck them royally however . 
  are you talking debt or debt ratio ? 
  having a higher total debt does n't matter as the economy grows significantly over time . 
   the airports are mostly in decent shape i think three of them are actually ranked amongst the ten worst airports of europe . 
  experts around the world agree that the debt of greece is unsustainable without debt relief . 
   first of all , u have the tone of - i-am-inside-schaubles-mind - which is silly . 
  you just comment your opinion . 
  it is actually what sch\u00e4uble has said in the past . 
   my opinion is the imf delivers at germanys government a very , very good card : many times it allows them to bypass bundestag . 
  how ? 
   which means that greece cant get involved in germanys political talk and its just what schauble and merkel says . 
  i am not saying its the only thing imf delivers to the arrangements , i am saying this is perhaps the most major reason . 
  not really , no .

  what the imf said is economically sound . 
  it is unrelated to political pressue . 
  which is what matters . 
  sch\u00e4uble & co. are well aware that there is a need for debt relief for greece , it 's just hard to sell to the german electorate . 
  this is why we will not see any nominal debt relief and not before the election . 
  despite the stance of the imf , they are firm believers in structural reform , which is closer to our own stance than for example the stance of france . 
  the statistics are misleading at best and i still do not know how he gets to 4 bn $ in interest and fees . 
  the data sheet linked says something else . 
  i still do not understand the point of this article . 
  it is blaming the imf for random stuff and makes ridiculous allegations . 
  ignoring for example that the imf is greeces most powerful `` friend '' when it comes to debt relief . 
  how could they ? 
  the imf is n't buying your former state-run enterprises .

  what a bullshit article . 
   the ec , especially germany , enlisted the imf to act as a foil for any failed policies , arguably smart political insurance . 
  actually , the main reason for germany to get the imf on board is that it believed that the imf would be less affected by political influence from greece . 
  it was ( and is ) seen as pillar that ensures a rather tough stance on greece . 
   as the political foil , the imf was provided with a cash cow to milk given greece 's situation , describing them as a `` cash cow '' is a bit ironic , is n't it ? 
   greece has paid almost $ 4 billion in fees and interest to the imf since the start of the programme . 
  i really do not understand how he can get to 4 billions . 
   greece payments are so important to the imf that they were 118 % of imf 's operating profit . 
  that 's not really a valid comparison . 
   since 2010 , imf personnel expense have increased 48 % compared to a decline of 8 % in the prior seven years . 
  and , not to go unnoticed , the imf newly refurbished headquarters is 31 % over budget at $ 562 million . 
  that 's some baseless allegation . 
   with 97 % of imf 's cost now essentially fixed , losing greece , portugal , and ireland , would cause massive financial trauma at the imf and may well render it insolvent . 
  so , the obvious question is : does the imf have an incentive to keep greece in crisis to protect its own financial survival and continue to milk the greek cow ? 
  holy shit that 's nonsense . 
  the imf does not rely on interest payments from greece to continue existing . 
  if course it is . 
  but the . com domain is irrelevant in this regard as well . 
  does n't change the validity of my statement . 
  there are entities that have no business activities in the us with a . com domain . 
  it is n't any more . 
  it used to be a domain for us-based commercial operations , nowadays companies from all over the world use it .

  wrong place mate . 
  disagree . 
  we do not want to get rid of these posts completely . 
  we do not want this to turn into a news-only subreddit . 
  well , we sometimes have these big trees as well , but these comment do n't get deleted because we simply dislike them or disagree with them but because they are hate speech or personal attacks etc. 
  well , why would i ? 
  transparency is the key and i stand by what i am saying . 
  if people think that they have to downvote me for it , so be it . 
  thanks for the kind words . 
  that 's not the point . 
  there is a difference between the term `` muslim '' and `` islamist '' - incorrectly translating islamist with muslim is in conflict with our `` no editorialization '' rule .
