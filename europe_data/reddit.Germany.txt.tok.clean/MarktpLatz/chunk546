  alright , reinstated . 
  again , i am not talking about a full-scale eu army , i am talking about enhanced cooperation .

  spains level in 2012 was worse than italy now and themir balance was cut im half within a little more than two years . 
  hence why i am mainly talking about cooperation . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  target 2 balances can change significantly due to various reasons . 
  and well , everyone knows that brexit will happen , but i would argue that the market values are n't entirely representative for the long term situation - the markets do n't know either what will happen . 
  nobody knows what brexit will look like in the end though . 
  not really , no .

  ireland is a much less significant voice in europe than the uk and we are talking deeper integration here , not about a full-scale eu army under the control of some eu institution . 
  please use the megathread for posts of this kind if you have any questions about this removal , please [ contact the mods ] ( / message/compose / ? to = / r/europe & subject = moderation ) . 
  that 's not what happened though . 
  the uk has opposed closer cooperation . 
  [ look here for example ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/08/european-union-plans-military-battlegroups-after-brexit-vote ) . 
  it has n't been the only obstacle , but the most vocal and powerful opposing voice . 
  europe is moving towards closer military cooperation no matter what , nato or not . 
  the main obstacle so far has n't been nato , it was the uk . 
  i quoted oxford . 
  not my own words . 
  this wo n't lead to anything . 
  when it comes to monetary claims , this could work as they could seize german property in the us . 
  for this - not a chance . 
  we will not allow us courts to judge on matters that fall out of their jurisdiction . 
  if you try to harm other people because of your faith , be it physcially or by simply subjugating other people to follow the exact words of your religion , that 's kind of perverted .

  the no-fun axis ? 
  blame the italian who did this megathread !, 
  fully agree . 
  we might have been a bit late on this , but do n't forget that we are all volunteers . 
  we can not monitor everything all the time . 
   can we limit this sort of chain posting , at least for specific types of content ? 
  like no chain posts that contain only images . 
  i think that would go a long way towards making the front page more information-rich . 
  we are still looking for the best way possible to deal with these posts . 
  a way that is n't overly restrictive while at the same time preventing lower quality posts from flooding the front page . 
   that 's what i am saying - changing the subreddit quality guidelines changes the readership . 
  if you publish empty jokes and pictures of actors across the whole front page , the readers you will get will be the those who want to consume this crap . 
  we will not completely abandon fun or picture posts . 
  we are n't / r/newsofeurope . 
   ultimately , choosing the direction of the subreddit is the job of the moderators , and they are failing at that . 
  not really . 
  what content is posted here - as long as it is okay by the rules - is up to the users . 
  please use the megathread for posts of this kind if you have any questions about this removal , please [ contact the mods ] ( / message/compose / ? to = / r/europe & subject = moderation ) . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  i think people who take any religious document literally ( and there are christians who take the bible literally ) are ridiculous and under certain circumstances potentially dangerous . 
   i am not going to comment any more on this , or both of us we 'll probably be kicked to / r/europemeta it 's alright . 
   well , if you permit 90 % of the posts on the front page to be meme-type crap , you will soon have no readers to bring anything to this site . 
  the problem is this : at the point where the posts are approved ( they do not need to be approved to be visible by the way ) , maybe one of them is on the front page . 
  we have to predict whether the other posts make it to the front page . 
  if we act too early , people will say `` what is this about , the posts were n't even bothering us '' . 
  if we act too late , the front page will be flooded . 
  we do not like to make a megathread for every `` x of europe '' trend . 
   i am pretty sure the audience for any type of media , reddit included , are the readers . 
  not the posters/submitters . 
  i meant right , sorry . 
  you are of course right . 
  corrected the comment above . 
  in a literal meaning , no problem , it somewhat is . 
  the same is true for the bible . 
   is there really a difference in lexical meaning yes . 
  let me give you the oxford dictionary definition : ** muslim : ** * a follower of the religion of islam . 
  * ** islamist : ** * an advocate or supporter of islamic militancy or fundamentalism *, 
  that 's a bit tricky . 
  generally you are right . 
  but things will be alright again in a few hours . 
  do n't forget that it is said readers who bring this stuff to the front page in the first place . 
  we still do not offer on-site filters as they still do not work properly , but you can set filters of this kind yourself : [ click here to learn how ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/filter_keywords ) . 
  we are already trying our best to tag posts this way . 
   not all islamists are terrorists though , most are quite peaceful , and do act in the spirit of islam . 
  well , true . 
  you could argue that a fundamentalist approach on any kind of religion is somewhat perverted though . 
  again , it is not about how accurate a headline is , it is about the no editorialization rule . 
  this is a very borderline case . 
  well , it is n't an accurate representation of the original title . 
  that 's what this is about . 
  please use the megathread for posts of this kind if you have any questions about this removal , please [ contact the mods ] ( / message/compose / ? to = / r/europe & subject = moderation ) . 
   but i realise now that ` moslem ' is a follower of islam and ` islamist ' someone who ( ab - ) uses islam for political purposes . 
  exactly . 
  however , it is not entirely wrong , as islamists are still muslims , just with a very perverted understanding of their faith . 
   feel free to edit the title . 
  we unfortunatly can not do that . 
  mods do not have this power . 
   but then it got a little out of hand this is why we can not have nice things . 
  posts of this kind are perfectly fine , but every time people overdo it . 
  too many people thinking they just have * one more post everyone has to see * and of course those who are just in for the cheap karma . 
  we deleted posts from the last hour and we delete all new posts . 
  it would be a bit unjust to delete posts with dozens of comments from the front page . 
  no worries , 
  uhm . 
  why did you write `` muslim '' in the title then ? 
  thanks !,
