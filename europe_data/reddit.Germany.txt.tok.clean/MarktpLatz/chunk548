  # united kingdom general election 2017 thursday , june 8th 2017 -- -- -- ** why are we here ? 
  ** -- following the regular election schedule , the next general election for the uk would have happened in 2020 . 
  the [ last election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_2015 ) happened in 2015 , with [ david cameron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_cameron ) and the conservative party winning a majority and forming a government afterwards . 
  cameron stepped down after brexit and was succeeded by home secretary theresa may , who has served as pm since june 11th 2016 . 
  after ruling out snap elections [ five times ] ( https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/five-times-theresa-may-no-10-ruled-snap-general-election/ ) , she announced her intent to hold a snap election on april 18 , which was [ approved with an overwhelming majority ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-mps-approve-vote-theresa-may-snap-plans-parliament-8-june-a7690486.html ) in the house of commons shortly after . 
  may 's intent is to reach a strong mandate for the brexit negotiations . 
  -- -- -- ** electoral system ** -- the voting system being used is first past the post . 
  there are 650 constituents , each electing a single member of parliament . 
  in order to reach an effective majority , the parties need 323 , because one party ( sinn fein ) refuse to tape up their seats in parliament , and the speaker and the deputy speaker do n't vote on legislation . 
  -- -- -- ** parties ** -- *** conservatives *** : the uk 's oldest surviging political party . 
  notable figures including winston churchil , margaret thatcher and the current prime minister theresa may . 
  they are one of the most heavily in favour of austerity , tax cuts and against government borrowing . 
  they proposed to balance the budget by 2025 , raise spending on the nhs by # 8bn per year and on schools by # 4bn per year by 2022 . 
  the conservative party sits with the [ european conservatives and reformists party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_conservatives_and_reformists ) in the european parliament . 
  prior to 2008 , the british conservative party sat with the [ european people 's party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_people%27s_party ) , which is shared by the french ump ( fillon 's party ) , german cdu ( merkel 's party ) and european commission president jean-claude juncker . 
  they left because the epp was too pro-european in their view . 
  *** labour *** : has been one of the uk 's two main political parties ever since the second world war . 
  notable figures include clement attlee and tony blair . 
  the current leader is jeremy corbyn . 
  since corbyn was elected to head labour , the party narrative has shifted significantly to the left . 
  their campaign is focussed on increased public spending , arguing that many services are currently underfunded . 
  they seek to renationalize the national grid , the railways and the royal mail . 
  labour advocates for a `` softer '' brexit than the tories , with a stated goal to retain benefits of the single market and the customs union . 
  the labour party sits with the [ progressive alliance of socialists and democrats ( s&d ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressive_alliance_of_socialists_and_democrats ) in the european parliament . 
  *** liberal democrats *** : the lib dems were created in 1988 by a merger of the uk 's liberal party and the social democratic party . 
  notable figures include wwi british prime minister david lloyd george and nick clegg , who served as deputy prime minister under cameron until the 2015 election .
