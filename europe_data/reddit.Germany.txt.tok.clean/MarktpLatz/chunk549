  the liberal democrats had not been part of a uk government since the party was created , until 2010 , where they coalitioned with the conservative party . 
  this led to them retract many of their party 's pledges , most notably pledging to abolish tuition fees , which has tainted the party 's image ever since . 
  they are the uk 's most pro-european party and campaigned on adopting the euro and ditching the pound as late as the 2005 general election . 
  their econmic policies have been described as ` cut less than the conservatives , but borrow less than labour '' . 
  in the current election , they are promising a second referendum on the final brexit deal , increased spending on education and taking 50,000 refugees from syria . 
  they sit with the [ alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ( alde ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe ) in the european parliament , whose leader is guy verhofstadt . 
  *** ukip *** : the united kingdom indepdence party has shocked the political establishment by going from 3 % of the national vote share in the 2010 election , to a 12.7 % in 2015 , albeit only winning a single seat due to the election system . 
  since the british populace voted in favour of brexit , where ukip polled at over 15 % , they have been in a steady decline , current polls see them below 5 % . 
  despite reaching their main policy goal - pulling the uk out of the eu - they continue to compete in the elections , diversifying their political topics . 
  their leader is paul nuttal , however , ukip is still closely connected to nigel farage who has led the party between 2010 and 2016 . 
  their main campaign promise is to bring net migration to the uk to zero within five years . 
  they sit with [ europe of freedom and direct democracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_freedom_and_direct_democracy ) in the european parliament , along with the italian five star movement and the sweden democrats . 
  *** greens *** : the green party of england and wales has the typical development of a european green party , becoming a formal political party in the late 1980s . 
  the current leaders are caroline lucas and jonathan bartley , and the party has one mp ( caroline lucas ) . 
  the party is popular amongst young and first time voters , but is increasingly winning votes from long time members of the labour , who believe the labour party has become too right wing . 
  the party 's core policies are a 60 % top rate of tax ( as opposed to the current 45 % rate ) , an end to austerity and phasing out all coal and nuclear power stations by 2023 . 
  the party sits with the [ greens european free alliance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_greens%e2%80%93european_free_alliance ) in the european parliament , along with two other uk parties , the scottish nationalists and plaid cymru ( the party of wales ) . 
  most green parties from across europe sit with the gefa , as do the belgian and german pirate parties . 
  *** scottish national party *** : the snp has seen a major boost in voting results in the recent decades , winning 56 out of 59 constituencies in scotland in the 2015 general election , and they have led the government in the scottish parliament since 2011 . 
  a majority of scottish voters voted against brexit last year and snp leader nicola sturgeon has vowed to hold a second independence referendum for scotland due to the outcome of brexit . 
  the party is campaigning for an end to austerity . 
  the snp as well as the scottish generally are seen as being more favourable to the eu than the uk at large . 
  the snp sits with sit the green european free alliance in the european parliament , mentioned above in the paragraph on the green party .

  hey guys , as some of you might remember , we have had [ open mod applications ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a7sxv/open_moderator_applications/dhcw01k/ ) a while back . 
  after a lot of internal deliberation and six rounds of voting ( sorry team ) , we have come up with a list of suitable candidates . 
  as we have announced back then , we will not add all suitable candidates at once but instead add them over time to ensure a smooth process and onboarding . 
  so if you applied and are n't featured in this thread , do n't be upset , it is very possible that we will add you at a later point . 
  -- -- -- for now , we have decided to add three new mods : # / u/blackfire853 / r/polandball mod from the lovely republic of ireland . 
  we believe he is a good fit for our team due to his experience and his overall attitude . 
  # / u/canadianman22 as the name already indicates , from canada . 
  he will join our fellow / u/must _ warn_others to provide better mod coverage of the na timezones . 
  he has been a frequent poster and respected member of our community for a while now and he also mods / r/ontario . 
  # / u/loulan loulan should be well-known to most of you . 
  he is responsible for every second trend that occurs on this sub . 
  he will fill our `` french mod '' slot which has been vacant for a while now . 
  also mods / r/paris . 
  -- -- -- some of you might have already noticed , we have already added one more mod a while ago : # / u/badblueboy146 badblueboy is from croatia and speaks croatian , bosnian , serbian & montenegrin . 
  he has been around in our sub for a long time and given that we regularly have balkan-related topics and that discussions about these matters can get very heated , we consider it very important to have mods from different countries of that region .
