  i think finland and the eastern block has a harder stance . 
  maybe also the dutch . 
  sounds harsh , but there is no better answer . 
  the other option is a default . 
  put the poll again and say nai or grexit and you will get a yes . 
  and then we will reopen the case in 30 years ( hopefully not ) . 
  i suppose the t-bills are mainly held by greek banks and pension funds . 
  companies can not always hope for a ` fair ' process , there will always be some bias . 
  this especially applies to jury systems and yes , even in developed states . 
  check loewen v. united states for example . 
  isds does not grant additional rights to the companies , it is not like they suddenly have rights nobody else has . 
  they are naturally in a disadvantage compared to national companies because their influence on politics is slimmer and they will usually not be protected by politicians . 
  only 10 % of the isds cases are directly against legislation ( and they are hardly ever successful ) . 
  90 % of the cases are against direct goverment execution , usually because the government treated a domestic company better than a foreign one . 
  cases against developed eu states are pretty rare and the success rate of these countries is extraordinary high . 
  there have only been three cases so far against germany ( none has been successful so far , however they settled some ) . 
  there were about 15 cases against the us , they didnt lose a single one as far as i am concerned . 
  before mechanisms like isds , if a party was mistreated it had to rely on its own government to pressure the other state to compensate the company . 
  it often resulted in diplomatic problems , one variation of pursuing such claims was gunboat policy . 
  i would write more on it but i am tired as fuck and i have to give a presentation at the university tomorrow morning . 
  edit : but i am gon na leave this [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2srn0u/trade_secrets_why_will_no_one_answer_the_obvious/cnsffwo ) here . 
  its quite a good read . 
  companies being able to sue governments is nothing new , it has been practiced for decades . 
  if not for the public debate , they would probably have implemented it without any company pushing for it . 
  @duncanweldon  ca n't emphasise enough : 1 . 
  debt level is a long term problem for greece . 
  in the short term interest costs are v low . 
  1/2  trading medium to long term debt relief for short term fiscal tightening when the economy is weak will hurt . 
  2/2 what do you mean by restructuring of that 8 billion ? 
  transferring it from the ecb to the esm ? 
  i am more worried about that 2.5 billion ( ? ), 
  in a few days . 
  it wont go through the european parliaments fast enough to grant money fast enough . 
  i would argue that the problem lays more with your inefficient authorities and judiciary . 
  of course grexit plays a role , however unsustainable debt that comes into effect in maybe 20-30 years doesnt hinder investions . 
  i read that comment . 
  i can see them get a sizable demonstration . 
  however , the communists are a small minority in the greek parliament , if they oppose it , not much would change . 
  they also rallied against previous agreements without great effect . 
  not really . 
  short-term a debt restructuring will only have a very minor impact as most of the debt isnt due in the next years and also the interest rates are extremely low . 
  long-term its a different story . 
  since this was preceded by an all-party meeting ( well , all that wanted ) in greece , i am certain they will have a majority , no matter what the left wing of syriza does . 
  what this would mean for the further governing work remains unclear however . 
  yes . 
  everything depends on sat and sun anyways , thats where the decisions ( at least in the eu ) will be made . 
  ` selling ' it to the national parlaments will be another task . 
  i think it is more due to the nature of such a ` debt relief ' . 
  i really doubt that there will be something called ` debt cut ' . 
  it will be prolongued maturity , even further decreased interest and stuff of that kind . 
  its the task for the creditors to find something of this kind , tsipras is n't really able to make concrete requests here . 
  [ the greek version ] ( http://www.naftemporiki.gr/documents/976682/gia-ti-diapragmateusi-kai-sunapsi-daneiakis-sumbasis-me-ton-europaiko-mixanismo-statherotitas-esm ) published the document about 25 mins earlier if i understand that correctly . 
  you really think so ? 
  there is no party that could gain enough from such a failure to realistically contest her . 
  there is also no personnel that could replace her in her own party currently . 
  same here . 
  but [ it seems ] ( https://twitter.com/duncanweldon/status/619266086157066240 ) it is pretty much the 26th june plan . 
  the greek reform proposal : [ http://www.naftemporiki.gr/finance/story/976680/the-greek-reform-proposals] ( http://www.naftemporiki.gr/finance/story/976680/the-greek-reform-proposals ), 
  what sense makes the `` the longer we wait '' in that statement ? 
  aid wont prevent the doubling . 
  uhm so what ? 
  how is the aid from europe connected to that ? 
  i dont think we are neutral . 
  unfortunately this crisis is highly polarizing . 
  if that was sarcasm , sorry , its late . 
  yes , thank you for telling me . 
   the more we wait the more they are as they have big fertility rates this does not sound any moderate . 
  elaborate please since there is obviously a lot of ` misunderstanding ' ? 
  edit : yeap , / r/european poster . 
  probably not as much ` misunderstanding ' . 
  i dont even want to engage in a heated discussion about this . 
  i am just annoyed by these low quality posts posting the same stuff over and over . 
  we can surely have a good discussion about all of these statistics combined as they draw a clearer picture . 
  however bringing up single statistics without putting them into context wo n't create any meaningful and reasonable discussion . 
  stuff like this is just polarizing . 
  only an extreme minority of germans here on reddit would call you greeks ` lazy ' . 
  this is much worse in the public discourse in germany or in the yellowpress here . 
  this is what i wrote ? 
  i said that gdp per hour worked doesnt say much either ( if left alone ) . 
  well , he is supposed to be a professor . 
  this however does not live up to the standard that i expect from a person with the highest education title possible . 
  challenge for you : find a single reddit post of mine where i call greeks lazy cunts . 
  have you even read what i just wrote ? 
  i do not contest this statistic , nevertheless it has been posted so often that it is not even funny anymore . 
  also , ` evidence ' - working hours alone dont tell the whole story . 
  [ gdp per hour worked ] ( https://i.imgur.com/paxctu3.jpg ) doesnt either . 
  i could also bring up multiple statistics how the average work life of a greek is shorter than in most parts of europe and all kinds of statistics of this kind . 
  nevertheless i do n't do it because it does not serve any reasonable purpose . 
  all of these statistics have been discussed here . 
  discussed a * lot * . 
  i sincerely doubt that posting the same stuff would prompt better/new results . 
  he has a german wife . 
  this bashing has nothing to do with being a brit . 
  oh come on . 
  again this ? 
  this statistic ( or at least a similar one ) is brought up like once every week . 
  this has already been discussed to death . 
  imagine these banks falling a few years ago . 
  i dont deny that part of it was also meant for the german and french banks , though . 
  [ more like the greek agricultural bank , piraeus , ngb and the alpha eurobank ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jun/17/greece-debt-crisis-bank-exposed ) , each holding more greek debt than germanys banks combined .
