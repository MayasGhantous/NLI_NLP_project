  true . 
  however , i imagine that the ecb would have a way to circumvent that . 
  they have proven to be really inventive . 
  bringing you to 60 % would basically fuck over spain . 
  depends on the kind of default . 
  since most of the greek bonds are issued under english law and the sums are in euro , ` defaulting ' would not make them debt-free . 
  but theoretically , yes . 
  broomstick diplomacy on the rise !, 
  in this case , the french people will pay . 
  french banks hold over 400 billions of italys debt . 
  gunboat diplomacy is actually not as bad as ... you know , the stuff we did . 
  sounds about right . 
  if we already go into ` fun ' stuff , go with german-engineered ` fun ' - [ fix & foxi ] ( http://www.kaukapedia.com/images/ff-fecchi.jpg ) , soon to be renamed debti and austeriti . 
  ( my god , german humor is horrible ), 
  you just need to find hussar wings somewhere ... 
  i think we already [ found a symbol ] ( http://econintersect.com/b2evolution/media/blogs/market/screenshot%20-%20%208_57_31%20am%206_12_2012%20001.png ) ... or , well , the italians did . 
  let poland be the occupier for once !, 
  sorry to spoil the fun , but hugo boss never designed the nazi uniforms . 
  they just produced them . 
  the percentage of gdp actually means nothing without consideration of other factors . 
  japan is able to sustain their budget despite having 270 % debt . 
  italy was pretty much at 120 % 20 years ago , belgium was even higher back then . 
  italys borrowing cost are still extremely low , unless this changes and unless they start borrowing heavily now , there have to be no overly serious worries . 
  [ this actually happened about 150 years ago ( german article , with google translate ) ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.welt.de%2fkultur%2fhistory%2farticle13716894%2fals-die-griechen-ihre-deutschen-reformer-verjagten.html&amp;edit-text= ) the current seat of the parliament in athens is actually of this origin . 
  actually the sustainability is not all that bad currently . 
  yes , there is a lot of room for improvement , but as long as they are able to honor their loan payments everything is fine . 
  i dont contest that in any way . 
  but i guess if anything like this is ever going to happen , it will be china buying us alltogether . 
  i am actually uncertain about that . 
  china isnt under pressure to get their money back quickly , contrary to us . 
  they might in fact be more friendly than we are . 
  it is the same in germany . 
  in fact some retirement funds are forced to spend a certain percentage in state bonds . 
  a cut to 60 % is simply not possible . 
  china has the money for it . 
  with their cash reserves of foreign currencies alone they could pay for 25 % of the total debt of all eu countries . 
  i doubt you could legally include the ecb in a haircut . 
  such a debt cut would be voluntarily , the ecb would likely be excluded . 
  the ecb is already driving borderline-legal programs , this would certainly be illegal by the european treaties . 
  it all depends on how it is handled . 
  how is that artificial ? 
  it matches the reality of the euro zone . 
  plus the money our banks hold . 
  well , if they are included in a debt cut . 
  i doubt that you can cut the debt of the remaining countries to 60 % without affecting lenders other than the government . 
  according to [ reuters ] ( http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/11/07/ez_bnkexp0711_sb.html ) , the exposition towards the piigs without greece was roughly 475 billion . 
  lets say a cut would be equally distributed ( im gon na use wikipedia here , 2014 data for debt level , the exposition data is from 2011 ) country | debt % gdp | difference to 60 % | required cut | german exposure | german cut -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- portugal | 127 | 67 | 52 % | 35 bn . | 18.2 bn . 
  italy | 135 | 75 | 55 % | 160 bn . 
  ireland | 125 | 65 | 52 % | 110 bn . 
  spain | 99 | 39 | 38.4 % | 175 bn . 
  | 67.2 bn in total roughly 230 billion , or 6 % of our gdp . 
  this is raw exposure , it does not include the fact that the banks of the named countries would collapse under a debt cut , requiring more money . 
  it also leaves out any efsf payments . 
  what is more worrying is france . 
  france held over 620 billion in 2011 , which is significantly more than germany , combined with less economic prosperity and a lower gdp , this doesnt look that well . 
  please correct me if i got something wrong . 
  i think it is wrong to take this out of a plain line . 
  with this logic you could also argue that germany was doing better prior to the euro ( in 2000 ) , which was not exactly the case . 
  at that time , germany was still called ` sick man of europe ' and the agenda 2010 wasnt in place yet . 
  the growth of germany during the crisis was not immense , the increase in the overall share is mainly due to other economies decreasing . 
  due to our export-heavy industry we actually benefit more when the others are stepping up their game because they can buy more of our stuff . 
   if greece exits the euro i expect the euro to climb in value which will hurt german exports , so merkel has absolutely no reason to remove grexit fears or want them back to the drachma , the win-win for merkel would be for greece to accept another extend and pretend agreement so grexit could continue to supress the euro value and help german exports . 
  merkels hidden plan revealed . 
  but honestly , do you really believe that ? 
  the germans would be fine with the euro being valued higher by quite a margin . 
  hence the opposition to qe from pretty much all german officials , in the central bank , in politics and in the economy . 
  source ? 
  i have a hard time believing these numbers are correct . 
  well , concerning syria it is somewhat due to the obstacles on the way towards europe . 
  trust me , there are a lot of old people , women and children in the camps on the syrian borders . 
  however , look what the people that actually arrive here had to go through . 
  i doubt that a dangerous boat fare is the ` right ' thing for the elderly . 
  considerung women : from what i have read , the men go to europe hoping that they will be able to bring their family here later in a safer way . 
  our export industry proclaimed 1.30 $ / 1 $ as optimum for us a few years back . 
  it means that we are already at a weakpoint . 
  bild is not exactly a stronghold of quality journalism and all i can say is that i am sorry this newspaper exists . 
   german media is extremely anti-greek , spreading lies that nobody in greece pays taxes , all corrupt , etc . 
  it is fucking disgusting and will not be forgotten . 
  obviously the tone is not that positive about greece , however i disagree with calling all media anti-greek . 
   greece has followed every single request for budget management the last 2 years they didnt . 
  they merely applied what was negotiated , in some parts without great success . 
  the requests were even harder than the negotiated stuff . 
   considering we are in a `` union '' ( lol ) , you would think that there would be some kind of common decency to accept that greeks have shown honest effort in balancing the budget and now all greece needs would be to unload some of the major debt hurdles , mainly july/august 2015 and allow for a smooth transition into long-term sustainability , removing the `` grexit '' curse from greece which would open lots of investment . 
  so you mean they should go like ` yeah they showed a lot of effort , lets just ignore what is still wrong from now on '' ? 
  as i said , you cant sell debt relief to the european electorate currently . 
  this is less about anti-union stuff but about people not wanting to give away money . 
  also , do you really think that the grexit threat is the only thing preventing investions ? 
  greece is , sorry , a shithole for investments . 
  the country is not competitive , the jurisdiction and the authorities are slow , inefficient and party corrupt , everything takes a long time , and additionally you have a far-left government now which isnt exactly looking promising for investors . 
   instead we got attemped regime change negative comments about your government is not a ` regime change ' . 
  taking a position in your elections isnt either . 
  german politicians support french politicians ( and vice versa ) of the same political nuance , unless they misuse their official position to do so , it is totally fine . 
   anti-greek media across every eu country and the greek media totally isnt anti-german . 
  you should really start to care less about foreign media . 
   even though tsipras handed in a 47 page reform package which introduced massive reforms , including building a 15,000 person tax agency and massive curbs to tax evasion and other major reforms . 
  handing in a reform proposal doesnt make this proposal sustainable . 
  guess what , the institutions also had a proposal . 
  having one doesnt say anything about how good it is . 
   after all this , the budget surplus , reform package and considering greece is in the `` union '' , you would think there would be a single fucking person in the eu to show some kind of compassion to the 60 % youth unemployed and just give them a small glimmer of hope . 
  but how ?
