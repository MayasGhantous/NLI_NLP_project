  something if this kind , yes . 
  this would have to be done unter the supervision of the ecb though . 
  we could them send the leftover bills from 1922/23 . 
  theres nothing like paying for a piece of bread with a [ five trilllion mark note ] ( http://www.banknoten.de/images/product_images/popup_images/ger_rb012_16_f.jpg ) . 
  disclaimer : we use different words for large numbers in german . 
  billion ( ger ) = trillion ( eng ) = 1.000.000.000.000, 
  depends on how the debt is distributed . 
  if a large share of it is held by e.g. 
  the * commerzbank * it might cause some trouble . 
  direct debt towards our govt should be 54 billion , not including target . 
  people you can [ vote aswell ] ( http://www.bild.de/politik/inland/griechenland-krise/das-bild-referendum-41599084.bild.html ) . 
  it is right below that large black box . 
  given the educational demographic of * bild * readers and the general kind of articles this `` newspaper '' writes about greece , the outcome wont be any surprise . 
  banks still hold greek debt . 
  the expositure of german banks should be around 8 billion euros . 
  ideas that have no potential of passing the parliaments all over europe do not have immense value . 
  they can be as brilliant as you want ( debateable considering varoufakis ) , unless they can realistically be implemented , they arent worth anything . 
  then we would have no euro . 
  further integration , especially considering economic matters wasnt feasible 15 years ago and it isnt now either . 
  calling [ ralf stegner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ralf_stegner ) a conservative mp is just a blatalant lie . 
  first of all , he is n't exactly an mp of the federal republic of germany but the head of the ruling parliament group in one of our federal states . 
  ( do you still call this an mp ? 
  i dont know ) secondly , he is not member of the conservative cdu but of the socialdemocratic spd . 
  even in this party , he is a representant of the more leftist people . 
  to round this up , the conference where varoufakis is speaking is lead by the [ hans-b\u00f6ckler-stiftung ( in german ) ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans-b%c3%b6ckler-stiftung ) which is a foundation of the worker union confederation of germany . 
  something like this has been reported months ago . 
  printing drachmas would not mean that it is sure greece is leaving the euro zone tough . 
  it would simply be paying tribute to the possibility of a grexit . 
  during the cold war , germany printed a different series of marks for the case of a war . 
  they were never meant to serve as legal tender , they just wanted to be prepared . 
  uh what ? 
  they own presses for euro bills . 
  i do not know how easy it is to change them to print different bills . 
  this is not a matter of capacity . 
  we live in the era of international trade of goods . 
  there are so many printing agencies for official matters like bills or ids in europe , i have a hard time beliving that this is true . 
  pretty much what i exepected , however i thought norway was hit harder . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'd expect switzerland and the uk to be on the top by a large margin in 1945 . 
  that is pretty impressive . 
  unforunately the war hit shortly after . 
  i 'd like to see this series continued with 1945 and 1950 or something . 
  between 1880 and 1925 , your country is pretty much average if compared with the ` rich ' european countries . 
  can you tell me why there was such a steep increase in the 13 years between '25 and ' 38 ? 
  well , you were somewhat ` average ' , you certainly improved more than the rest of europe . 
  / r/travel i guess . 
  probably by plane or by bus . 
  note that the 1938 number ( germany ) is simply inflated by enormeous arms expenditures . 
  germanys finances were on the verge of a collapse at that point . 
  i actually had a hundred ideas how to modify the images of this `` camps were german '' campaign to fit this , but i guess i 'll pass , somewhat worried that it would violate the sub rules concerning holocaust . 
  you can even get a license for public streets for a [ kettenkrad ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/nsu_kettenkrad_36ps_1944_1.jpg ) here . 
  however , that is not comparable to a tank . 
  nevertheless , a demilitarized tank is not more dangerous than e.g. 
  a large agricultural vehicle . 
  as for the mental state , i agree with you . 
  the uk is even selling stuff directly from their military . 
  you are not required to carry it around except for some special cases ( like when you are allowed to carry a weapon in public ) . 
  wrong . 
  you are obliged to own either a national id or a passport from the age of 16 , however you are not required to carry it with you all the time . 
  probably to examine the tank in a bigger hall to determine whether it is potentially dangerous and thus illegal . 
  i know about at least [ one place ] ( http://www.panzerfahrschule.de/ ) in germany where you can drive a tank ` for fun ' . 
  however , they offer 13.5 ton light tanks and not a 45 ton monster . 
  ( they also offer a t-72 , which weighs less than a panther , and it also lacks the turret ) . 
  i guess it is possible to argue that a tank of this size is dangerous , no matter if armed or not . 
  depends . 
  according to his lawyer , the tank is demilitarized . 
  to my knowledge , it is not forbidden to own such a thing , you are just not allowed to drive on the public streets with it . 
  also , i doubt that it will be confiscated , so it is pretty unlikely that a museum will get it . 
  its more likely that a museum will get this once this guy dies ( he is over 70 years old ) . 
  * this was posted earlier * the sources are from 2012 * everything is relative, 
   `` he was chugging around in that thing during the snow catastrophe in 1978 , `` driving around in style . 
  this pretty much goes against any statistic on people being able to hold a conversation in english . 
  it can also be done with investments from abroad . 
  however , this is extremely unlikely due to greece being a shithole for investors . 
  greeces exports would not really benefit from a weakened drachma as there are n't any . 
  greece exports products that actually do not need to be * that * competitive so far . 
  asides from that , greece exports gasoline , but it relies on imports of crude oil . 
  this would eat up most of the benefits already . 
  competitivity is increaseable within a joint currency . 
  there are enough examples of incompetent populists getting elected in history . 
  people that actually had no clue and did not give a fuck . 
  inb4 reports about ` hidden us-operated baseball camps ' in poland . 
  germany complaining because the us uses air fields in germany to fly people to baseball matches . 
  the fact that not everyone can be a net exporter should not hinder some countries becoming one . 
  if greece would run a ` significant ' trade surplus , they would export goods worth around 60 billion dollars a year . 
  this is * nothing * , the world market is able to absorb this without any effort , however this would require greece to produce more products that are actually wanted abroad . 
  set up a secret baseball-watch-camp in cuba i guess . 
  this is a different scenario however . 
  i doubt the icj would have a problem with countries seizing based on outstanding payments like in greece or in argentinia . 
  it is something different to ` award ' someone compensation from another country . 
  in this case , it does not matter whether the claimant is a state or a private citizen ( unless we are talking about supranational courts like the ecj or the icj here ) . 
  i doubt that there is a difference between a country trying it and citizens doing it . 
  if a state tries to seize something , it will still go up to a court . 
  it still violates the sovereignity of another country . 
  i never claimed it did . 
  i was just responding to you saying  i hope to never see the day where germany , or any other european country , will find it worthwhile to seize another european country 's assets . 
  the cases proves that there have been attempts to do so , no matter the reason why it was tried or where the demands originated . 
  the judgement certainly carries some weight concerning the current situation with greece . 
  however i do not know how the legal possiblities of seizing a defaulting country 's assets are .
