  in case that authorities are understaffed , improving them is even more needed . 
  well , arguing that tsipras should be removed does not indicate that he is oblivious to whatever the eu wants from him . 
  quite the contrary , it would be surprising if he was supporting tsipras given that they didnt form a coalition with syriza . 
  the greek government has already layed off enough people under the requests of the troika . 
  there is certainly a need for people in other authorities , especially in the tax inspection . 
  while these people are not educated to fill this role , any support will help the tax inspectors . 
  then again , streamlining does not mean that you have to fire a lot of people , it means that the same number of people can process more in the same time . 
  arguably digitizing procedures requires funds true , however it is possible to streamline the internal processes , reassigning tasks etc. 
  without the need of major funding . 
  since the information about the author is written in german , here is a translation : pavlos eleftheriadis is a professor for european law and legal philosophy teaching at the university of oxford and spokesman of european affairs for the greek opposition party `` to potami '' . 
  well , its easier to channel anger at one person compared to an anonymous agency . 
  reforming authorities to be more slim and efficient is not exactly connected to much money , it is just a herculean task as it will face a lot of resistance . 
  even more so for the judiciary . 
  because this is the primary argument why the work of the nsa is deemed ` benefitial ' for eu countries . 
  how is that related to what i just wrote ? 
  i did not want to say that greece becomes germany because it holds its wages down . 
  i just wanted to say that it is not unprecedented that real income levels stay flat for a long period of time . 
  of course greeces economy needs loans and especially investments , however greece has proven time and time again that it is a really bad place to invest in . 
  due to strikes ( which brought down the tire production in greece ) , due to the authorithies being slow and inefficient ( which brought down the former greek auto industry ) , due to the judiciary being slow and ineffective in pursuing claims . 
  unless they reform that , there will be no investments . 
  well , i meant percentage points . 
  depends . 
  118 % is lower than italy and given that greeces debts already have interest well below where it should be , it doesnt sound that unsustainable to me . 
  of course it is not where you want it to be , but 50 % within 15 years would be incredible process . 
  well , germany experienced a decade without real wage or pension growth . 
  of course , 15 years is a long time and i know that other predictions by the imf were severely fucked up , but if it is true , it is n't * as * bad . 
  no matter what , it will be an enormeous task . 
  124 % by 2022 is ridiculous . 
  i was talking about the 2030 decrease which seems a lot more realistic . 
  15 billion in privatizations within 15 years is not that unlikely . 
  reducing your debt/gdp ratio by 50 % ( points ) within 15 years does n't sound that bad to me . 
  i doubt that auto translation does stuff like writing half words in bold . 
  i would advise you to post your question [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3bnly5/the_euro_was_a_big_mistake_and_greece_is_paying/ ) , where this article was posted earlier , this one is likely to be taken down due to being a repost . 
  i know that we already had multiple people linking tsipras ' letter , but this blog post by the brussels bureau chief of the ft outlines what the suggested stuff actually means in complete terms . 
  it also uses some weird syntax . 
   greece 's is ... what the hell ? 
  this is supposed to be an official document ? 
  [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras#block-5592aad4e4b055829a0c6eac ) links exactly this letter . 
   ** by th ** e europe ** an ** who the hell would bold half a word ? 
  also , ** greece 's ** . 
  depends on assigning russia to europe . 
  was that font and highlighting done by the greek government ? 
  please not . 
  any time someone tried to impose something unpopular , he would immediately be voted out of office , no matter that it would be the best for the countrys wellbeing . 
  unfortunately greece does not have the money to make the initial payment to access this money . 
  this is not an ` internal european ' conflict . 
  in general concerning europe-internal matters and in special about greece . 
  you can be worried about whatever you want . 
  ufos for example . 
  however linking a completely onesided piece of opinion as ` information ' does not benefit a rational discourse in the slightest . 
  well for europe about 75 years . 
  do n't be silly , this time is over and while greece might ruin their financial credibility for years to come , they wo n't be so ridiculously stupid and ruin any potential relationship with a move like this . 
  its probably us-financed equipment , heh :p, 
  i do not think a government would hide the money it invests into its intelligence agency . 
  the us never did , it did no harm to the nsa . 
  china is more interested in a greece that remains in the eu . 
  russia already had to undergo spending cuts to finance crimea , they can not ` afford greece ' . 
  why do you assume the worst ? 
  greece could also start their jets and bomb berlin . 
  am i afraid of it ? 
  because they are no * fucking morons * . 
  why would anyone in the 21st century even * consider * war a viable option ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  yes , the language is drastic , however it perfecty fits the situation . 
  what you identify as a ` threat ' is merely the eu leaders outlining the consequences of a ` no ' - vote in their view . 
  the opinion that a ` no ' - vote would be suicidal to greece is not exclusive to politicians , it is supported by economists ( and naturally opposed by others ) . 
  nobody forces you to vote for anything , nevertheless it is their right trying to influence you over the media . 
  i am a bit uncertain on that court action . 
  what are they trying to accomplish with it ? 
  an injunction that prevents the other countries from kicking greece out of the euro zone ? 
  they can have that everyday , however if greece leaves the ez it will be on its own accord anyways . 
  the court can not prevent the other ez members from ` forcing ' out greece by not providing further assistance . 
  they can not really expect any succes from a process against the ecb measures however . 
  grabbing data and storing it is actually not that expensive or complicated ( given that they have access to the net which they do ) . 
  analyzing is where the big money is needed , otherwise you just have a giant amount of data you wont be able to use ever . 
  the bnd has a budget of 350 mio . 
  i did not think that it was possible to do anything ` advanced ' given that little budget . 
  lobbying for a position is nothing bad . 
  tsipras also goes ahead and publishes texts about what he thinks should happen/needs to be happening in european newspapers . 
  nobody ever complained about it . 
  why do people always come up with ridiculous stuff like this . 
  we already had a thread yesterday discussing what would happen in that case . 
  printing euro bills wont be enough to keep greece ` afloat ' , imf payments can not be made in cash . 
   there is a scenario , although complicated . 
  you could reestablish border controls to greece , disallowing them to bring further y-money into europe . 
  for a few weeks , you would be able to exchange y-notes for other bills in your local bank . 
  accompany this with a wide media campaign and the collateral will be reduced to a minimum . 
  after that exchange period , the y-notes would not serve as legal tender anymore . 
  the way i outlined would not harm the amount of money in the ez in any way as there could be new notes issued for exactly the amount of bills that were exchanged . .  greece would be immediately cut off swift . 
  the elas of the ecb would end immediately . 
  syriza is right when they claim that there is no legal way to kick them out of the ez or the eu , however going to court for it seems a bit desperate . 
  so far , nobody hasnt kicked anyone . 
  it starts to get embarassing for us . 
  on a sidenote , i am actually impressed , i always thought about the bnd as an underfounded dumbfuck organization . 
  obviously they actually * can * do something . 
  it depends on how the risk is spread . 
  if it is concentrated on a very few banks , it is an issue , if it is widely spread , it is n't . 
  10 billion is still a significant sum for a bank . 
  i actually dont even remotely enjoy the thought . 
  i really just think it is bullshit .
