i have read this a few times now and really wonder in which regions sauce is called tunke . 
  eurobonds should be introduced but they should be only used for investments at eu level and not for the country level . 
  this would give the eu budget more flexibility and since it is decided upon by the commission , parliament and council there is no problem with democratic control . 
  when the member countries decide to transfer further powers to the eu , like for example a common military , or common unemployment benefits or pensions , it becomes significant , if the member countries decide that they want to keep all that on a national level , the financial responsibility should also be kept on a national level . 
  i would go the brazilian root and build a new capital at the tripoint were the austrian , slovenian and italian borders meet . 
  parts of the capital would be situated in a germanic , romance and slavic language speaking country . 
   in the german one , the first 20 articles are unchangeable ( eternity clause ) . 
  only article one ** and ** twenty not one to twenty . 
   economics : i am a liberal . 
  i think that private companies are usually more efficient and have better financial results . 
  i also think that some things should be controlled by the state ( police , military ) . 
  for health and education , the state should guarantee free access . 
  this is a centrist sentiment and is shared by the cdu , fdp , the right wing of spd and greens to varying degrees . 
   immigration : ( 1 ) ** i am anti muslim immigration ** , because in my experience , those people do n't integrate well on western societies and refuse to change their values , probably because they stay ultra religious . 
  i have no problem with immigration from other countries , inside or ( 2 ) outside eu . 
  black , white , all the same . 
  besides the far right no party would put it like ( 1 ) . 
  concerning ( 2 ) the centrist position in germany is for freedom of movement inside the eu , but outside immigration only for skilled workers , after the employer proves that inside the eu nobody is able to fill the position . 
  the cdu is pretty much against all unskilled immigration from outside of the eu and wants certain limits on inside eu migrant , when they only come to germany to claim benefits , so does the part of the spd . 
   social rights : pro gay marriage , pro abortion , pro legal weed , anti euthanasia . 
  these sentiments are all present in all parties left from the cdu ( fdp , spd , greens , left ) gay marriage also gains traction inside the cdu , less so legal weed . 
   eu : i was a federalist , but now i am very eurosceptic . 
  even so , i would like to see a open europe , with closed external borders . 
  its a bit unclear what that means . 
  but closed external borders and freedom of movement for europeans is the centrist position in germany . 
  but they are also in favor of further integration . 
  all your positions are pretty centrist , the anti islam thing would n't be put like that , but if you ask for limitations of immigration from outside the eu that is a pretty standard position . 
  the question is how much weight you put on you positions . 
  i have heard trump is easy to influence and manipulated , so i would love him to visit and meet our government . 
  okay , here is a map showing dialect regions for german , dutch and frisian : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/continental_west_germanic_languages.png these maps show germany 's dominant religions : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_germany#/media/file:evangelisch_zensus_2011.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_germany#/media/file:katholisch_zensus_2011.png if you take the dialect regions and check if they have a divide with regard to the dominant christian confession , you will have a good approximation for german cultural regions . 
  additionally , here is map from a german study , that looked at how germany could be divided into federal states , where each state is centered around an agglomeration : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/neugliederung_des_bundesgebietes#/media/file:rutz-17-l%c3%a4nderl%c3%b6sung.png it turned out , that the resulting states would be relatively homogeneous with regard to their respective regional culture . 
  which makes sense if you think about it . 
  edit : and since i am from berlin i would say brandenburg with berlin as capital would be a viable but shitty country . 
  http://www.n-tv.de/politik/merkel-ich-verdiene-genug-article9873636.html so she made around 25,000 euro per month since 2005 , before that she made less than 10,000 $ per month as a member of parliament ( https://www.bundestag.de/abgeordnete18/mdb_diaeten/1333/260804 ) between '98 and ' 05 . 
  between '91 and '98 she got around 15,000 $ as a federal minister ( http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/die-gehaelter-der-regierungsmitglieder-id3725766.html ) . 
  before that she was paid in monopoly money in east germany as a research scientist . 
  her husband is a professor and research scientist in berlin . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joachim_sauer they have a frugal lifestyle , so they have probably saved quite some money by now . 
  merkel lives in a flat in this house in berlin : https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4348013/merkel_20home.0.jpg edit : she also owns this house templin : http://bilder2.n-tv.de/img/incoming/origs1803841/6182735290-w1000-h960/2u322819.jpg, 
   superior most notably in elevation . 
   what steps would be taken to prevent demographic suicide ? 
  weird metaphor for a demographic development . 
   anyways , with the increase of migrant populations and their higher birthrates , are you alarmed at a cultural/ethnic shift in the next century ? 
  i would write a more substantial answer , but for that we would need to discuss actual numbers , so if you want that , you could start by providing statistics to quantify the phenomena you want to discuss . 
  some countries allow you to live there if you invest money , create jobs or buy property , so being an american lawyer may not be enough , having enough money on the other hand ... http://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2013/09/29/want-to-live-in-europe-buy-a-residency-permit/#242674637c26, 
   they are n't refugees arriving in europe though . 
  i would say in common parlance these people will still be identified as refugees , and the dictionary agrees with me : ' a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster ' https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/refugee but the dictionary is not important , if we look at the relevant passages for exclusion from refugee status , you will see , that having crossed through a third country does n't apply : ` article 12 exclusion 1 . 
  a third-country national or a stateless person is excluded from being a refugee if : ( a ) he or she falls within the scope of article 1 ( d ) of the geneva convention , relating to protection or assistance from organs or agencies of the united nations other than the united nations high commissioner for refugees . 
  when such protection or assistance has ceased for any reason , without the position of such persons being definitely settled in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the general assembly of the united nations , those persons shall ipso facto be entitled to the benefits of this directive ; ( b ) he or she is recognised by the competent authorities of the country in which he or she has taken up residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country , or rights and obligations equivalent to those . 
  a third-country national or a stateless person is excluded from being a refugee where there are serious reasons for considering that : ( a ) he or she has committed a crime against peace , a war crime , or a crime against humanity , as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes ; ( b ) he or she has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his or her admission as a refugee , which means the time of issuing a residence permit based on the granting of refugee status ; particularly cruel actions , even if committed with an allegedly political objective , may be classified as serious non-political crimes ; ( c ) he or she has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the united nations as set out in the preamble and articles 1 and 2 of the charter of the united nations . 
  paragraph 2 applies to persons who incite or otherwise participate in the commission of the crimes or acts mentioned therein . 
  and ` article 17 exclusion 1 . 
  a third-country national or a stateless person is excluded from being eligible for subsidiary protection where there are serious reasons for considering that : ( a ) he or she has committed a crime against peace , a war crime , or a crime against humanity , as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes ; ( b ) he or she has committed a serious crime ; ( c ) he or she has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the united nations as set out in the preamble and articles 1 and 2 of the charter of the united nations ; ( d ) he or she constitutes a danger to the community or to the security of the member state in which he or she is present . 
  paragraph 1 applies to persons who incite or otherwise participate in the commission of the crimes or acts mentioned therein . 
  member states may exclude a third-country national or a stateless person from being eligible for subsidiary protection if he or she , prior to his or her admission to the member state concerned , has committed one or more crimes outside the scope of paragraph 1 which would be punishable by imprisonment , had they been committed in the member state concerned , and if he or she left his or her country of origin solely in order to avoid sanctions resulting from those crimes .

  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32011l0095 so neither in day to day speak nor under the legal definition are these ` illegal aliens ' . 
  i mean , it seems pretty clear , that you are just repeating talking point , you should seriously consider ditching those sources . 
   no , of course it would n't . 
  they would stay the same just as they always have . 
  what do you mean , as they always have ? 
  my grandfather was born under the reign of emperor wilhelm ii and the societal values radically shifted several times during his life . 
   plenty of those were developed when there was a fairly homogeneous culture and some even developed those in times when various groups were being exiled and expelled . 
  european countries where always very diverse and human rights where developed as a reaction to various attempts to force homogeneity . 
  check for example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussia#non-german_population and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussia#religion  now if you want to weaken those principles you only need to have more and more people in your nation who do not believe in those things and have no cultural affinity for them and even dislike and oppose those values you are so proud of preserving . 
  there is no cultural affinity to human rights in european cultures , they have become societal norms against traditional cultures , not as organic development out of european cultures . 
  that many people accepted them in europe is due to them being successful in creating societies worth living in . 
  for example my grandfather on my fathers side was a catholic who would only agree to allow my father to marry my protestant mother if it was clear , that all the children would be raised catholic . 
  my mother was told by her mother not to be friendly with catholic children in school and this was after the war in germany . 
  only growing living and growing up in west germany made them appreciate individual freedoms . 
  you are basically alleging , that people from muslim countries could never adapt to life in germany , because in their home country these values have n't become the norm in their generation , but humasn are obviously capable of that and i have met many examples of it in my life . 
  you know by actually meeting people from muslim counttries and if my anecdotes are not enough for you , you could for example consider a few statistics on this : https://www.bmi.bund.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/566008/publicationfile/31710/vollversion_studie_muslim_leben_deutschland_.pdf so on page 194 - 196 it quantifies how many muslim women wear any islamic headdress , keep in mind , we have obviously also non-religious and christian migtrants from majority muslim countries , these numbers are for self identified muslims in germany . 
  its overall number is below 30 % , so yes , over 70 % of muslim women in germany do not even wear a headscarf . 
  but figure 49 on page 196 is more interessting , it shows the breakup of age groups . 
  in the group of 16 - 25 years the numbers are down to 22 % . 
  this could indicate , that younger muslims adapt to western life and to me that is a pretty obvious interpretation . 
  muslim girls have access to the same internet and television , go through the same public schools and are subject to the samemagazine covers as german girls . 
  western society is very attractive and persuasive independent of your cultural background . 
   now you have a lot more potential voters to transform , vote against those things , care nothing about them . 
  refugees in germany are not allowed to vote and not handed citizenship just like that . 
  the majority of them will have to go back home if the security situation improves in their home countries . 
  the chances for rejected asylum seekers to ever be allowed to vote in germany are even slimmer . 
   having to flee from your country will completely disrupt your education , work , families and your life in general but is better than losing your life or health in a meaningless war . 
      almost none of the migrants are fleeing war and death threats after they crossed the borders into turkey or jordan and other safe zones . 
  i was referring to the reason they left their home country . 
  if someone leaves their home because of war , they are refugees and if they ask a country for protection a third country they might have crossed on their way has no obligations to them under international law . 
  that is the reason why we needed to first make the turkey deal , before we could deport syrians to turkey and that is the reason why there needed to be the dublin regulations before refugees could be deported to countries inside europe , and even if a international treaty between countries exist , a country is not allowed to send refugees back to a third country if said country can not or will not take care of the refugees according to international standards . 
   ( 2 ) this is completely absurd and sounds like the nonsense a conspiracy theorist would make up . 
  in germany for example the position of powers are held by devoted christians . 
      your second sentence has nothing to do with the first . 
  oh , i assumed you wanted to imply that people who have influence in any way would think like that . 
  okay , so we agree that there are no influential people who think like that . 
   you should know that a lot of socialist , globalist , communist types despise christianity ( for reasons mentioned ) . 
  well , i am very familiar with atheist organizations in germany and i would say that i never have met anybody who prefers islam over christianity . 
  i actually would be very interested if you could provide any sources where people think bringing a lot of muslims into germany or europe would be a good idea to weaken christianity ( and i do n't mean people alleging that their political enemies have these position ) since you mention socialist . 
  the left party ( die linke ) in german which is the most powerful socialist party in germany has made bodo ramelow the prime minnister of the land thuringia . 
  this is the highest political office they ever attained after reunification and he is also a devoted christian and the most prominent leader of the kommunistische plattform , the communist wing of said party is sarah wagenknecht . 
  http://www.sahra-wagenknecht.de/de/article/7.das-leben-leben.html to paraphrase her position , she thinks that christianity is an important part of german cultural heritage , that you need to understand it to understand marx and hegel and that it should be taught in school , but not to indoctrinate , but to educate . 
  when i said that people in power in germany are christians , i also meant the socialist , the greens etc , why would they vote outspoken christians in positions of power ? 
  again , if your point is , that some guy somewhere might think that refugees are a good thing to destroy christianity or whatever . 
  okay i guess someone might think that , but under those criteria someone might think that the political class is controlled by strange creatures inhabiting the inside of or hollow earth , or that you can treat aids with crystal power .
