  til that if you where to ask what the benefits for a society is to spend money on a geological research , people should not limit their answers to things like ` learning how to better find natural resources ' but listening in on the secret meetings of the mole people and learning about crystal healing is also on topic . 
   otherwise a lot of your post is just going in circles about human rights and why some european country has the right to extend its human rights to citizens of other countries and using ` human rights ' over and over again . 
  oh i am sorry english is not my first language , so i assume that i have not expressed my position adequately and i will try again . 
  my point is , that accepting refugees does n't benefit european countries in any material way , but rejecting them would damage the standing of very important core values or pillars of or societies . 
  those values are for example the rule of law and human rights . 
   otherwise a lot of your post is just going in circles about human rights and why some european country has the right to extend its human rights to citizens of other countries and using ` human rights ' over and over again . 
  those are n't the human rights of some european country , but they are the universal human rights , as they are agreed upon by the international community and laid out in various international treaties and documents . 
  the second point is simply a straw man , that is used in certain circles so they can feel persecuted . 
  well , if you want to mobilize people making them feel persecuted is an effective strategy , so you ca n't blame them that they use it . 
  refugees and asylum seekers are allowed to stay in europe for humanitarian reasons . 
  it would be better for everyone if they were n't forced to leave their home country . 
  having to flee from your country will completely disrupt your education , work , families and your life in general but is better than losing your life or health in a meaningless war . 
  ( 1 ) the european host countries that have a lot of refugees and asylum seekers could easily attract cheap labour via something like guest worker programs if they where in serious need for cheap labour , but europe has many regions with high unemployment . 
  so no , we do n't need refugees for the for cheap labour . 
  ( 2 ) this is completely absurd and sounds like the nonsense a conspiracy theorist would make up . 
  in germany for example the position of powers are held by devoted christians . 
  the benefits that i see for allowing refugees to stay in europe are different : it is advantageous to the well being of europeans if society puts human rights at the core of its laws and laws must be internally consistent or they suffer from a greatly reduced claim to validity . 
  since the physical well being and dignity are the very essence of human rights , a right to protection when the life and health of a human is threatened is necessary . 
  a society that puts human rights and rule of law as its core principles has to seriously take into consideration every claim to asylum every time and grant it if the claim is valid . 
  so granting asylum is not a thing that bears something positive for a country by introducing foreigners to its society , but by keeping human rights as the central pillar of our laws . 
  well , i am a european federalist , but i would n't want to model the european federation after the russian federation . 
  extremely unlikely . 
  i mean look at turkey for example : how likely is it , that turkey splits with only the european part joining am european super state ? 
  that is also not what happened . 
  monday the 4th of january was the date the national public broadcaster reported on it . 
  first local media reports were out almost immediately : http://www.rundschau-online.de/region/koeln/unruhige-silvesternacht-in-koeln-frauen-am-hauptbahnhof-belaestigt---beinahe-massenpanik-am-dom-23450094 http://www.express.de/koeln/silvesternacht-hauptbahnhof--junge-frauen-sexuell-belaestigt-23251504 media with a national audience reported the next day : http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/kriminalitaet-etliche-uebergriffe-auf-frauen-zu-silvester-in-koeln-1.2803626 so no , there was no cover up , it was immediately reported , but the national public broadcaster later admitted that they misjudged the scope of the events , so they reported one day later . 
  if you think there was a cover up during new years eve , you have fallen for right wing propaganda . 
  with regards to the concept of the optimum currency area i think it is a flawed theory and i think its underlying issue is the ideological limitation of wanting state interference in the economy reduced to monetary policy . 
  i do think , that in more uneven economies adjustments have to be made by the state to address the different needs of the different regions , but this is only a problem with a common currency if you exclude direct subsidies from your arsenal . 
  i think a positive result for the eurozone could be achieved for example by a social union additionally to a currency union , where benefits like pensions , unemployment benefits , health insurance , as well as minimum wages etc are transferred to the european level , rather than staying at the national level . 
  i am not inn favour of going back to national currencies and i think , that even if the eurozone would fail , there would be a currency union between several of the states in europe . 
  for example the benelux states , would n't make much sense to have three different currencies there . 
  so a dissolution of the eurozone would probably be more of a break up into a north and a south euro or several southern countries leaving the euro and i imagine that countries like czechia or hungary would be more eager to want to adopt a north euro . 
  the plan is to dissolve germany , have the l\u00e4nder join the eu and rename the eu in greater german empire . 
  brexit is part of the plan to have article 50 removed , so nobody can leave . 
  in my opinion what is needed is a kind of meta culture , that is quite minimal and focused on the rule of law , human rights , democracy and learning a common language with the host country or region . 
  new arrivals can keep their culture but have to change it in a way that adheres to the meta culture . 
  i think this approach is a form of multiculturalism , that is similar to the european approach to capitalism and free speech . 
  the precise limitation of free speech , the free market and multiculturalism should be found on a scientific and pragmatic base . 
  you can not incite violence in your speech , you can not let people get bankrupt because of healthcare , you can not allow a separate court system for one cultural group . 
  ideological purity should not be a hindrance for a well functioning society . 
  as an official language we should just develop a common european sign language out of [ isl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sign ) . 
  well , he saw your passport , so he knew you are an american , and people in europe generally think americans as americans first and foremost . 
  categories like irish-american , mexican-american erc do n't carry much weight . 
  if you have a typical mexican name like maria lopez , or lucia sanchez or something he might think of you as a mexican-amereican but i do n't think that there are any negative stereotypes about mexicans in europe . 
  i do n't know the numbers for france , but a few years back 32 % of americans answered in a poll , that the bible should be more important , than the will of the people when determining the law . 
   although the public clearly sees a strong link between christianity and the country 's national identity , most americans think citizen preferences should outweigh the bible as an influence on american law . 
  when asked which should have more influence over the laws of the country - the bible or the will of the people , even when it conflicts with the bible - most americans ( 63 % ) say the people 's will should have more sway . 
  a significant minority ( 32 % ) , however , believes the bible should be more important http://www.pewforum.org/2006/08/24/many-americans-uneasy-with-mix-of-religion-and-politics/#1, 
  in mv the last polls before the election had them at 23 % and 22 % and they got 20,8 % on election night . 
  ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/landtage/mecklenburg-vorpommern.htm ) i guess you could say it is in the margin of error . 
  the translation is a bit misleading . 
  it says : `` t\u00fcrkinnen tragen kopft\u00fccher '' = `` turkish women wear headscarfs '' `` kopftuch '' as a term is far broader than the term `` hijab '' . 
  `` is ' doch h\u00fcbsch '' does n't translate to : `` it 's beautiful ! '', 
  like in a `` being overweight/different is beautiful '' campaign . 
  `` h\u00fcbsch '' means `` pretty '' and in this sentence the `` doch '' is a bit hard to translate , but as a whole it would be : `` turkish women wear headscarfs . 
  me , too !, 
  pretty , is n't it ? '', 
  the ad uses the ambiguity of the term `` kopftuch '' . 
  the ad does not say or imply that the model is wearing an islamic headdress and it is clear , that what she is wearing is just an accessory . 
  the message is basically , that people should n't be so concerned with a piece of clothing . 
  he is not making fun of ireland but satirising populist politicians , so saying president instead of prime minister or taoiseach is part of the role . 
  keep in mind , that the role of the german president is very similar to that of the irish president , so this is not a mistake a german would make . 
  ( and taoiseach is n't hard to pronounce for a german at all ), 
   ehm , the spd was in a coalition with the greens at that time , also they had a majority in the first and second chamber for quiet some time . 
  the spd-green government was in power from the 27th october 1998 to 22th november 2005 , they lost the majority in the federal council ( bundesrat ) on the 7th april 1999 . 
  so , they had a majority in both the federal diet and the federal council for half a year out of 7 years . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/geschichte_des_bundesrates_ ( deutschland ) #die _ regierung_schr . c3.b6der _ .281998 . e2 .80.932005.29  if they wanted it to be 500 $ , they could have done it without the cdu intervening . 
  no , because the hartz iv reforms were past in 2003 in the federal diet and they needed the federal council 's approval , which means they needed the cdu 's approval . 
  ... and france and the uk .

   i think he means german states and citys . 
  berlin for example is known for burning money faster than you could print it without actually making any progress and having a huge debt . 
  it might be still known for that , but berlin has posted a budget surplus and reduced its debt for several years now . 
  ` politische stimmung ' is already normalized by demographics for their ` projektion ' they include information about what the person previously voted etc. 
  there is a lot of guesswork in the ` projektion ' , on the other hand , the ` politische stimmung ' is not a prediction . 
  quoting myself from / r/germany :  it actually seems that the spd lead is more substantial than it looks . 
    i think these are quite remarkable numbers and i think putting 12 points between the numbers for the spd is a bit excessive . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/5uz15e/germanys_spd_moves_ahead_of_merkels_party_in_poll/ddxyzh0/ ` politische stimmung ' are the raw numbers and ` projektion ' includes the analysis of the institute . 
  so , yeah , looking beyond the hype ... there is more hype . 
  looking at the numbers of the recent poll now over 82 % of germans support gay marriage ( its on page 3 ) : http://www.antidiskriminierungsstelle.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/publikationen/umfragen/handout_themenjahrumfrage_2017.pdf?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=3, 
  i know its not meant to be a serious remark , but american presidents were never protected by the law . 
  the law only applied to heads of states of countries with a similar law ( meaning countries were insulting a foreign leader is illegal ) . 
  merkel is not head of state in germany that 's joachim gauck and insult is still not allowed . 
  before the change of the law , insulting a head o state of another country was harder punished than normal insult , that 's what 's changing . 
  i have difficulties following your reasoning here , donald trump is defunding organization that provide health services and abortions in third world countries and this news says that the dutch government is talking to various other governments to raise the missing funds . 
  so it has nothing to do with anything inside of the usa . 
  ( i am not certain if i have understood your post correctly , english is not my first language , sorry . ), 
  well , we could also try to have a real analysis of the actual military need of a country or the alliance and not have spending goals attached to mostly unrelated economic data . 
  so we would need to come up with a defense scenario , after that we would determine which capabilities we need and than we look on the price tag for it . 
  with that i am not opposed to have different countries in the alliance agree to a spending goal and have them specialize in certain fields , keeping their gdp in mind etc. 
  but the way he 2 % gdp is discussed at the moment is really not very useful . 
  if we must have a general metric attached to military spending , we should take territory , populations size and gdp into account , but we would still need a factor that takes actual vulnerability into account . 
  for example having multiple islands and territories spread around the globe like france or the netherlands requires some investments that a country like poland would n't need . 
  maybe spending according to the extent of the territory that has to be defended would be a more reasonable approach . 
  additionally countries that have also a permanent seat in the united nations security council should be required to spent more than other countries . 
  yeah , i agree , something like that should n't even be part of the consideration for which candidate or party someone votes . 
  on the other hand , when will we have the chance again to top bismarck 's 19 years as chancellor . 
  merkel should try 20 years as chancellor , than one tour as first female president of germany and after that first protestant and female pope , this would clearly be the most interesting development and i will do everything * in my power to make that happen . 
  * that does not involve actually doing something , even completing this post seems like a stretch now that i thi,
