  imagine a terrorist escaping from wessex to east anglia with open borders . 
  remember the old saying : be divided and conquer !, 
  well , i would think there are two possible explanations here : ( 1 ) the police did n't really have good evidence on him . 
  they knew that he was up to something , but they also knew that it would n't hold up in court . 
  ( 2 ) they had good evidence , but they thought that they might get evidence on and insight into a terrorist network by observing him . 
  they had evidence that would hold up in court and did n't use it , because they misjudged the danger . 
  we could for example consider a scenario in which the police listens in on conversations of suspects , where his fellow terrorist say that amri is a coward , who just talks big but does n't have it in him to actually fight the fight . 
   does angela merkel ? 
  yes . 
  she has expressed in almost all her statements that while legitimate refugees will be supported people posing as refugees need to leave swiftly . 
  she said so from the very beginning and most of her actual policy measures where made to have fewer refugees in germany and deport rejected refugees faster . 
  international media basically ignores that . 
  if i remember correctly the number was corrected to around 890,000 and i think between 40 and 50 percent get their request rejected, 
   swiftly sent home economic migrants posing as refugees ( for example by declaring several countries as ` sichere herkunftsl\u00e4nder ' to use the technical term )  care to back this up with actual numbers or are you simply repeating what you read elsewhere ? 
  i do n't understand how any number can back up the claim that ` the ** official policy position ** of the german government with regard to the migrant crisis is to [ ... ] ( 2 ) swiftly sent home economic migrants posing as refugees ( for example by declaring several countries as ` sichere herkunftsl\u00e4nder ' to use the technical term ) ' and obviously i read it elsewhere and heard it by the way , how else would i have learned about what the official position of my government is . 
  i follow the news on a daily basis , but the government has a website and you can look at their archived statements : https://www.bundesregierung.de/siteglobals/forms/webs/breg/suche/en/suche_solr_servicesuche_formular.html here you can find an example of the stated government position on the topic at hand : https://www.bundesregierung.de/content/en/artikel/2015/10_en/2015-10-21-rueckfuehrung-im-kabinett_en.html?nn=709674 it is from october 2015 , so before the groping incidence of new years eve . 
   please share your stats on in-flow vs out-flow of german immigrants & migrants since 2012 ? 
  i do n't understand your request and i do n't see the connection to the topic . 
  why 2012 ? 
  merkel came into office in 2005 and her current government was elected in 2013 . 
  numbers of migrants to germany would also include intra-eu migrants . 
  but here you go : https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/societystate/population/migration/tables/migrationtotal.html a more sensible request would be for numbers of repatriations of rejected asylum seekers : ok , here is a government report on page six you can see the development of asylum ** aplications ** ( not arrivals ) over time : http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl-november-2016.pdf?__blob=publicationfile and maybe also interesting on page 3 you see the numbers for asylum requests since 1953 . 
  the spike in the numbers of applications lags several month behind in the spike of the numbers of arrival and first registration . 
  the reason should be obvious , but i am providing these numbers because repatriation obviously only applies to rejected asylum seekers . 
  here are numbers for repatriations under the reag/garp program : http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/bilder/en/statistiken/statistik-reaggarp-foerderung-ausreise.jpg?__blob=poster&amp;v=2 you can again see a lag in in repatriations . 
  the spike is in 1998 while the spike of request is in ' 93 . 
  the situation is different though but the numbers are useful for the general point for the current situation you can see the beginning of a sharp increase in repatriations . 
  these numbers are for a program where the government give cash incentives for voluntary returns , but those are not all the returnees numbers for people who return outside of these programs are difficult to get and can only be derived from other numbers in retrospect , so they are not available for the current crisis . 
  additionally here is an article about deportations : http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-11/asyl-abschiebungen-antraege-tuerkei i am sorry but i do n't have a pretty graph or an english source . 
  the article says that deportations have reached a 10 year high and are expected to be 26.500 for this year . 
  these numbers however do not fully reflect the changes that have been made to speed up the procedure , which became law only in spring . 
  to judge if they where successful we will have to wait how the numbers play out in the coming months . 
  a short overview over some measures can be found here : https://www.bundesregierung.de/content/en/artikel/2016/02_en/2016-02-04-asylpaket2_en.html?nn=709674  call merkel 's policy whatever you want to . 
  some call it ` open door ' or ` open arms ' and everyone except you seems to understand what it represents . 
  merkel 's policies are all about reducing refugee numbers in germany and europe and i already knew and criticized that ` some ' are calling it an ` open door ' policy because it is actually the reason people do * not * understand what the policies actually mean . 
   still , it does not change the fact that the immigration situation has been handled poorly by merkel . 
  this is not what is commonly known as a fact , it is an opinion . 
   by poorly i mean that there was no oversight and extreme muslim terrorists posing as immigrants have been able to communicate , plan and execute terrorist attacks in the last two years . 
  governments are not omniscient or omnipotent , so there will be always the possibility of crime and terrorism . 
  the 9/11 terrorists entered your country on tourist or student visas if i remember correctly any legal channel that makes it possible to enter a country can be used by criminals and terrorist and this does not delegitimize the intended and lawful use of it . 
  germany has to protect refugees under our constitution and international treaties , regardless of the fact , that terrorist might enter the country . 
  they could enter the country by other means anyway and terrorism iis actually not a relevant threat for the live and well being of germans . 
  its actual scope is so small , that it should not be a major point to consider when making policies . 
  well , it is regardless since people are irrationally afraid of it , but it is not an oversight to not make security and terrorism the centerpiece of your deliberations on refugees . 
  i think english language media just integrates international news in their political narrative . 
  so merkel becomes a naive left winger , strawmaned accordingly and discussed basically as a simplified fantasy version of herself . 
  i suspect that this is also facilitated by a lack of language abilities among the elites in the anglosphere . 
  a lot of journalists and commentators simply can not do any independent research into german policies and are completely reliant on the bottleneck of an already simplified , translated discourse of the german news media . 
  wait , you are claiming that ` open arms policy ' is a technical term in the sense that ` rhinoplasty ' is a technical term for a nose job . 
  that is obviously not the case and it would be strange to have a technical term for a set of policies meant for a such specific situation . 
  maybe you mean that the term ` open arms ' was used as a rhetorical device ? 
  again , the official policy position of the german government with regard to the migrant crisis is ( 1 ) to be welcoming to real refugees , ( 2 ) swiftly sent home economic migrants posing as refugees ( for example by declaring several countries as ` sichere herkunftsl\u00e4nder ' to use the technical term ) , to ( 3 ) not tolerate parallel societies and disregard for german culture and laws among migrants , ( 4 ) create a quota system to spread refugees around europe , which reduces economic incentives and ( 5 ) support neighboring regions to reduce the issues that lead to refugees coming to europe ( ` fluchtursachenbek\u00e4mpung ' ) , that was communicated by the government , simplified by the german press and totally misrepresented by international media and of course domestic right-wing extremists . 
  merkel did not implement anything like an open door policy . 
  after reports came out in germany , that the number of refugees was expected to rise to over 800,000 in one year , merkel tried to forge a european solution to reduce the refugees europe and to germany and only in that context her government decided to not deport syrians to other eu countries under dublin regulations for a while . 
  the courts had regularly stopped these deportations because greece etc where overwhelmed and could n't cope with the numbers , so trying to deport syrians to greece or hungary was pointless and clogging up the system . 
  the turkey deal greatly reduced refugee streams from syria and her proposed quota system with the whole european union would have greatly reduced the incentives for economic migrants to abuse their right to asylum . 
  internationally both the left wing media and the right wing media have totally misrepresented merkels positions and actions to further their respective agenda . 
  the ( english language ) left wing media pushed a narrative like : ` look how many refugees germany is taking in , an the us/uk/etc is taking only so few . 
  our terrible right wingers hate human rights ! ', 
  as a reaction the right wing started calling merkel crazy for positions she never held and policies she was never in favor of , because when their lefties call them racist they have to call them naive and they also started to make up all kind of bullshit about the situation in germany , because since they said that an open door policy would lead to chaos , there had to be chaos in germany . 
  well , there where some chaotic moments in germany for a while , but they where not predated , nor caused by any sort of open door policy on behalf of the german government . 
  i mean anybody who can look up the facts could see for themselves , but people rather want a spoon-fed narrative than complicated , boring , fact based information . 
  i live in berlin and i walked over that particular christmas market many times and i still feel that our christmas markets are save to visit . 
  in fact not only do i feel that way , i know it is the case in the same sense , that flying with an airplane is save despite airplanes being bombed in the past . 
  i think this means there will be some form of soft cap with no legal consequences , basically the coalition agreeing on trying to keep the numbers under 300k or something . 
  seehofers pandering is quite despicable , when you think about it . 
  pandering to the nonsensical demands of the far right to the detriment of the cdu and wider society , all to further the standing of his csu . 
  you can read a list the police has compiled here : www.mik.nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/redakteure/dokumente/themen_und_aufgaben/schutz_und_sicherheit/160111ssia/160111berppkoeln.pdf almost all of the cases are like this : a group of men surrounds the victim , the victim feels a hand on the butt and/or between the legs , later they realize that their mobile phone , their wallet etc are missing . 
  the vast majority of the cases are for ` sexuelle beleidigung ' ( insult with a sexual component beleidigung sex . 
  in this list ) , a few were for ` sexuelle n\u00f6tigung ' in which some sort of force or threat was used ( for example holding the victims arm ) and in the cases that were for rape , a finger was allegedly inserted in the vagina , while the groping was happening . 
  in almost all of the cases , the women were groped to stun them , to take their phone and wallet away , which is a well known pick pocket trick and not a cultural practice . 
  the chancellor is bound by the parliament . 
  in the parliament the chancellor is usually supported by a coalition . 
  the coalitions agenda is determined by an coalition agreement , the positions inside this agreement are determined by the parties platform , which is decided by the party convention . 
  so in case of merkel , she could be thrown out at any moment by the parliament , but she follows the compromise of her center right party with the center left spd and the right wing csu . 
  all those parties platforms are again a compromise between the various factions inside the party . 
  a politician who runs for chancellor however , will be influential within his or her party and will play the deciding role in forming the coalition compromise . 
  if the chancellor is more popular than the party , they can have quite a lot of wiggle room inside of all the agreements . 
  with regards to martin schulz , we could dicuss about his position inside of the spd , but for the actual policies it will be much more important to know his future partners in a coalition . 
  a spd/cdu coalition with schulz on top , will be very different from a spd/left/greens even with the same chancellor . 
  the first one would be essentially continuation of the policies we had in the last 12 years with slight changes . 
  with spd/left/green i would imagine lots of changes like gay marriage , drug legalization etc. 
  i do n't expect the social democrats to move on foreign relations or the economy . 
  extrajudicial killing is worse . 
  murder is usually a individual tragedy , an isolated and rare breakdown of societal norm . 
  extrajudicial killings are a systemic breakdown of societal norms . 
  the potential for escalation with murder is pretty low , we have serial killers , spree killers and terrorism . 
  those phenomena ca n't actually lead to widespread problems in a stable society , they can however lead to overreactions . 
  extrajudicial killings are individually as bad as murder , but the fact that they are carried out by state actors undermines the very principals of a free society . 
  the state is a terrible giant and with a single wrong move he can crush dozens , with only neglect thousands can die and with intent he can kill millions . 
  so the state must be chained and this is done by dividing its powers . 
  ignoring the proper procedure to use the states powers means essentially loosening the chains of the most terrible monster . 
  additionally , there were initial news reports about the rioting , the police thought they had it under control at some point and put out a statement stating that , but then the rioting continued and reports about ` sexuelle \u00dcbergriffe ' , mostly women being groped , were reported . 
  and if i remember correctly the wast majority of complains were filed with the police only after the press conference , something like 90 % if i remember correctly , after the police had specifically asked for victims to come forward . 
  so yeah , the local police essentially messed up , with both securing the scene and putting out information correctly . 
  the public broadcaster was a bit to careful , after all there is a lot of fake news out there , so the report was delayed for one day and that 's all that happened . 
  the plan is going well : britain will leave the eu , but not the single market , accept freedom of movement , join schengen and adopt the euro , and next both french and german as its co-official languages . 
  total eurocratic control , with no say in anything . 
  excellent work agent johnson , excellent work !, 
  it is a discussion about a law about german privacy rights , answering a person with a german flair , talking about crimes in a german city , which was an answer to the question ' i wonder what is coming into german society that would make them change their mind on this ? ',
