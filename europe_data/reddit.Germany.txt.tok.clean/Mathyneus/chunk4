  yes , they are . 
  anti-americanism is what the left revolves around entirely nowadays . 
  germany . 
  bavaria , to be exact . 
  most of the people with these views even attend the same university as me , which is very i know them from . 
  most people i know identify as left-wingers and they hold the view that europe should ally itself with russia and cut its ties with the us . 
  they have also told me that they genuinely believe that russia is a more progressive and democratic country than the us . 
  those exact same people claim that the us is `` violently homophobic '' ( direct quote ) because it has not allowed same-sex marriage until 2015 on a national level . 
  germany does n't currently allow it either , fyi . 
  i have not once heard them talking about russia 's policies on homosexuality . 
  so here 's my honest question : how , literally how , am i supposed to take the anti-american left seriously ? 
  i 'm trying to listen to both sides of an argument before making up my mind . 
  am i a wacko if i believe in a small government ? 
  how ? 
  as if europe is n't as corporatist as the us . 
  this cancer is already here , ttip or not . 
  but what if all established parties are so far from my views that any and all attempts to get them to shift them towards me is futile ? 
  hey , nobody hates my government 's economic policy more than me , but those are n't changing anyway . 
  when i vote , i have the choice between social democrats , social democrats , social democrats , socialists and `` conservatives '' acting like social democrats . 
  so why not focus on something else i care about , which is immigration ? 
  okay , so the first link does n't exactly explain in detail how africa is economically held back . 
  it 's just an plea . 
  i mean where is the prove that protectionist measures will result in more growth of gdp and income than free-ish trade ? 
  the scientific consensus is that free trade benefits everyone in the long run due to the combination of comparative advantages . 
  african countries may run a trade deficits at first , but those correct themselves , if the currency is allowed to fluctuate freely . 
  and even if it does n't , the us has been running a trade deficit forever and we 're still accusing them of * benefitting * more than us . 
  the second link is more interesting and certainly worrisome , but it 's still mostly unfounded accusations . 
  thanks . 
  i will check it out . 
   all you need to do is look to the autobahn and draw your own conclusions from there . 
  the autobahn was planned and approved during the time of the weimar republic . 
  hitler merely came into power before it could be built . 
  nice attempt at revisionism , though . 
   they brought back healthy birth rates and promoted family values by giving heavy support to families the fertility rate of the us in the 1940s was 2.5 children per woman , which is well above replacement level . 
  this was during a time of war and still ongoing effects of the great depression . 
  in the 1950s and 60s the rate was about 3.5 children per women , which leads to steady population growth . 
  so , according to you , the us was doing just as well , right ? 
  while at the same time not being a fascist dictatorship . 
   their rule created a united and close people with healthy values and society that could have prospered into utopia on earth . 
  values like what ? 
  brutal racism , antisemitism and genocidal war-mongering ? 
  i guess you mean values like the nuclear family , companionship , patriotism and traditionalism ? 
  well , the usa of the 1950s had that too , and they had just defeated nazi germany in a war , so they certainly did n't get them from them . 
   if the war had n't been forced into existence forced into existence by the nazis . 
  nazi germany invaded poland , knowing full well that this meant war with britain and france as well . 
  the soviets were essentially their partners until they attacked ( molotov-ribbentrop pact ) and the us originally wanted to abstain altogether . 
  the war is on the nazis , 100 % . 
   nazi germany could have been the most exemplary country we 've ever seen . 
  you 're entitled to this opinion . 
  you want to know why ? 
  because unlike the nazis , we have the freedom of opinion . 
  and the freedom of speech . 
  and freedom of religion . 
  and a bunch of other stuff , i personally think , are absolutely essential in order for a country to be considered `` exemplary '' . 
  it 's [ these ] ( https://fracfocus.org/chemical-use/what-chemicals-are-used ) , essentially . 
  hell , you can even [ drink ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krphnihlhgo ) the fluid . 
  so what else are german people supposed to do than vote for a right-wing `` populist '' party , if even the conservatives are n't decidedly against mass immigration ? 
  thanks , i 'll check it out . 
  these surveys are stupid . 
  of course i 'd be super comfortable with a muslim coworker , if it was my buddy ilkay . 
  neither me or him would be comfortable with a muslim coworker , if the guy was a fundamentalist . 
  it really bows down to whom people picture in their heads when asked this question : one of the many great people from any of these group ... or one of the many fuckwits from any of those groups . 
  what did they do that was great ? 
  so how exactly does a free trade agreement look like that * does n't * inhibit national sovereignity ? 
  i mean `` free-trade '' literally means that the german government can no longer ban/restrict me from buying an american potato , if an american is willing to sell it to me . 
  right now , it can . 
  hence , such an agreement would limit national sovereignity and strenghten my individual sovereignity , no ? 
  where exactly in ttip does it say that american lawyers now hold legislative powers in eu countries ? 
  all trade negotiations are secret , including the thousands that the eu has already had with dozens of countries all over the earth . 
  are you opposed to all of those agreements ? 
   but i want to say that i think in principle free trade agreements are good . 
  how is ttip a ** free ** - trade agreement ? 
  if it were one , it 'd eliminate all tariffs and trade restrictions , no ? 
   he eu has been screwing africa over with economic partnership agreements can you elaborate on that ? 
  how have those agreements damaged african economies ? 
  you do realize that ttip is merely a trade agreement , right ? 
  it means we 're renegotiating the rules surronding buying and selling products to each other . 
  it will not somehow merge our governments with theirs . 
  do your own research , but be sure to look up the right sources . 
  the media is spewing a whole lot of bullshit regarding ttip . 
  i mean , it 's not even a `` free '' trade agreement , as they say , to begin with . 
  other than that , the fears that ttip will somehow undermine democracy and force poisonous chicken down our throat are unfounded horseshit . 
  i mean , europe does that too . 
  if german police decides to drive german cars , you guys should be driving american ones . 
  it 's only fair . 
  where do you get this information from ? 
  how do measure the `` quality '' of regulation and where does it say that the eu has better standards than the us ? 
  then do n't go there and do n't buy their products . 
  but do n't force your bullshit on other people . 
  i want to buy american products . 
  fracking was invented in 1947 and since then , there have been millions of drillings , not a single one of which has polluted ground water supplies that are actually used for drinking water . 
  the stuff being injected into the ground during the drilling is 98 % water and sand anyway . 
  the flammable gas coming from water wells as shown in gasland are the result of ** naturally occurring ** methane . 
  that 's why people have been able to do this is areas where there is no fracking . 
  here is a thorough [ debunking of the film ] ( http://energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/debunking-gasland.pdf ) . 
  no , it would not . 
  it says that the government ca n't discriminate against companies from other countries that are part of the agreement . 
  have you seen any of the countless debunkings of gasland ? 
   it 's a shame it is n't enacted yet . 
  otherwise volkswagen could sue the us for billions .
