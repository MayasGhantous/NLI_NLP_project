thanks man . 
  i can whole-heartly agree to anything you said . 
  got any examples for your claims ? 
  thanks very much , but ther source is from 2012 and just says , that they have been sentenced to death , but not theat they have been executed . 
  and i heared about diffrent cases , where people have been sentenced but the order never got carried out . 
  do n't get me wrong , the situation of homopsexuals in iran is horrible , but i still think the statement of / u/kahzootoh  the iranian government routinely hangs people for being homosexuals is false . 
  give ** one ** source for iran hanging gay people . 
  last thing i can remember was in 2005 and that guy was guilty of raping a 13 year old . 
  something i think a lot of your fellow countrymen would love to extend your own deathpenalties on . 
   so who was it then ? 
  the rebels suddenly had the capability to make sarin gas ? 
  or steal it ? 
  without anyone , not even assad knowing ? 
  ** i do n't know ** , but i think neither do you . 
  just that you sell speculations as facts is what irks me . 
  on the topic of speculations , one could argue , that it ** would ** make sense for the anti-assad troops to use sarin ( which was used on ** civilians ** and not the rebels got bombed ) , especially when there are un workers close by , to lure the west into the conflict . 
  but those are just ** speculations **  you sound like the russians and ukrainian rebels that claim that ukraine downed mh17 , because no report actually proves the russians did it . 
  again doses of intellectual dishonesty . 
  again speculations . . * you sound like . . * is that really the way you argue ? 
  this time speculations on my opinion about something more or less unrelated . 
  the closest relation i can see is that you need to put people on different sides and ca n't think of individuals , that like to think for themselves and try to base their opinion on facts . 
  do you realize how many wrong statements you made in your last posts ? 
  doses of intellectual dishonesty manifest in my view exactly in the way you part took in this conversation . 
  it took this long , till you finally got what i said ( i hope so by now ) . 
  intellectual dishonesty is selling speculations as fact , which is just what the average conspiracy nut is doing . 
  on a side note - sarin is not that hard to produce . 
  the first documented victims of it have been 19 roman soldiers in the yead 250 a.d. 
  and where is the part about ** who ** used the gas , mhm ? 
  where is it ? 
  yes the un is a reliable source , that ** does n't ** say , that assad is responsible for the attack . 
  i never doubted that there has been a use of sarin . 
   fine , it was n't mustard gas , it was sarin . 
  that makes it so much better , to use nerve gas . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is , that there are no reliable sources that can say : assad did it . 
  and frankly , it does n't make any sense for him to do it . 
  but i guess i am done writing with someone , who is not able to read and prefers feelings over facts . 
  ok , first of all i am not trolling and i never told you stuff . 
  most of the time i just asked question . 
  now i have another question : do you think you can manage to not get outraged and try to maybe answer those questions ( if only for yourself ) and please stop suggesting , that i told how things are and so on ... 
  i asked for a source to back up your very serious claim , that the syrian government gased it 's own people . 
  you did not bring a source , instead you emotionalize the discussion and than you are making ** false ** statements . 
   are you telling me syria did n't let independent investigators check war torn regions for use of mustard gas ? 
  omg . 
  i am shocked . 
  not only did they let independent investigators in the country when they could guarantee their safety , but during the gas attacks there have been un-inspectors only a few kilometers away . 
  why do n't you at least read the wikipedia article on the incident ? 
  here i made a [ link for you ] ( are you telling me syria did n't let independent investigators check war torn regions for use of mustard gas ? 
  omg . 
  i am shocked . ), 
   they 're using rape on women to intimidate . 
  are you comparing that with guantanamo ? 
  who uses rape ? 
  the syrian army or isis ? 
  or the fsa or the peshmerga , any sources ? 
  i do n't compare that to guantanamo , but abu ghraib [ would be fitting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abu_ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse ) . 
   210.000 civilians died in the syrian civil war it 's an estimated 100k-600k dead civilists in the irak-warii and another 150k in afghanistan . 
   i tend to think that a country that mustard bombs its own citizens did n't start out as a shining example of an illustrious democracy . 
  do you have any source on that ? 
  because as far as i know , there has not been any hard evidence to back up that claim . 
   and are you comparing the syrian situation ( even before the war ) with europe or the us ? 
  are you being serious ? 
  no , i did not compare the syrian situation with the eu or us . 
  i just said , that syria might violate human rights , just as the us or eu did/does . 
  : declaring an unlawful war against souvereign nations . 
  using uran-ammunition and `` daisycutterbombs '' . 
  assasinating targets all around the globe without trial and yeah . . than there is that guantanamo thing . 
  in conclusion i just wanted to say , that if you point with one finger at smb else , there are 3 fingers pointing at yourself . 
   are you implying there are n't three sides of the syrian conflict ? 
  what would make you think that ? 
  there are most defentitly at least 3 sides . 
  i was just wondering , what you think are the `` anti-assad '' groups . 
  the old fsa does not exist anymore and the groups are not as much anti as they are pro their own agenda afaik . 
  can you name them ? 
  isis is anti-assad too . 
  what human right abuses ? 
  and on another note , which developed nation does n't ( sadly ) ? 
   when they wo n't even fight for their own country ? 
  jeeez , please read up on the background of this conflict . 
  and when you finished i am eager to learn , what you think which party would be those to chose to `` fight for the syrian country '' . 
  i will . 
  so pubs for steak stuff and fish and chips in little `` fish 'n chips '' shops ? 
  do you know any details about the reforms ? 
  which are the necessary reforms and which are bad ? 
  are you an economist ? 
  varoufakis is one and a highly decorated btw , much more than sch\u00e4uble btw . 
  one of the major reasons germany is so successfull is the `` l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich '' , meaning every state in germany helps the other , the rich ones give the most and the poor ones get most out of it . 
  this way bavaria went from beeing an agrar state full of farmers to a very highly industrialized area in about 20 years . 
  this all is in the sense of a `` soziale marktwirtschaft '' or john maynard keynes , whose theorys most successful countrys used . 
  and they basicly say when times are bad you need to spend money and when they are good safe as much as possible . 
  exactly what germany is doing . 
  `` konjunkturpaket i&ii '' during the crisis and after that a `` schuldenbremse '' into the `` grundgesetz '' . 
  in greece we try it the other way around . 
  what exessive welfare system are you speaking of ? 
  they do n't even have social security . 
  the only thing are pensions and they function as a social security , most of the time not only used for 1-2 persons , but for a whole family ( in a country with 30 % unemployment ) . 
  edit : if you come up with numbers can you please cite sources . 
  i get two diffrent numbers with two diffrent meaning without sources from you guys . 
  also i have the feeling that you count pensions into welfare , which they are clearly not . 
  i ca n't tell you how much i am pissed at fish and chips .
