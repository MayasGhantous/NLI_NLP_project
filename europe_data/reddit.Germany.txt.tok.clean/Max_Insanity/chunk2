  each millenia old concept based on no merit but supposed divinity , like the holy texts , comes with their own problems and flaws . 
  that the problems of islamic doctrine and the quran just happen to be the most problematic at this moment does n't mean that it is inherently * worse * . 
  all holy texts are bad and someone interpreting the bible literally is just as bad as someone doing the same with the quran . 
  ( full disclaimer : i think they are all complete rubbish , but that 's just my opinion . 
  the rest , however , regarding the equivalence of potential evil present in all religions , is fact . ), 
  you know , i ca n't downvote such a good joke , but ... * holy fuck , dude !, 
  i would n't even know where to begin . 
  i just decided i wo n't waste my time , but i do want to say that i strongly disagree without on pretty much all points . 
  there is a third way . 
  mourn the dead but not to be afraid because the likelyhood of a terrorist killing you is insignificant to the likelihood of something mundane killing you ( like a car , a stroke , an accident , whatever ) . 
  and when it comes to what you 're going to do about the terrorists , show them that we are better than them . 
  that our culture is superior , by far . 
  right now , we are n't doing that . 
  we are n't living to our full potential . 
  we should aid those who are in poverty , get our shit together , educate ourselves better and be overall better people . 
  hard for a lot of parts in the u.s. , to be sure , but also for a lot of countries here in europe . 
  when they see that being our friend is so much better than being our enemy and that they have no need to be afraid of us , many of them will come around . 
  we should also support those in these countries who speak out for peace , moderation , secularism and diplomacy . 
  the way some of my countrymen ( and - women ) stand in regards to refugees and the like is disgusting . 
  oh , my apologies then . 
  many people make such mistakes because they simply do n't care , creating unnecessary confusion , not because of an understandable error , so i get a little kick out of calling them out . 
  that obviously does n't apply to you , sorry . 
  are we talking eastern europe or countries to the east of the u.s. ? 
  because germany is n't in the eastern part of europe . 
  in germany they are called `` pfadfinder '' - pathfinders . 
  aaaah , and now you 've gone and made me feel bad for laughing ... you know we already do that so little . 
  well , it is important in this case . 
  if that info was omitted , people would grow xenophobic sentiments . 
   you do n't get my point . 
  it 's one issue to have fertility rates below replacement levels and than another issue * then i thought i 'd be content with just correcting your grammar , rather than your content , seeing as it costs far less effort and time considering how far gone it is . 
  well , you are n't * wrong * . 
  at this point , anything is possible . 
  firstly , that still has no bearing on wether or not people want to leave the country and second of all , i never said that fearmongering was n't effective . 
  just that all these things that are being perpetuated by some idiots and/or assholes ( including the usual suspects like `` bild '' ) are just that - fearmongering . 
  i 'm in germany . 
  i have n't heard of a single person who wants to leave germany . 
  estimates are that * up to * ** one ** million people are going to come into germany , not `` millions '' of people . 
  we have a population of 80 million , a demographic shift that means we need young people desperately and despite all the fearmongering , the events on new years eve are the `` only '' bad things that have happened so far . 
  there is no threat of sharia law becoming law here . 
  there is no dispropotionate rise in crime ( refugees are n't more likely to commit crimes as our own people ) . 
  in fact , live is still as it has been before . 
  before it was refugees , it was greece . 
  before that , it was russia with crimea . 
  before that , it was something else . 
  there will always be fearmongering in the media because that sells issues and gets you lots of clicks . 
  the truth is , for one of the most powerful and rich industrialised nations on this planet , 1 million refugees are a challenge , but not something truly dangerous . 
  reading the title , i thought donald trump might have finally said something smart by accident . 
  he immediately proved that hope wrong . 
  oh , i 'm not saying we are n't compassionate or that taking in refugees is stupid . 
  just that people in general are . 
  they are fucking assholes for creating that situation in the first place . 
  this is as though your roommate had a huge party , thrashed the place and then calls you stupid for cleaning up his mess ( which is necessary ) . 
  did you even read past the first line ? 
  yeah , luckily , people over here in germany are n't as stupid as americans . 
  not quite as much at least ... or not quite as large a percentage ... you know what , nevermind , forget i ever said anything . 
  edit : ok , to avoid confusion , i do n't mean that it 's stupid to accept refugees , i mean that we did one smart thing and that means we are n't as stupid as americans . 
  but then , i remembered a lot of people that live here , those on the far right and ... well , it 's not quite an honest statement . 
  the whole point is that they are against it * becoming * scarce . 
  * facepalm *, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irony the level of your stupidity is staggering . 
  it 's simply not true . 
  at all . 
  not entirely true , though . 
  religion in it 's extreme forms persists and sometimes , when the fate of the world is at stake , we do n't have time to wait for older generations to die out ( like with climate change ) . 
  the problem is that our government signed a binding contract and we would just `` back out '' . 
  that would ruin our international reputation and make it harder for us to act in our foreign policy . 
  i 'm not saying it 's impossible or , given the situation , undesirable , but why let it progress to that point in the first place ? 
  we need n't discuss how to extinguish a fire that has n't even started yet and that we can still prevent from happening . 
  because germany could show the rest of europe * and * the u.s. the finger at the same time and there wo n't be any negative repercussions . 
  it 's one thing if our politicians say that they ca n't agree due to public pressure . 
  it 's another if they agree and then back out, 
  fracking was only mentioned to support my argument , it was n't the argument itself which you did n't adress . 
  but i do know about fracking , i know it can be used responsibly , but trying to do so is always a gamble and a lot of the chemicals end up in the groundwater . 
   you claim to be respecting the legacy of marx , but you instead rally behind positions that are an anathema to his legacy . 
  you celebrate stagnant wages and a structural surplus that drives millions of europeans into poverty . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  i never said that the left is * stronger * than neo-liberalism , the cdu or anything like that . 
  but the spd has a huge problem because it promised to never ally with `` die linke '' ( transl . 
  `` the left '' ) party and because of that has no chance to gain a majority any more . 
  you are talking out of your ass if you claim to know my personal political association because i have n't even stated it yet and you base your whole argument on a misunderstanding , of which i have no idea how you could have come to it . 
  i said `` we see what the ttip is for '' implying that that is why we are against it . 
  did you even read what i wrote ? 
  wow , pretty much all of what you said is complete nonsense . 
  if i want something changed , i need to convince people that it needs changing . 
  that is one of the principle ideas of democracy , that you ca n't just come and make a decision against the will of the people . 
  i would n't want some corporation deciding what is good for me , i want to decide that for myself and , seeing as i live in a society and am not the only one in this country , compromises need to be made . 
  yes , that means that sometimes things will pass that i dislike , but it also means that other things go my way that others oppose . 
  ... wait , did you just bring me to explain democracy as a concept to you like you were a 9 year old ? 
  ... and break international law in the process . 
  it is already well known that the tpp and ttip will have those corporation courts as one of the provisions . 
  look in this thread , others have put it much more elegantly and thoroughly than i could . 
  that 's like a heroin addict telling his ivy league roomate to get his shit together if he has come back froma night of drinking once . 
  you guys literally have flammable water coming out of your faucets . 
  if you knew anything about germany , you 'd know how bananas people here are when it comes to the environment . 
  there 's a reason we are among the world leading in green technologies . 
  one firm doing one bad thing once does not set a trend ( and i say that as someone who is definitely not as crazy about cars as so many of my fellow germans are ) . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** yes , what vw did is serious , but the u.s. are far , * far * worse offenders environmentally overall than germany . 
  i like you . 
  and your username . 
  you put it much more concisely than i could :d,
