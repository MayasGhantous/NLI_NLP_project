my blond baby son was photographed several times by italians while we ( german/scottish family ) were on holiday in emilia romagna . 
  i was on vacation in southern italy with a girl with really long and blond hair . 
  the italian girls all wanted to touch it and complemented her for her awesome hair . 
  my parents took me to neuschwanstein when i was 2 years old and while i could walk i was unable to go down the stairs . 
  so i just sat down in the highest stair and slided down on my ass . 
  a few chinese tourists asked if they could film me doing so and they allowed it . 
  another time i was on a traditional volksfest with a few friends and we all wore dirndl . 
  a few tourists asked if they could make a selfie with us . 
  yes . 
  honestly it 's really easy to get pepper spray labled as animal defence spray in germany . 
  the problem is only , that if you use it unreasonable , you could be charged for assault . 
  the problem is if it used irresponsible like in american movies . 
  i do n't know if this happens in real life tho . 
   and * illegal * drugs ftfy, 
  meanwhile my dad had to built a crossbow in school classes , when he was a child . 
  he still has it . 
  different country , different time i guess . 
  pepper spray can be potentially harmful if you do n't know how to safely use it . 
  it also can harm the `` attacker '' . 
  bavaria/s serious answer : probably eastern germany since i speak the language and the culture is n't that different from mine or poland 'cause i got family there and speak a few words polish , which wo n't be enough for a job or real chats , but is better than nothing . 
  $ $ $ $ wo n't help if you do n't fix corruption with it , they just push problems into the future . 
  germany : eagle - boring , everybody and their moms have a eagle bavaria : lion - same as the eagle lower bavaria : panther - i like it . 
  nobody ever heard about it and its pretty much only used in bavaria and austria . 
  the panther is a symbol of christianity and has a nice backstory . 
  depends on the person . 
  i live in a pretty rural area . 
  i never saw anybody come out as trans , but i would guess , that most older people would find it weird and talk behind their back while younger adults and teenagers would either not care or support them or be completely disgusted . 
  i do n't think anybody would say something like that into the face of the person , because that would be considered rude , but it would gain negative attention . 
  i personally do n't see a problem with being trans and would support a transition even as a teenager . 
  yeah , triebwerke was a awesome album . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3vn4kzv0uq ) song is one of his first that got recognition . 
  it 's from `` in gottes namen '' and he still used his kaliba 69 ( a islamist and terrorist ) persona back then . 
  [ alligatoah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=styo0zpvj0s ) < 3 [ trailerpark ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc-yuypsxk4 ) , [ kiz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgpbbwt1w ) , [ dicht und ergreifend ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gggf_osdfr0 ) , [ antilopengang ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnllr7zvec8 ) and [ 257ers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drfsxlchrwc ) are pretty good as well . 
  maybe because most parts of austria like big parts of bavaria speak bairisch ( bayrisch does n't exist ) ? 
   when is a child old enough to pick out their own clothes ? 
  i do n't really remember not picking my own chlothes , so i guess i was 6 year old . 
   fix their own food ? 
  i was probably 5/6 years old  play outside alone ? 
  6 years old  visit a friend 's house alone ? 
  7/8 years old  go to the shops alone ? 
  there was only the local bakery and i was 7 when i first went their with my bike in order to get my grandma bread and stuff like that . 
   ride transit ? 
  there was n't really any transit , but i did my first train ride without adults to munich ( 2 hours ) when i was 13 . 
   go to a friends house/the shops without asking ? 
  i was probably 7/8  be in a relationship ? 
  i did n't ask  be in a physically intimate relationship ? 
  again , i did n't ask  in school : leave campus for lunch ? 
  6th grade , 11/12 years old  go to the bathroom without asking ? 
  5 years old , maybe ? 
   general freedom of movement ? 
  ugh , i do n't know . 
  but there are pictures of 3 year old me getting myself my own milk , so fairly early i guess  do you feel children in your culture are given a shorter or a longer leash than others ? 
  a longer own ps : i really do n't remember not doing most of this stuff myself so i often had to guess . 
  everytime i visit a city ( for school or other reasons ) . 
  i have to drive an hour to the next university and live in place that basically consists of many many villages with one `` city '' that has a few schools and shops . 
  pretty common . 
  i know a lot vegetarians , a few vegans and one pescetarian . 
  i am from the countryside , but most of my friends are educated and young , so i may be in a bit of a bubble . 
  there is [ viennacomicx ] ( https://viennacomix.at/austrian-superheroes-captain-austria-donauweibchen-lady-heumarkt/ ), 
  some kickstarter tries currently makes a german comic series called [ liga der deutschen superhelden ] ( http://ligadeutscherhelden.de ) e : hauptmann deutschland is actually part of it, 
  there us also hauptmann deutschland , but he was just in a few captain america comics a few centuries ago and a one-panel cameo in an avengers comic, 
  die eisb\u00e4ren have the [ best song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bps7ljgav9g ) after all . 
  i also know my kinda home team and i am really not into sports . 
  i also know several people who watch ice hockey . 
   and what kind of a fucking name is `` rudolf '' anyway ? 
  it 's pretty common in germany . 
  i got several male family members with the name . 
  a common nickname for people called rudolf is rudi . 
  i always ask for tap water and it 's 50/50 . 
  tbf nobody cares about age boundaries in the internet . 
  studivz had way to many creeps . 
  i used to have a profile when i was like 12 and being female i got a fucking lot sexual messages . 
  really creepy . 
   projectors in every classroom we have them , they are often used by teachers and do improve the lessons . 
  in bavaria it 's 50/50 german and bavarian flags, 
  neither did i and i am still at school . 
  i honestly never saw a kid using them . 
  they just seem to not be popular in germany . 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/bairisches_mundartgebiet.png ) , most austrian dialects are actually bavarian ( bairische ) dialects . 
  but you were n't the eastern realm of bavaria since 1156 . 
  swabian , just really really cute , they sound like a bunch of toddlers, 
  in my city it 's tradition to wear a bib-and-brace overall and then go to the volksfest which happens to be a few days after graduation , get drunk and then let friends and acquaintance sign your bib-and-brace overall . 
  what ? 
  the usa made it possible for germany to build itself up though investments and by integrating it in the western society . 
  it was a political ally and without their help germany would have never been able to become what now is . 
  but the marshall plan was more symbolism than anything else . 
  i am just saying , that a marshall plan for africa wo n't help that much , africa needs investments and political allies . 
  you even sometimes hug strangers , if they you both are pretty young and get introduced by a friend or family . 
  the money of the marshall plan did n't really help post-war europe as well , it just was n't enough money , it was investments by americans , that really helped . 
  french are n't good drivers either but italians are on a whole other level of bad driving skills . 
  sweet mustard, 
  what 's the problem with lindt, 
  i live in a small town with a lot refugees , so i met and talked with a lot refugees from different places . 
  some were nice or cool and i became friends with them , others were assholes or just boring . 
  not really different to `` natives '' . 
  a lot were young men ( tbf they are the demographic , that is most likely to be in the town center or at parties ) , but i also met young woman , old man or woman and many little children . 
  i actually know a syrian guy , who flew from turkey to greece by plane and then proceded to travel to germany by foot + car . 
  lucky for him he looked really european and therefor got himself a fake eu id , 'cause otherwise he probably would n't have been able to use the plane . 
  /  germans who claim , that everything that does n't happen in their part of the country , is n't actually german . 
  booohhh,
