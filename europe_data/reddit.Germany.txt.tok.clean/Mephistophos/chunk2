  to cite my former driving instructor : `` why do leftys call me a racist ? 
  i just hate blacks . '', 
  anyway yes i met a few people , that i would consider racist or far right . 
  some guy who hit on me turned out to like hitler a bit too much and went on pegida demonstrations , i met an other guy who was actually kinda cool , but said that he had problems with his center-left father 'cause he himself is far-right and had an older version of the german flag hanging in his room . 
  the brother of a friend of mine regularly visits far-right and neo-nazi parties . 
  i also have classes with a guy who thinks that you could heal gays with hormones and regularly makes quiet racist comments . 
  0 neither pure milk nor dairy products or any other products that contain milk, 
  it 's just the standard version , which is based on hochdeutsch aka southern german dialects . 
  this is actually the reason why most northern germans lost their dialect . 
  at least in bavaria austrians and german-speaking swiss are the exception . 
  i feel like it 's kinda immigrant = non-native speaker, 
  / u/cmfg , you were right . 
  dach-nations unite ? 
  ugh copypasting a low-effort comment . 
  to drink beer in moderation  in massen bier drinken . 
  to drink beer en masse, 
  we had an environmental club and a few other clubs for school activities ( street art - painting the walls in the school , school garden club - working in the school garden etc. ), 
  i am from the south , i have never seen a potato salad with mayonnaise . 
  vinegar and mustard are the ingredients of a good potato salad . 
  saturday night : maibaum stehlen ? 
   potato salad . 
  but with mayonnaise . 
  sorry , i clicked on the wrong comment, 
  there are also a few words that made it into bavarian dialect but not standard german . 
  the [ guglm\u00e4nner ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2014/jun/08/guglmanner-bavaria-black-hooded-secret-independence-movement ) believe that king ludwig ii was killed by prussian agents , 'cause he apparently tried to regain bavaria 's independence with the help of france . 
  a lot antifacists and lefties believe , that the verfassungsschutz ( german government institutions who fights extremist groups ) helped finance the neonazi terrorist group [ nsu ] ( https://www.nsu-watch.info/2014/02/the-continuing-scandal-of-the-national-socialist-underground/ ) and then tried to get rid of the evidence . 
  you sometimes also add mustard . 
  wow , it 's true . 
  britons do have a bad taste when it comes to drinks/food . 
  do americans also speak ancient asian languages as mother language or do you read the english translations of ancient asian languages ? 
  'cause op seems to be talking about the former . 
  sorry , i was talking about distilling . 
  no idea , but i know a lot people who brew ( edit : distilling ) at home and do n't pay anything . 
  i just googelt `` bratwurst '' and `` oktoberfest '' and apperently there is a wirtshaus called `` zur bratwurst '' at oktoberfest . 
  [ osterlamm ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/rezepte/110/110354/890680-960x720-osterlamm-und-osterhase.jpg ) you can either bake it yourself and bring it to mess were they get blessed or buy blessed ones from the church after mess . 
  luxury, 
  we have an anthem problem ? 
  bavaria wins with 170 liter a year per person . 
  [ beerwiki ] ( http://beer.wikia.com/wiki/bavaria ), 
  `` a ma\u00df '' gets you 1 litre beer and `` a hoibe '' if you want half a litre beer . 
  you guys call auszongne bauern ?

  every time i am in austria they just ask `` sparkling or still ? 
  '' , the same in germany . 
  the oldest traces of settlement are from about 4000 bce , the village was probably founded around ~ 1200 ace . 
  there were a few celtic settlements which left traces in the fields that can only be seen if you fly over them . 
  there were also some roman villas and the mountain slope next to the village is still called wine mountain since the romans used to grow wine on it . 
  the next city was founded in 1224 but there already used to be a village with the same name which was first mentioned in 1071 and the area was settled for at least 5000 years . 
  as somebody who does n't care about football , i love it when people start to chant `` oleoleoleoleohhh bvb hurens\u00f6hne '' at the end of concerts especially when the band consists of bvb-fans . 
  they always look butthurt . 
  we could call it `` edelwei\u00dfland '' ( i 'd prefer gro\u00dfbaiern , but i fear the other members would n't agree ) . 
  the capitel could be either liechtenstein or salzburg . 
  yeah , it 's better to just avoid brandenburg . 
  after wwii a third of the cities population were refugees from the former german regions . 
  so a whole new district was build by these refugees . 
  half of the streets in the district are named after the regions these refugees came from , examples : silesian street , danziger street , sudeten street , k\u00f6nigsberg street , breslauer street ... 
  also north vs. south, 
  and german ... 
  ludwig ii of bavaria - the fairytale king, 
  [ 257ers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bnn8at7tos ) [ alligatoah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vscvdooucta&amp;oref=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dvscvdooucta&amp;has_verified=1 ) [ trailerpark ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eac-2tthcyk ) [ kiz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgpbbwt1w ) [ dicht und ergreifend ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gggf_osdfr0 ), 
  on `` unsinniger donnerstag '' ( nonsensical thursday ) pupils wear costumes to school and prank their teachers . 
  [ marianne + bavaria ] ( http://de.academic.ru/pictures/dewiki/77/marianne_kurzinger_gallia_schutzt_bavaria_1805.jpg ), 
  same . 
  the village is also next to a river and a few lakes with a lot of fish and it is surrounded by cultivated fields . 
  and there a lot forests with deer and mushrooms in it and most inhabitants go mushroom hunting or fishing . 
  * learn irish * start a sub in irish * use / r/irland as a filter for yanks * drink beer, 
  i 'd say center-left . 
  there few people with far-left positions . 
  there 's also this little poem :  opel ist popel ,  popel ist dreck ,  dreck wirft man weg . 
  which translates to  opel is booger  booger is dirt  dirt get 's thrown away, 
  my grandma was still a child when the war ended . 
  her village was liberated by american soldiers and they were really nice to the kids and gave them sweets . 
  the nazis on the other hand had forced the villagers to defend their village against the far superior american troops ( some guy tried to raise the white flag from the church tower but the nazis who were sent to the village in order to defend it threatened to shoot him if he did so ) she has a high opinion of the usa and a rather low one of the nazis . 
  she fears the far-right and the rise of the german right-wing party afd . 
  i remember that year . 
  we had to go to school despite the temperature and only the informatics class rooms had ac . 
  the biology room was especially bad 'cause there were solar panels on the school 's roof who would reflect the sunlight into it . 
  [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 ) is pretty good but keep in mind that it is pretty pro-german-government . 
   when you do that , it 's absolutely mandatory to look the person whose glass you 're clinking into the eyes . 
  luckily this does n't exist in my region . 
  edit : you are n't allowed to wish somebody `` happy birthday '' before they have birthday , 'cause doing so would be challenging fate and may 'cause them to die before their birthday . 
  but goa\u00dfma\u00df ... 
  no , i remember envying children from vienna , lower austria and burgenland a few years ago . 
  even worse when they act like merkel is some kind of dictator and responsible for every fucking thing that happens in germany . 
  would be the formal version , right ? 
  we learned about different methods of farming and how to economically farm in different parts of the world , but never put it into practise . 
  we also learned about different kinds of native trees , mushrooms and animals and how to identify them but only in theory . 
  * federal republic of germany, 
  i like `` european federation '', 
  and oberpfalz in bavaria, 
  i 've been there at least three times . 
  it is amazing . 
  my school has a flag pole , but they only fly flags on special occasions . 
  if they did fly flags , they mostly had the european , the german and the bavarian . 
  sometimes only two of them . 
   in bavaria , there is still some nostalgia for ludwig ii , but that 's just that , nostalgia the k\u00f6nigstreuen mostly want ludwig ii 's grave opened in order to investigate his death and if he was murdered ( as they believe ),
