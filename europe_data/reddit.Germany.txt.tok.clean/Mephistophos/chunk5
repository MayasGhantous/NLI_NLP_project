  die linke is kinda pro-russia ? 
  neither switzerland nor turkey are in the eu , but the baltics ( of whom only 1/3 are shown ) , malta , cyprus and a lot countries in the balkans are , but they are n't part of the map . 
  germany has a really big russian community , maybe even bigger than the turkish one . 
  france seems to be much worse . 
  the biggest problem in agriculture is n't the wage , but that the truck driver would be unemployed during the winter months or has to get a job as a truck driver in other fields during winter . 
  unfortunately most other firms just get one for the whole year . 
  really ? 
  i was mostly in tourist towns in the west and more rural places in the east , so that could be the reason . 
  the streets are way better nowadays . 
  i used to visit family in lublin every year as a child and the streets got better and better over time . 
  it made the trip way more comfortable and shorter . 
  most big streets are on level with german streets nowadays , the only exceptions seem to be small towns in eastern poland . 
   it still means you get free infrastructure and poland did really need new infrastructure . 
  the streets used to be dreadful . 
  i disagree . 
  the russian song was boring af ( but i loved the performing ) and the ukraine song was way better . 
  i voted for austria , but ukraine definitely had a good song . 
  i agree that ukraine 's song should n't have been part of the competition for being political , but it deserved the first place . 
  the last place is already ours . 
  we want a triple . 
  that 's weird . 
  that one 's unfair . 
  the germans were just defending themselfs against the roman hords . 
  or should poland pay for germanys lost soldiers in the wws ? 
  and the 30 years war . 
  the swedendrunk was pretty gruesome . 
  bavaria wants reperations !, 
  you do n't speak for all of bavaria . 
  maybe rightwing man are more likely to vote afd , while rightwing woman are more likely to vote cdu, 
  there is no english wikipedia article for the guy . 
  he was a catholic pastor who spoke out against the nazis and died in dachau because of that . 
  [ even more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_euthanasia_and_the_catholic_church ) [ and more ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/johann_baptist_huber ) in order to break reddit 's `` the nazis were catholic '' - circlejerk . 
  they remember the dead soldiers of both wars , wwi and wwii . 
  that 's all ? 
  i know a lot german villages and cities who do this for the fallen soldiers of both wws . 
  in fact i was at a few of these messes . 
  53 days `` floyddit dick eating bet on french election . '', 
  i feel with you . 
  the german election is two months before my 18th birthday . 
  an afd-supporter claimed the same about merkel . . 
  they also trade a lot with bavaria . 
   people in northern bavaria do n't even talk a dialect anymore dude , that 's so wrong . 
  they do n't speak bairisch , they actually never spoke bavarian , 'cause they are franks and therefore talk franconian , claiming otherwise is just wrong . 
  `` southermost '' means about half of bavaria , which is a region half the size of the country of austria and the other parts of southern germany are still cuturally closer to austria than northern germany , they just are n't the same folk like baiern , but germany constists of many different german folks with different culture etc.

  honestly i 've only heard poles claiming that while i am in poland , my polish mum , who lived in germany for years never experienced that . 
  how about doing neither ? 
  i do n't feel guilty about the holocaust and do n't feel pride because of bismarck 's social reforms or goethe , schiller . . 
  they shut down the ski lifts in maria alm on saturday , 'cause the wind was so strong . 
  [ the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1xvrryr93o ) also thanks to martin sonneborn for providing it . 
  if you sign a paper that says `` i am going to have sex with you under this terms '' then you lose right over your body and have to go through it . 
  you do n't sign that paper if you disagree with it . 
  simple . 
  and now its ok to rape a prostitute . 
  how is that different to a prostitute , that decides half way in the act of sex , that she does n't want to any more ? 
  should the costumer be allowed to just rape her , since he already paid her for the service ? 
  same in southern germany . 
  am german youth , did know the term . 
  `` das '' and `` dass '' is really easy in my case , since my dialect uses `` des '' instead of `` das '' and `` das '' instead of `` dass '' . 
  and einfalt means naivety . 
  settle people in lower saxony . 
  there was also a [ electricity shortage ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/france-power-winteroutlook-idusl8n1d92v1 ) this winter , 'cause of france dependency on nuclear reactors . 
  france had to import electricity from germany , britain and several other countries . 
   bulette comes from french and was brought to brandenburg by refugees ( huguenots ) . 
  that was like two comments earlier . 
  [ that 's brandenburg ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/brandenburg/@52.4378105,4.0512283,5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a84fede87c369b:0x8122269c3452df8c!8m2!3d52.1313922!4d13.2162494 ) according to op 's map the rest of former east germany seems to prefer klops or other words . 
  bulette comes from french and was brought to brandenburg by refugees ( huguenots ) . 
  luxembourgian borrowed a lot words from french and bulette happens to be one of them . 
  the spd is also more socially progressive than cdu and especially csu . 
  gay marriage , weed legalization and stuff like that is impossible with cdu + csu but i doubt that the spd would block it in a rrg - or ampelkoalition, 
  i am also pretty young and loved the show . 
  kika always aired this kind of shows . 
  our school library had the latin versions , so i tried to read them . 
  unfortunately i was never good in latin . 
   backdate germany 1000 years [ sounds good ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/karte_herzogtum_bayern_im_10._jahrhundert.png ), 
  they made a really bad song even worse . 
  let 's send h\u00f6cke as well or he would just take over afd . 
  your kids go to a weird school . 
  woman seem to be highly unrepresented at reddit and especially / r/de . 
  being a hypocrite and acting stupid = marxist wat ? 
  i thought it was n't used for over 60 years and not part of the anthem since the unification ? 
  no it is n't . 
  it was n't since 25 years . 
  prussia = germany how to annoy a bavarian with just one sentence . 
  according to [ this source ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?catid=469&amp;acro=lmi&amp;lang=de&amp;countryid=uk&amp;regionid=ukm&amp;nuts2code=null&amp;nuts3code=null&amp;regionname=scotland ) scottland has a population of 5,3 million of whom 2,6 million have a job . 
  so scottland will have -0,4 million jobs left after leaving the uk . 
  [ \u00c4 ] ( http://exil-presse.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/merkel.jpg ), 
  tbf i saw ( south ) italiens put french fries on their pizza . 
  also in germany . 
  that sounds really cute . 
  i just ca n't be angry at anybody talking swabian . 
  [ traditional bavarian breakfast ] ( https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/91/05/19/500_f_91051922_gbeyo3ubtdvnfksrfy27y6azj5yfzpff.jpg ), 
  some people already linked two other examples for erdogan , but here is a [ third ] ( https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/file/getimagecustom/7fb27961-1e07-4faf-a04e-72a0d093274c/850/479 ) one . 
  they were actually partly upvoted the first time i visited this thread . 
  the downvotes came later when this thread got more and more attention . 
  belgium was ok , but i disliked the danish one . 
  [ he is technically a islamist ] ( https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/file/getimagecustom/7fb27961-1e07-4faf-a04e-72a0d093274c/850/479 ), 
  tbf bavaria did n't really have a choice .
