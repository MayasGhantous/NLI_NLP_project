  it 's called [ sch\u00fctzenverein ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sch\u00fctzenverein ) in german . 
  but there are gun clubs for that . 
  half of the boys in my village are part of one . 
  valeria is a really badass name . 
  [ bavarian landtag ] ( https://www.bayern.landtag.de/maximilianeum/saeleraeume/ ) , ours is bigger, 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.sat1.de/news/panorama/papst-benedikt-statue-in-altoetting-enthuellt-103095 ) , but not as many as you do . 
  but we have [ cruzifixe in classrooms ] ( http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-82918-860_panofree-wrwq-82918.jpg ) . 
  bavaria had some beef with the [ german government ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kruzifix-beschluss ) because of that . 
  [ we ] ( http://www.altoetting.de/cms/willkommen_tour.phtml ) have something similar, 
  but bavaria is catholic , the prussians up in the north are protestant . 
  yes . 
  maria is the [ personification of bavaria ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/patrona_bavariae ), 
  my mother is a foreigner . 
  so my mother was a car and my dad a human ? 
  am i a transformer ? 
  boy , i live near the czech border and i am pretty sure , that by now it got tradition to do weekend trips to czechia for cheap beer and weed . 
  it 's a propose of a csu politician . 
  i think its just lobbying by the meat industry . 
  but short hair is the stereotype for polish guys and as a german who lives at a place with many polish immigrants and visits poland every summer , i got to admit , that there is some truth in it . 
  if you follow this logic germans also should n't be allowed to criticize sinti , roma , communists , homeless , slavs , gays and a bunch of other people . 
  yeah and you are a germanophobe who thinks that german culture was the reason for hitler and ignores that the dutch were seen as germans for a long time, 
  tbh real communism after marx was never tried . 
  i do n't believe , that marx 's idea of a utopia could work tho . 
  that ai n't true . 
  there are a lot gardens with bavarian or german flags in it . 
  no your beer consumption per capita would have increased since bavarians drink 180l per year , while czechs drink 160l . 
   after so no real solution for the next few years ? 
  fuck , remote shut down of a few cars on the autobahn could cause a lot more than 12 deads ... 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the berlin police did n't release a lot information , but `` we have a suspect '' , `` do n't jump to conclusions '' and `` 12 people died '' . 
  heck there where people complaining about the lack of news released by the police !, 
  they did n't . 
  i did n't try to say that it has been a pole , just that also polish people could do something as terrible as that . 
  also switzerland . 
  there are also polish maniacs and mentally ill . 
  rote armee fraktion ( raf ) and nationalsozialistischer untergrund ( nsu ) were the biggest german post-war terror groups . 
  both were atheist . 
  like half of australia is asian immigrants . . 
   opinion, 
  you do n't even know the guys face or name , bit that he was a refugee ? 
  could we just wait till they got him ? 
  we do n't know if it was a terrorist attack at the moment . 
  no it ai n't . 
  just tell me the context of the quote , if it is real , you should be able to that . 
  that definition just feels odd 'cause most terrorist groups in germany were political motivated raf , nsu . . 
  terrorism does n't need to be religious motivated . 
  you seem to dislike the sub , if you want to fight it , join / r/enoughschulzspam, 
   shultz you are banned from / r/the _ schulz, 
    ** homeless ** communist disabled gay jewish women with romani ancestors, 
   90 % of people in aleppo are happy and thankful for russia . 
   10 % hardcore islamists are feeling terrible . 
  am i the only one , who always feels fremdscham , when somebody posts faked statistics like these ? 
  whoever downvoted op , why ? 
  what part of the comment is wrong ? 
  some german newspapers claimed , that he got radicalised though the internet . 
  also what are they going to do against it ? 
  they may have thought it was just a phase after all . 
  syrians seem to smoke a lot weed tho, 
  'cause we do n't let murder and rapists roam free to kill and rape whomever they want ? 
   a lot, 
  good to know, 
  wait are you deporting people before they served their prison sentence ? 
  honestly , that sounds like a terrible idea . 
  a lot of these people probably made fun of america for having the death sentence a few months earlier . 
  that one looks a lot better . 
   the bible never claimed to be the verbatim word of god . 
  that is wrong . 
  i was a ministrant in a small catholic church for most of my childhood and after hearing them every sunday , i know these words by hearth : `` wort gottes '' - god 's word . 
  the fact , that the bible is god 's word is so important that it is mentioned in every mess . 
  but / r/de is a sub for all german speaking people and let 's be honest , two out of three german speaking countries suck at football . 
  it most likely is . 
  the only source for this is some israeli news paper . 
  it was . 
  it 's called country in german . 
  but let 's be honest , it really just depends on your definition of country . 
  some people would call scotland a country , some would n't . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aiveqmfppk ), 
   i am actually against gmo . 
  that is a completely fair opinion , but there are a lot conspiracies and false information regarding the issue . 
  tbh i am neither for nor really against them . 
  also flat earth , chemtrails , various forms of the sovereign citizens , holocaust ai n't real , vaccination cause autism , climate change ai n't real and gmos cause cancer ,, 
  sounds like berlin, 
  people did n't think that way back than . 
  they were foreigners with different culture and beliefs , the refugees were mostly protestant and often came to catholic villages , who never saw a protestant before . 
  they spoke this weird kind of german and were different , people did n't like that . 
  same could be said about the balkan wars , germany took a lot refugees during that time and the right had the same reaction . 
  this people had a completely different culture , language and beliefs , it was basically the same situation . 
  we just pay italy . 
  we do n't have moose in bavaria , but deer regularly crash from the side into your car , 'cause they start running over the street and ca n't stop fast enough . 
  land means land and deutsch comes from the word teutonic , which was a germanic tribe , the tribe called itself the people ( aka teutonic ) . 
  so land of the people . 
  that 's bs and you know it . 
  there is discussion about politics , culture ad conversation on / r/de , while / r/germany is mostly a bunch of expats and tourists . 
  yeah / r/de has a lot of memes , but is not on the same level as for example / r/kreiswichs . 
  heck / r/de even founded a party : / r/e _ 4, 
  bad infrastructure etc. 
  not really . 
  but the party is generally for a `` peaceful solution '' and `` pro-russia '' . 
  they officially want to copy willy brands ostpolitik . 
  i am suprised to see che\u0142m on a map .
