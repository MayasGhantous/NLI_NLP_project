  the city is really small and shitty . 
  germans are generally more anti-military and so are the parties . 
  but south german , austrian and czechian cusine are related . 
  i hated the advertisement . 
  yeah , that caused a big backlash and say said sorry afterwards . 
  afd is kinda known for shit like this , the voter just do n't seem to care . 
  you can still be for legalization on the basis , that woman would get it done by `` doctors '' illegally otherwise . 
  gysi ai n't anti-german and never said that , like wtf ? 
  also die linke is n't part of the gouvernment . 
  [ no ] ( https://imgur.com/2boppcf ) just let it die !, 
  i am sick of this meme !, 
  that just shows how much you know about german politics . 
  yeah , i love that guy , he is my favourite politician . 
  he is charismatic and rarely populist . 
  it also would be funny to see the afd and npds reaction . 
  \u00d6zdemir for bundeskanzler < 3, 
  more northern = less antibiotics, 
  what ? 
  do you have anything to base this on or is ot just the typical `` everything is germanys fault '' - circle jerk, 
  greater bavaria looks nice . 
  i ca n't believe how many people think the western eu-states would abond the eastern eu-states in case of a russian attack . 
  who cares about facts ? 
  serbs , kebaps , they are the same . 
  also apple, 
  that is the reason trump won ! 11 !!, 
  but the guys in the ddr-gouvernment mostly were n't the same ones fighting the russians ... 
  i know , but they were n't killed by russians . 
  they were the ruling party in the ddr . 
  same with russians in germany . 
  a lot of them vote the pro-putin afd . 
  if i hear this lie one more time , i am going to cry . 
  the spd would have a chance if they manage to get a good candidate which i seriously doubt . 
  thanks, 
   it 's quite sad but also funny , there was a satirical program recently about german politics and how little we know of it . 
  link ? 
   i 'm giving you my vote . 
  tell me your choice . 
  naturally / r/e _ 4 !, 
  like half of our doctors come from countrys east of us . 
  / r/europe and / r/worldnews suscriber . 
  e ^ u ^ a ^ r ^ m ^ y, 
  spending money on refugees rather than on military is seen as more favourable by the majority of the germans . 
  you can argue , which one makes more sense tho . 
  thanks . 
  now i get , why this map is messing with my brain . 
    ** i ** would see it as a symbol that muslims are still welcome  speak for yourself . 
  \u00c4hhh  ** i **, 
  you can learn an other language pretty fast . 
  i 've met my fair share of syrians and they all spoke enough german to at least communicate . 
  `` white '' culture, 
  ah the german race . 
  in southern germany that would be a few really old tribes mixed with celtic tribes who settled afterwards , roman soldiers who came from all over the empire , germanic and slavic tribes who moved there afterwards , people from pretty much all over europe who moved to or through the region 'cause it is in central europe and a transit region , hugenotts ( aka french refugees ) and many many immogrants who came after the wws . 
  so pure, 
  all human races are fictional . 
  bavaria is doing great , so there is n't any reason to change anything . 
  so a bunch of civilians who just want to live their lives and have neither weapons nor allies should join ranks and fight against isis and the syrian army at once . 
  so a limit would just cause more rejected refugees who do n't get deported . 
  worse they are even legitimate refugees who have to fear for their live the whole time just because they were n't fast enough . 
   if they had european values * looks at the thread * i doubt , that most europeans have european values . 
  a lot refugees are young man who would have to fight in the military for a mad-man dictator or terrorist groups and choose to leave the cluster fuck of country they were born in instead of killing civilians . 
  in my and the opinion of most humanitarian organisation this is a legitimate reason for asylum . 
  unfortunately most nations disagree . 
  it 's settelt !, 
  let 's bomb them and let them drown !, 
  refugees in switzerland and other countries who came back to germany after the end of the second world war in order to built a truely humanitarian and democratic state . 
  demonstration = !, 
  concert, 
  go during winter or when the weather is bad . 
  there are no waiting lines at all . 
  i know a lot people who go on a weekend trip to austria every few weeks . 
  you drive about two hours and can do a lot of fun thing during summer and winter . 
  not everyone, 
  that 's not the case . 
  people can either say that they trust the usa or that they do n't , same goes for russia . 
  so the people who currently trust russia are most likely the same that currently trust the usa , these who do n't trust russia are the same that currently do n't trust the usa . 
  that does n't mean , that those who do n't trust both countries do n't trust the usa more then russia . 
  just that they currently do n't trust either country a lot . 
  it 's probably mostly the same people who trust trump 's usa and putin 's russia . 
  so it makes sense that it are the same amount of people . 
  does n't mean , that the average person does n't trust the usa more than russia , just that they have currently little faith in both . 
  slovenia is in the balkans ? 
  i always considered them central european . 
  i learned about 9/11 and the vietnam wars in school but not srebrenica . 
  slaughters are normal people and can kill animals even though the animals do react violently and not bat an eye , because they think of animals as below human . 
  same goes for these soldiers . 
  they have to kill muslims and so in order to manage this , they dehumanize them till they see them as nothing but an animal . 
  just look at a / r/europe thread about refugees in the mediterranean sea . 
  a lot people would happily bomb the boats and just let the refugees drown since they are only `` economic immigrants '' anyway and `` did it to themselves '' . 
  now imagine this on a even bigger level , to somebody who only ever heard how the muslims in kosovo are evil and bad , who is part of a group which threats them like sub-humans , they eventually become subhuman for this person . 
  that is wrong . 
  extremism is n't bad in itself as long as you do n't break the law . 
  feminism would have been considered extremist a long time ago . 
  same goes for black movements in the usa . 
  everybody thinks that one is the center and other people are the extremists . 
  some people would consider vegans or people who want to abolish cars completely extremists . 
  but as long as they do n't break the law , are they really bad ? 
  their ideas may be extreme , but do n't they make sense ? 
  would n't it make the world a better place to follow though ? 
  so a german states . 
  they are called bundesl\u00e4nder ( countries of the union ) in german .
