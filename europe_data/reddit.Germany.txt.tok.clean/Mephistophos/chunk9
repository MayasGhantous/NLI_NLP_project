  hitler believed in different races , that were natural enemies and that killing the jews was self defence , since they would have destroyed the aryans otherwise . 
  he may have been a nutcase , but he was n't a scumbag . 
  his castles now bring wealth to [ e : other ] bavaria and he gave jews equal rights to bavarians . 
  the only time i see something about hungary in reddit , it is because of fearmongering add though your government . 
  so i would n't be surprised if they had something to do with it . 
  at least syrians are the biggest stoners i know . 
  every fucking asylum shelter smells like a reggae festival . 
  that just shows , that you are ignorant of other issues . 
   i 've personally walked through some of stockholm 's `` no go '' zones , and i never felt unsafe . 
  also , the food was great . 
  same . 
  i had the best vegan pizza and awesome sri lanka ( ian ? ), 
  food . 
  10/10 would live under sharia law again . 
  franconia has more beer and we do n't have to travel all the way though swabia in order to get it . 
  hey , they were a gift from napoleon !, 
  they are ours now . 
  oh it was in bavaria . 
  i actually had school that day . 
  it was horrible . 
  germany already takes prosecution based on sexuality as a reason for asylum . 
  lgbt + refugees can also stay in special housing provided by lgbt organisations if they do n't feel safe in asylum shelters . 
  you are getting downvoted :( / r/europe apparently dislikes polyamory, 
  there are also a few smaller developed countries like austria and switzerland left , but it is possible , that the rest of dach follows if germany legalizes gay marriage . 
  preu\u00dfenland sounds better than gro\u00dfpreu\u00dfen , but we can use it for the official english translation, 
   the united kingdom ( s ) of greater bavaria , swabia and prussia ** land ** ftfy, 
  to be fair the political left defines itself by striving for equality in economic and social aspects . 
  so gay rights are by definition left . 
  that does n't mean , that people who are generally right on the political spectrum ca n't support them . 
  i know , i was joking , 
  afd-cdu-csu-linke-coalition , when ? 
  they are awesome if you look for information . 
  especially the pet forums are really good when it comes to tips and recipes . 
  they look like a dick . 
  tbf they are awesome and totally worth the money , i do n't know if you can claim the same for most of northern germany ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  honestly stalin 's genocide happened in an other country , so the german public just does n't care . 
  the same goes for other genocides like the armenian , herero or others . 
  probably not the guy wearing them , they are apparently really comfortable . 
  but i only ever wore dirndl , so i ca n't comment . 
  * lederhosen leder = leather leiden = suffering, 
  hijab is not a burka . 
  we were stuff because we think it is normal . 
  because we were raised this way . 
  so do muslim who are n't forced to but were them nether less . 
  op claimed , that they wear them because they were brainwashed into believing they want to wear them . 
  but they were just raised this way the same way other people are raised wearing the cultural cloths they are used to . 
  i really do n't get your argumentation and am not sure if you are trolling or are actually trying to have a real discussion . 
  'cause what you wrote made little sense to me . 
  certain practices are n't sacred because they are cultural , but they also are n't dammed , just 'cause they are different from the ones you are used tp . 
  imo as long as a custom does n't go against human rights or actively harms a person ( or animal ) there is nothing wrong with it . 
  you did not give any argument against the hijab . 
  you just claimed it is bad 'cause it is in itself bad . 
   a 20-something year old ~ ~ muslim ~ ~ european woman wearing ~ ~ the hijab ~ ~ a bra because ~ ~ she wants to ~ ~ from the day she was born she was brainwashed into thinking she wants to only our customs are normal !, 
  dude i was on vacation in oslo till today and i did walk regularly though gr\u00f8nland , eat there in restaurants and do other stuff . 
  i did not feel unsafe once . 
   `` i wonder why this does n't happen in poland '' and the comment is more often then not made by a pole . 
  far-right western ( and western central ) europeans have no problem with eastern ( and eastern central ) europeans as long a they stay in their countries . 
  that sub is like three cranky americans who post stupid stuff . 
  please make that sub great again . 
  i would love a good european version of / r/sas, 
  i hate cold drinks on hot day . 
  i prefer warm tea or coffee . 
  yeah , there are poor germans living on the street and she wears cloths !!, 
  she should go fkk the whole time till she solved every last problem in the world . 
  we pollute our good white blood with brown skinned people . 
  yeah , nothing could go wrong with this plan / s, 
  alle, 
  there is a lot fishing tourism were i live and if you want to fish in the rivers or lakes you need a fishing license and buy a day ticket from the fishing club . 
  it 's in order to make sure that the waters do n't get overfished . 
  they for sure fish illegal here in bavaria and that 's kinda stealing . 
  emojis and factual wrong information used for a unfunny joke . 
  you should try / r/edefreiheit instead , that should be more of your liking . 
  tschernobyl plays a big part . 
  dach was hit hard by the catastrophe and unlike the eastern block and france the state and media did n't censor it . 
   most people in europe today only think of economics as the primary axis of left/right but that is wrong . 
  otherwise pis would be considered left-wing and the german green party , right-wing . 
  and how could the nazis ever be left-wing , if they did leave the private capital of `` arier '' alone , even if they were rich , but took it away from other `` races '' . 
  they had work-programs , yes , but they also did n't let people work , if they were from a certain race . 
  that does n't look like equality ( and therefore leftwing ) at all . 
  i would rather call it authoritarian . 
  / r/de has little english content . 
   go to the german sub this is n't true . 
  there are two subs , one for foreigners interested in germany ( / r/germany ) and one for german speakers ( / r/de ), 
  the idea that nazis are somehow left-wing shows a bad understanding of the term . 
   left-wing politics supports social equality and equal opportunities , often in opposition to social hierarchy and social inequality . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ page needed ] [ 4 ] it typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others ( prioritarianism ) , as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished ( by advocating for social justice ) . 
  [ 1 ] the term left wing can also refer to `` the radical , reforming , or socialist section of a political party or system '' . 
  [ 5 ] [ wikipedia article about left-wing politics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left-wing_politics ) the whole idea of nazism was a social hierarchy based on race , living style , disability and commitment to the nazi state . 
  not true . 
  i regularly visit eastern poland and people are generally nice . 
  you know , that just shows your own ignorance . 
  same , our teacher told us , that only one of her students failed and he learned how to use a bike just a few months before the test . 
  southern german , we had to do the same . 
  we also had a practical and a theoretic test . 
  you could pass or fail ( i nearly failed cause i drove to fast ) . 
  in the end you just got a piece of paper called fahrradf\u00fchrerschein , which was completely useless . 
  they are also famous for edgy or clickbait covers, 
  i did n't exactly bring german bread with me . 
  after all i can think of better stuff than eating 2 week old bread , just 'cause i do n't want to buy polish one . 
  it just tasted worse .
