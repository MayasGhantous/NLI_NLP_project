thanks for explaining . 
  oh , so is the lowered bit a cargo berth ? 
  seems handy for cranes to sway containers in . 
  i failed.badly .4 / 23 . 
  question , what is up with those ships sporting a long bow , such as the eddystone or anvil point ? 
  left bottom corner . 
  juncker says many things during a day . 
  things seem to have escalated since macedonia ( rightfully ) closed the border . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7omb3jhyg94 ) shows some of the troubled spots . 
  so ... not refugees . 
  the sickeningly sweet and delicious [ biberli ] ( http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/st-gallen-biber.html ) from our neutral neighbours.picked it at random while hungover at a festival and loved it ever since . 
  im certain its taught in some schools , mine however preferred to play hitlerchannel for 5 years.had to learn the rest from documentaries and such . 
  i had exactly one topic in history class ( realschule , high school equivalency ?! ), 
  which was ww2.shortly did ww1 then weimar , back to ww2.i hated history as it was always about the same damn shit , never about romans or some other interesting topic.oh , except the second reich.and how it fell to - the nazis.fuck that guilt driven waste of air . 
  `` family values '' < - thats a damned clichee by now . 
  `` pro-natal '' sounds absurd even on the face of it , let alone as policy in a modern nation . 
  additionally , the comment was to highlight how they 're not at all connected to immigration , or opposition thereof.getting any broad appeal for a group that lumps all of these together is damned hard , even in the current crisis . 
  and stuff like `` value family '' and `` pro-natal '' is why most hesitate to vote any group using these terms , as its usually a thin coating for homophobia and women in the kitchen.germany has one single party ( afd ) that wants to close the borders , yet all the other shit makes them unelectable.might want to consider this , the next time you throw all these into one pot . 
  given my experiences with those people , i really ca n't blame anyone for action against them ( short of extreme harm , obviously ) . 
  well , rather embarrassingly , the czech republic.seeing how they 're neighbours and all , i should kinda know more than `` they enjoy beer '' . 
  great find . 
  the accent as such , yes . 
  apart from hochdeutsch ( the one without an accent as such ) , the accent around vienna comes to mind , although i 'm uncertain why . 
  [ this fellow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biczvlmufy ) is a good example . 
  additionally , it uses a lot of words one might consider old fashioned or a bit stiff to use.enjoyable anyhow . 
  good.another kick in the teeth for berlin to pull its head out of its rear . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weztliubegw ) abhorrence should clarify why dubbing is annoying ... 
  rather than versailles , i much enjoy the historical [ speyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speyer ) , one of the settlements/cities that gave rise to the holy roman empire ( of german nation , later on ) . 
  im certain iceland wont mind . 
  if it takes a mildly scummy group of politicians to adress a blatantly obvious point , it is not the fault of said scummy group.for once . 
  sorry , been ages since i saw it somewhere online . 
  some diplomacy and old fashioned bureaucratic nonsense can work wonders.here 's hoping for the best . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgo7_wnbmry ) illustrates parts of the issue.final recognition of kosovo as an actual ( independent ) nation occurred in 2013 . 
  so , while formally all is fine now , serbian politics seem somewhat touchy about kosovo ( which would make membership of both states a diplomatic masterpiece ) . 
  not saying it wo n't work - i 'm just pessimistic . 
  assuming the nation 's politicians may pull the collective stick out of the collective behind when it comes to kosovo - perhaps . 
  `` sanctions for the others , gas for us '' . 
  well fuck that and our government !, 
  especially considering our former chancellor schr\u00f6der sits in with gazprom , this is just a european embarassment and i welcome each and every hate-filled message . 
  getting really sick of this groko ( gro\u00dfe koalition , grand coalition ) . 
  that is one metal looking coin , i approve !, 
  to be fair , i tacked on ice/winter driving and aquaplaning training.so without my paranoia it might be closer to 2000 . 
  all in all i payed roughly 2300 $ from nothing to license , most of it fees.bare minimum were 12x45 mins of lessons ( nacht , autobahn , \u00dcberland ) , theoretical test followed by the practical test . 
  so , rather thorough . 
  edit , our licenses do not expire.one small advantage . 
  furthermore , the ground will shake and all the heavens shall fall.he is super serial . 
  consisting of an enormous catapult , no doubt . 
  humankind < - see that , you divisive primates ? 
  i do n't care what tribe you belong to , as long as you support the idea and effort behind space exploration , we 're good . 
  so , yay space . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfgang_sch%c3%a4uble#criticism ) outlines some of the authoritarian crap this guy is pushing.to be short , he 's a bitter old man and it shows . 
  i am certain it could , but the cold truth is that nobody wants these people . 
  the problem comes from the migrants legal situation - having to register for asylum in france ( and thus having to stay in france until eu citizenship or deportation ) or reaching britain ( which is rather difficult ) . so , people remain in the giant camp ( known as `` the jungle '' ) and regularly try to cross the channel . 
  france does not round them all up because doing so would require substantial effort , both personnel and financial.further , doing so would require registration of all migrants arrested , which these people want to avoid at all costs , for previously detailed reasons.the gist of it . 
  seems a tad excessive.over here , a speeding ticket ( if not more than 10 km/h above limit ) will cost 25 $ . by comparison this littering fine is rather extreme.good measure by intent though . 
  would have been nice to see nuclear thrown into the mix along with renewables , but no.coal is apparently the way to go for our government.combine that with a somewhat screwy revision of the [ eeg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_renewable_energy_act ) , which did not take into account the need for a reworked powergrid , leading to protests over new power lines ( the old `` not in my backyard '' ) and similar problems that could all have been avoided . 
  we got coal though , so that 's great.all clean and modern.totally not carcinogenic or inefficient . 
  small nitpicking here , it 's `` carpet '' ( teppich ) , rather than `` carped '' ( carp = karpfen ) . 
  oddly enough it was traditionally something cold and quick ( usually potato salad and sausages ) due to the family attending christmas eve service . 
  still the case here , despite not attending church any more . 
  trying to enjoy gl\u00fchwein in 15 \u00b0 c weather , just doesnt feel all that christmasy.heres hoping for better luck next year . 
  dutch is often the first guess , as i live in an accented area ( swabia ) of germany.makes for some awkward conversations online ... `` nope , not dutch ... just a backwoods german '' . 
  the phrase `` slippery slope '' sums up why i think this is a horrible step in the wrong direction . 
  this trash keeps getting reposted , it is neither illegal nor [ unusual ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_service-members'_protection_act ) to have a national court be deemed the highest.it certainly is a dick move , but nothing that will somehow change russian foreign relations and adherence to international law ( or lack thereof ) . 
  impressive collection , making history seem much more alive . 
  this seems oddly familiar , but i must be mistaken.surely the us would only request military aid for a well-planned and executed war in iraq/syria , not some political mess with a thousand different factions to consider.propably with a comprehensive plan to rebuild the place/s with a stable government afterwards . 
  cant wait for the referendum so i do no longer have to read stuff like this.also , please stay . 
  quote : the report does not detail specific recent cases of undetected smuggling of cbrn materials but it uses the 2006 poisoning of alexander litvinenko , who was spiked with polonium in london , as a previous example of such material smuggled into the eu . 
  the report does not give details on the specific cases of chemical , biological , radioactive or nuclear material smuggling into europe . 
  / quote . 
  in other words , some lady said we should be afraid because she said so . 
  as best i recall , berlusconi had neither nukes nor the worlds most powerful military.though `` bunga bunga '' might remain the same . 
  ah , flinten uschi.time for the annual empty promise , is it ? 
  how about we get [ working helicopters ] ( http://www.helipress.it/schede-818-germany_grounds_nh90_helicopters ) first , or [ an actually usable plane ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-19/airbus-said-to-cut-in-half-a400m-deliveries-for-2016-to-germany ) ? 
  not to mention the failure of the eurodrone or the controversy surrounding the g36 ? 
  empty words , again . 
  good.let them create some pressure , hopefully that will finally kick ours in the behind and get them to work on electric vehicles ( ideally affordable ones ) and a common standard.time for our giants to quit dicking around . 
  lovely idea , well executed . 
  that would be the [ unification of germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_germany ) , finally ushering in what is commonly known as `` germany '' . not just [ rheinbund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederation_of_the_rhine ) or [ prussia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussia ) but [ germany !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reich ) edit : as there were requests for `` modern '' details : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8gzptqht68 ) shows one [ g\u00fcnter schabowski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%bcnter_schabowski ) announcing the fall of the berlin wall , earlier than intended , leading to the famous scenes we [ all know ] ( https://youtu.be/fk1mwhedjhg ) . 
  [ therefore , enjoy your anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_mefzb4yzk ), 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  never figured that the whole of europe would be too cold for , well , anything.learned something new . 
  good on ` ya to whoever planted that . 
  so , this is fairly offtopic but i 've noticed avocado are horrendously expensive ` rought my european corner.what gives ? 
  ca n't they be grown in europe ? 
  sorry for offtopic , figured one `` exotic fruit guy '' might know about another , 
  i despise the bnetza because they are at best incompetent , at worst a haven for lobbyists.now , sources in english are ( understandably ) barely existent , but [ here ] ( https://www.dslweb.de/news/dsl/vectoring-streit-bundesnetzagentur-hat-entscheidung-gefaellt-07041602.html ) is an example of them effectively hindering fiber ( netzausbau anyone ? 
  ) , not to mention [ this ] ( https://www.noerr.com/de/newsroom/news/klarstellung-der-bundesnetzagentur-zur-regulierung-von-wlan-hotspots.aspx ) and [ that ] ( http://www.telekom-presse.at/smartphones/kontroverse_um_wahlfreiheit_bei_routern_-_avm_kritisiert_bundesnetzagentur.id.24184.htm ) , all left at the mercy of [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/jochen_homann ) asshole , a former `` speechwriter '' for the fdp . 
  need more ? 
  it would be funny if it were not real . 
  gema may still make love to a diseased cactus for all i care.right up there with the bpjm , usk and bundesnetzagentur . 
  please do n't be \u00f6ttinger , please do n't be \u00f6ttinger * reads first line * fuck !, 
   instead , it kept on trying to defend outdated policies or proposed watered-down versions of neoliberalism that barely differentiated it from the center-right . 
  and there is the problem.spd specifically was mentioned , and while i happen to support social democracy i will ** n e v e r ** vote for them again , as they have introduced the new ~ ~ untermenschgesetz ~ ~ povertylaws for the republic , namely the hartz laws.something the tories might be ashamed of . 
  i will vote green or left , perhaps even afd - so long as none of the sons-of-schr\u00f6der remain anywhere near power . 
  seems i have a new movie to watch.fuck you , wannabe-ottoman empire . 
  folks from the states seem confused as to the whole `` reichsb\u00fcrger '' thing.trouble is , these are not your average : `` i 'm just travelling , officer !, 
  i am not driving ! '', 
  kinda nutters.they believe that germany ( as in , the federal republic ) is merely a `` company '' set up by the allies , not a state.variations thereof state that germany ( as in , the reich ) merely signed a ceasefire and thus is still under allied occupation .
