  equating the two seems obvious , but dangerously understates the nature of these lunatics . 
  i like to live in a place where folks may answer polls like this honestly.what stuck out to me is :  unfortunately , the size of the lgbt community has been notoriously difficult to measure . 
  most country censuses do n't ask sexual orientation questions , and the surveys that do attempt to accurately quantify the lgbt population can be stymied by the personal nature of the topic . 
  even when surveys do collect information about lgbt demographics in a certain region or country , it is difficult to compare the results because responses are very sensitive to how the questions are phrased and what answer options are offered . 
  seems logical , but using the ( somewhat ) more varied kinsey scale :  the results show that 5.9 % of europeans identify as lgbt when asked directly , ranging from 7.4 % in germany to 1.5 % in hungary . 
  however , when we give respondents the opportunity to select a sexual orientation somewhere on the kinsey scale , we found that the share of people who identify as not only heterosexual is nearly twice as high ( 10 % ) as the percent who identify as lgbt from the yes/no question ( 5.9 % ) . 
  it seems an accurate number still lies in the ~ ~ closet ~ ~ dark .

  he might be a handsome lad , but i 'd still prefer not to bend over , thank you very much . 
  scedaddle, 
  correct.which is why i am willing to give the benefit of the doubt and assume it does not occur.but to rule out the suspicion is somewhat impossible . 
  difficult to cite a source if aforementioned source can neither confirm nor deny a damn thing ... [ here ] ( http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/cia-economic-spy-misuse-us-intelligence-after-cold-war ) is some light reading on the topic though . 
  my mouth waters thinking of the giant pot of pumpkin soup that thing would give.also , excellent jack ' o lantern , with enough space for a mural . 
  if it 's stupid , but it works , it ai n't stupid . 
  subtle . 
  the author of this ragged excuse for an article may thuck right off . 
  fraudulent elections in russia !, 
  in further news , water found to be wet !, 
  the woman is a flag in the wind on any given topic , but the one thing everyobody wants her to change on is retained with a demeanor stubborn enough to make a mule blush.for what it 's worth , at least she is consistent on a single topic.albeit the wrong one . 
  sweden is mentioned ( if at all ) as merely in `` the same boat '' as us , having taken a large number of migrants ( per capita ) . seen as a sort of experiment , and depending on wether you ask the left or right , either a victory or impending doom . 
  not much to to be gained from our media , these days . 
  i am `` affected '' by alcohol.the `` effect '' of the fireworks is pretty . 
  what else should they be called ? 
  given their political points ( which would only seem sane to a u.s. republican ) the immigration issue ( on which i happen to largely agree with them ) is really the most favourable branding they can hope for . 
  `` family values '' does not fly here.btw , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_for_germany#ideology_and_policies ) are their points in english .

  the difference is ; wifi is seldom lethal . 
  good news , one less . 
  good for renault.i would have enjoyed a zoe myself , were it not for the insanely high price in comparison to other models ( zoe ~ 22k , twingo starting at about 10k ) . 
  very well , let 's leave erdogan out of the picture ( as well as turkey 's domestic policy ) . still leaves incirlik as well as negotiations over the visa-free travel , which thus far have been unproductive to say the least.to press demands and block visitation of soldiers at the same time is contradictory at best . 
   if you take what our government says seriously you are going to have a bad time . 
  makes it a tad difficult to communicate , would it not ? 
  as for the safe zone , the disagreement seems to be over the ypg , as the u.s. see the pkk and ypg as two different parties present , whereas turkey seems to have a rather more . . negative view of them.including the ypg is apparently unacceptable for turkey , yet necessarry in u.s. perspective . 
  regardless , the behaviour regarding the eu ( and it 's members ) is a different issue , recently fueled by stunts such as [ this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-turkey-iduskcn0zh5ov?il=0 ) . meanwhile , delegates get to visit their own troops , as mercifully permitted by turkey.our government had the balls to try and sell [ that ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-turkey-incirlik-iduskcn11e18v ) as a `` victory '' . it 's pathetic and enables right wing populists even more , worsening things further . 
  yet `` much worse '' rarely has such force ( perceived and otherwise ) regarding european safety ( the alleged threat to `` flood '' the place with refugees ) . even if one were to ignore this , repeated insults and stunts such as the blockade of incirlik should not be met with a smile ( or at the very least not a warm one ) . 
  certainly.yet i 'm sure there is a middle point between ideal democracy and an increasingly rabid authoritarian one could press for in turkey . 
  fair point , cutting off co-operation as such would be disastrous.however i fail see the positive impact of effectively affirming the continued autocratic developments by `` improving '' relations.at best , it serves as internal propaganda , at worst it sends a message - one that europe ( not to speak of nato ) will ignore anything so long as bases are kept open . 
  great , further crawling up erdogan 's behind , since he is such a model democrat.they do n't even have the decency to tell us it 's raining when they piss on the public . 
  using a surplus , as opposed to bringing up the cash by cutting everything else .

  this guy is like the german version of farage , in that he is a twat.incompetence and ignorance in one barely intelligible package . 
  i think the government ought to pull its collective head out of its arse and realize the eu consists of more than two nations , specifically when it comes to transnational financial policy.the clear and abhorrent favouritism among the eu towards us is ( imho ) one of the biggest reasons the eu sucks when it comes to fairness and consideration of members.after strangling greece our standing ought to be a quiet and consolidative one , rather than this agressive bs . 
  worst player i can think of regarding this is our [ minister of finance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfgang_sch%c3%a4uble ) and his cursed * schwarze null * , the black zero.to balance the budget ( during an enormously expensive refugee crisis ) is his ultimate goal , come whatever may.this idiot would burn europe to the fucking ground if it gave a financial edge . 
  which in turn is based on the [ system of enormous flood channels ] ( https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1432574/tokyo-discharge-channel.jpg ) in tokyo . 
  the decision has been delayed , my nation may shut right up.further ,  and germany 's eu commissioner , g\u00fcnther oettinger , told the german newspaper bild : `` if the commission wants to preserve its credibility on upholding budget rules , we have to approve sanctions against spain and portugal . 
  `` neither country met the budget commitments that they had both set themselves . 
  if we draw up common rules , those rules have to be adhered to . '', 
  can be ignored.the man is an embarrassment . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9g6txr110c ) is some more of this genius . 
  yo spanish dude : `` nein ! '', 
  i rest my case . 
  yeah , yeah ... great on foreign policy , actually showing up and using her own mouth ( ! ), 
  to utter words.meanwhile all internal matters see only some lackey convey a press statement whilst she cowers out of sight . 
  i refuse to give her credit for stating what half of europe thinks . 
  would be drastic , certainly.but i ca n't imagine most eu members would simply ignore the referendum and accept continued `` special snowflake '' uk.some concessions will have to be made ( token or otherwise ) . 
  it is quite obviously not in breach of art . 
  2 and art . 
  7 was obviously not intended for this situation.but it is one of several ( shady ) ways the eu can take.further , as another user pointed out :  the founding 6 unfortunately have no way to activate article 50 . 
   they have . 
  they can interpret cameron 's statement that the referendum has been held as a formal notification . 
  it would be nasty but apparently they could do that . 
  equally nasty , yet possible.assuming the eu to play nice in the face of this nonsense seems desperate . 
  article 7 . read it . 
  i liked it.apart from the obviously fictional premise , i liked the overall execution.specifically that the russians are not the expected hamfisted villain state , charging in like some horde.instead , russia is shown to prefer the dual approach , seizing oil production while using diplomatic means of `` influence '' and control . 
  but no , ca n't have russia as a villain and an unrealistic plot , because all fiction ( < - ! ), 
  must be realistic , yeah ? 
  oh , a minor squabble over some ~ ~ lebensraum ~ ~ space in the region .

  wish i could disagree , yet history proves you right : /,

  soundeth about right . 
  al-dipshit over here apparently missed the last century.gtfo if you do n't like european social conventions . 
  this reads like satire . 
  i sometimes wonder if mr. davis understands the task he 's been burdened with.judging by his public appearances ( including question time ) he has but a faint idea.it appears as if he need only convince mr. barnier , not the members making up the eu . 
  here is hoping the uk side of things is in good hands , lest it be a very long two years . 
  would a fart be a criminal offence by the same logic ?

  are we done with this yet ? 
  i 'd like the regular non - / r/place forum back . 
  is `` military trainers '' code for `` we 're sending troops but do n't want to say that because it 's unpopular '' ? 
  the phrase pops up suspiciously often these days . 
  sure , why not.what could possibly go wrong with our #neuland government in charge . 
  `` die \u00c4rzte '' put it quite nicely in `` lasse reden '' ( let dem talk ) : angst , hass , titten und der wetterbericht - fear , hate and the weather . 
  saarland sticking to an already popular leader is not all that surprising , imho.i mean , if some csu fossil wins in bavaria , i 'm not surprised either .
