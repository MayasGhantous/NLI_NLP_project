  nigel farage sort of reminds me of feces.no matter what meal they 're in , you ca n't help but have an aftertaste of shit . 
  see , not the whole world is laughing ! ^ bloody ^ baden, 
  erdogan says a lot of things in a day . 
  you 're not missing anything , my spanish is simply insufficient.thanks for clearing up the mistake . 
  seems like the dumbest `` just-a-prank-bro '' the world has seen . 
  jerry can ? 
  what , was he planning to refuel mid-attack ? 
  what a jagged edge on that one - ministry of education , culture and deportation !, 
  ouch . 
  erdo can cry all he wants , the current `` attitude '' is well founded and like to persist . 
  this joker is beginning to remind me of \u00d6ttinger.as in , each time he opens his gob i 'd like to punch him in the former . 
  i am ashamed to admit , for a moment `` satire '' was not my first thought . 
  unfortunately they do occur , though thankfully not as frequent as in yankeeland.winnenden , for example , fits the bill . 
  or the cruel treatment is tacidly accepted because it keeps them out of of western europe , which has seen more than enough . 
  bold strategy cotton !, 
   akira american empire , nuclear war , advanced prosthetics . 
  ghost in the shell happens . 
  the article presumes that trump will actually follow through on his harebrained statements , which i highly doubt when looking at his cabinet.tillerson alone is as pro-trade as it gets , globally.currently exxon ( thus tillerson and consorts ) are eagerly awaiting any loopholes in the sanctions , allowing them to tap into [ russian oil ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/13/exxon-mobil-could-tap-huge-arctic-assets-if-us-russian-relations-thaw.html ) . likewise , trumpy blabbered about `` buying american and hiring american '' , meanwhile his own branded ties are made in china.same goes for the latest pipeline , supposedly made with [ freedom steel ] ( http://www.businessinsider.de/keystone-pipeline-us-steel-trump-2017-3?r=us&amp;ir=t ) . 
  the guy is a constant , unrelenting , pathetic liar.not a single sentence of this clown allows for policy planning.only actual deeds ought to count . 
  excellent . 
  lucky bastard !, 
  for the snow , not the girlfriend ... obviously ... 
  despite inevitable bickering , i welcome the tesla corporation to it 's namesakes continent . 
  good work . 
  sweet green flag , big ol' golden harp inside it.at least that 's what i would presume . 
  old joke : `` why was there never a coup in the u.s. ? 
  because there 's no u.s. 
  visited a buddy in hesse once and watched the `` german '' version while fairly hammered.all i recall is `` jonge ! '', 
  how fitting.the one to use the queen wisest will be victorious !, 
  `` russia outraged by gentle waterfall ! '', 
  `` water found to be wet , kremlin enraged ! '', 
  `` russian officials accuse sack of rice of having fallen over ! '', 
  just russia being russia . 
  scenic . 
  wonder what part of `` common market '' the trumpets do n't seem to grasp . 
  kinda like the trolls of lore in reverse . 
  the furry fanny bag makes it seem quite practical as well . 
  i guess we wo n't be having much in the way of diplomatic talks for a while then.not to worry though , i 'm hopeful cheeto benito will be impeached and thusly remove this funny funyon as well . 
  doesnt get much more festive or famous than venetian carnival , i guess ( i can hear the brazilian disagreement from here ) . 
  dope . 
  thanks for the pronounciation . 
  orange you glad it 's not anymore?i ^ had ^ to, 
  is n't there a knife missing ? 
  i vaguely recall there being some very scottishly named lethal weapon being shoved in the sock . 
  how loaded a location , yet fitting.best of luck . 
  the tiny place with the wooden shoes and funny german pronounciation . 
  well , i mean ... i 'm sure it was a good thing - if you were ~ ~ british ~ ~ english . 
  holy queen isabella ii di spagna batman , that 's a lot of fluff and lace . 
  good point , forgot about the printing press . 
  kant , nietsche are surely of importance ( marx considerably less so , imho ) . cars are also a massive change , agreed.but i still value the idea of public engagement higher than either philosophy or cars ( though i may be somewhat of an oddball in that stance ) . 
  health insurance , general basic education - bismarck and frederick ii , respectively . 
  whats next , `` gentlemen 's agreement '' ? 
  turnabout is fair play , as they say . 
  oh , the month !, 
  right , absolutely.was not imagining soldiers coming down a road , no sir . 
  funny enough , back in 2010 the head of the swiss right demanded a legal framework for adjacent regions to join switzerland by referendum , including baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . never got far from what i heard . 
  the usual sort then ( as far as americans are concerned , i 'm sorry to say ) . back to the pasta tho , do the larger ( and broader ) bands of noodly joy have a name ? 
  so , the big ol' stripes of pasta are the original ? 
  curious , but thanks.also , augustiner and coke , sort of like an american recommending the eiffel tower in las vegas . 
  propably the same reason trump did not win . 
  hubris you say ? 
  huh . 
  between [ w\u00fcrttemberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c3%bcrttemberg ) and [ baden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baden ) , no clue why.except that slogan about the wine , not cool baden !, 
  good . 
  which begs the question , is what yonder we call `` spaghetti '' ( i.e spindly delicious noodly goodness ) indeed the correct term ? 
  kinda like [ hesse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg4frmm6uqc ) while chocking on a overdose of dutch . 
  having embarassed myself upon a former spanish isle , colonized by us and the rosbifs , i shall hold no opinion one way or the other . 
  sure , is lest there be hardcore fucking involved , for the mpaa [ has no power here ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/014/158/youhavnopowerhere-cropped.jpg ) !, 
  lovely . 
  what sort of `` expert panel '' was this , tumblr ? 
  ridiculous . 
  rant all you wish about the treatment , i still prefer this over the barbary of inhumane prison conditions.even for scum like this guy . 
  yeah , yeah ... i 'll believe it when i see it , our #neuland government is unlikely to leave the age of the telegraph anytime soon . 
  `` slams '' < - \u21e9, 
  guy has got to be trolling ( and arguably excellently so ) . 
  you 're right , same elegance.of course `` unsere dame der heiligen dreifaltigkeit '' sounds more like a hospital than a ship . 
  yep , meant that.fella below answered , turns out ye olde ship was high above the waves for a couple reasons . 
  thanks , makes sense.i had assumed something along the lines of structural stability , but that makes a bit more sense . 
  cheers . 
  this might be a dumb question , but on a lot of these olde timey ships the `` chassis '' ( < - term ? ), 
  seems incredibly high , how come ? 
  simply put : no.china has loads wrong with it , no question.the difference is , china meddles scarcely in europe , as opposed to russia.as for `` screw usa ! '', 
  - no.pax americana may be imperfect , but it 's the best we 've got . 
  china has not invaded eastern europe , however . 
  as is tradition . 
  wow , almost forgot this existed.that and medicopter 117 are/were some of the corniest ( yet good ) and rtlest programs i recall.nice to see it enjoyed elsewhere though . 
  while i agree with the macron/schulz goodness , there 's no need for punishment.amicable divorce will do nicely . 
  stupid , uh . . finds a way . 
  i always imagine the sound of a horse clopping somewhere when i see roads like these . 
  man , the decor is something to behold.like a cross between vienna chic and caligula 's mansion . 
  emerald isle indeed.also , wonder what oliver did for the name to be of his folly . 
  excellent . 
  supposedly the president has access to the `` nuclear football '' , a remote authorization device.but such an order by trump would likely be ignored , given the consequences . 
  time to not fucking invest in infrastructure or anything else sensible !, 
  - sch\u00e4uble , propably . 
  10 , `` inland '' . 
  talk about an obvious name . 
  after some hefty reforms , yep . 
  fleischk\u00fcchle - * small meat cake * - best k\u00fcchle . 
  i for one will simply enjoy the show.one thing however : if any yank whatsoever cares to defend the electoral college once more , i shall send a postrider to slap the colonial in the face !,
