  henceforth , if we utilize such olde fashioned institutions , i demand congress to once more assemble its powdered wigs in philadelphia towne hall , as is proper . 
  `` slams '' < - automatic downvote . 
  . . you drive through belgium by accident . 
  ps : not a nazijoke , did drive through nation by accident . 
  always a joy to see the higgins , he somehow always looks jolly . 
  i still recall that tiny but well made bed . 
  biene maya best biene . 
  my brain immediately yelled `` jodokus ! '', 
  the mad twatter never ceased to amaze me with his creativity . 
  she has not tried to harm democracy as such , no.it 's just that after an estimated 157 years of merkel rule , people are finally happy to have an alternative ( no , not * that * alternative ) . 
  one of the most horrific terms associated with her is * alternativlos * - without alternative.so , happy to finally see someone - anyone , really - other than her . 
  so we 're new england ? 
  sweet !, 
  `` germany 's penny-pinching sch\u00e4uble wants to balance budget , eu be damned '' is more like it . 
  it 's not canada that brought about most opposition ( at least hereabouts ) . it was the perception that it would effectively open the backdoor for us companies ( and their fucked up corporate culture ) . 
  along with the whole `` let corporations sue for any old crap '' clause . 
  ohio.corn , and . . uh ... i hear there 's a state fair every politician has to visit . 
  i guess it 's stuttgart . 
  id reckon so as well.if i had to fire offf a guess , i 'd say he appealed to the conservative base - save up , be frugal !, 
  nevermind the cracks in our infrastructure , we 're being fiscally responsible !, 
  merely a guess , but there you go . 
  rightful ~ ~ german ~ ~ french clay looking wonderfull !, 
  given our recent blamage with the airbus a400 , i welcome such news . 
  guy is a cdu fossil , left without competition.within the groko ( grand coalition ) , he was only challenged by peer steinbr\u00fcck who is such an asshat , he is barely worth mentioning ( imagine mitch mcconnell with a german accent ) . 
  unless any ( and i do mean , ** any ** ) figure comes forth to claim the post , sch\u00e4uble will reign supreme.or destroy supreme , relatively . 
  love me some sweet bridges . 
  because he refuses to listen to reason.for example , lately ( roughly the past year ) he has been mouthing off about his damned `` black zero '' ( schwarze null ) , meaning the budget.nevermind that we need desperate improvements in infrastructure or can borrow money on the cheap.it 's the same with greece ( and used to be , to a lesser extent , spain | greece | portugal ) . 
  this thick-skulled dinosaur would rather cut everything to the bone rather than invest a single $ in anything . 
  i 'm a simple person - i see infrastructure , i upvote . 
  our dickhead of a finance minister basically shouted `` pay denbts ! '', 
  again . 
  sch\u00e4uble.again.still.somehow.here 's hoping he 'll be gone sooner , rather than later . 
  `` gone '' as in `` retired '' of course ^ totally . 
  aw :( i recall his talk on overpopulation , was great.clear loss for the world . 
  while i like schulz , he is still the default option.at this point i 'd vote for a cucumber in a dirndl so long as merkel is finally gone . 
  baw\u00fc , southern edge.had a few nights below 0 \u00b0 , sure , but nothing lasting.mostly just wet and unpleasant . 
  seems winter just sort of waved from afar , never really hitting in full force.been a really long autumn though . 
  introibo ad altare spd !, 
  thus the lord help us all . 
  i 've found it weirdly rewarding to simply camp out by my cannons and wait . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/15/creeping-privatisation-nhs-official-data-owen-smith-outsourcing ) . now i wo n't bother hoping for a reasonable discussion , since it 's from the guardian . 
  privatisation by a thousand cuts.you think it 's not the case , i do . 
  scrapping it outright would cause uproar , clearly.privatisation by a thousand cuts is much easier to defend politically.combined with a population willing to tolerate [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38570960 ) , it becomes downright simple.the response by tories is especially callous as the four hour limit for - and i ca n't stress this enough - ** accident and emergency ** itself is idiotic and should be easily reachable.yet not even that is in the budget , so to speak . 
  if you believe this is acceptable , fine.i , however , find it a travesty . 
  concerning 1 ) : by word , not deed.since you do not trust the independent , i suppose [ this ] ( http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2016/10/record-investment-nhs-funding-crisis-stats-behind-theresa-mays-spending-boast/ ) will not be trusted either . 
  for 2 ) : fair enough . 
  except the health secretary [ literally wrote a book ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-privatise-nhs-tories-privatising-private-insurance-market-replacement-direct-democracy-a6865306.html ) on how to replace the nhs with private insurance . 
  thanks for the information , would not have guessed that pointy forts are so `` young '' , by european standards . 
  looks like sort of place i 'm bothered by in total war ( and love in civ 5 ) . anyone got some history on that type of fortification ? 
  `` tits of europe '' , i wholeheartedly approve . 
  now that 's a bitchin ' fortress you got there !, 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  i voted green , though i doubt they 'll ever be part of ( let alone majority party of ) a government , federally.hope dies last , i suppose . 
  marvelous !, 
  perhaps in a century the cdu will pull it 's head out of it 's behind and finally legalize properly . 
  for the kinkiest of exits , well done . 
  refreshing to see a politician praising the national prostitutes , rather than denying having had anything to do with them . 
  h\u00f6cke had some verbal diarrhea again , did he ? 
  well , nothing new here . 
  series is great , russia will yell at anything . 
  `` sack rice falls over in china , kremlin issues enraged statement adressing blatant provokation . '', 
  looking forward to season 2 . 
  well , it 's presumably schulz , [ scholz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olaf_scholz ) and the vile sack of neoliberally seasoned meat that is sigmar gabriel . 
  my clear preference would be scholz , but trusting the spd to listen to its base and select a credible candidate is so 1974 . . 
  fuck this , guy . 
  yet another rightwing prick to bleed any progress and give reacharounds to industry . 
  at the very least those among us with a nihilistic view may seek solace in the image of flames engulfing the trump administration , perhaps accompanied by a lovely soundtrack , as we follow the example set by nero 's legend . 
  first and foremost - let meps introduce legislation to be voted on before the cursed comission ever get its grubby hands on it !, 
  and here i am , overlooking a paultry two cm of snow , longing for a pretty white blanket !, 
  excellent headline . 
  the cbc is quite nice . 
  bloody dutch , being happy and whatnot.they ought to be miserable like proper europeans !, 
  from people in general , sure.from the state , no . 
  source : granny from the former reich fled into future ddr area . 
  i expected `` perkele '' somewhere in there . 
  the f\u00fchrerin says a lot of things these days . 
  agreed , though given history . . well.hoping for the best . 
  anyone on a land border with the northern bit of an island.i doubt people from northern ireland will rush the border , come seperation.further , the good friday agreement relies on the echr , existing independent of the eu as such.therefore i 'd expect some sort of revamped gfa and the common travel area being adjusted accordingly . 
  by now i 'd compare it more to those target knockoffs.decent products , way cheaper . 
  was pessimistic , am relieved.somewhat . 
  i doubt the border ire/nire will be closed.neither side wants the troubles back . 
  earopean unity , spearheaded by sasha grey , lisa ann and amarna miller ( shush , redheads win ) . 
  city of love indeed , keep on enjoying life you persistent parisians !, 
  not in the millions , no . 
  `` slam '' * twitches *, 
  groenlinks.well , then.better start growing my hair and learn die internationale . 
  agenda such as `` do n't tolerate seperatists propped up by russia '' ? 
  seems like a reasonable stance to me . 
  i am slowly beginning to hope for a heart attack , or maybe a stroke.anything that will cause this prick to finally retire . 
  can we tear down the ruin and start again ? 
  seems more efficient at this point . 
  i personally like tesla because it caused our manufacturers to finally give a shit about electric vehicles.tesla could build a giant turd at this point , so long as it finally gets an affordable electric car built by the competition . 
  our glorious fuckwits had the brilliant idea to switch of all nukes without any idea what to replace the baseload electricity with ( while not having the infrastructure for efficient gas ) . therefore , they decided to use [ coal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrvyd3akca ) . 
  in addition to the infamously grabby tsa , destructive searches of baggage , now this ? 
  where exactly does your line of `` reasonable '' end ? 
  now granted , this is optional ( for now ) . still , you seem to tolerate a lot in the name of security . 
  while i agree with this project being dumb , do you know how damned dark alaska is ? 
  edit : due to messy google link , [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/sunshine.png ) is the direct picture link . 
  funny , even my tiny hometown is listed , despite having at most 5000 residents.might have something to do with the reformation monastery next door . . 
  thats just it , she does not have views.the refugees are the political exception , as she usually `` sits it out '' . once a clear preference on any given topic emerges , she will support what seems politically preferrable.even then , she may change her mind ( the idiotic flip-flop with nuclear power comes to mind ) .
