  she will wait until she is opposite all , then turn around and proclaim : `` they 're all standing behind my decision ! '', 
  she is in power because there is no alternative.sch\u00e4uble is touted ( authoritarian prick ) or schulz ( empty page , unknown ) . 
  this dimwit says a lot during a day.little of it is reliable . 
  ran along a path like this in the bavarian national park , with my parents telling me not to leave the wooden bit.obviously , i did - and got freaked the fuck out when the ground underneath my feet started moving !, 
  turns out , i ran on a few cm 's of newly formed ground . 
  never trusted wooded edges after that.nonetheless , upvote . 
  want to negotiate ? 
  article 50 . 
  `` but what about british pen . . '' article 50 !, 
  truth be told , my first impulse was to look for dirt on the author , as - honestly - i called bs on the title alone.dude has solid reasoning though and seems clean.mea culpa , utrecht political nerd . 
  i get a minor stroke everytime i read `` slam '' or `` slammed '' or some crap like that in a headline . 
  having received a 6 in a final zeugnis - still passed.ofc , it 's not worth much now . 
  good !, 
  shit is barbaric and deserves a place on the pyre of history , much like homophobia itself . 
  gon na be a matter of time before it gets tossed out again , due to legal challenges . 
  it was called [ `` the team '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3681610/ ) . 
  [ great !, 
  anyway ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylxcu7e8if0 ), 
  supposedly they 'll finally pull the trigger in march , followed by the two year timescale.so march 2019 might see them gone . 
  can recommend it , rather nice . 
  merely a tenner ?!, 
  what the fuck do you take us for , albania ? 
  for [ santer 's ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/jacques_santer ) sake , at least use a decently high denomination !, 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/ypykylm4oh8?t=34 ) . 
  while not impossible , i would be surprised by them getting enough to become a decent junior partner in a coalition . 
  mostly neoliberal party smeared with a good touch of clientele politics.used to be a viable alternative , went to shit when they tried to lower taxes for hoteliers exclusively.became known as the architect - or hotelier-party . 
  it 's not currently being destroyed by something , so lisbon . 
  thanks for posting , can into subscribed !, 
  our government showing its endless wisdom once more.i still hope for some brave land ( ruled by greens perhaps , hint hint ) to change the definition of `` geringe menge '' ( low amount ) to something absurdly high , thusly making prosecution pointless.but one can only dream . 
  hehehe . 
  i suggest taking them coordinated , half the country at once , single location.take your pick of somewhere in germany or ~ ~ britain ~ ~ england . 
  i remember the fuckery with fallout 3 to this day.did not work on steam back then either , censored garbage.had to know somebody from austria to get a `` proper '' version . 
  sure , but a few details that really ought to be in the core game have been exiled to dlc ( developing provinces , leader personalities , etc. 
  ) . i played core for about two weeks , then grudgingly purchased some dlc . 
  fair warning - game price is acceptable , dlcs will however cost you a fortune . 
  i suppose its a small bump in the road for drugdealers . 
  i 'm ever so slightly weirded out by madam strong & stable \u2122 . one would assume she 'd try and be seen as caring , or at least not actively destructive.yet she has betrayed about the emotional level of windows me , glitching whenever she tries to smile . 
  i am honestly surprised she is still there.sure , tories have somewhat of a charismatic deficit , but someone like hammond ca n't possible be worse . 
  i still think it is utter nonsense.not that i 'd have much use for such large notes , however phasing out to make criminal transactions harder ... wat . 
  i doubt it would yield anything productive , especially when it comes to consumer protection.but why not give it a shot , ca n't do worse than fail . 
  fancy and high-tech looking , i like it . 
  in dutch culture this is known as a `` dick move '' . 
  do it already , close them.force the eu to react , enough with the excuses.get the eu to find a solution once and for all . 
  thanks for explaining.still oddly fancy , especially compared to our somber , boring affair . 
  having witnessed atrocities of fastfood around this continent , my body is ready . 
  wonder how those opera-ish balcony seats came to be.looks elegant though . 
  looks a touch clinical , like a mix between a roman bathhouse , a lawyers furniture and an old operating theatre . 
  that display at the far right of the room does not seem practical at all.nice d\u00e9cor however . 
  looks almost like a repurposed courtroom.cozy . 
  weird that the `` secondary '' place seems much nicer , including the giant flag . 
  my word , fancy does not begin to describe it.lovely . 
  dude looks like the french president in a movie . 
  i took a nap in the bathtub this morning , tried to get at least a few hours of sleep.screw this nonsense , i want ice and snow !, 
  how else is one to summon the ghost of brexit past , if not with a creepy cuppa ? 
  you go ahead and slap a ~ ~ boob ~ ~ chest , you deserve it jezza !, 
  `` slam '' . no !, 
  bad headline !, 
  no treats for you . 
  good . 
  general order of `` no new approved requests for asylum/entry '' , i 'd assume . 
  at least the u.s. have elected congress and senate.besides , the conflict between states and the feds has not ceased to this day and includes a notably violent example of shall we say `` disgruntled '' states.using federal `` force '' is hardly a harmonius action over there.also , we 're not the use just yet . 
  edit : yes , massive hyperbole here.nonetheless , ruling `` from on high '' bugs me . 
  well ... that 'd suck , admittedly.still not enough reason to force people upon nations unwilling to host them.as for the denied people themselves - no clue.got me there . 
  okay , i 'm curious.assuming denied application for asylum/entry , why would deportation of individuals be illegal ? 
  so forcing nations to cooperate shows how willing they are to stand together ? 
  well now.also - why would it be impossible for italy/greece to forcibly deport people , given eu support ? 
  i fail to see why mass deportation from both nations , however unpalatable , are not possible . 
  then the task is surely to saturate only as far as the will goes and deport/keep out the unfortunate overflow ? 
  as for division , i do n't see why visegrad/unwilling nations would care when others accept people ? 
  i do n't advocate we change the entire system ( your example being a horrific thought . . ) but to show reason on this single issue.its a needless division , as dispersing refugees across willing nations with a simultaneous limit of inflow ought to do . 
  well put.seems we agree on all but the pressure upon representatives to take refugees . 
  fair enough , the difference matters.still , unilaterally halting anyone from mena to enter europe sounds like fishing with to broad a net . 
  so , the will of nations is hence to be dismissed ? 
  this is what bothers me about this so much . 
  `` forcing '' these nations effectively places the will of the comission above those of democratically elected leaders , be they right or wrong . 
  `` long and arduos '' indeed , yet not impossible.also , no - i do n't believe ending schengen would even begin to solve the problem.there is no singular solution , as much is clear.but must we really accept people without papers ? 
  i do n't think so.must we pick up migrants in the med , as opposed to funding ( or perhaps rebuilding ) whats left of libya 's coastguard ? 
  there are many small steps that could be taken to reduce the overall strain , it only takes the will to do it.bulgaria and macedonia , for example , have shown fences to be unpalatable - but effective . 
  same goes for expedited deportations , certainly not nice but effective.to adress your point about distinction between actual migrants and refugees , fair enough.but both lampedusa and sicily , kos and lesvos have shown that its not impossible to distinct the groups from one another , even under strained ressources . 
  finally , refugees themselves.however cold this may sound , europe can not take every refugee there is.so , to even begin forcing nations sends a horrible message . 
  in general , [ economic benefits ] ( https://www.oecd.org/migration/oecd%20migration%20policy%20debates%20numero%202.pdf ) are evident.weighing these against the damages to social cohesion is what i 'd like to see . 
  precisely the opposite imho , spread them out as far as circumstance will allow - just within reasonable numbers and not against the expressed will of a nation . 
  equating the horrid acts of such a ( comparatively to 1.7 bn muslims ) tiny minority to the expressed intent of all muslims ( let alone refugees and/or migrants in general ) is somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction , no ? 
  the rights and dignity of those within the democracy , indeed.however to equate those rights to every person that happens to live in a disaster zone of some sort is a touch absurd , imho . 
  when will it get through to the comission that nobody wants these people ? 
  let 's face it , cold hard truth.nobody-wants-these-people . forcing the matter will lead to calamity , as people will begin to care more about the social effects than economical ones ( such as faced from sanctions ) . it 's irrational , sure - but that is the world we live in . 
  keep hammering the issue , watch cracks spread troughout the eu . 
  as a resident of yonder southwest region , i support my taxes ( portion thereof , as it were ) going to the `` poor '' l\u00e4nder.part of our nation , part of its wealth !, 
  the ira ? 
  whats next , raf abducts merkel ? 
  the absurdity . 
  ` s pretty , no argument here . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.businessinsider.de/trump-trade-merkel-germany-eu-2017-4?r=us&amp;ir=t ) is a lovely article detailing the idiocy.i for one would welcome a trade deal with rhode island , just because . 
  cheers to the first ( openly ) gay fella to be called shite | corrupt | arsehole | wankstain | etc. 
  in pubs the republic over . 
  quit bitching , you messed up enough recently.even the best lobbyists have their limit !, 
  chinese beer being the tsingtao stuff ? 
  funny , they 've got it on sale here , `` asian '' week . 
  good point , the party variety would easily prevent such calamity.my bad . 
  i 'd like to quietly point a finger at theresa may as evidence to the contrary.the system may well work , it might also produce a horrible mess being supported by a relatively small number of meps , as opposed to the majority of the populace .
