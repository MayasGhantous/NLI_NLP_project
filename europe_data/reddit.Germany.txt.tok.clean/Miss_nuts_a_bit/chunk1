we could just name everyone ed ( yes , apparently that 's a unisex name ) . 
  or maybe kim . 
  nobody said tumblr ( or sjws for that matter ) were significant . 
  they are n't , but it 's still fun to make fun of them . 
   when have you ever been confronted by these \u00b4 self-centered narcissists ' like that that in real life ? 
  or on any other online forum than tumblr ? 
  when i considered myself a feminist ( i call myself egalitarian now , it 's not like i think feminist causes are n't worth fighting for ) i once read a blog post of a newly pregnant woman who said that if her child was going to be a boy , she would abort him because she does n't have the heart to raise a rapist , as she knows he will be one and he ca n't change his nature as a man . 
  this post was linked to by a pretty big german feminist website which cheered it . 
  i 've also encountered terfs on blogs like this , luckily never in real life . 
  i 'm fully aware that these are exceptions , this is just to counter your argument that you only find these people through sites like tia . 
  that 's just not true . 
  if you buy a movie , look at the back side which languages it features and i guarantee you it works . 
  i hate subbed movies , because if i have to read what they 're saying i ca n't focus on the movie itself and i miss a lot of important things , e.g. 
  facial expressions . 
  i usually do n't have a problem with this , though . 
  it only sucks when the original speaker speaks german and the voiceover is in english , because then i do n't know which voice to listen to ( i try to listen to the german voice then but the voiceover distracts me ) . 
  sometimes they also do this with german dialects , e.g. 
  as a bavarian , that just offends me ( not really ) . 
  well , we do n't * have * to watch the movies dubbed , at least in germany . 
  if you buy a dvd there 's usually the original version on it , too , and if you want to watch a movie in the cinema , the original version usually runs for a few days after release , too ( it is like that with the big blockbusters at least , i do n't know how they handle it with `` smaller '' movies ) . 
  i do n't think they 're really shit , at least if you do n't know the original version . 
  when i watched got for the first time , i watched it in german and i had nothing to complain about . 
  then i watched it in english and then * again * in german , and suddenly it sounded ridiculous . 
  what do people have against gypsies ? 
  edit : downvoting me for asking a question . 
  great , reddit . 
  www.bielefeldverschwoerung.de should be noted . 
  the reasoning is ironclad , so it * has * to be true . 
  you 're just one of them , are n't you ? 
  yup , with the american way people still know you flashed your titties , even if they do n't explicitly show the titties . 
  do n't mind seeing some anonymous breats on a newspaper though . 
  pah , all you filthy ausl\u00e4nders do n't know anything !, 
  all those sites are so beautiful and then germany 's just `` eh '' . 
  well , except for the wadden sea but we share that one . 
  i do n't know why , but i laughed when i read `` flour '' . 
  i guess it just seems so insignificant next to cars and spacecraft . 
  i like the idea , i just do n't think it would work . 
  europe is way too different to be ruled by just one government . 
  we have very rich countries , we have poor countries , we have countries still influenced by communism , etc etc. 
  we ca n't apply the same measures on both sweden and bulgaria , for example . 
  smaller countries ' governments can cut their laws better to fit their demands , that would n't be possible with a federal european state . 
  however , i do agree that we should work toward a unified europe ( as far as possible and while still being individual countries ) , but is n't that what the eu is already doing right now ? 
  i do n't see the need for a federal europe if we can have all the advantages of it without the disadvantages of a central government . 
  number one . 
  yes . 
  for me that 's difficult because i like medieval rock and that scene is kind of big in germany . 
  but i 'll settle for [ saltatio mortis - falsche freunde ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42u45npfe8o ) . 
  there are quite a few . 
  * the netherlands : [ omnia - niiv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjkuak4cprg ) . 
  they do n't sing in dutch , though , mostly in english or celtic ( i guess ? ), 
  languages . 
  * denmark : [ valravn - kelling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w12cqzcc9ji ) . 
  though i do n't know which languages they sing in . 
  this one is in icelandic . 
  * finland : [ korpiklaani - ukon wacka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dvhenaglm4 ) * norway : [ dimmu borgir - sacrilegious scorn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9cqkafnurk ) * france : [ hugo tsr - fen\u00eatre sur rue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhyrzbuzw9g ), 
  your sachertorte is * nothing * against our schwarzw\u00e4lder kirschtorte . 
  in french there 's always an article before the noun . 
  it would be grammatically incorrect to say `` mort aux juifs '' . 
  semmelkn\u00f6del are the shit !, 
  it 's my favourite dish actually . 
  really ? 
  i always just cut them . 
  i do n't think i could even pull semmelkn\u00f6del apart , they 're way too firm . 
  kn\u00f6del , you mean, 
  i 've never eaten sauerbraten in my whole life . 
  but you 're on point with the kn\u00f6del and red cabbage . 
  maybe schnitzel would be a better one ? 
  damn , i just thought about making this two days ago ... could have had all that sweet karma for myself . 
   environmental friendly so long as nothing goes wrong , at least . 
  plitvice is so amazing !, 
  i definitely need to go there again ( and to all the other places you 've listed ) . 
  well ... now i 'm mad that i went to split on my vacation and not dubrovnik . 
  we have so many beautiful castles . 
  schloss neuschwanstein is just meh . 
  i always thought our police cars were green ... am i stupid ? 
  probably . 
  that reminds me of my own childhood . 
  i live in germany/bavaria and in my area we pronounce m\u00fcnchen `` meecha '' . 
  it took too long to understand those were actually the same city . 
  `` waiting for the bus of europe '' ? 
  i 'd actually want to see that . 
  i 'm interested in the different bus-waiting habits of different countries . 
  if you click on the thumbs up button , the number next to it is +1 ( also the thumb and number become blue ) . 
  if you click on the thumbs down button , nothing happens at all . 
  on a serious note , there are * so * many let 's players out there that you 'd have to be really entertaining to draw the attention to your videos ( or you are already known for another type of videos ) by now . 
  the eurovision song contest is mostly about performance . 
  the music is still kind of important of course , but it 's mostly about how well-liked a performer is for the viewers , or how much they liked the show they put on . 
  just look at lordi , lena meyer-landrut or nicole ( 1982 ) who made a political statement . 
  the performance of conchita wurst is a political statemet , too , she 's also very likable and compared to the other performances , she just stood out . 
  i do n't understand why people are so upset because she won , or say how she only won because she has a beard . 
  yeah , of * course * that was a huge factor but it has always been like that , it 's not a new phenomenon . 
  if you see 26 people singing the same run-of-the-mill pop songs , you will be thankful for everyone who stands out and is different , and of course those people are going to win . 
  [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/flag_of_the_soviet_union.svg ) . 
  yeah , or [ that one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/reichsadler_der_deutsches_reich_%281933%e2%80%931945%29.svg ) . 
  i have never seen the combination eagle + thunderbolts ( ? ), 
  and `` gott mit uns '' above . 
  were n't the nazis against church anyway ? 
  that 's what i meant . 
  there are people who have a full-time job but still get unemployment benefits because they do n't earn enough themselves . 
  temporary employment and mini jobs push the unemployment rates down , too .
