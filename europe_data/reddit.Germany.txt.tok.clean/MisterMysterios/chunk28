  it was ruled that , when someone sleeps , they are always in a state that you can them only kill them in a deviouse way . 
  than came the case of the domestic tyrant who was violent towards his wife and at one point , he hit his child half-dead . 
  he threatened that , when he ever sees the boy again , he will kill him , and the mother believed him . 
  when the man was asleep the wife killed the man , making her legally a murderer . 
  but due to that situation , the court decided to change the definition of deviouse means in oder to spare her a lifelong sentence . 
  that is what the case is for , looking at the law and applying it for the specific case . 
  and the state leaves these holes open for the court in order that they can apply the law to the specific case sufficiently . 
  german law-student here : what the fuck are you talking about ? 
   rulings and legislations are usually in favor of the governments legislation yes , but to limit the legislation in favor of the state , we have the echr , the eu-treaty and our sovereign nation 's constitutions which state all limits to how the state ( or the eu ) can empower themselves . 
  if you would have any real clue what you are talking about , meaning that you already read dozens and hundrets of cases , follow legal discussions that are often based on rulings , than you would know that the statement  rulings ... are usually in favor of governments is absolut not true . 
  in case of the ecj , it as actually pretty furstrating which things they rule against the states in their attempt to follow the effet util instead of proper human thinking . 
  well , yes and no . 
  yes , the tax-measures are open for the states to decide on their own , they just ca n't use taxes to give hidden subsidies . 
  the allocation of subsidies is something the eu can rule about since it is a competition-law-problem . 
  if one state gives specific aid for one of their companies , they can basically destroy the rest of the european competition . 
  take vw for example ( which was fined 120 million in 2003 under the a similar premise ) . 
  when they get illegal aid , they can produce cheaper and thereby damage for example the french car manufacturer by selling cheaper cars . 
  ouside of a single market , the french could esily either help their own constructor with even less taxes or just could restrict the import of vw . 
  within a single market , the second option is not possible , and the first one would create a race that would finally damage all parties envolved . 
  therefor it was decided that every nation has to follow certain rules when they give out subsidies . 
  what irland did with their tax-agreement with apple was that they basically gave them an even better tax than the 12,5 % that is for every irish company the obligatory tax . 
  this was seen as hidden subsidy . 
  that is what they are saying in every single comment on that thing , they just do n't go into detail what these taxes mean , and that 0,005 % taxes is against competition-law is pretty obviouse . 
  than these eu-nations will just make a subsidiary in a nation that already has a investment-treaty with the us and than these actions will be a breach as long as only eu-nations are taxed hire . 
  that would be a major cut in their own flesh by the us . 
  actually , orban called her ( and austria ) saying that the refugees just borke out of his border and now marching towards germany and he asked them to take them in . 
  because of that , merkel went in front of the cameras and said that she would take these , i think that were already at least hundret thousand , but do n't pinpoint me on that because i am not sure , in , but the statement was first only about these that were already broken through hungary . 
  but due to the usual shortanage of her statements so that it is a better tagline for newspaper , she suddenly invitet the world , and than came several bots and others that had interests in missinterpreting her more and suddenly all of the world felt invited . 
  than maybe it is the right of the ecj ? 
  the european court of justice repeatetly ruled that dublin is not applicable if there are doubts that the state that should process the asylum-application can do this while honoring the human rights . 
  here is one example : http://www.sharesproject.nl/news/ecj-judgment-on-dublin-ii/ how many court-decisions do you want me to copy and paste ? 
  that was what i meant  . 
  it needs a court-decision . 
  and with that the man knew she was cheating i meant to that extent that he is sure that the kid is n't his . 
  for example when he was on a working tour during the time of conception . 
  no problem . 
  and if i may add a little extra to this that i just thought about . 
  it has a reason why a dna-test ca n't lead automatically of the recoval of the fatherhood . 
  there are two examples where a not-biological-father should have to stay for his status : when there was a sperm-donor and when the father knew it was a baby from another man and accepted fatherhood nontheless . 
  i think sperm-donor are self explaniatory . 
  in the other case , imagine a man starts dating a pregnant woman ( what she tells him from the beginning ) . 
  when the child is about to be born , the father want to start a family with them and accepts therefor the fatherhood of the child . 
  why should he have than the right afterwards to just go by saying `` not biological , see the dna ! '' . 
  same with a husband that knew that his wife was cheating , knew he could n't be the father due to his sterility or similar reasons , and nontheless , to save his marriage , accepts the child as his own . 
  by willingly accepting the child , he lost his right to just easily back out . 
  to prevent these fathers from just backing out , it was put upon courts to decide about the status as father . 
   the commission 's move is unprecedented yeah - it was never heard before that the eu demanded money back that was granted by national law - or maybe not , ask vw who had to pay back billions of subsidies back in i think it was 2013, 
  it is mixed . 
  if you are religiouse , you see is at a religiouse concept , even when you have to go to the register office , the more important part is to go to the church . 
  for others , they just see it as a promise to the other to stay together without the religiouse context . 
  everyone can see it as they want , the thing is , the legal concept of marrige is completly secular and it gives everyone the freedom to think into it whatever they want . 
  yes , it would . 
  and since the father can ask the court these days without any reason , just a normal doubt , the fahter is sufficient protected . 
  no , you are not forced since you can ask the court to revoke the status as father , and with that you do n't have to pay anything anymore . 
  no , it is applying the law . 
  you ca n't act like germany would ignore the ecmr when germany just applies the right of consideration the ecmr provides in order to balance the rights of different parties . 
  germany has seperated marriage from religion . 
  a marriage is only legally binding when it was closed in front of the register office . 
  a marriage in front of the church has no legal meaning , it is only a tradition that is normally done after the offical marriage . 
  if you have doubts , you can go to the court , say `` i have doubts ! '', 
  and they will order the test and than you will be freed from your status as father . 
  the only thing is that the dna is one of the most private things of a person and that even a baby has their own rights of privacy that can only be lifted by the legal guardians or a court . 
  the mother , the baby and the father , depending on who does not want it . 
  for the baby to accept this infringment of its rights , it needs either the agreement of the legal guardians or a court . 
  such a test is an infringment of the private rights of the baby that can only be done when both legal guardians ( meaning either both parents or if no father determined only the mother !! ) . 
  at least that was the ruling of the constitutional court . 
  civil union only between gays as a replacement of marriage ( and than they have the same rights in regard of taxes and heritage ) , but no , nothing else for straights . 
  all these benefits are only applicable if you are married . 
  there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right ** except ** such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well-being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the ** rights and freedoms of others ** . 
  even if there is a right of private or family life , but that is not an ultimative right but can be limited if there is a good reason for it , one of these is the rights and freedoms of others . 
  when a man payed for a spouse that is n't his , his own rights and freedoms were quite infringed and he has the right to demand to know who the father is in order to demand the child-support back from this guy . 
  well , in germany , marriage has still a lot of benefits . 
  for example it can have a lot of taxatin-benefits , and in special when we start to talk about inhereting , you might be fucked when you are not married to the person that just died since you have to pay a mean death tax when you are neither child , husband / wife or parent of the deseased . 
  the problem is that every father is obliged to pay for his child . 
  if he learns that his child is not his own , he payed probably for years for someone else 's kids . 
  the father ca n't get the money back from the mother ( due to legal reasons , the money was used for the child and if the money has to be given back , the child probably has to suffer as well ) . 
  due to the current law , the alleged father has only a right to get money from the biological father , but for that , he has to know who he is . 
  in which way does this scrap the echr ? 
  ehm , that is not how it works in germany . 
  you are officially in the documents in one of three cases : * you are married to the mother at the moment of birth . 
  * you accept the child as your own in your free will * a court decides that the father is actually the father ( which would need probably a dna-test ) . 
  so , in every form where a dna-test is not part of the procedure , it is , due to the circumstances , rather normal that the man does it expecting to be the father . 
  this complete law only applies when the father get doubts afterwards , when he already payed in the believe to be really the father . 
  a documentary about systematic abuse on disabled children in romania prior to 1990 and how it was doubted that the neglact was purposly to let them die . 
  also , how the kids that still lived there at the time of the fall of the iron curtain were helped to become normal kids again . 
  every father has to pay child support . 
  also , you only become legally the father if you are either married with the woman at the time of birth or accept the child as your own . 
  from the second on the father is in the papers , he has to pay , meaning that in every single case of a married couple , the father is legally obliged to pay . 
  and it is actually only limited to cases where the father contested it . 
  the father contest it by going to court and demand the dna-test and they will order it . 
  yes , because doing an dna-test in any kind without consent or court-decision is a violation of the private spehere of every person . 
  you mean with every single birth we do a dna-test ? 
  even when there is no single indication that anything happend ? 
  that is kinda exessive . 
  i heard that he demands of merkel and gabriel to distance themselves from the decision of the parliament . 
  i really get the chills when i see something like that . 
  i have to think that most likly , if i would have been born to such a place , i would have ended probably in such a place as well . 
  bodily disabled ( well - you wo n't see it when you meet me on the streets due to the wonder of modern medicin , maybe just some limping ) , a younger brother of a sister that has similar body disablities in addition to autism . 
  also , problems with speaking as a little kid , treatment in specific kindergardens . 
  i would have been defenitly seen as unhealable .
