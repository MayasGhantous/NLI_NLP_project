  and i do n't know of a statistic that also counts the immigration backgrounds when the people actually gained german citicenship ( which is a rather difficult procedure ), 
  depends on their nationality . 
  since 2000 there is a possibility for kids born in germany to two foreing parents with permanent residence who lived , at the time of birth , more than 8 years in germany to hold both nationalities , the german one and the foreign one . 
  before that , the kids had to decide between the 18th and 23rd birthday what passport they want . 
  if they are officially germans , than they are counted as germans . 
  if gabriel becomes the frontrunner of the spd during the elections , i do n't know what might happen to the spd, 
  turkish 2 . 
  romanian 3 . 
  polish 4 . 
  italian 6 . 
  bulgarian 7 . 
  albanian 10 . 
  greek 15 . 
  bosnian pakistanian is not even in the 25 most accused nationalities . 
  do you really mean they bleach the faces ? 
  i think he referrs not only to general blurring of faces , but that they make it look like the bleached face is whiter than it was originally to hide foreign ancestry or foreign nationality . 
  and that , i never heard from . 
  that german friend of a friend seems to be member of the new-right . 
  the faces are generally blurred in germany ( with the few exeptions of famouse people of people of public interest ) , but normally , the first name is given or in some newspaper the origion of the person . 
  so , if it was a foreigner or a nationalized descendent of immigrants , it is regularly known . 
  you mean the crazy gambling that caused basically every single finance-bubble we had in the history of stock-exchange ? 
  well , it has its pro if these high-risk stuff is concentrated to one place . 
  there is a crime-suspect statistic that is not sorted by race , but by nationality . 
  to be more precise , there are two statistics , the one that is always cited and the relevant one . 
  the always cited is the one that included alien-crime , meaning illegal border-crossing that every single refugee is guilty of ( because that is the way they came in ) . 
  because of that , this statistic is worth basically nothing , and of couse syrians are leading this statistic . 
  if you look at the relevant one , the most foreign suspects are turkish , after that we have most of the eastern-european nationalities , and only at place 8 i think are syrians , with a per capita-criminality similar to germans . 
  and the reason why people do n't care as much ( at least in the areas where they are in contact with actuall refugees / immigrants ) is that they are not that bad as it is portraied and that the assholes that did something like new years eve are the exeption . 
  only the already rather right-wing people that regularly life in areas with hardly any refugees are the loudest one crying to close the borders . 
  but if gabriel runs , everything is open , even that the greens surpass the spd . 
  depending on what sunday-question you look at , cdu+spd are between 53-57 % . 
  even counting the others with 4-5 % does not give them that much of a fail-margin if they want to govern alone ( well , i doubt that any of them want to govern together again , but it is still the best alternative ), 
  the finance system is only global as long as the nations give the bank free passporting-rights . 
  if not , finances can become rather fastly national organized . 
  the trick in the last decades was that the right to do finance was given out more freely , but only as long as the different banks have a local subsidiary sitting in the different places . 
  only because of that , there are so many banks in the uk , because these banks have a subsidiary in the eu . 
  if the banks want to continue to do their banking in the eu , they have to resettle to the eu . 
  also , i am pretty sure that a hell lot of bank-freedoms are based on treaties the uk is part of due to the eu and the uk would have to get into these on their own again , all of that makes the uk as an international finance center rather unattractive . 
  ttip is rather out of question since europe is not interested to have ttip with a trump-run government . 
  the question at the moment is about tpp ( which does not include europe by th eway , but is a agreement between the us and several asian countries ) which creates a lot of influence for the us in that region while minimizing the power of china . 
   not gon na happen . 
  says the man that has knowledge about the german election-system , how it is concipated to prevent such extremists from gaining power ( in contrast of any binary fptp-system , which enabled both , trump and brexit ) , that knows the german public media landscape that is not reliand on scandals ( in contrast to murdock and basically every us-news-channel ) and the german political landscape . 
  ca n't tell much about tpp , and also not about ttip because there were never anything more than concept papers that leaked out ( which tell not really more of the content of the end-treaty than the toilet paper of the negotiators since they contain regularly every part that the negotiators left in to be haggled down from these in order to ensure other provisions . 
  the ` leaked ' texts of ceta have nothing to do with the end-text ) , but for ceta , the investment-law part actually exempts all public-health-laws from the right of the companies to go in front of an investment-court . 
  not gon na happen . 
  all signs stand for a next government of her . 
  if she will be able to do it with the spd alone is the only question , or if she has to let the greens in the government as well . 
  nontheless , the costs for insurances are way lower here than the us . 
  us is known to be one of the most costly and inefficient health-systems in the modern western world ( and one of the unfairest as well ), 
  i was writing more about ttip and ceta since i have more knowledge in these fields ( german law student who took classes in international investment law . ), 
  because this will increase the wages in asia , making it less attracktive to outsource . 
  agreed , the minimum wage will be still wide under the western world , but that might have been the necessary starting point . 
  you mean that a system that woudl require asian nations to introduce a minimum wage , introduce mandatory nature-and-wildlife protection so that the asian nations 's ca n't simply gain profit by destroying their environment ? 
  yes , the bad bad globalists . 
  regularly due to union fighting among each other . 
  cockpit is one of the most disgusting single-purpose unions ( only for pilots ) that destroy the complete purpose of a union : that all members of a company fight for everyone 's benefit . 
  but now , single core-jobs started to get their own unions , than do strikes that disrupt everything , and fight for higher wages at the cost of the jobs that ca n't afford to strike . 
  ( same with hospital-staff . 
  whenever the physicians strike , the wages of the cleaning-staff gets cut down so that a lot of hospitals fails here at the moment to sustain basic hygenic necessaties . 
  source : family owns a company that do a lot of cleaning ) . 
  i agree with that . 
  but saying that the arab countries have only terrible healthcare or no welfare-state is wrong , since they have them . 
  they are build on slavery ( as i said in my post as well ) , but it does n't change that these systems exists also in this area . 
   `` attempts at physical intimidation '' ehm , this law already exists , it is called `` n\u00f6tigung '' ( coercion ) , but for that , you need a n\u00f6tigungserfolg ( success in coercion ) or at least the aim to get so for an attempt . 
  but you have to use either force or the threat of force ( standing in the way so that the other ca n't get passed you can alone constitute force though ) , and it seems that it was not applicable here . 
  we ca n't just imprison everyone who is talking shit . 
   but they were dressing in something that looked like an uniform and pretended to enforce laws . 
  it is only allowed for police , but the ruling was that these clothes were so far off from any police clothes that nobody would have thought that they were actually police . 
  and their `` enforcement of law '' was trying to talk people into the islmic religion , something that i completly disagree with , but what is not punishable by law . 
  depends where you look at . 
  saudi arabia has a hell lot of factual slaves , but as soon as you are a citicen of that nation , then you have the best wellfare state possible , same in quatar . 
  so , even when the notion is not that wrong that welfare-states are especially big in europe , it does not mean that we are the only one that have it . 
  in criminal law : only in context of sexual stuff ( having sex in public for example ) . 
  everything else is at most a petty offence . 
  if it can be prooven beyond a reasonable doubt that he did that , he will be accused of incitment of hatred , as it happend with several islamic preachers in the past . 
  but first : it is quite difficult to proove what happens beyond closed doors within the islamistic groups , because of this , it took quite a long hidden investigation against a salafist organization until they were raided last week and their organization was dismantled . 
  so , if they have enough evidence against this preacher , than they will come after him using the full power of law . 
  and second : the sharia-police was not a group that was ( openly ) spread inciting hatred , for that , they would have to start calling for the sinfullness of all westerners , how they have to be slaughtered - etc. 
  and that was not what happend . 
  the greens have to different streams inside them , a very left leaning that is normally rather strong , so that they , when they go into coalition with the spd , fit rather well . 
  but the other stream is the more conservative part of the greens that would fit to the cdu . 
  if there is a coalition with the cdu , it would mean that the conservative part of the greens are taking over the lead in the party . 
   worst politican in entire germany ** cough ** cough ** beatrix von storch ** cough ** but agreed , if you does n't count any afd - `` politician '' , wagenknecht is rather high on the list . 
  the cdu is not right wing , they are center right and drifted in the last decades even more to center as they were before . 
  the cdu has parts that are more right though , in special in the bavarian sister csu , but they are not dominating the party at all . 
  dam , yeah , mixed up the two forms of the o-declination :d . 
  there was a reason why i nearly failed latin . 
  nobody speaks about punishing the uk , the thing is that we want to honor the lisabon treaty since there is no way to change it in the current political landscape . 
  that is something that goes along with a state of law and honoring legal obligations , something that the current uk government seams to miss . 
  and also , the uk does not want to be part anymore , they are giving out one red line after antoher . 
  why is it the position of europe to give in just because the uk has set a red line ? 
  as much as the uk starts with their own red lines , the eu will have to do the same , and the ultimative red lines are set forth in the lisabon treaty , and in comparison to the uk where their red lines are political ones ( which means weak and changable at the blink of an eye ) , the eu-red lines are constitutional ones , meaning it needs a change of treaties all memberstates have to agree upon , several with their own referendum ( so , basically impossible to change ) . 
  at the moment , uk is the kid that always runs with the head against the wall in the firm believe that the wall will breakt before their head . 
  the fact is that , what the uk wants , is legally impossible . 
  the single market access is bound to the four freedoms , that is the current legal framework by the lisabon treaty , and any change of that would need an agreement of all eu nations , several would have to do referendi to change the framework treaties of the eu . 
  several nations that profit from freedom of movement , meaning every east european nation , would block this at once . 
  and , even worse , when we start to change the eu-treaties because one nation demands it like that , we will have this than over and over again since why should n't germany not get the same as the uk ? 
  or netherland , or france ? 
  the lisabon treaty stands , and so the position of the eu . 
  if the uk likes it or not , that is the situation they have to deal with .
