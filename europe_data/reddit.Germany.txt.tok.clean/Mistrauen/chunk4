  so it is n't our fault that the englishmen invented such a dump language, 
  for real : germany : why are german . . * . . s so unfriendly * . . s so ugly * . . s so racist * . . movies so bad, 
  but how do they charge you ? 
  i doubt , that reddit would give them your datas . 
  would n't he need your identety , in order to sue you ? 
  german seaarches on dutch : warum sind die niederl\u00e4nder  not in the em  so big  orange  slim, 
  i get : why are the brits . .  so stupid  leaving the eu  so good in olympia  ( again leaving the eu , just with a different wording ), 
  they were the only countrys to give us points in eurovision , so i guess yes . 
  you remember the demonstrations of german-russians in whole germany after rt reported a rape of a german-russian girl by a refugee , that turned out to be a blant lie and completly faked ? 
  solar could work , even if it would n't be to efficient . 
  travel from a less polluted region in europe to a more polluted region and breath the air ? 
  a bus driver in poland heard my german accent and bad polish ( it was enough to communicate thought ) and changed to germna , the problem was that this guy just new some words from his german classes some years ago and just shouted random german words at me . 
  for gods sack , ca n't we have one tread about germany , were nobody mentions refugees ? 
  that are mostly racist people , who do n't want to be called racist . 
  people like you are disguesting , the only think , this will cause is a ethnical mini-war between different parts of the country . 
  is n't the concept kinda racist ? 
  so hitler was n't racist to poles and other slavs , tho he thought of them as a different race ? 
  just shoot them all . 
  they are just brown sand people , who cares about them anyway . 
  not going to happen anyway , just a minister , who tries some populism . 
   it 's especially sad for the government of meck-pom . 
  they 're doing a good job and the voters did n't really want them to change . 
  polls show that the majority of afd voters were placing their vote because of the refugee politics of the german government , something that was n't even remotely voted on this weekend . 
  votes are being obscured , because people do n't realize the responsibility of voting . 
  completly agree . 
  the problem is that most afd voters are first voters . 
  as they did n't vote prior i guess , that these voters were n't politically interestet prior the refugee crises and only care about this on theme and do n't even look at real regional problems or how afd acted in other regional parlaments . 
  4 pillars of bavaria : csu , bmw , fcbayern and reinheitsgebot, 
  i just do n't think that you made a good argument , that 's all . 
  and hungary + greece were n't overflooded with refugees before germany said to let in hungarys refugees ? 
  you are in a tennis club , were everybody pays a little fee , which is used to pay tennis balls and the renovation of the tennis ground . 
  but one day all te members do n't want to pay the fee anymore . 
  they still want the tennis balls and a intact ground to play , but the fee is just annoying and they would rather buy some new tennis cloths with the money or go out for a beer . 
  so what are you doing , if you are supposed to manage the club ? 
  would you just let it go , bc everybody wants it ? 
   i would that sports injuries could be a problem if we were suffering from some sort of epidemic of them . 
  you 've probably never been to a hospital near a ski resort . 
  bs german gouvernment recognized the genozid and than said , that say would pay reperations with development aid , which namibia did n't agree with , cause they wanted monentary compensations . 
  and what 's with the pretty recent recognition of the herero genozid ? 
   may be would try to get terrorists alive for purpose of later tortures . 
  the afd in mv does n't seem to be apealed of the npd and let 's be honest some politican in the afd ( especially a big junk of them , who 've been npd-member/polticans before joining afd \u00e1re just plain racists and neo-nazis . 
  let 's not forget h\u00f6cke ( a major politican in the afd ) and his neo-nazi-like [ race theories ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/neue-rechte-hoeckes-rassentheorie-13975575.html ), 
  and i disagree . 
  i guess they will import beer , at least the next asylum seeker shelter , which is full of syrian and afghan teenagers getting drunk on beer and smoking weed makes me think so . 
  really france ? 
  you are the one talking ?

  ok fellow germans , if we do this right , we could have our own little german middle eastern country in a few years and from there civilize and germanize the whole middle east . 
  think of all the possibilitys !, 
  the text is also written in law english and they are n't alowed to bring a lawer or translator into the rooms . 
  bavaria is germanys tax haven afair, 
  than why even care ? 
  imo \u00d6defrit rolls better of the tounge . 
  yipp , afd calls it pinocchio-presse, 
  do n't break the circlejerk !, 
  did you just call the glorious , culturally rich and important niederbayern ... unterbayern ? 
  you should be fed to a bunch of lions and [ heraldic panthers ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/panther_ ( wappentier ) ) and your bones should be burned and thrown into the bavarian forest as a sacrifice to the glorious bavaria . 
  probably 6 bavarians , who once voted die linke, 
  there are aspects increasing the birth rate in a country and such decreasing it . 
  aspects decreasing it are : * education * birth control * job opportunities * financial opportunities * outlawed child marriage aspect increasing it : * medicin, 
  i will think of you as a bigot , but i would n't stop you . 
  i am actually ok with people not serving a specific nationality , etc. , if they are honest about it and write it big on the frontdoor and deal with the consequences aka less costumers . 
  we already have a old charismatic communist politican , why should we get a second one ? 
  of course . 
  finland or sweden . 
  i love snow and adore norse myths . 
  finland or sweden . 
  i love snow and adore norse myths . 
   breitbart i ca n't take a man with this name serious . 
  he sounds like some pirate captain . 
  from time to time i see female groups of arab tourists wearing it in munich . 
  they are used a lot for foreign food or mixes and stuff like that , but the dishes i mentioned were created years ago and are pretty good . 
  i mean you do n't need spices and stuff like that to make food enjoyable . 
  it 's a bit colder up here and greenhouses are a pretty new invention . 
  you should be able to speak some basic german or look for a job in a more tourist, 
  interesting , in niederbayern [ this ] ( http://www.almliebe.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/outfit_image/340x509/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/img_3344_2.jpg ) kind of dirndl gets more popular with the time . 
  antifa is short for antifacist and is a term for everybody fighting against facism , for example with adds , yes , some antifas also use violence , but not all . 
  of course some antifas are also anarchist , but it is n't mandatory . 
  and reichsb\u00fcrger are n't anarchists , they often have their own little gouvernment driving licenses , passports and stuff like that . 
  where are you from ? 
  you do n't seem to be german . 
  if we go for non-southern but european food : [ pierogi ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eywhbg5a4uy/maxresdefault.jpg ) , waffels , potato salad , [ kn\u00f6del ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/semmelkn%c3%b6del.jpg ) , [ sp\u00e4tzle ] ( http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/spaetzle-15a077a5b1c68146c9e98c245bd4c076_fjt2011110161.jpg ) , a lot different kinds of sausage , bread , beer and cheese , pretzel , grilled chicken , [ steckerlfisch ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/steckerlfisch#/media/file:steckerlfisch-1.jpg ) , [ stockbread ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockbrot#/media/file:kn%c3%bcppelbrot_4.jpg ) , spanferkel , [ radi ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/radi.jpg ) , etc. 
  i 'm sure some fellow europeans want to add some dishes . 
  because of our `` culture '' . 
  i think it is a bullshit law and hope for a ffk movement to rise up against it . 
  they decided to ban eu-immigration , but the gouvernment wants to stay in the common market ... 
  easy solutions for complex issues = populism,

  i 've been on a beach wearing jeans and a hoody that covered my hair . 
  it 's a wonder , that i did n't have bomb some tourists . 
  bachelorette party ? 
  \u00b4 burkinis are also worn by woman , who normally wear headscarves . 
  just look at one , it does n't even cover your face . 
  sun allergy ? 
  also they are less integrated , if they ca n't take part in social life , bc of their cultural believes and get isolated . 
  wait , you are allowed to show your nippels on beaches but not in tv ? 
  baltics do n't exist . 
  sure just give russia poland a nation integrated in the common market , it wo n't affect the economy at all . 
  bs argument . 
  that would n't happen , especially bc countrys east of poland would n't want to be next and west of poland do n't want their economy destroyed .
