  slippery slope argument = fallacy . 
  well , these threads are not exactly full of professional lawyers and judges with the neccessary expertise in regard to the law . 
  instead it 's mostly idiots shouting stuff they heard or read somewhere at some point . 
  xenophobia , hatred , arrogance and all other kinds of emotions do n't really give room for a serious debate , though . 
  for example art . 
  17 of dublin-iii explicitly allowed germany to voluntarily take the responsibility for the refugee proceedings . 
  does anyone care about that ? 
  no ... why care about facts when you can hate on evil eu or muslims or germans or greeks or whatever one needs to feel oneself better . 
  so are you . 
  a country that has this kind of attitude contradicting the very human rights they swore to accept by joining the eu might not be so beautiful , after all . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  learn the difference . 
  yeah right ... what a load of rubbish . 
  `` for maintaining its discriminations '' . 
  ftfy, 
  you really do n't know what you 're talking about , do you ? 
  every person in germany is able to sue for his rights . 
  if he has n't got the funds , he can apply for `` prozesskostenhilfe '' according to \u00a7 \u00a7 114 ff . 
  this even applies to eu-citizens living in germany . 
  consequently it 's the state paying for the proceedings not the individual if he has n't got the means . 
  more like `` alternative facts '' ... 
  and that in itself is completely fine as long as you are able to sue for readmitting your post/comment in court . 
  if the police mistreats you , it 's the same principle . 
  and as it stands this very right deriving from art . 
  19 iv gg is sufficiently provided within the netzdg . 
  if you 're too lazy to go to court that 's your problem . 
  in germany this burden lies with the citizen . 
  this law is for enforcing already existing law such \u00a7 \u00a7 130 , 185 , 186 , 187 stgb in social media . 
  how about you read up on the circumstances before crying wolf ? 
  trump 's victory was well within expectations if you consider the regular threshold of error . 
  afd is literally a completely different thing, 
  this is literally not true under german law , at all . 
  because \u00a7 \u00a7 185 , 186 , 187 stgb literally oblige the government to step in and deal with the relevant posts/comments . 
  do explain the term `` elites '' please . 
  who would that be in your opinion ? 
  what about those that have a genuine claim to asylum ? 
  no , it 's simply against constitutional law . 
  did n't know that gael had his own language developed ... ... . . ( / s ), 
  nope . 
  by doing that you throw basic human rights over board as well as constitutional rights . 
  but yeah , u/angiemcd knows law and rights better than courts , right ? 
  you 're being the minority here . 
  threads like these are literally filled up with extreme right-wingers . 
  yeah right . 
  you should see a doctor about your perception of reality . 
  cause it seems fucked if you honestly think of western europe as a `` third world shithole '', 
  that phrase has been identified as a neo-nazi phrase by various german courts . 
  just saying ... 
  to the radical right-wing brigade it seems to be . 
  so what ? 
  if you judge opinions by karma score , you are beyond help anyway . 
  source ? 
  what makes you think that ? 
  says who ? 
  should have put an / s after his statement then . 
  why do people always forget that reading irony into mere writing can be damn near impossible . 
  i did n't divert shit . 
  he described a subreddit with certain characteristics . 
  and i pointed out that there are very clear parallels to another subreddit and the way it treats differing opinions . 
  what 's your problem ? 
  the wave of refugees was already on its way when merkel gave her press conference . 
  edit : once again reddit proves very resiliant to facts . 
  should n't be surprising . 
  the pope might , but the codex iuris canonici definitely does n't . 
  sure ... and how exactly do you want to abolish a religion that about a billion people in dozens of different countries all over the globe follow ? 
  look at what reactionary religious conservatism is pulling off in poland , right now . 
  you mean like r/catholicism ? 
  wow such expert , tell me , how long you professionally studied this subject ... / s, 
  this right here . 
    contraception was specifically invented to allow people to satisfy their sexual desires without having to have offsprings . 
    again , the cons of contraception outweigh the pros . 
  prior to contraception becoming popular , there were only 2 stds . 
  today there 's over 20 . 
  it would be better for all aspects of society if people were committed to having sex in a monogamous marriage . 
  there would be more stable families ( higher fertility rates , less criminals , happier society , etc ) and the money that 's wasted on disease-ridden fornicators could utilized for other useful scientific research . 
     are you really that dim or just from 700bc ? 
    you can insult me , but that wo n't change facts . 
  continue to wallow in your filth . 
  i 'll just let your words speak for themselves . 
  do n't expect me to try to play chess with a monkey like you seem to be . 
  just no . 
  contraception was specifically invented to allow people to satisfy their sexual desires without having to have offsprings . 
  are you really that dim or just from 700bc ? 
  i said those two viewpoints root in the same problem . 
  i did not say that those two viewpoints result in the same level of extremism . 
  that is exactly what you are doing . 
  i most certainly can . 
  please use google translate to read in english : keep in mind , all of the following articles arguing against v4s opinion substantiate their point with actual arguments . 
  so do n't just call them `` propaganda '' for having a critical point of view , will you ? 
  - faz taking a more neutral and descriptive stance : http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/europa/visegrad-staaten-geschlossen-gegen-merkel-14407312.html - zeit accusing v4 of threatening merkel , taking a negative stance : http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-02/internationale-presseschau-angela-merkel-visegrad-gruppe-fluechtlingspolitik - welt following fazs way of merely describing what happened instead of taking sides : https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article152228130/visegrad-staaten-gegen-deutschlands-migrationspolitik.html - spiegel also sticking to a descriptive point of view rather than an opinionated one : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/visegrad-laender-wollen-weiter-keine-eu-fluechtlingsquoten-a-1153018.html - s\u00dcddeutsche taking an aggressive anti-v4-stance : http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/eu-diplomatie-gespraechs-therapie-1.3137153 - nzz ( german/swiss ) taking a very moderate and differentiated stance on both sides : https://www.nzz.ch/meinung/oesterreich-und-die-oestlichen-nachbarn-ein-gefaehrlicher-riss-durch-die-mitte-europas-ld.152744, 
  dude , i do n't give two cents about what is viewed as `` centric '' or `` right-wing '' in poland . 
  restricting the right to abort as well as the right to contraception in such a way is a prime example of a policy fueled by hatred on women as well as reactionary views in terms of men being the one in charge and all this bullshit that ignores equality of sexes . 
  so stop it with your wannabe-politics-lesson . 
  it 's a fact that these kind of policies pull a country back to a much more brutal past and are based on useless emotions rather than absolute facts . 
  and therefore it is deemed as extremist . 
  `` german media reports '' man , there is no `` german media reports '' . 
  the german media landscape is one of the most diversified there is . 
  newspaper a might contradict newspaper b or might see things differently in general . 
  it most certainly did not .
