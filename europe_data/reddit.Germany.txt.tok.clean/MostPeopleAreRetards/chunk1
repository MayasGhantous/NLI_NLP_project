i 'm planning to walk around 15km a day , so i think 45-50 days . 
  but i have no set schedule , if i like it somewhere i 'll stay for a while . 
  this is just from what i 've read , theft is fairly common on these trails unfortunately . 
  i 'd assume someone who has walked hundreds of kilometres might look at a bike with new found envy . 
  it was n't my intention to insult anyone . 
  i 'm going alone , personally . 
  i expect to make friends along the way , maybe that 'd be an option for you ? 
  maybe a little harder on a bike , but so far , everywhere i have gone alone ( i 've been to over 30 countries so far ) , i made acquaintances and friends , some of which i am still in contact with today . 
  if people walk it , ofcourse you can bike it !, 
  i would probably be very cautious about my bike being secured at night ( pick a ** good ** lock ! ), 
  but other than that , should be fun . 
  i think the spanish route is much more mountainous than the one i am going to do , so maybe , along with the crowded argument , you should look into doing that one ( or another ) aswell . 
  unless you are an experienced biker , then go for the mountains , i guess . 
  [ there is n't really `` the entire thing '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/ways_of_st._james_in_europe.png ) , there are paths all over europe . 
  i consciously decided against the largest one that you refer to as it 's too popular and crowded for me . 
  yes , it 's called the [ camino de santiago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camino_de_santiago ) . 
  i have walked one before , it 's a great experi ~ ~ ment ~ ~ ence . 
  highly recommended . 
  got ta book a flight at some point . 
   i 'll take my chances . 
  aight , so i guess my backpack just got a bit heavier , i better pack some real warm clothes . 
  i mean , wheather is still gon na be better than in germany pretty much whatever happens , so ca n't complain . 
  okay cool . 
  i was wondering if this was temporary or an actual irregularity . 
  i have googled , but afaik this snow has not been projected a week ago either , so i was cautious . 
  sleeping in a tent at below zero is just not fun . 
  honest question : i was going to walk from lisbon to santiago de compostela next week . 
  should i reschedule ? 
  the great thing with the new world order conspiracy theory is that you can put ** everyone ** that is not you and the people you trust in that category . 
  imagine you are a nazi who hates jews . 
  how do you justify hating lgbt ? 
  and muslims ? 
  that 's just uncomfortable . 
  but if you believe there is a secret plan to rule the world , you can put everyone in it !, 
  lgbt ? 
  part of the jews ' plan to destabilize christian values !, 
  muslims ? 
  the illuminati hate white people !, 
  it 's the ultimate victim complex . 
  why would we want or need it ? 
  you ca n't just claim that . 
  i mean , you can , but it makes you an idiot . 
  she is actually extremely similar to hillary clinton . 
  think about where we could be now if the us had n't decided for the shiny orange turd . 
  yep , and if you search for best rated , you will find a bunch of turkish movies with suspiciously similar comments . 
  i 'm curious : what exactly do you think is that mentality ? 
  radical islam is backwards ( same with radical christianity ) , the average muslim is just fine . 
  it 's not race , it 's historical and culture exposure . 
  what would be so wrong about that ? 
  also , i assume you have 8 children to do your part ? 
  hint : muslims ! = refugees . 
  i could have put `` since wwii '' , i thought that was implied . 
  for comparison : would you say `` german/japan/france / whatever ** still ** has a working democracy '' ? 
  you do n't need the still there . 
  sorry , i do n't discuss with nazis , it 's just a general rule i have . 
  also , i am not wrong , read the executive order that proposed voice , nothing specific is in there . 
  but i 'll gladly take your money , do you wan na suggest an escrow ? 
  how much money do you wan na bet ? 
  i would suggest escrow.com or www.barteringzoom.com ( this is through paypal ) for a start . 
  do you wan na bet whether it will be overturned ? 
  i will put up to $ 10k into an escrow we can both agree on if you want . 
  totally serious , by the way . 
  as for voice , it does n't even specify that the people commiting the crimes have to be sentenced in order to be put on the list . 
  it 's a huge cluster fuck that will also lose in every single court it is fought in . 
  but even if it was just those who were sentenced , it 's discriminatory in nature . 
  the difference between statistics about demographics and the lists is anonymity . 
  everyone in the us is technically an immigrant dude , wtf . . that also does n't absolve you of being an asshole . 
  i will repeat , read the judge 's reasoning . 
  he is using the administration 's own words against them , it 's absolutely hilarious !, 
  it 's not gon na be overturned , he is 0-5 . 
  of those countries on the list , 0 people have been committing terror acts in the us since 2000 . 
  zero . 
  even the 9/11 guys were from saudi arabia . 
  donald would have better chances ( and that is : 1 % at best ) of this passing if uae were on the list , but he ca n't do that , he has business ties there . 
  no , islamic terrorism is not a problem to the us . 
  as for `` yeah , i do n't like it . '', 
  that 's a rather calm expression for something that nazi germany has done with [ institute for study of the jewish question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/institute_for_study_of_the_jewish_question ) . 
  this is ** the ** absolute no-go , it 's propaganda and it 's sedition . 
  if you think that is even remotely okay , you are a racist and should immediately reconsider your life choices . 
  thanks , bye . 
  one protest of 2,5 m people in a country of 300m people may seem impressive to you , but for comparison , when iraq war happened , we had a peace protest of almost 1m people - in berlin !, 
  that 's a city of roughly 4 million people . 
  i agree that urban is different , and i know that the us voting system is largely responsible . 
  ** but ** at some point the west coast has to either take some blame or take action and secede . 
  you ca n't shift blame until your country goes to shit . 
  to be fair , at this point i consider the fly-over states and west coast + nyc to be different countries . 
   agreed that exposure and also trump being much more recent has an impact on perception . 
  also , with the us there is hope where there is barely any with russia , so recent developments are much more disappointing . 
  i strongly disgree with you on the wars though , but that 's too complex for this conversation imo , 
  yes it is quasi-fascists imo . 
  the fact that you have to put ** `` still '' ** before `` a working democracy '' speaks volumes . 
  the whole reason i have n't said full-on fascism is that those checks and balances have n't been demoslished ** yet ** . 
  i 'm sorry , but you are cherry picking . 
  you could just as well argue that while russia has annexed crimea , and that is bad , the us has , in the last 70 years , fought 4 + major wars with ** millions ** of casualties , and none of those has been even remotely justified . 
  soo . . by this perimeter the us are the bad guys , would n't you agree ? 
  as for the popular vote : i consider non-voters as being complicit . 
  i consider everyone not constantly on the streets protesting as not doing enough . 
  this is fascism , you have to fight it , the consequences otherwise ** will * be gravely . 
  as a side note : i have been living in america for a year and have gone to school in south dakota . 
  truth is , most people i have met were truly idiots and the education system in your country is a joke .
