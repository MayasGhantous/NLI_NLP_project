  i did n't meet too many russians , maybe that 's why i feel it 's equal . 
  but i do n't consider russia right now as led by white supremacists , just a violent dispot . 
  and russia has less influence on the world than the us has , so potential consequences are more regional . 
  you may point out that they invaded and annexed crimea , and you are right . 
  but the us has fought 4 + major wars in the last 70 years with hundreds of thousands of casualties and i 'd argue none of those wars were even remotely justified . 
  plus , trump wants another nuclear arms race . 
  big no-no . 
  i 'm on mobile , but here : [ federal judge in hawaii freezes president trump 's new entry ban ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/lawyers-face-off-on-trump-travel-ban-in-md-court-wednesday-morning/2017/03/14/b2d24636-090c-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html?utm_term=.e9878c772f60 ) second : [ president donald trump to publish weekly list of crimes committed by immigrants ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-publish-weekly-list-crimes-immigrants-commit-refugees-aliens-executive-order-us-a7546826.html ) and there was this new office with a cool acronym , but i ca n't find sources on that right now thanks to / u/jm-lemmi you will argue it 's not a muslim ban . 
  read the judge 's reasoning to freeze the ban for an explanation why it is . 
  the acronym for the new office was voice . 
  quasi because there are checks and balances still in place . 
  yes . 
  not yet . 
  yes . 
  they do get a bunch of refugees though , so your point is kinda moot . 
  the fact that it is being shut down should not distract from the attempt . 
  again , you do n't seem to understand : i have zero respect for putin and zero respect for trump . 
  i have little respect for russians and little respect for americans . 
  it 's not that we praise russia , we despise the current us . 
  yes , hence why they are `` as trustworthy '' , not more , not less . 
  trying to install a muslim ban is not a thing that germans like to see , for certain reasons . 
  installing an agency that publishes weekly lists of crimes by immigrants has been done in germany before , back then it was the [ `` institute for study of the jewish question '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/institute_for_study_of_the_jewish_question ) . 
  that 's not melodramatic , the us administration is quasi-fascist in its intent and riddled with white supremacists . 
  we do n't like that . 
  it does n't have to affect you directly in order to be outraged . 
  i think it 's not that they give russia a lot of credit , it is that they give the us close to 0 credit right now . 
  which is understable , the us is not a ** reliable ** ally right now , and it is on a downward trajectory . 
  some may be exaggarated , but white supremacy is , for certain reasons , not looked upon kindly in germany . 
  the current us administration is quasi-fascist in it 's intent and riddled with nazis . 
  shhhh , i 'm trying to be neutral here * hints at sweden * do n't ruin it for me . 
  dude . 
  that 's how you start wars , be careful . 
  i do wish that frenchies would actually cook their chicken through and not just throw it on the stove for 15 seconds tho . 
  that 's icky guys !,

  half of our country is kinda flat , can i join ? 
  i love the dutch and tolerate the danes ** and ** swedes as our weird nordic buddies . 
  if you wan na do that , then do it right and source your claims though . 
  the way you guys are going about it , you might as well go : `` yeah-uh '' - `` nuh-uh '' - `` ye-hes '' - `` noooo '' . 
  i was at the one in berlin . 
  pretty okay crowd but only an hour and confined to a small space . 
  i think a march would be much better , or have actual discussion . 
  the way it was conducted , it felt kinda boring and uninspired to be honest . 
  do n't feed the trolls , bro . 
  muikku !, 
  that 's it . 
  the vendor did n't know the english name and i forgot the finnish . 
  damn , i 'm so happy right now , now i just have to find that here . . 
  hey , i have been there !, 
  literally the only picture i took was [ this one ] ( http://puu.sh/uv1n2/357992c7a0.jpg ) . 
  seriously finland , what is wrong with these prices ? 
  5 $ for a couple strawberries ? 
  other than that , helsinki is the most beautiful scandinavian city i have visited so far !, 
  right outside of that market hall was a fish market that was just marvellous , and the ** women ** !, 
  one girl in particular i still remember , i am 100 % convinced she was an angel . 
  edit : [ pic from the fish market ] ( http://puu.sh/uv1zt/4a95e697dd.jpg ) . 
  does anyone know what kind of fish that is right in front behind the potatos and how they were prepared ? 
  f'ing delicious man , i had three portions . 
  stupid german auto-correct on my mobile . 
  :d weeks , obviously . 
  ours sucks , too . 
  just a tad less . 
  right ? 
  i love visiting england and have done so many times . 
  but i do n't see the appeal of living there over most other countries . 
  it 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
  but when the industry you almost solely rely on needs to be weithin the eu , voting for brexit seems like a pretty suicidal economic decision . . 
  oh yeah , that is great too . 
  i was gifted a cookbook solely on stamppot two werks ago !, 
  yes the average is 21 , and the median is close , which makes 14 % miniscule . 
  the finance sector being 13 % of total services is ** extremely ** high , yes . 
  it is not yet comparable to greece , that much i agree with . 
  my comparison started with the finance sector emigrating to within eu border countries . 
  then , i maintain , it is apt . 
  i may have mispresented my point : i do n't think there is much to invest in in the industry sector ( hence `` what do you want to produce ? '' ), 
  unless you wan na build new industry branches completely from scratch . 
  and i do n't think the position the uk has maneuvered itself in warrants any large such investments . . 
  [ the gdp by sector ] ( http://puu.sh/ummor/d15e64586e.png ) tells you otherwise . 
  14,6 % production is minuscule , and of the service percentage , a huge part is finance . 
  [ here ] ( http://puu.sh/ummuc/9e1dfc6628.png ) is sweden for example . 
  [ germany ] ( http://puu.sh/ummwx/3a00e6f6d4.png ) [ greece ] ( http://puu.sh/ummfd/3410400198.png ) has the same problem as the uk - banks , and we know how well they are doing . 
  if and when the uk loses the banking sector , you are looking at greece-levels of sustainability . 
  for more examples , go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_ < -- insert country here my comment was n't hostile , it 's just the truth . 
  the economy of the uk lives and dies with the finance sector . 
  and what do you propose the uk should produce ? 
  you literally have no ressources , very little know-how ( as a whole ) and are famous for nothing much . . 
  my question is , why would anyone even wan na live in the uk ? 
  most places worth living are so retardedly expensive you have to live 1 hour away from it to make it somewhat sustainable , they have almost no industry other than finance ( and that 'll leave , too ) and the weather sucks most of the year , too . 
  i would live in almost any other european country before i 'd move to the uk . 
  most people limit themselves too much when it comes to stampot . 
  you should try endive stampot , or spinach stampot for that matter . 
  there are hundreds of different variations and most are better than the standard you get served everywhere . 
  went to an electronic store to buy an ipod ( long time ago ) in the south of france . 
  no one in the store seemed to speak a word of english . 
  as i do n't understand french , i said i would just buy it somewhere else . 
  suddenly , the guy spoke fluent english and was willing to help me out . 
  french people are definitely very proud of their language , afaik there is even legislation to preserve it .
