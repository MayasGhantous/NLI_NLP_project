  knock yourself out and check the [ war nerd archives ] ( http://exile.ru/articles/list.php?iblock_id=35&amp;section_id=156 ) of exile.ru . 
  if you 're in it for the style , you 'll also probably enjoy the [ book reviews ] ( http://exile.ru/authors/detail.php?id=2257 ) by the same author . 
  it 's pathos , but good pathos . 
  once you read past that , the war nerd articles can be pretty enlightening . 
  other than that , they are always a good read . 
  mmh , the author actually lived in russia for almost a decade ( the war nerd is not the fresno data entry guy he claims to be ),

  roughly at the end of the 10th century the bavarians started to catapult their freaks over the alps . 
  the rest is history , leading up to hitler . 
   i interpret the liberals ' german bashing as having an entirely different motivation -- their inherent dislike of economic success . 
  mmph, 
  yeah , a friend of mine started dating his 16 year old girlfriend when he was 24 . in the rural parts of east germany where i grew up no fucks were given . 
  now they 're married with children . 
  simpsons , besides famous gaffes like the famous `` tr\u00e4ne im raumzeitgef\u00fcge '' , is pretty good , too . 
  [ mmh yeah ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wtnv3z_e64 ), 
  in the berlin/brandenburg area there 's a most peculiar threat : * `` ich mach dir gleich licht ans rad , freundchen . 
  '' * `` i 'll fix the lights on your bike real quick , little friend . '', 
  sure . 
  they are the most successful economically , in fact , and the most important of the [ * geberl\u00e4nder * ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a4nderfinanzausgleich ) , i.e. 
  the state that pays the most for other states in the framework of the german transfer-union . 
  it was n't always this way and , if you look at the table in the wikipedia article , managed to turn from taker to giver at the end of the 80s . 
  mmh , for one , working mothers are n't regarded as * rabenm\u00fctter * ( as much ) as they are in the south . 
  especially in the east that stigma is nonexistent .

  the aldis here in berlin just suck . 
  lidl and penny are better discounters imho . 
   by that very first line , you have already shown your bias on this matter . 
  it is the epitome of arrogance to declare that those who do not treat every view as equally rational , as being biased and unwilling to engage in discussion . 
      see ? 
  i can do it too . 
  except in your case , it makes no sense . 
  germany has no statute of limitations regarding murder ( since 1979 ) . 
  the report itself is from german tv , though , and the translation is not manipulative , either . 
  it said `` radical jihadists '' instead of `` jihadists '' , for example , but that 's about it . 
  except your comment i replied to contained nothing regarding the nsa but mentioned an ominous planned ` global currency reset ', 
   and this does n't at least give you a hint that maybe fucking tens of millions of people around europe might be in on something ?

  some kindergartens introduced pork-free lunch because they felt that every child should get the same food to avoid any exclusion . 
  i do n't see where you get ` fear ' from that .
