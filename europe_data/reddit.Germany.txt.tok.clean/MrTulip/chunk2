  every day payments in the range that would require a 500 $ note are most probably conducted electronically . 
  i do n't know why germany would have pushed for a 500 $ note but people simply paying for stuff seems unlikely . 
   i think most of them circulate in germany , where people often pay with big notes i think you 're talking out of your ass a little bit here . 
  nice how you threw criticism of israel and holocaust denial together . 
  probably because this kind of stuff sells newspapers in serbia .

  there are people who survive with a 6h/day cleaning job which nets you 9,50 . in geriatric care almost no one works full-time and care assistants earn 10-12 $ / hour . 
  it 's possible to have a low-skill job , work part time and to support yourself . . 
  making food less british should be a u.n. directive, 
  ah , to be fourteen again . . 
   for example , there is a nation wide strike of nurses , why ? 
  because they have been getting paid nearly the same for 15 years . 
  please do n't change this . 
  our geriatric care system would collapse without the excellent polish nurses . 
  what is it with accounts only a few months old and idiotic comments ? 
  so . . not nordic after all ? 
  no , it was n't .

  a few years ago the conditions for asylum seekers in greece were recognized [ as inhumane by the ministry of the interior ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/asylverfahren-in-der-eu-wir-schicken-keinen-mehr-zu-den-griechen-zurueck-1577805.html ) , so no asylum seekers that entered through greece will be sent back there when they reach germany .

  meh , shrooms do n't grow in the forest but mostly on cow pastures . 
  why would anyone stay in albania or serbia ffs ? 
  most new workers in geriatric care , even in just a * praktikum * , are actually from albania and we would be sad to see them go , not only because there 's an actual shortage in this low skill , high stress environment but because they 're highly motivated . 
  the refugees do n't want shelter and food , they want to actually live , you know ? 
  so out of 800 , 65 where already sufficiently fluid in german ? 
  this is changing . 
  but i 've worked in a holiday job as cleaning crew at a fair with double phds from ukraine , for example , who always had a shot of wodka with their coffee . . 
  pretty much synonymous with belgium, 
  there is actually a lack of workers in geriatric care , for example , a low skill high stress job . 
  not enough germans want to to this job apparently , even in areas with relatively high unemployment . 
  the two albanian lasses who do a * praktikum * at my workplace on the other hand are highly motivated and now in fear of being deported after the balkans will be declared safe countries of origin . 
  the german government recently also approved over 600 foreign diploma as equal to their german counterparts , 400 of those in the medical area , as there 's also a shortage of doctors in rural and * strukurschwachen * areas , both general doctors and specialists . 
  a lot of the doctors in polyclinics and rehabilitation centers already are from syria , iran etc.

  while i 'm no political scientist , a quick read of the article reveals the following : during a power struggle with the army the akp emphasized a civilian approach ( step forward ) , then , after gaining control over the military , returned to a military approach ( step backward ) . 
  it does n't really contradict anything in the war nerd article , just offers a good overview of the recent years in the akp-army-kurd relationship . 
  crosspost from [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/3fitb4/war_nerd_dont_be_fooled_turkey_is_attacking_the/ ) . 
  full text in case the article goes dark again : if you 're a trusting type , you might be cheering for the turkish air force , which according to the more gullible news services has finally decided to strike islamic state ( is ) targets in syria . 
  do n't believe it . 
  it 's not is the turkish planes have been bombing . 
  here 's a breakdown of the actual targets of the turkish airstrikes : the attack on is was a single sortie against limited targets and closer to the turkish border , while the one against the pkk was much different . 
  the air force dispatched 75 f-16s and f-4e 2020s in three waves during july 24-26 . 
  some 300 smart bombs were dropped in 185 sorties against approximately 400 pkk targets . 
  the turkish raids were almost insulting in their bait-and-switch : one little strike on islamic state , or a nice vacant lot that might once have been visited by is . 
  and then 300 sorties , with the best us air-to-ground ordnance you can buy , killing god knows how many hundreds or thousands of kurdish socialist fighters . 
  oh , and by the way , do n't expect most western leftists to shed any tears over those dead socialist fighters . 
  you 'd think western lefties would be happy that a radical-feminist , non-sectarian , aggressively pro-lgbt , egalitarian/socialist militia is taking back ground from the most reactionary , sectarian killers on earth . 
  the most you can hope for is guarded silence . 
  kurds make them nervous for reasons i 'd rather not think about . 
  nobody much likes the kurds , especially erdogan 's ak party . 
  in fact , the akp hates the kurds so much that this shared hobby of kurd-killing has been the beginning of a beautiful friendship between the turkish military and is . 
  is fighters have always been able to move easily over the turkish border , and there are persistent reports that erdogan 's daughter herself is playing their florence nightingale , patching up those rapists ' boo-boos in one of the quasi-secret hospitals along the border . 
  the akp 's position is simple : they hate the kurds , period . 
  islamic state also hates the kurds . 
  so erdogan has to force himself to mouth even the slightest objection to is , whereas the spittle really flies when he starts ranting against the kurdish pkk/ypg . 
  and what makes erdogan maddest of all is that the young women and men of the ypg/j keep winning . 
  that 's the real reason turkey has launched every fighter-bomber it 's got , after years of watching indifferently as is spread over syria and iraq : because the kurds were coming closer to raqqa and jarabulus every day , and had to be stopped .
