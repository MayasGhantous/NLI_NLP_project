  the kurds have been gaining ground in turkey itself too , and that upsets the akp more than anything the kurdish militia is doing south of the border . 
  the turkish/kurdish party hdp took a huge chance in the 2015 turkish elections , and won . 
  the gamble was that the party could draw some non-kurdish voters sick of erdogan 's quasi-fascist antics to cross the 10 % margin it needed to get seats in parliament . 
  the hdp 's best previous showing was 9.77 % ; if it stayed at that level , it would end up with nothing based on the election rules , and put the akp back in power . 
  but the hdp passed the 10 % hurdle , winning over many turks and alevi , getting more than 13 % of the vote , winning 80 seats . 
  thanks mostly to the success of the hdp , erdogan 's akp lost its majority for the first time in more than ten years . 
  they were seriously pissed off , and they 're not over-delicate people . 
  erdogan 's demographic is turkey 's redstaters , inland reactionary hicks , like i said a long time ago . 
  people like that do n't mind a little blood . 
  red-staters like a good killer ; lt. `` rusty '' calley was everybody 's friend in the georgia hinterlands . 
  actually , it 's a good exercise , transferring what 's happening in turkey/syria to the us . 
  imagine ( and it takes some imagining , i admit ) that a truly noble , progressive , socialist movement took over northern mexico . 
  it would be a godsend for the people there , but you think the us would stand for it ? 
  the f-16s would be flying day and night to wipe those do-gooders out . 
  and that 's what the turkish af is busy doing right now , while pretending to attack is . 
  in reality , the turkish military has stepped in to keep is in power from total collapse against the kurdish advance . 
  it was the kurds ' military victories , combined with the hdp 's electoral success , that finally drove erdogan 's akp right over the edge . 
  you may recall a little town called kobane kicked up some dust last winter , when the kurdish kids of the ypg/j stopped the supposedly unstoppable is forces dead , killing something like 3000 of them in the ruins before the caliph finally pulled his brain-dead war tourists from dusseldorf and marseille back south . 
  welp , the kurds pursued . 
  they pushed out from kobane , west , south , and east -- every direction except north , because that 's turkey , where the very existence of kurds was denied until recently . 
  when kobane failed to fall on schedule , the kurds held three `` cantons '' in northern syria , separated by hostile turf . 
  but they kept pushing , and there were signs that the jihadis of is , always bragging about how eager they were to get their precious deaths , were n't in such a hurry to die anymore . 
  in fact , they were starting to break . 
  in mid-june 2015 , ypg units pushing east from kobane and west from hasakeh took tal abyad , uniting two out of the three cantons of syria in one continuous strip of land along the turkish border . 
  this was not supposed to happen , in the smug little world inhabited by mr. erdogan and his islamist buddies . 
  the idea was to sic is on the kurds , then mop them up when they 'd killed those crazy socialist kids . 
  now those kids were in charge of a huge stretch of northern syria , waving to their kurdish kin across the border in turkey , where hating kurds is a national sport . 
  after the ypg/j took tal abyad , islamic state was in a hopeless position . 
  unless the turks intervened . 
  no more wave-throughs across the border , no more easy delivery of munitions and medicines to the boys in raqqa . 
  and the kurds soon turned south , pushing against raqqa itself . 
  they took ayn issa , the only major town between kobane and raqqa , a week after meeting up in tal abyad . 
  suddenly is was breaking in every front where it faced the kurds . 
  failing on the battlefield , they went back to what they do best -- killing 32 young kurdish socialists in a suicide bombing in suruc , just across the border from kobane . 
  turkish collusion was all over that massacre , but that shit only works on people who have n't been through the hell which is kurdish history . 
  the ypg/j vowed revenge and marched on . 
  revenge was n't long coming , either ; the ypg/j took sarrin on july 26-27 2015 . 
  sarrin is on the euphrates , with an important bridge over the river ( which is more like a lake around there , thanks to the dam ) . 
  is should have been able to hold sarrin indefinitely , but their scumbag men were running , not fighting : some of [ the islamic state fighters in sarrin ] drop their weapons and run away when they see us . 
  they are running away now . 
  we are on top of a hill in sarrin , '' said one kurdish fighter . 
  sarrin is perfectly positioned to cut off the town of jarabulus from all contact with is hq in raqqa . 
  and that matters a lot , because the area between jarabulus and a\u2019zaz to the west is the last strip of turkish border still held by turkish intel 's little friends in is . 
  better yet , this strip includes dabiq , the town is named its house mag after , the glossy little number that published those famous articles justifying selling yazidii women and girls as sex slaves . 
  it would n't do , if you 're one of erdogan 's generals , to let the kurdish commies take dabiq , let alone jarabulus , which was the site of is 's first grandiose `` emirate '' in northern syria . 
  if ypg/j had been allowed to advance across the euphrates , breaking up the `` emirate '' around jarabulus , and liberating dabiq , is would n't just be defeated , it 'd be laughed at . 
  and if there 's one thing slave-selling jihadis do n't enjoy , it 's people laughing at them . 
  or with them . 
  or anywhere near them . 
  so the turkish air force is sending the best planes and munitions the us can send them to wipe out these pesky kids in ypg/j , while making noises about giving their is clients a good spanking . 
  at the moment , the turkish generals are claiming they 're only hitting pkk/ypg in northern iraq , but there are already reports of turkish strikes on kurdish targets in syria . 
  it 's inevitable that the turkish military will focus on those targets once it 's done its job of distracting the gullible media with this pantomime strike on is . 
  ypj/g is the most heroic group i 've seen since i started writing about war . 
  so it makes perfect sense that everybody wants to wipe them out .
