  why do you keep spamming the same copypasta with different accounts to different subreddits ?

  damn lazy swamp germans . . 
   first they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win . 
  a quote by a winner . 
  `` first they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then you lose '' would n't make for good friendship book entry . 
  just looked into that , too , and apparently my water usage is n't even recorded - i pay a percentage based on the water usage of the whole building and the size of my flat . 
  i 've got some nouns for you , bitch  verkehrsinfrastrukturfinanzierungsgesellschaftsgesetz  verm\u00f6genszuordnungszust\u00e4ndigkeits\u00fcbertragungsverordnung  elektrizit\u00e4tsversorgungsunternehmen there 's more where that came from . . 
   1 ) the us was between english and greek when it was choosing its `` official language '' . 
  [ we have this myth , too ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/zwiebelfisch/onionfish-german-as-the-official-language-of-the-usa-a-306711.html ), 
  i see . 
  what 's your stance on * schluckimpfungen * ? 
  is the blood alcohol test for drunk drivers a ` crass violation of human rights ' in your eyes , too ? 
  anyway , there 's a qualitative difference beyond both ( vaccination , forced sterilisation ) being technically violations of bodily integrity . 
  one is a prick with a needle that can eradicate centuries-old diseases ( when mandatory ) and the other is permanently taking away a person 's ability to reproduce , often with a surgical procedure . 
  i do n't see a problem of adding vaccinations to the already existing pool of legal limitations of the right to bodily integrity . 
  yes , other than that . 
  can you see having mandatory vaccinations leading to forced sterilization in any way , shape or form ? 
  is n't this like the slippery slope fallacy ? 
  east germany had mandatory vaccinations from the start and they did n't expand from there to mandatory removal of the freedom gland . 
  if we 're talking vaccinations , yes . 
   gott ( 75 ) is still active checkmate , atheists . 
  [ here 's a clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj2lckdru0o ) that demonstrates that audiences should always be on their toes when stewart lee is in the house \\ ^ ^ . 
  same with ehec bacteria in 2011 . first the papers were absolutely sure that [ spanish cucumbers were responsible ] ( http://www.welt.de/gesundheit/article13395659/spanische-salatgurken-sind-der-ehec-traeger.html ) , a few weeks later it came to light that the source had been a [ northern-german bio farmer ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/freispruch-fuer-gurken-tomaten-und-salat-ehec-erreger-auf-sprossen-nachgewiesen-1657513.html ) . 
  i 've actually looked that clip up , too , some time ago . 
  stewart lee 's stage persona is just that and one should never take it at face value . 
  carpet remnant world had some bits about thatcher that at least are disputed . 
  does n't make it less funny imho . 
  that or yellow press . 
  tabloids all over europe used 4th reich etc. 
  crap . 
  * karel gott , * die goldene stimme von prag * , is a household name among older people and sold millions of records both in east and west germany . 
  sang the title theme of [ biene maja for german television ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wmjegpo6nm ) . 
  not * exactly * the same , but i think [ udo j\u00fcrgens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55hcpt_pcgc ) is comparable in terms of name recognition , success and general cheese level . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7cnmq4l9pc ), 
  i 've spent the last 10 minutes looking for an article about fairly recently declassified dossiers by american diplomats that describe him as cocky , volatile and capricious . 
  yeah , helmut schmidt 's arrogance is legendary . 
   i think the problem is that your grasp of english is n't as good as you think . 
  just a typo , mate . 
   either way , we should not consider children guilty or responsible for the sins of their ancestors . 
  no one does that , it is n't about some personal kind of guilt , * historische schuld * refers to the responsibility of germany as a whole to own up to its past . 
  i honestly do n't know enough about macroeconomics and the existing european treaty framework to have an informed opinion on the matter . 
  well , the introduction shows the thoughts of an old greek who lived under actual german occupation and how this influences his view on today 's situation . 
  his view his not an objective assessment of the situation but is presented in the article for the reader to make up his own mind . 
   i do n't understand why the author keeps using an objective frame for these . 
  why ca n't he say `` germany 's perceived historic guilt '' ? 
  christ , would he write `` greece 's historic laziness '' or `` greece 's perceived laziness '' ? 
  historic guilt is often used interchangeably with historic responsibility when it comes the second world war and the holocaust . 
  maybe you should read the whole article . 
  should have taken you less time than writing up this post .

  corresponding article to the [ spiegel cover ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zu3mr/der_spiegel_cover_today/ ) that rustled some jimmies a few days ago, 
  good old * fugen-s * , separating the native speakers from the rabble \\ ^ ^, 
  what is perfectly ridiculous is the absolute tone deafness to the fact that this cover is a grade a satire of the perception of germany in the yellow press of other european countries . 
  get stick out of ass , have laugh . 
  more like a new low of germans ' desperate struggle to understand satire . . 
  i 've grabbed you from behind !, 
  now lead me to your pot of gold !, 
  i have n't read the corresponding article but would n't this be about the perception of germany by other european populations ? 
  like the 4th reich bullshit from greek or british tabloids ? 
  so is n't this title page just a satirical depiction of a misconception ? 
  poland is doing pretty well on her own . 
  was going to post the exact same list . . central yuropean master race , i guess . .

   large cities , of which the latter can only exist by the grace of capitalism . 
  that , too . 
  but when applying the now more common meaning of development status east germany was a dilapidated first world country running on fumes . 
   east germany was a 3rd world country bullshit .

  [ there was a spiegel article ] ( http://ts.gseclan.de/spgl.15.09.pdf ) ( page 26 ) in a recent print issue that sheds some light on the forced loan and that german politicians at the time of the * 2 +4 vertr\u00e4ge * were well aware of it and did everything to avoid a payment to greece . 
  this is an excellent article which should have made it to the english section of spiegel online . 
  nah , that was twoflowers ( zweiblum in german ) afair .

  so you believe in a higher power that demands a relatively chaste and virtuous life but the thing you 're most proud of is the bodies of your women ? 
  be that as it may , i understand religion quite well , i just do n't take it very seriously . 
  anyway , thanks for the banter . 
  and keep your hands over your sheets or a timeless superbeing might torture you for all eternity !, 
  well , the body is the last refuge nowadays , is n't it ? 
  of what exactly ? 
  it 's a terry pratchett character . 
  so , surely you 're just projecting your envy of central europe and resentment of germanic people on me . 
  why would i be ? 
  i 'm not bitter that i 'm not austrian , either . 
  on the contrary . 
  eastern europeans live in denial but deep inside know it to be true : it 's good to be german . 
  eh , greetings to the country of roma , anyway .

  refugees ca n't vote . 
  i sure hope so . 
  but there 's a tendency in solyanka territory to more social conservatism atm . 
  of course not . 
  but the acceptance of homosexuality actually shrinking over the past decade , not just in poland , is a bit worrying to me tbh .
