  social acceptance of homosexuality [ is one of the lowest in europe ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/ ), 
  btw : an [ article + map ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/05/a-revealing-map-of-the-countries-that-are-most-and-least-tolerant-of-homosexuality/ ) on the social acceptance of homosexuality in the world . 
  sadly , pretty incomplete . 
  well , romania = the nation of roma , duh . 
  i was born in the gdr and spent some time in it . 
  so i do understand to some extent . 
  if there are no other rules in place , lowest common denominator shitposts slowly become normalized as a sub gets new users who think that 's how we do it around here and the overall niveau suffers . 
  let 's make a shitpost sunday or something . 
  too many fluff posts make a sub turn to shit, 
  finally, 
  do n't nurse your grudges or you 'll end up like a balkan nation, 
  oh , fuck off already, 
  why not ? 
   please . 
  self awareness . 
  please . 
  yeah , man . 
  at this point you 're only trolling yourself . 
   you 're a cutie are n't you . 
  the comeback of a twelve-year-old . 
  what 's next ? 
  `` you seem upset '' ? 
   glad i could spend so much time in your head . 
  do you have no one in real life to think of you , even negatively ? 
   too much hurts your brain ... clearly . 
  apparently , the last stage of that brain damage is becoming a regular on the_donald ... clearly . 
   haha . 
  you 're in a comments thread of a post with 50 pictures of angela merkel . 
  you are , too , btw . 
  is being an idiot a requirement for posting there or is this what t_d does to you ?

  this is some dumb crap already and it 's just 8:30 am here . 
  the rest of the party program of the afd ( aside from being anti-refugee ) is so reactionary and retarded that a nuclear bomb has to go off in munich before they 'll be in government . 
  well , no shit . 
  lads , it 's the fn . 
  i think portugal is pretty much well liked here since the hatemongering by tabloids etc has been largely focused on greece . 
  man , i hate those greeks . . 
  this will be right at home at / r/conspiracy, 
   criticism of germany is forbidden oh , really ? 
  anyway , this blog is highly amusing . 
   so if these politicans say that other countries needs to cut back debt than they must say in the same phrase that germany have to cut back these savings . 
  explain, 
  at least he will make for some entertaining one-liners/gaffes, 
  oh , another bumblingmumbling alt ... 
  holy fuck , german intellectual life truly is in a sad state . . 
  holy shit . 
  leave that drivel over at / r/mensrights ffs . 
   a person put into a position must have the ability for it , and it is the ability that causes the promotion . 
  if that was the case , there would n't be the need for affirmative action laws . 
   we do n't get money in germany anymore since a lot of homeless people would donate blood just for the money err , the charit\u00e9 pays 20 $ and some of the donors there are clearly junkies ( pinhead pupils ) or alcoholics and there 's a bunch of private companies that also pay 20 $ for blood and plasma , there 's even one that pays 70 $ for your plasma if you took part in their rabies immunization program before, 
  there are also a lot of old plants being shut down . 
  and which scholars would that be ? 
  a lot of criticism towards israel is coopted by real antisemites who just exchange ` jews ' with ` zionists ' in their rhetoric . 
  see / r/conspiracy and / r/worldpolitics . 
   semites are n't just jews not that shit again . 
  is that willful ignorance ? 
  please read up on the history and definition of the term antisemitism . 
  dw is the international branch of german public broadcasting and news and maybe comparable to bbc world or france 24 . my personal submission policy is loosely based on the idea that redditors from all over the world contribute perspectives from their corner of the world . 
  which basically leaves me with spiegel , dw and the odd thelocal or presseurop article . 
  too bad other publications do n't have an english section , not only german ones btw , i really would like to see more stuff from france etc. 
  but i digress . 
   it 's about time feminists said something about this sort of thing , instead of complaining about whether we should have unisex restrooms or `` sexist '' words or other relatively inane shit . 
  lame false dichotomy . 
  and upvoted till kingdom come . 
  15.000 seems to be the magic number of members a subreddit can take before slowly turning bad . 
   i 'm sorry , but the word `` cunt '' is not comparable to being killed for being raped . 
  so who does this except for your strawman ? 
  yes . 
  feels a bit [ like this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anbzsnjx9q#t=5m03s ) . 
  last happy moment before recession hits . 
  [ `` soviet zone gabi and her first banana '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kuk8k.jpg ), 
  please keep this shit to / r/worldpolitics, 
  if you brought that during the third reich you probably would have been shot due to * grober unfug * and * beleidigung des f\u00fchrers *  . 
  seriously . 
   most likely nowhere near as bad as it 's been said i 'd probably think that , too , if i was only reading blogs with questionable content that has been debunked decades ago . 
  also , if one really needs to feel pride in a country 's past and not only in current developments one had a part in then it would be dishonest to not feel a little shame for the atrocities of the past . 
  afaik the sun, 
  probably dates back to east germany university . 
  her whole diction and speech cadence is eerily similar to that of * pionierleiters * and * staatsb\u00fcrgerkundelehrers * back in the day . 
  mmh , yes , around 77 % and rising . . 
  idiots abroad, 
  the grundgesetz was clearly written with a classic nation state in mind . 
  it 's only logical that the integration of countries into a supranational structure is going to rustle some legal jimmies . 
  the rent in the east is pretty low compared to the west , for example . 
  i know . 
  sometimes i try to remember the anthem and hum the east german one instead . 
   so what you are saying is , it 's not a nazi uniform ? 
  because as far as i know , the wehrmacht was n't ` nazi ' . 
  at least not all of them ... nnggghh, 
  as much as we dislike grammar , apparently . 
  [ auferstanden aus ruinen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtv92wqyjfa ) , the anthem of east germany . 
  somehow a mixture between an hommage to the * deutschlandlied * and russian influences . 
  pretty good . 
  did they really make it ? 
  i 've seen a * very * similar map some time ago without the krautchan mascot . 
  these companies shown here have , of course , a lot of branches in the east and berlin . 
  also , there are many small niche companies too small to show up on the map . 
  furthermore , what criteria have been used to select these companies ? 
  $ : accidentally word, 
  daily show , colbert report and sometimes / r/politics .
