  there are ron paul supporters in germany , ffs .

   i also demand that big ben be at least an inch higher up than the eiffel tower compensation for that penis survey ? 
  no , really . 
  when the stimulus package ( in the u.s. ) was all over the media there were also some interesting numbers from studies that showed that , for example , infrastructure spending has a return value of around 1.50 $ on the dollar . 
  fake edit : just saw that another redditor [ at least provided some diagrams ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vomq1/france_increases_minimum_wage/c56dvqw ) . 
  no , it 's because everyone not living in africa seems to trace back to a group of only several thousand people who narrowly survived an immense volcanic eruption which limits the genetic variety . 
  a german and a japanese genome are much more similar than that of a north and south african .

   for the same reason i want to preserve amazon tribes , californian sequoias , and siberian tigers . 
  such diversity enriches the world . 
  when everyone thinks and looks the same , the world is poorer . 
  even if the phenotypes converge , why would you assume that  everyone thinks the same ? 
  why would you want to preserve different phenotypes ? 
  anyway , great example of how the far right adapts the vocabulary and buzzwords of the mainstream . 
  phenotypical genocide , lol . 
   this is about preserving the fragile swedish race , which has less than 8,000,000 specimens left , approximately 0.1 % of the world 's population . 
  human `` races '' ! = different species . 
  some of these comments here sure are . . 
  genetic diversity is best ensured my mixture of different people . 
  90 % of all genetic diversity lies in africa - to ensure biodiversity everyone should have children with africans . 
   the most moronic thing about the nazi blond fetish is that the person putting it forward the most , the leader of the nazis , was n't blond at all . 
  the most moronic thing is the racist pseudoscientific theory itself . 
  now just post that inane ` antiracist = antiwhite ' rant that the likes of you seem to take for pure intellectual mana and the circle of derp is complete, 
  * soon *, 
   fascist ideologies are most appealing to young people who feel alienated from society , especially if they have trouble finding jobs . 
  and you find it surprising that some western youths flock to them ? 
  the overall number of these convertites is very small but enough to make them overproportionally represented in the group of salafists .

  so what 's the deal with eastern europe and their anachronistic nativism ?

  my grandmother , her brother and my grandaunt are from the teplice area and were afraid to visit their hometown in the first decades after the war , fearing the locals would recognize them as germans .

  yes , schr\u00f6der [ fired his defense minister , too ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/19/world/fg-rudi19 ) . 
  truly the ejector seat position of german high politics . 
  the term racism has long transcended its original biologistic meaning and encompasses negative discrimination based on ethnicity and culture , too . 
  these are examples for their `` their anti-german , anti-eu stance '' and at least the * gauleiter * bit is evidence for a chauvinistic and condescending attitude that 's not quite racism but * close * to it , just as city_zoo wrote , especially coming from a supposedly serious newspaper . 
  [ germany has every right to impose a gauleiter on greece ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jeremywarner/100014524/germany-has-every-right-to-impose-a-gauleiter-on-greece/ ) [ germany 's smear campaign against greece ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100014963/germany-is-playing-with-greek-fire/ ) [ europe 's blithering idiots and their flim-flam treaty ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100013758/europes-blithering-idiots-and-their-flim-flam-treaty/ ) usually it 's more subtle and refined than this - like the old trick of a little self-deprecation followed by an insult that 's just a bit more severe etc.

  lusatia , my * heimat * is home to a bunch of easter traditions which are heavily influenced by the sorbs , a slav minority . 
  there 's [ egg painting ] ( http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/photos+traditional+lusatian+sorbian+folk+easter+painting/6360761/story.html ) with [ intricate patterns ] ( http://avaxnews.com/appealing/sorbians_prepare_easter_eggs.html ) and [ egg rolling ] ( http://www.spreewald-info.com/de/land_leute/braeuche/ostern/waleien_spreewald.php ) . 
  a more common tradition in germany is the easter egg hunt ( which my grandma arranged for us until she died - we were in our late twenties ) and the [ easter bonfires ] ( http://www.nachtausgabe.de/blog/star_fm_presents_das_osterfeuer_in_der_kultur ) all over the country where people stare into the fire while getting hammered and maybe listening to music acts . 
  also , church going is pretty common but mostly as a community event where the atheists ( 75 % in the east ) also show up to enjoy the get together . 
  families get together and enjoy easter feasts .

  because sexism does n't exist and the pay gap is there because women get pregnant , duh . 
   hurr i am calling people nerd on the internet . 
  not calling you a nerd but my point was that if you do n't just stay in one place you 'll see some neo-nazis pretty soon . 
   i do n't know . 
  i 've been living in sachsen for 6 months and never saw '' nazis '' . 
  do you ever leave your house ? 
  btw , only a fraction of nazis sports the classic skinhead look , most wear jeans and poloshirt with black-red-white collar and it 's been the trend for a while now to imitate classic far left outfits like black hoodies etc.
