  your partner has to pass tests like for language , cultural knowledge , reach a certain education level , be qualified for a job , working first on a special visa for a few years till he/she gets a permission to stay , etc. 
  i have nothing against it if the state helps funding this , but if a realistic period passes and the goals are not reached then go back to your country and do the same visa process again . 
  a third chance you will get after a few years pass . 
  this promoted political correctness bullshit is ruining us . 
  till this does n't change , i am against the eu project . 
  edit : happy birthday eu, 
  you will be downvoated for this because muh bacon meme . 
  now imagine what happens in other countries with less regulations , like china , russia or arab countries . 
  it 's pure fucking horror , but people tend to ignore it because of the shocking treatment of animals . 
  is there something anyone can do to help ? 
  for [ slavic mythology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_mythology ) , i would recommend you : * franjo ledi\u0107 : mitologija slavena - tragom kultova i vjerovanja starih slavena ; tiskara epoha , zagreb , 1969 . 
  you could almost say grillo a comedian or something . 
  i am fucking surprised . 
  thanks for clarification . 
  i thought you want the opposite . 
  there needs to be one powerful person who starts a campaign and your career is over . 
  also , death threats from extremists . 
  trump had a great life . 
  success , money , power , women , became president of the most powerful country . 
  i do n't know about you , but i would like to step in his shoes . 
   at this point , who the hell cares ? 
  political suicide,

  i never understood this approach to election . 
  is it really more important to elect a woman , transgender gay , muslim or whatever than a competent politician ? 
   it 's not like we 've been intentionally keeping our population low i know , but my point was that it is not always negative if the population decreases . 
  make ru happen !, 
  apparently japan ca n't have trade deals with other countries . 
  if you need a subreddit to learn social skills , then you are a hopeless case . 
   public school ? 
  i have never met anyone who went to private school . 
  are there many people in germany who go to private schools ? 
  where the last parts of the byzantine empire remain . 
  that 's when you invest your karma in turkish content . 
  a few years ago / r/europe hated orban and made jokes about him , but during the peak of the refugee crisis he was praised and merkel hated . 
  now everyone loves merkel because she `` rekt '' trump . 
  there are many other examples . 
  you just have to wait till what popular culture sees as opposition to turkey ( and islam ) fails , then everyone will upvoat your post . 
  but i agree , turkish culture is not very popular on here . 
  nobody forbids you to post them . 
  they are also humans and therefore they deserve to be remembered . 
  you are right , it should be forgotten . 
  tells you something about what kind of personality is needed to be on the top of the g8 countries .

  ave maria !, 
  how successful was he in polish politics ? 
  what bothers me is that people say it is a signal to the nationalists . 
  people should stil be talking about the causes of the rise of parties like afd and front national . 
  it 's not a new rethoric they suddenly discovered and influenced people by anger and lies . 
  many parties were just doing a shitty job , that 's why people are looking for alternatives . 
  saying things like `` those stupid nationalists did n't win '' takes away the attention to the real issues and makes the parties who did a shitty job look like heroes who saved europe again , while the issues stay . 
  then you get protests and you hear again `` look at those stupid nationalists '' . 
   all because of a charismatic new leader that resembles the canadian prime minister . 
  let me guess , when they talked in the media about groenlinks , they were mostly talking about the look of the leader and less about the actual political ptogram . 
  that 's how you can get many voters , with image and the poeple love it more than boring politics . 
  well , i am not a smart man . 
  you can never be sure on the internet if someone is joking or not . 
  because there are enough idiots who see turkey as their home country . 
  [ example ] ( https://youtu.be/p-2givsn0wk?t=47s ) in sarajevo , when turkey won against croatia . 
  how did bosnia get dragged into this ? 
  uneducated idiots who crave for pride somewhere else , because their country is fucked up . 
  he loves bosnia so much that he does n't give a shit about political consequences in the country . 
  just do n't read/translate the comments on the website, 
  why are you triggered ? 
  it was a joke . 
  i do n't really mean to force 15 million people to convert . 
  nailed the bulgarian folk costume http://i.imgur.com/2cmdgmy.jpg, 
  south slavs ( and honorary slavs ) stronk, 
  you are now the mod of / r/byzantium, 
  and the land in bosnia is getting sold out to arabs, 
  if it would be finish elections then i would not be surprised if it realle were a death metal party . 
   catholics we should always try to evangelize . 
  true , thanks for the reminder . 
  may god bless you too, 
  you are right , but there 's nothing wrong to make an observation that people turn away from god . 
  take for example 2 timothy 3:1 -5 :  but understand this , that in the last days there will come times of difficulty . 
  for people will be lovers of self , lovers of money , proud , arrogant , abusive , disobedient to their parents , ungrateful , unholy , heartless , unappeasable , slanderous , without self-control , brutal , not loving good , treacherous , reckless , swollen with conceit , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god , having the appearance of godliness , but denying its power . 
  avoid such people . 
  another religion does n't mean from the catholic point of view that they are turned also to god . 
  religion is a personal thing for me but it does n't make for me impossible to translate it to a more materialist perspective , even if that way it looses its meaning . 
  where do you think i made a mistake ? 
   this is ~ ~ priceless ~ ~ fascism . 
  ca n't stop laughing typical european / s, 
  til canada has adopted nazi germany politics . 
  i knew those canadians were not that nice . 
   `` if there is no god , everything is permitted . '', 
  that quote comes from a person who did n't live in modern europe , but who saw raw human nature in gulags , where he spent some time . 
  so , no , atherism is n't making you attacking me , it 's your satisfied basic human needs . 
   i hope you 're not really saying that the only thing keeping you from murdering and robbing people is fear of some imaginary dude punishing you for it . 
  i am not saying that , i am saying what keeps you from doing that is that you have enough to cover your basic needs . 
  why would you attack someone and go to jail if you do n't have the need to take it ? 
  i am also not talking about an imaginary dude , but about god . 
  it is a diferent concept , but that 's a personal opinion and i respect that . 
  the acpeptance of an absolute authority is what developed laws . 
  in the judeo-christian and some other religious cultures we give our problems to god , and do n't solve them by ourselves . 
  that big idea if you want was transfered into what we call law and judges . 
  that way the circle of violence was stoped , because a higher authority decides .
