  ** edit : ** psychologist jordan peterson explains a similar concept in much better terms in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07ys4tqpris ) . 
   my neighbours are a polish-dutch married couple they have a simmilar culture like other euroeans . 
  there are also migrants from other countries who seem to assimilate pretty well because they share the wame work ethics and cultural views , like japanese , koreans or vietnamese for example . 
  they also look `` diferent '' from europeans , but i have never heard anyone complain about them . 
  if you take somalis or north africans for example , there are many reports . 
  when did you read in the news about dutch or american peolpe attacking someone in your country ? 
  i think european vallues should be more important in the eu and not simply `` universal vallues '' . 
  that 's what many voaters seem to miss in large mainstream political parties . 
  the gap will be replaced by the next dominant religion , since religion is in the human nature . 
  every human civilization or tribe had a form of religion . 
  we live now in special times where all our needs are satisfied , that 's why atheism is strong . 
  since there ca n't be always economical growth , there will be sooner or later a stagnation or deficit . 
  then the people will look again for hope and the divine , because the material goods are again out of reach . 
  since compromisses are harder to make if the ressources are less , humans need an ethical and moral code . 
  they will never find it in atheism :  `` if there is no god , everything is permitted . '', 
   \\ - fyodor dostoevsky maybe [ atheism is an intellectual luxury of the wealthy ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/24/atheism-richard-dawkins-challenge-beliefs-homeless ) . 
  let 's not turn debates into definition games , because that way topics get swiped under the rug . 
  you probably know what i mean . 
  by controled migration i mean that the states controll how many people should enter . 
  with the current circumstances it is not the case . 
  eu boats find illegal migrants on the sea and bring them to italy , spain or other member states . 
  where this leads you can see for example at the french uk border . 
  pretty weak if you ask me . 
  the pasivity of politicians towars problems like uncontroled migration and lack of inovation in the leading parties makes people lose their trust . 
  if the left does n't find answers , the right will keep becoming stronger . 
  self criticism is important , but mostly you see blaming the other side . 
  protests like this were not necessary a few years ago . 
  ah , when europe had an leitkultur . 
  people do n't know that the catholic church has always allowed that priests can get married ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_catholic_churches#clerical_celibacy ) ) . 
  it 's the eastern rite , but they are in full comunion with the vatican . 
  anyway , this is about deacons . 
  and muslim . 
  so much about the argument that every muslim attacking is terrorism . 
  what is keeping albania from legalization of weed ? 
  it would boost the tourism , since it 's so much cheaper than the netherlands , it has an actual mountain scenery and a coast with a great climate . 
  so many positive effects . 
  how is the view on roma people in poland ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtvr9haqwie ), 
  i am pretty sure you are troling , but albania was n't in ex-yu . 
  i see , you go for the tripple chance . 
  croats , serbs and muslims , all in one . 
  true , why would they own an axe . 
  place your bets : 1 . 
  bosnia and herzegovina 4 . 
  serbia 5 . 
  macedonia 6 . 
  montenegro ** edit : ** sorry guys , no refunds . 
  the most impressive part is that he was able to record it in . mov format . 
  [ zizek agrees ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdrhqnz9lo ), 
  kids these days jum on every new trend . 
  losethos still best os . 
  btw , there 's an interessting article [ about the programmer ] ( https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gods-lonely-programmer ), 
  ah , the balkan part of the alps . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/1nrrprol-uy ) should play when you enter the church . 
  the feel when you reaize 1000 was 1017 years ago . 
  females pick , men want to use every chance to pass their genes to the next generation . 
  it makes sense , because when a woman is pregnant , she ca n't defend herself , ca n't go hunting or is in danger to lose her unborn baby . 
  that 's why she needs to look for a partner who is fit enough to support her . 
  femles also need to be sure the partner stays with them and invests his energy for this task . 
  that 's why woman do n't jump on every oppurtunity . 
  well , there are definetly some , but in natural conditions , they would lose the evolution game . 
  men do n't have to be picky the best strategy is to make as many babies as possible . 
  some of them will survive even without them . 
  but if they want to be sure their genes are combined with other good genes , they will be ready to invesst more energy in a picky partner . 
  evolutional strategies made us who we are . 
  even the authentic emotions and thoughts serve the purpose to folllow the right behaviour pattern and pass our genes to the next generation . 
   i 'd trade it all to go back and have sex with paleolithic women . 
  i think it 's worth it . 
  i do n't know if that 's true . 
  i am personally for helping refugees , but i think countries that are culturaly and geographicaly closer do n't want to do more to help , even if they can . 
  take for example saudi arabia . 
  during the haj saudi arabia takes easily ~ 2.000.000 every year in special camps . 
  why not use it to give shelter to people fleeing from war ? 
  why did ' t they call them like germany did ? 
  no , at least not in the syrian case , there are other rich regions/countries that are closer , but refuse refugees . 
  take for example [ saudi arabia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrians_in_saudi_arabia#conflicting_versions ) :  saudi foreign ministry officials claim that the nation has received nearly 2.5 million syrians since 2011 . 
  [ 10 ] [ 11 ] however , the bbc reports that ** saudi arabia has let in 500,000 syrian refugees since 2011 , [ 12 ] while arab news reported that saudi arabia was already home to 500,000 syrians ** [ 13 ] saudi arabia claims to have granted 100,000 syrians residency . 
  an official from saudi arabia 's ministry of foreign affairs stated that saudi arabia `` made it a point not to deal with them as ` refugees ' . 
  '' [ 6 ] [ kuwait ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war#onward_migration_and_resettlement ) :  kuwait has an estimated ** 120,000 syrians ** . 
  more specifically , kuwait extends residency permits for syrian expatriates who have overstayed in kuwait . 
  or [ qatar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war )  ** 40,000 ** ( estimated overstays 2015 ) ** 42 ** ( registered ), 
  the best advice i got was `` if a woman wants to go , let her go '' . 
  i do n't buy the romantic bullshit about fighting for someones love . 
  it is fucking hard , more than that , and the realization comes after the pain gets less . 
  ** please note that everyone is diferent , and this may not be the case in your situation : ** the thing about not having time or whatever problem there is that keeps you from talking is only an excuse . 
  you can always make time for a phone call . 
  i am not saying people should make every day free time for those conversations , but if the motivation from one person becomes much less , it is just a matter of time when excuses will come . 
  do n't give up your self-respect to a person who is n't ready to invest the same effort in a relationship like you do , even if she believed when she said that she will always be with you . 
  all the things about `` not kissing '' and so on do n't matter . 
  if a person is ready to cheat once , she will do it again if the right situation comes . 
  i had shit like this happen to me and to a few friends . 
  i use the experience to recognize a more rational and honest person . 
  they exist , but i was only able to recognize it after the pain left for a bit . 
  what helped me was doing emotionaly intensive things , like sport and meeting new people , also deleting all memories ( they are only emotional barriers ) . 
  like i said , everyone is diferent and i do n't want you think i say it is the case in other peoples situation . 
  it is only my experience . 
  fuck emotional pain . 
  feel free to ask questions or tell me your thoughts if you need to talk . 
  i know , like the japanese minority in germany . 
  :( you are still moj brat,
