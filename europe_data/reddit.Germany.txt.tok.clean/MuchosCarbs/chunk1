[ here 's an article published just a couple of hours ago . 
  ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2017-04/kinderehen-verbot-aufhebung-kindeswohl-maedchen-als-objekte ) the author claims that putting the underage bride into a home for unattended minors and separating her from her husband would tear apart families and couples * just because they do n't conform to our norms * . 
  i reckon they tend to use their names . 
  right , sorry . 
  the focus on just germany was lost on me . 
  i checked the afd 's program : basically , they wan na reform the eu and if that 's impossible - according to their ideas - they seek to withdraw from it . 
  i did paparazzi that joke coming !, 
  i guess camilla was hungry ... 
  looks like the gender pay gap can finally be history !, 
  haha , no . 
  just joking . 
  everything is fine , i last for a long time , haha \\* * sweats nervously * \\*, 
   they offer 15mins . 
  so what do i do for the remaining 13 minutes ? 
  i ship it, 
  ah yes , all those sarin attacks and rpgs in nigeria or guinea - where the majority of migrants are currently coming from . 
  even if they are here , what makes you think they can contribute to society in any meaningfully positive way ? 
  they do n't have any qualifications and will forever be left behind by a fast moving society and culture that 's defined by performance . 
  i actually agree : the discussion about an upper limit seems pretty meaningless . 
   how exactly is `` everyone in europe '' suffering if germany continues to accept more refugees ? 
  because accepting more refugees/migrants ( the line is quite blurry at this point ) will act as a pull factor for others in africa . 
  eventually , we 'll have to force other member states to take them in if we ca n't stop their influx . 
  then you have freedom of movement in the eu which means terrorists can select targets at their leisure after being accepted in germany . 
  the budget surplus is in no way thanks to refugees . 
  they barely have jobs let alone contribute to our economy in a meaningful way . 
  we 're spending billions on their welfare instead of investing it in innovation or actual economic value . 
  well , not fully-fledged refugees per year anyway . 
  but the total number of people who came here and are n't deported - even if they were denied refugee status - is still staggering . 
  we actually had 441.899 new asylum * requests * in 2015 and 722.370 in 2016 . 
  in 2016 256.136 were accepted as refugees , 153.700 got subsidiary protection and 173.846 were denied , from a total of 695.733 asylum * decisions * that year . 
  in 2015 we had 282.726 total decisions , 137.136 being accepted as refugees , 1.707 got subsdiary protection and 91.514 were denied . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl-april-2017.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) note that most decisions in 2016 were probably from asylum seekers arriving in 2015 . 
  you 're probably right . 
  even an upper limit - if constitutional - of 200.000 - 300.000 would be pretty hefty , given that the vast majority will stay indefinitely and depend on welfare . 
   to qualify for family reunification you have to be able to support your family without welfare . 
  that 's not true . 
  privileged family reunification is available to accepted asylum seekers and subsidiary protected ones ( starting in march 2018 ) . 
  privileged means that they do n't have to be able to support their family without welfare or have to provide living space . 
  check the table on p. 75 which further subdivides the non-germans into ` zuwanderer ' . 
   stop throwing migrants and refugees together , there is a diffrence . 
  in theory : yes . 
  feel free to read the [ official german crime statistics for 2016 ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2017/pks-2016.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) . 
  refugees/migrants are over-represented in both violent crimes and sexual assault/rape . 
  once again , everyone in europe has to suffer under germany 's ( moral ) superiority complex . 
  well , a replacement is definitely happening in cities : if the foreigner population in some districts increases significantly , the native population usually leaves . 
  partly due to increased crime , partly because they do n't want to send their kids to schools where only a minority speaks the native language or where they are harassed for their ethnicity . 
  more like * clingy * , haha, 
  you 're right , sorry about that . 
  this is the full report : http://www.statewatch.org/news/2017/jul/unhcr-refugees-report.pdf, 
  ngos are inarguably acting as another pull factor : from the [ un report ] ( http://www.statewatch.org/news/2017/jul/unhcr-refugees-report.pdf ) on migration :  this shift has a direct effect on the costs borne by smugglers , who now buy less fuel , use cheaper , less seaworthy boats and no longer have to pay for a crew to be on board . 
  the significant reduction of upfront costs has made the smuggling business more accessible to many young libyans . 
  while i would n't outright put all the blame on ngos , they are n't exactly helping as much as they 'd like to think . 
  denmark 's most significant culinary achievement !, 
  scotland is like a little kid that just got a new toy : bringing it everywhere and trying to play with it all the time . 
  and in scotland 's case , the toy is a deep-fryer . 
  but why do they need us to solve them ? 
  we 've been pretty good at creating ** massive ** problems on our own soil in the past 100 years , but we 've recovered . 
  why are n't we observing the same sorts of development in africa ? 
  thanks , mom . 
  i do n't know much about humour , but i feel like this was an excessively long setup for a very mediocre punchline . 
  i prefer my jokes to be more ... efficient . 
  they are pretty good at genociding themselves even without western interference . 
  i know that guilt-tripping yourself over the evils of colonialism is on-vogue again in europe and the us , but post-colonial influences may or may not be as detrimental to a country 's development as you might like . 
  i think it 's a difficult cause-and-effect relationship : lack of development causes higher birthrates , higher birthrates cause resource-scarcity and millions of young , uneducated people have historically never been a motor for stability and prosperity . 
  i hate how this sounds , but i think we should definitely subsidize or enforce stricter birth rates . 
  we ca n't educate or improve their situation as fast as their demographics threatens both local and global stability . 
  having lots of kids was a guarantee for social care and income in the future : more kids , more can work , more make money , more can take care of you . 
  this happened in europe as well . 
  unfortunately , - as opposed to europe - africa has n't developed to where these birth rates are no longer necessary . 
  the naturally exponential growth combined with a scarcity of resources and an artificially low child mortality ( partially due to foreign aid ) has led to the current unsustainable demographic problems . 
   most of which have no perspective here and will indefinitely depend on welfare . 
   who determines this ? 
  their education is simply not sufficient enough for the majority of jobs available in germany . 
  with 2/3 of syrian refugees being barely able to read and write ( in their own language ) or solve simple math problems - and syrians are still among the better-educated refugees . 
  additionally , with automation on the rise , many of the jobs they may be qualified enough for right now will most likely be replaced in the future . 
   i might be wrong , but i was under the impression that terrorist attacks were in the majority carried out by native and 2nd/3rd generation german salafis . 
  not entirely . 
  in 2016 the attack in ansbach was executed by a syrian refugee , the one in berlin ( killing 12 ) by a tunisian refugee , the one in w\u00fcrzburg by a refugee claiming to be from afghanistan , the ones in essen and hannover were committed by 2nd/3rd gen native salafists/isis-sympathizers . 
  so 3/5 were refugees . 
   france , the uk , and belgium have most terrorist attacks committed by people already born there . 
  which is exactly my point : we now take them in as refugees ( like the manchester bomber 's parents ) and maybe just one generation later we have native radical ( ized ) terrorists . 
  how have you disproven my point ? 
  you said :  not quite mate . 
  we have much more right wing terror attacks . 
  i asked for numbers about ** terror attacks ** and you gave none . 
  the number of violent crimes motivated by right-wing extremist ideology is 1600 in 2016 , 1 murder . 
  the number of left-wing extremist violent crimes is 1.201 , 0 murders . 
  however , these are not terrorist attacks , there were 5 of those in germany in 2016 with 12 dead and countless injured . 
  all of them committed by islamic terrorists . 
  even if we count the right-wing terror attacks with no deaths - which we admittedly should - their number and impact is still dwarfed by islamic terrorism . 
  listen , i am not trivializing right - or left-wing extremism , but singling them out is ridiculous when comparing them to the scale and effect of islamic terrorism . 
  i should have clarified : every terror attack that killed people . 
   we have much more right wing terror attacks . 
  you can surely back-up that claim with numbers . 
  anyway , go ahead , ignore and trivialize any attacks committed by foreigners , because the local left - and right-wing extremists are the only true terrorists . 
  would be cool if we could just die out in peace . 
  alternatively : make it easier for men and women to reconcile career and family , work on an actual immigration and assimilation strategy or invest in cloning . 
  i ca n't believe you just said that . 
  you 've made an enemy for life !, 
  to be replaced by al-qaeda again ?
