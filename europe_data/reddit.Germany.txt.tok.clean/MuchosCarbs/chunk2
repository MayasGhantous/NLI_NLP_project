  by al-mourabitoun or maybe by ansar al-sharia in yemen , what about boko haram ? 
  will hamas escalate to the west , will hezbollah ? 
  maybe the 25,000 strong umbrella organization tehrik-i-taliban pakistan will send some over ? 
  can we expect sharia-police like chechen groups to keep terrorising gay men and women in berlin ? 
  should we just live with islamic schools and mosques preaching against befriending ` westerners ' and integration ? 
  should we just accept further surveillance laws to be abused in the future in the name of anti-terrorism ? 
  i disagree . 
  we 're still getting 200 000 asylum seekers per year , most of which have no perspective here and will indefinitely depend on welfare . 
  they are over-represented in crime and were responsible for every terror attack in germany in the past two years . 
  if france and the uk are any indication , then we will be targeted by even more extremist violence one or two generations from now . 
  sure as long as you are n't personally affected you do n't give a shit , but the crisis and it 's effects are far from over . 
   who knows what monsters get out after the sun sets . 
  australians, 
  when she started talking about potatoes she instantly became a 9.8 / 10 !, 
  oi m8 u avin a fokin giggle there m8 ? 
  ... into the even larger pool of isil sympathisers a few years from now . 
  i have been known to eat , yes . 
  rip garlic, 
  the number of deporations is also far lower than initially ` promised ' . 
  immigration is n't inherently bad , if done correctly . 
  i welcome any well-educated migrants who are willing and make a deliberate effort to integrate properly from whatever country . 
  i think canada and australia are countries with a solid immigration policy . 
   that 's the issue . 
  you germans are so brainwashed that even if everything you say and think screams `` i 'm anti-immigration '' , you do n't dare to say it loud even anonymously on the internet . 
  i do n't disagree . 
  you ca n't honestly believe that . 
  we 're going through so much trouble making sure that migrants and refugee stay here indefinitely , fast tracking any effort to give them citizenships and work . 
  the demographic changes in the past 2-3 years were pretty significant , to me at least . 
  i moved to a mid-sized city ( 100 000 inhabitants ) in 2011 and since 2016 i see more and more groups of african men hanging around near the train station and in parks , the main language on public transportation has seemingly become arabic and the number of fully veiled women pushing baby strollers has significantly increased . 
  sure , by some miracle these people may integrate into our society in the next 10-15 years , but how many more terrorist attacks do we have to endure until then ? 
  how many more cases of rape and sexual assault committed by foreigners ? 
  how many more laws restricting our personal freedom do we have to endure ? 
  and with ~ 200 000 asylum applications in 2017 and who knows how many more in the coming years , will it ever stop ? 
  i am not anti-immigration , but right now we are n't gaining anything from it : most will depend on welfare for the rest of their lives , building parallel societies in in less affluent parts of the cities . 
  parents are already avoiding schools with a large population of migrant kids ( for good reason ) , further dividing and seperating society . 
  you know what , maybe they were n't so bad after all !, 
  why not ? 
  butter up your butts !, 
  the ideal american body . 
  you may not like it , but this is what peak performance looks like . 
  huh , til . 
  congrats , your non-representative social circle consists of far , far , far left people . 
  are they by any chance mostly students ? 
  i think you fail to see the actual reason because your definition of ` average german ' seems significantly skewed . 
  apparently , ~ 40 % of voting germans ** are ** fine with cdu/csu because they ** do ** fit their political ideals . 
  looks like the disneyland version of a german-french border town ... 
  do n't forget a maraschino cherry on top ( to keep it authentic ) . 
  bone ape the teeth, 
  your flair makes it exceedingly difficult to determine whether or not you 're joking ... 
   conscious of their responsibility before god and man, 
  germany still get 's ~ 20 000 new asylum requests every month . 
  even though many seem to disagree , i think 200 000 new welfare recipients every year is still a lot ... 
   25.500 death toll in traffic such a shitty argument . 
  if there was an organization acting with the very public and deliberate goal of killing as many people in traffic accidents as possible , everyone would be up in arms trying to stop them - irregardless of their success rate , say compared to cancer . 
   by 2050 we will also have approx 1 million people living in mars . 
  i think the heat went to your head , mate . 
  sure : [ 2015 crime statistics ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2016/pks-2015.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) [ 2016 crime statistics ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2017/pks-2016.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  assuming a generous total of 1.5 million , they are 1.8 % of the population . 
  that 's definitely something i had n't considered , but checking the official police report suggests that it 's not the case . 
  see my reply [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ifx5n/europe_is_trying_to_teach_its_gender_norms_to/dj60l76/ ), 
  good question !, 
  the report already distinguishes between ` zuwanderer ' ( subsuming active asylum seekers , tolerated asylum seekers , civil war refugees and illegals ) and non-german perpetrators . 
  i checked 2015 's official crime statistics : 20 % of sexual offences were committed by non-germans , 4.8 % by ` zuwanderer ' [ p. 70 , table 9.1 - t05 ] ( https://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2016/pks-2015.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) . 
  i 'm not sure where the author found the 3.6 % . 
  genius : hire a bunch of desperate refugees , pay them minimum wage and turn it into a huge pr campaign about how generous and morally superior you are . 
   a report in february by germany 's federal criminal police , the bundeskriminalamt , showed that refugees were responsible for only 3.6 % of the sexual offences in germany in 2015 . 
  a very misleading choice of statistics . 
  if you look at last year 's report , 14.9 % of rape and severe sexual assault crimes were commited by ~ ~ migrants ~ ~ refugees . 
  5.5026222 e +57 \u00b0 is indeed very hot . 
   do you have any data about women not choosing engineering or is it just an assumption ? 
  women choosing engineering less often than men is a fact [ 1 ] , though the reasons behind it are more or less speculation . 
  social roles may be one of them , a ( biological ? ), 
  predisposition towards certain fields of work another . 
  [ 1 ] : i 've found some numbers about the uk [ here ] ( http://www.wes.org.uk/statistics ) . 
  some excerpts :  only 9 % of the engineering workforce is female . 
  and only 6 % of registered engineers and technicians ( i.e. 
  ceng , ieng , engtech ) are women . 
   the uk has the lowest percentage of female engineering professionals in europe , at less than 10 % , while latvia , bulgaria and cyprus lead with nearly 30 % . 
  and more extensive research [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/she-figures-2012_en.pdf ) :  however , that same year in the eu-27 , only 32 % of scientists and engineers were women . 
   on average in the eu-27 , women represented 40 % of all researchers in the higher education sector , 40 % in the government sector and 19 % in the business enterprise sector , but in all three sectors the number of female researchers has been witnessing higher growth rates than the number of male researchers . 
   or perhaps , it 's because of the fact that poorer people choose more practical/safe carrier choices . 
  this goes for people within a western nation , it probably goes worldwide . 
  i think i heard the same about india , were many women chose engineering jobs simply because they pay well and are in-demand . 
  women in richer countries ( i think sweden in particular was mentioned ) pick less well-paid , but more social ( education , etc. ), 
  instead . 
  i guess considering the quality of your cheeses , you are just more familiar working with tough , inedible round objects ... 
  does the article clarify if these mutilations were performed in sweden ? 
  bringing pain to the common people since 3000 bc, 
   and they obviously have problems with accepting our way of life well , that 's putting it mildly ... 
  it 's tanks , is n't it ? 
   works as a london bus driver well then . 
   why do they speak german in austria ? 
  they do ?
