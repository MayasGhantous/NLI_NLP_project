oettinger ... 
  he 's a useful puppet . 
  this man is so incompetent that my brain hurts when he speaks . 
  ouch that was a low blow . 
  oh thanks i would say the same thing about you . 
  but let 's make it quick and let me be honest . 
  i 'm not interested in a debate with you . 
  so you are free to feel as the winner . 
  i do n't care have a nice day . 
  when people say nato they mean usa . 
  assad is a important ally of iran . 
  that is the only reason why they helped the rebels in the first place and the same goes for saudi arabia . 
  it was a plan b if the atom negotiations with iran would had failed and shit would get serious aka invasion of iran . 
  lol its not like the refugees there do n't destroy the whole economy . 
  and they are the same people ? 
  with that logic i could say that poland and germany are the same or germany and france . 
  they all are christian countrys right ? 
  but the reality is n't so simple . 
  societies and their culture are a little more than a shared religion . 
  i would change your tone before a mods sees your post and decide to delete it . 
  i do n't know if you are really just new here or just pretend to be . 
  fact is that we have many sock-puppet accounts since the cologne crimes and brigades who upvote certain topics and downvote everything else . 
  you just seems to fit in . 
  like i said maybe i 'm wrong and you can call me out for my bullshit but you should read the rules about insults . 
  whatever have a nice day, 
  honest question do you have any idea what the changes of the constellation court in poland are ? 
  or are just a troll who tries to change the subject back to the refugee crisis ? 
  ha me too but we underestimate the arrogance and stupidness of people with power . 
  it seems it was mostly the work of malu dreyer ( spd ) . 
  but look our free press instantly reported about this . 
  do you think the circle jerk gives a shit ? 
  nope it does n't fit the narrative that the arrogant german media is completely censored and lies , 
  at least it would be nice that you do n't can instantly post articles with an 4 days old account . 
  everyone can write what they want but i can call out bullshit if i think i see it . 
  so as you can call me out for my comment . 
   its not a secret that / r/europe has a problem with brigades from certain groups . 
  i saw here so many angry accounts who were deleted after a short time . 
  you can call me paranoid if you want but i have become more skeptic :3, 
  probably the people who just are glad that they are safe now and the people who actually hope to live here forever . 
  i think we all know that most of these people are n't refugees who are in danger . 
  they just hope that they can work here and have a future . 
  i do n't judge them for that ( i would probably do the same when my country has nothing for me ) but they have no future here . 
  the problem is that their nations do n't take them back . 
  thats the real problem here . 
  how can we enforce that ? 
  i 'm seriously hope for suggestions from you guys . 
  i 'm not an expert in international diplomacy ... 
  well people want to freak out . 
  do n't dare to interrupt the circle jerk about the arrogant germans  edit : i realize that i way to often use `` well '' -_-, 
  oh sure we will outcry when our government tries to change our constitutional court :3, 
  you know all what i have to do is to look at your comment history and i know that you are probably just a sock-puppet account who is pushing an agenda . 
  ** i mean hey everyone just look at the comment history and how old this account is . 
  only posts on / r/europe and maybe 2 in / r/de . . nothing else ** but hey everyone can think for himself . 
  maybe i 'm wrong . . but i pretty sure i 'm not . 
  well `` die linke '' is the successor of the pds ( which was the successor of the [ sed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_unity_party_of_germany ) ) and the wasg . 
  they even have a communist wing in the party . 
  so they pretty far far left and friendly to russia , 
  i read this today somewhere else and i support this to 100 % even when the situation is a little over the top . 
  this behavior ( that from the daycares ) is ridicules . 
  its not that the refugee/immigrants demand such bullshit . 
  such things just make the people even more hostile and that only because some idiots thought that muslims are bigots who ca n't accept pork in the same building . 
  who are the racists here ? 
  and yet there are ** big ** news outlets who are n't full of `` leftist propaganda '' [ faz ] ( http://www.faz.net/ ) [ welt ] ( http://www.welt.de/ ) [ focus ] ( http://www.focus.de/ ) [ handelsblatt ] ( https://www.handelsblatt.com/ ) and there are many local ones like the [ stuttgarter zeitung ] ( http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/ ) . 
  you will not find any leftist agenda there . 
  so do n't tell me that there is a conspiracy of the left washed media about the refugee crisis . 
  these big outlets where always skeptic and criticized the government . 
  they started as a anti- $ liberal/conservative party . 
  but they got overrun by racists and nutjobs . 
  [ they stripped their founder from the leadership last year and humiliated him , because he was to mainstream for these nutjobs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernd_lucke ) today ? 
  imagine a ukip full of racists and angry trump voters who hate america and love putin . 
  / r/putindidnothingwrong they also have hardcore christians in the eu parliament . 
  i find it quit funny that pis did n't refused to talk with this people . 
  they were against sanctions for russia and gave a shit about the worries of the eastern europeans . 
  ah come on . 
  maybe 50 % ( if i want to be positive ) of the people here reading the article . 
  the rest just complains on basis of the headline . 
  we complain about the lack of objective journalism but posting click bait articles with offending headlines ... of course only if it fits our selective opinion and narrative . 
  i mean how often i see here articles from the guardian and the telegraph ? 
  both are piss poor click bait outlets . 
  one is for the left and the other is for the right wing . 
  both are awful . 
  ah so you say that bild is a puppet for american propaganda ? 
  you know how often i heard this argument in the ukraine crisis from russia apologists ? 
  `` the l\u00fcgenpresse is telling lies about russia and do n't want to tell the truth about the junta in the ukraine . 
  it 's all a complot from america ! '', 
  here is a thing : use wikipedia for `` l\u00fcgenpresse '' and if you do n't speak german use google translate . 
  you are right that it was rarely used before the nazis . 
  but it was the nazi party who made this word `` mainstream '' . 
  it does n't helped either that putinbots used this word for their propaganda . 
  the earliest articles are from 4.01 after the weekend . 
  i do n't say that his is immediately but neither a big delay . 
  the police did a horrible job and do n't ordered help ( the police chef lost his job for this ) . 
  so i think its save to say that the whole situation was chaotic and we had n't a picture how big this thing was . 
  after that more and more people reported there experience and we got the whole picture of this crime . 
  i would n't say that the press was trying to protect rapists . 
  but the cologne police did a horrible horrible job and lost a lot of trust with this incompetent management . 
  lol of course you guys know the truth . 
  the same shit was said in the ukraine crisis . 
  the evil l\u00fcgenpresse was lying about russia . 
  putin just wanted to defend himself against the evil nato and the crimea belonged to russia .
