  so everything was ok . 
  the east europeans where just hypocrites for their worries ... after a certain time you see through this bullshit . 
  the arguments are always the same from you guys . 
  but hey you can write whatever you want . 
  i do n't antagonize anyone personally . 
  its just a fact that the word `` l\u00fcgenpresse '' was mostly used by the nazi party . 
  [ here is a article from the atlantic ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/01/the-worst-german-word-of-the-year/384493/ ) regardless how much some people here are writing that people in germany are ** afraid ** to say the truth and that you ca n't criticize the refugee crisis . . its just bullshit on reddit from anonymous people . 
  pegida is big in one city . . dresden . 
  their `` leader '' was in prison , before that he tried to escape to south africa . . 
  he found it funny to dress up as hitler . 
  nowhere else is pegida a thing . 
  they fear the evil muslims but their state has only 3 - 3,5 % foreigners . 
  in leipzig 's `` legida '' do n't even try anymore to cover up their racism . 
  they had a `` party '' , last week , in the inner city . 
  trashed many local stores . 
  it 's just that this does n't fit the `` german media is censoring and lying '' narrative here in / r/europe and many people ca n't deal with that . 
  if i learned one thing in / r/europe than that people do n't like different opinions and use the `` boo ! '', 
  button , regardless of the arguments . 
  i mean even the mods say that many people here are acting childish . 
  to be fair that is reddit in a nutshell . 
  td ; lr there is bias in the state owned media but there is no censoring in the free press . 
  we have big left wing and right wing newspapers and the majority is not happy with the refugee crisis but not to such an extent as certain people here try to imply . 
  well the nazis invented the word to dismiss their critics . . you know before they had enough power to kill their critics  not the best idea to use this word . 
  another funny thing ... most of the time its the extreme right wing who screams l\u00fcgenpresse . 
  even when many people have some concerns they do n't use this word . 
  its not like every newspaper is left . 
  welt , bild and faz are big newspapers and more right wing / conservative . 
  but i suppose for some vocal `` worried citizen '' even these are `` lefties '' and part of an evil conspiracy against the german people . 
  i wonder how many butt hurt downvotes i will get for that :d, 
  most people give a shit about the state news . 
  its the about the changes of the constitutional court and some of the statements from pis members . 
  and at last : the media goes always over the top , regardless which country and topic . 
  the same over the top was the cologne crimes . 
  barley any new infos but regardless thousands of articles , each day , who said nothing new or the ukraine crisis as an example . 
  we even had an article about putins breakfast at that time . . yup . 
  its all about click bait . 
  til : i could n't survive in sweden . 
  of course you 're right in terms of pure economic . 
  but i meant it more in terms of international and geographical politics . 
  most of the time the eu barley speaks with one voice . 
  i really think that america has now more concerns with its new and old alleys against chinas influence . 
  best example would be vietnam . 
  once enemies but now alleys , because both fear chinas influence in the region . 
  hope that made my statement more clear , 
  haha do n't worry i 'm not a putin fan  just a realist . 
   `` america has no permanent friends or enemies , only interests '' ** - henry kissinger ** that is true for all nations . 
  that is the reason why the eu is so important for us . 
  without it the big ones would play us against each other in negotiations . 
  the eu is far far far from being perfect but it is n't a total failure like some people say . 
  oh are we going full circle jerk again in / r/europe ? 
  germany : `` but we have coffee and cake here ... well than lets hang out another time ? 
  did you guys have my number ? 
  cool ... '' * forever alone *, 
  of course the us are n't happy . 
  china is their biggest rival . 
  its in their best interest to bind us to them . 
  its not like they put our best interest above theirs . 
  look at the syria war and the refugee crisis . 
  europe is n't that important anymore , the cold war is over and russia is n't a threat for the usa anymore . 
  china on the over hand ... 
  only if you change one of your providers . 
  but i would stick with the telekom . 
  vodafone sucks and the rest is even worse . 
  not really . 
  you do n't get downvoted into oblivion for a pro brexit opinion and there are clearly people who support this view with upvotes . 
  its just that the majority does n't share your opinion . 
  but thats not an echo chamber so please do n't use `` our viewpoint get silenced '' card . 
  join us !, 
  actually in my actual civ 5 game is a little different ... poland invades my great holy jewish kaisereich !, 
  you ca n't trust casimir iii , he 's a snake !, 
  you know sometimes things just happens ... 
  like give their kids playmobil instead of lego ... oh wait my parents did that :o, 
  that made my day . 
  :d thank you for the giggles . 
  ps : lego becomes more and more expansive !, 
  i wanted to buy star wars lego for my nieces for her birthday . 
  i 'm not made of money man !, 
  ok this sounds rude but your two party system really sucks . 
  sorry i know i sound arrogant smart ass but for gods sake ... its either david cameron or this guy ? 
  was n't there the hope that the liberals change voting system for more party diversity ? 
  is the party already death ? 
  * edit : hear was once a attempt to be funny but after a second thought it was really awful . 
  first of all ... 
  i have nothing against tea . 
  some of my best friends drink tea . 
  i 'm a tolerant person but your faith is wrong and therefore invalid . 
  [ we know that coffee is the one true god ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/unanything/images/5/57/coffee_is_god.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140312005619 ) and if you do n't like that than leave !, 
  i always thought about a union with france , netherlands . 
  germany and poland + english as the second national language and a single army ( poles would love that right ? 
  ( if we dream about impossible things : i also want a unicorn with laser eyes ! ) ... 
  but i did n't know , at that time , that so many poles dislike us as state . 
  france is already to proud to learn proper english :p i do n't know about the netherlands . 
  but there is one big problem . 
  i think germany is to strong and everyone would fear that we over vote them for our own sake . 
  ( to be fair that ** could ** happen sometimes ) . 
  on the other hand i do n't think that we get any further with the eu . 
  there to many different actors . 
  i also see no future without the eu . 
  i bet china , russia and the us would love that . 
  we would easily become everyones bitch .
