  i just pointed out that he is using a extreme language and that i find his viewpoint about these specific `` more refugees '' minority pretty extreme . 
  do n't disrupt the narrative !, 
  nobody likes facts when they are not fit in the preferred opinion . 
  did i call you a racist ? 
  wow you should read more and rage less . 
  declaring that people are insane and that they are a threat because of their opinion ( regardless how stupid it is ) is extreme language . 
  if you think that makes you a racists than should you ask yourself why do you think that . 
  i did n't call you that , so do n't try to put words into my mouth . 
  they are neo nazis . 
  they do n't need a reason , it 's just that they now are trying to justify their actions . 
  i mean here , there i live , they had send ** fake ** `` official '' mails from our government to older people which stated that they lose their home because the places would be used for refugees . 
  they do everything to create outrage . 
  well not really they have a different ( stupid ) opinion . 
  but your extreme response ( danger to us all , because they have a different opinion wtf ? ), 
  says that your mindset is pretty extreme too . 
  well more like you will live in a putin / erdogan `` democracy '' with a rich elite and the poor rest of society . 
  thats the thing with corrupt governments ... they fucking up the country for their personal gains regardless which political agenda they may have . 
  you forgot the / s i was in cologne when hooligans against salafists `` demonstrated '' . 
  did you read the article ? 
  i have my doubts ... 
  i would read the article before i write an angry comment . 
  seriously you can tell that many people saw the headline and flipped out . 
  you mean a echo chamber like / r/europe ? 
  the people here losing their shit about this stuff and different opinions are downvoted . 
  i saw people who want border controls and fences for every country ( fuck schengen our safety is more important !!! ) . 
  people declared refuges as `` the enemy '' . 
  na this subreddit is total `` objective '' . 
  to everyone who 's reading this . 
  do n't act as if your shit does n't stink . 
  this sub is n't better than any other echo chamber . 
  give us facts . 
  where is your source ? 
  seriously educate yourself in history . 
  one big reason he and his party became popular was the finance crisis , who destroyed the economy , after the land suffered already from the [ treaty of versailles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_versailles ) that and democracy was a new and young thing in europe . 
  even the us did n't care that much , they thought nothing big would change with a dictatorship in terms of diplomacy . 
  i know that you mean but there is another reason . 
  almost everyday people attacking a refuge home . 
  i mean look do you think i 'm happy with our refugee policy and this situation at all ? 
  the whole situation is shit . 
  and yet i have to defend refuges against people who now scream `` they all are a threat to our society and if our government does nothing somebody has to do ! '', 
  the whole `` refugees welcome '' is a counter movement ( born from the shock ) to the radical right . 
  if this people had n't cast fire on refugee homes and shocked people , we had a less emotional and more rational debate . 
  and because i helped out in a refugee home and know some refuges i ca n't generalize `` they all criminals and are n't compatible with our culture . '', 
  this means not that i 'm `` nothing wrong its all easy we need more refugees '' it is this stupid generalization from the `` left '' and the `` right '' . 
  nothing is only black and white but the extremists on both sides dominate the debate . 
  people here probably think that i 'm a lefties only because i disagree with some statements and declaring all my points as invalid . 
  its so fucking stupid . 
  i just do n't like generalization , labeling and some of the racists comments i read here . 
  the debate is to emotional . 
  but lets not forget that they are n't immigrants . 
  thats the point . 
  they have to leave when their homeland is some sort of stable . 
  to make syria stable ... 
  i really do n't believe that we can destroy isis without troops . 
  so you may know the root cause ? 
  tell me please . 
  it 's not that i agree with the article but it seems that you know the answer . 
  yeah i got pretty [ `` downvoted '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zvm66/more_complaints_of_mass_sexual_assault_on_new/cypfpov ) yesterday for saying `` we should n't dehumanize this people '' . 
  people just love to rage and generalize, 
  i 'm not happy with this situation too but i do n't declare refuge as `` enemies because of their culture '' it would help us all when people would stop to generalize everything to an extreme . 
  regardless if it the left or the right , everything is only black and white for some idiots and because of that we ca n't have a serious debate . 
  my problem with this guy ? 
  i think he 's a troll . 
  his whole history is just rambling against refugees around the world and nothing else . 
  well you had me to this point : `` never ending stream of attacks by refugees ? '', 
  and you should rage less and read more carefully . 
  the redditor said `` build a fence at the border , only let people with passport in , send those back to ** austria ** '', 
  let 's hope . 
  this could end really bad . 
  strong support for russia ? 
  we do n't have anything against russians but i dare to say that the vast majority does n't trust the actual russian government . 
  i looked at your post history and its clear that you are on a crusade against refuges around the world . 
  maybe your are a troll , maybe not . 
  i use my right to be a ignorant asshole and will ignore you . 
  have a nice day . 
  so you think border controls and a fence are the solution ? 
  that would be the end of schengen . 
  how big would be the damage for our economy ? 
  should every state build a fence ala `` everyone for himself ? '', 
  would this stop the constant stream of people ? 
  what do you want to do ? 
  shoot at them on sight ? 
  and do you think after all the shit this people have gone they are relaxed ? 
  how many people die on the way to europe ? 
  do you know how bad some of these refugee asylums are ? 
  some do n't even have a tv . 
  some of this people have to wait years before they get a yes or no . 
  every day could be your last in this land . 
  they are not to allowed to work . 
  they have to share the room with 6-8 random strangers and no privacy . 
  of course there can be fights . 
  there is no easy solution . 
  one thing would be to stabilize syria but omg we would have to use our troops ... nah not our problem . 
  its not like we are responsible for this shit ... oh wait yes we are responsible . 
  well mostly `` war on terror '' / `` arabic spring '' america and our oil friend saudi arabia . 
  nope its not . 
  some of them have the same bias against the west like you have a strong bias against them . 
  by the way not everyone is muslim . 
  there other ethnics who had flee ... and muslims who believed in the wrong brand of islam . 
  i meet some of this people and all that they want is a quiet peaceful life .
