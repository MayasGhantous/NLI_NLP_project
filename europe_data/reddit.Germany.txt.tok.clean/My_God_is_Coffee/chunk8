  he 's born in germany and pretty based like many other muslims i know . 
  i have read the `` article '' . 
  the headline is clickbait . 
  one single quoted concern after the coup . 
  but the article mentioned that the syrian press says that the coup was a conspiracy . . 
  they mentioned this `` important '' information 2 times in the article !, 
  seriously the more i read it , the more i see `` the independent '' as pure blog spam ... 
  i see nothing in the german press so far . 
  only the british press . . and i think that they are far from quality journalism . 
  well if they establish order . . no . 
  but what if we get a civil war in the turkey ? 
  that could get really really bad ... 
  fuck off my neighbor is muslim ( like many others here ) and a good friend of mine . 
  well op is posting a lot in / r/the _ donald . 
  that alone means nothing but i would n't be surprised if / r/europe gets brigaded ... again . 
  i will probably get downvotes for that but that 's my opinion , 
  that 's ( probably ) not the opinion of op . 
  it 's the article . 
  i asked him to post it in the comments because the site wants to register my e-mail address before i could read it . 
  ca n't read the article . 
  washington post wants to have my e-mail addresses . 
  op could you post the article in the comments ? 
  do n't come here with reason . 
  of course the police just used all the recourses to bully normal people who just do n't like the new female ( shitty ) ghostbuster movie while our streets are filled with criminals !, 
  i think it 's more a love-hate relationship  austria is a tsundere and the word `` piefke '' is their version of `` baka '' :p, 
  [ here 's a good article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/putin-wages-hybrid-war-on-germany-and-west-a-1075483.html ), 
  i would argue that a aggression need a un mandate . 
  in cases like another genocide against a minority . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  is this some sort of prank ? 
  maybe she just wants to humiliate johnson ? 
  but wtf ... 
  ah thanks for the clarification . 
   i just knew that british debates are a little `` meaner '' compared to ours . 
  we probably disagree here . 
  politic is n't entertainment . 
  that 's the way of populism . 
  look at nigel farage . 
  he 's charismatic and when i was younger ( and dumber ) i found his eu speeches pretty entertaining . 
  but it 's not the job of politicians to entertain me . 
  it 's their job to manage and maintain the country . 
  guttenberg was also entertaining ... 
  the yellow press loved him and his wife and we know now that he was a fraud . 
  i 'm glad that he did n't had the chance to become our next chancellor ... 
  i rather like to have a boring parliament with common sense than the current house of commons and westminister , 
  says the guy who posts on / r/the _ donald . 
  oh sweet irony :d, 
  oh thats the same as pegida and islam ... how many muslims live in east germany ? 
  not that much ... 
  so the only muslims they know about are the radical nutjobs ( like the salafist movement ) . 
  my neighbor is a muslim and he 's pretty normal . 
  he even do n't hate gays !, 
  wow that 's low down !, 
  f\u00e9licitations ! ... 
  i 'm so salty right now ... . 
  unemployment . 
  more and more jobs will be replaced by technology . 
  look at the automated car . 
  in 10 - 15 years there will probably no truck/taxi/uber drivers . 
  high educated jobs will be lower paid ( more potential employees = lesser wages ) . 
  i think our world view will change in the future . 
  i do n't know how it will change but i do n't think that there will be enough jobs for the whole society . 
  bismarck is ok but i hope we will see another leader in civ 6 . 
  civ was never total accurate with its leaders so maybe we could see frederick 2 again ? 
  ( king of prussia ), 
  but i wonder how long it would take before pedgida would turn against all this criminal east europeans . .  `` damn this bulgarians !, 
  they come over our border and bring nothing but trouble . 
  criminals that 's what they are !, 
  stealing our jobs and leech on our welfare system !, 
  what ? ... 
  well yeah we worked together ...   but that was in the past and has nothing to do with the actual problems ! '', 
   she claimed that 1,000 migrants cross the border illegally each day . 
  however she admitted the patrol had not found any on the day she joined it . 
  yup ...  `` the most popular brand among the invaders on their robbery and rape campaign is red bull , '' she claimed bizarrely . 
  this people are dangerous . 
  who knows if they have already murdered some of these `` invaders '' ... edit : offtopic i see that this was also posted on a sub called / r/europeanpeople . 
  and i thought / r/european migrated to another platform ... 
  i wish it was ... 
  thanks reported the post . 
  no love for karma whores . 
  if trump leaves the nato . . 
  there will be party time in east europe . 
  all these clay on the russian border ... , 
  it 's another protest vote against the establishment . 
  thats the problem with the voting system in the uk and usa . 
  most of the time there are nearly zero chances for third parties . 
  nothing will change and people are sick of both parties . 
  that 's the reason why trump is so popular ( and i guess this frustration played also a part in the brexit ) . 
  i have no idea what he would do as president ... at first i thought the worst case would be a troll for the next 4 years but now i 'm more concerned about the damage he could case for the rest of the world ... 
  the main problem is that the uk uses a [ plurality/majority vote system ] ( https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/beginnningreading/plurality.htm ) . 
  same shit as it is in the usa ( and poland but i could be wrong here ) . 
  countless people are sick of both established parties but there is nearly zero chance for a third party and a hope for change . 
  there is only room for black and white , `` us vs them '' or `` vote the lesser evil '' and no compromise at all . 
  but this does n't represent a plural society . 
  people have more than 2 world views . 
  [ proportional representation ] ( https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/beginnningreading/prsystems.htm ) is the better ( and fairer ) system . 
  it can be a problem if too many parties are on the table but for that we have vote % quotes . 
  ( in germany you need at least 5 % of the votes to get into the bundestag ), 
  well i checked again my statement was flawed . 
  the maghreb ( nord africa ) states are [ now ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/migrants-back-to-the-maghreb/a-19086195 ) declared as secure countries ( no chance of asylum at all ) .
