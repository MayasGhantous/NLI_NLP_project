is this a threat against other countries or against the russian people ? 
  well , you do n't want to know whats they put into these 2 $ kebabs then . 
  is there a city in the eu where its not safe to drink tap water ? 
  in southern countries , the water sometimes tasted of chlorine , but it was always fine to drink . 
  to answer the question : im from north rhine-westphalia , germany and tap water is perfectly safe here , its cleaner than bottled water . 
  wrong thread , we are talking about conspiracy theories here . 
  everybody knows that it doesnt exist . 
  i love my country because : present . 
  i hate my country because : past, 
  so the eurozone can control the pound and every other eu non-euro currency ? 
  nice to know . 
  thats stupid ... everybody knows that beer is bread in liquid form, 
  i do n't know if ops numbers are right , but they look like they could be plausible for me . 
  please do n't forget that the stupid people are always the ones you see and hear the most . 
  without being an immigrant/muslim i have lots of immigrant friends and most of them are n't different from everyone else . 
  they are liberal , tolerant and are n't that religious . 
  they are living in germany for more than 3 generations now . 
  sure , you can also find the ` bad ones ' , but they arent the majority . 
  they are just more visible . 
  edit : the article says that 60 % of the more liberal muslims are supporting gay marriage . 
  for the really religious muslims its only 40 % . 
  in turkey its only 12 % . 
  not true . 
  http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/27/uk-germany-gays-idukbre91q0nt20130227 74 % supporting gay marriage in 2013 . 
  i ca n't find a source for this , but i heard about a newer poll from this year where there was over 80 % voting for allowing gay people to marry, 
  just come to us , we are always ready to host another one ,

  [ in front of the embassy in berlin ] ( http://imgur.com/ssfdxld ), 
  norway is n't a member of the eu, 
  sure , but we were talking about the science founding here . 
  in 2014 , the net contribution of the uk to the entire eu budget was [ about 4.7 mrd . 
  euro ] ( http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/lightbox/published/231/images/thumb.jpg ) . 
  thats not too much and should be doable by the rest of the eu . 
  ( for reference : germanys budget surplus last year was over 12 mrd . 
  euro . 
  and the gdp of the eu without uk would still be [ over 14 trillion euro ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\\ ( gdp + of + eu \\ ) + - + \\ ( gdp + of + uk \\ ) + in + euro ) . ), 
  personally , i do n't think that the other countries will have to pay the whole funding gap . 
  there were already budget cuts in the past . 
  less funding for science projects , but also less universities/scientists/scientific projects . 
  it evens itself out . 
  also , someone here wrote that the uk gets more funding for science projects than it is paying into the system , so without the uk , there would actually be more money for the other countries . 
  i couldnt find a source for this so far but it sounds plausible . 
  edit : [ found a source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4tpjuc/uk_scientists_speak_about_brexit_pain_just_weeks/ ), 
  there are some parts of the basic law that cant be changed and i thought the law that forbids attacking other countries was one of them . 
  i just read that i was wrong and this is not the case . 
  it could be changed . 
  however , to change the grundgesetz you need a 2/3 majority in both chambers and i dont see that happening , especially not with a law that has the intention to make attacking other countries easier . 
  sounds like a good and interesting idea that could become complicated pretty quickly . 
  but it could work . 
  also with our basic law , even only paying for equipment that is used in an attack on foreign soil could be illegal . 
  so every country uses its own army under its own flag and works together with other countries that are fighting in the same operation ? 
  whats the difference to how things are working now ? 
  you dont need a majority if only the armies of the countries that voted yes are affected/involved . 
  there would be riots here if the eu parliament forces german soldiers to fight in something like the iraq war . 
  im for it but i dont see it happening anytime soon . 
  the differences ( culture , foreign policies , laws , ideologies ) between the countries are still way to big for it . 
  what channel are you talking about ? 
  i watched bbc , ntv and n24 and they reported the whole day about it , talked with their local correspondent about it , etc. 
  the first message on that screenshot is about the live coverage of n24 . 
  right now , it 's on the top of sueddeutsche.de and zeit.de , two of the biggest and most important newspapers in germany . 
  thats not true , every newschannel reported about it and it was on the frontpage of every news page . 
  my lockscreen was full with it : http://imgur.com/a/t0zbv it 's still on the second position on google news 1 day after the incident happened . 
   the eu does n't help itself here though , as even as a remainer i have concerns about allowing anyone to move any where they like without an ability to support themselves via employment . 
  not sure how it is in the uk but you have to live in germany for at least 5 years and pay into the social security system to get unemployment benefits for example . 
  you ca n't just move here and get money . 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens%e2%80%99_rights_directive  to be fully covered by the european right of free movement , the eea citizen needs to exercise one of the four treaty rights :  working as an employee ( this includes looking for work for a reasonable amount of time ) ,    working as a self-employed person ,   studying ,   being self-sufficient or retired . 
  [ . . ]  as long as a citizen has sufficient money or income not to rely on public funds and holds comprehensive health insurance , he/she exercises one or more treaty rights . 
  if no treaty right is exercised , the right of free movement is limited to three months . 
  because them not beeing patient is exactly what erdogan is trying to achieve . 
  he wants pictures of europeans ` fighting ' turkey in the media . 
  as long as it looks like it could be against the turkish people , it does n't really matter who does what exactly . 
  with a common enemy , its easier to get votes for a referendum that is supposed to ` make turkey strong ' . 
  same-sex marriage has an 83 % approval rate in germany at the moment . 
  problem is that our goverment is lead by a conservative christian party . 
  and there are working together with the csu , which is even more conservative and christian . 
  merkel is actually on the left side of the cdu and even she is slightly against it . 
  it 's also not that big of a problem since we have civil unions . 
  as far as i know , the only difference to an official marriage is that they are n't allowed to adopt kids . 
  allowing gay marriage and them adopting kids would still be the right thing to do . 
  brexit is more like the 3rd best player ragequitting and leaving more loot for the others, 
   but srlsy , please , we cane trade him for any other eu politician anyone can give us . 
  i 'm all for exchanging him with nigel farage . 
  i 'll just have to buy more popcorn beforehand . 
  how much support does the pis get from the polish people ? 
  is it likely that they would win the next election ? 
  the trump effect, 
  which border exactly ? 
  you know that the person we are talking about is french and was born and radicalized in france ? 
  so french people should n't be allowed to come to belgium ? 
  eus plan to create a joint army http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/06/europe-forges-ahead-with-plans-for-eu-army/, 
  then tell me what his impact on this is . 
  european countries are openly talking about creating an eu army now . 
  this happens because the country that blocked this idea the whole time decided to leave the eu . 
  of course , the thought that we maybe ca n't trust the us as an ally in the future also helped a bit , but having a joint eu army is not a new idea . 
  also , the target behind this is not to pay more money . 
  the plan is to archive more with the same budget or to save money , because of economy of scale . 
  edit to answer the stuff you added after i wrote this : europe is already able to defend itself . 
  just add up all european countries in this table here http://www.businessinsider.de/35-most-powerful-militaries-in-the-world-2014-7?r=us&amp;ir=t and you see that we have a bigger budget , more soldiers and more equipment than russia . 
  also , the majority of our equipment is developed and produced here in europe . 
  some countries are using american aircrafts but other than that , it 's largely european weapon systems .
