ah yes , 1491 . 
  good times . 
  did they argue in favor of censorship ? 
  if not , lets not judge them by association , but on the things they actually do and advocate for . 
  are you seriously complaining that you ca n't be anti-immigration on / r/europe ? 
  there is literally nothing else in this sub . 
  you people have the worst persecution complex , it 's not even funny anymore . 
  i agree , 40 % is way too much and we should take measures to reduce that number . 
  i 'm not so much in favor of this particular system as i am strongly in favor of a united european response . 
  quotas are a part of this , but so are strong borders , european financed camps in the border states and quick deportations for purely economic migrants whos asylum applications have been denied . 
  i 'm also very frustrated by the large amount of disinformation perpetuated by both sides . 
  it makes any honest debate almost impossible . 
  it is imo a greater threat to the eu than the crisis is . 
   let us not forget that only 20 % or so of the migratory population seem to be legitimate refugees fleeing war again with the ridiculous chinese whispers bs . 
  another iteration and it will be `` did you know that only 20 % of migrants are humans ? 
  the rest are dogs in trench coats . '', 
  21 % are ** syrian ** . 
  countries with a very high rate of asylum granted include syria , iraq , afghanistan and eritrea . 
  those people make up over 60 % . 
  weeeelll , this is embarrassing . 
  i read it in some german newspaper , but since you asked , i went right to the source , [ this q&a on emergency relocation ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-15-5698_en.htm ) and it turns out i was wrong . 
  what it calls for is the relocation of '' ** 120,000 people in clear need of international protection ** '' and '' ** applies to nationalities of applicants with an eu-wide average recognition rate of 75 % or higher ** '' , but it seems that they will not have been granted asylum yet . 
  now i feel really dumb . 
  i 'll correct my post . 
    i would n't be complaining if it suited my agenda how is this an argument ? 
  you do n't know how i react to bullshit that does `` fit my agenda '' 2 . 
  even if i do only call out bullshit that does n't fit my agenda , that does n't change the fact that it 's bullshit . 
  the fact that nobody from * your * side is calling this ridiculous post out is even more troubling than the post itself . 
   also :   q & amp ; a of european commission is that supposed to be a source ? 
  because that only leads me to [ this ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-15-5698_en.htm ) , which does n't have the quote or anything resembling it . 
  so that 's the new standard to get worked up over ? 
  a self post by some random redditor without any sources or context ? 
  why has this not been removed ? 
   2.1 info-graphics , images , selfs posts and other similar content which makes ( an ) assertion ( s ) but lacks ( a ) source ( s ) will be removed . 
  `` literally hitler '' merkel and `` the messiah '' orban propose the same thing ? 
  this is going to be an interesting comment section . 
  \\* grabs popcorn \\*, 
  itt : people who ** still ** believe this is about relocating people currently in germany to eastern europe . 
  it is not . 
  it 's about people who ** are refugees ** ~ ~ , as in people who were granted asylum , ~ ~ ** in the border states ** being distributed among all eu states . 
  germany will also take the largest share , ~ ~ with over 30 % ~ ~ . 
  please make sure you know what you are talking about before being outraged . 
  edit : failed at math . 
  so much for making sure you know what you are talking about . 
  oops . 
  edit 2 : turns out i also failed at reading and fact checking . 
  that 's quite embarrassing . 
  i 'm just going to point everyone interested towards this [ q&a on emergency relocation ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-15-5698_en.htm ) which has all the important and accurate information . 
  guess i just learned a valuable lesson : `` fact check your own infos before calling people out for not fact checking '' . 
  how do they benefit the uk or germany ? 
  refugees distributed under the quota are exclusively from greece , italy and hungary and the largest share , ~ ~ more than 30 % ~ ~ , are going to germany , * on top of the ones who made it to germany on their own and were accepted there * . 
  not a single migrant will be taken out of germany and brought to poland . 
  no one is proposing that , yet a lot of people are under the impression that germany wants to get rid of the ones already there . 
   she made it perfectly clear any migrants trying to come into the eu will not be stopped . 
  that is absolute bullshit and it 's getting more ridiculous every time it gets repeated like some anti-refugee game of chinese whispers . 
  feel free to provide me with a source to prove your point . 
  merkel ca n't tell poland what to do , the eu council ** and ** parliament does and you ** do ** have democratically elected representatives in both . 
  the vast majority of eu states are for the quota system . 
  if you want to blame someone , blame all of the eu . 
  yes , germany is powerful in the eu , but it 's also backed by the majority of countries . 
  germany ca n't , but the council can . 
  contrary to popular belief in this sub , the majority of eu countries are * for the quota system * . 
  but since they want a unanimous decision , they do n't go by ( super ) majority vote and do n't overrule v4 . 
  at least not yet . 
  wow , this might be the dumbest video i 've ever seen . 
   [ angela merkel ] is the one who said there should be no limits to immigration from the muslim middle east to germany . 
  she started the recent stampede by calling for 800.000 migrants , first come first serve , no application forms necessary , no proof of any danger to your lives necessary and anyone who can make it immediately gets thousands of dollars in special benefits , plus access to germany 's existing welfare state . 
  are you serious ? 
  is this really what / r/europe thinks is happening ? 
  why is anyone listening to this clown ? 
  germany has n't asked facebook to delete anti-immigration opinion , they asked them to enforce their ** own policy of deleting racism ** and to comply with german law against ** hate speech capable of inciting violence ** . 
  stop spreading this nonsense that germany is forcing facebook to censor differing opinion . 
  it 's simply false . 
  are you serious ? 
  there are a ton of examples where god commands people to kill others in the bible and the koran similarly commands people not to kill . 
   austria can not take any more people . 
  i 'm very grateful to germany that it is not closing the borders to those with a right to asylum , '' said austrian chancellor werner faymann . 
  yeah , that 's not really what he said . 
  the translator kind of fucked up . 
  das werden sie verstehen und deshalb bin ich auch dankbar daf\u00fcr das deutschland nicht sagt wir machen die grenzen dicht my translation :  austrias emergency shelters are currently full . 
  austria will face this challenge as a nation and will not simply hope that our neighbor takes care of it . 
  but austria can not take care of all of them alone without germany . 
  that 's why i am grateful that germany does n't close its borders . 
  to be fair , it 's not that easy to tell in this sub these days . 
  from this very thread :  good , if ** the left ** wo n't come to their senses then millions will vote them out of office for decades to come . 
  not really . 
  merkel seems to have a problem with predicting what the headline will be after she addresses an issue . 
  what she did say was that the approach to integration where we do nothing and just hope that people will adopt to a new society without a concentrated effort to integrate them has failed . 
  i 'm sorry , but after reading your post history , i do n't think that a debate between us has any point . 
  our ideologies seem to be so different that it will be almost impossible to find any common ground . 
  feel free to check my history , i 'm sure you 'll agree . 
  but to answer your question , his particular brand of anarcho-capitalist libertarianism is fringe , even to just general libertarianism . 
  he 's a global warming denier , regurgitating the same old arguments that have been debunked over and over again . 
  his view on mental illness is way out there and his defoo movement bordering on a cult . 
  while he might not always outright say that it 's a conspiracy , he strongly implies it . 
  in this particular video , he fails to make any arguments . 
  all he does is rant about how great western culture is and how backwards other cultures are , seemingly without doing any actual research on those cultures ( for example ignoring the almost 100 year history of secularism in syria ) . 
  he does n't seem to understand how metaphors and similes work . 
  they are great tools to * explain * arguments , but do n't work as an argument themselves . 
  all he does is say * a * is like * b * and * b * is bad , therefore * a * is bad .
