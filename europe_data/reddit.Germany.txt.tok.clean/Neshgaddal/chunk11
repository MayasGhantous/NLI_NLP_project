  in order for it to be illegal in germany , a reasonable person must be likely to think that they did . 
  they were standing around handing out pamphlets . 
   in my country pretending to be a police officer or any public official is illegal . 
  it is too in germany , but only if a `` reasonable person '' would believe that they are actually police officers . 
  nobody believed they had any real authority . 
  i live in wuppertal where this happened and it was covered a lot in the local media . 
  they did n't try to impose a law and they did n't pretend to have any authority . 
  they were standing around handing out pamphlets to people they thought were muslim . 
  so a bachelorette party group , all with fashion police shirts handing out fake tickets while bar hopping * should * be illegal ? 
  good thing that everyone here exhibits a healthy dose of skepticism and at least skimmed the actual report instead of simply accepting things that fit their narrative and going on a rant on how pc culture is ruining everything . 
  oh wait , they do n't and did exactly that . 
  that police officers fear being called racist appears once in that report , by an unnamed victim without any evidence . 
  we do n't know if she has any basis for that or if it 's pure conjecture . 
  the report does mention that police officers should n't have to fear being branded culturally insensitive , but it 's a minor point and again without indicating that this is actually happening or that it 's a major problem . 
  the other hundred and something pages identify a lack of training and mistrust in the police as the main problems . 
  if you accuse the other side of preventing an honest debate , the least thing you could do is abiding by the same rules you demand others to follow . 
  also football clubs . 
  i remember a presentation by a counterterrorism expert from some us agency that found the biggest connection between islamic terrorists was that most of them played soccer in all-muslim football clubs , while religiosity and mosque attendance had basically no or a negative correlation . 
  take this with a grain of salt , as this was years ago and i might remember things wrong . 
  i ca n't find that video , but i 'll post it here if i find it . 
  overweight just means bmi 25 to 30 , which is 80kg to 100kg for a 1.80 m tall man . 
  being overweight is n't * that * bad for your health , although it does have some negative effects . 
  the real problem is obesity , which is bmi 30 and up . 
  [ this map ] ( http://www.worldobesity.org/resources/world-map-obesity/?map=overview-men ) is really interesting , particularly for comparing the difference between gender in countries . 
  16.5 % of men in turkey are obese , but 29.4 % of women . 
  a similar split is happening in the baltics , although the rates are overall much lower . 
  the rates are much closer together in west and central europe . 
  but saudi arabia ( probably quite literally ) takes the cake with a stunning 50.4 % obesity rate in women . 
  it 's hard to get passionate about switching one uninspiring bureaucrat for another . 
  it 's the same thing as with * every * divisive issue . 
  side a thinks that all people on side b want to ban islam and deport the remaining muslim or worse , while side b thinks that all people on side a want to allow sharia law everywhere with weekly stonings on the village square , because religious freedom . 
  and pretty much as with * every * divisive issue , nobody * actually * holds the caricaturized view the other side thinks everybody has . 
  there are n't even two neatly separated camps . 
  most people are in the middle , far far away from both extremes , somewhere around the big blurry line . 
  the cause is pretty awesomely explained in [ this cgp grey video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3j_rhkqjc ), 
  if you can call that ` leben ' ... 
  shit , turkey would send [ the count ] ( https://imgur.com/oxh1jlc ) ? 
  i heard the eu council being called a puppet show , but this is getting ridiculous . 
  at least they 'll get their numbers straight . 
  president carson sounds imo way scarier . 
  german here . 
  apparently , i 'm doing it the ` baltic ' way . 
  edit : now i 'm no longer sure . 
  thanks op , you made me forget how to write . 
   the migrant crisis is not eu 's fault , but the institution could do a great deal more to handle it . 
  for one , it should do a better job of balancing the amount of refugees each country gets . 
  immigration and asylum policy is * the * most controversial issue in the eu . 
  and not just now , they 've been fighting about this * literally * since the inception of the eu . 
  every time there is some larger problem with immigration , they debate for some time and then come up with some half-assed compromise . 
  everyone agrees that we need some kind of united eu policy . 
  but everyone has their own idea of what that policy looks like . 
  they did n't agree on a useful plan after ww2 , they did n't find a solution after the yugoslav wars or the end of the cold war and they 're not going to implement one now . 
  i do n't think you understand . 
  there is no right wing media , they are all left wing , center left at best . 
  because afd and fp\u00d6 are the new center and everything left of them are basically communists . 
   what exactly are the criteria for being a safe country ? 
  * the life and liberty of the applicant are not threatened on account of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ; * the principle of non-refoulement , in accordance with the geneva convention , is respected ; * the prohibition of removal , in violation of the right to freedom from torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment as laid down in international law , is respected ; * ** the possibility exists to request refugee status and , if it is granted , to receive protection in accordance with the geneva convention . 
  ** [ source ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:l33140 ), 
  but you * can * make a surface journey from syria and irak into the eu without passing through a safe country . 
  turkey is * not * a safe third country for refugees . 
  less than 15 % of the 2 million refugees have a place in the camps . 
  over half of all people do not receive any assistance . 
  they do not get asylum in turkey , but '' temporary protection status '' . 
  you can agree with that status or not , but under the 1951 refugee convention , turkey is * not a safe country for refugees * . 
  having `` trust in the eu '' is n't necessarily synonymic to being pro-eu . 
  i 'm very pro-eu as a concept , but i 'd be very hesitant to say that i trust the eu in it 's current form . 
  true , it 's just that the greek/turkish border in particular is not the issue . 
  most of the people coming through * that * border are genuine refugees whose rights are not guaranteed in turkey by eu and unhcr standard . 
  only 10-15 % of the ~ 2 million refugees in turkey live in the government camps . 
  the rest are basically unaccounted for with very limited assistance . 
  sure , everyone entering the eu should be registered and processed in the first eu country they enter . 
  but all that 's going to achieve right now is that greece and italy are getting crushed under the weight . 
  there * needs * to be a united european response , which includes a plan for the borders , effective processing and assistance to turkey , but also a distribution plan . 
   i am talking about economic migrants , who are about 60 % of the current inflow of migrants this year . 
  the last numbers i 've heard are more like 40 % , but that 's beside the point . 
  they are a huge problem either way . 
  most of them do n't come through turkey or greece . 
  the majority of economic migrants come from albania , kosovo , serbia and macedonia . 
  the next biggest group are sub-saharan africans . 
  most of those do n't come through turkey either . 
  closed greek borders are n't going to reduce the number of economic migrants . 
  efficient processing and faster deportations will . 
  i know , right ? 
  i 'm only 6-8 weeks from joining the rest of you in the 21st century . 
  are we playing who has the worst connection ? 
  ** 25 $ for 1mbit ** on the outskirts of germanys biggest metropolitan area . 
  if my brother watches a 360p youtube video , my connections becomes basically useless . 
  i ca n't browse reddit when he wants to play games . 
  but there is hope . 
  our isp told us that we might be able to upgrade to 3mbit soon . 
  i 'm not posting to convince * you * . 
  * you * have already proven that you 're a liar and a lost cause . 
  i 'm posting to convince the people on the fence of your disgraceful tactics , so that they might mistrust you and your kind the next time you post your crap . 
   i have clearly show you that you are wrong . 
  you have done no such thing . 
  ireland has basically the same rules for who can come as part of reunification as germany , except that they can make an exception . 
  you seem to underestimate how hard it is to show dependency ; from the law this exception is based on :  `` any grandparent , parent , brother , sister , child , grandchild , ward or guardian of the refugee who is suffering from a mental or physical disability , to such an extent that it is not reasonable for him/her to maintain him/herself fully . '' so how realistic is it that someone can claim 4 mentally or physically impaired parents ? 
  how many of those who can claim that have 4-5 children under 18 ? 
  i challenge you to find * one * case where one immigrant was able to bring even 5 people . 
   worse case about 10 extra people .
