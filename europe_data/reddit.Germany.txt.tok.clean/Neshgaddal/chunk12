  if we are making up fantasy scenarios , why stop there ? 
  the wife could have a child every year , so that 's 17 normal children , then they had 5 mentally challenged ones before that , they are clearly dependent . 
  4 parents , all dependent , and each of them 4 siblings , also dependent . 
  `` every single one of them will bring 43 family members '' . 
  you were clearly insinuating in your op that 8-9 is the average . 
  that 160,000 refugees means around 1.5 million people in the long run . 
  i 've shown you that this is n't even close to true . 
  yet , you 're still defending the use of that number . 
  it 's ridiculous and dishonest . 
  all i want is that people do n't spread these ridiculous numbers that are clearly made up . 
  how is this controversial ? 
   they just need to prove they are dependent on parents are you serious ? 
  are you really going to claim that each refugee will be able to `` show clear evidence of dependency '' for 8-9 family members ? 
  do you have * any * numbers on how often this actually happens ? 
  the rate of reunifications per immigrant are ** even lower in ireland than they are in germany ** , with less than 3000 reunifications per year in the last 5 years and between 30k and 75k immigrants per year .

  see , this is what i 'm talking about when i say you 're not up for an honest debate . 
  can you honestly say that your 8-9 people figure is anything but a straight up lie ? 
   8-9 family members you will have to fly in !, 
  family reunification is exclusively for spouses and children under 18 . 
  not for parents , not for siblings , not for cousins . 
  the one applying for reunification also needs to have a stable job and be able to provide for the people coming . 
  [ here are the statistics ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/networks/european_migration_network/reports/docs/emn-studies/family-reunification/2._de_emn_ncp_small-scale_study_iv_family_reunification_final_en_version_en.pdf ) ( p. 39 table 1 for numbers ) for family reunification in germany . 
  it 's between 50,000 and 85,000 per year ** for all immigrants ** , not just refugees . 
  so with between 700,000 and 1,500,000 immigrants per year , that makes a rate of to 0.03 to 0.12 reunifications per immigrant , ** two full orders of magnitude apart from your 8-9 ** . 
  but do n't let facts get in the way of your ranting . 
  ** edit : ** oh look , i 'm downvoted for inconvenient facts again . 
  guess the citizens are too concerned right now to have an honest debate . 
  that 's true . 
  the biggest difference is that precedents are never binding . 
  but the supreme court is an exception . 
  it 's basically the exact equivalent to other supreme courts . 
  if they find a law to be unconstitutional , it becomes invalid . 
  they already struck down an earlier version of this law , but said that data retention is n't unconstitutional on principle . 
  they will almost certainly hear a case on this new version and will hopefully strike it down again . 
  nice editorializing , op . 
  the article does n't mention islam , islamisation or even pegida once and it 's not in the original title . 
  it 's about anti-nazi protests . 
  it 's about one state ( not * the * german state as your title implies ) financially supporting groups that try to dissuade people from joining neo nazi groups . 
  you 're right . 
  that 's why germany is n't telling anyone to take people from germany . 
  quotas are to distribute refugees from greece and italy . 
  as i said , i 'm not entirely sure , because it 's hard to find official information , but from what i 've read , they are not considered safe * because * they are not in the eu . 
  the only countries considered safe by the eu are eu , norway , switzerland and some , but not all of ex-yugoslavia . 
  i 'm not entirely sure and it 's hard to find information on it . 
  these are the requirements by the eu to be designated a safe third country : * the life and liberty of the applicant are not threatened on account of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ; * the principle of non-refoulement , in accordance with the geneva convention , is respected ; * the prohibition of removal , in violation of the right to freedom from torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment as laid down in international law , is respected ; * the possibility exists to request refugee status and , if it is granted , to receive protection in accordance with the geneva convention . 
  [ source ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:l33140 ) i 'm not sure which , if any , of these turkey violates , but for now , that 's what the eu decided . 
  it might change soon though . 
  it 's not . 
  the first country the eu recognizes as safe between syria and germany is greece . 
  edit : / r/europe downvotes relevant facts again . 
  stay classy , concerned citizens . 
  `` these illegal immigrants need to start taking personal responsibility , because the locals just ca n't help themselves '', 
  the current mess of an eu asylum policy * is * the half baked version that took 50 years to agree on . 
  common asylum policy has been * the * most controversial issue since the inception of the eu . 
  partially . 
  the police ( as well as about a thousand other people ) can access the identity of user data through an online portal . 
  they only need a court order to access the full connection data if they suspect someone of a `` significant '' crime or any crime that was `` committed through telecommunications '' . 
  the judges only check if this is the case , so basically only check if the police filled out the form correctly . 
  berlin tracks the number of granted and denied applications for surveillance court orders . 
  they have yet to have one denied . 
  the music and film industry as well as about a dozen countries have the same access . 
  german intelligence has full access to all the data without the need for a court order . 
  this is so fucked up , especially since there is basically no judicial oversight . 
  lets hope the bundesverfassungsgericht ( germanys supreme court ) kills it once again . 
  so no source , just another meaningless doomsday prediction , got it . 
  source ? 
  according to the official statistics , the overwhelming majority of denied asylum applications are from the balkans . 
  the only african country in the top 10 is eritrea and they are hardly economic migrants . 
  that 's not what the statistics say : [ official bamf statistics ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201509-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) . 
  albania and kosovo are the second and third in asylum applications ( after syrians ) and make 80k of the 300k processed applications this year . 
  they both have an acceptance rating of under 1 % . 
  serbia and macedonia make another 35k , also with under 1 % acceptance . 
  very few people from africa and the middle east who are n't legitimate asylum seekers come to germany . 
  by far the largest share of economic migrants come from albania , kosovo , serbia and macedonia . 
  the overwhelming majority of denied asylum applications are from the balkans . 
  plans and implementations are of course very different things . 
  it remains to be seen if they actually implement what they propose in a way that works , but the * plan * is exactly what is needed . 
  the current bottleneck are the first accommodation and application process , which is clogged up by applications from purely economic migrants , mainly from albania and kosovo ( which , together with people from serbia and macedonia , make roughly 40 % of all applications ) . 
  faster processing and faster , more effective ( read actually happening ) deportations are exactly the way to handle this . 
  i really hope that it works and think that it is the right plan , but i understand that people are skeptical . 
  there were quite a few students from all over ex-yugoslavia in my highschool . 
  they formed the tightest cliques while their parents would n't dare to even be seen with each other . 
  sure , they would give each other shit , but more like siblings than anything else . 
  is there an addon that does this ? 
  that way it should count as an ad view and the content producer would get paid , right ? 
   so 1m in 2015 , 2m in 2016 , 4m in 2017 ... [ and every human being in the world will be living in germany by 2027 . 
  no one is rightfully held in gitmo . 
  if you have evidence that someone is supporting a terrorist organization , then charge him for that and give him a fair trial . 
  this was obviously not the case with this guy or otherwise he would n't have been released . 
  it does n't matter if you suspect someone of jaywalking , tax evasion , rape or genocide . 
  everyone deserves due process and a fair trial . 
  this is n't the opinion of some `` european leftist '' , this is basic human rights . 
  if someone rapes someone else he/she deserves to go to prison . 
  if he/she is tortured to gain a confession , he/she deserves compensation for that . 
  those two things are not connected . 
  i am under no obligation to be on either side . 
  i can condemn both sides . 
  this headline is meant to suggest that the outcome now legitimizes that they illegally detained and tortured someone , which is absolutely wrong . 
  do n't join a terrorist organization and do n't torture people .
