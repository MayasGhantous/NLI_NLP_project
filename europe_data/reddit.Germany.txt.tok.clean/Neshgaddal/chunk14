  society has also the right to shun him for those remarks . 
  i , as a private person have * every right * to discriminate people based on their ideology . 
  the government has not , but this is n't what is happening here . 
  that 's quite beautiful . 
  i still think they picked the wrong hymn for a united germany . 
  [ the hymn of the gdr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afoqrmfyql0 ) sounds way better and the text fits better , too . 
  wait , what ? 
  your examples are n't of people who said `` something against the refugees '' . 
  one is about celebrating the death of a child , the other is * literally advocating nazi concentration camps for refugees * . 
  the first one is n't racist or xenophobic , but it is in support of a violent mob . 
  and all that on a public forum . 
  what 's wrong with you that you think those comments are a perfectly valid stance to have ? 
  how can anyone be surprised to be called a nazi if they 're literally advocating nazi policy ? 
  i am against germany 's limits on freedom of speech , but part of the freedom of speech is to live with the consequences when you say stupid stuff in public . 
  i do n't know why this was removed , but there is at least one odd part :  a caravan of ambulances and swat team vans careened down streets lined with gawking residents . 
  what ? 
  there are no german swat teams . 
  the german equivalent is the sek , which are not called for a brawl . 
  these were normal police vans . 
  it was allowed before , but usually only after multiple lengthy appeal procedures . 
  this law changes it so that the buildings can be used immediately while the appeal is not resolved . 
  if the appeal goes in favor of the owner , the buildings have to be given back and be compensated for the time it was used . 
   it 's questionable if forced sale of property for the purpose of housing non-citizens with unverified status qualifies as public good . 
  it really is n't . 
  after someone applies for asylum , they have a right to remain here until their application has been processed . 
  the city has a public obligation to house them . 
  so having the space to do that is quite obviously ( at least legally ) in the public interest . 
  so what you 're saying is that you trust the headline of the article , but you do n't trust the body of the article , because that 's just propaganda ? 
  ok . you were right . 
  i was wrong about the refugee convention . 
  i see how it looks like i was omitting the second paragraph to deceive people . 
  that was n't my intent , i apologize for that . 
  that being said , i see no reason to edit my first post , as my original point is still right . 
  germany can not deport refugees or asylum seekers to an unsafe country , even if they commit a crime . 
  the german implementation of said convention makes that clear . 
  \u00a7 60 aufenthg paragraph 8 says that ( 1 ) does n't apply to people who committed a serious crime , however ( 9 ) specifically states that ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) still apply . 
  hmm , you might be right . 
  i 'll have to check that again . 
  i 'll delete my post for now . 
  ~ ~ that does n't apply to refugees . 
  it 's overruled by the geneva [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/protect/protection/3b66c2aa10.pdf ) \u00a7 33 ~ ~ ~ ~  no contracting state shall expel or return ( ` refouler ' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . ~ ~ i 'm probably wrong . 
  ~ ~  edit : / u/thett found the law i was looking for and , surprise , it 's an actual law . 
  [ 1 ] ~ ~ ~ ~ that does n't apply to refugees . 
  it 's overruled by the geneva [ 1951 refugee convention ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/protect/protection/3b66c2aa10.pdf ) \u00a7 33 ~ ~ ~ ~  no contracting state shall expel or return ( ` refouler ' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . ~ ~ turns out i 'm probably wrong . 
   so starting a fight over some bullshit would n't be worth the risk if you are facing deportation , right ? 
  and no one would jaywalk if it carried the death penalty . 
  that does n't mean it 's a good idea . 
  applying for asylum is n't just something we tolerate and can stop if we feel like it . 
  they have a right to apply for asylum guaranteed by the constitution . 
  they also have a constitutional right to a fair trial and a constitutional right to human dignity . 
  these rights explicitly apply to all humans , not just citizens . 
  if the authorities find that they are being prosecuted and have to fear for their lives in their country of origin , ** we can not send them back ** . 
  this would go against the very core of the constitution . 
  at most , we could deport them to the first eu country they entered , so probably greece or italy . 
  i ca n't believe how often this has to be explained . 
  maybe they should not only hand out the constitution in arabic to refugees , but also in german to citizens . 
  3 ) on the contrary , i think that if you claimed german ancestry people would be happy and interested . 
  just make sure that you actually * know * something about your ancestors , or people will be pretty disappointed with that conversation . 
  like others have said ; do n't claim to be `` a < european country  american '' if you have no other connection to that country other than the one great great grandfather that emigrated . 
  it just sounds silly . 
  you 're trolling right ? 
  why did you want me to link you the law if you 're just not going to read it . 
   whosoever [ ... ] disseminates a presentation of the content indicated in no 1 above by radio , media services , or telecommunication services [ ... ] shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three years or a fine . 
  facebook hosts this speech and is required to remove it as soon as they are made aware of it . 
  they do n't , so they are breaking the law . 
  people like you and me are being censored just for voicing an opinion . 
  what has europe come to when you ca n't even advocate the extermination of lesser races without being called a nazi . 
  damn leftists . 
  it 's not a us based firm though . 
  facebook europe is based in ireland . 
  the only people who have their posts deleted are already radicals . 
  remember , this is n't about anti-immigration opinion . 
  this is about clear cases of racism and hate speech ( as in calling for murder and genocide ), 
  oh for fuck 's sake , this is n't about censoring differing opinion . 
  it 's the german government asking facebook to enforce ** facebooks own rules ** and to comply ** with century old german laws ** . 
  you can rant about immigration on facebook all you want . 
  it 's only about hate speech . 
  true , but i think / u/sanebrz 's point is that the results are n't necessarily indicative of the majority opinion of turks in germany . 
  it might be , but it 's also possible that only the most political care about the election , while the others simply do n't vote . 
  meaning at worst , akp would only have ( 53 % * 34 %  18 % support . 
  from what i 've gathered , the quran forbids alcohol from dates and vines , says to stay away from ( but not clearly forbids ) all intoxicants and clearly forbids to pray while drunk or high . 
  but that 's not a bug , that 's a feature . 
  it 's actually the entire point of the system . 
  the parties are supposed to compromise with each other to reach a majority . 
  why should a cdu be able to govern alone when 58 % * did n't * vote for them . 
  i have no doubt that there was * some * astroturfing going on on reddit , but / r/politics has had a very strong liberal bias for years . 
  i highly doubt that sub would have looked much different without ctr . 
  / r/politics is obviously the wrong place as a source of unbiased information . 
  all of reddit is , but so is every other single platform . 
  a lot of people will tell you now how they * just knew * it would happen or how it was actually inevitable . 
  but the truth is , this * was * unexpected . 
  the experts gave him 30 % chance at best and * those * were criticized for overestimating his chances . 
  bookies , as in people who ca n't afford to be biased , gave him less 20 % chance the day before the election . 
  you can see how everyone on / r/politics is trying their hardest to find explanations and the blame game is on in full force . 
  his success is literally stunning . 
   in many european cities , you can * literally * take the city bus to farms . 
  as someone who took the city bus from my family 's farm to my inner city high school every day for 9 years , this made me laugh . 
  the way he said it makes it sound as if this would absolutely blow an americans mind . 
  based on reviews from professional critics , the movie is pretty mediocre . 
  this controversy will probably increase sales .
