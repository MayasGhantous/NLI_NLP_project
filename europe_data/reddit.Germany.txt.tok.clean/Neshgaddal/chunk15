  good old feint retreat . 
  fake preparing to leave , then double down on federalization . 
  i 'd imagine it goes something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5jnee7at0m ), 
  i never made it past nl/plo 25 , ironically because i could n't cope with the variance and went on tilt . 
  i did pay a few nights out and a vacation with it though . 
  it really does change your view . 
  what bugs me the most is how many people think that the outcome somehow decides if something was a good or bad decision . 
  kids should learn to play poker in school . 
  i do n't think that 's a meaningful number . 
  based on [ these numbers ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/waffengebrauch_der_polizei_in_deutschland#zahlen ) , the average number of people killed by police in the last 20 years is 9.1 with a standard deviation of 3.6 . 
  so the increase last year is far from statistically significant . 
  even a year without a single police shooting would not be significant either . 
  basing policies on this `` increase '' would be ridiculous . 
  i wonder how many christians would agree with `` god 's law is above man 's law '' . 
  it would be really interesting to see the difference there between european countries . 
  from what i understand , your next of kin can still object under this new law . 
  who is denying that * some * people like this exist ? 
  however , you are implying that `` immigration is always good , dissenting opinion will be censored '' is not only * a * , but * the main * position among left wing people . 
  this is simply false . 
  / u/theogr is calling you out for fighting strawmen of `` the left '' that have little basis in reality . 
  reddit overhypes everything so do n't expect any culinary revelations , but it 's popular for a reason . 
  it 's cheap , prepared super quickly and convenient to eat while walking/traveling . 
  also , it 's meat in bread . 
  humanity has loved that since the dawn of civilization . 
  it somehow tastes especially good while drunk . 
  i did . 
  this is literally the first sentence of the body of the article :  there is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed , and that ** racial groups can not be biologically defined ** . 
  here are some highlights from the sources to this sentence :  * using the two most commonly used biological concepts of race , chimpanzees are indeed subdivided into races ** but humans are not ** . 
   * a tree-like structure among humans has been falsified whenever tested , so this practice is scientifically indefensible . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1369848613000460 )  * genetic surveys and the analyses of dna haplotype trees show that human `` races '' are not distinct lineages , and that this is not due to recent admixture ; human `` races '' are not and never were `` pure . '', 
  [ source ] ( https://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2faa.1998.100.3.632 ) human populations are simply not distinct enough to warrant this degree of separation . 
  there are no sharp edges between groups and there very likely never were . 
  more importantly , the way the word is colloquially used , as white/black/asian etc , has no scientific basis . 
  are you sure * you * read it ? 
  because to me , it confirms exactly what / u/steppdeckenwolf said : ** biologically speaking ** , there are no human races . 
  this is very true . 
  in the bigger cities , you will probably not have any problems getting by with just english . 
  the international students at my uni in hamburg always complain that they do n't get to practice their german because everyone just automatically switches to english as soon as they hear broken german . 
  outside of the bigger cities , it drops quite quickly though . 
  i 've used nl rail recently and i thought it was pretty nice . 
  however , i noticed that the trains were often quite slow , especially closer to residential areas . 
  do you know why that is ? 
  did the laws on noise pollution change recently and they have n't caught up on building noise barriers ? 
  i assume you guys would n't plan and build railway that is designed for 20km/h speeds . 
  what do you mean ? 
  of course the number in the current year is n't the real issue . 
  obviously i 'm using humor to cope with a terrible and complicated situation that i have de facto zero control over . 
  i 'm sorry you did n't think it was funny . 
  can we as a civilization just decide that 2016 had its chance and blew it ? 
  lets just go from july 2016 to january 2017 . 
  [ black helicopters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_helicopter ) . 
  i 'm guessing it was actually 3 ) a minority group in the army that gambled on the rest of the military and the opposition seizing the opportunity and falling in line behind them . 
  they put the opposition in a though spot ; if they do n't support them now and it fails , the government will likely stomp out the remaining critics and lose any chance for a successful coup in the future . 
  they gave them an ultimatum ; now or never . 
  it seems they chose never . 
  is n't das the idee behind apps like [ flewent ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flewent/kboplipnhaapngnahmdgminfepnokjhh/ ) ? 
  totally agree . 
  the french even based their dub for the persuaders on brandts work instead of the original dialogue . 
  a good chunk of their popularity in germany is probably thanks to rainer brandt , the dialogue author for the german dub . 
  he changed the dialogue considerably , injecting a different humor and often adding lines that were n't in the original ( including almost all lines during the action scenes ) . 
  interestingly enough , the betting odds barely changed in the last two months , still just shy of 3 to 1 for clinton . 
  i just hope that the negotiations go smoothly without any sign of revenge or scare tactics . 
  trying to scare the skeptics in other nations into staying by making an example out of the uk is n't just childish , i also doubt it would work . 
  on the contrary ; i think that would backfire spectacularly and only strengthen the skeptics position . 
  we should just try to negotiate a mutually beneficial treaty with the uk just like we would with any other country and make the best out of a complicated situation . 
  considering that i 've been one of the few people on this sub that has been consistently pro-refugee and anti-discrimination along your side over the past few month , your implied accusation of xenophobia on my part is particularly hurtful . 
  maybe i do have a double standard when it comes to turkey and i 'm especially hard on them . 
  i personally disagree with any non-secular laws , regardless of which religion they favor . 
  german law , which also has quite a few of them , is no exception to this . 
  erdogan has been steering turkey away from their secular heritage , but you know that this is not the only reason to object to turkeys accession . 
  letting greece into the eu but not turkey was not due to racism . 
  i 'm not against it in principle , but there is a lot of reform necessary and i do n't see any of that happening under erdogan . 
  my money is on neither , just a regular old nutjob . 
  i have absolutely no problem with * turks * being muslim , but i do have a problem with * turkey * being muslim . 
  a eu state needs to be secular at least in large parts , but turkey under erdogan is actively moving away from that . 
  that 's very good . 
  i 've just tried [ this americas quiz ] ( http://lizardpoint.com/geography/americas-quiz.php ) and [ this us states quiz ] ( http://online.seterra.net/en/vgp/3003 ) . 
  i sucked at both . 
  ( 65 % and 35 % ), 
  can confirm . 
  just scored 100 % on [ this test ] ( http://lizardpoint.com/geography/europe-quiz.php ) about european countries , but miserably failed [ this one ] ( http://online.seterra.net/en/vgp/3014 ) about german states ( got 55 % ) . 
  pff , baguettes are just long br\u00f6tchen . 
  i know of one of those preachers in germany . 
  a 30-something bald dude who 's usually standing outside hamburg central station or riding the subway from/to there . 
  that guy is doing anti-theists a huge service with his hateful rants . 
  nobody wants to be on * that * guys side . 
  you should ask the us how their `` give crazy people a platform to discredit themselves '' - strategy is working out for them . 
  it 's of course more complicated than that , but in essence ; yes . 
  from what i can see , outside of the two fringe camps ( let everybody in and let nobody in ) , basically everyone agrees that this would be the best way to do it . 
  the disagreement is more about the details : by what standard are people to be accepted ? 
  what happens to the accepted ? 
  camps in greece ? 
  redistribution ? 
  if so , how ? 
  what happens to the rejected ? 
  who pays for the necessary infrastructure ? 
  the problem is that all those questions have to be answered * before * we can strengthen the eu borders , or otherwise risk turning both the already existing humanitarian crisis and economic crisis in greece in to catastrophes . 
  we ca n't just say `` alright , borders closed now until we figure this shit out '' . 
  the turkey-deal delayed the problem a bit , but it 's no replacement for a complete and united eu response . 
  the country they are to be deported to has to agree to it .
