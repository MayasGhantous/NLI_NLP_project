  i 'm not sure if this is part of the agreement with turkey or if they only take back people from greece . 
  outside of this or similar agreements , turkey has no obligation or incentive to take back violent criminals that are n't its citizens . 
  and i never claimed it was . 
  not being killed or tortured by your government , as well as equality before the law and a fair trial however , * is * a human right . 
  a just government ca n't aid another government in violating these rights or they are violating them themselves by proxy . 
  that law is literally the first article of our constitution and is protected by the [ eternity clause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eternity_clause ) . 
  i 'm quite happy that my government is not allowed to violate basic human rights when it 's convenient or popular . 
  it 's complicated . 
  theoretically , foreign criminals who are sentenced to jail for more than 3 years can be deported . 
  the problem is that germany ca n't deport people to a country where they are likely to face persecution and will not receive a fair trial . 
  so if their asylum application would have been granted before , that implies that they ca n't be deported . 
  the german constitution guarantees human dignity and the right to a fair trial not just to citizens , but to * all * people , so it ca n't aid a foreign government in violating these rights . 
  the application can be denied , but we 'd be stuck with them anyways , turning them in to `` geduldete '' ( tolerated ) : people who are in germany illegally , but who ca n't be deported either . 
  if their application would have been denied before , they can be deported , but they should have been anyways . 
  but products with an alcohol content of over 1.2 % are exempt from mandatory nutrition labels . 
  let 's hope this law forces the eus hand to finally fix this . 
  it 's debatable if there 's a need for or benefit from warning labels , but there is absolutely no excuse for not having nutritional information on it . 
  depends on what you define as canadian content . 
  basically 80 % of cw and syfys programming is filmed in vancouver or toronto , though most of them by us producers .

  like most germans , i had english in school for 9 years , but i was never any good at it . 
  i always just barely got a passing grade . 
  i 'm at my current level thanks to english tv shows and the internet . 
  now that i think about it , the person i have to thank the most for my english proficiency is ivar combrinck , the guy responsible for the german dubbing of the simpsons and futurama . 
  this hack made the dubbed versions only barely watchable , messing up almost all puns and wordplays , which made watching those shows in english much more attractive . 
  i had to take a toefl for uni a few years ago and got a score of 115 , which is equivalent to an 8.5 ielts / c2 cefr . 
  i see . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  the marked ammo proposal does sound dumb . 
  i 'm going to have to do some research on the existing regulation for medical issues . 
  as someone leaning towards the pro-regulation side , with some exceptions , that sounds quite reasonable . 
  most of the rejected proposals sound like they would n't actually deter gun violence , but be a significant cost for hunter and sport shooters . 
  a common gun owner database seems like a no-brainer to me . 
  i have some questions , though : was there a plan what the increased taxes should have been used for ? 
  could you explain the `` marking of ammunition '' part to me ? 
  what are the arguments against expiry dates and medical standards ? 
  that sounds like a good idea to me . 
  it reminds me of my very senile and half blind great aunt standing on our balcony with her hunting rifle shooting at everything she identified as a goshawk .

  just finished this pasta salad for a party buffet today : __________________________ * 500 g penne * 400 g feta * 1 small cucumber * 3 red onions * 2 long red chilis * 12 tbs olive oil * 12 tbs balsamic vinegar * 100 ml vegetable stock * fresh dill * salt , pepper __________________________ 1 . 
  cook pasta , let cool 2 . 
  with a tea spoon , scrape out seeds . 
  slice cucumber and chilis in ~ 2mm thin slices . 
  cube onions and feta 4 . 
  mix oil , vinegar , stock and chopped dill . 
  season with salt and pepper . 
  combine everything in a large bowl . 
  let it rest for a few ours in the fridge . 
  man , i love tacos . 
  but they 're virtually unheard of in germany . 
  most supermarkets at least stock hard shells ( for ridiculous prices ) , and large wheat tortillas , but i 've never even seen corn or taco sized wheat tortillas here . 
  so i have to make them myself , which is easy enough , but time consuming and they do n't really keep well . 
  you only get cilantro in asia shops , jalapenos are somewhat rare . 
  i would love to have a little hole in the wall taco joint near me , but there is only one restaurant in my city that serves them . 
  they 're expensive and not that great . 
  there seems to be a lot of information here , but my french sucks .

  [ the man in the high castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_man_in_the_high_castle_ ( tv_series \\ ) ) .

   she broke european law by illegally accepting refugees and transferring them to germany . 
  this is not true . 
  [ article 17 of the dublin iii regulation ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32013r0604 ) gives the states the right to assume responsibility over applications even if they are not the responsible country . 
  no one enforced dublin at the time of merkels announcement . 
  every country knew that it was n't enforceable , because it would have overwhelmed the border states . 
  she was stating the obvious . 
   benefits that are normal for europeans ( healthcare , peace , economic prosperity , welfare ) and that our great grandparents worked hard for are n't normal for refugees .

  first of all , you can only apply for your spouse and children under 18 .

  you also ca n't be dependent on governmental assistance , you have to have a stable job and you must be able to provide for the people you bring . 
  i 've seen the video and that 's not what i 'm asking for . 
  i 'm asking if we can make a lock that angels and demons can open , but the lock and the real key scream really loudly if one does . 
  as others have pointed out , the flaw is that we ca n't really force the bad guys to use the screaming lock and they can just use locks that neither angels nor demons can open . 
   germans really gave surprisingly little fucks about the attack . 
  any idea why that is ? 
  are we so jaded that attacks like this are just kind of expected or are we levelheaded people that do n't give into fear ? 
  both ? 
  neither ? 
  i do n't really understand why people , myself included , do n't really feel more affected by this .
