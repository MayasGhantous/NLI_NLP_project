  you can then just listen to it online or download it in your preferred format . 
  also , if you give us a script , you could mix different voices together like the [ radiolab intro ] ( https://vimeo.com/100451692 ) . 
  now , to take the ferry cost a nickel , and in those days , nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em . 
  `` gim me five bees for a quarter , '' you 'd say . 
  now where were we ... oh yeah . 
  the important thing was that i had an onion on my belt , which was the style at the time . 
  but the question was mainly if the had ever been unfaithful . 
  if you are in an open relationship , you would n't consider having sex with someone else unfaithful . 
  anders thomas jensen movies are really something special . 
  i like [ flickering lights ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236027/ ) a bit better than * in china they eat dogs * . 
  if you like his style , you 'll also like [ the green butchers ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342492/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) and [ old men in new cars ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246692/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ), 
   at least not the actual refugees that have come as a family or refugees that have provided actual proof or evidence for their refugee status . 
  but that is the main problem , is n't it ? 
  we ca n't decide who is a refugee and who is n't without due process . 
  up until this recent refugee crisis , we processed their asylum application , let legit refugees in and send the rest home . 
  it was n't perfect , but tolerable . 
  but the amount of people coming is just to high to be processed . 
  up until now we had the luxury of standing by our principle to give refuge to those who need it and tolerate the strain those who try to exploit the system put on it . 
  i 'm optimistic that we still can , but i have to admit that i 'm currently only indirectly affected by it . 
  my position could be very different if i lived in one of the areas most affected by this crisis . 
  if this continues to get worse , we have a hard decision to make : abandon our principles or take a ( even more ) severe hit to our economies . 
  some can . 
  refugees can apply for citizenship after being in germany for 6 years ( 8 years for normal migrants ) . 
  the language requirements are also lower for refugees . 
  it 's really sad to see that someone as integrated as her is threatened to be deported . 
  this is especially true considering germanys demography . 
  the government should have an interest in keeping people like her here for purely economic reasons . 
  i ca n't find any statistics on how many bullets were fired by us police , but the number of people killed by police each year is around 1000 . 
  the uk has roughly 1/5 of the population of the us , so in order to bring the number of people killed per year per capita to us levels , northern ireland police officers would have to kill ~ 200 people per year . 
  if the average police officer were on the force for 37.5 years , that would be one kill per career for every one of the 7500 psni officers . 
  i 've never heard anyone say that drafts cause the common cold , but i do believe that they can cause tense necks . 
  a lot of people , including my college educated parents , believe that walking barefoot on cold stone and going outside with wet hair will cause a cold . 
   also , i do n't for a second believe the 20.000 figure , unless it 's per month . 
  what is there to * believe * about `` the 20.000 figure '' ? 
  it 's the proposed number of people the eu * plans * to take in in the next 2 years under the quota system . 
  the number of refugees in the eu from syria is 250.000 . 
  you do n't seem to have paid all that much attention to the video you spend 5 paragraphs criticizing . 
  i 'm sorry you did n't find what you are looking for , but this sounds awesome . 
  like a treasure hunt for academic knowledge . 
  all that is missing is a living antagonist , trying to stop you from finding out the truth . 
  do you do stuff like this a lot ? 
  does this thread just attract a lot of linguaphiles who want to show off , or does the average user really speak 4 + languages ? 
  i only speak german and english . 
  i had some french in school but i ca n't put one coherent french sentence together . 
  exactly . 
  negotiating coalitions is one of the greatest feature of a multi party systems . 
  it 's about finding compromises that the largest part of the population agrees with . 
  parties that make unreasonable demands and thereby sabotaging the elections should be punished for it in the next election by the voters . 
  apparently , this does not happen in slovenia , which leads to the problem / u/radene is describing . 
  as someone almost completely ignorant of uk politics : eli5 why is this election interesting and why should i care about it ? 
  you californians sure are a contentious people . 
  i remember watching a video by a former cia profiler . 
  he was saying that mosque attendance had basically no correlation with extremism . 
  being in an all muslim soccer club was among the best predictors for extremism . 
  it 's been a few years , so i might be remembering things wrong and i ca n't find the video . 
  that would be an argument in favor of labeling products treated with glyphosate . 
  a gmo label would n't tell you whether or not it actually is treated with round up . 
  there is no mechanism common to * all * gmos by which they pose a danger to humans . 
  the eu gmo labeling law does n't give you any information regarding the effect on your health . 
  it 's only useful for people with ideological objections to genetic modifications . 
  edit : i 'm against ttip , by the way . 
  even though i 'm against the gmo labels , they are obviously the will of the european people . 
  you know that you can be against obesity without hating and bullying fat people , right ? 
  breakfast is usually bread with cheese or nutella . 
  the bread is either toast , light rye sourdough or pumpernickel . 
  the cheese is mostly matured gouda or what ever is on sale . 
  for dinner i rotate through maybe 15 or so dishes . 
  curries , chilli , sandwiches , pasta with pesto or marinara , pasta or potato casserole , variations of potatoes with some sauce . 
  the most common dish is pizza or tarte flamb\u00e9e . 
  i have a counter top pizza oven that makes incredible pizzas . 
  i make the sauce and dough from scratch and eat it at least once a week on average . 
  also , i 've recently recently discovered my love for tacos . 
  my guess is that the guy making this map imported the europe layer twice and then accidentally moved the germany shape while trying to pan . 
  the same shape was still beneath it , so he only moved one and did n't realize his mistake .

  shit like this happens all the time . 
   if horst seehofer is to be believed , family reunification will increase this number to at least 3 million , though 9 million is a more reasonable expectation . 
  again with the ridiculous family reunification fear mongering . 
  i 've asked you this before : why is it `` more reasonable '' to expect a 350 % increase due to family reunification instead of the 10-15 % increase we have seen in the past ? 
  [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/networks/european_migration_network/reports/docs/emn-studies/family-reunification/2._de_emn_ncp_small-scale_study_iv_family_reunification_final_en_version_en.pdf ) you can only apply for family reunification for your spouse and children under 18 . 
  you can only bring people you can support . 
  you can * not receive any governmental aids * . 
  are you seriously suggesting that * every single refugee * will be able to bring , house and support a wife and 2.5 children under 18 ? 
  how does that fit with your narrative that they 're all only going to live off welfare ? 
  like going out of your way to make him miserable ? 
  why ? 
  who is that going to benefit ? 
  that 's not justice , that 's not even retribution . 
  at that point , it 's pure sadism . 
  is there anywhere ?

  i love the us , so i would love to tell my friends with these kind of biases against it that i did n't notice any difference in crime or violence and that the main difference is in statistics and numbers only . 
  but i ca n't , because some idiot decided to stab passerby 's and i think was shot by the police literally 50m from the house i was staying at in san diego . 
  i 'm still not quite sure what to make of that . 
  like i said , i * used to * eat 50 % of my calories in snacks , now it 's more like 20 % -25 % . 
  i also * used to * be obese . 
  26kg down since august . 
  so much this . 
  before i started tracking , i never realized that i used to eat like 50 % of my daily calories in snacks .
