  if they 're ok , you get to eat a snickers and if they 're not , your family gets rich of the wrongful death lawsuit . 
  win-win . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.mapbox.com/labs/twitter-gnip/languages/#3/51.78/6.86 ) is an interactive web map version of it , where you can pan and zoom . 
  has an imho even worse legend than this one , though . 
  and if you read my posts , you 'll see that i did n't accuse you of making unfounded assumptions , i just posted my opinion on making unfounded assumptions . 
  let 's not kid ourselves , both your and my accusations were obviously implied and i stand by mine : your implied accusation was wrong . 
  yeah , i read that on / r/de . 
  that does n't change my original point in the slightest , though . 
  assuming someone is guilty without evidence is wrong and remains wrong even if it turns out they actually were guilty . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  there is a more recent and more fitting event people should be reminded of : [ the rostock-lichtenhagen-pogroms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rostock-lichtenhagen_riots ), 
  i 'm against everything the afd stands for , but can we please not slander and accuse people of basically inciting a hate mob without any evidence , purely on their political affiliation ? 
  there were dozens of other people who knew about the bus and dozens of other ways they could have learned about it . 
  there are some politically persecuted groups in morocco that would qualify for asylum , gay people for example . 
  but something tells me that most moroccans in europe are n't gay . 
  considering that it causes the killing of millions of male chicks a day , i 'm pretty sure there are people who do n't want people sexing animals . 
  the schwebebahn works in wuppertal because it has a few unique-ish features . 
  wuppertal grew out of multiple smaller cities/villages that merged over time . 
  all of them were along the wupper river , so wuppertal is very long and narrow . 
  since all of the sub-centers are along the river , a single track is enough to connect all of them . 
  building it above the river also saves a lot of precious inner city space . 
  for a long time , it was ( at least locally ) known for being `` the safest mode of transportation in the world '' , because it worked without a single fatal accident for 98 years . 
  this ended in 1999 , when a construction worker forgot to remove a steel clamp from the rail , causing one train to crash which killed 5 people . 
  thanks . 
  i really hope you find a place where you can be yourself . 
  i 'm guessing germany is n't your first choice , but let me know if you need help or information . 
  interesting . 
  i 'm sorry this is happening to you . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , do you have to hide your sexuality from everybody or are there places where you do n't have to hide ? 
  are you planing to leave some day ? 
  that 's awful . 
  are you still living in morocco ? 
  can we please stop implying that every time someone is outraged they are automatically calling for censorship ? 
  freedom of speech is about protecting your speech from the government , not from criticism . 
  quite the opposite , actually . 
  it 's there to guarantee your right to criticize me if i say something dumb . 
  even uncooked , i 'm * way * above average . 
  i do n't understand why this is n't higher up and why this appears to be controversial . 
  this is the only debate i 've seen so far that covers a wide spectrum of viewpoints without both sides extremes shouting down the moderates . 
  without the cooperation of turkey , the only way to stop the flow is to keep them in greece . 
  if we do n't want greece to die , we need to give them the capability to process the migrants and distribute legitimate refugees over europe . 
  to categorically be against distribution is a vote to kill greece . 
  basically all of continental europe uses the civil law system , which does n't really know binding precedents . 
  binding precedent is a common law thing ( us and most of the commonwealth ) . 
  someone should tell the skinhead neo-nazi groups that are attending their rallies in droves . 
   just because you wrote it [ ... ]  doesnt mean thats true . 
  you 're right , it does n't . 
  being the basis for every single european justice system makes it true . 
  you 're of course free to disagree with the principles , but do n't pretend that i 'm making this up as i go . 
   you seem to have lost all notion of justice , especially when it concerns the victims . 
  you keep telling me that my idea of justice is wrong , warped or twisted , yet have not provided your own definition . 
   you twist the justice the victims should receive into `` revenge and retribution '' . 
  you seem to be against my use of the word `` retribution '' . 
  maybe you should look up the definitions of those words . 
  the justice the victims receive through the * criminal * justice system * is retribution * . 
   yeah , yeah , start crying how that would be unfair to the poor murderers and rapists . 
  this is the problem with enacting harsher punishments . 
  even if it turns out that they are detrimental to society ( the evidence for which you keep ignoring ) , they never get repealed , because no politician wants to appear `` soft on crime '' and who wants to advocate for murderers and rapists ? 
  i did n't even do that . 
  i 'm arguing that a more lenient system is beneficial for society as a whole , something that is quite obviously true if you compare european and us justice systems , yet i am accused of putting the rights of the criminals before the rights of the victims . 
  i did nothing of the sort . 
   you are mixing revenge and retribution with justice . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i chose the words carefully . 
  justice , as practiced in modern states , is the institutionalized , fair and appropriate punishment of criminals with four goals : rehabilitation , deterrence , incapacitation and ** retribution ** ( not necessarily in that order of importance ) . 
  both retribution and revenge are acts of force against a criminal , in what is perceived as an appropriate punishment that fits the crime . 
  the difference is that retribution is impartial and has limits , while revenge is personal and potentially unlimited . 
  so retribution is institutionalized revenge that is compatible with the social contract . 
  calls for stronger retribution are motivated by a personal urge for revenge . 
  arguing against the rest of your post seems pointless , as seem to value retribution over everything else and . 
  from what i understand from your post , you seem to think that even the deplorable us prison system is still not harsh enough and therefore not able to work as deterrence , dismissing the findings of the meta study i linked that contradict that . 
  i do n't think we find any common ground to make an argument worth while . 
  sure , give me some time . 
  in the mean time , [ this ] ( http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/e199912.htm ) and [ this ] ( http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/deterrence%20briefing%20.pdf ) are a good place to start . 
  a `` lenient '' criminal justice system is n't a luxury that we treat ourselves to . 
  we do n't have low crime rates despite our system , but in part because of it . 
  every single piece of research we 've done on this shows very clearly that harsh sentences do n't help , but actually make the situation worse . 
  prisons do n't help people to become rehabilitated , they are crime schools and the longer the sentences and the worse the conditions are , the higher is the rate of re-offence . 
  harsher sentences also do n't work as a deterrence . 
  most criminals do n't do cost benefit analysis before committing a crime . 
  they do n't think about what happens if they get caught , they only think about the likelihood of getting caught . 
  a police force that is able to investigate crime effectively and reduced poverty are reducing first offender crime , comprehensive rehabilitation programs are reducing re-offence rates . 
  the only reason to be `` tough on crime '' is retribution , and it * actively working against an effective justice system * . 
  harming our system to satisfy our lower urge for revenge is in my eyes the ultimate defeat . 
  our system works for our citizens , i see no reason for why it should n't work for the immigrants . 
  the us does a lot of things well and europe can learn a thing or two from them . 
  their fucked up justice system and their reprehensible prison system are not one of them . 
  the extreme left mainly describes anti-authoritarian movements like the [ antifa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antifaschistische_aktion ) and some [ autonomist groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomism ) , most prominently the squatter movement surrounding the [ rote flora ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rote_flora ) in hamburg . 
  their violence is directed at right wing extremists and even more so , the police . 
  in ops link , they count 1.659 cases of left wing motivated violent crimes in 2013 , 877 of those are assault with bodily injury ( k\u00f6rperverletzung ) . 
  right wing extremists were responsible for 837 violent crimes , 730 of those were assaults . 
  i disagree with basically everything you 've said . 
   i feel that 's why your country is so fucked up . 
  this crisis is a huge problem , but germany is far , far away from being `` fucked up '' . 
  it 's still the 4th biggest economy in the world , the biggest in europe by far . 
  it 's by almost all objective or empirical measures in the top 10 of the best places to live and this crisis will not change that . 
  crime rates might go up a bit , but germany is still a very safe place , ahead of both the uk and france in the [ statistics ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/gmaps_rankings_country.jsp?indextoshow=safety&amp;title=2016 ) . 
  unemployment might go up a bit , but germany is currently tied with the czech republic for the [ lowest unemployment rate in europe ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:unemployment_rates,_seasonally_adjusted,_december_2015.png ) . 
  let me make this clear : these are big problems and they will have negative consequences , but they are far away from being catastrophic . 
   you do n't even allow hate speech neither does most of europe , including the uk .
