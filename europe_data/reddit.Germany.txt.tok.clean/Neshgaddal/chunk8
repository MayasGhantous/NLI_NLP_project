  it 's just circlejerking about how bad the other side is . 
  as much as i hate the current state of / r/europe , it 's still much better in that regard . 
   so , germany , pagan costume festival is coming up . 
  any dope bony minotaur or demon costumes planned ? 
  `` yeah , i 'm really in to straw this year ''  uh , like a straw beast , or a straw demon ? 
  `` na , just straw . 
  maybe some bells . 
  oh , and goats eating hats , that shit is hilarious . '', 
  i typed out a long response , but accidentally closed the tab . 
  now it 's gone . 
  you ca n't imagine how great it was . 
  you would have seen the light and become a bleeding heart liberal , just like me . 
  now i 'm tired . 
  maybe i 'll type it out again in the morning . 
  in the mean time , could you pretend that i presented long , well crafted rebuttals to all your points ? 
  here is a spoiler : [ dominionism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominion_theology ), 
  it 's not the right-wing part that 's problematic , it 's the echo chamber part . 
  i 've made a couple of comments about the refugee situation , a lot of them purely answering questions about the legal situation often with sources . 
  some are in the negative , but * all of them * are marked controversial . 
  people are n't just downvoting opinion that they do n't like , they 're heavily downvoting facts they do n't like . 
  could be worse . 
  / r/worldnews for example is unbearable . 
  it 's kind of the reddit way , though . 
  / r/politics has an equally strong bias . 
  yes , the new crisis is different than the last . 
  there are already twice as many people with probably more to come . 
  the composition of refugees is also different , but not * that * much . 
  ~ ~ there were also more males than females ~ ~ and there were also a lot of people from countries without war at the time . 
  `` wirtschaftsfl\u00fcchtling '' ( economic refugee ) is n't a new term . 
  this was discussed much in the 90s as well . 
  germany still has a lot of `` geduldete '' ( tolerated people ) from that time , which did n't qualify for asylum , but also could n't be deported for one reason or another . 
  but all that is somewhat besides my point . 
  i did n't say that this is n't a problem , nor that i think that everything will be alright . 
  i 'm * only * saying that family reunification is n't the problem people make it out to be . 
  people abusing the asylum system is the real problem . 
  my two previous posts are n't pro- or anti-refugees . 
  they 're pro-honest debate , which happens to be against a common right wing argument this time . 
  we can only solve this crisis if the two sides come together and find a reasonable compromise . 
  debating over things that are at best not * that * important and at worst straw men is actively working against that . 
  it 's true that i have a pro-refugee bias , but i do my best to be honest about my side and call out wrong or misrepresented arguments from the left side , too . 
  admittedly , i could do better in that regard , though . 
  people abusing the asylum process like the majority of people from northern africa and the now peaceful ex-yugoslavia * are * a huge problem . 
  one for which i do n't see an obvious solution . 
  working diplomatically with morocco and algeria so that they take back people who had their asylum denied is probably a good first step . 
  actually deporting people is probably the most important part as it will probably discourage people who have little chance to get asylum from even trying . 
  securing our borders sounds good on paper , but is much , much tougher than it sounds . 
  most people come via sea . 
  not only is that much more difficult to secure , we also legally ca n't just escort them back to their shore if we catch them . 
  it requires the cooperation of their country . 
  if they do n't cooperate , we have the option to let them drown ( which i hope i do n't have to argue against ) , or take them to our shore , which is what we are doing right now . 
  we * need * to find a solution with north africa . 
  just to add one little thing , since `` my side '' is often accused of censoring debate about it : i 'm absolutely not against criticizing islam . 
  radical islam is a huge problem , possibly the * core * problem in this whole mess ( it certainly is one of the main causes ) . 
  what i am saying however , is that i believe that it is n't necessarily something that is just inherent to islam . 
  for example in the us , half of all republican presidential candidates openly run on a platform of how gods laws are above american laws , yet you see very little of that in europe . 
  europe is build on secular values . 
  some denominations of christianity and judaism are also very much at odds with our values , although obviously not nearly as much as jihadi and wahhabi islam . 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  by `` point that out '' , i mean post and explain how they are wrong . 
  those are home lte plans , though , not mobile plans . 
  that is a possible backdoor that probably needs investigation , but again , that does n't seem to be that big of an issue when we look at the stats . 
  we had a very similar crisis about 25 years ago , when about a million refugees from ex-yugoslavia came to the eu . 
  if your proposed route was a big issue , we 'd see much higher family reunification stats in sweden . 
  and granted , they are higher relative to the population , but they are still pretty low in absolute numbers , with about 20k a year total ( for all immigrants , not just refugees ) . 
  if that were really an issue , we 'd expect to see stats with higher absolute numbers than germany . 
  besides , germany does n't exactly hand out citizenship like candy . 
  you have to live in germany for 8 years ( 6 for refugees ) , you need to be independent of * any * government aid , need to be fluent in german , ca n't have any criminal record , swear allegiance to our constitutional values and pass a citizenship test that tests you on law , values and history . 
  if you manage to do all that , you 're german in my eyes and are welcome to bring your wife and kids , so that you can try to make them german too , on the condition that you can provide for them .

  people seriously underestimate how difficult it is to get through the family reunifaction process . 
  at least in germany , it 's only for spouse and kids under 18 , no parents , no siblings . 
  you have to have a stable job , earn enough to provide for them and a large enough house or flat to house them . 
  we had a few refugee crises in the last century and we have the empirical data from that . 
  it 's no where near doubling or even tripling the people like some suggest . 
  it 's actually closer to a 10 % increase .

  edit : can someone explain to me how this post is controversial ? 
  it contains no opinion , only facts with an official source . 
  if you think those facts are wrong , feel free to point that out . 
  i 'm still having a hard time seeing their side ( the refugees , not the aliens ) . 
  could you try to put it into perspective ? 
  that makes sense . 
  i mean , i would be happy if it did work like i hoped , but it would probably quickly result in higher plan costs for eastern europe . 
  although that sometimes seems to be the european way , i do n't want to profit of the back of my eastern european union mates . 
  2-3 gb for 10 $ is still better than my current plan , though . 
  ok , so if roaming charges get banned next year , can i get a romanian mobile plan with like 30gb lte traffic for 10 $ and use it in germany ? 
  i think he means that the people who are leaving are mostly well-educated , leaving those without those skills behind , not that most muslims are well-educated specialists . 
  that kind of makes sense , since those well-educated specialists will have a much easier time finding a new job in another country and actually have the funds necessary to move . 
  it probably starts with googling `` hvor har du spr\u00e6ngstoffer ? '', 
  there 's nothing wrong with criticizing people on your side . 
  in fact , i 'd say that it 's actually * more * important to criticize your own side than the opposing side . 
  calling out your side for their bullshit makes the debate more honest and shows that you have integrity . 
  you just need to make sure that they are worthy of criticism ( which in this case , they 're not ) . 
  maybe they 're doing you a favor . 
  as a left leaning person , i 'm much more sympathetic to your side after reading all these responses condemning pegida . 
  a reasonable compromise can only be reached by the sane people of each group . 
  the sooner each side stops fighting the straw men they build of the other side and starts distancing themselves from their extremists , the faster we can actually have a constructive debate . 
  people come from austria to germany by boat ? 
  people are probably going to be pissed if frontex starts turning the bregenz-lindau ferry around and escorting them back to the turkish shore . 
  ok , so i take that as you giving up because you did n't expect to be challenged on the bullshit claim you simply made up .
