  source : been there , done that . 
  run bro . 
  run before you 're accused of being a gay nazi spy and get paraded around . 
   then we 'd have a tank per person and homelessness would be solved . 
  that 's a nice concept . 
  like a trailer home , just more badass . 
  honestly , i would n't enlist . 
  if shit goes south , i might go back to the red cross , get a basical medic traning and then work in a hospital , but that 's about it . 
  on a battlefield i 'd be little more than a millstone around everyone 's neck . 
  is that official policy ? 
  responding to non-nuclear warfare with nuclear strikes ? 
  imma put on all three sweatshirts my mother knitted for me - bring it on , winter !, 
  you do n't often see soldiers refusing orders because of moral or strategic concerns . 
  from what i 've heard so far your basic training as a soldier is there to get rid of such thoughts asap . 
  yea , well , should have kept carthago as a colony instead of razing it ... or even better , keep it as a rival to battle every few dozen years . 
  would have kept the roman empire on its toes and maybe prevented the dark age . 
  if so , it is n't expressed nearly often enough . 
  actually , i have thought about completely leaving church because of the utter fucking bullshit that comes from `` christian '' groups such as wbc and the likes . 
  i only have n't because i support the current pope 's course and leaving now would not help anything . 
  instead i apologise to gays and other people who are being discriminated against and hope they will not judge all christians by those hate-filled bigots . 
  nope . 
  / u/norrisobe explicitely refers to european muslims . 
  domestic islamophobia might have driven a few hundred of those to fight with isis , but the majority of them are not from here . 
   `` i am a jew when synagogues are attacked , '' said mazyek . 
  `` i am a christian when christians are persecuted for example in iraq . 
  and i am a muslim when firebombs are thrown at their places of worship '' kudos to that guy . 
  personally , i would have agreed with your statement about a year ago . 
  but since then i have worked for the red cross , worked with paramedics and nurses , basically with professionals who have seen people die in every degree of messiness . 
  they all ( or , iirc , more than 3/4 ) agree that they do n't want to be kept alife by some machine . 
  so this guy might not be in vegetable condition , but doctors have attested to his suffering , as the article says . 
  so yea , it 'd be a mercy to allow him to commit suicide , and there are basically no practical reasons not to . 
  relevant user name , i suppose ? 
  just put underpants on your head , you 'll feel an immediate surge of power and courage !, 
  man , they should totally host a contest on what to display on the new flag . 
  i 'm not even scottish , but i 'd come over and vote for a dragon . 
  if i ever went on a demonstration against these guys ... would you be ok if i printed this out in din a0 and carried it with me ? 
  would you mind to xpost to / r/esa ? 
  i really like your flair . 
  sorry , not `` you '' but `` the commanders of ukrainian government forces '' . 
  that shitty burned down region features a big part of ukraine 's industrial potential . 
  and while vast parts of the cities may have been pretty much leveled , there 's probably still enough value left for russia to make a profit with that invasion . 
  and i do n't want to see that happen . 
  so you can just say `` fuck everything , they 'll hate us either way , let 's raze the town before we gtfo '' ? 
  nope , but with all those civilians who 're not really involved . 
  on the other hand , a `` scorched earth '' strategy goes a long way to prevent reconciliation . 
  more like 75 , which is a a lot but not unreasonable . 
  you ca n't be arrested for doing something in a land where that 's legal . 
  so until other european countries follow suit , you 're right . 
  but that law does n't aim to make life more difficult for those who are already gone far enough to travel abroad to spread their propaganda . 
  it 's targeted at `` armchair extremists '' if you permit the neologism . 
  those who support that bunch of ruthless barbarians , but would n't want to get their hands dirty themselves . 
  well , we could post facebook statusses and tweets supporting the airstrikes . 
  deal ? 
  maybe merkel herself will publicly congratulate the participants , though that 's unlikely seeing how she was scolded for saying she 's `` happy '' about bin laden 's death . 
  you 're waking sleeping dogs , dude ... 
  i do n't mind if the space endeavour uses politics to its progress . 
  the other way round makes it bad . 
  it 's disgusting that the space endeavour - the only way humanity can survive on the * really really * long run - is being made a plaything of worldly politics . 
  if there had been a `` cunt '' or `` dinkum '' in there i 'd have assumed you 're an australian under false flag . 
  ok , but the bild is pretty much toilet paper to anyone who 's not ... er ... how to put it ... proletarian ? 
  yea , but that kind of media strategy - fabricate as many lies as possible , do n't care about being exposed - only works when the general population has a certain mindset . 
  most people would start doubting the objectivity of a news corp who have been caught lieing all too often . 
  but not in russia . 
  so what do we learn from that ? 
  aunt merkel 's phone bill is the highest . 
  the conservative bloc of the european parliament tend to stick together even if it 's about autocratic maniacs such as orban or political clowns like berlusconi . 
  like ... that we 've got today in germany ? 
  politically nice , but horribly inefficient . 
  with the inclusion of stuttgart area to greater bavaria , there 'd be a massive industry cluster . 
  misunderstood good guy putin . 
  his icbm 's are actually just meant to bring us pretty pictures of earth from space , like the v2s . 
  yea ... and please take the bavarian part of swabia , too !, 
  fucking napoleon , putting us with those \u7530\u820e\u8005 !, 
  i guess he simply did n't travel to swizerland so far . 
  * checks googlemaps * swizerland has n't been eradicated yet ... 
  so probably no . 
  ... i 'm pretty sure that vid landed me on some lists ...

  * `` liberation from gay nazi fascist scum day '', 
  that was n't as bad as expected . 
  actually , yes . 
  i was n't a very vocal supporter , but the thought that my government became complice of a criminal by purchasing those cds kinda frightened me . 
  it was yet another incursion on a seemingly sacrosanct concept . 
  if our government goes hard on banks , how long will the professional discretion of lawyers , doctors and priests prevail ? 
  are there pro-putin-brigades on / r/europe ? 
  god damnit , rick roll 'd again . 
  i love how the swiss do n't take crap from the us just because they 're the us . 
  was n't it swizerland that issued a warrant of arrest for george w. bush after his book in which he practically confessed to ordering torture ? 
  ... which is why we should go back to living in family-tribes ruled by chieftains . 
  it 's the only form of government with biological legitimation . 
  ^ ( not really my opinion ), 
  i disagree . 
  humans in general are incapable of closely working and living with more than ~ 20 people . 
  we need to reinstall a chieftain-system . 
  this is the most normal form of government and the only one which can claim biological legitimation . 
  ^ ( not really my opinion ), 
  europe , however , has seen its fair share of migration periods . 
  genetically , there are not really big differences anymore . 
  culture is more of a regional thing . 
  and separate languages are only a result of state borders ( got no citation for that one ) .
