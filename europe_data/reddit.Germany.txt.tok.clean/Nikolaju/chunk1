yeah , it 's the third top post . 
  i stumbled across [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vbtyt3h.png ) some time ago . 
  just a normal day in the youtube comment section . 
  there 's an anti-alcohol campaign going in on right now ( mostly just placards ) and i hope it 's successful ( maybe the article already documents the first success ) . 
   there is no `` origin '' of time you can refer to when naming cities . 
  even constantinople was n't `` originally '' constantinople . 
  i already said that the city is called wroc\u0142aw now . 
  why are you continuing this aimless quarrel ? 
  it 's still called breslau in german but this is n't a german-speaking sub , so it would n't make sense to use the german name . 
  istanbul was constantinople before it was called istanbul . 
  wroslaw was called breslau before it was called wroclaw . 
  there is no `` origin '' of time you can refer to when naming cities . 
  even constantinople was n't `` originally '' constantinople . 
  it 's just that in english these cities are called istanbul and wroclaw are called istanbul and wroclaw , even though they were not called like these at some point in time . 
  that time is over . 
  i also think that the `` group of gay piggy banks trying to flex their muscles '' allegory in the original cartoon was meant to stand for the russian perception of europe as very rich , but gay and weak . 
  i 'd take being rich as a compliment . 
  whoops , i actually did n't know that . 
  that 's kinda embarassing . 
  austria is neutral , that 's why they 're not in nato . 
  finland is not neutral but joining nato would indeed be incredibly dangerous . 
  edit : so apparently finland is neutral . 
  it 's kinda embarassing i did n't know that . 
  they are declining because it 's now harder to come here ( luckily ) . 
  `` willkommenskultur '' is an empty word and a strawman . 
  please , do n't . 
  op works in a hospital . 
  i was trying to be funny . 
  i obviously failed . 
  jokes aside : those three cities ( gda\u0144sk , wroc\u0142aw and bydgoszcz ) are actually really beautiful and tourists should definitely visit them if they come to poland . 
  the poles did a good job rebuilding them . 
  they also take much better care of them than the russians do with kaliningrad . 
  the russians destroyed kaliningrad and built ugly communist block buildings instead . 
  the poles on the other side were much more careful . 
  they rebuilt the cities , they kept the churches alive instead of detonating them . 
  they have great respect for the cities ' history . 
  i 'm not angry . 
  all schengen citizens can visit them and they are beautiful again . 
  what the russians did with kaliningrad is much worse . 
   it 's like calling istanbul constantinople . 
  i actually know greeks who do that . 
  danzig , breslau and bromberg are actually breathtakingly gorgeous . 
  it 's a shame they have been ethnically cleansed of their original population and resettled by poles but i guess we 're not really in a position to complain after we killed off 17 % of your population and reduced warsaw to rubble . 
  / u/ladadas gave a source , you did n't . 
  who am i gon na believe ? 
  that 's extremely positive for her in comparison with other european leaders . 
  in july hollande had [ 12 % ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-21/hollande-popularity-drops-for-third-month-nearing-record-low ) support cameron had [ 34 % ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/new-poll-shows-cameron-less-popular-than-corbyn-for-first-time-a6974891.html ) in april . 
  not really anything political , it 's more that if you would tell an 18th century german that there 's this musician from salzburg , they 'd probably say something along the lines of `` is n't that around bavaria ? '', 
  yeah , archbishopric . 
  and salzburg was part of the [ bavarian circle .

  that 's a pretty good answer and it 's very different from the smug `` see japan '' of before . 
  i would definitely support reducing immigration from the middle east to a very small number of high-skilled immigrants . 
  i 'm not a leftist by any means and i 'm not particularly fond of immigration but at some point you just got ta admit that things just are n't that easy . 
  you ca n't just press a button to be another nation that had a completely different post-war history . 
  both hungary and poland have crime rates that are extremely similar to germany 's btw . 
  so just press the `` be japan '' button . 
  how easy . 
  just say `` japan '' and the problem is solved . 
  berlin cathedral was indeed originally catholic but brandenburg was one of the first german lands to convert to protestantism . 
  nothing is left of the catholic church . 
  the building as we see it today was built from the 17th to 19th century , destroyed in the war and rebuilt . 
  it 's an actual case of protestants going overboard with excessive ornamentation . 
  it 's rare but it exists . 
  hesse ( grand duchy , grandducal motto ) before wwi had * `` gott , ehre , vaterland '' * - god , honour , fatherland . 
   b\u00f3g , honor , ojczyzna ( god , honor , fatherland ) [ plagiarists ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/wappen_deutsches_reich_-_grossherzogtum_hessen.png )  gott , ehre , vaterland ( god , honour , fatherland ) was the motto of my homestate hesse before wwi but it 's such a random collection of patriotic buzzwords that it 's not very surprising to see that other nations have it , too .

  looks beautiful . 
  \\  sees satiric map \\  o no it has something to do with russia \\  must be slavophobia \\  i must make a wall of text of whataboutism making unsourced claims full of ideological buzzwords \\  europe literally fascist you are not allowed to create a piece of satire that is not 100 % positive towards a russian politician because not praising one specific russian politician is fascist and btw what about colonialism and these things i just made up ? 
  wow , you are * seriously * butthurt . 
  we had countless of these maps here . 
  would you accuse someone of being `` germanophobe '' and create a wall of text if there was a piece of satire about merkel ? 
  and what has 19th century colonialism to do with putin ? 
  what is it with the whataboutism and russian nationalists ? 
  why does a satiric map make you feel like creating a list of every major european nation and their alleged deeds ? 
  every country has its stupid nationalists but only russian nationalists and almost all russian nationalist have this obsession with whataboutism . 
  where does that come from ? 
  why did you remain a republic ? 
  cause that title is so cool !, 
  even spain got their king back in the 70s . 
  you can do it , too . 
  it would also fix the terrible republican flag . 
  the winners had two premises : - self-determination of nations - fucking over the losers . 
  since austria and hungary were both losers they could follow the first premise without any problem . 
  the burgenland was ethnically german so it was made part of austria . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant . 
  open borders have always been important for european integration and peace . 
  there 's a reason so many eu projects are named after charlemagne . 
  can someone explain what i 'm looking at ? 
  there * was * a certain central european power that played a role in 20th century european history , and during the first half it was n't for the better . 
  kurds live in europe the same way turks live in europe : either in european turkey or as immigrants . 
  `` european '' languages do not exist , kurdish is an indo-european language . 
  most speakers of indo-european languages live outside of europe while many europeans do n't speak a indo-european language . 
  neither to `` mongoloid '' languages exist . 
  turkish is a turkic language . 
  wow , that acc is desperate . 
  kurdish is a indo-european language . 
  kurds do n't live in europe . 
   although i have n't heard germany complain about that one yet .
