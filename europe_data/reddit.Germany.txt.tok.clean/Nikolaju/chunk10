  similar : [ the kaiser wilhelm memorial church ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/ged%c3%a4chtniskirche1.jpg ) in berlin . 
  it was donated a cross of nails made out of coventry cathedral nails by coventry cathedral . 
  i think it 's somewhat simplistic to reduce their success to `` the opposition is evil '' . 
  people do agree with pis ' policies , poles vote for them for a reason , not just because of po . 
  well this was 18th century politics and constitutions were a radical new thing . 
  there 's also sorbian depicted in germany , despite being a minority language . 
  it 's just a way to depict languages , that 's all . 
  take some time to learn it . 
  really , i can only recommend it . 
  learning a new script is fun and the feeling you get when you begin to see what 's written instead of funny glyphs is great . 
  it 's like the first time getting glasses . 
  it 's missing kongolese belgium . 
  [ we used to fight the world together and win :\\ ( ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/sevenyearswar.png ), 
  honestly , most of those would probably work . 
  ireland , wingland and scotland for sure , i 'd live in great bavaria which would be almost exclusively german-speaking and include the richest areas of germany . 
  `` lombardia '' would be fucking glad they do n't gave to drag the south with them . 
  russia sent conscripts to combat in the first chechen war , which sparked protests . 
  afaik , the government has refrained from doing this since then . 
  every loss of life is terrible , but it 's even more terrible when people are involved involuntarily . 
  sending conscripts to combat would enrage russian moms . 
  no , most likely not conscripts .

  i visit my granny every second summer , the combination of heat and humidity can be terrible . 
  same here .

  / u/springinberlin , is that you ? 
  we on the other side do n't have funny hats and we do n't have swords but our honour guard has one of the [ best military bands of the world ] ( https://youtu.be/cgixb-akz-y?t=1m ) ( no joke , it 's actually renouned ) . 
  compare that to [ the italians . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/3x9p9wdm6ya?t=32s ), 
  well , this is about a tram between alsace and baden , a region torn by wars that had very much to do with nationalism . 
  the steel crown has a great history but it just feels out of place in a republican coat of arms . 
  get the king back for all i care , but as it is now it just bugs me out . 
  what do you expect , it 's from a troll acount called `` historythief '' that i have tagged from one of his first comments . 
  / r/europe seems to love him , though . 
   you have nothing to lose that 's so wrong . 
  nor in hesse .

   even us has better index that 's not necessarily a bad thing , the us has a pretty good index . 
  you 're on a level with italy , that 's not so bad . 
  i was hoping for a good analysis of putin 's rise . 
  instead i got this ideologally motivated , agenda-pushing unsourced shit . 
  come on , guys . 
  it 's an interesting topic and it deserves to be treated correctly . 
  this is rubbish . 
  my local news paper has had an article on this day almost every year . 
  the other paper i read ( faz ) had a tiny article on it today . 
  the tagesschau might mention it today . 
  the topic was huge of course when the bundestag recognized the genocide a few months ago . 
  every day is the anniversary of a terrible thing and if all mainstream media would report expansively on every single one , every year , there would be little left . 
  more like history class .

  is it the small german minority who say this , people from schleswig-holstein or germans in general ? 
  how to not offend brits : do n't confuse the uk and england . 
  england has no devolved government , so there is no such thing as an english government . 
  95 % percent of voters vote for other parties . 
  that 's like saying 64 % ( almost a supermajority ) of voters laugh at the cdu . 
  does it play such an important role in your life ? 
  as long as the economy is doing okay and there 's no war or anything it does n't make a huge difference for quality of life . 
  oh god no, 
   nah , we germans laugh at the fdp too . 
  political opponents do . 
  `` we germans '' have differring opinions on things . 
  hesse has been good since the beginning of time, 
   `` but what 's most encouraging for me and keeps me in good mood is that i am an honest german . 
  - letter from 29 . 
   `` if germany , my beloved fatherland , which as you know i am proud of , will not accept me , by god 's name , france or england has to be enriched by one skillful german , to the german nation 's harm . '', 
  - mozart on 18 . 
   `` i am only sorry that i am not staying here to show him that i do not need him - and that i can do so much more than his piccini - even though i am only a german . '', 
  from a letter from 11 . 
  september , 1778 that does n't necessarily mean much , though . 
  18th german identity is not the same as today 's german identity . 
  there was no country that was literally called germany but the concept did exist at the time and mozart did proudly call himself german . 
  the comparison with oscar wilde is n't great . 
  you definitely were at some time . 
  germans like to think the same . 
  19th century nationalist ernst moritz arndt ( the guy who wrote `` was ist des deutschen vaterland ? ), 
   we are placed at the center of europe by god , we are the heart of our world , we are also the center of the new history and of the church and of christianity . 
  even though he was not a very nice person ( hated jews , french and poles , his most famous work is literally titled `` on popular hatred and the use of a foreign language '' ) he was very influential in 19th century germany . 
  and my hometown frankfurt takes pride in calling itself the center of [ germany and europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7zhoixw67s ) ( nowadays the ecb is also located here ) . 
  lord of kaleva and the north definitely refers to the two kingdoms of kalevala . 
  sounds nice , does n't it ? 
  i definitely would like a fellow hessian in such a prominent position . 
  less than 1 % and i 'm not sure they would have guessed it 's a germanic language . 
  i always thought it was about a fisher 's son called fritz . 
  i still think that . 
  [ north vs south ] ( https://youtu.be/wdwn5iweskg?t=7m56s ), 
  i 've always liked the combination of fireworks and every church sounding its bells . 
  gott lluck sleeping with that . 
  we were told carrying more than 10 % of your weight on your back was unhealthy . 
  which was a joke , at that time ( elementary school ) i weighed about 30kg and had to carry about 10kg . 
  in german , too . 
  probably also a few other languages . 
  i think the average european knows as much or less about venezuela as the average american . 
  it 's a self-described socialists state and very authoritarian , i guess ? 
  it 's going through some upheaval right now . 
  it 's one of like 11 nations that were explicitly ok with the russian annexation of crimea .
