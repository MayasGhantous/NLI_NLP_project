  most eastern european leaders are opposed to immigration . 
  orban is just a particularly undemocratic one . 
   voting rights and ability to participate in politics of a country you 've never set a foot in is moronic and i really struggle to find any positives . 
  it 's handy if you have large number of people that have an ethnic/cultural connection to your country who live outside of your country because of historical reasons ( germany and hungary for example ) . 
  imagine there would be czech-speaking czechs living in silesia who were cut off from czechia when prussia conquered silesia and would n't have any minority rights in poland . 
  would n't you want to give them the right to aquire czech citizenship easily ? 
  you can also just change your voting laws - in germany you have to be a german citizen and need to have lived in germany for at least 3 months immediately before the election to be able to vote . 
  so if you 're an american who got german citizenship through their grandparents you ca n't vote here if you do n't live here . 
  many people want to make it illegal because it hinders integration and binds immigrants to their mother country ( as with turks who vote erdogan while living in austria ) . 
  i actually know an ethnic hungarian from zakarpattia . 
  he has n't made use of his right , though . 
  would n't that mean tens of millions of irish-americans are eligible ? 
  it was very handy for us in the later cold war and the 90s when a lot of ethnic germans ( several millions ) from eastern germany and the soviet union came to germany . 
  so i think at least for us it 's been a good idea . 
  and you have to be able to speak german anyway ( at least now , that 's not always been the case ) . 
  if you aquire german citizenship you usually have to renounce your old citizenship so we do n't have that problem at least . 
  eu citizens are an exception but most sp\u00e4tauswanderer do n't come from eu countries . 
  ach so , ja . 
  puff pastry filled with meat ( preferably lamb ) , onions , and other things . 
  at least that 's the non-sacrilegious cariant . 
  [ no , burek is this . 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b9/3c/db/b93cdb3b5e44476147938f6014cf1321.jpg ) and it 's just not burek if you add cheese to it . 
  imagine pizza hawaii in italy . 
  serbia says `` burek with cheese '' . 
  i feel terrible just typing that . 
  one of the most contentious topics is that [ serbs and croats do terrible things to unsuspecting burek ] ( https://i.reddituploads.com/20b14d1067614c53bcf28522b53c2432?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=e22dc5d190530b34b3c84191d87093aa ) and bosniaks ( and bosnians in general ) just can not stand for this . 
  no , it 's just that i did n't expect that and i 'm amazed there are still comunities where children grow up with alsatian . 
  do other french gypsies also speak minority languages like occitan , catalan or breton ? 
  frankfurter, 
  oh , they actually speak alsatian ? 
  discussions about this topic get incredibly toxic no matter where or when . 
  and there have been so many of these toxic discussions , it 's so tiring . 
  if you wan na hear my opinion , i think we have taken too many refugees and other mena migrants already in the past few years but i do n't want to start a discussion because of my experience with discussions on this topic . 
  it does seem like a poorly veiled attempt at trolling . 
  it 's just that there 's no way this is going to turn out well . 
  oh no not again, 
  [ you can actually . 
  ] ( https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/renunciation-of-citizenship.html ) an incredibly stupid idea . 
  the eu has no joint policy on stateless people and most states have no framework to effectively deal with statelessness . 
  stateless persons are held in immigration detention for long periods -- sometimes indefinitely -- simply because there is no country to return them to . 
  you can try going through the normal immigration process of a european country which is not easy/impossible without any papers . 
  tl ; dr : it 's a really shitty idea . 
  ah , it 's basically cheating because i know another slavic language . 
  the great dictator ? 
  edit : it 's the funniest joke in the world . 
  hello mom , weekend at the sea was super . 
  in france and spain many gypsies are sedentary and very well integrated , you just might not recognize them as gypsies . 
   to top it all off , serbo-croatian was the name of the language serbs used to push their agenda about all south slavs actually being serbs so it 's very weird to name the language group like that , kinda still pushing the agenda . 
  it should be said that other linguists also speak about `` serbo-croatian '' , not just serbians . 
  it 's really just croatian linguists who are in the minority here and see some serbian conspiracy ( which does n't make them wrong or anything , just a minority , there 's no definitive answer here ) . 
  the deutschlandlied refers to the idea of germany without referring to an actual state . 
  maybe that 's the reason it 's our official anthem . 
  wacht am rhein refers to no specific state , either . 
  the song is based on an older song named `` ich lebte einst '' , maybe it 's possible to go around the law through this . 
  [ oh deutschland hoch in ehren ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovmhqvggqg ) [ ich hab mich ergeben ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfop1y5igmg ) [ die wacht am rhein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0irtf4zk0tg ) [ was ist des deutschen vaterland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohhxc5x6pjy ) [ kinderhymne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0skw6zrgem ) ( not sure if you can call it patriotic but it has its fans ) a personal favourite of mine : the hymn [ nun danket alle gott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_a20qxy14s ) with a touching background story ( that probably never happened ) [ my favourite regional anthem , the anthem of the bergisches land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qzp5gf_r68 ) ... and much more but those are the ones i can recall right now . 
  also many , many military songs , hiking songs and drinking songs that i would n't call patriotic songs , even though some of them are more popular than the ones i listed . 
  amazing, 
  [ hey , we can do that better .

  i heard there are still some survivors left but i have n't seen any evidence of that yet . 
  if it 's just a bicycle tour i do n't see a problem . 
  did you grow up in germany ? 
  do you speak german ? 
  are you engulfed in germany society ? 
  no , they talked about their non-white friends . 
  to know if they 're european you have to to know them , a pic just shows a person . 
  not possible to say . 
  first one could be american , second one could be black french . 
  there are quite a lot of them and they 're mostly catholic and grow up unilingually french . 
  maybe none of them is french . 
  you ca n't tell , those are just pics . 
  there 's pretty much everything here , turkish names , chantalls and friedrichs . 
  i 'm not a federalist and that 's one of the things i really want to remain under the individual countries ' sovereignty . 
  countries should not be forced to let more or less people immigrate than they want . 
  that 's why i do n't like some recent developments in the eu . 
  i know four children named friedrich . 
  i 'm sure that 's statistically relevant . 
  it seems to me like there 's a lot of these names now but that could be an illusion . 
  ullrich , eduard , said friedrichs , frieda and greta are all people younger than me i 've met . 
   10 years ago we learned almost nothing about ww2 , never been to any kz . 
  very rare in germany . 
  rarely . 
  japan and south korea sometimes . 
  i think the canadian immigration system has been cited a few times . 
  [ this guy . 
  then prussia appeared , became germany and took alsace-lorraine which has been a part of germany until today ... - oh wait . 
  but then wwi happened and france famously lost ... 
  but then nazi germany happened and france got occupied and lost alsace-lorraine again which lasts to this day ... france is the only european country that already existed after the congress of vienna and has only expanded since then , while germany lost a third of its territory and russia lost many of its most valuable territories to ukraine and others . 
  the only thing they actually lost after 1815 is algeria and i 'll tell you , they did n't like that . 
  [ their territorial evolution speaks for itself . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/french_borders_from_985_to_1947.gif ) they 're pretty much the winners of the last 1000 years of european history . 
  do other countries have beamtenwitze , too ? 
  criminally neglected . 
  literally the only time the civil war was a topic during my school time was when we learned about a guy from our school who participated in the frankfurter wachensturm and then fled to the us to become lieutenant governor in some state and participate in the civil war as officer . 
  a very idealistic abolitionist , who liked the us because he wanted germany to become a democratic republic , too . 
  i think what i took from this is that german liberals sympathized with the north and some fought as volunteers . 
  japan did n't actually change their flag . 
  the rising sun flag was ( and still is ) their naval jack and war flag . 
   i thought it 's a desert wasteland with gypsies walking around like zombies sounds accurate .
