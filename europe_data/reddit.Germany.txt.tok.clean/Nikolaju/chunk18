  it also has lutherans , maybe i could find myself a congregation to fit in . 
  i liked connecticut very much when i was there ( though that does n't mean much , i 've only been to five states in my lifetime ) . 
  vermont republicans are n't so bad . 
  libertarians being yellow is standard in europe , as are greens being green . 
  what 's different is that leftists are usually red and conservatives are usually blue ( not in germany ) . 
  sounds pretty different to me . 
  i confuse poles with southern europeans sometimes but never with russians . 
  maybe it 's the vowels . 
  the way russians pronounce vowels is very distinct . 
  that 's an interesting question because it was already asked in / r/askanamerican and i 'm interested in how europeans will answer this differently than americans . 
   on a related note , you guys are weird for using those quote marks that start at the bottom . 
  it 's basically the same concept as with opening signs . 
  it signals that a quote is starting , not ending . 
   but how is calling for less immigration of specific ethnicity a hate crime ? 
  it is not . 
  did you read my comment ? 
   advocating for reduced immigration is n't punishable in any country , hate speech laws as they exist even in poland are about inciting hatred in a specific way . 
  just as the npd poster was n't critized on ground of immigration policy but on ground of inciting hatred against poles . 
  that was why polish newspapers were so outraged . 
  sure it is but there 's no cyrillic y in \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d . 
  the specific criticism was n't about immigration policy in general , it was about this speech and the way he conducted it . 
  of course germany also has the right to introduce border security or to leave the eu and schengen , we have no obligation to remain - again the criticism was n't about policy in general , it was about these posters which are essentially the same as wilders ' speech . 
  advocating for reduced immigration is n't punishable in any country , hate speech laws as they exist even in poland are about inciting hatred in a specific way . 
  listen to the speech and exchange moroccans with poles - would you still agree that this is 100 % unproblematic ? 
  remember [ this poster ] ( http://www.taz.de/picture/338679/948/npd-plakat_f.jpg ) in g\u00f6rlitz ? 
  polish newpapers were disgusted . 
  the government of saxony issued 400 anti-posters to combat these posters and blasted the polish anthem over public loudspeakers in g\u00f6rlitz . 
  the npd was reported several times for `` volksverhetzung '' . 
  to answer op 's question : the courts decided that this was no `` volksverhetzung '' , so that would be the case with wilders ' speech , too . 
  `` tschechei '' is pretty rare today . 
  i 've never heard it myself , only read it . 
  `` die mark '' is an example of why ukrainians do n't like the article . 
  their country 's name pretty much means `` mark/border region '' in russian , and if it 's used with the article it sounds like ukraine is the border region of a larger country - just as brandenburg is . 
  surprisingly not . 
  yes . 
  also to the `` krabat '' from the krabat story . 
  standard in germany . 
  i 've never heard it without the article . 
  [ this apparently . 
  ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=50.0&amp;d=48.4&amp;g=55.8&amp;s=58.3 ) not far from what i expected . 
  and it turned out to be right since the allies were pussies and just let him do it until he conquered poland . 
  that sounds pretty ideological for a history lesson . 
  anyway , half of europe did get enslaved by the soviets 20 years later . 
  during the seven years ' war prussia fought against [ this alliance ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/sevenyearswar.png ) and won enough battles to negotiate a status quo , thus getting to keep silesia . 
  it won against a vastly superior austrian force [ at leuthen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/schlacht_von_leuthen.jpg ) in silesia . 
  according to myth :  as the smoke cleared , the prussian infantry reformed its lines , preparing to pursue the fleeing austrians . 
  snow began to fall and frederick halted the pursuit . 
  a few soldiers , perhaps only one , started to sing a well-known chorale , nun danket alle gott ( now thank we all our god ) ; eventually the entire army joined in the song . 
  this is why the protestant chorale [ `` nun danket alle gott '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_a20qxy14s ) has somewhat of a special status and is often played at tattoos for example . 
  it was also played at the welcome ceremony for the last [ german pows returning ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/a_returned_german_prisoner_of_war_identified_this_woman%27s_son._he_will_never_return_because_he_is_dead._prisoners..._-_nara_-_541970.tif/lossy-page1-775px-a_returned_german_prisoner_of_war_identified_this_woman%27s_son._he_will_never_return_because_he_is_dead._prisoners..._-_nara_-_541970.tif.jpg ) from the soviet union [ in 1955 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/bundesarchiv_b_145_bild-107546%2c_k%c3%b6ln-bonn%2c_adenauer%2c_mutter_eines_kriegsgefangenen.jpg ) , ten years after the war ended . 
  not as rare as one might think , 
  wow what a novel idea, 
  how about mu isamaa on minu arm ? 
  maybe if you 'd just speed it up a bit ? 
  nice tune , but it lacks the history and importance of the current anthem which i think is the main reason anthems are selected for . 
  there has never been any censoring , it 's just that out of the stanzas of a 19th century song it 's the third stanza that is the official stanza now . 
  again , no censoring . 
  and the addition that it 's the third stanza that is official is pretty young ( from the 90s ) . 
  personally i like our anthem very much . 
  the tune , the history behind it . 
  and hands down , the third stanza is the best . 
  it makes no sense to sing the first stanza today ( from the maas to the memel . . wtf , why should we sing this , the poles would murder us in our sleep ) and the second one is just silly . 
  yeah some people have this biting reflex that forces them to say this when hearing anything about the lyrics . 
  even when it 's already been mentioned . 
  i like it , it 's simple and upbeat . 
  yeah , the tune is untoppable but the current lyrics are so primitive . 
  they should be rewritten one day . 
  not that people care so much about the lyrics anyway . 
  honestly , i think the history behind our anthem is too important to just incorporate any moderns songs with unfitting lyrics and a different tune . 
  if anything , i wish it would have become a popular patriotic songs after 1990 , but not the anthem . 
  remember that this is the current anthem of russia , and in russians it does bring back good memories to people because they were the masters and they liked it . 
  they 're not required to change it just because others do n't like it . 
  the most beautiful one ? 
  probably the [ alte oper ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/alteoper_ffm.jpg ) or the [ r\u00f6mer ] ( http://s1.germany.travel/media/content/staedte___kultur_1/staedte/frankfurt/g_130.jpg ) . 
  i 'm partial to the lesser known [ holzhausenschl\u00f6sschen . 
  oh god , so much to choose from ... basically the rest of the fucking city . 
  how about the [ tax office ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/franklfurt_oberfinanzdirektion_20100305.jpg ) ? 
  or the [ oberlandesgericht ] ( http://p5.focus.de/img/fotos/origs4649036/6078512380-w630-h472-o-q75-p5/urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-150429-99-11506-large-4-3.jpg ) ( supreme state court ) .

  [ western and central europe in general have some celtic heritage . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/celts_in_iii_century_bc.jpg ), 
  well , they used to speak alsatian until a few decades ago but that 's not necessarily easier to understand , even for other german-speakers . 
  a lot has been said about the germans ' fascination with russia , i just think they have an incredibly interesting and `` untypical '' history . 
  i just noticed that the lubusz voivodeship misses lubusz itself because it 's on the left ( german ) side of the oder . 
  [ also til that lubusz still exists , is called `` lebus '' in german and is absolutely tiny . 
  i genuinely like how the tories have accepted their insult and utilized it for themselves . 
  eh , putinversteher is very rarely used for rightwingers . 
  the afd has deliberately not made russia an issue because they know that a large part of their constituency are wessi conservatives who traditionally do n't think highly of russia . 
  it 's mostly used for die linke . 
  like our `` gutmenschen '' ( do-gooders ) ? 
  no , it 's banned . 
  but it has spawned several successor parties such as the dkp and the mlpd . 
  and in 1990 a new party called kpd was founded that is even more obscure and only has about 100 members . 
  drink a lot . 
  [ graduation hats used to be a thing but are n't anymore . 
  ] ( http://www.gymnasium-hechingen.de/sites/default/files/bilder/schulgeschichte/06_abiturjahrgang_1912.jpg ), 
  this happened with two parties immediately after the first bundestag elections : the sozialistische reichspartei ( srp ) , a fascist party , and the kommunistische partei deutschlands ( kpd ) , a communist party . 
  the stakes are very high , that 's why the npd has not been banned despite multiple attempts . 
  it 's not very much older tbf . 
  it * is * older which many do n't seem to understand .
