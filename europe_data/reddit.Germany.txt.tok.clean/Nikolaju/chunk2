  there are four direct successor states of the hre still existing ( germany , austria , luxembourg and liechtenstein ) and all of them used to be considered `` germany '' ( in the wider sense ) until not so long ago . 
  all of the later emperors were austrian and resided in vienna . 
  there 's really no reason to complain . 
  the regalia are right where they belong , in what used to be the most important german city for a long time , even germany 's quasi-capital . 
  they 're not stolen , they just have n't moved anywhere . 
  all of the later emperors were austrian and resided in vienna so it makes sense for the regalia to remain in vienna . 
  flair does n't check out . 
  seriously . 
  coastal elites at it again !, 
  does this work when the streetart is also depressing ? 
  so basically ancient czechoslovakia ? 
  why ? 
  i hated those `` dialogues '' . 
  they were n't even dialogues , just socrates rambling and some other guy inventing ver more weird ways of saying `` uhuh '' . 
   the slavs could also claim that they are direct descendants of greater moravia not uncommon in slovakia . 
  now , the trieste strip is visible . 
  the resolution is just not very high . 
  also `` back '' . 
   far more flags flying in gardens and such . 
  flags in gardens ( schreberg\u00e4rten ) are a long-standing tradition in germany , even in very leftist regions . 
  most participants had very wordly interests in that war . 
   luxembourg luxembourg had some major border changes in which they lost most of their land . 
  they kinda destroyed a third of all german towns and heavily participated in the thirty years ' war in which a third of the german population died ( about half of the male population ) . 
  the war was such a big clusterfuck though that it 's hard to blame anyone specific . 
  woosh fallacy, 
  they probably do ( reichsb\u00fcrger and the rest ) but luckily they 're few . 
  i was there two times in my life . 
  i absolutely loved it . 
  `` nachts ist es k\u00e4lter aus drau\u00dfen '' is a common anti-joke in germany . 
  phonetically spelling it out would result in something like `` sig '' because the e in sieg is silent . 
  the reason so many english speakers spell it seig is because ie is usually pronounced [ ai ] in english weil ei is pronounced [ i  . 
  wow they managed to finish a whole airport in their largest city ? 
  three even ? 
  i 'm unironically jealous right now . 
  i though that was red . 
  they are n't ? 
  why ? 
  the thing is that it 's not `` coming from a country '' but from a newspaper .

  a coat of arms is not defined by its design but by its blazoning - the blazoning of this german eagle is right .

  when comparing gdp per capita , adjusting for costs of living makes a lot of sense . 
  people in the region of former yugoslavia use their religion for identification reasons , even if they 're not religious . 
  serbians , bosniaks and croatians all speak serbo-croatian so religion serves as an identification factor ( orthodoxy for serbs , catholicism for croatians , islam for bosniaks ) . 
  oh , i do n't actually dislike berlin . 
  it 's just a copypasta . 
  it 's a dank copypasta from the german part of reddit . 
  we call them kopiernudeln . 
  seriously , try it . 
  the prince of prussia is the pretender to the throne of the kingdom of prussia , which covered more than half of modern germany . 
  he does n't claim any polish territory because he does n't need to do that just because prussia had territories that are polish now . 
  the belgians do n't have a problem with the dutch king calling himself king of the netherlands just because they used to be dutch . 
  there is no duke of alsace-lorraine and there has never been one . 
  french pretenders are active in france , not germany . 
  fair enough , i guess . 
  the current borders do have a historical precedent because they closely resemble the medieval borders before the hre conquered parts of poland . 
  gda\u0144sk was part of poland until the partitions and has obviously an importance in polish history . 
   only to gda\u0144sk pomerania and upper silesia . 
  is n't that pretty much what i mentioned ( pomerania and silesia ) ? 
  the only medieval polish regions that are n't included in this list ( * gda\u0144sk pomerania and upper silesia * ) are lubusz and lower silesia . 
  so like i said . 
  what is berlin ? 
  berlin is the city for which one has to be ashamed as a german on an international stage . 
  comparing berlin with other european capitals like london , paris , madrid or amsterdam would leave any decent man embarassed . 
  even small countries like austria , belgium or switzerland have international cities with high quality of life like vienna , brussels and zurich . 
  germany is cursed with berlin , the capital of failure . 
  berlin has the highest density of assholes of the entire republic . 
  deutsche bahn , the bundestag , air berlin and axel springer se are only a few examples of the incapable scum dwelling there . 
  the golden age is long gone by , this city is absolutely screwed . 
  the berliner as such is a lazy lump . 
  behaviour which would be considered pure laziness , unkindness , incompetence , dissocial personality disorder and stupidity in every civilized cultural circle , is quickly defended by berliners as berlin 's particular nature . 
  another central feature is the all-dominating inferiority complex . 
  that is why the berliner projects massive feelings of hatred onto anyone who is better than him in any way . 
  especially the south germans , who are superior to him in every aspect , are a thorn in his eye . 
  he begrudges their success and munich is on top of his hate list . 
  this city is everything and has everything the berliner wants to be and to have . 
  that munich is paying for the berliners ' dissolute lifestyle does n't cross the berliner 's mind , secretly he even believes he deserves it . 
  instead of ridding himself of his lethargy arising from envy and misfortune and turning his city around , he engages in asocial parasitism and still thinks higly of his alleged metropolis . 
  culturally berlin is rather weak , large achievements were long ago . 
  pronouncing the letter `` g '' as `` y '' is a great cultural achievement here . 
  some advanced students even manage the addition of a `` wa ? '', 
  to every sentence . 
  the performance in the kitchen is mediocre , to put it kindly . 
  a sausage of ground meat with ketchup and curry spice is sold as currywurst here and considered culinary genius . 
  no person with the least bit of common sense would think of a sausage with ketchup as the holy grail of culinary art , let alone a meal . 
  the rest of the republic in its generosity keeps the berliners in their ignorance so that their inferiority complex does n't become rampant .
