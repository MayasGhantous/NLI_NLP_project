  prussia proper is not in germany anymore , but most of the kingdom of prussia still is . 
  [ napoleon 's stepson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eug%c3%a8ne_de_beauharnais#/media/file:eugenebeau.jpg ) , usually considered the second most capable napoleon , was ruler of my hometown of frankfurt and prince primate of the confederation of the rhine . 
  [ luise of mecklenburg-strelitz ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/luise_von_mecklenburg-strelitz#/media/file:louise_of_mecklenburg-strelitz.png ) was queen of prussia and the mother of the first german emperor . 
  she had the `` luck '' of dying when she was still young and good-looking so she is widely remembered as such . 
  he 's the king of navarre that inherited the french throne and kept it for his successors . 
  he was very popular , there 's a song about him :  vive henri quatre  vive ce roi vaillant  ce diable \u00e0 quatre  a le triple talent  de boire et de battre  et d'\u00eatre un vert galant . 
   long live henry iv  long live this valiant king  this fourfold devil  with the three talents  of drinking , fighting  and womanising, 
  it just sounded weird to my ears . 
  only mentioning `` dialects distinct from standard french '' and then listing brittany , corsica and the basque country . 
  also trying to find a way around the ethnicity question . 
   a dialect distinct from standard french in case of brittany , corsica and the basque country it 's not just not standard french , it 's completely different languages . 
  honestly , i do n't see the problem with that . 
  many , if not most european countries just retained their traditional coat of arms and removed the monarchist bits when they became a republic . 
  it would make for a [ very simple and good-looking coa . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/archive/c/ca/20130209003814!arms_of_the_house_of_savoy.svg/1000px-arms_of_the_house_of_savoy.svg.png ), 
   obviously ireland is n't in the uk anymore but they never bothered to change the coat of arms . 
  they did n't change it because of northern ireland . 
  same reason the current union jack is still in use . 
  is the grand coa official ? 
  because i would imagine the use of croatia , transylvania , slavonia , dalmatia and fiume is somewhat controversial . 
  would n't just the cross of savoy in a shield be more minimalistic than the current soviet-style emblem ? 
  the vichy one is pretty trippy . 
  fried eggs , a lye roll with camembert and orange juice . 
  weekend \\ o /, 
  so , yeah . 
  the article forgot about the faroes and so did i. 
  [ ;\\ ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ex2uwog.png ) or did you mean the faroes ? 
  that seems to be what the entire discussion page is about . 
  ah , so it 's ye olde discussion about whether `` serbo-croatian '' is one or several languages ? 
  it attracts nationalists and ideologues from all respective countries and makes all articles about the topic huge slapfights . 
  almost as good as german wikipedia talk pages . 
  it 's not just europe btw . 
  kosovo is recognized by 111 out of 193 un member states and 3 out of 5 permanent sc members while northern cyprus is recognized only by turkey . 
  the cration of both countries was under very different circumstances . 
  denmark * is * the smallest nordic country . 
  iceland is more than twice as large as denmark . 
  the danish realm is larger , but that one has its own wikipedia article , while the article `` denmark '' is about denmark proper . 
  it 's the second most populous of the nordic countries but that 's obviously not what the paragraph is about . 
   for example the english page about the croatian language says that croats did n't exist at all until 150 years ago . 
  can you give a quote ? 
  i 'm interested how they want to justify that or if it 's just badly worded . 
  [ yeah ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/dialetti_e_lingue_in_italia.png ) , about [ that . 
  ] ( http://www.italymagazine.com/italy/christmas/italian-christmas-cakes ), 
  sure . 
  i do n't like to talk about politics with them , but they do . 
  i usually laugh and shrug it off . 
  it 's not something i want to waste my energy on . 
  not enough . 
  i 've visited almost every corner of hesse , but outside of that it 's just a few travels to the large cities ( berlin , munich , cologne ) , one time worms and one time black forest . 
  more like a couple decades back . 
  yes , and lower saxon is a dialect of dutch . 
  the border was not drawn along dialect borders , it was drawn along the outer borders of the medieval principalities that successfully revolted against the spanish . 
  if it comforts you , 500 years of separation have practically created a new language border . 
  the dutch lower saxons now sound very different from northern germans and the people who live in that `` south hollandic '' area mostly speak high german today . 
   would you disagree that the left has more traction than the right ? 
  yes . 
  in most european countries the fringe does not have a huge influence either way . 
   governments policing and censoring `` offensive '' language this is not an inherently `` far left '' thing . 
  it 's used excessively by the tories for example . 
   pro mass-immigration policies there 's disagreement on what `` mass immigration '' means . 
  no european government would say they favor `` mass immigration '' . 
   `` muh white guilt/diversity '' when has `` white guilt '' ever been a thing in europe ? 
  it 's very clear that do have a political opinion and a personal bias just like every redditor . 
  same for me , it would be presumptious to suggest otherwise . 
   limiting my mindset to what `` right '' is or `` left '' is supposed to be is something i do n't find appealing . 
  i do n't deal in partisan bullshit . 
  what if i told you that i think very similar , yet that does n't relieve me of criticism by others ? 
   they got waaaaay more traction than the far-right `` the far left has a large influence while the far left does n't '' is not only in the realm of opinions , as you just said , it also contradicts you saying that you do n't limit your mindset to what `` right '' is or `` left '' is supposed to . 
  it shows that you do 100 % think in these categories , that you identify people as `` far left '' others would n't and that you identify people as not `` far right '' others would . 
  you mean you feel like people should focus on falsely presented stories about the fringe groups you do n't like , instead of focusing on falsely presented stories about fringe groups you identify with ? 
  the far right does n't exist ? 
  calling other people nazis has been a stupid , but 100 % european leftist tradition for decades . 
  this does n't have anything to do with the us . 
   points out about the damage islam is doing as islamophobes this is a thing unfortunately , but i 've not seen in / r/askeurope yet . 
  could it be that the `` pointing out the damage islam is doing '' was done in an uninformed and angry way ? 
  in any case it 's not borrowed from the us , where the discussion about islam is a very recent thing . 
  of course , since it 's reddit you 're mostly dealing with young people who are mostly biased towards a young people , cosmopolitan viewpoint . 
  that 's not only the case here , but anywhere in reddit . 
  i went to a spanish language center nearby last bundestagswahl where they set up a polling station . 
  postal voting is possible , i know someone who only uses postal voting instead of going to a polling station . 
  i actually like the feeling of going to an `` official place '' to cast my vote . 
  schools are indeed pretty common places to set up polling stations . 
  we get a [ relatively uncomplicated ballot paper ] ( http://www.archiv-grundeinkommen.de/wahlen/buta09/bilder/wk16-wiest-1200.jpg ) with the names of the parties on one side for the half of the bundestag that is determined through proportional representation and the names of your local candidates one that other site for the other half that is determined by fptp voting . 
  you go to a private booth and tick two boxes , fold the paper and stick in the box . 
  you can do a til if you want . 
  it would be dishonest for me to do it and honestly somewhat embarassing - a european who has n't heard of a animal that is very widespread here . 
  it 's disputed whether they 're the same species ( english wikipedia says no , german wikipedia says yes ) but in any case they 're so similar that interbreeding with domesticated cats is a threat to the european wildcat population . 
   there was a huge cat problem - but that is domesticated right those are feral cats , i.e. 
  domestic cats that have gone feral ( called * wildlinge * in german ) . 
  they 're indeed a problem in many countries . 
  there are neutering programs for feral cats to reduce the problem . 
  they 're not even that rare . 
  they live [ all over the old world , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/wild_cat_felis_silvestris_distribution_map.png ) even though the european population is pretty low these days . 
  according to the iucn , their threat of going extinct is classed as * of least concern * . 
  they do exist in germany , which is pretty cool . 
  [ they look cute ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/european_wildcat_nationalpark_bayerischer_wald_02.jpg ) , but do n't be fooled by their looks . 
  they 're wild animals and have been proofed practically impossible to domesticate . 
  no , i mean [ wildcats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wildcat ) , not to be confused with feral cats . 
  they are the animals we domesticated to get domestic cats . 
  they do n't exist in the new world .
