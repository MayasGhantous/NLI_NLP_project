  [ they look just like normal cats , just with less colour and more stocky ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/european_wildcat_nationalpark_bayerischer_wald_03.jpg ) . 
  they also do n't behave like domestic cats since they are wild animals and no pets . 
  in germany there 's a bit of a discussion going on on whether it should be allowed to shoot intruding wildcats . 
  i 'm not sure , how common are real [ wild boars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_european_boar ) in the us ? 
  they 're everywhere here , in every forest and every city . 
  they 're dangerous and annoying , but their young are the [ cutest thing ever . 
  ] ( https://www.welt.de/img/regionales/stuttgart/mobile114978064/6181350007-ci16x9-w1200/frischlinge-im-schnee.jpg ) what i do know is that [ wildcats ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/felis_silvestris_silvestris_luc_viatour.jpg ) do n't exist in the us . 
  we have a lot of owl species that are only native in europe but most of them are [ just cute ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/waldkauz-strix_aluco.jpg ) , so i guess they do n't count as unusual , dangerous ior exotic . 
  when i was little my family regularly visited a wildlife resort nearby , so i 've seen my fair share of european bisons ( wisente in german ) . 
  beautiful animals . 
  fuck ticks, 
   as long as it 's not spoken in a strong local dialect depends on the dialect . 
  would n't [ low german ] ( https://youtu.be/ctluqxhyqdg?t=44s ) be more easy to understand than high german without a strong local dialect ? 
  legitimately curious since i 'm not dutch . 
  [ here 's the lyrics of the song i 've linked . 
  what does a coat of arms without an escutcheon even look like ? 
  all of it . 
  i do n't know why . 
  it 's one of the things i really do n't like about germany . 
   mostly in america ww1 is viewed as a mistake to get involved in same here, 
  why the downvotes ? 
  because of the snarkiness ? 
  that is legit the wet dream of german foreign policy ( and mine too :p ) . 
  the location directly next to brandenburg gate is highly symbolic - this is the place where the us embassy used to be before the war and the us really , really , wanted to relocate their embassy from bonn to this specific place . 
  problem was that they also wanted the security they were used to but the german government and the berliners did n't like the though of a lot of security directly on the pariser platz very much . 
  as a compromise , the us moved most of their staff to another building but kept the central building in berlin as the `` official one '' . 
  we have volkstrauertag ( people 's mourning day ) 14 days before the first advent . 
  it originates in the weimar republic and commemorates both soldiers and civilians who died in war , including victims of violent oppression . 
  well , it 's both romanticism , that 's all i know . 
  they have that realist touch to them that you do n't see in c.d. 
  friedrichs painting , though . 
   both religion and ethics is n't possible afaik . 
   thats always a good one did n't notice how that sounds . 
  [ maybe you 'll like this one .

   e.g. 
  the nazi-era was covered repeatedly in what way ? 
  we ( gymnasium in hesse ) did cover the nazi era , but specifically the role of the protestant church . 
  yes . 
  in most states schools will offer a catholic , protestant and an ethics class , though the ethics class is n't always granted . 
  it 's mandatory to visit at least one of these until graduation ( at least that 's the case in hesse ) . 
  as soon as you 're `` religionsm\u00fcndig '' at 14 ( i.e. 
  you have full control over your religions matters , can convert and everything ) you can leave the religious class , but you have to take ethics . 
  religion teachers are teachers like everyone else , so they 're appointed by the school/state , but they usually have a religious background ( being a priest or just having studied theology or something else ) . 
  both religion and ethics is n't possible afaik . 
  berlin is always that one guy in education matters , so who knows what they do , maybe a berliner knows more about his . 
  * protestant evangelicals are the weird subset of protestants that poisons us politics . 
  english latin and italian latin are exactly the same , though . 
  neither language used diacritics or extra letters . 
  \\  republic of ireland why, 
  really ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure there 's a ... [ larger and more widespread one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/russia-today-logo.svg ) in three languages . 
  german soaps for retirees are the worst thing we ever did . 
  only thing you could say about it is that it 's based around middle german and upper german dialects , leaving out low german . 
  which as a consequence kinda died out after the introduction of universal basic education . 
  well , you 're not over-the-top patriotic , too . 
  i like that . 
  it also helps that your national identity was formed only after the war and you 're able to blame unconvenient things on germany . 
  well , that 's another meaning of the word , too . 
  at least in german . 
  former german president johannes rau said at his inauguration :  `` i never want to be a nationalist , but definitely a patriot . 
  a patriot is someone who loves his fatherland , a nationalist is someone who despises other people 's fatherlands . 
  we on the other side want to be a people of good neighbours , in europe and the world . '', 
  `` nationalist '' in the sense of `` i love my country '' ( like patriot ) ? 
  because that sounds pretty tame for the kind of people calling themselves `` nationalist '' that i 'm used to . 
   do you think your country is `` great '' ? 
  it 's good enough for me   if so , do you think your people should be more proud of your accomplishments ? 
  sometimes i wish they would n't be so scared by outbursts of patriotism and develop some kind of everyday patiotism , not based on history or lost territory like our wannabe `` patriotic '' far-rights but on what we are and what we have . 
  do [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/menhir_du_champ_dolent.jpg ) [ here ] ( http://polpix.sueddeutsche.com/polopoly_fs/1.421098.1357626804!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/940x528/image.jpg ) pass as buildings ? 
  so [ this here thing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/karden_-_korbisch_2006-08-21_%282%29.jpg ) ( originally built in ~ 941 ) is the oldest german residential building that is still inhabited by normal people . 
  [ the amphitheatre in trier was built around 100 ad .

  i 'm partial to [ o fortuna ] ( https://youtu.be/pjnp5ukrtbq?t=2m10s ) from carmina burana in latin . 
  there are a few russian songs i love : [ kon ' \\ ( steed \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eonek7tjwec ) [ ah ty , step ' shirokaya \\ ( oh you , wide steppe \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybe1b7jhjf8 ), 
  we founded the illuminati , is n't that nice ? 
  there 's a lodge nearby from where i live . 
  they do galas sometimes . 
  nice people . 
  unfortunately many german edgelords are 20 + . 
  i know a few of them . 
  additionally , austrian nazis are still mostly german nationalists so this has still a certain slant . 
  if you meet an austrian that rants about the austrian nation being an `` allied conspiracy '' or something like that you can take a guess at his other views . 
  yeah , that 's because [ we do n't have many of them . 
  ] ( http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8306/7886244068_34b6a1e132_b.jpg ) never had , and those we had we brutally genocided in ww2 . 
  i love south german swearwords . 
  hearing a bavarian rant just makes me happy . 
  i 've never witnessed an austrian rant but i 'm sure they 're just a good at this . 
  it has nothing to do with communism , though , or does it ? 
  it 's just that roma mostly live in southeastern europe and these countries were communist between ww2 and the 1990s . 
  from my experience the city hate thing is almost purely a joke , the province-vienna hate is surprisingly real and the hate towards germany can be very real sometimes . 
  wow , that list . 
  who do you not hate ? 
  that 's unhealthy . 
  despite their turbulent history , germans do n't really hate any other country i could think of . 
  the us and russia are not very popular here in general , but people are n't very involved in that . 
  the only group that really hates other countries are neo-nazis who especially despise poland ( for the massive territorial losses and subsequent forced resettlement ) and france ( just 'cause ) , sometimes also russia ( for the occupation and for racist reasons ) . 
  they hate most immigrants ' home countries , of course ( turkey etc. ) . 
  luckily they 're rare .
