  * `` center-right ( sanders ) '' * is just removed from reality in most of europe . 
  nothing really , except for the memelland thing . 
  and the capital in geography class . 
  we had the jagiellons in history class but that was part of a special topic called `` polish history '' and until a few years ago i did n't even know the jagiellons had something to do with lithuania . 
   economic stance :  center-right ( sanders for the americans  moderate right ( hillary and the left of the gop ) come on , you know that 's nonsense . 
  i want to click center-right , but i have little in common with sanders . 
  he supports single-payer btw which is something most european countries * do n't have * so supporting it makes you a leftist in * most of europe . 
  do n't hit me but when i say `` central europe '' i usually mean germany , austria , switzerland , liechtenstein and sometimes ( rarely ) also the czech republic and slovenia . 
  i know central europe is more countries but i just ca n't get used to thinking of slovakia , poland or hungary as central european . 
  from a ( west ) german perspective where russia is on the other side of the world anyway these countries are the definition of `` the east '' . 
   because you hardly hear a familiar word while listening to asian speakers . 
  japanese and south koreans use a lot of english loanwords . 
  in germany english loanwords are also pretty common , especially with young people . 
   do you think that this downgrades the quality of the language ? 
  i do n't think there is such a thing as `` language quality '' or that it 's influenced by where a language 's words originate . 
  a few central asian nations allow pretty large nato bases on their soil ( and are close to nato in other ways ) while simultaneously maintaining good relations with russia . 
  i 'm not sure why they do this , could have something to do with that `` playing hard to get '' . 
  nato forbids the accession of countries with heavily disputed borders ( so you wo n't see kosovo or cyprus in nato in the foreseeable future ) . 
  things like these could seriously endanger the alliance .

  which cost a lot of money . 
  attitude = / = ir germany has done nothing against trump ( and i do n't think we should endanger our relations just because we do n't like trump ) . 
  the german unification did kinda kill off the low german language , though .

  it brings luck , they say .

  nrw has 17,84 million inhabitants and i 'm just kinda surprised .

  why are they on a different date ? 
  remembered in west germany as `` finlandization '' . 
  that 's the term conservatives used when they warned about getting too close to the east . 
  wow , did people in the proximity of st. petersburg between the city and estonia really still speak a finnic language just 100 years ago , long after the city was built ? 
  blows my mind !, 
  if that 's true , it 's a shame it 's all dead now . 
  it really illustrates how st. petersburg was artificially planted . 
  berlin-tegel does exist ( even if it 's far smaller than fraport ) . 
  why ? 
  we eath other schnitzels with sauce , not wiener schnitzel ( and we do n't usually call it tunke ) . 
  that said , schnitzels with sauce are definitely a thing . 
  additional pros : frankfurt also has a historical significance . 
  it was the place where the emperors were elected and later also crowned , and it was the center of the 1848 revolution with the frankfurt parliament . 
  it 's also richer than berlin . 
  additional cons : frankfurt is not a very beautiful city . 
  the east might feel neglected if the capital were in the west again . 
  it really was n't rigged because the rules were layed out before and all votes were fairly counted after a period of campaigning . 
  the way the two districts had to vote was obviously designed to give a small edge to the danish side ( which it did ) but the resulting borders are the closest you could get to fair borders . 
  no problem here . 
  keep in mind : this was in 1920 !, 
  using plebiscites for fairly determining national borders was almost unbelievable 100 years ago ( and it still is ) . 
  it 's absolutely awesome . 
   1920 plebiscite rigged !, 
  it kinda was , seeing as the north part voted as a whole while the municipalities in the south part all voted on their own which resulted in several cities voting for germany but ending up in denmark . 
  they could do it like hitler . 
  one of the first things he did was to make labour day an official holiday - one day later he outlawed all unions . 
  labour day continued to be the largest festival of the year and the de facto national day , just that it did n't focus on labour at all but on national `` heroes '' . 
  only thing i know about yorkshire is that it 's the largest county and that there are cute dogs named after it . 
  in fact , if i think about it , yorkshire is the only county i 've ever heard of . 
  i guess you could take that as a compliment . 
  eastern european nationalism is always a nice thing . 
  i think i know where that downvote comes from , 
  the reason is that the western allies were content with the first declaration of surrender but the soviets wanted another one with more important wehrmacht generals signing . 
  that second declaration was one day after the other one , but the surrender was already on force so it was more of a symbolic act . 
  it 's about rivalries and the balkans really take the cake in this category . 
  honestly , it 's really weird what they did there . 
  the regiment did n't even change its name until the dissolution of the wehrmacht in 1945 and the sole reason they chose it is because many of its officers participated in the july 20 plot - well after the machtergreifung , mind you , during the war , long after the armed forces were renamed to wehrmacht . 
  imo one ca n't just say `` we 're the successor of this specific regiment , but only until 1935 so we 're not the successor of the exact same regiment after 1935 . '', 
  considering the july 20 plot was later than that , i really do n't agree with that choice . 
  did n't know the gdr thing . 
  thanks . 
  i thought the wachbataillon abandoned bonn a while ago . 
  i ca n't find any reference to bonn , neither in the wikipedia article nor in the official site . 
   they have a ceremony when the representative of another country comes to visit the king every country does that . 
  some countries include their own traditions to the diplomatic ceremonies . 
  for example most slavic countries offer foreign representatives bread and salt . 
  i saw the livgarde a few months ago in copenhagen , loved watching the changing of the guards . 
  most countries have something like this . 
  for germany it 's the [ wachbataillon ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z91zf3a.jpg ) ( guards batallion ) , stationed in berlin and actually of regimental size . 
  they are the only german unit that officially continues the tradition of pre-frg units : they are the successor of the prussian 1 . 
  foot guard regiment and the infantry regiment 9 of the weimar republic reichswehr . 
  they look [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uko2nvd.jpg ) if the weather allows it and [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wd2uxny.jpg ) if it does n't .
