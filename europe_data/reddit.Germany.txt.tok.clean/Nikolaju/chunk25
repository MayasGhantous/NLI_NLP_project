  they perform ceremonial duties like the [ recent zapfenstreich on the occasion of president gauck 's farewell . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tilohznx_i ) while germany does have a central memorial ( the alte wache in berlin , which used to be guarded by policemen in the weimar republic , by ss-guards in the third reich and by the guard regiment in the gdr ) it is deliberately not guarded by soldiers , as it is supposed to be a civil memorial , not a military one . 
  also germany before the the revolution of 1918 . 
  sorry it 's just my personal bias . 
  i 've never been to estonia but my russian grandma loves to makes those dishes . 
  falukorv looks like [ gelbwurst ] ( https://estore-sslserver.eu/my-eshop.info/webroot/store28/shops/6dbfdf6c-578e-4890-9cbb-243e1c6eb432/56b4/bb2b/00f5/4a32/b7a9/0a48/3572/2d51/dsc_0067_m.jpg ) . 
  is it similarly tasty , unhealthy and chockful of ingredients that really should n't be there ? 
  i ate corn flakes for breakfast ( i 'm really trying to switch to something healthier but it all tastes so terrible ) , rice with chicken for lunch and nuremberg sausages with mashed potatoes for dinner . 
  one thing almost everyone seems to have eaten today is rice . 
  chicken or other types of poultry also seem to be very popular . 
  you know , until i clicked `` all comments '' i was sure you were russian from the food you described . 
  i like to walk to the rheingau . 
  it 's warm right now , it 's green , it 's full of castles and wine . 
  fucking autobahn toll got approved recently . 
  and then there 's the stereotype of the germans as humourless hardworking robots which is also wrong but it 's great for the made in germany label . 
   i find it rather offensive if a person assumes all germans wear lederhosen and drink beer . 
  wait , is there a region where people do n't drink beer ? 
   the other thing that rustles my jimmies is the whole nazi thing , because the second world war erased , or at least overshadows all other parts of the incredibly rich german history , so that most people only know us as the country that made the nazis , and hardly anything about the 2000 + years prior to that . 
  weirdly enough i 've never had a problem with that because i 've never really experienced that from non-germans . 
  what i find sad is that for many germans the `` do n't mention the war '' stereotype is one of the few ones with a grain of truth . 
   good thing that no one knows it here . 
  welp , do n't come to germany then or you 'll be disappointed . 
  the tolar only existed for 17 years , did n't it ? 
  there 's a significant mark-nostalgia in germany , too . 
  the afd was originally the `` reintroduce-the-mark '' party before they became a generic right populist party . 
  the mark also has a pretty long history ( though not as long as the pound or even the dollar ) . 
  [ since germany 's unification in 1871 we 've always used the mark before adopting the euro .

  the largest one was [ 1000 mark ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/1000_dm_serie4_vorderseite.jpg ) ( about 500 euro in 2002 ) . 
  i 've seen that scene far too often and he does n't use an american r . he tries to imitate the way hitler spoke . 
  it sounds like he 's trying to roll the r like the austrians do it . 
  sounds that do n't exist in german ( w , th , r ) . 
  some germans have problems with [ \u0292 ] and [ d\u0361\u0292 ] but i 'm used to that as a hessian . 
  if they 're gon na casht sean connery he ` sh got ta shound like sean connery . 
  it would be a crime agaisht humanity to do otherwishe . 
  no , zey do zis because zis is vat most g\u00f6rmans actually sound like when l\u00f6rning english . 
  \\  winter \\  easter that 's norway for you . 
   adding to this : hiding easter eggs for kids to find . 
  is there anyone who does n't do this ? 
  yes , it 's an east frisian thing . 
  in fact , east frisians drink about 290 l of tea per capita each year - more than the uk or ireland . 
  it 's usually black tea . 
  the tea is added first ( lots of it ) then water , but only so much as is necessary for boiling the tea . 
  they like to boil it long which makes the tea bitter and neutralizes the caffeine . 
  only after boiling they add more water for drinking . 
  [ sugar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/brauner_kandiszucker.jpg/1280px-brauner_kandiszucker.jpg ) is almost obligatory , cream is optional but very popular .

  i googled it and apparently that 's exactly what it means . 
  did n't know that . 
  what i meant to say is that he 's a perfectly stereotypical swabian . 
  so are most european countries . 
  slovenia still has cultural regions with their own dialects , nature , culture and so on . 
  i 'm sure there are many differences to describe . 
  tbh i 've never really been to brandenburg except when driving through . 
  as much as he was german . 
  well , it does border the rhineland . 
  well , in general there are two splits . 
  the older north-south split between low germans , middle germans and upper germans , where there are more catholics in the generally more conservative south and more protestants in the generally less conservative north . 
  low , middle and upper germans also have very different dialects and different architecture ( framed wood in the south and red bricks in the north ) . 
  the other split is the one between west and east , where the west has generally less problems with the establishment because people there live in the same country with the same system since 1949 , are richer and are slightly more religious , while the east has a 40-year history of living in a communist country which left the eastern population poorer , almost completely irreligious , ethnically relatively homogeneous and more critical of the establishment . 
  parties like die linke or afd are relatively popular here . 
  this split is still very much present in all economic measures ( wages , unemployment etc. ), 
  the east is also more sparsely populated ( and mostly flat ) . 
  it has a beautiful coast in the north , lots of flatland , lakes and sand in brandenburg , and hills , forests and mountains in the more populous south ( saxony , thuringia ) . 
  in the middle of brandenburg there is berlin , which is a thing on its own . 
  like most capitals , the city and its inhabitants are not very popular . 
  in berlin 's case , there is not a whole lot of beautiful architecture to gloss over that . 
  the northeast speaks low german dialects , berlin and brandenburg have their own dialect and saxony speaks saxon . 
  in the west we have the regions around the north sea . 
  they 're mostly protestant and have a maritime culture . 
  the people there are known for their calm attitude and their love for tea . 
  historically the hansa was very influential here , two hanseatic cities ( hamburg and bremen ) are still on their own . 
  further south we have the region of westphalia ( mixed catholic/protestant ) , in the state nrw together with the northern rhineland . 
  the people there are mostly `` known '' for being boring and loving sch\u00fctzenfests ( sorry westphalians , i really do n't know much about you ) . 
  southeast of that is hesse ( we have now arrived at the middle germans ) . 
  hessian christians are majority protestant , although there is a significant catholic minority . 
  the largest group are irreligious people , though . 
  hessians are known for talking too much and having a funny dialect ( hessian ) . 
  hesse is hilly to mountanous and it 's one of the best wooded regions . 
  in the uttermost west , there is the large and populous rhineland region . 
  this region was the heart of industrialization in germany . 
  people there are traditionally catholic but pretty irreligious today . 
  they have many regional identities and speak various dialects , most of which are practically dead today . 
  they have a reputation of being able to enjoy their life and they love their carnival . 
  in south germany we have the states of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg and bavaria ( and the historical regions of franconia , swabia and baden ) . 
  they 're mostly catholic and also the only people in germany who actually care somewhat about religion . 
  this region is the most well-off in economic terms ( bavaria , hesse and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg are the only states that pay more to other states than they take ) . 
  south german culture is also what foreigners usually think of when imagining germany ( timber framing , mountains , lederhosen , oktoberfest etc ) . 
  i 'm too tired of describing all of it , you probably know it anyway . 
  bavarians are very patriotic towards their state . 
  they speak bavarian ( and franconian in the north ) . 
  their state is the largest and most mountainous of germany . 
  swabians are known for having a funny dialect ( like adding - le to words ) and being stingy ( guess where sch\u00e4uble comes from ) .
