  what lazin said . 
  also note that a whole lot of other countries ( including germany ) arem doing this right now . 
  it 's explicitly temporary . 
  frankfurt : first time mentioned is 794 , oldest traces of settlement are roman . 
  [ legend has it the city was founded by charlemagne fleeeing from the saxons and finding a hidden ford \\ ( the `` francon ford '' \\ ) . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/die_frankenfurt.jpg ), 
  never knew those exist . 
  come down south to germany . 
  you can kill as many as you want and we 'll still have too many of them . 
  what kind of politician is he ? 
  what has he done during his career ? 
  next one is the federal election this year . 
  i 'll probably vote cdu or fdp . 
  in any case , i really do n't feel like spoiling my vote or not voting at all . 
  i have considered voting afd but now i 'm pretty sure i wo n't . 
  the munich massacre in 1972 remains the single most deadly terrorist attack in german history with 17 deaths . 
  if you count both deaths and injuries the oktoberfest terror attack in 1980 was worse , as well as the 1986 berlin discotheque bombing ( only 3 deaths but 231 injuries ) . 
  the 1970s as a whole were pretty terrible , with the red army faction murdering 34 people in their history . 
  maybe this puts the 2016 berlin attack in comparison . 
  12 deaths might sound ridiculous for someone who experienced something like the troubles but it 's the third deadliest terrorist attack in german history . 
  that is of course only counting terrorists attacks , there were two school shootings with more deaths ( 16 and 17 ) . 
  this is also ignoring the incidents during the weimar republic that are mostly forgotten today . 
  i ca n't even find reliable numbers for them . 
  i live in sight of the former hq of the supreme allied command where eisenower had an office and where the creation of the federal republic of germany was decided . 
  i only have to walk a few minutes to come to the place where most holy roman emperors were elected and later crowned . 
  only a few meters from there is the place where the peace treaty of the franco-prussian war was negotiated and the place where the national assembly of the 1848 revolution was seated . 
  there are some roman ruins nearby . 
  there 's a great novel about it , `` die kinder aus theresienstadt '' . 
  have you heard of it ? 
  united states or australia, 
  it absolutely is , as are the positive effects of a minimum wage for low wage owners if unions are n't powerful enough to negotiate their own one . 
  the effect on the employment rate does n't have to be an argument against the minimum wage . 
  waiting for balkan war songs , 
   contrary to what the critics of minimum wage said , it did n't lead to mass unemployment . 
  that 's a strawman , no ? 
  nobody respectable said 8.50 euro minimum wage would lead to mass unemployment . 
  that raising the minimum wage effects the employment rate is well established , though . 
  yeah , what i meant to say was that that 's not really an eastern european thing rather than a baltic thing . 
  tbf there are many persons here in germany who do know all of this . 
  is n't that specifically estonia , though ? 
  czechia and slovenia are very friendly towards russia . 
  at one point you got ta admit that the destruction of europe and millions of possible dead are more important than the political system in hungary . 
  they were n't even allied or had made promises like before ww2 . 
  i want for scotland to happen what the scots want , whether it 's remaining part of the uk or becoming independent . 
  personally i do n't think scotland nor the uk would profit from scottish independence . 
  at best they would remain in a common market together but even then it would be harder for both new countries to defend themselves . 
  i think the arguments for an independent scotland are largely the same than the arguments for the uk leaving the eu and i disagree with most of them . 
  i 'm not very happy myself to see a return to nationalism and isolationism , even if it 's combined with rejoining the eu . 
  an independent scotland may look like a good thing for the eu in the short term but it can be bad for europe and the west in the long term . 
  there is also no guarantee that an independent scotland will remain a loyal eu member considering that almost 40 % of the population voted leave . 
  having to deal with financial problems and the long and complicated process of joining the eu might turn out to be a very sobering experience for the scottish population and even turn the public opinion against the eu . 
  it was called `` dreifarb '' during the 1848 revolution but that was 150 years ago . 
  a fleg referendum ? 
  in norn iron ? 
  it 'll be the troubles all over again !, 
  why the exclamation marks ? 
  in german they 're just called korps . 
  what naming system ? 
  we had a few good ones . 
  [ a more recent one is this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/5s1vcr/wer_hat_in_die_k%c3%bcche_gekackt/ ) [ and this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4rbhw0/oc_lieber_fahrraddieb/ ) edit : oh yeah , i forgot to summarize them . 
  / u/graf _ icky did a [ good job ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5z4lbw/what_are_some_of_the_most_memorable_threads_in/devbod0/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=askeurope ) at that . 
  [ and of course we also had this guy from down under sharing his passion for remoulade and getting free remoulade in response . 
  fillon does sometimes which is a bit weird for a french candidate . 
  wehraboos or americans ? 
  scotland vs scotland, 
  reducing the dependency on oil exports would definitely be a great thing . 
  yeah , russian media can get eerily close to `` we 've always been at war with eastasia '' sometimes . 
  especially the quickly changing relations to turkey were a bit weird to watch . 
  maybe liberalization should n't be sold as westernisation . 
  russia does not necessarily need to become `` like the west '' . 
  russia with a functioning democracy is still russia , not the west . 
  russia without putin ( he is not immortal ... ) will still be russia . 
  a free press does not carry the risk of becoming an american puppet state . 
  if russia media are allowed to talk free they will still praise their country like in most countries . 
  frankfurt vs. offenbach everyone vs. berlin, 
  or thinking both at the same time . 
  or constantly switching between both views while not actually doing anything . 
  one day it 's all `` rassiya is best country , fuck the west '' and as soon as something bad happens ( like losing your job ) it 's all `` i 'm gon na leave this terrible country , fuck russia '' . 
  and the day after that they 're still in russia , drinking and contemplating how to get a job . 
  the nazis did some shady stuff with their central bank , their currency and debts but most right-wing dictators ( including hitler ) were in bed with the country 's capitalists and did n't dare harming them . 
  franco 's and salazar 's economic policy are nothing special , actually salazar 's economic policy is one of the reasons there is still some weird nostalgia for him . 
  wait , do you want to tell me that odin and njord were not actually kings of sweden ? 
  the difference is that the dutch do n't usually stoop so low to resort to nazi comparisons . 
  british newspapers do that sometimes , maybe i should have listed them , too . 
  spanish newpapers are also mostly pretty good and do n't do that . 
   i think the germans that say that are saying it in joke . 
  i only ever encounter it in polandball comics . 
  it was a common sentiment at the start of the greek economic crisis . 
  [ this dutch cartoon got a lot of attention . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vfoo3dx.jpg ) i 'd love to say germans are n't like this but many are . 
  slovenia is glorious central europe , of course . 
  it has central european architecture , alpine nature and adriatic coast and weather . 
  as a german on reddit it 's really funny to be accused of betraying our past and having become a leftist rabble that does n't deserve the name germany anymore by american wehraboos while at the same time being accused of being stupid nazis by some central europeans , southern europeans and eastern europeans . 
  it 's either `` germany apologizes to much and brainwashes children to hate their country '' or `` germany never apologizes and never stopped being a nazi country '' . 
  there 's the / r/worldnews thread that complains about zdf being a leftist , germany-hating state propaganda tool that wants to destroy german culture and the poles in a / r/europe thread advocating to boycott zdf for being a nazi state propaganda tool that wants to fulfill a fascist german agenda by mentioning `` polish deathcamps '' and helping germany conquer europe . 
  for fuck 's sake , it 's so damn annoying . 
  this is coming from the same countries whose governments are openly nationalist , often irredentist and look down at non-europeans . 
  pis which has the majority of seats in the sejm and forms the government is more racist and farther right than the afd could ever aspire to be and they 're currently around 10 % .
