  consensus culture is a good thing but the problem with grand coalitions is that you ca n't remove them from power if you do n't like their policy . 
  this leads to people voting for smaller , more extreme parties like the afd to reduce the seat percentage of the grand coalition . 
  this does n't work because the result of that is that no coalition but a grand coalition is actually able to form a government . 
   also , i have the feeling that the political climate is much less toxic in germany than in france . 
  i think this has more to do with the political culture in germany than with our parliamentary system . 
  most germans shut politics out of their life . 
  they want a stable political environment that does n't require them to think too much about politics . 
  it 's not unusual for chancellors to serve three or more terms ( merkel is probably about to serve a fourth term , even though she 's not that popular ) . 
  sure , why not ? 
  that 's your decision alone . 
  who am i to dictate what you should think or love ? 
   i love germany , it 's people and culture etc. 
  is it about this ? 
  yes , i think a patriot is someone who loves his country . 
  other countries are also great but i ca n't equally love everyone and everything . 
  germany happens to be my country and it 's the one i love the most . 
  [ i like johannes rau 's take on this . 
  loyal - yes , but i have trouble with the word `` devoted '' . 
  i 'm not a subject . 
  i would not do everything for my country but i think there 's a lot you can do for your country without being blindly devoted . 
  same here . 
  it 's the place where i was born , where i grew up and learned the customs , where i became the person i am now . 
  i do love my country so i would n't have a problem saying that i 'm patriotic . 
  what ? 
  we also have `` onkel '' and `` tante '' but that 's old-fashioned and something younger children would n't say anymore . 
  `` mama , der onkel hat gesagt ... '' `` mom , that guy said ... '', 
  pretty common . 
  not because frankfurt is such a great place to visit but because it 's home of the frankfurt airport where most tourists from other continents who want to visit germany come from . 
  many japanese . 
  as i said , frankfurt is usually the first thing they see after arrival , so they take pics of literally everything and try to act amazed by our mediocre architecture . 
  they probably think the rest of the country is similar to frankfurt and they do n't want to act disappointed . 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  i tried to look it up and wikipedia says about a third of the people in the border regions are still descendants of czech families in the sudetenland . 
  it 's wikipedia , but it does sound realistic . 
  the wikipedia article also says that one of the reasons the border regions are so run down today is because unlike in poland , the settlement was only seen as temporary by many who feared for the gone germans to come back , so they did n't really care about rebuilding houses and building their own economy like the poles did . 
  that seems very weird to me because the situtation in germany was the opposite . 
  the frg claimed the territories east of oder and nei\u00dfe for a long time ( legally they were part of germany until 1990 ) , but they never tried to claim the sudetenland . 
   germans ' scorn of czechs i do n't think we really scorn czechs anymore . 
  at worst we group you together with eastern european countries , at best we think of your cheap beer and great vacation spots . 
  why did they include estonia but exclude saaremaa ? 
  that 's something i 've always wanted to know : are there separate bohemian , moravian and silesian identities ? 
  if yes , what makes the different ? 
  culture , language , history ? 
  are there official regions/political divisions corresponding to them ? 
  in poland , people in the former german parts are pretty different . 
  they speak similar and without a strong dialect and they are pretty liberal . 
  they 're less rural , religious and traditional and even their cities look somewhat different ( remnants of german architecture ) . 
  are people from the border to germany similar to those poles ? 
  i guess the difference is that these regions have always belonged to bohemia ( except for wwii ) and the percentage of czechs was always very high . 
  are the people who live there mostly descendants of czech families that lived there before wwii or are they mostly descendants of internal migrants from other parts of the country ? 
  why does it extend to slavonia and the baltics ? 
  this is bigger than most people may think . 
  immediately before the third republic more than a third of france used to speak occitan and among the remaining people there were speakers of basque , breton , norman and many other o\u00efl languages as well as franco-proven\u00e7al , italian and german . 
  only a minority actually used parisian french in everyday life . 
  imagine an alternate history of russia where ukrainan , belarusian , finnish and kazakh languages have almost died out ( there actually were a lot of languages and local cultures that have already died out because of russification ) . 
  germany , then europe . 
  i also identify with my hometown frankfurt . 
  it 's a part of hesse , which most frankfurters do n't actually care much about because they 're relatively isolated from the rest of the state they were assigned to after the war . 
  but hesse is a great state and i have no problem saying that i 'm hessian . 
  from the post-war era i guess . 
  in germany and austria many people did n't change their nazi views after the war but did n't admit it openly . 
  as long as neither me nor someone i like is involved i 'd always take one dead man over five dead people . 
  i 'm patriotic , but not so stupidly nationalist that i 'd let five people die just because the other guy is from my country . 
  why ? 
  it has disadvantages , too . 
   *** is *** treated haider *** is *** dead . 
  they 're probably treated better than most minorities in the world . 
  they have the same rights as all other austrians , their language is enshrined in the carinthian constitution and they have slovenian elementaries and gymnasiums . 
  definitely a huge difference to the slovenian germans that used to inhabit parts of slovenian carinthia and were ethnically cleansed/forcibly displaced . 
  that said , i do n't like what the carinthian government recently did with their constitution that reduces the slovenian language to a status inferior to german . 
  the previous constitution was even worse . 
  i do n't think the allies felt like settling for a stalemate . 
  wwii, 
  we have more than one personification .

  [ here you can see her special relationship with italia . 
  it 's also commonly accepted because it has been official since the early weimar republic and it had already been very popular before . 
  a new anthem would feel out of place . 
  definitely not austria and germany , sehr geehrter herr professor doktor doratch . 
  eh , i do n't want to start a fight so i 'll try ot make it short : he was born at a time when austrians were a subgroup of germans like bavarians are and he was a very patriotic german . 
  he was not born in austria but in salzburg which had never been part of austria before and was traditionally part of the bavarian region . 
  he was very influential in austria , mostly lived in austria and died in austria . 
  he is pretty austrian , but also pretty german . 
  some people claim kant is russian because he was born in what is today russia . 
  a pole who admires luther and calls mickiewicz lithuanian ? 
  also , mozart for austria might trigger a few people , too .

  i 'm basically living off leberk\u00e4se , it 's great .

  i 've never heard someone compare it to sausage but i guess it has similarities . 
  the pro-arguments are mainly those that apply for any free trade agreement . 
  there 's a [ good faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/economics/wiki/faq_trade ) on this in / r/economics . 
  the contra-arguments are mostly about [ isds ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/de/news-room/20150605sto63242/ttip-investor-staat-schiedsverfahren ) which is used for many international treaties . 
  there are concerns about isds courts hurting national legislation . 
  this has not happened yet in the many , many cases eu countries already use isds for their treaties but who knows . 
  another concern is about sneaking other things in the ceta treaty . 
  this happens a lot with large treaties . 
  legislators include things in them that do n't have much to do with free trade but also wo n't get a lot of coverage because those treaties are very long .
