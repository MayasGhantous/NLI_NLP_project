  so one can end up with bad legislation without knowing it . 
   at worst it was something akin to a conspiracy theory about how the canadians want to poison us with genetically modified maple syrup every international treaty attracts droves of conspiracy theorists but some concerns are definitely justified . 
  funny thing is that many canadians think the same ( that we europeans want to harm them with bad european products ) . 
  both sides have people who are convinced of the other side 's malintent .

   i 've never really been to northern or eastern germany , a shame , there 's a lot of [ beautiful ] ( http://www.altewasserkunstbautzen.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/slider-waku-3.jpg ) old [ city cores ] ( https://jengibreenpolvo.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/p1160234.jpg ) in the [ east ] ( https://media.holidaycheck.com/data/urlaubsbilder/images/41/1155815342.jpg ) . 
  that sounds like germans pronouncing french words ( kartong , kuseng , ongaschmong ) . 
  if he 's really from near the polish border he might even be speaking silesian , which is spoken in the tiny bit of silesia that 's still part of germany . 
  germany has been `` blessed '' with a very lifely modern history , the french revolutionaries warring us , the napoleonic wars , revolutions and uprisings in the 1830s , more uprisings in the 1840s and a huge revolution in 1848 , many wars between 1860 and 1871 , then unification , a boom , a crash , contantly changing alliances and colonial frenzy under wilhelm ii from 1890 till wwi , several dreadful international crises with our involvement from 1900 to 1914 , wwi , a revolution in the last year of the war , regime change and chaos from 1818 until the early 20s , a huge crash and hyperinflation , the rise of the nsdap , hitler 's * machtergreifung * , revision of pretty much all our borders and anschluss auf austria in the 1930s , wwii , occupation and partition between the victors of wwii , participating on both sides of the cold war and reunification . 
  if i had to choose anything realtively uneventful i 'd say : the 1820s ( biedermeier ) , the 1850s directly after the failed revolution between the schleswig war and the panic of 1857 , the 1880s in unified germany , the later 20s , maybe the 1950s and the 1979s . 
  the 2010s are pretty exciting so far . 
  probably one of the less eventful decades in german history , though . 
  our economy has been doing really good so far , but the eu finance crisis and the refugee crisis are some pretty important events , too . 
   `` what is the place with the funniest dialect in your country ? '', 
   romania flair  `` here we have moldova . '', 
  if you can cheat by using dialects outside your country i propose [ this \\ ( vorarlbergisch \\ ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkswxxfg8em ), 
  i mean there 's a reason most dialect maps look like [ this . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/continental_west_germanic_languages.png ) the difference between the `` german '' dialects on dutch border and the `` dutch '' dialects on the german border is incredibly smooth , it 's hard to hear a difference . 
  that 's totally different to danish , which has a clear-cut language border with german . 
  southern danish dialects and north german dialects are pretty different and their speakers do n't understand each other while germans and dutchies across the borders can pretty easily understand each other . 
  dutch and flemish people were also considered german at one time ( mostly before the rise of german nationalism during the 19th century ) . 
  sort of . 
  cities for example have a higher degree of financial autonomy and a bigger government than small towns and rural districts do n't really need any of this . 
  it 's similar in most us states . 
  romania just announced they experienced a gdp growth of 4.8 % in 2016 . 
  that 's pretty amazing . 
  it 's a thing at some point in pretty much all european countries . 
  towns and villages change in population , people go to the cities and abandon the countryside , new villages spring up etc. . . 
  this results in municipalities with high autonomy that have almost no population and rural municipalities without much autonomy with higher population . 
  it makes municipal reform necessary once every few decades . 
  basically you redraw the municipal borders , revoke autonomy rights for rotten municipalities and things like these . 
  the problem is that it 's usually a lot of quarrelling between municipalities who do n't want to be merged or give up autonomy rights . 
  west germany did large scale reforms decades ago , the east german states have to deal with this shit right now . 
  thuringia is now trying to reform their municipalities but the local governments just ca n't agree on something . 
  hey , the little mole !, 
  i 'm ashamed to say i notized something similar going on with me when i 'm on vacation in a country where people do n't speak german . 
  exactly . 
  at least he gets a nice [ palace ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/bellevue_palace_berlin_02-14.jpg ) and a [ nice car ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/dienstfahrzeug_des_bundespraesidenten.jpg ) with the 0-1 plate . 
  i know about the romanian contributions in the axis , it 's pretty impressive romania managed to do that after germany and hungary took away large parts of the country . 
  it 's just that with a standing army of 1.000.000 soldiers and the world 's largest nuclear arsenal the russian government can easily tease romania without having to fear much . 
   another interesting thing is that unlike many european countries , we could be completely independent of russian gas . 
  makes it harder to blackmail us . 
  that 's indeed a huge difference to germany , without russian gas we 'd have a problem . 
   i think that without nuclear power , russia would n't be as impressive as it is considered to be . 
  definitely , but that 's true for any nuclear power . 
  once or twice a century / s not really , we do n't border each other and do n't openly threaten each other . 
  we had pretty good relations before 2014 and trade between us is still immensely important for both sides but as valuable as our partnership is , our government * unfortunately * decided that conquering parts of europe in violation of tons of international treaties should not be tolerated and dared not approve of it . 
  i guess that makes us nazis and warmongers . 
   russian ambassador to romania says we are russophobes and hate russia and that our media always attacks russia . 
  way to shut up critique of the russia government . 
  i wonder if criticizing trump makes me anti-american . 
   if russia would do the same to france or germany it would be scandal but when he threatens us or poland or baltics we just accept it . 
  i mean everyone is used to it by now but its become very `` normalized '' ... that 's the way it is . 
  romania is not as strong or as important as france or germany . 
  we 're not interested in infinitely deteriorating relations with russia so i guess you have to bend over and take it . 
  it 's just posturing anyway . 
  no one can help romania and it does n't hurt anyway . 
  they 're just playing with you . 
  it may sound harsh , but there 's no eu comission or nato command for hurt feelings . 
  edit : btw i noticed how you used the term russophile in a similar way some people use the term russophobe . 
  i do n't think you meant much by it but i just wanted to say that we really should n't make this a `` you 're with us or you 're against us '' situation . 
  they do . 
  source : am youngster, 
  we have quite a lot kurdish immigrants in germany but most people probably would n't know the difference between kurds and turks . 
  they 're muslim immigrants from turkey , that 's what most people see . 
  it does n't help that they 're not distinct from turks in german statistics because these statistics only care for nationality , not ethnicity . 
  [ this faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/economics/wiki/faq_basicincome ) in / r/economics ca n't provide an answer but it 's really ood . 
  could you provide any argument for this ? 
   it 's going to be necessary . 
  why is it going to be necessary ? 
   birth rates lowering and automation . 
  you just wrote two terms without explaining what ubi has to do with them . 
   capitalism is a house of cards which is going to fall down sooner or later . 
  what does that mean ? 
  on what arguments do you base this statement ? 
  nice city . 
  i was there a few times because it 's on the way from moscow to kirov , where my grandma lives . 
  more beer . 
  if they 're head of government and head of state in one person they 're literally like a president in a presidential system . 
  interestingly there was a strong republican movement before wwi . 
  when the republican sd party got the majority people flipped out and pressed the king not to approve their government . 
  in a controversial decision the king approved them and the social democrats did n't abolish the monarchy . 
  it may sound harsh but wwii was great for the monarchy . 
  it became a symbol against occupation and for independence . 
  it made the norwegians appreciate what they had in their king . 
  i mean , i like the monarchy but that 's not an argument . 
  the commonwealth of england , scotland and ireland did exist for a while . 
  there is some prussia-nostalgia in the rhineland and a tiny bit of nostalgia among former gdrians . 
  the gdr in its latter days promoted it through things like movies . 
  there are very , very small monarchist groups but they 're absolutely insignificant . 
  the hohenzollers were really hated when the monarchy was abolished , during the weimar republic there was a call for the expropriation of all hohenzollern property without compensation . 
  there were never strong feelings about the monarchy itself . 
  shortly after the war , about half of germans were theoretically in favor of a monarchy , but they really did n't care much and it was n't feasible anyway with the partition . 
  today monarchist groups are very small . 
  the current hohenzollern head and pretender to the prussian throne has n't even shown interest in becoming a monarch again . 
  he 's said multiple times that he likes having a private life and is probably happier than his predecessors . 
  when people are nostalgic , they 're usually nostalgic for the old gdr , the old frg or nazi germany . 
  there 's almost no one left that actually lived through the monarchy . 
  we 're just used to living in a republic , for most people it 's the way it 's always been for them .
