  outside of hesse : the altes land region has a beautiful [ bridal crown ] ( http://www.br.de/fernsehen/ard-alpha/sendungen/schulfernsehen/tracht-niedersachsen-altlaender100~_v-img__16__9__xl_-d31c35f8186ebeb80b0cd843a7c267a0e0c81647.jpg?version=9cc72 ) ( the guy on the left is our president btw , he 's just visiting a festival ) outside of germany : [ circassian traditional dresses ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d4/f9/e2/d4f9e264c9bff965d0a7028e4ded9a82.jpg ) are absolutely gorgeous . 
  probably my favourite . 
  i 'm so bummed we 're not participating in spasskaya tower anymore since crimea . 
  we should really play this . 
   i dont see them hating the us for invading other countries . 
  are you living in the same europe ? 
  i do n't think he cares much about eastern europe at all . 
  think simpler , think like trump : the eu is bad , russia is good , if eastern europe also does n't like the eu that 's good for them and if they do n't like russia that 's not america 's problem . 
  also the uk is not pro-russia at all . 
  they 're one of the few countries in europe that have supported all possible measures against russia and one of only three european countries that are actually paying the military budget nato wants their members to pay ( 2 % ) . 
  trump 's policy is isolationism and protectionism . 
  for this policy , his stance towards eastern europe makes sense . 
  the english wikipedia does n't even have an article about free beer so you got ta resort to the [ german one . 
  i believe the scots have the right what to do with their own nation but personally i was very happy that the uk did n't break up in 2014 . 
  i do n't like the new support after the brexit refendum very much . 
  i know some people are mad at the english for the oucome of the brexit referendum ( i also hoped they would remain ) but most arguments of 2014 still apply . 
  a weak uk and rising regional nationalism is just as big a threat for the eu as brexit is . 
   it seems like most belgians are n't nationalistic but the ones who are passionate towards their identity seem to be favourable towards either the walloon or flemish sides . 
  i ca n't recall ever seeing someone being nationalistic towards belgium as a whole . 
  i think op talked about belgian nationalism specifically and that 's indeed pretty rare . 
  same in germany . 
  i got downvoted to hell in / r/de for complaining about it . 
  shoes ai n't exactly cleaner . 
  same for me . 
  no shoes at home and no shoes for the first four grades ( elementary school ) . 
  of fucking course the tagesschau ( 5:38 ) has to have one of the most boring and reductionist intros out there . 
  i actually like it very much , especially because they kept with the general design since 1952 , but i personally prefer a soothing male voice announcing it . 
  the srf one is also nice . 
  what can they really fuck up on state level ? 
  foreign policy , defense and most aspects of economic policy are controlled by the federal government . 
  you can only do it if double surname has already been passed down for generations ( like faber-castell ) but you ca n't create new combinations for your children . 
  you can do that if you marry , but you ca n't do that with your children . 
  double surnames for children are forbidden , though the children can assume a double surname themselves if they 're old enough . 
  i think you 're overstimating the quality of swiss journalism . 
  but generally i do agree with you , that 's why i think it would be best to introduce on a state level . 
  i 'm afraid of what could happen if we introduced it at federal level . 
  i really like switzerland 's system of direct democracy . 
  i 'd like to see it implemented in germany on a state level . 
  in germany a lot of catholic men have this name but i do n't think it 's done with young children anymore . 
  [ yes , that is true !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyffh%c3%a4user ) apart from that , barbarossa was indeed some kind of national hero from the 19th century until the war . 
  in germany ? 
  well , we participated and barbarossa is pretty famous here . 
  but is he a national hero ? 
  i ca n't remember someone referring to him as a hero . 
  he 's just a guy who was hremperor a millennium ago , we had lots of those . 
  at least barbarossa is one of the most famous ones . 
  the kingdom of england and the kingdom of scotland do n't exist anymore since the acts of union . 
  lizzy is * queen of great britain and northern ireland * . 
  slovakia would also prefer it if czechia did that  though i got ta say that the czechoslovak flag that is still in use is a great design . 
  very easily recognizable . 
  a guy with dark hair and dark eyes promoting a `` typically german '' appearance that is n't even very fitting . 
  maybe he 'd rather have been leader of the netherlands or a scandinavian country . 
  [ or estonia for that matter ... ] ( http://iisakusegakoor.onepagefree.com/files/laulupidu%20378.jpg ), 
  also most ethnic germans are brown-haired , especially in the south . 
  i do n't know why people keep thinking we are mostly blond . 
  i do n't think they 're less european . 
  europe exists even without any institutions and any country is free to choose whether they want to participate in them or not . 
  they do n't have to share my ideals . 
  that does n't stop me from being proud of it , though . 
  continuing this comparison , germany exists with or without the frg but that does n't stop me from seeing frg achievements as german achievements , even if not every german likes them or shares my pride . 
  a country is not less or more european depending on its participation in these projects but these project are definitely european achievements . 
  they did n't happen in africa or asia , they happened exactly here , made real by european countries . 
  probably both . 
  if i travel to another country knowing that my passport is the most powerful on earth i 'm not just proud of the foreign department of the federal government of the frg , i 'm proud of germany . 
  the eu and the eurozone are european achievements , i think it 's absolutely right to be proud of them as a european . 
  the eurasian union does have a single market but that 's pretty much it . 
  i mean they was * some * damage during wwii and there were wwi , the st\u00e4ndestaat and hitler . 
  but there 's definitely a difference . 
  well , that makes more sense . 
  yep . 
  i know it as wrote . 
  i looked it up and apparently both versions are used . 
  the [ nibelungenlied ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nibelungenlied ) is a medieval work of literature based on the much older [ nibelungensaga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nibelung ) . 
  it considered germany 's national epic . 
  there 's also the [ hildebrandslied ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hildebrandslied ) , one of the oldest german works of literature , and there 's a whole lot about sagas and stories about [ theoderic the great ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legends_about_theoderic_the_great ) ( dietrich von bern in german ) . 
   i do n't trust you for a meter . 
   he fell with the door in house . 
  we have those in german , too . 
  i 'm not russian so i 'm technically not answering the question here but i got to say that russia really takes the cake with sayings that make the least sense in english . 
  like `` work is n't a wolf , it wo n't run into the forest '' ( you can do that tomorrow ) . 
  or `` language leads to kiev '' ( you can reach a lot by talking ) , `` without fish , crabs are fish '' ( you got ta make the best out of what you have ) , `` if you have acted like a milk-cap , then go into the basket '' ( i never really understood this ) . 
  my russian father has a lot of those . 
  as for german ones : there is `` the mouse does n't snap of a thread there '' ( ca n't do anything about it anymore ) , `` the shirt is closer than the trousers '' ( about being selfish ) , `` the devil is a squirrel '' ( bad things can look innocent ) . 
  also trau , schau , wem ( `` always be wary who to trust '' ) - i have no idea how to translate that in a way it would be understood in english . 
  literally it 's `` trust , look , to whom '' . 
  i 'm in love with austria and switzerland . 
  both seem to me like better alternate versions of germany that did n't experience the same traumas that germany did ( ignoring the anschluss ) . 
  while germany was brutalized by a century of war , destruction , dicatorships and division , those two countries were n't as much . 
  austria in particular gives me some kind of uncanny valley feeling . 
  similar customs , same language ( but different dialects ) , they were even considered part of `` germany '' until a few decades ago . 
  but they 're not germany . 
  switzerland and austria have n't experienced displacement , expulsion and a communist dictatorship , their old city cores are still there , they still feel * whole * , i 'm not sure how to describe this . 
  there 's not the same bitterness we have in germany . 
  what i do n't like about those two countries is the way they view germany and germans . 
  ironically , out of all european countries i 've been to i felt least welcome in switzerland and austria even though especially austrians are usually known for their politeness and hospitality . 
  i enjoy the playful bashing and nagging of germany in the netherlands but in austria it seems very real to me and not at all playful . 
  there are a few people there who loath everything german . 
  i was just using the most recent and important events . 
  eu4 taught me about skanderbeg but that 's pretty much all i know .
