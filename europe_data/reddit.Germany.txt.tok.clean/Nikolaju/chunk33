  [ tell that the prime minister of serbia . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33168125 ), 
   hungary is sending police to help serbia remove kebab . 
  serbia was actually pretty miffed because of the whole border fence thing . 
  so has serbia . 
  that sounds very objective and impartial , 
  the bad relation to croatia is because of the croatian independence war , the bad relation to b&h is because of the bosnian war , the bad relation to kosovo ( if you can even call it relation if they do n't recognize kosovo ) is because of the kosovo war , the bad relation with albania has also a lot to do with kosovo ( i 'm mentioning albania as a neighbour even though it does n't really border serbia anymore since the war ) . 
  montenegro split from serbia after a referendum the eu wished for and serbia is n't happy about it . 
  nowadays montenegro is getting really close to nato and even planning to join , there is already some cooperation . 
  macedonia was also part of serbia ( it was even called south serbia between the balkan wars and before the formation of yugoslavia ) but relations are n't that bad . 
  as for the rest : hungary , bulgaria , albania and romania are members of nato which serbia really does n't like . 
  hungary was even involved in the kosovo war as it already was part of nato back then . 
  hungary , croatia , montenegro , albania , macedonia and bulgaria recognize kosovo which is a no-go for the serbian government . 
  bulgarian irredentists and serbian irredentists both want to claim macedonia for them ( which is populated mostly by bulgarians and albanians ) . 
  bulgaria and serbia fought against each other in the second balkan war , wwi , wwii and bulgaria joined nato after the end of the cold war . 
  relations with romania are actually pretty okay . 
  romania does n't recognize kosovo and `` only '' fought against serbia in wwii , though they 're part of nato and serbia is n't . 
  if you consider georgia and armenia european ( i 'd say they kinda are ) there are the [ georgian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgian_scripts ) and [ armenian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_alphabet ) writings systems . 
  at least you do n't have ber . 
  honestly we should ask america if we can use the nuke sharing agreement between us to nuke it from the face of the earth . 
  for me i 'd say it 's foreign policy and the stance on the eu . 
  even if a candidate/party has a very sensible economic policy etc and i agree with their views on most things i would never vote for a someone eurosceptic or blatantly pro-russian . 
  the eu is just too beneficial for germany . 
  from a russian perspective it definitely seems best to hold on to crimea . 
  do n't get me wrong , i think my country ( germany ) and the other western countries should do everything to thwart that . 
  but i say that from a western and european perspective , because i think the annexation of crimea is a bad thing for nato and peace in europe and the world . 
  it does n't seem like a bad thing for russia though ( if you 're okay with international isolation , sanctions and scaring ukraine away from russia , possibly forever ) . 
  if i were russian i do n't think i would act against my country 's interests , just as westerners should n't let russia do anything ( looking at you , trump ) . 
  i can totally understand why most russians are very proud of the annexation . 
  yes and i also meant wwi , not wwii . 
  that i was on the wrong place . 
  no , i mean rudolf ii . 
  he set up the conditions for the 30 years ' war . . 
  i regularly visit my russian grandma and it seems to me that stalin has become even more popular during the last years . 
  i see posters , books about him etc and i 've rarely heard someone talk bad about him . 
  do you think that 's true ? 
  that he got more popular during the last years and his getting even more popular ? 
  rudolf ii , that fucker . 
  thanks for the thirty years ' war that almost halved our population . 
  also thanks for starting the long turkish war that lasted over 10 years until the hungarians were fed up and revolted , finally ending indecisively without any noteworthy achievements . 
  frankfurt was a free city and only annexed by prussia in the 1860s so the only monarchs we ever had were the frankish kings , the holy roman emperors , the ~ ~ french puppets ~ ~ grand dukes of frankfurt and the kings of prussia . 
  the french puppet was napoleon 's stepson , he was also not great because no one likes foreign rule . 
  wilhelm i was also a terrible king of prussia with wwi and fucking up our foreign policy and all that . 
  we lost against him , he occupied our east , installed a dictatorship and expelled millions of germans from their ancestral homelands further east . 
  east germans are relatively pro-russian but they also hate him because of what he did to them . 
  he also deported the volga germans to siberia ( many of them live in germany now , e.g. 
  helene fischer ) and did the same thing with the tatar majority in crimea which still comes in very handy for russia . 
  in general , he was very fond of cruelly deporting other peoples from their centuries-old ancestral homelands to replace them with ethnic russians in many parts of the country which is still great for russia right now . 
  otherwise they would n't be able to hold on to kaliningrad so far west where lots of rockets are stationed . 
  or to crimea with its port and strategic position . 
  he was able to succeed with the lebensraum campaign hitler failed at , the difference being that he was n't ideologically motivated ( he was n't even an ethnic russian ) . 
   that 's a bit better but still would look as if you are too clumsy to find into your mouth with your worse hand . 
  i never understood why we deliberately make our life harder by doing this . 
  we could as well eat while standing because children can not stand that long . 
  to expand on this , they believe this because until [ 1990 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ) the german empire in the borders of 1937 did indeed `` exist '' and the eastern territories were only administered by poland and russia without being a legal part of them . 
  what they do n't seem to get is that a ) that does not mean at all the frg or gdr were illegitimate , it only means neither of them was `` germany and b ) that in the year 1990 the frg became the legal successor of the german empire and now represents the exact same subject of international law , thus finally legally shifting the eastern borders of germany to the oder-nei\u00dfe and inheriting all debts of the german empire . 
  we are officially `` germany '' now and the last debts of wwi were payed a while ago . 
  note : `` german empire '' ( deutsches reich ) was just the official name of germany from 1871 until 1945 , in the same way `` bundesrepublik deutschland '' ( federal republic of germany ) is now the official name of the same country , just with a different constitution . 
  tax evasion is probably one of the main reasons some people keep insisting on this . 
  you mean [ subsidies ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/accessing-markets/trade-defence/actions-against-imports-into-the-eu/anti-subsidy/ ) ? 
  it 's snowing right now here in frankfurt , that 's when the mostly mediocre city gets really beautiful . 
  even the [ most terrible part ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mky6kdi.jpg ) of the city looks good right now . 
  my favourite photo is probably [ this classic shot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gjayhwj.jpg ) of the frankfurt christmas market that i 've also seen on reddit a few times . 
  our most controversial figure ? 
  no way , a lot of people like him . 
  i 'd say one of the more known afd members takes this title . 
  maybe von storch or petry . 
  \u201e `` can also be used in bookes `` '' as a variant of '' `` is also pretty common . 
  well , we own heligoland now and the brits do n't own zanzibar . 
  that 's a win i guess . 
  probably heligoland ( helgoland in german ) and its history . 
  heligoland is a tiny island in the north sea that used to belong to the uk from 1807 until 1890 but it is * inhabited by germans and do n't you forget that . 
  * it 's too small to be used as a naval base since the rise of air forces and only about 1400 people are living there . 
  throughout the 19th century there was a movement to free this * german soil occupied by foreigners * that found its first end when germany traded the whole of zanzibar for tiny heligoland , a ridiculous trade that was mocked a lot at that time . 
  the brits bombed it until it was uninhabitable in wwii and the population fled to the mainland . 
  it was then used to test bombs and the brits managed to fire the largest non-nuclear explosion in history , changing the shape of heligoland . 
  but do n't forget that this * german soil was occupied by a foreign force again * and so a group of students crossed the strait , sneaked onto the island ( it was forbidden to do that ) and proudly raised the flag of germany , the flag of europe and the flag of heligoland in an act of patriotic defiance . 
  this sparked a countrywide movement for the return of the island and the bundestag unanimously voted for the liberation of heligoland . 
  the brits gave in and gave the island back in 1952 . 
  the remaining natives went back and rebuilt their town . 
  [ they do clean it from time to time . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/erzengel_michael_2016.jpg/3456px-erzengel_michael_2016.jpg ) it 's the archangel michael ( his name is on his halo ) . 
  the big words above him are `` gott mit uns '' ( god with us ) , the motto of prussia and the former motto of the german military . 
  [ battle of nations ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/eingang_v%c3%b6lkerschlachtsdenkmal.jpg ) m8 . 
  well it was better for them to voluntarily go to germany while it was still safe than to be forcefully removed by the soviets . 
   forcing germans to use the polish endonyms instead of the native exonyms is political correctness gone crazy i think it 's funny that this never caught on in germany . 
  our leftists ususally adopt pretty much any pc fad but even the most leftists people almost completely use the german names . 
  the polish names are not widely known and nobody can pronounce them anway . 
  who wants to fail at pronouncing choszczno ( chhhoschtschtznooo . . ) if you can say arnswalde . 
   it would be more of an issue today if almost all baltic germans had n't left estonia in 1939/1940 . 
  they even did it voluntarily . 
  the heim ins reich campaign was probably one of the few good things hitler did . 
  do you know why [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/berlin_siegess%c3%a4ule_8245.jpg ) was built ? 
  or why [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/danevirke%2c_valdemar%27s_wall-3.jpg ) was built and who ironically owns it now ? 
  i 'd make germany a constitutional monarchy . 
  it 's something i would never expect to happen with the ewigkeitsklausel still existing . 
  http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-01.htm the parts op mention concern the power of the government and federalism . 
  wait , what ?
