  are you going to make a trip to the north during your studies ( sweden/norway/greenland ) ? 
  excited is probably not the right word . 
  people hear my german accent and instantly assume i 'm german , which i am . 
  it 's a feat of coming from a large and widely known country . 
  i assume most russians are also instantly recognized by most people . 
  it might be different with asian russians or tatars . 
  well , if you 're speaking german , chances are that you are german since austria has about a 10th of the population of the frg . 
  what 's `` german '' and what 's `` austrian '' is also a matter of opinion even in austria . 
  it 's not great because the ecb has no control over it but it 's also not that important . 
  montenegro 's economy is tiny . 
  i 'm not from switzerland myself but banking secrecy just ended on january 1st . 
  it does n't , switzerland is coloured in green . 
  semi-presidential systems are yellow . 
  [ the english version of the article also calls it a directorial system . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directorial_system ) i really like the swiss system btw . 
  it works better than most european systems . 
  i 've never heard switzerland being referred to as a parliamentary republic . 
  it has a parliament , but so has the us and it 's not parliamentary republic . 
  switzerland is usually called a [ directorial republic . 
  krabat is great . 
  ^ your ^ link ^ does n't ^ work ^ btw . 
  [ krabat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krabat_\\ ( novel \\ ) ) is a novel by otfried preu\u00dfler , a modern interpretation of a sorbian fairy tale . 
  it 's very witcher-like , read it . 
  you 'll also learn a tiny bit about [ wendish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wends ) culture which even germans know far to little about . 
  the historic background is that a croatian cavalrist was granted land in lusatia . 
  the tales about him became a fairy tale about a guy called `` krabat '' ( croat ) . 
  [ maybe this will help . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato-on-the-map/#lat=48.03756614021858&amp;lon=10.066552812500053&amp;zoom=1&amp;viewer=gmaps&amp;layer-4 ) nato only has a handful of missions going on right now . 
  most actions and deployments by `` nato troops '' are initiated by the national armies not nato . 
  to see what they are doing independent of nato look at their websites . 
  ! / dz/d5/l2dbisevz0fbis9nqseh / #z 7_b8ltl2922tpcd0im3bb1q22di0 ) nato exercises are usually announced a few months in advance . 
  [ here is a list of exercises nato did in 2016 . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_1607-factsheet_exercises_en.pdf ), 
  honestly , germans rarely care about the uk unless it has something to do with the eu or the two world wars . 
  it 's sad actually . 
  if you want to feel hated , read this [ famous poem from wwi . 
  ] ( http://behindtheirlines.blogspot.de/2016/01/hymn-of-hate.html ), 
  you 're right , that 's interesting . 
  i googled it and found this :  a poll by the barna group in 2004 found catholic ethnicity to be 60 % non-hispanic white ( generally of mixed ethnicity , but almost always includes at least one catholic ethnicity such as irish , italian , german , polish , or french ) , 31 % hispanic of any nationality ( mostly mexicans ) , 4 % black , and 5 % other ethnicity ( mostly filipinos and other asian americans , and american indians ) . 
  from what i can tell from my few visits , there 's not a lot of preaching going on in german catholic churches . 
  they do homilies which are for praising god and not for politics . 
  they also do sermons but not that often and often not during church service . 
  the sermon is an important part of pretty much every protestant church service here , especially in reformed congregations . 
  i 'm lutheran though , so i do n't know a lot about is going on there . 
  a lutheran church service pretty much always includes a sermon . 
  a passage from the holy bible is read to the congregation between the liturgy , psalms and songs ( usually the passage is determined by the calendar , i.e the same one is used every christmas , every easter etc ) . 
  the pastor uses this passage as a groundwork for his sermon . 
  the sermon is a serious issue and the pastor aims to give his churchgoers real advice for the life . 
  the sermon can be very political which i find pretty annoying sometimes . 
  my two pastors have talked a lot about refugees over the last months . 
  they probably know that their mostly old churchgoers have opinions that are pretty different from theirs . 
  most american catholics are latinos . 
  somewhat religious but not hugely . 
  edit : that 's not true . 
  that 's different . 
  `` en gros '' is of french origin , `` gros '' ( pronounced gross ) is the unit . 
  it ' still used sometimes , for eggs and things like that . 
  i 've never heard `` schock '' , that 's pretty interesting . 
  that 's good to know !, 
  if what some portugese guys told me during my vacation there is right - it 's seen in a surprisingly positive light . 
  apparently it was a quiet , stable and safe time . 
  salazar was n't a very powerhungry dictator , he did n't even show himself that much . 
  the economy was in an ok shape ( salazar had studied econ and he was apparently pretty skilled at keeping the economy in shape ) and debt was much lower than it is now . 
  they seem to have forgotten the less pleasant aspects of his rule like suppression of dissidents and all that . 
  i saw that some streets are still named after him . 
  wikipedia also says :  in 2006 and 2007 two public opinion television shows aroused controversy . 
  salazar was elected the `` greatest portuguese ever '' with 41 per cent of votes on the show os grandes portugueses ( `` the greatest portuguese '' ) from the rtp1 channel . 
  dutzend ( dozen ) zentner - this one is tricky . 
  in germany one zentner is still 50kg ( i.e. 
  about 100 pounds , because that 's where it comes from : 110 prussian pounds ) . 
  in austria and switzerland one zentner has adapted to be 100kg . 
  this is called a doppelzentner in germany ( because it was originally about 200 pounds : 220 prussian pounds ) . 
  gros - one gros is 144 things ( 12x12 - a dozen dozens ) gros is pretty rare today ma\u00df - one ma\u00df is 1l . 
  it used to be 1,069 l groschen - one groschen is 10 pfennig or 10 cents today . 
  before the introduction of the decimal system , one prussian groschen was worth 12 pfennig . 
  with the unification in 1871 the decimal currency 1 mark = 100 pfennig was introduced but the term groschen continued to be used until today . 
  pfund ( pound ) - still used for a few things here . 
  today it 's 0.5 kg . 
  it used to be 467,711 g. 
  qu\u00e4ntchen or quentchen - only in proverbs , never as a real unit . 
  it was part of the old prussian scale 1 zentner ( 51,448244 kg ) = 110 pfund = 220 mark = 3520 lot = 14080 quentchen = 63360 gr\u00e4n, 
  i know about that and i did n't mention coca cola at all . 
  the earliest mention of the weihnachtsmann is `` morgen kommt der weihnachtsmann '' written by fallersleben in the first half of the 19th century . 
  so not exactly an old tradition . 
  it is also true that the modern weihnachtsmann with his modern appearance and his coming through the chimney and all that only came to germany after the war . 
  naw , democrats do n't like him because he 's conservative . 
  that 's okay for me . 
  i would have been ok with most republican candidates , i kinda liked kasich . 
  but they had to elect the worst possible candidate . 
  hei-mat bi-hist du gro-ho-\u00dfer s\u00f6h-ne that was the old version stretched to 10 syllables as was necessary because of the tune . 
  hei-mat gro-ho-\u00dfer t\u00f6ch-ter und s\u00f6h-ne that 's the current version . 
  still 10 syllables but you only have to stretch one word instead of two . 
  it arguably fits better into the tune -, 
  it fits into the tune so i do n't see any problem here tbh . 
  there 's literally no downside to this . 
  or just stay in slovenia , berlin is not a great city . 
  30 % is not a lot . 
  frenchies and brits like him a lot more . 
  well , right now there 's the toblerone controversy in switzerland but i 'm not swiss . 
  just a while ago there was this `` zipfelmann '' controversy here in germany .
