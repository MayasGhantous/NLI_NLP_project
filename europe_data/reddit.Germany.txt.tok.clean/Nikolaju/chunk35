  in addition to chocolate santas penny sells these blue santa-like chocolate men called `` zipfelm\u00e4nner '' . 
  this gets a lot of people really riled up because those damn supermarkets want to erase our very german traditions ( nevermind that santa claus originates in the us and only really came over here after the war - in most traditional households the christ child comes instead ) . 
  a few nice quotes from the comment section of a focus article about this :  oh , yes . 
  focus and their mobbed-up coverage . 
  it is a funny example of bigotry as it is only possible by lnksgr\u00fcnversiffte . 
  if the german justly does n't want zipfelm\u00e4nner that 's hate but if the muslim wants to take our christian values away ( crucifixes in class rooms ) that 's colourful and not worthy of mention . 
  note the usage of `` the german '' and `` the muslim '' as two mutually exclusive groups , a style of speech that was only really used by the nazis to reduce all groups to one characteristic specimen you can pile your hate on . 
  also secularization of public schools is a muslim conspiracy . 
   the `` halal '' seal is missing . 
  without it those things wo n't sell among their target group . 
  note how everything has to do with muslims , even a chocolate product sold in addition to chocolate santas that originate in america . 
   only dumb sheep believe in coincidence . 
  if you believe in coincidence regarding corporations and politicians you probably believe that butterflies are flying butter . 
  nuff said . 
  many people announced that they will never again buy anything from penny . 
  i 'm pretty sure this `` discussion '' is the sole reason penny sells these things in addition to chocolate santas . 
  the amount of hate and conspiracy theories is great for pr . 
  i do n't think trade is gon na be hurt by his reputation . 
  trade is gon na be hurt by future anti-trade policy . 
  western diplomacy and europe are fucked . 
  russia and china still ca n't grasp their luck , their governments celebrated on election day while poland , denmark and the baltics are scared to death . 
  this is a huge loss for western foreign policy and every fucking nation except the us knows that . 
  he would be a mostly ceremonial head of state of a small neutral mountainous country . 
  how is the result of their election the worst thing that happened during this terrible year ? 
  o pls no, 
  most germans know about the volga germans because many of them live here in germany now . 
  as ethnic germans they have a [ right to citizenship ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9d%d0%b5%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%86%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d0%bf%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%86%d1%8b ) and a large number of them made use of that right . 
  helene schneider for example was a volga german born in siberia . 
  they seem to be the butts of many jokes but aside from that nobody seems to have a problem with them . 
  nice people , they got a fair amount of autonomy ( well , as much as you can get in extremely centralized russia ) and do their own thing . 
  russians and tatars seem very similar to me and they luckily have n't had problems with each other except for that crimea thing in 1944 when stalin deported the crimean tatar majority to make russians the majority because of the strategic importance of crimea . 
  he was n't russian himself so he obviously did n't hate the crimean tatars , they just had the bad luck of being in the way . 
  a cruel move but obviously very effective in the long run . 
  do you live in tatarstan ? 
  do you know if tatars do things like observe ramadan and celebrate festivals like eid ? 
   was he a russian or only born in russia ? 
  he was a russian , not only born there . 
  in the 90s many ethnic germans from russia ( russlanddeutsche ) migrated to germany but he was not one of those . 
  i think i get your point but it seems really impractical . 
  it would make a large portion of the world population nationless because of something they had no influence over . 
  it reduces the whole concept of a nation to blood alone and ignores aspects like culture and language . 
  so which nation do they belong to ? 
  after how many centuries can these nationless people who are probably undistinguishable from nationals be considered nationals ? 
  i grew up in germany , i 'm protestant and visit the local church , i never really left the city i was born in , i never learned another language than german in my childhood except english , latin and greek in my classical school . 
  my father was born in russia . 
  i can not possibly be a part of the german nation because of something that happened decades before i was born ? 
  americans certainly are very proud of being part of a nation . 
  their nation is held together by a shared set of values and a common homeplace . 
  you ca n't deny the existence of the american nation only because you have some quarrel with `` colonist countries '' . 
   meuse my inner child tries not to laugh every time i hear the french name of the maas . 
  that 's how tastes are different , i guess . 
  i still have a few dm coins lying around and i dislike every single eagle design on them . 
  it looks like they actively tried to avoid it looking good and like a german eagle with every design . 
  the french ones look beautiful . 
  the german motifs are simple and strong : [ oak leaves , brandenburg gate , german eagle ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/cnxdpc/german-euro-coins-arranged-in-numerical-order-rear-view-cnxdpc.jpg ), 
  i 'll start : [ pics of marburg , frankfurt , alsfeld and a few others ] ( http://imgur.com/a/fwsvv ), 
  hey , i 've heard about your town in [ this song ] ( https://youtu.be/w5z6aez6t3c?t=1m22s ) . 
  it 's one of the oldest german military songs . 
   silent night , holy night is regarded worldwide as the most famous christmas song and as the epitome of christmas traditions in the german-speaking world . 
  unesco has recognized it as an immaterial cultural heritage in austria . 
  wthout a two-front war germany would finally be on the right side of history again . 
  the coat of arms of [ zheleznogorsk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/coat_of_arms_of_zheleznogorsk.svg ) is pretty awesome . 
  it 's relatively new . 
  zheleznogorsk was built around a nuclear plant , that 's why the coa looks like that . 
  most similar ? 
  closest relations ? 
  france . 
  [ we do it in may . 
  keep in mind that this was also the first noticeable jihadist attack in germany for quite some time . 
  do you want to reinstate the kingdom of bohemia ? 
  or do you want to make an entirely new kingdom ? 
  would n't that mean taking the habsburg pretender from austria and hungary , thus preventing them from doing the same thing ? 
  you still have prague castle and the original crown jewels which is pretty nice . 
  in theory i always prefer republics because it 's the only form of government that makes sense to me from an ideological standpoint . 
  the sovereignty lies with the people , not with a dynasty . 
  dynasties with power are terrible , you probably know a few political dynasties or political dynasties . 
  reality is different though . 
  monarchs in europe do n't have any real power , but they are objects of identification and honestly , it would be more beautiful . 
  it would provide for an identification figure , for continuity , for an awesome coat of arms , for cool uniforms , for tourism . 
  i would n't mind a kaiser and the reintroduction of `` traditional duchies '' like in sweden , that do n't align with the real political divisions . 
  the titles would be entirely nominal . 
  like in england there are the [ ceremonial counties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceremonial_counties_of_england ) and the [ real counties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/counties_of_england ) . 
  the kaiser could serve as king of prussia , which would be something north germans can identify with , as in `` i 'm a citizen of the state of brandenburg but i also reside in the ceremonial kingdom of prussia , so i can be proud of being a prussian '' . 
  hesse could get back is grand duke , bavaria could get back its king etc. 
  i fail to see any downsides of this , it would be good for tourism , too . 
  most monarch residences still exist , for example the [ residence of the king of bavaria ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/thronsaal%2c_residenz_m%c3%bcnchen.jpg ) . 
  funnily enough , we are rebuilding the residence of the kaisers right now , you can even [ look at it live . 
  ] ( http://cam01.berlinerschloss-webcam.de/ ) that would also make for a cool changing of the guard ceremony with pickelhauben before the castle . 
  we also have one clear pretender , the head of the hohenzollern dynasty , unlike the dynastical mess the french have with the orl\u00e9anists and legitimists , or the russians with no pretender being able to prove that they 're actually romanovs . 
  unfortunately there 's the ewigkeitsklausel in the constitution which among other things blocks the reintroduction of the monarchy . 
  we would need to draft an entirely new constitution which is perfectly possible and guaranteed in the last article of the grundgesetz and a lot of people actually wanted to to that after the reunification . 
  still it 's a huge obstacle . 
  how is it impossible ? 
  switzerland is one of the very few countries in europe that are actually proud of being a republic and were never ruled by a single monarch before . 
  those are some great examples . 
  some of those might even be worth an extra holiday . 
  you might trigger a few poles by using the german names . 
  if so : for the poles , these are the names everyone is still using in germany , so they 're not a political statement here . 
  but they might be mistaken as a political statement in other languages so it 's better to avoid them . 
  i can only really talk about hesse because as a hessian that 's where i usually am when doing a weekend break .
