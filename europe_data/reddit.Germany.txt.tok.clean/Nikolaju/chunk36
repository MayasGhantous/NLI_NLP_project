  one of the most beautiful towns in hesse . 
  there 's [ stralsund ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7qesnej.jpg ) in the far north beyond the limes in meckpomm . 
  so you have both ? 
  that 's awesome . 
  i watch dinner for one in germany and i know about the irony of fate because of my russian father . 
  but in both countries only one of them is popular . 
  `` die republik '' ( the republic ) is often used by media and such when talking about germany . 
  `` schland '' is used by fans . 
  it 's the reason why the german patriotic circlejerk sub is called / r/schland . 
  brd is still used quite a lot . 
  that was just the official name from 1871 to 1945 . 
  germany has paid 25 billion euros in reparations to israel and individual israeli holocaust survivors . 
  we usually side with israel in the conflict and we do n't recognize palestine . 
  on the other side , our government has critized israeli settlements . 
  we have a close military cooperation , we deliver submarines that are able to fire nuclear missiles if equipped with them . 
  we also cooperate in the fields of education and environment . 
  even though antisemitism is very rare , the state of israel is not seen that positive among the population . 
  to quote wikipedia :  according to a 2013 bbc world service poll , 8 % of germans view israel 's influence as positive and 67 % view it as negative , though this was about average for the european countries surveyed . 
  however almost all polls also show that the majority of germans side with israel in the israeli-palestinian conflict because it is seen as the lesser evil . 
  while in most anglo countries far-rightist are usually pro-israel hardliners , this is not so clear in germany . 
  germany is also pretty unique in europe because many leftists are pro-israel , even a few far-left groups . 
  that 's three pictures, 
  canada , nzl and australia have over 60 million residents combined and they have their own issues , too - i do n't think free movement would be a great idea . 
  it 's an invitation for large numbers of chinese and indonesians to immigrate into schengen . 
  hey , do n't try to stop the myth of the magical limitless super-ottobahn  it 's great pr for germany . 
  it really does sound very foreign in french , like some kind of tropical dwarf-nation . 
  every french person would immediately recognize `` boh\u00e8me '' though , so if you 're actually from there ( and not from moravia or silesia ) you can say that . 
  [ they seem to have quite a lot but it 's mostly focused on us history . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askanamerican/comments/5j6mo2/how_many_history_lessons_are_mandatory_in_your/ ) i would n't be so quick to jump on the hate train . 
  because we 're comprised of a number of different tribes and former countries we have several stories and pretty much every tribe has his own . 
  that would be too long to write so i 'll only name a few : there 's the real historical figure [ arminius/hermann ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/hermannsdenkmal_statue.jpg ) , a cheruscii noble who betrayed the romans and helped stop the roman advance into germania . 
  the franks believed that following the fall of troy , 12,000 trojans led by chiefs priam and antenor moved to the don river and settled in pannonia near the sea of azov . 
  in just two generations they arrived in the late 4th century ad at the rhine . 
  in an earlier version an early king named francio serves as namegiver for the francs . 
  there 's a origin myth about the christianization of germany , the myth of the `` donareiche '' . 
  according to it , anglo-saxon missionary [ saint boniface ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/bonifacius_by_emil_doepler.jpg ) and his retinue [ cut down ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/st._boniface_cuts_down_thor%27s_oak_by_charles_robinson.jpg ) a sacred pagan tree ( the donareiche ) in hesse . 
  wood from the oak was then reportedly used to build a church at the site dedicated to saint peter . 
  the [ nibelungenlied ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/sigurd_and_brunhild_by_harry_george_theaker_1920.jpg ) kinda serves as a national myth for germany . 
  it 's about the fate of the old [ burgundians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgundians ) . 
  the founding myth of my hometown frankfurt is that when the saxons defeated charlemagne , he fled westward with his troops , only to have his path blocked by the river main . 
  suddenly , a [ deer sprang out of the forest ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/die_frankenfurt.jpg ) and crossed the river by a ford ( furt ) . 
  the franks ( franken ) followed the deer across the river and thus escaped slaughter by the saxons . 
  overjoyed at their salvation , charlemagne built a town to protect the ford . 
  this town was named frankfurt . 
  the later part of the napoleonic wars ( `` befreiungskriege '' in germany - liberation wars ) had a huge influence on german identity . 
  they started a time of german nationalism culmination in the later unification . 
  the battle of the nations ( v\u00f6lkerschlacht ) has a special place in it . 
  it was seen as the final victory in a sacred crusade against foreign oppression . 
  we have a [ huge memorial ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/v%c3%b6lki_fullsize.jpg ) dedicated to it . 
  do n't forget the [ heimskringla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heimskringla ) and the [ ynglinga saga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ynglinga_saga ) . 
  if the school has g8 ( like mine ) , latin and english both start in grade 5 . 
  latin being `` first '' does n't actually mean anything in that case . 
  i had latin as first foreign language in a classical gymnasium . 
  it 's a thing . 
   one-state solution whooo boy , a controversial one . 
  it 's terrible . 
  the borders are ugly ( and they provide a huge base for rockets and nuclear weapons deep in what is actually central europe ) , the cities are ugly ( commie blocks and they never rebuilt the old city cores like poland did ) . 
  it 's a ethnic curiosity , with russians who replaced the local population sourrounded by poles and lithuanians . 
  honestly , if they really had to take it from germany , they should have given it to poland . 
  the region has a long history of both german and polish influence , it was inhabited by both germans and masurians and belonged both to germany and to poland during its long history . 
  just annex austria and slovenia . 
   but especially this sentence has been rehabilitated some years ago other way round , it was widely used , nobody had a problem with it and it was not associated with the nazis until a [ stupid discussion ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/jedem_das_seine#auseinandersetzungen_seit_1990 ) about it started in the 90s . 
  it 's still widely used , e.g. 
  in court buildings . 
   part of germany 's leaning towards pacifism my also be rooted in the peace movement from the cold war , though . 
  it 's pretty clearly a legacy of the '68 student movement and later the peace movement in the 70s and 80s . 
  those things were still very common in the 50s and 60s . 
  in the stadiums of some backwater towns is was acceptable for the audience to sing `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' followed by the horst-wessel-lied well into the 60s . 
   the name `` adolf '' is obviously out of fashion , and so are certain traditional germanic names . 
  they seem to come into fashion again . 
  there were three friedrichs in my school class , as well as a karl and a heinrich . 
  also russlanddeutsche and sp\u00e4taussiedler like to give their children traditional names , often translated ones . 
  i personally know one eugen ( which is obviously translated from evgeny ) . 
  [ that name is extremely common among them ] ( http://www.kulturportal-russland.de/mediathek.jsp?tab=news&amp;nid=814 ) . 
  they have names like waldemar , eduard und heinrich , melitta und olga . 
  my grandfather had one until his death in the early 90s . 
  one of the few things i know about india is that south indians have a darker brown than northerners . 
  that would come unexpected . 
  only happened a few times in my entire life . 
  the last time was a few months ago . 
  a tall black guy told me that i need n't fear the devil because god will save me . 
  i 'm pretty sure he had some mental problems . 
  it did n't help that the guy was huge , the lift was extremely small , i 'm not not particularly tall and i only know very few black people . 
  have russian father , can alrady confirm for you . 
  otherwise , there 's this [ russian wikipedia article ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d1%88_%d0%b1%d1%80%d0%be%d1%82 ) about russisch brot : google translator tries : `` russish brot '' ( it . 
  russisch brot , also russischbrot - russian bread ) - german cookies in the form of latin letters . 
  baked light protein assay without the fat with the addition of cocoa . 
  the recipe also includes starch , sugar syrup and cinnamon . 
  after baking cookies covered with a thin slo\u0451m icing . 
  cookies in the form of letters and well known in austria , but called `` solitaire '' . 
  letters of biscuits and chocolate are considered in austria christmas treats . 
  those bavarian rolls look like [ laugengeb\u00e4ck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lye_roll ) . 
  laugengeb\u00e4ck is a german specialty and extremely popular here . 
  [ a german comedian made a video about it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysaqtdc-y2g ) the swabians think they invented it and the bavarians think they made it . 
  i 'm pretty sure those specific ones are [ laugenstangen ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=laugenstange&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjk0l2-3vbqahwlwbqkhdk8awuq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974 ) . 
  you can get them in every bakery here . 
  neither one is russian . 
  germany iself is the most visited , spain ( especially mallorca ) and italy are among the most visited foreign countries . 
  standing up and greeting was a standard procedure at my gymnasium and has always been .
