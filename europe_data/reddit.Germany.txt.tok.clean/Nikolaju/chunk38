  the soviet union broke up but the the original strategy of replacing the population with russians so as to secure it forever ( as happened in other important locations such as crimea ) finally worked out . 
  nowadays kaliningrad is packed with missiles right in the middle of nato . 
  russia will definitely not give it up .

  woops , you 're right . 
  there 's also [ this . 
  the richest people in germany live in the suburbs surrounding the already rich cities of munich and frankfurt . 
  the district with the highest gdp/capita in germany is starnberg near munich . 
  the district with the second highest gdp/capita is hochtaunus which borders main-taunus , the district with the 4th highest gdp/capita . 
  basically the richest people live in the rich cities munich and frankfurt and the richest of the richest leave the loud and dirty cities and buy houses in the gorgeous suburbs around them . 
  the nature around munich and the taunus is beautiful . 
  you can probably figure that the rent is exorbitantly high . 
  theresa may . 
  the uk will still be in the eu tomorrow . 
  / s joke aside , she campaigned on the remain side and the remainer tories are n't actually that bad , i might vote for someone similar to her . 
  we have a lot of pastry varieties that are eaten either during the advent or only on christmas . 
  [ christstollen ] ( http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/markt/christstollen112_v-contentxl.jpg ) ( originally from saxony ) - fruit bread containing dried fruit and often covered with powdered sugar or icing sugar a great variety of christmas cookes ( weihnachtspl\u00e4tzchen ) : [ vanillekipferl ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/vanillekipferl.jpg ) ( originally from austria and southern germany ) - small , crescent shaped biscuits withmade with ground almonds or hazelnuts and vanilla sugar [ zimtsterne ] ( http://www.frisch-kochen.de/wp-content/uploads/zimtsterne.jpg ) ( originally from swabia ) - cookies with cinnamon and almonds we have dozens of varieties of ginger bread in germany , e.g. 
  [ bethm\u00e4nnchen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/bethmaennchen1.jpg ) are originally from frankfurt ( bethmann was a city councillor of frankfurt ) . 
  they are a a pastry made from marzipan with almond , powdered sugar , rosewater , flour and egg . 
  they 're sold at the [ christmas market ] ( http://blog.carathotels.de/wp-content/uploads/frankfurt-weihnachtsmarkt-1.jpg ) here . 
  [ marzipan ] ( http://www.besserhaushalten.news/typo3temp/pics/marzipan2_anim_600x400_8320281827.gif ) ( a specialty of l\u00fcbeck ) - made out of rose water , almonds & sugar [ spekulatius ] ( http://www.mamas-rezepte.de/bilder/gross/spekulatius.jpg ) ( a specialty of the rhineland , but originally from the netherlands ) - a spiced shortcrust biscuit , extremely addicting . 
  i ate like 3 packages of them last week [ springerle ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/rezepte/43/43072/136216-960x720-springerle.jpg ) ( from swabia , franconia and bavaria ) - anise-flavored biscuits imprinted with images [ pfeffern\u00fcsse ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/fotoalben/0ca7e3de40fcdd0c7fdd3a8720ce699b/6171/full_dsc00764.jpg ) ( the most famous ones come from offenbach , the state of hesse even used to serve them at official state occasions ) are tiny spice cookies [ f\u00f6rtchen / poffertjes ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/rezepte/52/52592/149950-960x720-norddeutsche-foertchen-poffertjes.jpg ) ( a north german specialty ) are traditional pancakes in a distinctive shape of a sphere [ fr\u00fcchtebrot / adventsbrot ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/rezepte/101/101362/320973-960x720-weihnachtliches-fruechtebrot.jpg ) - sweet breat with dried fruit [ linzer augen/spitzbuben/hildabr \u00f6tchen ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/rezepte/54/54815/413220-960x720-hildabroetchen.jpg ) ( austria and southern germany ) - a pastry with ribe marmalade you can imagine that many come out of advent with a few kilos more than they would like . 
  yeah , i do n't feel special in most of reddit , but / r/europe and the like are extremely leftist in economic matters . 
  in / r/de you can get downvoted if your standpoint on economics is anywhere right of the linke . 
  in / r/europe you 're being called a neoliberal shill if your standpoint is centrist or center-right . 
  on the other side / r/europe also downvotes opinions that are remotely pro-immigration . 
  reddit europeans and european liberals do n't go well together .

  i have to plug loriot 's famous rendition of the local accents of the two politicians helmut schmidt ( hamburg-born chancellor of west germany ) and joseph ertl ( then minister of agriculture , he was bavarian ) as part of a tagesschau parody ( the tagesschau is the news of the world 's largest public broadcaster ard ) . 
  https://youtu.be/_kki2srnbea?t=3m12s the first time they show the real footage dubbed with a parody of their accents , the second time they show a cartoonized version with the real sound . 
   dialects are often seen more negatively though . 
  if someone has a heavy dialect it 's hard for people from other regions to understand them and they might get laughed at . 
  dialect is more common in the `` dritte '' though ( br , hr etc ) . 
  there are many white non-europeans and european countries do n't provide skin-color information with their statistics which makes this whole thing difficult . 
  [ this statistic ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/5/56/immigration_by_country_of_birth%2c_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb16.png ) differentiates between eu immigrants and non-eu immigrants . 
  according to the statistic , the country with the most non-eu immigrants is italy , but many of those are from the balkans ( mostly non-eu countries ) so it 's somewhat distorted . 
  other examples of countries with high non-eu immigrant percentages are spain and sweden which sounds realistic . 
  the best `` end game '' for me would be a close cooperation and common foreign policy and defense . 
  imo that 's the only way europe can provide a serious defense and remain important on the world stage . 
  i would n't like an actual unitary state/a dissolution of the member states but foreign policy and defense is an absolute necessity . 
  there was one in denmark during the 19th century when a wave of nationalism swept across denmark around the time of the first schleswig war . 
  [ you probably know this painting . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/tropper_1849.jpg ), 
  which country ? 
  blanco and r\u00f6sler are good examples . 
  blanco is a german schlagers\u00e4nger who happens to be black and r\u00f6sler is adopted . 
  helene fische is maybe not the greatest example because she is actually ethnically german and has volga german ancestors . 
  also ru\u00dfland ( with the \u00df ) and amerika . 
  they still find them handy for these kinds of statistics . 
  they could of course explain how many of those foreign-born babies are from other european countries but would the statistic still look so scary ? 
  for them ethnicity is very important . 
  some of our nationalists think that only ethnic germans have a right to live in germany , as in `` germany for the germans '' . 
  i think that 's idiotic - german is a culture , who cares about your genome ? 
  your genome does n't change anything if your already culturally geman . 
  i 'm ethnically half russian . 
  i grew up with german culture , never learned russian , never really left my hometown , i 'm protestant and one of the most patriotic germans i know . 
  from my looks nobody would ever guess i 'm not german . 
  but according to [ these people ] ( https://twitter.com/ja_deutschland/status/780636476165980160 ) ( the afd party ) i 'm part of the evil red block intended to undermine and replace the poor german people , i 'm literally what 's wrong with modern politics and i do n't belong here , even though i have nowhere else to belong . 
  i think what they should care about is culture , not genetics . 
  if all of germany were genetically asian , but all of them would be culturally german , i could n't care less about their genome . 
  oops !, 
  i do n't have many pictures myself and those 're basically selfies but these pictures i did n't take myse , f are all from the part of frankfurt i come from : http://imgur.com/a/dxpzd, 
  the weihnachtsmann is a relatively new phenomenon in germany . 
  i guess the american santa claus had some influence in that . 
  hesse is mostly baby jesus territory . 
  are you a filthy northerner ? 
  the government makes them believe there is no alternative to fidesz . 
  you will hear the same about putin if you talk to russians . 
  it 's handy , no matter how many mistakes the government makes , the people will just say it 's ok because there is no alternative . 
  https://rsf.org/en/hungary https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/hungary not looking too good . 
  that 's kinda ironic , is n't it ? 
  advocating the expulsion of a country because it has advocated the expulsion of a country . 
  they can build as many fences as they want but i 'm very worried about their civil rights situation and their dwindling political rights and freedom of press . 
   also , catholics go to their local church for the midnight mass protestants do that too , at least where i live . 
  you should mention that christmas pretty much died out during the soviet rule and today christmas and new year 's eve are practically the same for most people . 
  a lot of christmas-y things are now associated with new year 's eve . 
  i can only talk about what my family does because i do n't know about all of germany . 
  we celebrate at december 24th . 
  usually it 's just my family , not a huge number of guests . 
  we eat a lot and talk . 
  when it 's getting dark we open the presents ( they are imagined to come from baby jesus ) afterwards we attend the midnight mass. 
  the day after ( dec 25th ) we always visit a friendly family living in a small village with only 400 inhabitants . 
  they make a christmas goose and we eat together . 
  this film is a tradition in germany , too but it 's a sylvester tradition here . 
  they sure can but they do n't get elected because they lack the votes . 
  illiberal democracy is a term coined by orb\u00e1n himself to describe his autocratic style of government . 
  it has also been applied to russia and turkey .

  maybe castilian ? 
  i do n't know if they would immediately recognize that though . 
  i 'm surprised they knew about the raj , british colonial history is n't really taught here . 
  germany : yes , since 1955 and i do think it 's beneficial but i respect if countries like austria , switzerland , sweden and finland want to be neutral . 
  no , danish rule . 
  their coat of arms already marks estonia as rightful swedish clay . 
  why so hasty ? 
  unless you plan on exporting or importing huge amounts of goods it wo n't make a huge difference for you . 
  positive influence from free trade is supposed to accumulate over years . 
  most likely in 2017 . 
  should n't be more than a few months .
