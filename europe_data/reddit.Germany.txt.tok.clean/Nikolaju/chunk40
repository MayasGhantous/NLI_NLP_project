  willy mk .1 is much more popular . 
  actually the wwi historiography is a tad more complicated . 
  so we have the treaty of versailles in which the french managed to get the famous kriegsschuldklausel . 
  one of the aims of this was to make germany liable for the damages in eastern france . 
  it was also convenient for france ( many french hated germany ) to settle the question of guilt like this . 
  an [ / r/askhistorians post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3vnzt8/it_has_been_argued_that_the_blockade_of_germany/cxp83tk/ ) tries to summarize :  as article 231 of the treaty was actually written , it was never intended to be an assessment of ` war guilt ' with the criminal liability that would imply exactly , but instead a worldwide assessment of the central powers ' civil liability to the people and institutions they harmed with their execution of a brutal war of aggression . 
  the real question of how the treaty of versailles contributed to wwii is not really a question of how supposedly harsh it was , but a question of how it came to be viewed as so harsh . 
  french prime minister clemenceau certainly did n't help with pronouncements like how the problem with germans was that there were 20 million too many , but a better answer perhaps could be found in germans retaining the same attitudes towards war that justified the horrors of the schlieffen plan and the sacking of leuven to begin with . 
  between the wars the way wwi was seen in britain changed . 
  it was now seen as a prime example of the futility of war and a battle of no better empire . 
  during this time german interwar-propaganda became very influential in britain . 
  a [ post in / r/askhistorians ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/23g1px/in_your_opinion_which_was_a_bigger_cause_for_wwii/cgwod8b/ ) summarizes this pretty nicely :  there is no serious case left standing that versailles caused the second world war ; it is a zombie historical idea that refuses to die despite being comprehensively refuted by modern specialists . 
  there was a resurgence of pro-german sentiment in postwar england , which was related to the popular reaction against the extraordinary casualties and seeming pointlessness of the trench struggle . 
  john maynard keynes ' economic consequences of the peace was tremendously influential , and the weimar government skillfully manipulated international public opinion . 
  this has led to the widespread acceptance of any number of myths about versailles . 
  after wwii when germany and france tried to create a lasting friendship politicians agreed on settling the question by saying that as you said , the complete system of europe was at fault for wwi and nobody was the good guy , but all were just equally bad . 
  this was of course very convenient because it ended serious actual discussion about it and post-war europe was tired of discussing old things and wanted to move on . 
  now in 1961 german historian fritz fischer came along . 
  he was the first historian to have full access to the entire remaining german wwi archives . 
  previous historians had only been able to access heavily edited archives that had been created in order to support the view that war was the inevitable product of the breakdown of international diplomacy , rather than the end result of german expansionist ambitions . 
  in a nutshell his famous ( or infamous ) fischer thesis stated that wwi was basically a war of german aggression and germany could have very much not started it . 
  fischer was extremely controversial but he did manage to revitalize the discussion that was quenched after wwii . 
  this discussion is still going on . 
  american historian tried to summarize in 1991 :  it is certainly not true , however , that the views of the fischer school have come to be almost universally shared , either inside germany or out . 
  the older interpretations of people like pierre renouvin , bernadotte schmitt , and luigi albertini -- which , while quite critical of germany , never went so far as to claim that the german government deliberately set out to provoke a general war -- are still very widely accepted . 
  basically i fear that your teacher presented you one side of the argument without telling you that the other side is equally influential among historians and that historiography did n't just end after wwii . 
  afaik there are two concepts of a democratic deficit in the eu . 
  one being an internal deficit . 
  that means some people say the eu can not be really democratic because of its size and its nature as a supranational organization . 
  i do n't think that 's true myself . 
  the other is a structural deficit . 
  that means the eu has a democratic deficit because the main power lies with the commission and not the democratic parliament . 
  the obvious solution would be to strengthen the parliament . 
  i do n't think that would be a good idea , though . 
  if we strengthen the parliament and weaken the commission we delegate more power from the states to the eu . 
  i do n't want that and i doubt most eu citizens want to delegate more power . 
  so imo the main conflict is between more democracy vs. more state power . 
  oh , i definitely agree . 
  i wrote pretty much the same thing [ 2 days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/59qb5g/the_exorcism_of_ein_reich/d9c18cd/ ) . 
  it just got me thinking what other people from other places in europe think about it . 
  oh , i definitely agree . 
  i wrote pretty much the same thing [ yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/59qb5g/the_exorcism_of_ein_reich/d9c18cd/ ) . 
  it just got me thinking what other people from other places in europe think about it . 
  oh , you 're right . 
  i forgot that detail . 
  i actually meant the ussr internal borders because that is one huge complicated mess ( crimea , eastern ukraine , chechnya etc ) . 
  i changed the header . 
  so you think you could do it better this time ? 
  i 'm kinda interested , how do slovenians generally think of yugoslavia ? 
  do they hate having been a part of it ? 
  i thought about including that but op wrote :  i know that ave maria is in german , but i am thinking more those songs that are just `` casually '' sung in churches , at weddings , baptisms , funerals , or just at normal services on a sunday . 
  i like protestant hymns [ ein feste burg ist unser gott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e969xwha91e&amp;index=27 ) was written by luther himself . 
  [ nun danket alle gott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_a20qxy14s&amp;index=12 ) is another popular protestant hymn . 
  [ lobet den herren ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsskg0oswci ) is both protestant and catholic . 
  [ gro\u00dfer gott , wir loben dich ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2asgigngbz8 ) is catholic . 
  some beautiful christmas songs are [ vom himmel hoch , da komm ich her ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqmrqf8gd9u ) , also written by luther , [ es ist ein ros entsprungen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0bcqjlcgm4 ) , [ ihr kinderlein kommet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjrsqkbp-ao ) and [ o du fr\u00f6hliche ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqnisvlm_p4 ) . 
  these are the most beautiful i personally know . 
  i have heard all of these songs at least once during sunday service . 
  out of the non-german church songs [ b\u00f3g si\u0119 rodzi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua1e9xgex34 ) is probably my favorite . 
  you should have mentioned [ b\u00f3g si\u0119 rodzi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua1e9xgex34 ) . 
  you know it 's gorgeous . 
  [ rude . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gaoismvmay ), 
  probably 1 , maybe 2 . 
  i 've never in my life heard about someone who does n't know that germany exists and that it is in central europe . 
  it also helps that we have one undisputed name and no holland/netherlands thing or england/uk/gb . 
  also pretty much everyone knows about our 20th century history . 
  our actions in the first half of it have made us very well-known on the international stage . 
  the weirdest thing i 've ever heard from a foreigner about germany is that he did n't know that germany has a coastline . 
  by left-wing he probably means the economy . 
  european `` rednecks '' , i.e. 
  uneducated ( often elder ) rural people are usually ultra-conservative and very `` socialist '' by american measures . 
  so do n't let yourself be fooled by the term left-wing . 
  most of these people will probably find a lot of common ground when talking to american rednecks about immigration or lgbt people . 
  oh , it definitely is . 
  i did n't know about the strasbourgeoise , it 's enchantingly beautiful . 
  we learned in history about how furious the french were about the loss of elsass-lothringen but it 's a different thing to hear it in a song with so angry lyrics . 
  we have a similar song about the war against the french on the western front , the [ argonnerwaldlied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awrm-f4z3t0 ) . 
  it 's also very clear why the strasbourgeoise is so sad and the german `` equivalent '' ( i.e. 
  the most famous anti-french song ) die [ wacht am rhein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkrs4rl6pw ) is so happy . 
  they both were most popular between 1870 and wwi . 
  well , you have it back now , the alsacians have minority rights and the border is gone so i guess it turned out best . 
  i can tell you that they are also very much a german phenomenon . 
  ask a schoolkid and they will tell you at least ten surrender jokes each . 
  they 're mostly referencing wwii . 
   mu isamaa armas ( `` my fatherland dear '' ) , which incidentally shares a tune with the national anthem of micronesia through a german folk song . 
  the german song is `` ich hab mich ergeben '' and the cdu originally wanted to make it the national anthem of the frg . 
  - [ lili marleen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzav4hsp5wu ) is a schlager song that gets a lot of people really sentimental about the country . 
  it 's probably the most popular schlager song out there and marlene dietrich is iconic . 
  if you want to go to a volksfest and sing a song , chances are lili marleen will be played . 
  very simple lyrics , it 's about a soldier remembering his loved one . 
   outside the barracks , by the corner light  i 'll always stand and wait for you at night  we will create a world for two  i 'll wait for you the whole night through  for you , lili marlene  for you , lili marlene - [ die gedanken sind frei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmwta9qrq0o&amp;index=26 ) plays a similar role . 
  it 's one of the most famous student song . 
  it 's about the freedom of thought and played a role as a patriotic song as well as being famously played by resistance leader sophie scholl in front of the prison where her father was detained for criticizing hitler . 
   thoughts are free , who can guess them ? 
   they fly by like nocturnal shadows . 
   no man can know them , no hunter can shoot them  with powder and lead : thoughts are free !, 
  - [ der gute kamerad \\ ( `` the good comrade '' \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1yrwddqtzy&amp;index=15 ) , is a traditional lament of the german armed forces . 
  it 's basically our version of taps . 
  it 's played at volkstrauertag and every military burial .
