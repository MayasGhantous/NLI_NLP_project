   anyway , you do n't have to pay us reperations , only apologize for second world war and according to me we will be bff . 
  according to that measure poland and the frg would have been best friends since the 1970s , despite 24/7 apologies it 's still not really the case ( which has more to do with the german government acting like an ass towards the eastern eu tbf ) . 
   `` it is no more than the germans walking into their own backyard . '',

  where are the villages in hungary ? 
  also the territory reaching to the memel river ( august\u00f3w voivodeship ) was part of congress poland from 1815-1867 ( 52 years , not 8 ) . 
  if you go with the incorporation in 1832 it would still be 17 years . 
  it was part of the duchy of warsaw for about 8 years , but it remained part of congress poland . 
  of course they do . 
  why would n't they ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mtufy/samsung_snubs_london_in_favour_of_berlin_because/dk4v1pa/ the same is happening in eastern germany where immigrants are n't really a factor . 
  overall , birth rates are rising the most in the low-immigrant regions in eastern europe . 
  from that article :  germans 360 116 ( 2.12 % ) i 'm thinking you meant 10 % of the immigrant population . 
  360 116 germans out of 3 752 291 immigrants - it would fit that way . 
  source ? 
  foreign-born residents make up about 11 % of the dutch population so germans making up 10 % of the dutch population would be quite odd . 
  not sure where you got this from . 
  the largest minority are turks with 2.34 % of the population . 
  germans are 2.12 % of the population .

  we need to scrap the paris agreement immediately without substitution . 
  of course it 's not the large big war , this is not the end of history . 
  this is the agreement janukovych did n't sign . 
  but sld is a small party in all age groups and no one with commie nostalgia would vote for po . 
  this does n't seem like a satisfactory explanation , especially for why 35-44 years old people seem to love po so much while their sld bar is n't even visible . 
  all of this is very unusual for someone who is used to western age-vote patterns . 
  why do older people dislike pis so much compared to other age groups ? 
  why do people from 35-44 years stand out so much ? 
  and why does po not only have less , but basically no support from very young people while this is n't the case for people just a little older ? 
  edit : so if i summarize , it has something to do with different newssources and personal experiences of communism ? 
  yeah , i do n't think you 're shocking anybody here by calling the holocaust a genocide . 
  that 's like calling hitler a bad guy . 
   igloo fish fingers sold in slovakia have a lower fish content ( 58 % ) than the same branded product in austria ( 65 % ) but products sold in the uk , netherlands and portugal also have 58 % . 
  `` the product is different but no evidence of an east-west divide , '' he said in a presentation . 
   studies have detected no substantial variation between milka chocolate in the czech republic and germany , a finding corroborated by your columnist 's personal taste tests and by the respective lists of ingredients . 
  charlemagne 's commitment to journalistic rigour did not extend to sampling hipp 's baby food , but the company confirms that its products are identical on either side of the border . 
  same with other products . 
  they 're cherrypicking two specific countries here to make it look like an east-west divide , exaggerate the problem , create an outrage and gain votes . 
  the whole issue is ridiculous and only serves to distract from domestic policy problems in these countries . 
  the eu has no moral duty to participate in political pr stunts for local election campaigns in eastern europe . 
   2000 comments ( 1000 new ) well , it never gets boring . 
   1000 comments huh, 
  [ the official `` white '' of the polish flag looks grey on screens . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_poland ) grey poland was actually banned from the sub a while ago . 
  just searched , it 's a / u/jpaolo comic from lesser known september . 
  so yes , poland is grey and that 's the reason there 's no russia . 
  do i spy a grey poland there ? 
   i heard they 're making money from the russia sanctions . 
  theoretically eu & co do n't trade with russia ... but they do with belarus . 
  and belarus trades with russia . 
  rumor has it that they 're exporting things like shrimp that 's `` so totally fished in belarus '' and similar . 
  yep . 
  `` belarusian cheese '' is all the rage in russia . 
  wait , come and see is belarusian ?

  note how the people in the inner circles dante mentions are politicians from dante 's time . 
  or just any politicians, 
  each of the post-communism governments was democratically elected , do n't act like this one is the only one that does `` what people want '' just because it 's the one you like most . 
  this government has an opposition , as did every government before it . 
  churchill too agreed to potsdam and yalta . 
  indeed he had already made a deal on partitioning europe in spheres before the americans even knew of it . 
  this is a french propaganda postcard from 1942 . 
  vichy france was officially neutral but in most ways a german puppet . 
  all the european countries ( italy , france etc ) go the `` right '' way together with germany , only some are hesitant like neutral switzerland and sweden . 
  only the uk is walking into the american jew trap out of pure spite . 
  it 's antisemitic and promotes the nazi german war effort . 
  it 's pretty much a translation of latin * patria * , a female word that comes from * pater * , father . 
  about nato :  as for germany 's interests in russian gas , yes of course it 's there . 
  but given that eeu has reasonable cause to be worried about russia and its influence/possible blackmailing , it looks like germany is just ... selling them out . 
  i fear it is . 
  germany is putting its personal interests before the security interests of eastern eu members . 
  you could make a `` germany first '' out if it but you do n't gain the majority 's support in germany if you openly admit that . 
  and nato is really unpopular with the majority . 
  every raising of the military budget , every military exercise with german participation gets criticized by some as anti-russian warmongering . 
  and the policy you 're seeing right now , the policy of the political center in germany - that 's the most pro-nato policy you 'll get . 
  both the far right and the far left despise nato and want to get closer to russia . 
   `` hurr durr taking our jobs !, 
  why are you complaining , you have no right to complain because you 're europoor and we 're paying you ! '', 
  tbf , one of these is not like the other . 
  the western european countries that criticize poland and hungary do n't really have anything against immigration from eastern europe . 
  and relations with other eastern eu members that are not poland or hungary are quite good . 
  and i think this goes both ways : i absolutely see the problem but i would n't put the sole blame on the western eu members while some other eu members abuse their anti-eu rhetoric to gain votes while simultaneously enjoying its economic benefits . 
  when west eu criticizes east eu it 's usually because of intra-eu issues , not because they 're not not doing enough for the west or nato . 
  trump does n't care much about intra-eu issues but he does care about strategic ones . 
   but it appears that in this case , our interests ( and even safety ) align better with usa than the west eu . 
  this has been the case since the fall of communism in eastern europe . 
  do n't forget about the whole `` old europe/new europe '' thing . 
  american presidents praising eastern europe is not something new . 
  germany does n't care particarly about nato because russia is n't really a threat for us but it does care for the wellbeing of its citizens ( remember , in 1989 only about 20 % of west germans wanted a united germany to remain in nato , in east germany the percentage was likely much smaller ) . 
  expensive gas makes every german 's life harder and hurts our economy . 
  even with lng terminals us gas ca n't replace the russian gas supply at the same price . 
  germany would be acting against his own interests if it endangered its gas supply from russia . 
  i was actually referring to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/600euro/ ) and the widespread conspiracy theory that leftist rioters get paid by the government for rioting . 
  but i looked up the history of the extremismusklausel , found above quote and found it really funny .
