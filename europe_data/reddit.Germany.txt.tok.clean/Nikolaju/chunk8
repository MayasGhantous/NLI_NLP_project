  conservative brits ( mostly older ) * did * see eastern europeans ( and yes , they do see poland as eastern european ) as part of a larger `` migration crisis '' . 
   poland , hungary , czech republic for not toeing the line . 
  they are almost always `` toeing the line '' . 
  i get it . 
  that 's the exact opposite to hurting national feelings . 
  i would have expected germany to be worse . 
  savadz, 
  do n't forget jersey , guernsey and liechtenstein with their black plates . 
  i had a nice holiday , actually . 
  loved it . 
  only the heat was a bit too much . 
  because we come from the snowy permafrost plains of northern europe and would give literally everything to see the sun . 
  sorry , did n't know that . 
  that makes sense . 
  i was in c\u00f3rdoba last summer , it was slightly over 40 degrees . 
  wo n't repeat that . 
  unless it 's about immigration or security that 's not for the state to judge . 
  no , `` wow '' because the huge number of immigrants to poland . 
  poland 's immigration rate is twice as high as its emigration rate . 
  our car producers lack innovation , so we can use some competition . 
  and our trade surplus is too high anyway . 
  the evzones used to have small blades on their shoes to stomp them into others ' bodies , use for example in the independence war against the turks . 
  they 're hidden by those bobbles ( the blades are not there anymore i think but the bobbles are ) . 
  the skirts have 400 folds , representing 400 years of turkish oppression ended by the independence war . 
  him, 
  they 're not goose-stepping at all and i do n't think they have to try not to because it 's actually pretty hard and requires a lot of practice . 
  wow , poland . 
  i know , op said that . 
  it also helps that they never lost their statehood . 
  ca n't old things be godawful ? 
  i know a few people ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_military_units_and_formations_in_continuous_operation spain has some of the oldest military units in the world . 
  is it possible than poles mainly think about russia when being asked about foreign policy ? 
  so merkel going against russia ( except when it touches on the gas supply to germany ) is a good thing in poles ' eyes . 
  it 's just a joke . 
  they the smallest non-city state and we like to pick on them . 
  [ it can be quite beautiful , actually .

  i do n't think the king was responsible for the country 's economy . 
  those are normal reference points for the church year . 
  that 's how you do it . 
  today it 's about 50/50 protestants/catholics , but it used to be two thirds protestants and one third catholics , so about twice as much protestants than catholics . 
  this only changed after the war when protestant east germany became atheist . 
  the catholic minority party * zentrum * was one of the most important political parties before the war . 
  am hessian , enjoying my 4-day weekend right now , 
  the protestant church was n't abolished in east germany , too . 
  it 's the sub-carpathian rus , a former part of the kingdom of hungary , then a part of czechoslovakia . 
  czechoslovakia `` voluntarily '' gave it to the ukrainian ssr after the war . 
  it 's inhabited by rusyns/ruthenians , a very small people who speak an east slavic language . 
  it has a significant hungarian minority , which is part of why it was annexed by hungary in ww2 ( and lost immediately after ) . 
  i actually know a hungarian from uzhhorod . 
  yeah , why not ? 
  they brought blond hair to the spanish , that got ta be worth something , right ? 
  there 's brunei , in a way the vatican 's muslim cousin .

  happy russia day !, 
    also , 30 years ago reagan made the `` tear down this wall '' speech in berlin and that 's a happy day for germany !, 
  well , maybe not the day itself , but what followed . 
   most children of prussians come to klaip\u0117da / memel to see how their predecessors lived . 
  they should come to masuria , it 's gorgeous . 
   it 's not about germany , it 's about us - lithuanians . 
  ah , ok . makes sense , i guess . 
  not bad . 
   if they did , that would cause same shit storm as fyrom does i do n't think so . 
  very few germans , mostly very old people , identify as prussians . 
  the rest would n't care . 
  i do n't know if there would be any kind of reaction by germany other than `` whatever '' . 
  in any case not the hassle the greeks have with the whole issue . 
  masurians were also a substiantial minority . 
  they are/were descendants of masovian settlers invited to settle southern east prussia . 
  nearly 100 % of east prussians left for germany at some time . 
  either directly or a few years later ( like most masurians ) . 
  to go against the circlejerk a bit : honestly , to go with a variation of this it should have been a name at least somewhat popular , or a name fyromians have used for their nation . 
  at the moment it sounds to fyromians like slovenia should name itself [ drava ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/banovine_jugoslavia.png ) or croatia should be renamed sava - no one is used to it , it 's never been used as a name for the nation itself . 
  it 's just a name of a river . 
  you still have that agreement with the state of hamburg but it 's not used that often anymore . 
  they were never serious . 
  and the house of commons is worse than a childrens ' class . 
  there are more unflattering pics of him . 
  in this one he 's looking pretty normal , just opening his mouth while speaking, 
   right leaning forums such as this . 
  wut also georgia being in europe or not is not a settled issue . 
  because of a similar system , yeah . 
  it 's a bit unclear . 
  some say no , some say yes . 
  it 's kinda both . 
  they do n't feel asian but they are if the caucasus is your definition of europe 's southern border . 
  it 's astonishing how much better people can look with a pet or a young child in their arms . 
  unionists do n't want snp to call yet another indy ref so they do tactical voting . 
  which in most constituencies means voting tory . 
  well , since the ~ ~ anschluss ~ ~ reunification we also have this [ better ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/eingang_deutsche_nationalbibliothek_leipzig.jpg ) looking building in [ leipzig . 
  ] ( http://www.rund-blick-leipzig.de/tl_files/bilder/deutsche_nationalbibliothek/_mg_5376-panorama_1240x510px_web.jpg ), 
  you 're on a roll today , eh ? 
  depends . 
  is your neigbourhood 's library good ? 
  losing wars ? 
  that 's not what i 'm talking about . 
  it looks like northern ireland managed to grab all of ulster .
