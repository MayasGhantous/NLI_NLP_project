  [ reading room of the german national library . 
  ] ( http://www.buchreport.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/dnb_frankfurt_main_lesesaal.jpg ) after the presidential bureaus i 'm smelling a pattern here . 
  wtf happened to northern ireland . 
   prague is another neat city on the danube pardon ? 
  they did say it was in the early 00 's . 
  prague has been one of the most important central european cities for most of his time , the jewel of the hre . 
  czechoslovakia then ended up in communist `` eastern europe '' for a few decades which is annoying czechs to this day . 
  [ different point of view . 
  [ i have it from here . 
  ] ( http://www.bundespraesident.de/de/die-amtssitze/schloss-bellevue/schloss-bellevue-node.html ) the document you can download that includes some of the pics features gauck , so i would guess it is gauck 's setup . 
  that sounds so easy but the czech-german conflict was already a thing throughout the 19th century and it did n't really get better , especially now that all of them had that air of collaboration around them . 
  i know a german moravian myself , known him for all of my life ( in fact he 's several times older than me and will probably not make it for long ) . 
  he was born in olomouc and sometimes he tells of the fights he got into even as a child with the czechs in the city . 
  always forming different football teams , fistfights were always german boys against czech boys , things like that . 
  the conflict was there and he ca n't remember it ever being different . 
  he was expelled as an 18 year old boy together with his mother after serving one year as a * volkssturm * boy , so while he grew up and became the person he is in czechoslovakia he 's lived most of his life in germany , where he found a second home with several other moravians in bavaria . 
  i think that 's another aspect : completely aside from the moral complications ( it was wwii after all and the germans literally tried to wipe the czech people from existence ) czechoslovakia lost millions of people that could have helped rebuilding the economy and basically gifted them to germany where they helped the * wirtschaftswunder * . 
  do n't czechs prefer a czech sudetenland ? 
  what do czechs think of the bene\u0161 decrees ? 
  do you think it would have been possible to czechify the population and keep them in the country as france did in alsace ? 
  differences between the governments of both contituent nations . 
  tl ; dr : they were too lazy to seek a solution that works for both and just kinda said `` fuck it '' . 
  merkel herself has complained about the excessive size of her office . 
  the whole complex is several times the size of the white house . 
  thanks for the answer , 
  it also seems to correspond with the former ethnically serbian area - are there reasons for that ? 
  source ? 
  i 've never heard of that . 
  tbf you 're like 99 % water and have turkey as a neighbour . 
  `` not allowed '' !, 
  do you know how expensive carriers are ? 
  we do n't have one because we have no use for a carrier as a nation with literally one island on the high seas , a short coastline and no overseas territories . 
  japan as an island nation has recognized the need to maintain heli carriers but what are we supposed to do with something like that ? 
  well , tschechien and tschetschenien sound pretty different . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  one of the goals of maintaining a functional military is discouraging armed conflict . 
  armed conflict itself is supposed to be a last resort . 
  sure . 
  it also creates employment . 
  it 's not so bad but it 's also really , * really * expensive and has been so even before the crisis . 
  it 's also incredibly expensive . 
  * responsible for his own relatively short and painless death . 
  i do n't think he 'd preferred to be hanged or decapitated the old-fashioned way . 
  be russia try to land in meck-pomm first thing to see are nudist beaches filled with east german retirees turn back horrified and never return, 
  the 2 % target is something we negotiated with america . 
  before anyone else 's gon na say it : yes , a large part of the helicopters is not fully operational at the moment . 
  we * are * increasing our military budget every year with the goal of reaching 2 % one day , though . 
  maybe we 'll manage to clean up this mess . 
  i do n't know . 
  you can call yourself whatever you want , that does n't change that applying the modern concept of russian ethnicity to an early medieval east slavic principality is just wrong . 
  it 's a fact that the meaning of the word has changed and it would be dishonest to act otherwise . 
   a federation ( also known as a federal state ) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions . 
   kievan rus ' ( old east slavic : \u0420\u0479\u0301\u0441\u044c ( rus ' ) , \u0420\u0479\u0301\u0441\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0467 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0467 ( rus ` skaya zemlya ) , ancient greek : \u1fec\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 , latin : rus ( s ) ia , ruscia , ruzzia , rut ( h ) enia , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] old norse : gar\u00f0ar\u00edki ) was a loose federation [ 4 ] of east slavic tribes in europe from the late 9th to the mid-13th century , [ 5 ] under the reign of the rurik dynasty . 
  the modern peoples of belarus , ukraine , and russia all claim kievan rus ' as their cultural ancestors . 
  [ 6 ] the romans also spoke of the `` germani '' and `` germania '' , yet equating this with modern-day germany would be unhistorical . 
  kievan rus is a term coined in the 19th century , but so are `` russian '' and `` ukrainian '' as ethnicities . 
  of course the words existed before , but they did n't refer to the same thing they do today . 
  the kievan rus was a federation of east slavic principalities . 
  the languages they spoke evolved to ukrainian , russian , belorussian and rusyn . 
  `` russian '' and `` ukrainian '' as ethnicities are modern inventions that have nothing to do with the kievan rus . 
  saying that kiev was `` ethnically russian '' means applying a term coined in the 19th and 20th centuries to the early middle ages . 
  t h e s p i c e m u s t f l o w, 
  well , it ca n't be this year that is depicted here :(, 
  i got that but could you please choose a comment that actually touches on the issue to reply with your political opinion on this topic ? 
  i literally just said `` chechnya would like to have a talk with you '' . 
  i 'm not sure if you replied to the right comment because i no way i implied that this is russia 's fault or that muslims are harmless or anything . 
  i just left a short comment pointing out that some people ( see chechnya ) are indeed so homophobic as to persecute homosexuals because op said that was ridiculous . 
  if anything i was supporting your point . 
  i have the feeling you 're talking to someone else . 
  might be a special permission by the state government idk . 
  or the city council has the power to do this , i do n't really understand how that works . 
  in any case it 's unusual . 
  i think you 're missing my point again . 
  i listed chechnya because that `` no one would be so homophobic as to ... '' comment is proven wrong by the very topic of this thread and i wanted to point that out . 
  i did n't say anything about anything other than that . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  [ this was s\u00e8vres . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/treatyofsevres_%28corrected%29.png ) maybe it 's comparable to hungary putting up a fight against trianon . 
  it 's usually translated as `` independence war '' even if that 's not completely accurate . 
  oh yeah , sure . 
  i just wanted to comment on the `` no one would be so homophobic as to ... '' and since it 's the topic of the post listing chechnya made the most sonse to me . 
  i never wanted to say anything about the rest of the world . 
  and i do n't really see how that 's anti-russian . 
  chechnya * is * muslim and kadyrov is n't putin . 
   no one is homophobic enough to want to prosecute people chechnya would like to have a talk with you , 
  the leftists liberal revolutionaries that wrote and sang this song also liked to wear rogatywkas ( usually called konfederatkas here ) as a sign of spite and solidarity with the poles . 
  there was a serious discussion about whether to give back the province of posen to poland . 
  they romanticized the oppressed poles in a similar way today 's leftists sometimes romanticize kurdistan . 
  eh , there are some aspects you really do n't need to replicate . 
  i know about the historical definition . 
  czechia and slovenia proving their non-eastern-europeanness as usual < 3, 
  it 's not really an unpopular opinion , it 's already the case is several european countries ( germany and italy for example ) . 
  also russia . 
  top post is a political post featuring drag queen putin ( as if putin would care about this ) . 
  especially european history that is happening right now ;(, 
  love those descriptions . 
  it 's a good thing that it 's not `` common sense '' anymore or germany would try warring france and poland . 
  imagine german schools teaching about everything east of oder and nei\u00dfe being rightful german clay , the only difference being that those territories actually spoke german before the war . 
  compared to the rest of europe , not really . 
  more eurosceptic than the continent and maybe more xenophobe , but not more racist .
