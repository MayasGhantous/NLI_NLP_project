  it is a sort of half truth in that yes , 17 times as much is pretty bad , but rape is such a rare crime that it is still an incredibly small part of the population . 
  sure it needs to be addressed , because every single incidence is terrible , but people who use these statistics usually want to put the entire country into detention centers for it . 
  because that has always worked so well on the us/mexico border . 
  well you started it with the whole `` what about other european countries ? 
  '' , `` what about isis ? '' . 
  you ca n't whatabout those , but completely ignore the whatabouts of the other side . 
  china and nk have communist economies , but they are very much on the nationalist side regarding social and foreign policy . 
  just ask tibet and south korea . 
  the government . 
  each refugee gets 143 $ allowance on top of their basic necessities + bureaucracy . 
  let 's just assume it 's 500 $ per refugee per month . 
  there are 800,000 refugees expected in 2015 , so that means 800000x500 $ x12 = 4.8 b $ it 's not nothing , but considering we 're potentially saving the lives of several hundreds of thousands of people and germanies gdp is 3.3 t $ and we 've just spend over [ 5.2 b $ on a defective airport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_brandenburg_airport ) , i say that 's a pretty good price . 
   so if germany were to import nazis , you would take that as a positive development ? 
  no  importing 90 % able bodied men from countries where rape is a very positive thing ` what can go wrong ' ? 
  we 're not importing them , they 're fleeing to us . 
  also we 're talking about refugees , not migrants . 
  and if you think rape is considered a `` very positive thing '' anywhere in the world , you are an idiot . 
  find me any country where it 's punished with less than a prison sentence . 
   rotherham was a positive development . 
  no it was n't , but that 's anecdotal evidence . 
  the catholic church 's child rape scandal happened around the same time and that is also not indicative that being catholic makes you more likely to rape someone . 
   shari'ah controlled zones a positive development . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  [ that stupid fox news report ? 
  ] ( http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/nogozones.asp )  women getting raped en masse in sweden ? 
  positive development . 
  now that is actual data !, 
  except your conclusion is totally wrong . 
  women are n't getting raped `` en masse '' . 
  rape is still an extremely rare crime . 
  and just as a side note , i never said positive development , i only said `` no negative developments '' . 
  there has been no developments either way , even with 3000 refugees in a shelter build for 700 people in a village with 8000 inhabitants . 
  i for one am glad when arsons do n't get everything they want . 
  well , if you 're gon na look at it world wide and include isis , you also need to include north korea , china and russia on the right wing side . 
  except they are n't a negative development . 
  i live next to one and nothing is `` developing negatively '' . 
  tell that to the homeless person who ran out of my local supermarket with a bag of cookies last month . 
  italy and spain will just let them starve at this point . 
  germany is one of the few places left that can provide them even basic necessities . 
   locals are pissed off , politicians call everyone racist and then live nowhere near refugee centers or muslim neighborhoods . 
  they live in delusion . 
  in the village next to me there is a massive refugee shelter and it has n't affected me at all . 
  the most `` refugee critical '' people live in regions with basically no immigration . 
  those are the deluded ones . 
  there 's a difference between stealing to have something to eat and burning down a refugee shelter , because of a weird phantasie that the refugees are here to ruin the country . 
   kill merkel  burn cdu/csu  kick out bavaria it 's like the german version of  lawyer up  hit the gym  delete facebook, 
  fuck you , we have motherfucking g\u00f6ttingen !, 
  your average scientist is n't going to cry over this , but think of the people who actually work there . 
  they raised millions ( billions ? ), 
  of dollars from the government , built this huge highly advanced ring 100m underground , a massive structure made from the most advanced technology we have and then programmed it and then you switch it on and it works and confirms that a prognosed particle actually exists . 
  just [ look at this thing ] ( http://home.web.cern.ch/sites/home.web.cern.ch/files/styles/medium/public/image/experiment/2013/01/cms_0.jpeg?itok=ee9bxv0e ) . 
  that 's just a small part of the whole system . 
  now imagine you built part of that . 
  it 's pretty much incomprehensible that it works at all . 
  1000 $ for each eu citizen or [ 1.8 % of the gdp of the euro zone ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28greek+debt%29+%2f+%28gdp+of+euro+zone%29 ) it would definitely be a blow to the economy , but it 's really nothing europe could n't stomach . 
  and we would n't even need to pay all of it . 
  the thing is , victoria was a major part of the ama process and she was fired without any warning . 
  imagine your supervisor at your job was suddenly replaced tomorrow and nobody told you about it and you do n't even get the ressources to do your job properly , despite them being easy to implement and you 've been asking for it for years and your also not getting paid , even though you basically run the place . 
  i 'd be pretty pissed , too . 
  that still makes it sound like you think the school is bending over for them , as if the refugees requested this . 
  especially with the  `` get f ' & % d , this is my country and i 'll dress as i damned well please ! '', 
  it sounds like you 're addressing the refugees with that . 
  not saying that was your intention , but your post is a bit ambiguous and with all the people blaming the syrians in this thread i misinterpreted you . 
  i love how everyone is assuming the refugees demanded this or something . 
  there was absolutely no indication that this was really a necessary request . 
  the school is just being overly cautious and reactionary . 
  the syrians did n't request this , you know ? 
  this is entirely the school being overly reactionary and afraid . 
  there was no indication the refugees were going to do anything . 
  that 's a quote from a politician who did n't want to have his name printed in the newspaper . 
  that seems highly doubtfull to me . 
  i do n't think the refugees had any say in this . 
  it seems to me like this is an overreaction by the school , because they are afraid something might happen , even though there is no direct indication the refugees would do anything . 
  source ? 
  also , does n't that have more to do with economic status rather than religion if that 's the case ? 
  where are non-muslims even fleeing from ? 
  edit : sure !, 
  let 's all downvote the idiot who wants a source for a claim like that !, 
   muslims are over represented in sexual crimes across europe do you have a source for that ? 
  i actually did statistical inference and not a hypothesis test . 
  i do n't even know how you could do a hypothesis test here , because noone even gave a hypothesis . 
  also : 0.485361 < =p < = 0.990479 is that what you call highly significant ? 
  that 's more than a 50 % range for the probability and it seems pretty reasonable to me . 
  if you survey 10 people and 9 say `` yes '' , you can say with 95 % confidence , that the probability of someone saying yes would be 48 % , but unfortunately you picked them at random so that only 1 said `` no '' . 
  apart from that , the formula starts breaking down with extremely small sample sizes like 10 , especially if you assume a 93 % observed probability , like you do in your example . 
  let 's get into the math here , shall we ? 
  the mathematical model for these kinds of surveys is called a [ bernoulli process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernoulli_process ) . 
  if each person has a probability p to answer yes to a certain question and you ask n people , you have an expected value of \u00b5 = n * p and a standard deviation of \u03c3 = sqrt ( n * p * ( 1-p ) ) . 
  we also now that abs ( x-\u00b5 ) \u2264 z * \u03c3 , where z is the [ confidence coefficient or z-score ] ( https://secure.surveymonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sample-size-calculation-z-scores.png ) and x is the result of a bernoulli process . 
  you can read this equation as `` in < confidence level of z-score  % of all cases , the deviation from the mean ( abs ( x-\u00b5 ) ) will be less than z * \u03c3 . 
  this technically only holds true for standard distributions , but they approximate bernoulli distributions extremely well , as long as \u00b5  3 . 
  so let 's pick z = 1.96 for 95 % confidence and solve for p . we can now say with 95 % confidence , that : ( look under solutions and click approximate form ) [ at least 89 % agree with `` one should be open towards all religions '' ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28.93*n-p*n%29^2%3c%3d1.96^2*p*%281-p%29*n+where+n%3d322+solve+for+p+ ) [ at least 80 % say that every religion is founded on a true core . 
  ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28.85*n-p*n%29^2%3c%3d1.96^2*p*%281-p%29*n+where+n%3d322+solve+for+p+ ) [ at least 85 % of muslims have regular contacts to non-muslims in their free time ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28.9*n-p*n%29^2%3c%3d1.96^2*p*%281-p%29*n+where+n%3d322+solve+for+p+ ) [ at least 52 % have more contact to non-muslim people than muslim people in their free time ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28.6*n-p*n%29^2%3c%3d1.96^2*p*%281-p%29*n+where+n%3d322+solve+for+p+ ) [ at most 18 % have a purely muslim network of people with whom they interact in their free time ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28.08*n-p*n%29^2%3c%3d1.96^2*p*%281-p%29*n+where+n%3d322+solve+for+p+ ) good enough for you ? 
  every german who went to gymnasium knows this and now i never want to see a goddamn complaint about sample size on reddit ever again , before people have done these calculations . 
  the fuck are you talking about ? 
  first of all that has literally nothing to do with the comment you replied to and also , who the fuck is defending islamic extremists on here ? 
  can someone who upvoted you tell me why they think this is relevant to the discussion ? 
  \u00c6 and \u00d8 are just unnecessarily complicated \u00c4s and \u00d6s though . 
  what the actual fuck , even / r/european or / r/theredpill is nothing against that shithole . 
  some of the top posts are so delusional i want to send them medical help .
