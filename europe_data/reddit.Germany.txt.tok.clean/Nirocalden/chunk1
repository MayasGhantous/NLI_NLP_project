or realistic ? 
  both west and east germany claimed to be the only legitimate german state , which basically meant that even though they were always just a couple steps away from a war , they could n't officially talk to each other , let alone try to send diplomatic missions for some peace treaties . 
  and not just to each other - west germany was n't recognised by the whole eastern bloc and the gdr was n't acknowledged by all nato states . 
  so since that all did n't work too well in their opinion , instead they said `` we still do n't think you 're the legitimate legal successor of germany , but we acknowledge that you 've built a state over there ... let 's talk '' and that strategy led to the [ moscow treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_moscow_ ( 1970 \\ ) ) , the [ warsaw treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_warsaw_ ( 1970 \\ ) ) , and the [ basic treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_treaty,_1972 ) . 
  which also meant that both german states could finally join the united nations . 
  he was 17 when the war began , got conscripted as a soldier after finishing school in 1942 and got kicked out of the army in 1944 , after it was discovered that his grandmother was jewish ( so he was n't `` fully arian '' ) . 
  in that sense practically all german males of his age group were `` nazi soldiers '' , the only alternative for him would have been to flee the country or go to prison / kz . 
  as for him being a supporter of putin , you have to remember that he 's one of the brains behind the german [ ostpolitik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostpolitik ) with its main theme being `` change through rapprochement '' . 
  when he suggested that the west [ should respect ( not accept ) the annexation of crimea ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/2014-11/egon-bahr-krim-annexion-russland ) , he did n't say it because he was a fan of putin ( he also said '' [ even his children and grandchildren wo n't become democrats ] ( http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik/-egon-bahr--ich-war-beeindruckt--,10808018,29151818.html ) '' ) , but because he saw it as a chance to get russia to the table for diplomatic talks . 
  because that actually worked for them in the '70s . 
  sorry for the german sources . 
  the [ big eagle in the german parliament ] ( http://www.joergle44.de/p1010257b.jpg ) is literally ( well , colloquially ) called * fat hen * , 
  that 's certainly indisputable , but the austro-prussian war does n't seem to be biggest reason for that . 
   also note that in the war of 1866 bavaria fought on the side of austria against the prussians well , so did saxony , wurtemberg , and hanover ( all three were kingdoms too ) , also baden and both hesses and a bunch of smaller states ... 
  sport1 actually had live coverage every day . 
  i think haiti had their revolution while the napoleonic wars were fought in europe , but it 's the only example that immediately comes to mind . 
  there were [ seven series in total ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/once_upon_a_time ... ) , the newest is from 2008 !, 
  it 's per year . 
  and according to [ their site ] ( http://www.etoncollege.com/currentfees.aspx ) , the fees of eton college are # 34,434 or $ 47,270 per year . 
  a modern john cage interpretation !, 
  how about handel ? 
  born in germany , but he was pretty much a brit , was n't he ? 
  [ they paved paradise , put up a parking lot ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94bdmscdw20 ), 
  was n't your `` it 's so cute '' comment directed at the europe - brazil comparison ? 
  japan is just a bit larger than germany , but has a population of 125 million ( more than 1.5 times of germany 's pop . ), 
  well , denmark * is * the home of [ dogme 95 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogme_95 ), 
  sadly , [ reuters says ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/31/us-egypt-crash-iduskcn0sp06v20151031 ) it is . 
  this [ news article ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article12458240/die-besten-deutschen-schueler-stammen-aus-vietnam.html ) ( german ) mentions that 59 % of all vietnamese children visit the [ gymnasium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gymnasium_ ( germany \\ ) ) , the highest of three tiers of secondary schools . 
  this compares to 43 % of german children and it 's `` five times as high '' as children from italian or turkish families . 
  the article implies that the main reason for this is the high pressure in the families for the kids to perform well in school . 
  where would brussels end up ? 
   not saying if it is right or wrong you ca n't decide whether attacking someone , stabbing them with a knife multiple times and also injuring four other people is * right or wrong * ? 
  wtf ? 
  is it actually still called `` queen louise bridge '' in lithuanian and/or russian ? 
  you would think that they 'd changed the name after the war . 
  i do n't think that was their main point when writing that line , but in principle you 're not wrong , 
  according to a popular song , the bild consists of `` fear , hate , tits , and the weather report '', 
  here are the most common street names : 1 . 
  dorfstra\u00dfe 3.557 ( village ) 6 . 
  bergstra\u00dfe 3.544 ( mountain ) 7 . 
  birkenweg 2.808 ( birch road ) 8 . 
  ringstra\u00dfe 2.326 ( ring , circle ) 12 . 
  wiesenweg 1.739 ( meadow * road * ) 17 . 
  ahornweg 1.631 ( maple ) and if that 's not enough , here is a [ full list of the 200 most common street names ] ( http://www.strassen-in-deutschland.de/die-haeufigsten-strassennamen-in-deutschland.html ), 
  prussia came later . 
  i think the most important influence was actually luther , who translated the bible into high german ( specifically a formal saxon dialect ) and so set a first `` standard '' language , with a book that everyone wanted to be able to read . 
  chumbawamba [ wrote a nice song about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifq7dtujonc )  out from the shadows we took to the streets david chopping at the giant 's feet, 
  in short , in the state parliament of saxony-anhalt , there was a debate about whether the countries in the maghreb should be declared `` safe '' ( so that refugees from these countries would n't be able to get asylum ) , seeing as homosexuals in these countries are facing criminal charges and prison . 
  and at that point an afd member of the parliament called out `` we should do that here in germany as well ! '', 
  do you know if he / the government can dissolve the parliament now ? 
  or introduce new laws without the parliament ? 
  can he easily ban political parties ? 
  what exactly does this mean in detail ? 
  i 'm guessing ( much ) more executive power for him as the president ? 
  yes , it does . 
  and in italian , the country * germany * is `` germania '' , but the adjective * german * is `` tedesco '' from the same root . 
   this would leave out a new arrival who merely knows/believes/repeats what was taught back in his original country but would include an sa-like street force being told , in meetings , that the holocaust did n't happen . 
  yes , it 's probably meant along those lines . 
  according to wikipedia , `` public peace '' ( [ \u00f6ffentlicher friede ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%96ffentlicher_friede ) ) is simply described as the `` by the legal system guaranteed state of people being able to live together without any fear , and the trust that this state will continue to exist '' . 
  ianal , but i.e. 
  if a homeless person makes a loud , drunk hate speech on a park bench , then it 's * public * , but nobody has to be afraid that such an incitement will lead to political or social changes , even on the smallest scale ( like other people believing him and following his example ) . 
  so that 's probably just disturbance of the peace , not incitement to hatred . 
  if on the other hand the same speech would be done at a political demonstration , then that would be different . 
   do the germans not prosecute me-origin people in de who say what 's banned there ? 
  it does n't make sense for the law to only apply to ethnic germans . 
  the criminal code obviously applies to everybody in germany , no matter the nationality . 
  the important part here is , that the simple * mentioning * of the denial is probably not going to be persecuted , but instead only if it 's `` disturbing the public peace '' . 
   ** [ section 130 ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1241 ) ** ** incitement to hatred **  ( 3 ) whosoever ** publicly or in a meeting ** approves of , denies or downplays an act committed under the rule of national socialism of the kind indicated in section 6 ( 1 ) of the code of international criminal law , ** in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace ** shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine . 
  is there any reason why they used subcategories for ( south - , west - , east ) slavic languages , but did n't do the same for ( north - , west - ) germanic languages ? 
  not only that , but lead singer [ bruce dickinson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bruce_dickinson ) is their pilot !, 
   while of course i 'm not denying what had happened to armenians , and even feel more sad about assyrians and the assyrian genocide , this seems like a totally political move . 
  the text of the resolution actually does mention the `` members of other christian ethnic groups , particularly the aramaic/assyrian and chaldaean christians '' who were `` victims of deportations and massacres '' . 
  ( [ german source ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-armenien-resolution-im-wortlaut-a-1095397.html ) ) but yeah , for some reason it was n't deemed necessary to include them closer to the headline . 
  fun fact for non-natives : `` die geister , die ich rief ... '' ( `` the spirits i summoned ... '' ) is the german title of the bill murray christmas classic [ scrooged ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scrooged ) . 
  just one of many examples where a goethe quote is used as an idiom in the german language . 
  probably more `` misleading '' than incorrect , because the data across the different countries ( and regions , looking at the mecklenburg-brandenburg border in germany ) might be inconsistent . 
  in one example a several neighbouring villages with a population in the hundreds each might be independent entities ( < 1000 ) , while in another they might be just a part of a larger municipality (  1000 ) , which for the purpose of this map counts as `` town '' . 
   you ever saw that asshole ? 
  look in the mirror . 
  that 's volker pispers , right ? 
  got to love that guy :d, 
   but honestly if you go to a racing track and try out high speed driving without having a clue how you will also just wreck your car . 
  sure , but you do n't risk other people like that - that was my original point , 
  i do n't disagree , but you have to admit that it makes a difference whether you made your driver 's license in germany ( which includes training on the autobahn ) and are comfortable at such speeds ; or if you 're from a country where the nation wide max speed is 90 or 100 km/h and you 're like `` i heard there 's no speed limit in germany , i wan na go there , rent a porsche and play fast and furious ! '', 
  i 'm not saying that such drivers are an automatic risk to public safety . 
  i 'm just saying , if you want to try out high speed driving please go to an official race track where they offer stuff like that and get it out of your system . 
  i did n't mean that you * ca n't * , i meant that you * should n't * . 
  i do n't want some guy who wants to be a `` mach gogogo fast speed racer # 1 '' ( who maybe never drove at such speeds and has no idea what he 's doing ) anywhere near myself , when i 'm just trying to commute : / yes , the autobahn has no set speed limit at times , but it 's still not a race track . 
  if you want to drive recklessly fast , please do n't use the autobahn , where you possibly risk getting into accidents with other vehicles . 
  instead take a drive around the [ n\u00fcrburgring ] ( https://www.greenhelldriving.nuerburgring.de/#/landing ) or something . 
   the seven red seeblatts ( or pompebl\u00eaden , as they are called in frisian ) are a reference to the frisian `` sea countries '' in the middle ages : [ 1 ] independent regions along the coast from alkmaar to the weser who were allied against the vikings . 
   there were never precisely seven distinct regions , but the number seven probably has the connotation `` many . '', 
  some sources hold , however , that there have been seven frisian lands : west friesland , westergoa , eastergoa , hunsingo , fivelingo , emsingo , and jeverland . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_friesland '' [ seeblatt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seeblatt ) '' , german for `` sea leaf '' , is the vexicological and heraldic name for water lilies . 
  most franconians still do n't consider themselves to be `` actual '' bavarians , because their region only has been part of bavaria since 1803 . 
  i do n't know if `` gro\u00dfstadt '' is an official title , colloquially it 's just any * stadt * with more than 100,000 inhabitants . 
  that 's the spirit :d, 
   but sure , happy birthday in advance !, 
  fun fact : in germany that 's considered to be a sure source for bad luck . 
  it 's basically `` people who generally vote for party xyz '' , self-described of course .
