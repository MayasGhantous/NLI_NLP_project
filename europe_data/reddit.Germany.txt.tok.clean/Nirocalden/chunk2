  another advantage for schulz is that he 's not actually a part of the current government , that should make campaigning much easier for him than it would be for gabriel . 
  man , thanks for reminding me , i have to watch that film again some time soon !, 
  it has a [ great soundtrack ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3mfufoulyi ) too, 
  but the issue here is , that we have been taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees before , because we do have laws for these kinds of situations in place . 
  [ article 16 of the basic law ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0092 ) regards the right of asylum . 
  and here 's an [ article from the library of congress ] ( https://www.loc.gov/law/help/refugee-law/germany.php ) that goes into deeper details . 
   at least donald protects the americans against muslim refugees . 
  i have some [ anti-tiger rocks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm2w0sq9ddu ) for sale , if you 're interested . 
  i do n't know if you are being sarcastic , but the answer is yes . 
  germany did indeed [ take in hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers ] ( https://www.proasyl.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/asylantragszahlen-seit-1990-imke-2-660x440.png ) in the last decades . 
  [ eltz castle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/wierschem%2c_burg_eltz%2c_2012-08_cn-01.jpg ) , build by the same family , is actually one of the most famous genuine medieval castles in germany . 
  are these like theme parks , or are there actually people living there ? 
  * should have, 
  [ romani ite domum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbi-fdzujxi ) , is n't it ? 
  i guess one of the `` positive '' aspects ( i guess ? 
  maybe ? ), 
  of the two-party system is , that extremist parties and candidates * also * have a hard time being elected . 
  unless they , you know , manage to infiltrate one of the two parties . 
   the greens are on life support and have nothing left to fight for really . 
  that 's an interesting point . 
  there 's no more nuclear energy , people are separating their trash like it 's a religion , and now we 've got the `` marriage for everyone '' as well . 
  what * are * the greens ' `` hot topics '' they 're fighting for now ? 
  would they want to do that though ? 
  the governors , state assemblies etc are all either dem or rep too . 
   it resulted in the suicides of the highest tiers of the german government since you explicitly mention suicides , i just wanted to add that it was n't just the top tiers of the government , but also countless low tiers of local and municipal politicians , officers , down to thousands of `` normal '' people ( thinking of cases like the [ mass suicide in demmin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_suicide_in_demmin ) ) , caused by a mixture of years of continued nazi-propagated fear of the red army or `` the russian '' in general , and actual ( fear of ) retributions against the populace ( looting , killing , mass rape , etc ) . 
  does anyone know how many members the western orthodox ( celtic , french and gaul ) churches have ? 
  also * apologise * defence * offence, 
   what a point of this `` news '' ... ? 
  it 's literally in the first paragraph :  hundreds of special german police officers executed raids across several buildings across southern berlin early wednesday , nabbing four suspects, 
   police said an insider may have helped identify the coin i guess you 'd have to be an expert to recognise the _ correct _ 100 kg , manhole-size , pure gold coin ? 
  if you think about it , at its core political comedy and satire is about making fun of the people in power . 
  and that 's just something that , in general , conservative people are less comfortable with , because conservatism means stability , not revolution . 
  i do n't know if it 's `` people '' in general ( it could very well be ) , but most importantly it 's * families with children * who now move to or stay in big cities . 
  in previous decades it was usually the other way around : young people move to the city , but as soon as they started a family and got children they moved out to a suburb . 
  [ say what ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/suicides-europe.jpg ) ? 
  seems russia has more than double the suicide rates of germany ? 
  well the terminology was different , which while mostly symbolic is still understandably an important aspect for the affected people . 
  a `` registered civil partnership '' is not a `` marriage '' ; the two people are not `` married '' but `` partnered '' ( which sounds just as awkward in german as it does in english ) , and they 're each other 's `` civil partner '' , not their `` husband '' or `` wife '' . 
  another aspect is a constitutional one , because according to the basic law , `` marriage enjoys the special protection of the state '' , which obviously is n't the case for a `` registered partnership '', 
   and for us , __ the turks and turks __ are part of our society , '' said the spd politician . 
  i think the google translate algorithms still have room to improve :d, 
  at first i was quite confused by the house in the distance and the mountain , because i read the title as * muskau * ( in saxony ) , which is very famous for [ its parks and landscapes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muskau_park ) . 
  coats of arms are fine , but not on a flag . 
  flags are meant to be seen and recognised from several hundred meters away while flying in a breeze . 
  you ca n't read any writing like that . 
  see the famous [ ted talk by roman mars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5ikb2hl4 ) . 
  i do n't know if you realise this , but that 's actually really the reason for it . 
  having a coat of arms on the flag is not ideal , but okay-ish . 
  but having * writing * of any form on it , is a big no-no . 
  i hope you replied to them that it has to be `` cares '' , since it 's 3rd person singular . 
  let me look it up in wikipedia for you : [ akrotiri and dhekelia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akrotiri_and_dhekelia ), 
  * hm kings and queens are ` majesties ' , princes and princesses are royal highnesses . 
   gets stored in isolated and well maintained places . 
  unless there are reports of leakages of these supposed isolated and well maintained places into the ground water . 
  people are slightly annoyed by wind farms near them , but they 've been going on the streets against nuclear power in general for 30 years . 
  they were n't the only ones of course , as is stated in the article , siemens and krupp also had factories nearby . 
  there are probably no large german companies older than 70 years who did n't benefit from the nazis through slave labour or other things . 
  * [ summertime ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoiffg7sete ) and the livin ' is easy ... *, 
   a military where pregnant women are fighting do n't you think that women * might * get non-combat assignments during a pregnancy ? 
  and please note that the article is n't about `` pregnant women now have to work/fight '' , but instead `` pregnant women now do n't have to wear civilian clothing during work '' . 
   hansen = son of hans since you mentioned the english equivalents for the other names : hans -  johannes / johan -  john, 
   specifically in this case , the reporter does not give the reader the context in which the interviewee is wrong . 
  i mean , claiming that the eu does n't have any benefit for the * economy * of all things is n't really something most readers would feel the need to be convinced to be obviously wrong . 
  the question was n't about architects _ from _ your country , just ones that are well known _ in _ your country , 
  historically , [ karl friedrich schinkel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_friedrich_schinkel ) is pretty well known for designing many of the `` classic prussian '' buildings and palaces in an around berlin . 
  then there 's [ friedensreich hundertwasser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedensreich_hundertwasser ) , because when you see one of his buildings you immediately know who the architect was . 
  that 's a caricature though , a character performed by a comedian . 
  i do n't think that 's what the op meant . 
  i mean , it 's not too far away for us - there 's just one country between e.g. 
  norway and north korea . 
  fun fact : the [ german relative ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv9ykrcweey ) they 're visiting is [ willy millowitsch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willy_millowitsch ) , a very popular stage actor ( an actual * legend * in his native cologne ) . 
  i actually did look it up : ignoring a red light as a pedestrian can get you a fine of 5 $ . 
  if this behaviour causes an accident it 's 10 $ . 
  so the amount is n't really that large , the main reason to do the right thing is indeed social pressure . 
  it 's just not something you * do * . 
  and you can at least expect some dirty looks , especially if there are small children nearby . 
   t\u00fcbingen is in the east though east of baden ? 
  or what do you mean ? 
   i see a movie was made about that story this year . 
  i have n't seen it either , but you should be aware that [ into the fate ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5723272/ ) is * inspired * by , but not directly based on the nsu killings , so it 's not a dramatised retelling or documentary . 
  still , [ fatih akin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatih_akin ) is one of the best german directors , and diane kruger ( in her first ever german-language film btw ) won the best actress award in cannes , so it 's probably not awful , 
  or how about [ arno funke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arno_funke ) , nicknamed `` dagobert '' ( the german name of scrooge mcduck ) , who in the early '90s extorted money from large department stores with ( small ) planted bombs . 
   for six years , the extortionist [ ... ] baffled police and entertained the general public . 
  due to his careful precision and effort to eliminate any chance of anybody being hurt in his attacks , he was seen as a harmless prankster by many , and `` i am dagobert '' t-shirt sales were brisk at kiosks throughout the city . 
  and a quite famous historical criminal case is the [ schinderhannes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schinderhannes ) , johannes b\u00fcckler , a robber and thief active around 1800 . 
  in retrospect he was romanticised as some form of german robin hood , partly because the authorities he was evading and escaping from were the french occupying forces at that time , but in truth he was n't really a `` steal from the rich give it to the poor '' type of guy . 
  still there were apparently up to 40000 people spectating his eventual execution . 
  i think they mean slightly different things . 
  `` geselligkeit '' is more about having a good time with other people , while i associate `` gem\u00fctlichkeit '' more with a quiet , cosy atmosphere . 
  could you give an example sentence ? 
  also gardening is a hugely popular hobby , along with a general diy attitude . 
  people take pride in doing everything themselves . 
   in germany , you can drink `` light '' beverages ( beer , mostly ) once you are 16 it 's even at 14 , if you 're with your parents . 
  which basically means `` it 'll fail anyway !, 
  i think they mean in the upcoming elections , not in general . 
  let me tell you about the [ flammkuchen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tarte_flamb%c3%a9e ) , a traditional dish from the german-french border regions . 
  kind of similar to a pizza , but more savoury : with onions , cheese and bacon , and indeed adding sauerkraut is n't the most unusual choice either . 
  * if * germans have a more generous view of the us than other countries ( which i would n't accept as a proven fact just like that ) , then it 's probably mostly because of our post-ww2 relations , starting with the marshall plan and the berlin airlift . 
  we , as most europeans , do n't really think or care about ancestries . 
   the story behind is `` too lazy to remember new names '' it 's probably more a sense of staying connected to your old home and nostalgia , as opposed to `` i 've lived in * villingen-schwenningen * my whole life , and i refuse to remember a new name , just because i moved a continent away ! '',
