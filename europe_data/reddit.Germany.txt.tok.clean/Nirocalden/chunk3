   but to answer the question itself , a german newspaper actually [ made a map ] ( http://images.zeit.de/lebensart/2013-02/d-karte-08/d-karte-08-thickbox.jpg ) about this . 
  seems there are 40 `` hanover '' , 39 `` berlin '' , 30 `` hamburg '' and 25 `` frankfort '' spread across the usa . 
  ( not counting `` new xyz '' ), 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok_m9zsg5le if you want to be a pirate , you must have a beard . 
  hey , we 've got [ that song in german ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60mouhgtl0 ) too , 
  there are obviously * many * more or less iconic songs about berlin * the show tune [ berliner luft ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peiefbljay4 ) ( `` the air of berlin '' ) is an unofficial anthem , e.g. 
  traditionally played as the last song of the philharmonic 's summer concerts * another well known classic is [ ich hab noch einen koffer in berlin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-eqqo__ks ) ( `` i 've still got a suitcase in berlin '' ) * of ideal 's [ berlin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyyzaovt3wa ) , if you like new wave , which gives a pretty interesting description of west-berlin in 1980, 
  interestingly enough , the sport associations with the most registered members are : 1 . 
  dfb ( football ) : 6.9 million members 2 . 
  dsb ( shooting ) : 1.3 mio 5 . 
  dlv ( athletics ) : 0.8 mio, 
  there are apparently ca . 
  10000 [ reichsb\u00fcrger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsb%c3%bcrgerbewegung ) , who claim that the federal republic is illegal and that the german reich still exist ... does that count ? 
   within the state churches , there are still different directions , mainly lutheran and reformed reformed are calvinists btw , there are also a lot of [ `` united '' regional churches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evangelical_church_in_germany#member_churches_.28since_2012.29 ) , which is a mixture of both . 
   license to hunt it 's maybe worth mentioning that this is n't some random license you can simply get by paying a small fee . 
  instead you have to do an actual course with theoretical ( 60 hours ) and practical ( 60 hours ) parts , which is to be completed by an officially sanctioned exam also in both categories . 
   sorry i could n't think of a good title for this . 
  `` do parents address their kids as ( something like ) ` ya mama ' or ` ya baba ' in your country ? '', 
   average damages are 1m $ per year . 
  is that average per fire or per year in total ? 
  i agree . 
  for the most part she 's seen as a hollywood actress with close german ties , maybe like sandra bullock or kirsten dunst . 
  the reasoning is basically that tv is more of a passive medium , something they can have running in the background without having to pay too much attention to . 
  with on-demand services they always have to actively decide what to watch , which builds a kind of compulsion to also actively pay attention to it . 
  these consumers are just a minority ; two thirds of the 18-24 year olds only barely watch any linear television at all . 
  yeah , that seems to be the same source for the german word as well . 
  that 's interesting , most other languages that use indigo have it between blue and violet , i.e. 
  a darker shade . 
   pomara\u0144czowy , pomara\u0144cz - orange excuse the possible stupid question , but does the name come from the [ bitter orange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bitter_orange ) ? 
  because that one 's called `` pomeranze '' in german , 
  it happens from time to time that someone from a state parliament or - government gets brought to berlin . 
  the current minister for education , [ johanna wanka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johanna_wanka ) , used to be minister of science in lower saxony until her predecessor annette schavan quit the job ( because of the phd thing ) . 
  or [ manuela schwesig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuela_schwesig ) , who was minister for health in mv , but still became ( federal ) minister for family affairs without being elected into the bundestag . 
  so yes , it 's definitely more the exception than the norm , but - for ministers - it 's not completely unheard of . 
  now , i do n't think there 's ever been a * chancellor * who was n't part of the bundestag though . 
  yes , frederick the great was famous for [ vehemently introducing the potato ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_the_great#environment_and_agriculture ) in prussia . 
   also the story of having potato fields guarded by soldiers and deliberately letting peasants steal them at night to improve their image seems to be pop up again and again . 
  right , i always heard that as an anecdote about * old fritz * . 
  even today people are still [ putting potatoes on his grave ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/friedrich_ii_tomb_p7140136.jpg ) . 
  is n't there a popular alternative history novel with exactly that premise ? 
  * `` my ( rubber ) ducky wo n't share the water with you ! '' ... 
  yeah , it really sounds better in german . 
  yes , i know he speaks german fluently . 
  i just meant that he 's never really been in a german production ( i think ) , so most germans would n't immediately think of him as a german actor ... just like with diane kruger . 
  fun fact : diane kruger just made her very first german-language film ever ( [ in the fade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_the_fade ) by fatih akin ) , so most people probably do n't immediately think of her as a german actress . 
  same with michael fassbender , i do n't think he ever did one either ( ? ), 
  well ... let 's say he 's an actor with a couple good roles  knockin ' on heaven 's door is certainly a great film , but he 's also made lots of mediocre and downright garbage stuff . 
   i 've watched crash course world history . 
  is n't that enough ? 
  / s not really , but if you 've * also * watched bill wurtz 's [ history of the entire world , i guess ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xucn8ux2gbs ) , * then * you should know everything interesting that ever happened . 
  hmm , how strange now it wants me to pay too ? 
  it used to work when i made my original post ... edit : oh wait , try to open it in an incognito tab for some reason that works for me . 
  edit2 : nope , does n't seem to work anymore either ... how strange . 
  anyway , the [ french af federation ] ( http://www.fffa.org/fr/fffa/presentation/histoire-de-la-fffa.html ) has 23k members , so that 's less ( even with population ) , but then again , your football federation also has `` only '' 2 million members - compared to the 7 million in germany ( germans love to be in clubs ) . 
  so in the end it might be more popular , but not by a large margin . 
  i mean you would really have to go out of your way to get news about current games on tv , radio , newspapers , etc. 
  normal news programs probably mention the super bowl when it happens , but not much more . 
  is it more popular ? 
  keep in mind that germany has 82 million people , and we * love * to be part of a club ( or several ) . 
  look at the list in the link and see just how many sports are more popular than it . 
  according to [ this statistic ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/172539/umfrage/die-50-mitgliedstaerksten-sportverbaende/ ) , the german american football association has ~ 55000 members . 
  as comparison : baseball/softball 23k , ice hockey 25k , basketball 195k , volleyball 430k , handball 750k , and of course football 6.9 million . 
  `` high german '' dialects are both central german ( colognian , hessian , saxon , etc ) and * upper german * ( swabian , bavarian ( which includes austrian btw ) , etc. ), 
   that 's really interesting to have the religious divide based on location that 's because of [ * cuius regio , eius religio * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuius_regio,_eius_religio ) or `` whose realm , his religion '' . 
  i do n't know how much you know about german history , but during the holy roman empire , while the * kaiser * was technically the highest authority , he did n't actually have * that * much to say about what the individual princes and dukes in their own domains did . 
  after martin luther started the reformation , some of those quickly converted to protestantism , which did n't please the ( very catholic ) habsburg kaiser at all . 
  after a period of some very bloody wars [ a truce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_augsburg ) was agreed upon in 1555 , officially allowing each prince to choose their religion freely , while simultaneously stipulating that all of their subjects also converting to that religion . 
  ( so that there were no/less religious conflicts in each single state ) of course that did n't solve all problems and a few decades later the devastating [ thirty years war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war ) started in 1618 , with religion playing a large role in it . 
  but on the plus side , after the war ended protestants and catholics were able to live pretty peacefully as neighbours . 
   it also is interesting that the east is so athiest , because is n't that where merkel is from ? 
  and she is in the christian democratic union :p right , she 's the daughter of a lutheran pastor , certainly quite the exception in the gdr . 
  wei\u00dfwurst literally means `` white sausage '' , it 's made out of veal or pork , heated in water ( ie not grilled like the bratwurst ) . 
  it 's * only * eaten in munich/southern bavaria , as a sort-of brunch or pre-lunch snack . 
  i think so too . 
  and fun fact : practically the same thing happened with the construction of the * sydney opera house * as well . 
  it was originally thought to be completed in 1963 for a cost of 7 million australian dollars , but it was actually only completed in 1970 with a cost of 102 ( ! ), 
  million . 
  and nowadays nobody cares about that anymore ... 
  the new [ elbphilharmonie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elbphilharmonie ) in hamburg, 
   the white ribbon ( i am just going to pretend that the latter is entirely austrian ) other than that it 's set in , you know , deepest piefke-country : a small village in rural prussia . 
  but it 's definitely a great movie , 
  i was actually just checking the german wikipedia entry , and would n't you know , the brothers grimm already made a mention of this rhyme !, 
  you house is burning , the children are screaming !, 
  not for the ladybug , but there 's a well known children 's song for the maybug :  * maik\u00e4fer flieg !, 
  * * maybug fly !, 
  father is in the war mother is in [ pomerania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomerania ) pomerania has burned down maybug fly !, 
  * it probably references either the 30 years ' war ( 1618-1648 ) or the [ pomeranian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomeranian_war ) as part of the seven years ' war ( 1756-1763 ) , which were both pretty devastating for the region . 
  this thread is about a good thing from your country that others do n't have , the other one is the other way around - a good thing that all other countries have , but yours does n't . 
  that 's basically german too !, 
  * ( `` meerwasser '' and `` meer '' would be more common , but it 's still clearly understood ), 
  it 's absolutely no problem to see the alps [ from munich ] ( https://gooddaytolive.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/muenchen-1.jpg ), 
  shoutout to / r/askhistorians , maybe the best sub in all of reddit . 
  obviously you have to * l\u00fcft * as * sto\u00df * !, 
  he was the captain of the 1954 world champion squad , and you have to see how * incredibly * important that championship was - much more so than the others that followed . 
  that win was basically the first positive international news about germany after the end of the war , the first time the people felt they could be proud of their country again . 
  yes , originally both meant `` present '' , `` boon '' , `` offering '' and are related to the verb `` to give '' ( `` gabe '' and `` geben '' in german ) . 
  but apparently from pretty early on the word was also used sarcastically , or as a euphemism for a `` death-bringing gift '' , and over the centuries that meaning simply took over . 
   say u instead of o yeah , what i meant was that it depends on the language how you actually pronounce those . 
  the german short o is probably closer to the english u. 
  well , maybe .
