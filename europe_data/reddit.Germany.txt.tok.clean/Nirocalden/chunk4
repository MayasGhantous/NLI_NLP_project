  in german the yiddish word is known as `` schmock '' ( which is pronounced pretty much the same as the english version , i guess ) , and from a quick look at wikipedia , it seems that while the origin is n't known , it really does n't have anything to do with schmuck / jewellery . 
  new sweden seems to have been [ a bit south of present day new york ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/nieuw_nederland_and_nya_sverige.svg/412px-nieuw_nederland_and_nya_sverige.svg.png ) , but my comment was just a line from the song [ istanbul ( not constantinople ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sl4xcvmoxg ) anyway , 
  even old new york was once ` new amsterdam ' ... 
  can absolutely confirm this , thinking of `` digger '' as `` deutscher nigger '' is complete nonsense . 
  the [ german wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/dicker_ ( anrede \\ ) ) agrees as well , and even mentions that although the origin is ultimately unknown , it 's likely that it was already used as a greeting in the hamburg working class in the early 20th century . 
  i found a [ forsa survey ] ( http://www.dbb.de/fileadmin/pdfs/2014/forsa_2014.pdf ) ( pdf , p. 18 ) with practically the same results . 
  but it 's always a bit tricky , because the question was n't `` which profession do you respect most ? 
  '' , but `` how much do you respect profession x ? 
  ( out of a predetermined list ) '' so maybe financial analysts and marketing people are actually much more respected than firemen and nurses ... we 'll never know , because they did n't ask about them , 
   one of the great examples of this is the civil rights act . 
  everett mckinley dirksen , a republican , forged and helped pass this act under a democratic president that promoted it . 
  genuine question : when was the last time something like that happened though ? 
  from my impression it seems in the last two or three decades american politics have become * extremely * partisan . 
  juice in czech is called `` dzus '' ? 
  that 's so interesting !, 
  do you know if it has the same origin as the english word ? 
  i 'm not arguing that they did n't have certain privileges or various degrees of economic autonomy granted by their respective lords , but they were n't all official `` free '' or `` imperial '' cities , they did n't have imperial immediacy and they were n't directly represented at the imperial diets, 
   all hanseatic citys had to be free citys sorry , but that 's evidently not true . 
  rostock and wismar were subjects of the duchy of mecklenburg , stralsund , greifswald and stettin/szczecin belonged to the duchy of pomerania , l\u00fcneburg and braunschweig / brunswick to the duchy of brunswick-l\u00fcneburg . 
  and all of those were very prominent hanseatic cities . 
  this is probably a bit splitting of hairs , but hamburg and bremen are n't their own states historically because of the hanse , but because they 're ( or have been ) [ free cities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_imperial_city ) . 
  for example [ hamburg 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamburg ) official name is `` free and hanseatic city of hamburg '' . 
  most members of the hanse even during its high time have always been `` unfree '' in that sense . 
  that makes sense of course , but i was n't sure because the other one was a french colony . 
   congo which one though ? 
   fc bayern munich would be the munich assholes . 
  munich moneybags, 
  [ frankfurt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurt ) is sometimes called `` mainhattan '' , because it 's the only german city with such a distinct skyline , and because it 's such a centre of finance . 
  [ dresden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dresden ) is `` elbflorenz '' ( [ florence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/florence ) at the elbe river ) , but only when talking about its architecture , so i do n't know if that counts . 
  several cities in the north ( hamburg , bremen , l\u00fcbeck , rostock , ... ) have the official title of [ hansestadt / hanseatic city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanseatic_league ) [ lutherstadt wittenberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wittenberg ) put martin luther right into their official name . 
   it bombed spectacularly in germany ( what the shit , germany ? ), 
  that 's an interesting question , i 'm not sure really . 
  our domestic critics liked it well enough , same as anywhere else , but apparently the audience rating practically halved from the first to the last episode . 
  maybe it 's because the topic is n't anything groundbreakingly `` exotic '' , as there were and are * many * films and tv shows about german-german relations , cold war , stasi , nva , and general [ ostalgia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostalgie ) . 
   i ca n't remember what it was , but maybe it was the newsroom that had this thing that really bothered me . 
  a bit late , but the newsroom usually made references to real news ( not just real countries , but actual real news events ) . 
  but * the west wing * definitely had some fictional countries in africa and the middle east . 
  but then again , at one point the president ordered the assassination of a high ranking member of government from one of them , so maybe the show runners just did n't want to risk any potential hassle ? 
  i remember there once was a zdf show called '' [ kanzleramt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8jtmkrj-ny ) '' , which was supposed to be a german version of the west wing , but obviously it was n't * nearly * as good or as popular , so it was cancelled after one season . 
  the border between [ portugal and spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugal%e2%80%93spain_border ) is already one of the oldest borders in the world right now . 
  it 's been practically unchanged for 700 years , since 1297 . 
  well , there 's the [ volkstrauertag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkstrauertag ) ( `` people 's day of mourning '' ) , commemorating both soldiers and civilians who died in wars . 
  but yes that 's not really something many people `` celebrate '' or even think of - it does n't help that it 's always on a sunday too . 
  op is talking about the demonyms , i.e. 
  the name for the people living in the country . 
  so that would be * belg ( m ) , belgische ( f ) in dutch * belge ( m + f ) in french * belgier ( m ) , belgierin ( f ) in german ( right ? ), 
  do you have such a low opinion of your country that you believe your monarchy has to be the main reason tourists come for a visit ? 
  and in berlin and surrounding areas it 's called `` eierkuchen '' . 
  ( because `` pfannkuchen '' is there , what everyone else calls a '' [ berliner ] ( http://blog.willamette.edu/worldnews/files/2012/02/berliner-pfannkuchen-fotolia_460.jpg ) '' ) :d, 
  in germany we call it `` anstandsst\u00fcck '' = decency piece , or `` h\u00f6flichkeitsst\u00fcck '' = courtesy piece . 
  no need to be ashamed about it , it 's just considerate to * not * take it until the host explicitly offers it to someone . 
   samstag = saturn 's day/sabbat ( jewish day of rest ) saturday also has an alternative name : * sonnabend * = sun evening probably from when the `` evening '' came before the `` day '' , like in christmas eve or halloween = all hallows evening, 
  how interesting !, 
  do you know if the sunday was always still considered the first day of the week ( before the industrialisation with a clear-cut `` work week '' and the two-day weekend even later still ) ? 
  this might go into off-topic territory here , but do you know why christians decided to have their day of rest on sunday then ? 
  at least from the 1960s on , british music is without a doubt the best in the world . 
  beatles , stones , the who , the kinks , pink floyd , led zeppelin , queen , david bowie , the clash , sex pistols , black sabbath , mot\u00f6rhead , iron maiden , madness , the smiths , the cure , stone roses , blur , oasis , radiohead , muse , and i 'm probably missing a dozen extremely obvious other examples . 
  fun fact : those ads are all spoken by the boss / founder of seitenbacher himself ( i think he even does them in his own home studio too ), 
  even acknowledging that , it 's a bit of a stretch to go from `` pretty popular quick lunch for kids '' to `` ketchup is ** the main thing ** to put on pasta '' ( and i 'm not even touching that making a basic tomato sauce literally takes the same time as cooking the pasta itself - and it 's almost as easy too  ), 
  ... if you ca n't ( or do n't want to ) cook ? 
  qwertz is the german layout . 
  same in germany . 
  it 's called [ untouchable ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/ ) ( `` intouchable '' in the original ) really good film , 
  also [ erdnussflips ] ( https://erdnuesse.eu/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/erdnussflips.jpg ) - i think those are n't really known in the anglosphere ? 
  the \u00df is used after a long vowel or a diphtong ( `` ei '' , `` au '' , etc ) , ` ss ' is used after short vowels . 
  * die ma\u00dfe [ ma\u02d0s\u0259 ] - measurements ( pl ) * die masse [ \u02c8mas\u0259 ] - mass , weight * besser [ \u02c8b\u025bs\u0250 ] - better * bei\u00dfen [ \u02c8ba\u026a\u032fsn\u0329 ] - to bite -------- when you learned german before the spelling reform you probably learned words like `` da\u00df '' ( that ) , `` fa\u00df '' ( barrel ) , or `` na\u00df '' ( wet ) . 
  since they 're all pronounced with a short vowel these words all written with ` ss ' nowadays . 
  when trier is already mentioned , there 's also the famous [ porta nigra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porta_nigra ) ( `` black gate '' ) , built 186-200 ad . 
  or how about [ tinariwen - cler achel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrroavu4ady ), 
  it literally strikes out the cent part of the price : `` twenty euros and nothing '' -  `` 20 , - $ '' so it really would n't make any sense to put it in after a cent amount . 
   the first controlled flight was by some german i forget the name of in berlin i believe . 
  [ otto lilienthal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_lilienthal ) `` was the first person to make well-documented , repeated , successful flights with unpowered airplanes . '', 
   would hansel and gretel be examples ? 
   h\u00e4nsel is probably some version of hans and gretel of gretchen , but i honestly do n't know . 
  yes , that 's right . 
  and * grete / gretel / gretchen * is of course a diminutive of * margarete * , just like hans is one of johannes . 
  but one should keep in mind that the grimm brothers found the majority of their fairy tales in northern and middle hesse , so that 's a bit of a distance to switzerland . 
   four wolve angles and a sword crossed with an axe . 
  for some reason i expected hops or a beer keg or something like that , 
  there are two main ways to do potato salad in germany ( of course everyone has their own special recipe ) : the proper way is done in the north with mayonnaise , but for some reason people in the south insist of doing it with vinegar and oil . 
  schafkopf ( `` sheep head '' ) is pretty regional , but there are also the related games of [ doppelkopf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doppelkopf ) ( `` double head '' ) and of course [ skat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skat_ ( card_game \\ ) ) ( with a long ` a ' , rhymes with `` part '' ) , which is arguably the most popular german traditional card game . 
  actually , lower saxony * is * the [ `` original '' saxony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_saxony ) , they only moved south a couple centuries later . 
  * frank sch\u00e4tzing - der schwarm ( [ the swarm ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68146.the_swarm ) ) an apocalyptic eco - / science-fiction thriller . 
  quite heavy on the science in some parts ( think ` the martian ' ) , but also suspenseful , action-packed and with lots of global catastrophes . 
  * sven regener - herr lehmann ( [ berlin blues ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4637.berlin_blues ) ) a character-driven view on the life of the nobody frank ( to his annoyance only called `` herr lehmann '' = `` mr. lehmann '' by his friends , since he 's almost 30 years old ) in west berlin in 1989 , shortly before the fall of the berlin wall . 
  i honestly do n't know if the humour translates well , but check it out if you 're interested in the very unique free-spirited fatalistic culture that was west berlin at that time . 
  * daniel kehlmann - die vermessung der welt ( [ measuring the world ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/642231.measuring_the_world ) ) a ( semi-fictional ) double biography of two of the greatest german scientists of the late 18th / early 19th century : naturalist [ alexander von humboldt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_von_humboldt ) and mathematician [ carl friedrich gauss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_friedrich_gauss ) . 
  both make it their mission in life to `` measure the world '' , but while the former travels across the globe , the latter almost never leaves his home town . 
  not even the far-right afd or the even further right npd go that far . 
  you use a progressive form ( also called `` continuous '' form ) when you 're describing an action that is currently underway , but not completed yet . 
  in english it is formed with a form of `` to be '' and the main verb with the ending * - ing * * i __ am writing __ a reply to your post . 
  ( i 'm currently doing it , and not yet finished ) in german there is no such aspect for verb forms outside of dialects . 
  that 's not really a problem though , because you can just use a qualifier like `` right now '' to the sentence . 
  so it 's not better or worse , just different . 
  same with other german comedies . 
  [ der schuh des manitu ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248408/ ) probably makes zero sense if you know neither bully herbig 's tv show nor the [ karl may ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_may ) westerns . 
  same with traumschiff surprise or the sissi cartoon . 
  or [ der wixxer ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313021/ ) , which is a spoof/homage of [ edgar wallace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_wallace ) crime films of the 1950s and 60s . 
  probably similarly to the audience in the film :d, 
   mls is n't the most serious sports league .
