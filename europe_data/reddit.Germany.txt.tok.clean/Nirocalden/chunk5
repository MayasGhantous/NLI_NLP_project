  i 'm sorry , but my knowledge of the us leagues is pretty limited . 
  is there a structural or conceptual difference between the mls and the others ? 
  or is it just because soccer is n't that popular that makes them `` less serious '' ? 
  and while they 're not named after a company , are n't most teams owned by billionaires or companies that expect or demand a profit ? 
  i mean the very fact that a whole team can be bought and moved to a different city is as capitalist as it gets ; is that that much of a difference in the end ? 
  as an american , should n't you be used to stuff like that ? 
  i mean the new york red bulls are a few years older than rb leipzig after all . 
  i agree , and even if the cdu would n't win - the most likely outcome in that case would probably still be a grand coalition ( like we have now ) , just with the spd as the larger partner and schulz as chancellor . 
   they 'll end up in parliament , which can either push them up further or , as has been the case with `` protest parties '' before , reduce them into oblivion after one election term . 
  __ that sort of thing gets more likely when parties keep having schisms and infighting over the true!ideology . __ i just wanted to emphasise that this is very much the case for the afd . 
  frauke petry can currently only hold her position in the party because she 's popular at the base of the party , the other board members would very happily get rid of her sooner rather than later ( just like they did with the former party leader bernd lucke in 2015 ) if they could . 
  it does n't have wimbledon in germany at least . 
  one of the most famous squares in berlin is of course the [ pariser platz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pariser_platz ) , with the brandenburg gate , the french and us embassies , and the famous hotel adlon . 
  the name is n't really a sign of friendship or admiration though , it was named after the allies ' victory over napoleon in 1814 . 
  i think i saw something like that on a mural in the townhall of pawnee , in . 
  once . 
   hurricane festival in scheessel ( mainstream music )  southside festival in neuhausen ( alternative music ) just like rock am ring / im park , the hurricane and southside are `` sister festivals '' in that they 're on the same weekend , with mostly the same line-up each year . 
   fat pigeon fat * hen * ( fette henne ), 
  northerner here who can confirm this to be a thing . 
  the explanation i always heard was , that in the past when sailors did n't have any actual work on a ship , which especially happened in winter , they often tried to earn some money with selling matches . 
  so if you 're lighting your cigarette from a candle and not a matchstick , you 're making them lose their last meagre income . 
  okay , just remember that it 's not `` as much salt as you can possibly move with two fingers '' , instead just put your thumb and forefinger into your salt pot , pinch them together and take them out again . 
  whether you got .5 or .05 g probably wo n't make much of a difference . 
   i also hate it when the recipe says `` a pinch of salt '' . 
  what 's a pinch ? 
  i can get different amounts between my fingers !, 
  would you rather actually measure out 1/4 g ? 
  maybe ask this over in / r/askhistorians for an actual objective answer . 
  is n't the fact that there is such a thing as a `` contested state '' in the first place a sign for an election system that is n't working so well ? 
  it basically means that voting in these 10 states is more important than in the 40 others . 
   i also blame the half of americans who could n't be bothered to vote . 
  tbf , if i were a supporter of the democrats living in alabama , or a republican supporter living in massachusetts i can kind of understand not going to vote . 
  it just does n't make a difference whether the result is 80-20 or 49-51 . 
  at least maine and nebraska have some kind of proportional system . 
  do n't forget [ an de eck steit 'n jung mit 'n trudelband ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj8tcj1cbsw ) ( sometimes it 's a t\u00fcdelband ), 
  probably more like properly trained soldiers with armour , weapons and horses against a bunch of farmers with clubs and pitchforks . 
  note that the nzz ( neue z\u00fcrcher zeitung ) is a swiss newspaper . 
  paavo nurmi , kimi r\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen , mika h\u00e4kkinen , janne ahonen are some sportsmen that immediately come to mind, 
  i know we do n't like to talk much about it , but let 's be real : the [ peasants ' war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_peasants%27_war ) was n't really our finest hour , to put it mildly . 
  the largest european revolt prior to the french revolution , brutally shut down by the aristocracy . 
  up to 100,000 men slaughtered by just a few thousand professional soldiers . 
  it 's a bit imperialistic , but it must be so satisfying to ~ ~ yell ~ ~ sing * land of hope and glory * in a football stadium with ten thousand others . 
  * rule britannia * on the other hand is probably too hard to sing though ? 
  apart from the chorus of course . 
   but we hardly every sing it besides world and european soccer cups . 
  so during four weeks every other year . 
  well , there are a dozen or so international matches even in years without euros or world cup , so you do have a chance to sing it more often - admittedly with less emotional involvement , i guess . 
  born and raised in poland , went to paris to study , married pierre and stayed there pretty much for the rest of her life , eventually also getting french citizenship . 
   while a french citizen , marie sk\u0142odowska curie ( she used both surnames ) [ 6 ] [ 7 ] never lost her sense of polish identity . 
  she taught her daughters the polish language and took them on visits to poland . 
  [ 8 ] she named the first chemical element that she discovered -- polonium , which she isolated in 1898 -- after her native country . 
  good to know . 
  flag burning ( german or otherwise ) is n't really a very common form of protest , i could n't remember if or when it happened the last time . 
  no , in germany that 's illegal . 
  [ section 90a of the criminal code ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0928 ) says :  __ defamation of the state and its symbols __  ( 2 ) whosoever removes , destroys , damages , renders unusable or defaces , or otherwise insults by mischief a publicly displayed flag of the federal republic of germany or one of its states or a national emblem installed by a public authority of the federal republic of germany or one of its states shall incur the same liability . 
  the attempt shall be punishable . 
   you 'll find some in saxony there are [ some in lower saxony ] ( https://www.nabu.de/downloads/fotos/wolf/nabu-wolfskarte-vorkommen-deutschland.jpg ) now as well , so they actually might migrate at least to east-westphalia / lippe before too long . 
  merci beaucoup !, 
  i will check those out , 
   favourite french song serge gainsbourg - le poin\u00e7onneur des lilas such a great song !, 
  icelandic : [ sigur r\u00f3s - hopp\u00edpolla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mztb8wxew78 ) french : [ georges brassens - les copains d'abord ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9oecwfjf3m ) so many great wordplays in this spanish : [ mano negra - mala vida ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwv2km1laic ) dutch : [ hermann van veen - laat me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qd7h4jqlw0 ) the original by rasmes shaffy is nice as well , but i really like this version flemish : [ flip kowlier - min moaten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ecxywmn9hs ) welsh : [ gorky 's zygotic mynci - iechyd da ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijeyoa_evko ) because it 's important to be able to say `` cheers ! '', 
  in as many languages as possible . 
  romani : [ emir kusturica - djinji rinji bubamara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3mfufoulyi ), 
  one of the few cases where the censored video is actually better than the original :d, 
  how about [ ravel 's bol\u00e9ro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzdiarzy0ak ) or jacques offenbach 's [ infernal gallop ( aka `` can-can '' ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4diu2n8tgka ) ? 
  for the people who do n't recognise that title : it 's the name of the 4th movement of ludwig van beethoven 's 9th symphony , and as a standalone piece mostly known as [ ode to joy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) , the european anthem . 
  that was maybe the case during the war and immediately afterwards , but certainly not during the whole occupation until the early 90s . 
   people look at it from very modern perspective and come to wrong conclusions . 
  i 'm not arguing one way or the other , but i 've actually heard this exact same argument used the other way around : `` during that period nation states were meaningless , just because he was born and lived in poland does n't mean that he was actually polish - he even spoke german as his first language , you see ! '', 
  de : [ schwedisches modell ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwedisches_modell ) so at least you 're not alone !, 
  yes , that 's how i see it as well . 
  no , he 's completely unknown in germany . 
  ( and i do n't find him particularly funny myself , but that 's just personal taste ), 
  `` h\u00e4ngematte '' ( hammock ) could be seen as a composite noun meaning `` hanging mat '' , but it actually comes from the [ ta\u00edno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ta%c3%adno ) `` ham\u00e1ka '' . 
  we actually had a `` nipplegate '' in germany too !, 
  it was in 1970 though , when a female contestant in a family gameshow decided to [ put on a completely transparent blouse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kndqa1_9-n0 ) ( nsfw , i guess ) as part of one of the games . 
  this actually caused quite a storm afterwards , according to wikipedia there were even death - and bomb threads , but afaik there was no serious talk about the ( state-owned ) channel implementing any measures of ( self ) censorship . 
  or if there were they did n't actually do it . 
  in the late 70s , when the comedy show klimbim showed some nudity it was still kind of talked about ( they were trying to be provocative ) , but by the late 80s and early 90s we had shows like [ tutti frutti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lflfh-aknoo ) ( nsfw , i guess ) and nobody batted an eye anymore . 
  that 's why we generally thought the notion that showing a nipple on tv in 2004 ( ! ), 
  to be a huge scandal was kind of ridiculous really . 
  when it 's used in the company of `` worst '' and `` most ridiculous '' , and without any clearly positive adjectives , then it does n't really have a positive connotation either , does it . 
  ah , so you just meant `` odd '' in the sense of `` unusual '' . 
  i think op 's question was going more for negative examples - at least that 's how i understood it . 
  could you elaborate on that ? 
  do you think this is the `` oddest '' , `` most ridiculous '' , or the `` worst '' part of the constitution ? 
  without being an expert on merkel , i think that 's a very accurate ( and quite in-depth ! ), 
  characterisation of her and german politics as a whole . 
  i do n't think most people really * like * to have a grand coalition , which combines 80 % of the parliament seats . 
  it 's not necessarily * bad * either , but it 's `` stable '' to the point of stifling . 
  there are barely any debates going on , because the opposition is so weak - and the polemic far-right-to-the-point-of-being-almost-neo-nazi afd outside of the parliament certainly is n't a gift to democracy either . 
  but in this situation merkel is probably the best chancellor ( or the other way around : for merkel to stay chancellor this is the perfect situation ) , i do n't know if she would fare as well with a slim 51-49 majority and a strong opposition leader just waiting for the chance to take her place . 
  i 'm not sure whether it 's state or municipal law , but the city is definitely responsible for getting rid of them when the party does n't do it . 
  but the parties * do * have to remove their campaign posters again . 
  i think they have one week after the election to do it , otherwise the city or municipality will do it for them and charge the party for the costs ( in [ this example in essen ] ( http://www.derwesten.de/staedte/essen/sued/vergessene-wahl-plakate-werden-teuer-id8523742.html ) it 's 45 $ per sign ) . 
  yes , i get what you mean . 
  but there are some nice state flags , i like [ bremen 's ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/flag_of_bremen.svg/600px-flag_of_bremen.svg.png ) , e.g. 
  which state do you mean ? 
  was n't there a movement once to introduce a [ version with a nordic cross ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/estonian_alternative_flag_proposal.svg/594px-estonian_alternative_flag_proposal.svg.png ) ? 
  for germany , instead of munich you should take a look at the [ middle rhine valley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle_rhine ) .
