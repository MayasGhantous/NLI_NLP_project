  you probably ca n't find a higher number of castles in such a small area anywhere else . 
  and it 's also a famous wine region as well . 
   `` the shirt is closer than the trousers '' ( about being selfish ) the saying is actually `` the shirt is closer than the jacket . '', 
  of course you could now say that it 's `` jacke wie hose '' , `` jacket like trousers '' , meaning that it does n't matter at all . 
  so basically like pawnee and eagleton :d, 
  [ `` ivan the terrible killing his son '' ( 1885 ) , by ilya repin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7ssbb.jpg ), 
  it 's all right , no worries , 
  yes , i did n't mean to imply that that 's the only problem . 
  i just wanted to give something for the people who are too lazy to read the whole article , 
  here 's [ an article that goes into the issue ] ( http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-dont-we-have-driverless-trains-yet ) tl ; dr  as with many things in life , the answer comes down to money . 
  `` the economic profit for sparing the driver is not that high if you have a train with 500 or 1000 passengers and one driver '', 
   `` hello world '' do n't you use `` hallo welt '' , like the french do ( and exactly opposite to the way germans use these ) ? 
   i doubt we would be willing to risk a nuclear confrontation over this but why would russia risk it ? 
  what is there to gain for them ? 
  crimea has a pretty important strategic position , including the largest ( i think ) russian naval base in the black sea , and has an important symbolic character ( crimea was russian for a long time until it was `` gifted '' to the ukrainian ssr during soviet times ) . 
  iirc the ethnic russian minorities in the baltic states are pretty much concentrated in the border regions . 
  russia already has an ice-free harbor in the baltic sea with kaliningrad . 
  so why would they risk a war with pretty much * all * of europe and the us just for a few km ^ 2 of strategic and symbolic unimportant land and a few tens of thousand of ethnic russians ( who may or may not rather stay in the eu anyway ? ), 
   they could do a `` crimea '' to annex the areas of russian speaking populations . 
  considering that all baltic states are in both the nato and the eu , i think that 's not really that likely to happen . 
  actually the `` wal '' in walk\u00fcre and walhalla does n't mean `` vote '' , but `` warrior that was slain on the battlefield '' ( old nordic `` valr '' ) . 
  the verb `` k\u00fcren '' also is n't so much `` giving '' , but * `` choosing '' * ( e.g. 
  who will be the winner of a competition ) so a valkyrie / walk\u00fcre literally chose who had to die in battle . 
  [ german source ] ( http://www.wissen.de/fremdwort/walkuere ) [ english source ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=valkyrie ),

  oscar wilde even wrote an [ educational play about this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_importance_of_being_earnest ) , did n't he . 
  in german we call this the `` anstandsst\u00fcck '' , the decency piece , because the decent thing to do is to leave it alone ( unless the host of the meal / party explicitly offers it to you ), 
  why do n't you do it ? 
  remember that obama basically got the nobel peace prize for being `` not bush '' , i ca n't imagine what the world 's reaction to trump 's successor will be . 
  maybe they 'll rename a city or country after them or something , 
  and i did n't even know that nsync was a scottish band !, 
  it 's `` bye bye baby '' by the bay city rollers , right ?

  this year , from the 31st at noon until early morning on the 1st , [ it gets shown 26 times ] ( http://www.fernsehserien.de/dinner-for-one/sendetermine ) ( ! ), 
  on different tv channels . 
  that 's what i thought as well !, 
  [ hocus pocus by focus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngavuapdvuy ), 
  generally i fully agree with you , but on the other hand it actually might be interesting to hear about a band or an artist that 's * really * popular in the uk - but * only * there , and in no other country . 
  whoops , thanks for that !, 
  tim minchin made a really nice song about this called [ white wine in the sun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcnvzqpa-7q ) ( he 's australian , so christmas is a summer holiday ) . 
  i 'd say for the absolute majority christmas is a * family * holiday first and foremost , not a religious one . 
  that 's `` englische creme '' in german too !, 
   cdu/csu : the christian democratic/socialist union . 
  christian __ social __ union , they 're certainly not socialist ... 
  and that 's the average !, 
  different regions were affected differently . 
  you could read up on the [ sack of magdeburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sack_of_magdeburg ) . 
  before the war it was one of the largest and most important cities , then it was sieged , conquered , looted and burned to the ground . 
  out of the more than 30,000 inhabitants only approximately 5,000 survived ( !, 
  ) , a few years later the city had a population of less than 500 . 
  where are you from ? 
  are you interested in culture / nightlife / nature / ... ? 
  begging usually is n't allowed , so the authorities want to prevent people from just getting a guitar out of the trash using it as an excuse to sit on the street without knowing how to play and still ask for money . 
  also this way they can control how many street performers are playing at any given time . 
  or how about having a christmas tree ? 
  * [ slime - sie wollen wieder schie\u00dfen ( d\u00fcrfen ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn6grub2l4y ) `` they want to ( be allowed to ) shoot again '' regarding the rising far-right , anti-refugee movement * [ ok kid - gute menschen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnp4w8etaxu ) `` good people '' , with a clear pun towards the polemic [ gutmensch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gutmensch ) , basically a song about hypocrisy * [ dota kehr - grenzen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgpoe_2dwhy ) `` borders '' , she basically advocates for nothing less than abolishing all international borders , because nothing good has ever come from them ; and for her to get a `` passport as ` citizen of earth ' '' . 
   dialect is more common in the `` dritte '' though ( br , hr etc ) . 
  just as an explanation : the `` dritte '' or `` thirds '' are the [ regional public broadcasters ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/ard_karte.svg/1000px-ard_karte.svg.png ) , which together comprise the [ ard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ard_ ( broadcaster \\ ) ) . 
  since they put their focus on * regional * news , stories , documentaries , etc it 's more common to hear dialects there . 
  as stated above that is certainly not the case for national channels . 
  nono , i just meant the very fact that it came so close that it 's basically 50/50 that 's already bad enough , and i do n't even want to imagine hofer actually winning . 
  nevertheless i hope the end results will basically be the same . 
  just take a look at the [ 2002 elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2002 ) with her father , jean-marie le pen . 
  in the first round he was second with 16.8 % , only slightly behind jacques chirac with 19.9 % . 
  but in the second round he could barely improve his numbers to 17.8 % , while chirac got an overwhelming 82.2 % . 
  basically , everybody who was ready to vote for him and fn already did so in the first round , while * everybody else * thought `` anyone but him '' . 
  i think it 's not unreasonable to assume that something similar will happen in this election as well . 
  ... or it will end like in austria : /, 
  the smallest german city is [ arnis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnis,_germany ) , both in population and area , with 279 inhabitants on 0.45 km ^ 2 ( same size as the vatican ) the largest village is [ ha\u00dfloch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ha%c3%9floch ) , with a bit over 20,000 inhabitants . 
  also france and the netherlands ( i guess it 's the kingdom ? ), 
  actually have a common land border - on the caribbean island of [ saint martin / sint maarten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_martin ), 
  * kehlen aus stahl would sound more natural , and it 's also closer to the `` kehlen von stahl '' direct translation , we just use a different preposition , 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.quick-german-recipes.com/cabbage-rolls-recipe.html ) . 
  it 's not really a complicated dish , but it 's a bit of work . 
   5 ) absentee ballots tbf , that 's already a thing in many parts of the us , just like early voting . 
  but that reminds me of another issue : how come a * national * election can have * regional * rules ? 
  should n't it be the case that someone voting in kansas has the exact same opportunities and rules to follow as someone voting in connecticut ? 
  ( also regarding photo ids , pre-registering , etc. ), 
   and i do n't speak a word of german do you speak * any * language besides english ? 
  i would n't assume that it 's possible to study without being pretty much fluent in the local language . 
  here 's a [ history of german rap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iksa41ly1m8 ) . 
  yes , english can be weird . 
  it can be understood through tough thorough thought , though . 
  here 's [ an illustration ] ( http://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/09/diagram-barcelona.gif ) of atlanta and barcelona to scale . 
  this sprawl can be pretty ridiculous . 
  oh well , i did n't read that ( obviously ) : / still a great song though , is n't it !, 
  and then there 's also schubert 's beautiful version of [ ave maria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bosoux_d8y ) , which despite the title is actually is n't actually a rendition of the `` hail mary '' prayer , but is based on a scene of sir walter scott 's [ the lady of the lake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_lady_of_the_lake_ ( poem \\ ) ) . 
  that 's why its official title is '' [ ellen 's third song ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ave_maria_ ( schubert \\ ) ) '' . 
   in scott 's poem the character ellen douglas , the lady of the lake ( loch katrine in the scottish highlands ) , has gone with her exiled father to stay in the goblin 's cave as he has declined to join their previous host , roderick dhu , in rebellion against king james . 
  roderick dhu , the chieftain of clan alpine , sets off up the mountain with his warriors , but lingers and hears the distant sound of the harpist allan-bane , accompanying ellen who sings a prayer addressed to the virgin mary , calling upon her for help . 
  roderick dhu pauses , then goes on to battle . 
  ah , of course , 
  it does n't exist anymore , but there was the [ trans europa express ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkhfswoalye ) ( which also inspired a great song and album by kraftwerk ), 
  what do they do ? 
  that 's how [ they often look here as well ] ( http://www.schornsteinfeger-berlin.de/sib-files/die-innung/plusschornsteinfeger-berlin.jpg ), 
  the overall organisation might be different , but we have `` deichgrafen '' in germany too . 
  ( at least at the north sea , there 's not much need for them at the baltic ), 
   salzberg i found pretty and interesting but quite small you probably mean salzburg , right ? 
  salzberg ( or more specifically `` obersalzberg '' ) is a small village where hitler 's mountain residence was . 
  ( burg = castle ; berg = mountain ),
