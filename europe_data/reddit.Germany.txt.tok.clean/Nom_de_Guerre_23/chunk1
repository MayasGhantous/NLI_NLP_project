except chocolate and beer . 
  seems fair to me . 
  time for another insightful german post !, 
  sorry for that arrogance . 
  most germans would never think of your `` beamtentum '' as a left issue , on the contrary : in the decades following '68 tenured servants with an obligation to take the oath to our constitutional system was the best insurance against communists and other radicals becoming teachers or the like ( see also : radikalenerlass , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berufsverbot#the_1972_anti-radical_decree ) . 
  it 's more the historic heritage of the prussian state and on the plus side it may lead to a few more competent people going into public sector and teaching ( `` well , it 's not as good paid as private but at least job security , less taxes and better pensions '' ) . 
  we are somehow quite fine with it and besides teachers in some states there will be no shifts in the coming future . 
  i 'm sure that if you would ask most germans would say that they like people which perform offical state tasks to be beamte and have taken the oath . 
  well , i suppose most of what you have seen in discussions in r/europe is on refugees and yes , germany may seem to be the europe 's maverick but see it that way : for more than two decades germany has by far not taken its fair share of refugees in europe supporting dublin treaties ( see here the number of refugees in germany and the european union prior to the crisis : https://mediendienst-integration.de/fileadmin/grafiken/asylbewerber_in_der_eu_und_in_deutschland.png ) and the moment germany has to deal with the vast majority of all refugees in europe it demands a fair distribution system . 
  logically , the rest of europe is pissed of . 
  concerning scandals : have fun : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_political_scandals_in_germany on the question wheter germany is socially and economically more or less right than other countries , well this is hard to define . 
  but maybe a few facts . 
  * germany 's economical system is best described as a social market economy ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_market_economy ) based on ordoliberal values . 
  * germany had no federal minimum wage until 2015 . 
  * contrary to america 's fed german national bank and european central bank strictly follow a policy of price stability while fed also has to ensure high employment rates . 
  * after the supreme court ruling gay marriage is legal in 50 out of 50 states . 
  in germany it 's 0 out of 16 ... well , mostly because it 's a federal issue here but with merkel 's party in government we will not see it coming the next years or decades . 
  totally . 
  most of the teachers , especially in the old states : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beamter, 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  highly doubt it . 
  this is germany . 
  if she is already a tenured civil servant there is no way to get her fired . 
  yeah , forget all the information we might have gotten out of this guy . 
  german media state that a psychologist stated every 30 instead of 15 min would be enough . 
  pro refugee , that may be . 
  anti putin , i highly doubt that , i do n't know a single case , sorry . 
  we should not forget that wagenknecht is elected leader of their faction . 
  yes , at the moment no other question other than refugees is a big issue . 
  it was however a bigger issue before 2013 elections , every time our constitutional court rules in favor of gay right 's ( which happens like on a yearly basis ) and after the american supreme court allowed gay marriage in the entire u.s. 
  i 'm going to concentrate only on members of bundestag . 
  the local scandals would fill a book . 
  pro-putin * the left opposes german membership in nato . 
  * sarah wagenknecht , faction leader of the left in the bundestag supports the russian annexation of the crimea , critizes `` the fascist goverment in kiev '' . 
  two left members of a state assembly supported the `` referendum '' , served as `` election observers '' and stated the `` referendum '' ( with russian forces already on the crimean peninsula ) was `` clean '' ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/linkspartei-in-der-krim-krise-putins-freunde-in-berlin-a-959041.html ) * sarah wagenknecht also critized american intervention in syria , comparing it directly to what isis does . 
  on russian-syrian war crimes she has never commented anything and neither another member of the left faction ( https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article150656180/putins-glamour-girl-und-ihr-verlogenes-weltbild.html ) * the left faction calls for an end of sanctions against russia ( https://www.linksfraktion.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/detail/sanktionen-gegen-russland-beenden/ ) antisemitsm * h\u00f6ger , left , member of bundestag once wore a scarf with a map on which israel was completly erased ( http://www.zeit.de/2011/26/antisemiten ) * 14 left members of bundestag left the room when their faction was finally about to pass a resolution against a palaestinian one state-solution which only was drafted after some members of bundestag warned they would leave to the spd ( http://www.zeit.de/2011/26/antisemiten ) * gregor gysi , one the most known left members of parliament and former leader of the opposition who is himself 3/8 jewish was forced to retreat to a bundestag toilet in 2014 after being stalked by two antisemtic journalists invited by groth and h\u00f6ger , two left members of parliament ( http://www.taz.de/antisemitismus-streit-in-der-linkspartei/!5028846/ ) . 
  groth and h\u00f6ger both also participated in the ship-to-gaza-movement and were on board . 
  anti-refugees * sahra wagenknecht , faction leader of the left in the bundestag , critized merkel 's decision of letting refugees in , critized her policy of `` we can do that '' , called for harder policies on refugees and was critized by other left members of parliament for `` critizing merkel from the right flank '' ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/sahra-wagenknecht-linke-schaeumt-nach-aussagen-zu-fluechtlingen-a-1104864.html ), 
  well , it 's mostly the fact that a coalition of spd , greens and lefts would have just a slim majority of 5 members of bundestag . 
  and especially the left party has a lot of communists and other non-rational people , many pro-putin , many antisemitic , many completly anti-refugees . 
  such a coalition would not be able to organize reliable foreign policies at all currently . 
  the left party radicalizes every time the spd shifts a bit to the left . 
  `` we are in favor of 8,50 $ federal minimum wage !, 
  spd supports it now ? 
  well , fuck it , 10 $ it is and without any exceptions even during internships ! '', 
  ( riexinger even calls for 12 $ ) also , let 's not forget that the left party formally is still the sed , the former dictatorship party of the gdr . 
  before 2013 bundestag elections , only 4 % of german voters supported a `` red-red-green '' - coalition . 
  well , she has never cited her personal religious beliefs concerning this issue although she is the daughter of a protestant reverend . 
  i do n't know what were her motivations some time ago but currently i suppose she does everything to avoid loosing conservative party members and voters to the afd . 
  spd got pretty lucky in this coalition if you ask me , the demanded gay marriage but settled for the current coalition treaty ( first federal minimum wage , dual citizenship , pension entry two years earlier if you 've worked 45 years , minimum pension of 850 $ , restrictions on the rise of rents ... ) . 
  the coalitiont treaty even got approval by 75 % of the spd members ( imagine 75 % of labour accepting a coalition treaty with the tories . . ) . 
  also the compensations are mostly the work of spd minister of justice heiko maas who has faced strong opposition by afd , other far right groups and even parts of cdu/csu for doing so ( typical german thinking : `` but at these times , the laws were that way !!, 
  you ca n't change laws afterwards !! '', 
  yeah , they already violated human rights and dignity at that point , smartass . 
  unfortuanatly , you are wrong . 
  it 's the majority of the cdu being opposed to gay marriage . 
  during a tv debate in 2013 , merkel expressed being opposed to gay marriage : `` i have to tell you honestly that i struggle with full equality . 
  i 'm not sure concerning the the children 's wellbeing . '', 
  berlin cdu held an intern referendum on gay marriage in which 52 % of the party members opposed gay marriage . 
  unnecassary to add that the cdu of berlin is one the most liberal parts of the cdu . 
  in 2012 , angela merkel opposed same tax rights for civil unions . 
  shortly after that , german constitutional court ruled not granting them to civil unions is unconstitutional . 
  needless to say that merkel opposed the introduction of civil unions to germany by schr\u00f6der in 2001 cdu blocks the introduction of gay marriage by claiming bundestag would have to amend our constitution although our constitution does not define marriage at all . 
  it 's simple laws which define it . 
  there is a parliamantary majority for gay marriage but the social democrats refuse to support propositions by greens or left party out of loyality to the cdu/csu/spd-coalition and the coalition treaty ( ca n't blame them for that , that 's how coalitions work ) . 
  amending the constitution however would always require the support of cdu . 
  well , this is one of the few issues where merkel does not change her position based on what the majority of germans want . 
  sadly . 
  first sentence is definitly true . 
  a middle east under iranian controll however would be the bloodiest situation . 
  * choose the realistic option which leads to less blood . 
  well , is she that wrong ? 
  i once personally witnessed a heated personal debatte between german vice-chancellor , economy minister ( and therefore responsible for allowing arms deals with foreign states ) sigmar gabriel and an idealist young man on this issue . 
  gabriel told how for instance the question of selling armed patrol boats to al sisi and egypt gave him `` sleepless nights '' ( might also be sleep apnea if you ask me ) . 
  yes , on the one hand you are about to allow a deal with a military dictator killing his people . 
  but on the other hand he also has to deal with isis and others on the sinai peninsula . 
  and the utilitarian aproach is : choose the option which leads to less blood . 
  yes , statistically . 
  came here to say this . 
  honestly guys , at this distance the warning triangle does not bring anything . 
  to be fair , she was leading the polls the weeks before already . 
  i would n't call someone who won the elections running on platform of conservatives , liberals ( and , got ta have to admit greens ) and won against a social democrat left wing . 
  i like your relativism . 
  yep . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminal_case_of_lisa_f . 
  i would be more interested in how russia finances the fn , interferes in germany by creating a false refugee rape scandal and supports brexit . 
  speak russian , can confirm . 
  stil `` holding out '' in germany but you are particulary right . 
  it amazed me when i realized being in new york , that brooklyn alone has double the number of jews in the whole state of germany . 
  yes , indeed . 
  the creation of the state of israel was a major factor since stalin had hopes it would become a socialist state but it became a socialist state for the first decades in a western sense . 
  he had the leaders of all zionist organizations in the soviet union killed , persecuted jews under the indictment of being a rootless cosmopolitan and in 1953 planned the extermination of all jewish doctors during the so called doctor 's plot . 
  university admission exams were no fun for jews at all . 
  every professor saw in your passport the so called fifth line saying you were jewish . 
  jewish students who had the best achievable grade in last year of school were often denied the so called golden medal which would state their high grade . 
  yes , with israel being a major destination country for immigration . 
  but ukraine and belarus saw a similiar drop . 
  i suppose i can have to deal with it . . never saw it this way . 
  funny , my grandmother was not able to become math teacher . 
  no , just simple russian jew whose family came to germany during germany 's immigration plan for post-soviet jews and got naturalized .
