  everyone is a nazi but me , the post, 
  [ stop selling arms to help saudi arabia ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1479/76/1479767524216.jpg ), 
  bunkers , bunkers and bunkers, 
  yep , germany is the wet dream of every authoritarian fascist, 
  you clearly dont . 
  no sane person knowing shit about the law would support this 1935 styled piece of fascist legislation, 
  not volksverhetzung !, 
  quick , burn the basic law and abolish free speech !! 11 !, 
  considering we got this 1935 styled law we sure we cant . 
  its is n't islamist and nazis that loose , but the free society . 
  this law is a great victory for all those people that have n't learned out of history, 
  its even worse , bloggers that are critical of the german goverment on youtube are banned as well https://www.youtube.com/user/styxhexenhammer666, 
  you guys smell this ? 
  its the breeze of fascism . 
  fuck germany , seriously, 
  nah , first one since two month . 
  single isolated cases that have by no means any relecance to the total amount of homicides ? 
  how terrible, 
  what is your fucking point ? 
  those things are by no means mutually exclusive . 
  legal guns and illegal guns are two differe n't things , you dont get less illegal guns by banning legal ones , in fact quite the opposite is the case, 
  it would be harder for law abiding citizens that will never ever hurt anybody with it , this is true . 
  however it would have 0 impact on criminals and terrorists since they dont use effected guns to begin with, 
  tell this to isis and the other terrorist , im however a legal gun owner that wont hurt anybody with my legal registerd gun . 
  you will never ever see my gun , and it will never ever hurt anybody , it has 0 impact on society . 
  if you want to remove weapons from society you should fight against illegal guns , not spreading them even more by creating a bigger black market with stupid regulations, 
  yeah they dont , however they dont tend to come from civillians but from militaries . 
  most illegal ( modern ) guns around in europe are fully automatic leftovers from the yugoslav war , not semi automatic sporting rifles, 
  here take a look at [ this ] ( http://www.monitor.bg/media/articles/2016/03/21819/444-1.jpg ) france has one of the strictes gun laws in europe . 
  basicly all law abiding citizens are disarmed , sure criminals wont get guns anyways . 
  so you think criminals and terrorist ( aka the civilians that harm other civilians ) use legal registerd guns ? 
  yeah , legal semis are the problem ... holy shit . 
  this is a shame for all of europe , sorry we drag you into this swissbros . 
  the czech republic might stop it in the last minute, 
  they are full blown elitists that dont understand the problems of common people , its their own fault, 
  in fact germany is becomming less safe extremly fast , todays crime report showed this verry well . 
  that this is more than 15 years ago prooves my point more than anything else, 
   a le pen or a melenchon presidency would fuck over the eu . 
  ftfy . 
  take my energy le pen !, 
  because you tell criminals where to get guns . 
  especially if the database also includes more info ( like the age of the gun owner ) you basicly give free guns to the one group you dont want to have guns the most, 
  happend in germany too some time ago . 
  gun owner data bases are no good . 
  quite the opposite is true , islamists wish for weak open border leaders , not for patriots that fight them . 
  lets check out the homicide rate of switzerland in the past years , i mean they have such a terrible liberal gun law , it must be a brutal battlefield ... oh no , in fact it was the safest nation in the west in the past years, 
  somebody should have told those terrorist that france has one of the strictes gun laws of the world and that they are n't allowed to own the guns they used . 
  i mean gun control works out so well . 
  also do you know what is n't a statistical abnormality completly ? 
  that switzerland is the country with the lowest homicide rate in the west for manny years now in a row . 
  guess what country is the one with the most liberal gun laws in the west , its switzerland, 
  bullshit , thats simply not true . 
  in 2015 more people died in mass shootings per capita in france than in the us . 
  [ the 90 's ones are to great as they should not be heard tho ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u97ecjwdrvo ), 
  serbia is safe , just look at the numbers . 
  its homicide rate for example is on the same rate as the uk , also it has the second lowest rape rate in all of europe after poland, 
  i dont feel conected to the eu at all . 
  switzerland . 
  maybe also finland or czech republic,

  love it, 
  and i ca n't help but to disagree you , a society also has to pay attention that the needs of the entire nation are listend to , if the us would vote for the president directly the urban population could basicly rule over the rual one . 
  also the us is not a democracy but a republic, 
  nothing . 
  she is n't doing anything about radical islam , she only want to infringe the right of your averange citizen , like it is always after every terrorist attack . 
  [ thuleanperspective ] ( https://youtu.be/3yv4gcktfny ) made a good video about it, 
  i dont like them , they tend to change the constitution as they want . 
  dont like her , but the alternatives are even worse, 
  george soros, 
  it is suprisingly common , manny people forget that we are to some extend also are a emigration country , not only an immigration country . 
  in the last years over 1.5 million german citizens ( so this does not even include non citizen residents ) left the nation , mostly to the us , switzerland , austria , canada , singapore and the netherland, 
  i would support a great western nation on a longer watch , but right now both eu and the states would loose if they would even just join one union . 
  well i agree , calculated and measured data showed that climate change does exist and that it is a natural development , not manmade at all, 
  yeah , my opinion as well, 
  i dont know if i would give up my free speech only to combat those who make climate change propaganda despite it is fake . 
  america is the shield and the sword of freedom and no , they dont kill anybody through climate change since it is n't manmade to begin with, 
  americans are our allies , not our enemies or some bullshit . 
  and even if it would be otherwise we would loose an economic war, 
  we should n't, 
   far right is blue afd is far right ? 
  they sure are not . 
  in basicly all other european countries they would be considerd conservatives, 
  arizona , or maybe texas, 
  only german and english im afraid, 
  also this, 
  i for one fully support it , manny people dont, 
  [ fairly national liberal ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=12.2&amp;d=11.7&amp;g=31.5&amp;s=19.8 ), 
  way to manny would be more propper . 
  you basicly hear about such cases on a weekly base over here, 
  its sad reality, 
  yes , westerners are ruining our state im afraid , or at least they try, 
  better be disliked by western germans than to be enriched by north africans, 
  well , we rather have a stiff arm than one arm length of distance . 
  going into an economic war because some people dont like the democratic choice a nation make is something only an complete idiot would support . 
  by the way , that people that you dont like or dont consider competent can get into power is part of living in a democracy . 
  but you do understand how free marktets work , do you ? 
  i still think saxony is better better of by staying a mostly homogeneous country , its not like you magilcy get einsteins when you welcome third worlders, 
  saxony is often called backwards , some say we dont simply adopt everything comming from the west . 
  truth is probably somewhere between,
