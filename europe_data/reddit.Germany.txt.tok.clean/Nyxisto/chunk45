  if you look at the data of the last few decades automation has n't really driven down work hours at all in the us and only marginally in europe , although automation has been happening at a very rapid pace . 
  it 's a futurology pipe dream , it 's not an empiric prediction at all . 
  will pegida make anime real ? 
  meaningless distinction in this context , the biggest driver behind ulc 's are wages , you can look at real wages directly and get the same picture .

  obviously unit labor costs and wage growth are connected . 
  if your wages outgrow productivity you 're going to see a real growth in wages and purchasing power , but here you can look at the development of real wages in europe directly . 
  http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/eu-real-wage.jpg france is n't in that graph but would be somewhere between italy and spain , and they 've actually almost tripled real wages since the 70s ( [ source ] ( http://static3.businessinsider.de/image/5668bb74dd0895a56b8b4743-945-600/screen%20shot%202015-12-09%20at%206.32.53%20pm.png ) ) the united kingdom is n't relevant here . 
  they pursue an independent monetary policy and the european union can devaluate against the pound if they feel that they 're being threatened by their competitiveness . 
  what is relevant for the european union is wage development inside the currency union . 
  yes , we finally have an increase in demand . 
  too little too late though . 
  we need to catch up almost two decades of stagnation in labour cost and missing the inflation target . 
  what we should be doing right now is running an additional 50-100 billion in public investments every year . 
  we need huge public housing projects , we need to invest into our telecommunications infrastructure and our harbours and other industrial hubs . 
  the multiplier for those investments is probably in the range of 7 to 15 . 
  it 's an absolute no-brainer . 
  wages have n't been stagnant in the western world . 
  that is simply untrue , as you can see in the graph i posted above . 
  there is a strong disparity in unit labor cost in the european union , which i 'll say it again , * renders the currency union dysfunctional *, 
  yes , but that still does n't do anything about the fact that our failure to stick to the 2 % inflation target has helped creating an imbalance in trade that is not correctable in a common currency union . 
  when countries share a currency they need to harmonize wage development because devaluation is n't available . 
  instead we are forcing austerity on the continent which leads to further deflationary spiral and reduction in standard of living in the periphery of europe and does nothing to foster economic growth . 
  i do n't know what artificial is supposed to mean in the context but german wages have stayed way too low for the last fifteen years given that the european inflation target is supposed to be 2 % . 
  ( which is another way of saying that wages are supposed to grow 2 % faster than productivity ) https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/unit-labor-cost-index-2000-100-france-germany-italy-spain-united-kingdom_chartbuilder1.png?w=640&amp;h=360 we 've definitely been hanging on to a beggar-thy-neighbour policy in this regard . 
  we should be where france is in this graph . 
  and too much alcohol consumption during their adulthood . 
  when europe was fighting revolutions the nations were n't under the influence of international forces like they are today , and in return their conflicts are hitting us back in the face . 
  the african continent is still carrying colonial heritage while at the same time being bought up by china . 
  france and the uk did n't go through this . 
  the middle eastern states have literally been drawn into the sand by the european victors of ww i , and so we end up in a globalized world in which local conflicts do not exist . 
  we have caused a considerable amount of these conflicts and so they 're hitting us back into the face in the form of war , poverty , and terrorism . 
  putting the head in the sand wo n't do any good . 
  hmm it 's a little hard to come up with one specific wikipedia article , but you could read mussolini 's [ the doctrine of fascism ] ( http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/reading/germany/mussolini.htm ) , which is pretty much a summation of how nationalism manifested itself in europe and can try to compare that to the american right . 
  what he 's saying is that american nationalism is n't * v\u00f6lkisch * or collectivist . 
  the united states does n't conceive of itself as an ` organic society ' , it 's one that has been built through conscious effort . 
  the american expression of extreme nationalism is self-realization and individualism , not fascism . 
  if you want to go full zizek that is to say that americans reject lacan 's * big other * . 
  well at least until trump that is, 
  then why did you join a union of liberal democracies ? 
  ah yes i forgot , money . 
  `` i worked in the interior ministry of the gdr and i think the government treated me rather nicely , what 's your problem folks ? '', 
  sadly i doubt that a lot of people have the african conflicts on their radar at all . 
  jihadist groups are very active in the maghreb region including morocco and mali . 
  seven un peacekeepers were just killed in mali last week and dozens wounded .

  i love how you 're ignoring the rest of my post , and no i 'm still not making an emotional post . 
  it is what owning a gun is all about , like a caveman with a big axe . 
  having a big loud thing in your hand that makes you feel superior and untouchable , hence the reference to the male sexual organ, 
  i am not making an emotional argument . 
  the homicide rate in the us is several times higher than it is in any western european country . 
  whether you 've personally experienced this or not is n't relevant . 
  the us has several thousand severe gun related accidents every year , in 2010 600 children in the us were killed in gun-accidents , that 's more dead kids than terrorists have produced in the us or europe in the last ten years combined . 
  source for this in the comment to the other guy i replied to . 
  i ca n't even believe that you think nearly 12k gun homicides qualifies as low . 
  it does n't , the rate is insanely high compared to countries with a comparable standard of living . 
  i did n't claim that most people are unresponsible gun owners either , i just said that they do more harm than they do good , which is true . 
  it 's basically a giant phallus to run around with that makes people feel safer the same way people think that their car is safer than an airplane . 
  * this * is the irrational position to adopt . 
  guns are unsafe . 
  you are better of having a well trained police force instead of playing cowboy . 
  terrorism is an absolute non issue when it comes to your personal safety . 
  your chance to die in a terrorist attack is practically zero , so you do n't need a gun for that purpose . 
  you 're more likely to hurt yourself with the thing than actually defending yourself , and that is actually a fact . 
  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/29/guns-are-dangerous-even-when-used-by-good-men.html every year hundreds of kids die in gun accidents in the us alone ( total number of injuries and related deaths is probably even higher ) , which vastly exceeds the victims of terrorism . 
   well , gun laws certainly did n't prevent the terrorists from obtaining weapons . 
  so why should the common citizen be left defenselsess then ? 
  because i do n't want wannabe militias on the street and us numbers of violence . 
  you 're not defenceless , if you 're threatened call the police, 
  that is correct . 
  however to obtain citizenship they need the eight years of residence like everybody else . 
  if you are a highly skilled immigrant ( = you are here on a bluecard ) residence should n't be an issue for you as it is valid for four years and can be easily extended . 
  i do n't agree with you but apart from that i do n't even understand what that has to do with my post . 
  and it is also highly unlikely that those people will get citizenship before you do because it is very common for refugees to stay in legal limbo for over a decade or even their whole life . 
  so in germany there are two things . 
  asylum , which is granted by gg \u00a7 16 ( constitutional right ) and is * only granted to people from neighboring countries * which was a controversial ammendment in the early 90 's ( and makes the whole thing kinda useless ) . 
  as a consequence practically nobody applies under that law ( less than 2 % last year ) . 
  the other one is asylg \u00a7 3.1 , which grants you refugee status under the geneva convention . 
  this grants you temporary residence for three years . 
  almost all refugees right now are applying for this . 
  temporary residence can lead to permanent residence if your case is reviewed and deemed legitimate , and after several years with permanent residence you can naturalize and become a german citizen . 
  so if you are granted asylum you are a refugee . 
  you can be a refugee without applying for asylum . 
  the lingo in the media right now is grossly inaccurate and conflates the terms all the time . 
  go read the other ones if you think this one is bad . 
  i have seen `` merkel fuck yourself '' being upvoted a few dozen times in several other threads . 
  why are these contentless posts even allowed ? 
  you 're really living up to your flair,

   i find it baffling that the pegida / afd people are so hostile against almost every german news source calling them `` lying press '' , while they have no problem with believing rt or other russian state media and some really obvious conspiracy theory magazines . 
  because , news alert , they do n't have a problem with authoritarianism or propaganda , they just do n't like that they are n't the ones in the driver seat,
