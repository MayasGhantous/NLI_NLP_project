  we do n't know the long-term consequences of all the things we have n't tried yet . 
  that does n't mean we should never try something new . 
  if we followed your logic , we would have never allowed the internet . 
  i mean , no one knew the possible long-term consequences of that . 
  all we can do is try to extrapolate using the data we have . 
  and there simply is nothing that makes homosexual marriages seem threatening . 
  children with homosexual parents seem to do just fine . 
  from 1992 :  to date , however , there is no evidence that the development of children with lesbian or gay parents is compromised in any signiflcant respect relative to that among children of heterosexual parents inotherwise comparable circumstances . 
  http://www.cyriltarquinio.com/app/download/5796122297/patterson%2b1992.pdf from 1999 :  the body of literature generally concludes that children with lesbian and gay parents are developing psychologically , intellectually , behaviorally , and emotionally in positive directions , and that the sexual orientation of parents is not an effective or important predictor of successful child development . 
  http://faculty.spokanefalls.edu/inetshare/autowebs/kimt/aw%20articles/children%20of%20lesbian%20and%20gay%20parents.pdf the only remaining problem ( 2011 ) seems to be that same-sex families are not yet fully recognized :  children in same-sex families are generally doing well but their situation could be improved if their parents ' relationship were to be socially and legally recognized . 
  http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/7/1609.long so in other words : no children are at risk , and the sooner lgbt parents are recognized , the better for everyone , including the children themselves . 
  you are correct in pointing out that occurrence in nature does not automatically mean that something is beneficial . 
  cancer occurs naturally , but is not desirable . 
  however , i pointed out the natural occurrence to demonstrate that the lgbt is not a product of socialization , but of physiological processes . 
  consequently , you can not `` make '' someone gay . 
  you further point out that homosexuality does not support the survival of the species and is thus unhealthy for a nation . 
  there are several counterarguments : 1 . 
  from an evolutionary perspective , homosexuality is thought to have [ benefits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biology_and_sexual_orientation#sexual_orientation_and_evolution ) . 
  if you point out the lack of reproduction , please consider that there are many people who are either infertile or choose not to have children . 
  i do n't see conservative efforts to stop them from getting married , however . 
  if homosexuality simply occurs naturally and can not be changed , then there is no need to `` punish '' homosexuals . 
  discrimination against them is only cruel , but does not contribute to societies success . 
  it is to simplistic to reduce the success of a society to reproduction . 
  [ niger is the most fertile land on earth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate ) as measured by its fertility rate . 
  it is also '' [ consistently one of the lowest-ranked in the united nations ' human development index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niger ) '' . 
  even if someone does not reproduce , they can contribute greatly to their country and humanity as a whole . 
  for a prominent lgbt example , think of [ alan turing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alan_turing ) . 
  you go on to imply that lgbt behavior is inherently negative . 
  i do n't see a basis for that . 
  same-sex relationships can obviously also provide many of the economic and social benefits that heterosexual relationships do . 
  you also proceed to compare lgbt behavior , which has no demonstrable negative effects and is not illegal in the developed world , to behavior that has demonstrable negative effects and is illegal in most parts of the world . 
  i ca n't help but see this as a false equation . 
  as for the institution of marriage . 
  it is certainly true that marriage is becoming less important in developed countries . 
  this is to be expected because the economic and social value of marriages becomes smaller as societies find more efficient and stable solutions to social and economical problems . 
  large and stable family clans are important in developing countries and in the past of developed countries because they provide functions that are now provided by official institutions . 
  think of supporting the sick , the elderly , handicapped people , and children . 
  in developed countries , many of these functions are fulfilled using social institutions that better solve problems of inequality , familial collapse , and inefficiencies . 
  as a result , societies become more flexible and each individual becomes more independent . 
  this does not devalue families , it enriches them . 
  families are increasingly free to be units of mutual love , care , and cooperation , where in the past they were often purely economical , instrumental , and political constructs necessary for survival . 
  lastly , you fear that the recognition of another minority in need of protection will hurt other minorities . 
  this is certainly a complex issue . 
  i would still hesitate to think that different minorities must necessarily `` compete '' for attention and help . 
  it is also possible that the recognition of more and more existing inequalities and discriminatory problems is helpful for everyone . 
  discrimination , form an economical perspective , is an inefficient anomaly , after all . 
  helping overcome them increases overall welfare . 
  consequently , even if some groups get a smaller percentage of the cake then before , they still win because the economic cake is now larger than before . 
  as for services for homosexuals : as far as i know , the current ruling does not extend to religious ceremonies . 
  it is only relevant for public , secular institutions . 
  how exactly do you propose that societies change and progress if it is forbidden to talk about anything that goes against the current mainstream opinion ? 
  also , the message is not about changing how most russians behave . 
  no one forces anyone to `` become gay '' . 
  it 's just about letting people live their very own lives in peace . 
  so the lgbt community does not interfere with the rest of russian society . 
  this is just about not being discriminated against , harassed , hurt , or even killed simply for being how you were born . 
  and talking to young people is important , because many young people simply are born lesbian , gay , bi - , or transsexual . 
  so it 's not about changing anyone . 
  it is about protecting those who are , through no fault of their own , different . 
  in the end it comes down to this : is it more important to save some people from seeing lgbt people because they find lgbt somewhat icky . 
  or is it more important to save people who were born differently from having to hide themselves from their own families , their friends , their school mates , their colleagues ? 
  the idea of equality and tolerance is perfectly suitable for children . 
  some try to claim that they want to influence children to become homosexual , but that simply is not true . 
  as i 've argued in a comment above :  ironically , the awful attempts to `` heal '' lgbt people have demonstrated clearly , that you can not change someones sexuality . 
  also , the fact that most all lgbt people were raised by straight parents shows that sexuality does not simply `` rub off '' . 
  lastly , the many examples of homosexuality in many mammals shows that it seems to occur naturally and is n't some form of human `` kink '' . 
  it also demonstrates that it does not endanger the respective populations . 
  to reiterate : there is not a shred of scientific evidence that you can `` make '' people homosexual . 
  also , there is [ growing evidence of genetic factors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biology_and_sexual_orientation ) governing sexuality . 
  the linked article also cites research that shows that even changing the gender of boys shortly after birth does not change their sexuality . 
   in the 1960s and '70s , it was common in developed countries for doctors to castrate boys born with a micropenis and have them raised as girls . 
  however , this practice has come under attack , ** because even though these boys were raised as girls , they nearly all report as adults that they are sexually attracted to women ** . 
  this suggests that their sexual orientation was determined by their genetic gender at birth . 
  if even a surgical procedures followed by years of being treated as a girl can not change a heterosexual boy 's sexual orientation , what could gay `` propaganda '' possibly hope to achieve ? 
  there is even a growing body of research on the evolutionary benefits of homosexuality : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biology_and_sexual_orientation#sexual_orientation_and_evolution this evolutionary perspective is important because it further supports the idea of genetically determined sexuality . 
  it also demonstrates that homosexuality is not a threat to a population . 
  in fact , it might well be an advantage . 
  that is just the [ denotation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denotation ) ( the literal meaning ) . 
  the [ connotation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/connotation ) ( the cultural and emotional association of a word ) is decidedly negative . 
   the term propaganda has acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and jingoistic examples https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=propaganda in contemporary usage , propaganda has the clear connotation of using unfair or unethical methods to advance an unethical cause . 
  using `` propaganda '' to describe a civil rights movement is a clear attempt to portrait activism as subversive and dangerous . 
  ( and coming from germany , i have a really good idea of why propaganda has become a very negative term . 
  i mean , [ joseph goebbels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_goebbels ) was literally the `` reich minister of propaganda '' . ), 
  well , trying to advance the personal rights of homosexuals does not mean that `` homosexualism '' is propagated . 
  what we currently see is what 's called a '' [ spin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spin_\\ ( public_relations \\ ) ) '' in politics or public relations . 
  psychologists would call it [ framing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/framing_effect_\\ ( psychology \\ ) ) . 
  this spin ( or frame ) has two components : firstly , there is the idea of `` homosexualism '' . 
  in some conservative circles in the us , a similar spin is advanced : `` the homosexual agenda '' . 
  the idea is to paint the fight for personal rights of lgbt people as an attempt of the lgbt community to influence `` straight '' people . 
  there is no such thing , of course . 
  ironically , the awful attempts to `` heal '' lgbt people have demonstrated clearly , that you can not change someones sexuality . 
  also , the fact that most all lgbt people were raised by straight parents shows that sexuality does not simply `` rub off '' . 
  lastly , the many examples of homosexuality in many mammals shows that it seems to occur naturally and is n't some form of human `` kink '' . 
  it also demonstrates that it does not endanger the respective populations . 
  secondly , to back up the idea of `` homosexualism '' , the call for basic human rights is reframed as some form of political propaganda * against * straight people . 
  we currently see the similar spins in parts of the us and in the two conservative political parties in germany . 
  gay marriage is only about what consenting people decide to do . 
  some conservatives , however , want to spin this as a violation of their freedom . 
  it takes a bit of , shall we say moral flexibility , to claim that not being able to dictate others how to live their lives is a limitation of your freedom . 
  so there is `` propaganda '' , but noone has heard of it and it is not a topic at all .
