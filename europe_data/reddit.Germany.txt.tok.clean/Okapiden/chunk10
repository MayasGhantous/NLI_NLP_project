  beat france on sunday and we can talk about it !, 
  demands !, 
  demands !, 
  demands !, 
  is all i hear from your islands !!, 
   did they know that every vote counts ? 
  i bet many people thought it was like the usual british thing where the whole nord turns yellow but gets very little power in london regardless of how one-sided it is . 
  well since the referendum is not binding , that is pretty much the case . 
  yeah especially fuck those commuters stcuk in london who had no way of getting home to vote because of the stormy weather . 
  the meaning of ` liberal ' has shifted , just like it did in the us . 
  i remember it being used like an insult in the bible belt . 
  do n't forget how all people upset with the result are of `` the left '' or `` liberals '' . 
  british political discurse is going down the drain meeting up with the american political discourse . 
   islam is not the reason turkey ca n't join the eu . 
  cyprus is . 
  you think populist movements - that are on the rise in virtually every eu country - would ever let that happen ? 
  fear of muslim immigrants was a huge part of the brexit campaign . 
  cyprus is probably the main political reason right now , but if that problem was ever solved , and even if turkey complied with all eu demands afd , fp\u00d6 , national front , lega nord , partij voor de vrijheid and all the likes will never let that happen . 
  when did the holy see join the european union ? 
  yes , but it was probably not as great as many picture it . 
  it was country shaped by militarism , always on the brink of a coup . 
  do you like football ? 
  are you prepared to be part of the most awesome football fans in the world ? 
  well there 's still immigrants and refugees to blame ... 
  britain was just downrated from aaa to aa by s&p , non ? 
  no more british !!, 
   but i guess it depends on the case , but newspapers mention the sexual orientation of ministers , legislature members , etc , all the time and nobody bats an eye . 
  well , then look at the case :  `` the judges who blocked brexit : one founded a european law group , another charged the taxpayer millions for advice ** and the third is an openly gay ex-olympic fencer ** '' that is niot critique - it 's open homophobia . 
  in my book that is hate . 
  simple as that . 
  [ removed ], 
  how could that go wrong ? 
  it 's probably mexicans with fake syrian passports !, 
  so `` native western europeans '' with a lower iq are prone to violent crime ? 
  how about we kill all mentally retarded children before they do our society any harm ? 
  we could also sterilize their parents and at the same time breed blonde arians to create a white master race to control europe . 
  i wonder why no-one has made these observations before you ... 
  you really think the city owns all apartments ? 
  yeah , or kill her which is probably the next thing they 're planning on !, 
  wake up sheeple !, 
  all flats in her city are unsuitable ? 
   all because the local authorities have decided refugees get priority over german nationals . 
  define priority . 
  it 's not like they 're renting this flat out to the refugees . 
  maybe you should rephrase it as : in a scenario where one person can move for others to have shelter they would otherwise not have the priority is for person a to move . 
   . . and as another poster pointed out all this will do is antagonise relations between refugees and natives . 
  if this case is used as it is in this thread that may be . 
  i love how you claim a lack of empathy on my side and then try to insult me on the other . 
  where is your empathy ? 
  are n't you sorry for my lack of friends ? 
  generally yes , but evictions without notice * can * be in compliance with german law . 
  i just do n't like how certain people in this thread try to make it look like the woman is homeless now - which she clearly is n't . 
   why does this distinction matter ? 
  because she is still in the flat and has nine months to find a new place ? 
  i read ` you ' instead of ` they ' . 
   insistence that everyone is a basketcase claiming that the eu is kicking it in the bucket . 
  really ? 
  you want me to quote from the thread ? 
  http://www.focus.de/immobilien/kaufen/38-600-immobilien-bund-verkauft-alle-seine-wohnungen_id_4307443.html  perhaps it is a new development , i do n't know . 
  privatization of public property is a new development ? 
  where have you been the last 20 years ? 
   nope , it was mentioned by the mayor in the interview that the woman had been granted a generous timespan to look for a new flat . 
  you are blending out the things that contradict your version of events . 
  no , you wrote that i tried to make it like it was `` a great gesture '' by the mayor . 
  please provide a quote where i even mention the mayor . 
   lol , well pardon me for having empathy with that woman . 
  lovin ' / r/europe . 
  kids drown or get pepper sprayed =  propaganda !, 
  woman has her contract cancelled and has nine months to find a new place =  omg she 's practically homeless . 
  the eu is about to collapse !, 
  ... while yelling `` dey tok a jaaaaaaaarbs '' in our kkk uniforms made in bangladesh . 
  a mega thread on the current refugee situation ? 
  well that would essentially destroy any sand discussion on that topic , but it might be worth it , if all the scum was kept in there . 
   this is actually a valid reason . 
  the thing is , when you move in a municipal flat like this there is something you absolutely expect and are justified in making assumption about - that nothing like this will happen short of a highly unusual occurence . 
  a flat like this means stability and people live there for a really , really long time if they want to precisely because the state does n't have a niece that might want to move in , and usually they do n't just sell those flats out on a whim , either . 
  interesting , when the reality is that municipal flats are sold in masses - the federal government has been selling 1000 to 3000 objects per year and in 2014 the plan was to sell all 38600 objects . 
  but expectation and justified assumptions !, 
   the nine months that the mayor is stressing is not some grand gesture on the city 's behalf . 
  it 's ridiculous that they are trying to depict it as such . 
  it 's the bare minimum prescribed by the law . 
  the minimum . 
  the mayor is stressing that ? 
  i quoted the law , not the mayor . 
  and where was i trying to depict it as a grand gesture ? 
  you 're interpreting things . 
   i love my current place but i understand that i wo n't stay living here for longer than a couple of years . 
  if i were to get a notice from my landlord , it would be shit . 
  but it has n't been my home for 16 fucking years , so i would be ok finding something else . 
  besides , i do n't work nightshifts and do n't have to search alone . 
  it 's not like she 's got nine months with nothing else to do but looking for a new home , for eff 's sake . 
  kicking her out would be regarded as an asshole move pretty much by default no matter who 's doing it , state or private landlord , especially because there is no valid reason to do so . 
  * sad violin music starts playing * i never said it was n't a big deal . 
  but making it look like she 's living in the streets now is - to say it in / r/europe 's terms : propaganda . 
  same goes for people who think the western world is collapsing because of this . 
  but what would the rules be ? 
  how do we measure the racism ? 
  i unsubbed / r/europe a while ago , but then reconsidered , because i 'm not going to let a few fucktards run their circlejerk unobstructedly . 
  but just look at all these buzzwords being thrown left and right . 
  injured children are always propaganda , but [ this woman who had her contract cancelled ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m8fxc/f%c3%bcr_fl%c3%bcchtlinge_gek%c3%bcndigt_das_war_wie_ein_tritt/ ) and who has 9 months to find a new place is [ practically homeless ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m8fxc/f%c3%bcr_fl%c3%bcchtlinge_gek%c3%bcndigt_das_war_wie_ein_tritt/cvdlvdw ) !,
