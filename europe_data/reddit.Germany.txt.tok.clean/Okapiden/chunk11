   she ca n't live wherever she wants to . 
  * sigh * okay , let 's rephrase it : she can apply for any flat that she can afford . 
   she 's been kicked out of her home where she has lived for 16 years . 
  no , her contract has been cancelled . 
  and because she has lived there for that long she has ** 9 months ** before she actually has to move out . 
  not what i would call `` kicking out '' . 
   that 's where she has wanted to live . 
  you know i wanted to live where i was before , but they renovated the whole house to sell the flats . 
  where is my uproar ? 
   plus the article mentions that it 's been impossible for her to find something because of her pet which is absolutelty true * maybe * she will find a place in nine fucking months . 
   so yes , she is being left homeless . 
  ridiculous . 
  i am aware of an actual brain drain , but i would bet that a whole bunch of educated people would leave romania even if they would not earn five times as much . 
  i 'm just confused about citizens from the countries that receive the most funds complaining about the eu destroying their country - and not complaining about brain drain , but complaining about a cancelled contract of a tenant living in germany . 
  you think they were thrown in because they had an argument about religion ? 
  the rest did n't do anything ? 
  you could almost think they did n't because they were afraid of being thrown off as well . 
  because this is what happened : a group of assholes threw others off of a boat . 
   you might not share my mentality but if i saw people being killed for no reason i 'd try and do something about it . 
  i would * never * back down in a dangerous situation if someone else were in danger . 
  \\* takes a sip from his beer and puts his feet on the living room table \\*, 
  they are throwing off people of boats from within the eu ? 
  is this happening in the english channel ? 
  i was thinking of social status . 
  and as i said : go ahead . 
  do n't forget to submit the results to / r/europe . 
  til the 8000 uneducated romanian roma in berlin are considered brain drain . 
  last time i checked orban considered the decreasing birthrates among roma a `` success '' . 
  go ahead , but do n't forget to compare them to the same demographic . 
  yup . 
  you should expel all those asshole normans . 
  freeloading since 1066 !, 
  / r/europe - do n't attack our christian culture , and do n't expect us to do what that hippie jesus told his followers to do . 
  you know if we took the numbers of murder and/or rape committed by british citizens i bet it was n't a handful either . 
  so if they throw of muslims or hindus that would n't be as bad ? 
  and all of them threw of a christian ? 
  it 's almost as if you were generalizing . 
  prime example of making mountains out of molehills . 
  she can live wherever she wants to , but if the landlord cancels your contract because of `` eigenbedarf '' then that is tough luck . 
  but maybe you 're right , and the end of times is here . 
  ** fyi for all the people who somehow get the idea she was evicted : ** she was not evicted , her contract got cancelled . 
  german law requires cancellation periods for landlords that depend on the time you lived in the flat . 
  if you lived in the flat for up to 5 years , you get ** 3 months ** before you have to move out . 
  the maximum time is what you get when you live there 8 years or more , which is ** 9 months ** before you actually have to move out . 
  she got kicked out ? 
  source ? 
  because the article clearly stated her contract got cancelled . 
  she has plenty of time to move out . 
  ** german law actually states that if a tenant lives in a flat for 8 years or longer the cancellation period is nine months . 
  ** you doubt she will find anything in nine months ?!, 
  also : she 's 51 - are you telling me she 's ready to retire with 51 ? 
  moving is not a great thing ( at least to most people ) , but no reason to act like a tragedy happened . 
  good thing i `` attacked '' you , so you can keep ignoring the facts and keep whining about it . 
  edit : your downvotes only make you look pathetic . 
  why did you not read the article ? 
  or do you have problems with reading and understanding ? 
  the article clearly stated that she was a single mom , but her sons moved out already . 
  she 's shares the 90m \u00b2 with her dog . 
   and it totally makes sense to help displaced persons by displacing other persons . 
  while the woman can move into another flat , the refugees ca n't , and the local authority are actually required to provide a certain amount of living space for refugees . 
  how about you educate yourself before spouting nonsense ? 
  yeah if we just shot them on sight they would n't even enter the eu , amirite ? 
  wow and i thought romania had received several billion euros ( around 20 in fact ) from the eu from 2007 to 2013 and is still receiving plenty up to today . 
  not mentioning all those migrant workers that moved to western eu states ... 
  they terminated her contract , but they did n't kick her out - she has time to move . 
  i 'm not saying it 's not a dick-move , but ( as the article states ) this happens every day in thousands of cases where the owner wants the flat for themselves . 
  actually she can be glad to have lived in government owned property for that long , since most government-owned real-estate was sold in the past few years to private investors , and they are quick to raise rents , or kick you out to sell the flats instead of renting them out . 
  homeless ? 
  she can move into another flat ? 
  she does n't get evicted immediately , she has time to find a new place . 
  i 'll go for `` elvis returned to his home planet '' next time . 
   agenda oh boy , here we go again . 
   also , appeal to ridicule is still a logical fallacy ridicule is not constructive in any way , but you should look up the big words before you use them . 
   i never said hungary did n't break any regulations . 
  no , but you think you know exactly that the only regulation that was broken was `` in a state of semi-suspension '' . 
  we will see about that . 
   and no , i do n't know what critieria a country has to meet to be officially considered safe . 
  i hoped the `` come on '' part suggested that i 'm talking about a personal opinion and not an official stance . 
  but neither personal opinion , nor logic do necessarily concur with eu regulations - i am sure we agree on that . 
  you took that seriously ? 
  i would n't call germany / / hungary world-wide . 
   serbia is not saudi arabia other countries being worse has what to do with it ? 
   i am sure their asylum process is fair enough . 
  i am sure that assessment will suffice to change the eu policy . 
  i am sure that your definition of `` fair enough '' does so as well . 
  criteria include e.g. 
  that the country guarantees a fair consideration of any asylum applications , not that the country is not a warzone , or that you could spend your holidays there without being shot . 
  the fact that i ask for relevance implies a ) this is an irrelevant example and b ) tropes vs. women is not relevant for the better or the worse . 
   hungary is actually in compliance with the eu regulations i was not aware of the fact that we had an eu commissioner among us , who has investigated everything already . 
  someone give this man/woman flair so everyone knows !, 
   it 's worth mentioning that hungary still processed a considerable amount of registrations . 
  which * would * equalize a possible noncompliance again ? 
   the only other questionable thing is the law that considers serbia a safe country , but come on , serbia is a safe country . 
  i have the feeling that you are not aware of the criteria that have to be met so a country is officially considered safe . 
  what kind of commissioner are you ? 
  syrians ca n't melt hungary . 
   they will not find anything most probably . 
  you think hungary is being investigated * because * the let asylum applicants apply for asylum in hungary ? 
  yeah , especially the wars were really great . 
  let 's keep the muslims out .
