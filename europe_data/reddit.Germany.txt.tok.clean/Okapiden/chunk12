  european wars should be exclusively christian-jewish !, 
  you 're acting like hungary was in compliance with the asylum regulations of the eu . 
  there might be a reason why the eu commission started investigating hungary ( but also others like france and germany ) for not being in compliance with it . 
   reddit is what you 'd call silencing free speech under the guise of `` hate speech '' . 
  even if you 're 100 % right you 'd still get downvoted . 
  implying you wo n't get upvoted with these opinions in / r/europe . 
  the difference is in / pol / everyone is open racist and nobody cares . 
  here someone will occasionally oppose you , but the downvote brigade attacks , and afterwards you get to complain about the liberal thought police . 
   say the feminist things that have been happenng on the internet the past year or so . 
  i mostly read all the sources . 
  i look at antia sarksiesn videos . 
  i do n't downvote them on youtube . 
  there no point . 
  it 's not going to change anything . 
  but a lot of people do n't understand that . 
  relevance ? 
   i love when you 're on redit in a 1:1 conversation and the guy goes and downvotes every single one your replies . 
  i 'm like what the fuck dude . 
  really ? 
  are you 10 years old and ca n't handle some criticism ? 
  like that was exclusive to people of any one opinion . 
  welcome to / r/europe !, 
  enjoy your stay . 
  berlin has taken in a lot of refugees already . 
  it does n't even matter what the context is , does it ? 
   it equates things that for example a christian-democratic interior minister has said like there is `` no universal right to be granted asylum in the country of your choice '' with the slur `` fucking leftist '' . 
  everything in this bingo is a direct quote from this subreddit , nothing else . 
  if some racist in this sub used a quote directly from someone else ( without marking is as such ) then that is not my business . 
   in that way i do n't see you in any way different from the nazis and fascist here the difference is i 'm not part of the circlejerk going on in every single of these threads . 
  i also do n't act like there is a thought police . 
  my claim is that there is a difference about a majority of people complaining about being oppressed and sitting on the top of every / r/europe thread and a minority that is lucky if their posts get a cross before being hidden from view permanently . 
   you are not willing to learn anything that you do n't already know if i want to learn i read other subreddits , and when i feel masochist i enter / r/europe . 
  apart from that i have learnt enough about racism and nazism in germany . 
   and you are an asshole for calling me one , unprovoked . 
  you were not meant , unless you fit into the description above - in that case it was not unprovoked . 
  hold on . 
  i 'm supposed to engage these people ? 
  the way i am engaged here as well ? 
  there was a submission to / r/europe about `` worried citizens '' in italy who torched furniture intended for refugees . 
  i complain about fascists , and get voted down into oblivion , while people tell me that these are just worried people , not fascists . 
  i could actually go on about all the posts where i simply state facts ( e.g. 
  applying for asylum is a human right in europe ) and get downvoted all the while i 'm being told that the very people who do that are just worried , not racists , nazis or fascists , but this post will just get buried like the rest . 
  it 's like those assholes who keep burning refugee shelters , and when you call them nazis , you 're being informed that they 're just `` worried '' . 
  and at the same time the top comments in literally 9/10 posts is `` finally someone who speaks his mind . 
  europe is full of pc thought police liberal morons , etc. 
  etc. '', 
  there is people with obvious nazi-nicknames ( e.g. 
  hitler or white supremacy directly in their fucking nicknames ) who tell me `` calling everyone nazi is dank bro , racist is a buzzword '' . 
  no , ya 'll not worried , you 're racists , assholes and fascists . 
  i really wish there was a way to analyse the number of posts and sort them via regular expressions , and this charade of nazis in disguise would be finally over . 
  sadly some of the `` best '' replies were deleted before i made this . 
   good luck when they get to your city . 
  yeah i wonder if they will ever arrive in berlin . 
  and right here we have the very definition of a circlejerk . 
  you did n't even read the article , did you ? 
   yeah because being anti-immigration equals being right-wing and a closet nazi . 
   unholy88 checks out , i guess . 
  like [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jdxl8/pakistani_citizen_tries_to_rape_german_women_near/ ) ? 
  riot police standing by , but not riot police e.g. 
  teargassing people . 
  nobody is fighting the police there . 
  you must be a sad and bitter person to see conflict and violence everywhere . 
  innocent kid tactic ? 
  i see no conflict on this photo ? 
  i think it 's powerful photo . 
  as far as i am informed they 're ( among possibly other things ) not considered safe because they ca n't guarantee a fair asylum process . 
   that gate has damn gates on it yo dawg ...  and since when are humans that [ ... ] are called civilized ? 
  * that * is the definition of uncivilized ? 
  is that on your scale ? 
  there were civilizations that did human sacrifices ...  [ ... ] put children in front of the riot just for sympathy , or throw them over the fence to get through [ ... ] yes , they were looking for sympathy , but sherlock reddit foiled their evil plan . 
  no more sympathy !, 
  we did it reddit !, 
   oh and about other countries containing them , lets talk when slovenia has to register 150k immigrants . 
  which changes guaranteed human rights how again ... ? 
  there are enough people from europe who stay in turkey for their holidays . 
  but turkey being subjectively safe does n't change how the eu officially perceives turkey . 
  and if you 'd look at the map yourself you would see that you had trouble coming from syria to hungary through `` dozens of safe countries '' . 
  unless you were to run in circles you would n't even cross one dozen countries . 
  someone else claimed there were `` dozens '' of safe countries , and i wanted to know which dozens those were . 
  if you do n't want to answer in his place , you do n't have to . 
  but what makes you think you can hitchhike another 's comment and demand anything from me ? 
  why is one safe country not enough ? 
  i do n't know , i 'm not the one who claimed refugees were crossing dozens of safe countries ; maybe you should ask the guy i replied to ? 
  i do n't know why they ca n't stay in turkey . 
  maybe they were rejected ? 
  who knows , but turkey is only regarded as a safe country of origin by * one * eu member state , which is bulgaria . 
  as for greece . 
  if they come via turkey , bulgaria , serbia , why would they make a detour via greece ? 
  as i told the other guy : there are no `` dozens '' of safe countries , unless you run in circles . 
  exactly the picture i was thinking of !, 
  turkey is not in europe ? 
  look at the map on the right . 
  til 3 = dozens . 
  in germany a dozen is 12 , so dozens would imply multiples of 12 . 
  i also wonder how you would come from e.g. 
  syria and cross turkey and greece to go to hungary . 
  quite a strange route . 
  well eu law might 've been a bit misleading ; it 's here : http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information/docs/2_eu_safe_countries_of_origin_en.pdf so right now only bulgaria considers turkey safe . 
  i am ? 
  i think you were trying too hard with your submissions to / r/unitedkingdom and / r/ukpolitics .
