  not even if they wanted to . 
  second of all : we have plenty of inner eu immigration guaranteed by eu legislation . 
  so plenty of people who will come to * your * country and will work for pennies . 
  but again : what does that have to do with people protesting against refugees from syria , etc. ? 
  but since you started the topic of immigration : actually a lot of countries are benefiting * a lot * from immigration , since there are a lot of highly trained professionals coming in , such as doctors , engineers etc. 
  these are not taking away your manual labor job . 
  and in case they are , let me inspire you with this quote of louis ck : http://i.imgur.com/shdmf0l.jpg, 
   a lot of fascists would like to start their own country tho , is n't that helping them ? 
  i doubt they will amount to anything . 
  a lot of them are content with complaining about immigrants and cashing welfare-cheques . 
   either way , people have the right to protest the decisions of their government - and if their voice isnt heard , they reach for more aggressive means in my book you lose the right to voice your opinion if you `` reach for more aggressive means '' . 
  you can voice your opinion all you want , but why does that mean you get to dictate public opinion . 
  `` the government wo n't listen to me , so i get the right to burn shit and get violent ! '', 
   and can you blame them ? 
  have any anti immigration protests actually worked ? 
  this is about refugees . 
  why are people constantly mixing up refugees and immigrants ? 
  i also wonder when you would consider an anti-immigration protest `` working '' . 
  as a german i can tell you we had a few `` working '' protest a few years back . 
  they also burned some stuff and in the end those `` unwanted aliens '' were deported . 
  ca n't we all agree on deporting 1 fascist for every refugee we take in ? 
  i love how people are downvoting me for writing something against fascists !, 
  keep em coming !, 
   because his position is backed by the german public opinion . 
  according to whom ? 
  what was the question ? 
  is wolfang sch\u00e4uble the best secretary of finance ever , or do you torture animals ? 
  he 's a guy who once lost a briefcase with 10k ( or was 100k ? ), 
  in it and forgot about it afterwards . 
  i have no idea why anyone approves of him - especially as minister of finance . 
  question : what about all the debt ? 
  especially the stuff that is owed in euro ? 
  believe it or not , but there are enough of us who want an sch\u00e4ubxit . 
   that the germans will admit they erred and what they proposed could never have worked ? 
  what mistake did i make ? 
  what did i propose ? 
  and where i my lackeys ? 
  i 'm not sure about the other guy , but my negative picture of kohl is based on other things than the reunification , e.g. 
  a system of bribery and the following clean up . 
  interestingly enough there is a bunch of that on the german wikipedia , while the english version has two sentences and a link . 
  just look at this [ buttload of awards ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/helmut_kohl#auszeichnungen_und_ehrungen_.28auszug.29 ) he got . 
  and this list is just an excerpt . 
  as far as i see that seems pretty true . 
  today nobody is talking about `` system kohl '' all the fraud , the missing suitcases full of money , and how the german government evaded paying greece wardepts . 
  people remember him as the chancellor of reunification . 
  and the irony with so many germans complaining about greek spending on arms , when they buy tanks from germany . 
  on the other hand they are a nato member , so they ~ ~ have to ~ ~ are supposed to spend 2 % of their gdp for arms . 
  looks a little ironic as well though considering the greek gdp was so super inflated . 
   germany has never repaid its debts . 
  i 'm really not saying germany did n't screw over greece and evaded paying reparations to greece after wwii - in fact i do n't even feel like i ca n't even judge that , but germany paid a lot of reparations ; in fact germany only finished paying the debt for wwi in 2010 which amounted to a total of 200 billion euro . 
  [ german source ] ( http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/deutschland-bezahlt-letzte-kriegsschulden-aid-1.2292350 ) so saying germany never repaid it 's debts seems to be misleading , when in fact germany is still paying back it 's wwii debts . 
  while this is all true , i wonder at which point the current government made it look like they had nothing to do with it . 
  for a `` left '' government they did surprisingly ~ ~ little ~ ~ nothing to stop tax fraud and further tax the millionaires . 
  they just stood and watched while the money left the country . 
   good luck pushing your russian agenda elsewhere ridiculous . 
  any time russians post bullshit on / r/europe they get downvoted into oblivion . 
  nobody here is putting up with russian propaganda . 
  that said : does n't mean anyone will accept any other bullshit either . 
  and asking for validation is a standard thing on / r/ama and has nothing to do with `` russian agenda '' . 
  if you ca n't validate the guy you might want to check if he is actually who he claims he is , and not someone who is fooling you as well . 
  op will surely deliver . 
  your points are valid and true , but let 's not forget that austerity cost them a quarter of the gdp ... 
  it really is - although she never wore that outfit again . 
  she got a lot of bad publicity for losing what seems like a lot of weight , but i 'm not judging anyone on their weight ; that 's her business . 
  but yeah , she looks different from back then . 
  that reminds me : are you aware , of her [ changing quite a bit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/frebfwf.jpg ) in the last years ? 
  time to buy new candles for the shrine !, 
  i have the feeling you would call every party further right than the cdu far right . 
  would you define the csu as far right ? 
  after all they have similar stances in a lot of cases . 
  i think he was trying to get texas to secede , which is kind of the opposite in this case . 
  ukip is maybe as far right as the afd is in germany . 
  they are right alright , and they have some extreme right voters , but they 're not as far right as the npd . 
  people keep connecting esc to the lgbt community . 
  [ i think there 've been enough straight men enjoying it as well ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0chwjuk.jpg ) . 
  well it insulted putin by wasting the shitload of money russia put into it 's performance . 
  i really thanked lordi for that this evening . 
  that 's a lot more activity than in the federal party combined . 
  i see actively working pirates in a lot of aussch\u00fcsse . 
  where and how did they extend their political spectrum ? 
  the regional election where they proposed a lot of non-it topics ( e.g. 
  seperation of church and state ) was the one in berlin . 
  i have n't seen any meaningful attempts to broaden their topics on a federal level - the opposite is true : there was a lot of animosity between the progressive berlin pirates and the bundesvorstand ( federal executive board ? ), 
  when the latter tried to dictate the former 's policies . 
  russia 's justification for crimea is a democratic referendum . 
  there 's no need for any stronger justification . 
  last time i checked keeping your hands out of other country 's businesses had a ** really ** high priority for russia . 
  you know like how people complained about the ( non-existent ) human rights in chechnya , and russia basically claimed that this was nobody 's business except russia 's . 
  ironically chechnya also wanted autonomy , non ? 
  what happened to their referendum ? 
  oh they did n't have one ? 
  their ~ ~ dictator by russia 's grace ~ ~ democratically elected leader kadyrow did n't let them have one ? 
  could you tell us a little bit of what the pirate party does in iceland ? 
  are they `` only '' regarding `` internet/computer topics '' or other things as well ? 
  i 'm asking because the pirate party in germany pretty much died because of this concentration on only this one topic , with the exemption of the pirate party in berlin that has a progressive approach and also addresses many other topics like social politics , the airport disaster , etc. . . 
  [ a caricature * always * has a subject . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=caricature ) i 'm also not sure if you understood it correctly . 
  do you think they 're making fun of the imf or the greek because they 're not french ? 
  there are caricatures that work without context ? 
  are you sure you do n't mean cartoons ?
