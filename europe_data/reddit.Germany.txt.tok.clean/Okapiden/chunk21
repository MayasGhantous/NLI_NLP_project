  i 'm not even saying people should not be able to control immigration into their countries , but xenophobia is still xenophobia if the foreigner has a job . 
  ** til **, 
   if they have a job and are able to support their family , reunification should n't be much of a problem . 
  yeah those syrian families should learn finnish before coming here . 
  i mean there is [ not even a finnish embassy in syria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_diplomatic_missions_of_finland ) but if you do n't wan na die , you 'll find someone to teach you finnish , right ? 
  do you have sex with urinals ? 
  ca n't have been a school or the university in cologne then . 
   since your genitalia come in contact with much fewer objects and hands ( i hope ! ) . 
  do n't tell me what to do !, 
  same question for soap and toilet paper . 
  edit for clarification : i 'm not using this as an excuse , but my school and the university in cologne have nop decent toilets . 
  in fact i would rather go home when i had a time in between classes to do business . 
  you 're just touching your dick - the very same one that you will probably not wash all day after urinating . 
  well what elso ya gon na do with all of those hands ? 
  turkey is a secular state after all !, 
  if it 's your own keyboard and mouse , why would you ? 
  nobody else will introduce new pathogens . 
  and since you yourself will wash your own hands when you get home ... where 's the point ? 
  but during my job ( in it ) i frequently touch other people 's mouse & keyboard , and then i will frequently wash my hands . 
  it used to work for me as well , but when you 're the only one of 4 people who does so ... ; _ ;, 
  honestly : judging from the times i have seen people just walk past me while i was washing my hands in a public restroom - i really doubt the german number is acurate . 
  well , why is he not sitting in a submarine aiming a torpedo at erdogan ? 
  well , why is he not sitting on a horse that kicks erdogan ? 
  which is why i would think putin aiming a gun at erdogan would look `` realistic '' . 
  why is putin not pointing a gun at erdogan ? 
  broomsticks for our panzy-tanks !, 
  as a german , ... where the fuck is our aircraft carrier ? 
  same reason that there 's an anti-air frigate : they always escort the charles de gaulle . 
  yeah and [ 10 % of all germans want a `` strong leader '' , and 25 % wish for a strong party that represents the `` national unity '' . 
   yes because there is no middle ground between zero attempts to prosecute and torturing people without a trial or evidence . 
  who said so ? 
   if sweden has the highest percent of isis members returning to europe and it can not get enough evidence on a single person to hold a trial then the law enforcement agencies are incompetent or simply not trying . 
  how come * you * know that they 're all daesh members if even law-eforcement can not come up with evidence ? 
  well it 's certainly a different approach than arresting , interning and torturing people based on a suspicion . 
  there are enough people who have been in guantanamo who turned out innocent , e.g. 
  well in germany it 's a crime to be a member of a terrorist organization . 
  if people travelling to countries like syria , pakistan , etc. 
  they 're usually questioned when they return , and if there is any trace of a connection between them and any terrorist group they get jail time . 
  but as you said : travelling itself is n't criminal , and there are enough that are n't stupid and cover their tracks . 
  so i get to burn something when someone misbehaves ? 
  are there other reasons that justify arson as well ? 
  in other news : the space pope is reptilian . 
  in which universe is it someone else 's fault when someone shoots down a plane ? 
  no , since these are n't `` social welfare apartments '' but homeless shelters . 
  i do n't understand why people who found jobs , got kids , etc. 
  stayed in there , but they did . 
  apparently they 've been run down for a while , and were meant to be demolished for a while , but that never happened until now , where the municipality needs the space to build shelters for the refugees . 
  i wonder if you always take humor literally if it conflicts your views . 
  slovakia uses the lack of mosques as a ridiculously lame `` excuse '' to not take in refugees , when they 're in fact obliged to take them in - at least to let them apply for asylum . 
  do you honestly believe this is a serious excuse ? 
  i mean the way you seem to seriously think john oliver actually wants them to build mosques ... 
  * after * slovakia claimed it could n't take in muslim refugees ** because there were no mosques ** . 
  are you * acting * stupid ? 
  what 's ` money food ' ? 
  [ looks like it does so in english . 
  who 's talking about op ? 
   got ta love academics and the laughable bullshit that they spout . 
  what ? 
  i was actually mocking his pride of not receiving higher education . 
  edit : it 's not even possible to take part in this program , since it does n't even exist , since it was just a thought experiment , but fucking thinking , right ? 
  stupid and proud of it !, 
  uneducated of europe , unite !, 
   the few true refugees yeah roughly a quarter million people died in the syrian civil war ( plus countless more in iraq , syria , etc. 
  ) , but when the people come and make use of their right that they 're guaranteed by law , then shithole eastern european countries are suddenly the defenders of `` european values '' , when the only reason they joined the eu were the monetary benefits they were expecting ( and being granted ) from the eu . 
  there are equally many racists here in the west that were happy to kick out the freeloaders from the east , that also take away the jobs of the residents here as there are racists in the former eastern bloc that are afraid of refugees doing to them what they themselves are doing to the eu . 
  it 's really nice when you do n't have to follow bullshit-pc - `` though police '' rules , right ? 
   i 'm really annoyed by the fact that people here need to have everything wrapped in a sweet pill with sugar on top . 
  you either agree with the idea , or you do n't . 
  the form should not be all that relevant . 
  are people on this subreddit this superficial ? 
  finally somehow who agrees with me . 
  why sugarcoat that romania and hungary are essentially europe 's retarded cousins that only exist to supply ( cheap ) labor for the developed west . 
  that is because islam , just like christianity , has countless different religion confessions . 
  but for / r/europe only muslims/arabs exist . 
   the united states endures more blackouts than any other developed nation as the number of u.s. power outages lasting more than an hour have increased steadily for the past decade , according to federal databases at the department of energy ( doe ) and the north american electric reliability corp. http://www.ibtimes.com/aging-us-power-grid-blacks-out-more-any-other-developed-nation-1631086, 
  i love how suddenly everyone is worried about germany . 
  do n't disturb the circlejerk . 
  and do n't think the people in here are the ones that are afraid . 
  they 're the once trying to spread the fear . 
  negligible . 
  europe 's using to little water anyways - in fact cities started to put special gel mats into sewers , because people save so much water , the waste does n't get flushed away properly . 
  and unlike the us europe has a decent power grid that does is not in danger of a constant collapse . 
  with vw 's new software we can fit all refugees into one car and it only uses 1l of fuel per 100km . 
  * that * is going to happen anyways . 
   its not limited to `` social welfare apartments '' that 's a nice way of expressing the fact that it has nothing to do with `` social welfare apartments '' . 
   it 's not social welfare housing , just normal apartments it 's just this little detail that changes the whole thing ...  since the city has trouble convincing owners of empty apartments to take in refugees ( even though everything would be paid for ) , they decided that it would be easier to move the tenants of the houses they own themselves and helped them find new apartments . 
  no , since the city has either not planned and built enough shelter in the past , or since the city has not kept the existing shelters in decent condition ( and this is the majority of cities ) they now have a problem with fulfilling their quota . 
   so to solve the problems we need to give them no to very little benefits , then only those truly seeking refuge come here . 
  i think you confused taking in refugees with cherry-picking engineers and other highly-trained western european immigrants . 
  at least i 'm not suggesting the inhumane and illegal treatment of refugees ? 
  so brave, 
  that would be the first time / r/europe heard of those . 
   dublin so , since they 're right in the middle they take 0 refugees ... right ? 
   we  switzerland * we * have a common strategy ? 
  i thought switzerland was all about locking itself in and keeping everyone else out ... 
  white power ? 
  it is everything that is submitted to / r/europe anymore . 
  anything that opposes the racist worldview is manipulative agenda , everything else is the truth . 
  at the same time sockpuppets behind tor nodes upvote the same shitty content to the top day after day , but finally someone is speaking the truth , right ? 
  my definition includes a bunch of people of the same opinion who jerk each other 's virtual wangs by confirming each other 's opinion .
