  like garfield or peanuts ? 
  you 're meaning to say that not all french are snobby parisians ? 
  just google `` sweden russia airspace '' and you will find plenty of articles . 
  russia invades nato airspace with the same frequency . 
  apparently they are testing reaction times . 
   and that wo n't change after acquiring a french company that 's pretty much as fucked ( when it comes to mobile phones ) as nokia . 
  you are aware of the fact that alcatel produces more than mobile phones ? 
  ( do they even produce any mobile phones any more ? ), 
  ( probably among other things ) they produce telephones for companies , and the company i work at uses their phones exclusively . 
  and if country a has n't even joined a military alliance , but country b keeps sending military aircraft , and possibly submarines into country a 's borders again and again , what should country a do ? 
  if i see it correctly sweden is already a target for the russian military . 
  the only question is : if there 's gon na be an attack will sweden stand alone , or will nato retaliate ? 
  while invading swedish airspace with bombers time and time again . 
  refugees are not immigrants and the rights of refugees are guaranteed by the geneva convention - but why am i expecting an american to respect , or know the geneva convention ? 
  gary oldman is still alive !, 
  this years british contribution was a new low , but you guys still got more points than germany ... 
   in worlds ' history only few dictarors authoritarian/totalitarian presidents took power by other means than a democratic election . 
  what ? 
  there 's a coup about every other week in an african country . 
  those are all not democratically elected . 
  same goes for the people who obviously game the elections . 
  ** why are you people even comparing immigrant and refugees , and why is merkel addressing worries about a rising number of refugees with talk about enriching immigrants ?!? 
  ** * to the people complaining about an increasing number of refugees : you 're just assholes . 
  * to the people who complain about an increasing number of immigrants : [ the percentage of immigrants among the general population has been roughly the same since over 20 years , and has already been higher in the 90s . 
   when a us gunship mows down a bunch of civilians because they tough they were at the wrong place at the wrong time . 
  whose mistake is that ? 
  the us 's ? 
  it 's not like anybody * especially on reddit * is denying other country 's warcrimes . 
  how do american warcrimes make russia look better here ? 
  let 's also not forget that [ ** russia actually faked satellite pictures to blame the ukraine for mh17 ** ] ( https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/forensic_analysis_of_satellite_images_en.pdf ) . 
   the uploader has not made that video available in your country . 
  it 's almost like europe does n't like us ... 
  probably better for everyone ; he might have insulted everyone during the show ... 
  i think that has to do with confirmation bias . 
  i assume that he and his inner circle of friends and family have the same opinion . 
  in a lot of these situations people are baffled about how suddenly other people have a different opinion , when before they had the impression that everyone agreed with them . 
  that 's speculation of course . 
  so if you introduced legislation to capo the raise of rents to 10 % this would lead to slums how ? 
  i live in berlin , and rents ca n't be raised over a certain percentage of the average in each district : does n't solve all problems , but does help a little . 
  you keep making it look like there is no middle ground between skyscrapers and slums . 
  and at the same time you ca n't believe there is no poverty in london . 
  it 's just being pushed outwards . 
  what is your proposition to solve the problem ? 
  last but not least i though the western world had learned that investments with a 20 % return lead to no good , * especially * in real estate . 
  that is direct democracy alright , but i would consider the ability to vote in secret as an important factor in a democracy . 
  so you do n't think anything could go wrong with 100 % direct democracy ? 
  you know us germans had one or the other problems with democratically elected leaders . 
  let 's no forget that that there is a lot of xenophobia in switzerland , and that this system was also used to ban minarets in switzerland . 
  it 's a good system when everyone is well informed , but how many demagogues does it take to misuse it against minorities ? 
  the way he described his decisions seems like he wanted a pat on the back , or some karma for it . 
  yes , and they would vote against public broadcasting . 
  is publishing your filled out ballot legal in switzerland ? 
  well there 's the [ adfc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allgemeiner_deutscher_fahrrad-club ) and also [ berlin 's own critical mass ] ( http://www.critical-mass-berlin.de/ ) , but they 're still growing , and i think the struth is simply that germans love driving their cars too much . 
  there is hardly a day where there is no cyclist being run over by a car turning without minding the cyclist , and as a reaction the ministry of inftrastructure started [ a campaign to get cyclists to wear helmets ] ( http://www.merkur.de/politik/darth-vader-alexander-dobrindt-will-radlfahrer-helmtragen-animieren-star-wars-kampagne-5023276.html ) . 
  i do wear a helmet , but what does a helmet help when you 're get [ run over by a massive truck ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/polizei-justiz/unfall-am-checkpoint-charlie-radlerin-von-laster-schwer-verletzt/11559500.html ) . 
  the only thing that helps me is driving very defensively and always being ready to break , no matter the situation . 
  i could write a diary of almost-incidents with turning cars . 
  why does regulation equal no profit ? 
  why ca n't we just put a limit to maximum profit and greed , by e.g. 
  simply capping the rent increase ? 
  the problem with the crazy people is that they will eventually return being trained and instructed by the is . 
  i also do n't think it 's a great thing that crazy people commit atrocities - regardless if it 's in their country of origin or somewhere else . 
  you 're acting like there are only those two extremes . 
  cycling in london ?!, 
  sure , if you have a deathwish ... as someone who has been to the netherlands numerous times i can warn you : there is hardly any european city outside the netherlands that has bicycle infrastructure that compares . 
  denmark is the only country that comes to my mind . 
  i cycle every day to and from work in berlin ( ~ 45 minutes each ) and since i started doing that regularly , i started carrying my organ donor card with me . 
  sometimes i feel like the one unifying european idea is the dislike of sinti & roma . 
   reddit 's majority hates the police but you are generalizing thousands of policemen . 
  even in this very thread people claim the guy who was beaten was no saint , should 've avoided the situation , etc. 
  i think it 's safe to assume that for every guy who hates cops and insults them on here is a guy who loves cops and defends them . 
   my argument should simply being that should the guy not have an argument with police why ? 
  do you think one is generally not allowed to question the police ? 
   the incident could be avoided yes , if all citizens stay at home , pay their taxes and obey the law everything will be okay . 
   also what is strange , you can see clearly after guy was hit and put to the ground , the police officer is putting his weapon away , so why the guy gets beaten up after that ? 
  i do n't think i 'm quite following you here . 
  you 're jumping to conclusions now . 
  i have been to several demonstrations ( not to live soccer games though , i only ever watch soccer on tv ) , but am not going anymore , since i have two kids , and any consequences would not only involve me , but my kids as well . 
  do n't underestimate technolgy !,

  and now you play ye olde trump card . 
  a job well done !, 
  oh , i see reddit 's detectives have arrived to assess the situation . 
  let us sprinkle some crack over the beaten guy , and call it a day . 
  no personally i would n't appear at a soccer game , a demonstration or any other kind of public event with riot police involved because these things happen time and time again . 
  i just wonder why the victim 's intelligence here is questioned . 
  you claim to know him personally ? 
  also : so whether you deserve a beating or not depends on you beaing a `` saint '' or not ? 
  so someone with a criminal record could be beaten even if there 's no immediate reason ? 
  are you quoting [ medival law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vogelfrei ) ? 
  fair enough . 
  i think it would still be good if you added that to your post . 
  there are enough people who will claim that 's made-up leftist propaganda . 
  would you question the other guys ( from ~ 0:39 ) intelligence as well had they beaten him ? 
  why is submission to a bully a sign of intelligence ? 
  not trying to protect the police here , but source ? 
  continue ... 
   it was with the consent of the german government . 
  i highly doubt the german government was asked for consent . 
  it was simply done without asking them .
