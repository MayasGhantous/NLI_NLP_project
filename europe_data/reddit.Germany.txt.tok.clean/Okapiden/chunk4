   but of course stupid germans blame america for everything in their lives they do n't like . 
  they 're brainwashed . 
  you are actually using a eu flag to `` hide '' that you 're from the usa to insult germans here ?!, 
  during my time in a us high-school ( in a bible belt region ) i have not met one single person who thought of me , or other people as nazi . 
  german class was full to the brim , everyone had an idealistic image of germany , and there were quite a few people with german roots as well . 
  plus : history in elementary school ? 
  with the holocaust as a topic ? 
  really ? 
  but how does that make the veterans think less of the germans because of that ? 
  just got ta pump in enough money . 
  [ this entry ] ( www.youtube.com/watch?v=bawnwsyocfu ) supposedly cost 1 million $ . 
  i do n't really care a lot about the german flag , but the belgians got it all wrong !, 
   and they can still move to richer european countries later , after they get some of their papers in order . 
  but afairc you ca n't move to another eu country if you get asylum ; you need to stay put if it 's granted - of course you could just move without being allowed to , but then you would n't try to get asylum anyways . 
  and this from the country that gave the world things like http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/ & rob schneider . 
  no true scotsman would misunderstand `` no true scotsman ... '' that badly !, 
  might be . 
  i definitely never saw any angry khorne-worshippers , or stinking nurglings during my visits !, 
  my brain is more like a full cup of water . 
  if you add a new driplet knowledge , something old drips out again . 
  [ warhammer ] ( http://www.games-workshop.com/resources/catalog/product/600x620/99120201006_warriorsofchaosnew01.jpg ) took up a lot of space during my late teens . 
  maybe it 's not the most beautiful village , but i found the little village on the le mont-saint-michel the most astonishing !, 
  why are those cities built on chaos stars ? 
  i 'm so tired of reading this as a reply from people who obviously do n't understand it . 
  the problem with german politics is : a majority of our people does n't like to be aggrevated . 
  every time merkel got into an argument with another political party , her public ratings fell significantly . 
  so whenever something negative comes up she ignores it - and the people still like her . 
  this is the same country and party where [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal ) was made possible and people just do n't care . 
  i wonder how politicians can get through with a bad excuse like this , again and again . 
  if you work at a company , and your subordinates screw up , it at least partly your fault because you are the superior , and you are supposed to know . 
  but de mazi\u00e8re says he did n't know about the spying , and clears himself that way ? 
  the same way he claimed he did n't know about the eurohawk-debacle ? 
  i 'm getting the feeling that a troupe of monkeys would perform better as our government . 
  and as a reference for everyone who wants to laugh at our government : our minister of finance once lost a suitcase full of money . 
  he does n't remember where he lost it , and he never opened it to confirm what was in there , and it took a foreign journalist from the netherlands to ask merkel if nominating him is a good idea : www.youtube.com/watch?v=xawe8k2nrvs, 
   american here , did n't merkel denounce the us for spying on her and her european peers a few years ago no , she ignored the whole problem until it was revealed that her own phone was tapped . 
  as a reaction she did nothing . 
  well actually she claimed that everyone has to abide german law on german soil , and the german government asked all embassies to provide a list of employees that are actually intelligence members ( laughable !, 
  okay , okay , it waz uz germanz !, 
  we tried our new zubmarines wiz ze broomztick-armament !, 
  what about employees ? 
  or everyone else who does n't export stuff into the us ? 
  buy money , and pay with democracy ? 
  what could go wrong ? 
   the winners will be germany and the largest us companies . 
  no , the winners will be large german corporations , and nobody else . 
  i can hardly fathom why anyone would think introducing secret arbitral court where companies sue countries would be a good idea . 
  as a german i opposed this , and i also want to add that germany is one of the european countries where the resistance against ttip within the population is the largest ( yet ) . 
   if you scroll down any win or osx discussion there 's always this one guy who 's like ` linux beats them all ' . 
  yeah keep waiting for that guy . 
  or oranges !, 
  [ you gave up !, 
  maps can be found with a few clicks , but all other information can be found with a few clicks as well : wikipedia.org a better example could be a calculator . 
  why learn to multiply if you can use a calculator ? 
  the `` interesting '' part comes when it 's `` useful '' ? 
  useful for whom ? 
  you ? 
  them ? 
  so you would say geography needs to be based on things that are interesting , while all other subjects remain untouched ? 
  you do n't think education is a thing that needs to be looked at in it 's entirety ? 
   why math ? 
  when was the last time the butcher needed trigonometry . 
   do you demand of me to make up examples that oppose my argument ? 
  i just think it would be nice if you would regard my arguments and examples before making up new once that fit your case better . 
   yes , you would . 
  and it 's great that the student managed to come to that conclusion . 
  a +  sarcasm is the lowest form of wit . 
  why are you cherry-picking your examples ? 
  in regards to your example : what if that river is directly connected to the wealth to the country ? 
  you do n't need to know what it 's called then ? 
  so why should we teach anything at all ? 
  let people learn about the stuff they need in their daily lives . 
  why math ? 
  when was the last time the butcher needed trigonometry . 
  why do i care about the stories in national geographic ? 
  you say stories  facts . 
  why should i care about the stories ? 
  and my stance is that you underestimate it . 
  my stance is based on things as  general knowledge is an important component of [ crystallized intelligence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence ) and is strongly associated with [ general intelligence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g_factor_ ( psychometrics \\ ) ) , and with [ openness to experience . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/openness_to_experience ) [ \\ [ 2 \\ ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_knowledge#cite_note-2 ) , etc. . . also i 'm not sure that `` culture '' values everything correctly , e.g. 
  reality tv is valued differently from quantum mechanics . 
  i 'm not sure that we should prioritize on what 's popular . 
  yes . 
  or what is your stance on general knowledge ? 
  also : i quickly edited , but you wrote your answer before , so here is my edit :  but you do realize that necessary and unnecessary vastly depend on your standpoint ? 
  never disregard an argument because one little thing bothers you . 
  but you do realize that necessary and unnecessary vastly depend on your standpoint ? 
   words are pointless if you do n't know what they stand for . 
  learning what they stand does not mean that you wo n't know the names of it . 
  actually words have more power than you think . 
  ask a linguist . 
  and if you perceive something you have no words for you it will be equally problematic . 
  look at small children or people who have suffered from strokes . 
  you will be able to literally perceive their frustration . 
  and i would also argue that you have would learn how to spell and how to write before you go further . 
   if the neighbors of the country are important for it you should be taught that , but teaching the names of the neighbors wo n't teach why they are important . 
  i 'm sorry , but this is such nonsense . 
  i 'm not trying to insult you , but if i understand you you thing [ general knowledge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_knowledge ) is unnecessary ? 
  [ human interest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_interest_story ) . 
   to learn about how the world functions is more important than to learn about how the world is drawn and named .
