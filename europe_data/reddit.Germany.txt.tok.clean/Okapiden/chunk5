  but do n't you think that we need a common based from which we can do that ? 
  what is the point of looking how fishermen in country xyz live their daily lives if you do n't know where this country is , what it 's neighbors are , what the major cities are , etc. . . ? 
  you know i learned ** a lot ** of history through the encyclopedias in age of empires 2 and civilization . 
  but neither am i sure that is a sound base , nor am i sure that that is everyone 's cup of tea . 
  do you seriously think the national geographic is a substitute for geography class ? 
  i honestly think the national geographic society would cry at a suggestion like this . 
  i can see how a lot of school subjects can be improved , but to substitute a school subject with human interest is not a good idea . 
  yeah and all that history man . 
  why teach us about the stuff that some people did who died already . 
  it should be about the people who are alive today !, 
  i can agree on that . 
  til ( as a german ) : it 's all russia 's fault . 
  so how does ` bnd helps nsa spy on germans ' make ` nsa spying on everyone ' look better ? 
  last time i checked people in the us have had enough of nsa , ect . 
  spying on their own citizens as well . 
  i know this is a ( sad ) reality , but that does not mean i ( and others ) will stop complaining or protesting against it . 
  edit : you might find ` murica good , guns good , spying good ' works better in other subreddits than / r/europe edit2 : this just came in : edit : http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/tandem-x-bundeswehr-kauft-satelliten-hoehenmodell-a-1030171.html german army wants to buy map data for 475 million $ . 
  map data that the german government already bought once . 
  so you want to the `` proof '' to be in the article , but you ignore the attached sources ? 
  if a military is ever efficient vastly depends on your definition of ` efficient ' . 
  when i mean efficient i do n't mean ' i get enough for my bucks ' , because when i talk about the german military being inefficient i talk about constant bad decisions , i talk about not a single helicopter being fit for duty , i talk about the armament needing a seal of approval before it 's being purchased , but the authority who gave that seal of approval was the company them-self - and surprise : under heat ( e.g. 
  desert ) and fire the hit ratio goes as low as 7 % because the barrel distorts from the heat . 
  this is mismanagement that is not a necessary investment . 
  they built a hall to simulate targets for 16\u00a0000\u00a0000 $ to test new weapons , but the ammunition left residue . 
  to clean that up they spent 1 000 000 $ on brushes made of the ear hair of south american cows ( that is no joke : [ german source ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/steuerverschwendungs-bilanz-so-schlecht-wirtschaftet-der-staat-a-519026.html ) ) to clean that up . 
  but guess what : it did n't work . 
  i refuse to accept this level of mismanagement as acceptable investment into the security and interests of germany . 
  as for germany being taken serious . 
  i 'm pretty sure germany is being taken serious by a lot of countries ; it 's `` just '' the global superpowers ( usa , russia , china ) that tend to look down on anyone else , and only accept strength - and as i said already : if germany spent twice as much on the military we would just end up with twice as many broomsticks - where is the point ? 
  i can give you another example : because of the desolate condition of the german military helicopters they planned to by a bunch of new helicopters for the german navy . 
  guess what happened : those helicopters are not even allowed to fly over difficult terrain , including water . 
  edit : but i really wonder why americans try to tell germany what the military obligations are while at the same time the usa conducts industrial espionage on european armament projects . 
  irony much ? 
  last time i checked germany recognized it 's crimes . 
  what are you referring to ? 
   politicians come and go , but civil servants tend to stay for longer periods of time . 
  that means organizations like the bnd work day in day out , no matter who is at the wheel in berlin , or even if nobody is at the wheel . 
  exactly this . 
  i would n't even be surprised if the director was n't even informed . 
   besides that the functioning of secret services , or at least here in nl , allows little or no information sharing with government politicians . 
  the minister of interior is one of the only persons getting informed of the activities of the aivd , and the mod of the mivd in our case , and only that through a secret commission ( where the organization decides what they share and not ) yes . 
  there 's the `` geheimdienstausschuss '' which is composed of a bunch of politicians from different parties , and it works just as in the netherlands . 
   i 'm saying it 's very likely for a government to have very small overview over the activities of the bnd . 
  it could be that merkel has no idea what the bnd pulls of , and that the us has internally more to say about its activities than the reichs chancelor . 
  uh , it 's bundes chancellor ( kanzler ) - the last few reichskanzler were all nazis , e.g. 
  hitler , goebbels , but other than that : exactly as you say . 
  yeah , well let 's say we spent 0.7 % more . 
  it will be same situation . 
  i would argue that if all the mismanagement never happened nobody would have to run around with broomsticks . 
  on the other hand germany has paid in the past to not participate in e.g. 
  the first gulf war , and i do n't see how a majority of battles that the us have started have benefited anyone 's defense . 
  til, 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  do you think the outrage started because turkey does n't pay , or maybe because turkey says the genocide never happened and then tries to bully other countries and institutions to say the same ? 
  what ? 
  that new development ? 
  i doubt something meaningful will happen . 
  * maybe * she will have the director resign after weeks of nothing happening , but even if he did resign , the structures will still stay the same . 
  so basically when she says that she does n't mean : `` we will make them obey the law '' , she says `` it 's lawful '' . 
  i know it 's terrible , but i would rather have an incompetent army with less money , and spend that money on e.g. 
  education than have an incompetent army that blows even more money . 
  it 's sad , really . 
   but i mean , how can the grandkids of the victim justify blaming the offspring of the cullprit ? 
  not the offspring is being blamed , the state/country is being blamed . 
  and modern turkey has officially stated that they are the legal successor to the ottoman empire . 
  and because of this they me be liable to pay reparations , etc. . . 
   what 's the use of hiding your people 's moments in history . 
  if you do n't recognize it , you do n't have to pay reparation . 
  yeah , greece loves germany , right !, 
  if , by chance , you stumble across that list online , i would fucking love to read it !, 
   but why do you have to say `` lunatics on the left '' ? 
  because his whole party ( not himself ) acts really weird from time to time . 
  widespread antisemitism , a whole bunch of conspiritards , weird solidarization with communist regimes and weird acceptance of russian politics regarding ukraine . 
  every year i think * i might vote them this time * , but then do some weird and erratic shit again . 
  actually afairc the majority of the gold has already been returned to germany . 
  but the trojan horse example is a good one . 
  there are obvious nsa spying facilities on german soil , and at the same time merkel says `` es gilt deutsches recht auf deutschem boden '' ( on german soil , german law applies ) . 
  i dunno , merkel keeps saying that german law applies on everything going on on german soil . 
  that is not even the worst of our intelligence agencies . 
  there is also the  verfassungsschutz who pay moles to snitch on certain groups ( e.g. 
  nazi groups ) . 
  so they pay them for that , but every so often it turns out these people commit real crimes , or are even involved into one of the biggest scandals in the last few years ( nsu ) which included murder of immigrants . 
  who the fuck is  they ? 
  the politicians ? 
  yes they are shifting away the blame , but they did n't act on the us spying on the general german population either . 
  not even the spying on our own chancellor led to any consequences . 
  no , i think you 're mixing something up : the general public in germany does not give a fuck at all . 
  you install cameras in their rooms like in 1984 , videotape them 24/7 , and they wo n't complain about it , because they will claim they have nothing to hide . 
  the people who say the us is evil incarnate are the same people who are infuriated by the way bnd acted . 
  german media is full of this as well , but as i said : the majority does n't care . 
  our broomstick army is ** not underfinanced ** . 
  there is serious mismanagement going on in the german army , and ** no amount of money is going to change it ** into what it should be , ** ever ** . 
  they spent fucktons of money on all kinds of shit , e.g. 
  trying to develop a hovercraft for years , actually paying a used-car-salesman 2 million $ to develop one , producing their own sun-loation instead of fucking buying it , plus this billion $ grave called eurohawk . 
  then only a few weeks ago we hear that ** the standard rifle is unfit for duty ** in the desert because it gets too hot , and surprise : the company that developed it was the one that tested it and gave the okay to buy it . 
  ** wtf ? 
  ** i know that germany has to play a certain part in the defense of europe and the nato and that we ca n't rest on our allies to do that for us , but the german military is not underfinanced , and i oppose ** any ** motion to give it more money to burn away , but that 's what 's going to happen anyways . 
  they burn the money , and when the public sees the desolate state of the army , they request more money . 
  that is not how this should work !, 
   but being a cunt is not a substitute for an argument that 's what i tried to tell you .
