   the less so , if you are clearly in the wrong : http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/extensive  `` unauthorized use '' was mentioned ** once ** in the article . 
  and you say the article covered use of photos in spain extensively . 
  extensively means a * lot * not a * little * . 
   `` using '' a picture implies form your standpoint that might be true . 
  but implying means  to express ( something ) in an indirect way : to suggest ( something ) without saying or showing it plainly [ \\ ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imply\\ ) ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imply ) and would n't you think a ** law ** should explicity name what it refers to instead of * implying * it ? 
  where comes this blind trust in your state from ? 
  would n't you think as germans we have learned not to let state authority act without checking up on it once in a while ? 
  edit : link fail, 
   police tell a photograph er to stop shooting photos  they were forbidding him to use the photos he was taking right . 
  why were they even talking to him , if he is n't allowed to ~ ~ take ~ ~ use the photos anyways ? 
  as i replied to you somewhere else : this  you are generally not allowed to use pictures of policemen in germany ** is wrong ** : [ \\ ( bverwg 6 c 12.11 -- urteil vom 28 . 
   actually , it is not . 
  actually it is . 
  ^ ^ why ^ ^ bother ^ ^ with ^ ^ arguments ^ ^ ? 
   which the article talks about extensively in regards to spain . 
   extensively if you do n't know what that word means , do n't use it . 
   again : taking a picture is different from using a picture . 
  if you do n't define what `` use '' means , then you are de facto forbidding making photos . 
   entirely different matter from not being allowed to use the picture as both the title and the article talk about so you read the article . 
  why did you ignore the fact that `` unauthorized use '' is not defined . 
  because guess what : this enables prosecution to interpret in any way they see fit . 
  so it could literally be anything from selling it , using it in a newspaper , or simply looking at it . 
   all i am arguing is we can not accept everyone we must at some point say enough . 
  this is what i ca n't wrap my mind around . 
  there is a certain number of refugees x which is too much , no matter if they are in fact refugees ( as opposed to people who are `` just '' trying to immigrate to have a better life ) ? 
  you think as a german i do not accept costs of reparation post wwi and wwii ? 
  and then you call * me * ignorant ? 
  just for the record : that kind of behavior led to wwii ... 
   if we recognized territorial claims from 1415 , then i guess sizeable portions of france should be given to the english monarch . 
  as a german ... no let 's not start this ... 
  spain gave away gibraltar to britain officially . 
  now spain wants it back . 
  that 's just not how a deal works . 
  spain good . 
  britain bad . 
  better ? 
  the question is : why is the australian population so worried about taking to many refugees ? 
  i would think that is xenophobia which is fueled by your political parties as means to distract you from real issues . 
  australia takes 1 refugee for every 1000 australians ( 69th place ) and took a total of 29,996 ( 49th place ) http://www.factsfightback.org.au/does-australia-take-the-most-refugees-check-the-facts/ i would think with these numbers everybody should worry about getting refugees to safety and worry about a supposed overpopulation later . 
  i 'm glad that europe has a working human rights court that forbids to treat refugees this way . 
  so what ? 
  reasoning in both cases is bullshit . 
  spain officially gave britain gibraltar . 
  the answer to what ? 
  the thing that bugs me is that australia is taken as example as a successful policy on refugees , when there are still boats coming , and the australian public is just being lied to . 
  if you ( you as in `` you australians '' ) say `` i do n't give a fuck about refugees . 
  let them all drown . '', 
  then that 's your opinion , and you 're entitled to your opinion , but do n't act like there are no more refugees coming , and no refugees drowning out there . 
  oops . 
  yeah i found that quickly via mobile . 
  but afairc spiegel online articles translate well via google translate . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10555392/australia-sends-in-its-navy-to-push-asylum-seeker-boats-back-to-indonesia.html and in the meanwhile ask yourself if you really believe there are no more boats coming or if they 're simply denied entry of australian waters . 
  why do you think these missions are kept secret ? 
  why are there no numbers being released ? 
  members of the australian navy have spoken about hundreds of dead bodies floating around the coast . 
  there are thousands of people drowning , but those missions of the navy are all secret . 
  so has spain changed course in the [ ceuta ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceuta ) question yet ? 
  oh the irony , spain ... edit : itt butthurt spaniards, 
  someone else already commented on the incidents you quoted , so i will comment on your question at the bottom : am i more afraid of an actual nuclear attack or an accident / incompetence or an unlucky event . 
  yes , there have been a few huge `` fuck-ups '' regarding the nukes , but they 're not going to fire because someone fucked up . 
  they 're bombs . 
  someone has to ignite them . 
  it 's not nitro-glycerine . 
  and the nukes do n't only protect you from someone else using them on you , they also protect you from conventional war . 
  would russia ever invade europe with those nukes ? 
  nope . 
  never . 
  look at north korea : nobody dares remove the regime there . 
  oh come on . 
  they can bully them alright by raising the gas bill . 
  [ cute . 
  ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/dragoon-ride-103~_v-videowebl.jpg ), 
  infallibility of the pope only works in connections to questions of faith/belief . 
  if he says the sky is pink it not binding in any way , or bending reality . 
  if the vatican 's view was irrelevant why was turkey trying to influence his speech ? 
   my friend 's campaign was about building stuff together , europeans and russians at once , to display our common feels about all this tension . 
  no , `` your friend 's '' campaign is about taking money from europeans without telling them waht it 's for and in return giving them `` rewards '' that hardly worth it . 
  do these people really count ? 
  he could tell them there they found [ a unicorn lair ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9714907/north-korea-archaeologists-report-quite-unbelievable-discovery-of-unicorn-lair.html ) and they would believe it . 
  also : [ democratic socialism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_socialism ) like in czechoslovakia before it got rolled over by soviet tanks . 
  i 'm pretty sure the victims of the war and their relatives would n't give a wooden nickel about your hurt feelings . 
  you claim that speaking the truth is an insult and spreading more hatred between nations ? 
  i would argue that actual war is spreading a tad more hatred between nations . 
  ** people need to stop claiming ` ukraine is bad too , and nobody is aware of it ' . 
  ** everyone is aware of it . 
  it 's just the russian hypocrisy that people are tired of : russia is one of the prime examples of `` countries that act like bullies '' . 
  whenever there was conflict inside russia , be it the [ first ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_chechen_war ) or the [ second ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_chechen_war ) chechen war , be it constant assassinations of journalists and dissidents ( do i even need to compile a list of those ? ), 
  russia ** always ** without exception claims that comments from other nations are not appreciated since these are all ** internal affairs ** , and other countries need to keep their fingers out of russia 's ** internal affairs ** . 
  but ` lo and behold : russia 's neighbors have several of these problems themselves and russia simply invades . 
  how about everyone agrees that you ca n't invade countries where things are happening which we do n't like ? 
  it 's ** internal affairs !, 
  ** edit : simple present, 
  how so ? 
  it 's not like the us 's constant bad choices in giving arms to people is a secret . 
  i would go as far and claim the politicians know about it . 
  it 's just that they chose to ignore it and bullshit their voters . 
  but putin always seems to be intent on looking like a democrat to the outside . 
  it 's really a strange thing , e.g. 
  yesterday he claimed that he was committed to [ minsk ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk_ii ) when he is really shitting on it , and everyone knows that . 
  i can not believe that he really thinks he 's convincing anyone .
