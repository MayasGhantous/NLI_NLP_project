  so basically he is lying , and he knows everyone knows he 's lying . 
  why ? 
  is it to demonstrate that he can do anything and nobody can oppose him directly ? 
  fuck germany and ... hold on ... ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ flair ^ ^ ^ ^ visible ^ ^ ^ ^ ? 
   which brothers ? 
  i 'm starting to get confused over who is in your family and what relation they are . 
  i understand from latvia and estonia that they are incredibly close relatives of yours , perhaps identical triplets ?!, 
  if you travel to one of the scandinavian countries you are greeted with the following queues at the airport : non-eu foreigners , eu residents , scandinavian residents . 
  i think that illustrates who 's best buddies up there pretty well . 
  i remember i was in a plane landing in rome - and we were just about to touch down - when all the sudden everyone is pressed back into their seats from the sudden repulsion coming from the engines going full speed again suddenly . 
  they plane climbed again steeply ( comparable to when a plane starts ) and then turned . 
  it took about 5-10 minutes until the pilot informed us that there was still a plane on the landing strip that obviously should 've been gone already , and they were n't informed of . 
  no , it 's actually [ haploid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jesus_h._christ#facetious_etymology ) . 
  exactly . 
  the global communities always had a lot of power putting pressure on all countries that are united nations security council veto powers or their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s . 
  apart from the fact that georgia had annexed ossetia before the ussr already , i do n't see how that gives russia any reason to intervene . 
  i also do n't understand how giving people a russian passports is a valid strategy here . 
  i 'm sorry to pull a godwin here , but hitler invaded szczecin on the pretext to liberate the german population form the polish oppression . 
  i think we can agree that this kind of behavior is bad . 
  why is russia all the sudden allowed to play police in that region and invade any and all territories as it sees fit . 
  and here 's the deal : europe and `` the west '' in general may not directly intervene in these things ( just as the crushing of the prague spring or the violent suppression of the uprising of 1953 in east germany by the soviet union was ignored ) , and maybe our sanctions are not that harsh and maybe we are forced to act like we agree with the situation as it is , but do n't expect any of us to believe all those pretextual reasons . 
  i can see how we as `` normal '' people want `` real '' and open conflict instead of everyone acting mild . 
  but confrontation is not necessarily the right way ; see cold war , etc. . . 
   we did n't invade georgia , they invaded south ossetia how do you invade parts of your own country ? 
  i mean if georgia invaded south ossetia , then russia invaded chechnya and china invaded tibet . 
  interestingly russia and china will deny this and claim that the inner affairs within their respective borders are not to be meddled with by other countries . 
  oh the irony . 
  usually ? 
  something is wrong here man . 
  first of all this is / r/europe , but you post a top level post complaining about americans . 
  then there 's also op who posted an article . 
  how does that reflect everyone 's opinion ? 
  i bet you read it as much as all the other people who complain about a lack of sanctions on russia in here . 
  there 's numerous painful sanctions in place are n't there ? 
   you americans are really quick on criticizing the whole nation the irony in that part alone ... totally disregarding this is / r/europe by the way ... 
    what is worrying about russia is that it is practically a dictatorship  arguably from wikipedia :  dictatorship is a form of government where political authority is monopolized by a single person or political entity , and exercised through various mechanisms to ensure the entity 's power remains strong . 
   a dictatorship is a type of authoritarianism , in which politicians regulate nearly every aspect of the public and private behavior of normal people . 
  dictatorships and totalitarianism generally employ political propaganda to decrease the influence of proponents of alternative governing systems , as is the nature of nationalism of any governing system . 
  fits pretty well i think . 
   i think you ca n't get on the level that he is by being an idiot . 
  i do n't think irrational implies idiot . 
  yeah they overthrew their government - no reason for other countries to meddle with their interior affairs . 
  last time i checked it seemed really important other countries kept out of russia 's internal affairs ... 
  we as in `` we the protesters '' ? 
  yeah i can see how that works : ignore all oposition unless people get mad and protest . 
  then wait for a minority of violent protesters and discredit all of them . 
  rinse , repeat . 
  did you read it ? 
  well , he still deserves that excuse . 
  showing that 2 year old video totally out of context is bild-level . 
  i did n't feel insulted at all . 
  maybe he just insulted the right people ? 
  can you please stop spreading that message , when you clearly do n't understand what the article says ... ? 
  you have no idea what that article actually says , do you ? 
  what 's funny about it ? 
  he claimed it was faked * before * b\u00f6hmermann made the video , and he still claims it is . 
  [ what was his name again ? 
  what do you mean with `` work out '' ? 
   there 's no real point in really translating this . 
  yeah the point is to understand any of it . 
  yup , but @kaidiekmann will have none of that . 
  keeps retweeting agressive tweets of people who are butthurt . 
  edit : `` people who are butthurt '' of course refers to ( almost ) only people working for bild . 
  agreeing with you 100 %, 
  america eeevil !, 
  rubber bullets are fucking dangerous . 
  german police oppose their usage , or as the leader of the german police union said in 1012 :  \u201e wer gummigeschosse einsetzen will , nimmt bewusst in kauf , dass es zu toten und schwerverletzten kommt . 
  das ist in einer demokratie nicht hinnehmbar . `` ( those who use rubber bullets accept the possibility that death or serious injury can occur . 
  that is unacceptable in a democracy . ), 
  tear gas also has a history of severely injuring people . 
  it 's a gun you ca n't even aim properly . 
  i can see why it makes you angry , but the guy/girl you replied to you just wanted to point out that you ca n't change everything in capitalism . 
  at least not in the form we find `` in the wild '' . 
  this is ** exactly ** the shit politicians in power will use as an excuse to ** a ) ** ignore all arguments that any non-violent protesters were trying to bring forward and ** b ) ** let the police use more force the next time , and it 's only a question of time until the next peaceful protester [ loses their eyesight ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_cannon#safety ) . 
  maybe she ran off with a bigmac without paying ? 
   should i stop voting because my ` individual bargaining power is extremely limited ' and instead aim for an armed revolt ? 
  that 's not what she/he said . 
  she/he just clarified that the individual is not in control . 
  all ships in a row . 
  classic [ battleship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battleship_ ( game \\ ) ) strategy !, 
  til !, 
  115 a  ( 1 ) die feststellung , da\u00df das ** bundesgebiet ** mit waffengewalt angegriffen wird oder ein solcher angriff unmittelbar droht ( verteidigungsfall ) [ ... ] are you maybe referring to article 91 in connection with article 87a ( 4 ) ? 
  the word ` land ' does refer to the individual `` bundesl\u00e4nder '' , not other countries . 
  there is also no mentioning of allies . 
  nope . 
  it was article 5 , but the german constitution clearly states that the bundeswehr only fights to defend germany in case it is attacked . 
  `` verteidigungsfall '' does not mean defense of others , or defense of interests . 
  i 'm not saying that the afghanistan mission is wrong , or should be stopped , but it 's still unconstitutional . 
  so we can keep making up excuses to circumvent out own constitution , or we finally change it . 
  yes i admittedly got aggravated , sorry . 
  but i think that started when i read the insults at the bottom on your comment and thought they were directed at `` normal '' people who criticize the spending and budget of the bundeswehr . 
  i 'm also annoyed by the recent number of americans coming to / r/europe who keep telling us to arm up , so that might be a part of be being aggravated as well . 
  yeah , the 20 million are not that much , they were just the first thing that i found , since i was looking for sources before mentioning that stuff , and i just did n't remember the drones that moment . 
  all in all i would theoretically agree on that `` no more money for armed forces '' is wrong , but i doubt that any secretary of defense is going to solve the internal problems of the bundeswehr in the next i dunno 20 or even 50 years . 
  i also do n't think the blame is on the current secretary either . 
  it 's just like our tax-system . 
  no secretary of finance was ever able to fix it . 
  and that is why i would n't even have a problem with `` no more money for armed forces '' . 
  if we have no operational defense anyways , i would rather not pay anything for it . 
  my compromise would be : fix it first before we spend more money on it .
