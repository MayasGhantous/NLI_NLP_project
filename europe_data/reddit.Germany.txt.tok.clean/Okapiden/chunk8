  you insult those who have a different opinion . 
  i think you 're both on about the same level . 
  and that is the problem with you conservative people : you do n't analyze what you read and put it into context . 
  and then you think everything is solved by buying more weapons . 
  comments sections on any newspaper are full of idiots . 
  do n't read these comments . 
  right now there 's a whole bunch of montagsdemonstranten and putinversteher that are commenting on every single article that has germany/europe and some kind of weapon in it and claim that germany is a warmonger and russia only wants to be loved . 
  these are not the same as green/left people who question senseless spending on behalf of the bundeswehr . 
  the bundeswehr has a history of spending way too much on all kinds of bullshit : * they build a ** daycare where every single spot costs a total of 36000 $ ** which is about twice as much as a normal daycare spot costs . 
  * they have been trying to ** develop hovercrafts for 12 years ** and spend around ** 20 million $ ** on that . 
  they do n't have a single working prototype . 
  * they have spent ** over 20 million $ ** on developing drugstore products like ** lip balm , suncream and sunblocker ** instead of fucking finding existing products and simply buying it . 
  * and after the bundeswehr realized they had hardly and working ** helicopters ** , they are planning on buying 20 ( afairc ) that turn out to have engines that are so weak that they 're ** not permitted to fly over water or be used as medevac . 
  ** at the same time there is so much money missing in e.g. 
  education , science , the social system and people wonder how that can be . 
  and then there come people like you who say we ought to spend more on the military since countries like russia are not intimidated by a bunch of hippies . 
  maybe that is right , and maybe everything countries like russia will ever accept is strength , but ** the bundeswehr has show in the past that they can not be trusted with money , and if you gave all of germany 's gross domestic product to the bundeswehr they would probably spend it all trying to build their own helicarrier and develop their own [ insert random common cheap item ] and then demand more money . 
  why ? 
  there are german troops in afghanistan because ( and i quote the former secretary of defense , peter struck , here )  our security is not only , but also being defended at the hindu kush . 
  do americans really think you stay relevant by constantly going to war ? 
  yeah , why ca n't ireland maintain a strong airforce with jets , helicopters and paratroopers for any kind of emergency , like the 30th of january 1972 ... ? 
   despite a cease-fire order from the army hq , over 100 rounds were fired directly into the fleeing crowds by troops under the command of major ted loden . 
  twelve more were killed , many of them as they attempted to aid the fallen . 
  fourteen others were wounded , 12 by shots from the soldiers and two knocked down by armoured personnel carriers . 
  * maybe * the uk is not the authority to tell ireland to arm up . 
  [ what 's his name ? 
  i think it 's important because personally attacking a single judge is not criticizing the government , even if he is not a part of it . 
  but for argument 's sake let 's assume it is . 
  is referring to a single judges sexual orientation also criticizing the government ? 
  if yes , do you think it 's important to refer to every single judge as ` xyz who is straight/gay/other ' in order to criticize the government ? 
  is it perhaps a vital part of critique itself ? 
  '' * the * government '' \u2122 easier to understand ? 
  neither are judges ` the government 's , nor is writing that one judge is openly gay valid criticism . 
  most countries ( afaik every country in europe ) has signed legislation that permits revoking citizenship if the subject has not acquired another nationality first . 
  usa is one of the handful of notable exceptions . 
  but sweden is none of them . 
  oh , i can play this game all day long . 
  so you would think said girl is now a citizen of the islamic state , and thus would not be [ stateless ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/statelessness ) in case her citizenship was revoked ? 
  edit : just in case you 're missing the point again : i 'm trying to tell you that you 're missing the point . 
  so we 're recognizing the ` islamic state ' as an official state with armed forces now ? 
  i would think they 're a terror organization , but that 's just me . 
   i wonder why would sweden allow that woman to return after she left to become a jihadi bride . 
   as far as i am concerned , if you leave to join a terrorist group that wants to kill me , you may very well stay there when the shit hits the fan . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're familiar with this concept called ` constitutionality ' ... 
  secret ? 
  i insulted you ? 
  scroll up and see for yourself who started the name-calling . 
  how about you explain why you dismiss the numbers that are found in the official police statistics . 
  in summary you have nothing but racist prejudice and hypothetical numbers that you pull from god knows where , while i pointed you straight at the numbers that disproved you . 
  okay , we can leave it at that . 
   figure that fixate so much for comprehension . 
  i mean it 's actually fucking ridiculous . 
  you * yourself * wrote that foreign exchange students , etc. 
  hardly commit crime . 
  the numbers include * all * non-germans , among them fes - if they hardly commit crime , how can the figure `` fixate '' on them . 
  this is * exactly * what you do to dismiss the numbers that contradict your viewpoint . 
  ridiculous . 
   racial and cultural differences the thought alone of only one supposed dominant common culture is ridiculous . 
  it 's 2016 , not 1936 . 
  diversity is the keyword when we talk about culture in germany , even if your pals tried to get rid of that from 1936 on . 
  but really let me thank you for the ` race ' - part . 
  please elaborate : if we could somehow sort and group crime by races ( which we stopped doing here in germany for i dunno ... 
  some reason ) : what dou you reckon would the results be ? 
   not everyone critical of immigration is the new hitler but you 're trying really hard , are n't you ? 
  no , and the funny thing is : you do n't try even know what \u00a7 130 is and you do n't care . 
  existing statistics that contradict your ` facts ' ? 
  of course the data was collected in a wrong way . 
  it should be collected the way you say - and of course it will support your viewpoint , not because there is any * real * reason to assume so , but because ` we all * know * ' . 
  well shit , i bet we could use these statistics to find out how many \u00a7 130-suspects are of dutch descend !, 
  please , enlighten me : how do you plan on differentiating between both when you have raw data ? 
  group and sort by skin color ? 
  mandatory gene tests ? 
  the greatest thing about german passports is that german laws , ( not dutch racists ) decide who gets them . 
  so basically you want to see crime statistics that compare aryans to subhumans ? 
  which translates to ` who are non-german suspects ' , and the the article goes on about how these statistics include * any * non-germans , even tourists & exchange students , so it looks like you have n't got your ` facts ' straight , and non of your sighs and your condescending way is going to change that . 
  nah , it 's just tiring to read the same excuses and same relativization of right-wing crime over and over again . 
  implying nobody had a problem with e.g. 
  raf . 
  and at the same time you question official police statistics - and if we ca n't even agree on the same reality , well where is the point ? 
  i could argue that `` left wing crime '' always includes a lot of `` resisting arrests '' , which you automatically get charged with if you charge a police officer with violence against yourself . 
  at the same time i would not try to to use this single example as means to nullify the whole statistic , but in your case it seems to work well . 
  of course it also works with the lying press as well - one false word in an article , and it 's all lies . 
  by the way : * upset * seems to be just the right word to describe you when hitler involved . 
  as i wrote somewhere else in this thread : ignorance is bliss . 
  it must be an easy , simple life you 're living . 
  you can chase [ this ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-03/fluechtlinge-kriminalitaet-auslaender-polizeiliche-kriminalstatistik/seite-1\\ ) ) through google translate , but it might contradict your `` facts '' , so better downvote me quickly and go on with your circlejerk !, 
   in fact , if you had paid attention in class , you would know that hitler was murdered by himself . 
  are political crimes not a portion of all crime ? 
  and yes - of course he would like to nitpick crime that typically only applies to asylum seekers , including e.g. 
  \u00a7 14 aufenthg ( illegally entering the country ) and exclude crime like tax evasion . 
  well a bomb at a pegida rally - which i had heard nothing about until now - deserves every bit of outrage , but apart from this : no , i would not be outraged if someone had murdered hitler or anyone remotely comparable , but i will be outraged if someone murders someone else . 
  i 'm sorry if this does not fit your `` neutral '' logic . 
   also the categories of ` propaganda ' , ` insult ' and ` rabble-rousing ' make me question the seriousness of these ` offenses ' . 
  oh let me guess , you you would like to see \u00a7 130 gone , but calling you a ` nazi ' would clearly show that i have been indroctrinated by ` the left ' . 
  well we germans have a history of not understanding the children are recourses . 
   guaranteed increase in crime ( at a much higher rate than in the native population ) you know what 's fucking funny : [ this is ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kfzxxpg.jpg ) . 
  the afd requested official crime statistics in saxony-anhalt , and ` lo and behold nazis dominate every category by far with 1749 offences , while non-germans amounted to 15 . 
  and since one of their mottos is ` courage to tell the truth ' ( mut zur wahrheit ) they - of course - did not publish these numbers .
