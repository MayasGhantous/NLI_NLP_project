the same as something bad . 
  like bad news is 3 people getting killed by immigrants and good news is 3 people almost getting killed but were saved by immigrants . 
  they are just non existing examples for good and bad news . 
  / r/europe : something bad happens regarding immigration -  damn muslims ruining muh country something good happens regarding immigration -  damn left wing propaganda, 
  h\u00f6h\u00f6h\u00f6h\u00f6h\u00f6h\u00f6h\u00f6, 
  i enter a thread which is full of america hate . 
  who do i find here ? 
  what a coincidence, 
  how did france achieve such a high unemployment ? 
  2 already, 
  because we have a different opinion than you ? 
  yeah everyone should express their opinion but only if you agree with their opinion or what ? 
  yesterday i saw someone on this subreddit who basically claimed merkel started the war in syria and everything wrong in the middle east is her fault . 
  laughed quite a bit . 
  holy shit thats like ... 20 % of the population of australia ? 
  thats quite a lot, 
  yeah , we all know portugal was an accident, 
  i unfortunately can not take part today , atleast not at 6 pm . 
  i might come at a later rehost . 
  sounds good to me , i think it 's worth a try . 
  i love how realistically this is written . 
  no problem , i am not really relevant yet , but soon ... , 
  ayutthaya is not yet included , but all of you will see the eastern power rise, 
  it 's kinda strange , is n't it ? 
  when there is an article about brexit everyone is suddenly pro-eu and when things like this happen , everyone seems to be an eurosceptic . 
  i find it amazing how you guys always manage to find a way to blame merkel even though the news has absolutely nothing to do with her or germany at all . 
   germany was a rich country before that time ( 1933 ) - that is not true . 
  it is definitely true . 
  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_ ( ppp ) is the list of estimated historical gdps of countries adjusted to purchasing power parity . 
  you can clearly see the massive growth germany is experiencing 1871-1913 . 
  and then , as i said , ww1 kicks in . 
  also , i am not sure where you get the rest of the points from , because i did n't say any of these . 
   if germany was so rich before wwii , how come hitler got to power ? 
  you seem to know nothing about history pre-ww2 at all . 
  have you ever heard of `` world war 1 '' ? 
  germany exceeded the gdp of both britain and france in 1913 due to is extremely fast industrialising in the last 40 years . 
  but after ww1 , the harsh terms imposed by the treaty of versailles made germany go into a huge debt and while the economic situation started to recover , the great depression set in . 
  due to the now rapidly rising interest rates , germany could no longer pay off their debts and the hyperinflation begun and eventually the german economy collapsed . 
  this is when hitler got to power , the extremely high unemployment and inflation made it possible . 
  germany itself still had massive industrial capacities , they could just not use it efficiently due to the crisis . 
  what , germany will suddenly become a completely different country because there are suddenly 1,5 % more people of a different ethnicity ? 
  i believe that is just bullshit . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ euro ^ ^ ^ ^ 2016 ^ ^ ^ ^ qualification, 
  how can you do that , croatia ? 
  i thought we were friends . 
  we even gave you your own little state back in the good old days , the very independent independent state of croatia , and now you do this ? 
  you should unite as `` the united states of no-mountains '', 
  please dont vote for front national purely based on fearing terrorist attacks . 
  they oppose globalisation and have a very protectionist view on the economy , which does not work in current times . 
  they also called putin `` defender of the christian heritage of european civilisation '' while adressing the ukraine conflict and the occupation of crimea . 
  thank you !, 
  what does it say ? 
  yeah its really sad . 
  when theres the news again that a boat of refugees sunk , the comments are in the most cases only `` they shouldnt have come here then '' instead of acknowledging that over a hundred people just died and feeling at least a little bit sympathy . 
  he would probably say something like `` if we would have had the things we had before we left and just had to pay nothing , it would have worked '', 
  well yeah technically but hungary did n't exist in the first world war and austria not in the second so i did not count that . 
  thats what i find fascinating , bulgaria is actually the only country which was allied to us in both world wars and has n't changed sides ( damn italians ) . 
  i think we really are meant to be allies . 
  thank you, 
  does anyone have the save game so i can explore what i missed last session ? 
  i would also want to be a baddie , preferably germany if its possible, 
  ^ ^ ^ partition ^ ^ ^ time, 
  holy shit , ai muscovy not only survived , but also expanded ? 
  if you want it , get your towels on it earlier, 
  in the summer , 90 % of our country is in mallorca anyway so . . 
  oh no please not the bavarians , elect a saarlander or maybe even someone from bremen but please never let the bavarians run something , it will always end in ruins . 
  not a coincidence . 
  let 's restore the hme . 
  hello little deutsch\u00f6sterreich ... wan na buy some family ? 
  i like that you use `` a belgium '' as a measuring unit . 
  we should really introduce that . 
  nonono you 're missing out on the wonderful german word combinations . 
  a bycicle shed would be a laufmaschinenhaus . 
  now , if you want to build such a thing , you would surely need a building permission , a laufmaschinenhausbaugenehmigung . 
  to do that you will need to fill out an application , a laufmaschinenhausbaugenehmigungsantrag . 
  and who will check your application ? 
  yeah i guess the people did not want to use the inventors name `` laufmaschine '' ^ ^ can ^ ^ not ^ ^ think ^ ^ of ^ ^ a ^ ^ reason ^ ^ why , ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ it ^ ^ sound ^ ^ wonderful ? . . 
  german inventions have to stay in germany , you just build too many of them , we had to do something . 
  the bicycle , everyone knows it , yet almost no one knows it was invented by a german . 
  i would like to claim muscovy and see how well i do at conquering the vast steppes and defending my unstable empire . 
  ah , playing the good old thatcher i see . 
  well , you basically are ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ dont ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ ^ me, 
  you know r/europe . 
  step 1 : read title step 2 : enter comment section step 3 : if title contains refugees , blame refugees if step 3 does not apply , blame merkel instead . 
  i dont think so, 
  of course . 
  with all things that come with it like a nice invasion and a march through the arc de triomphe . 
  here 's a leaked picture from the party : [ party hard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qunldes.jpg ), 
  how have you guys even watched it ? 
  did you guys all wake up at 4 in the morning or what did you do ? 
  we may have lost this , but we wont lose the football europe cup, 
  lets restart next week , it just makes more sense to have a bug fixing patch included, 
  we have plattdeutsch though, 
  ostfriesland best friesland , filthy dutch blub blub west pretender friesland is not real friesland, 
  you dont seem like you understood my comment . 
  i even said that it is a nonexistent example . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/tierlautbezeichnungen there are many variatons, 
  german : cat : miau dog : wuff wuff pig : oink oink cow : muh duck : quak quak schaf : m\u00e4h, 
  nah we 're the best, 
   after refusing to rule ma\u010dek advised the people that they should listen to the new government .
