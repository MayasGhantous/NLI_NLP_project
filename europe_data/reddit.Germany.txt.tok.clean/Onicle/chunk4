  russia has never agreed with the dmz and i think sweden would be also ok with it . 
  what could sweden offer for finland ? 
  it would be essentially official agreement for finland defending sweden . 
  finland really has no way of offering defense to big swedish islands of baltic sea . 
  our naval `` force '' is geared of blocking and protecting gulf of finland . 
  internet high five !, 
  imo defense there could consists some light infantry who knows local areas ( what we currently use at border units ( sissi ) ) and then some aa and anti-ship units . 
  i see you posting a lot here and actually like your opinions so i have to ask what do you think about defending ahvenanmaa ? 
  i think it would be fair for you guys also take military service . 
  russia has never accepted it 's demilitarization . 
  they did but they took it back already . 
  second video `` watch the vice news documentary hooligans against salafists : '' and i think i heard this translation there . 
  hooligans accused the reporter being from left press and this was translated to liberal press . 
  why linke presse was translated to the liberal press ? 
  do you honestly believe that they would have left us alone after interim peace in winter war ? 
  i think they are meant to be those ? 
  how honka is related to germany ? 
  i 'm thinking you mean his palace which was built by finnish company honkarakenne, 
  yes , i think somehow he was silently banned from our media , but if you read his blog same shit is going on . 
  why we would be offended by giant-halonen , that was great :d, 
  if i remember correctly in russian they say something about `` swedish party/dinner '' and it means group sex . 
  where do i complain about this ? 
  how the heck we are always alcoholics ? 
  * sips beer *, 
  we won sweden , which is the main point . 
  from state , but it took nearly ten years in the courts to find out the solution, 
  land is rising around this lake , someone claimed this 1m area around the whole lake and said it was his farm ( you can see the area of this farm at 2:24 onwards , marked with black marker ) . 
  in theory this land was no-ones land since all the plots were carefully surveyed some 20-30 years ago . 
  somehow this person got this land and then he tried to sell it back to the people who were living at the lakeside . 
  edit : in the end court decided that everyone had right to buy the land which had risen , they had to pay something like 10 $ to 1000 $ , depending on the area, 
  do n't worry , we have experience with this phenomenon already https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuyfnpy-b_m, 
  yaayyyy , lets see the numbers when it really matters , during winter . 
  quite nice after the first two months . 
  first i felt like i was in prison , but it grows on you . 
  i think it has a huge mentally growth effect on you . 
  met lot of nice people who im still friends with . 
  sometimes nice times in the forrest . 
  i did n't consider estonia eastern europe anymore . 
  so i picked czech republic , slovakia and slovenia . 
  do n't lose your hope yet , anything can happen !, 
  i think we can share this between finland , sweden and estonia : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/estonia_ferry2.jpg ms estonia sank on 28th of september 1994 . 
  this picture was the common sight what the rescue helicopters saw when they came to the scene . 
  empty life rafts . 
  edit : 852 died on the boat . 
  86,1 % of the passengers, 
  lil bro whats wrong with you :( ? 
  sekoitus means mix, 
  it was not a cheap price for the mobile division, 
  finns are pretty good on this as well , however we are so rare species that the occurance is not so well documented . 
  we are not in a recession thanks to euro . 
  we are there since our politicians did n't know how to control the economy without devaluation of the currency . 
  i 'm surprised that you even care about mainland issues . 
  lol . 
  probably 0,0001 % of votes from finlandsvenskar go to them . 
  we have roughly 5 % of swedish speakers and the swedish party got 4,9 % of votes . 
  it 's not a meme . 
  first time it was used a lot in the 80s when both countries had very succesfull economy . 
  from east . 
  master of science , so could be math but in my case its engineering, 
  58sqm with backyard . 
  it was not offered in `` public '' offer , i found out it through my job . 
  it 's still lot of money to pay alone , but i think the value is great . 
  gross income 3937.21 $ ( m. sc . 
  recently graduated ) after taxes & others 2340 $ - rent 894 $ ( furnished apartment , includes tv payment , electricity and heating ) - internet 29,90 $ - phone 15 $ - food 300 $ - student loan 100 $ - insurance 5 $ 995 $ left , which i use going out , traveling and investing . 
  many finns have tendency to pessimism . 
  this is usually the case with economic issues also . 
  the situation with economy is not as good as it used to be , but it 's definately not one of the worst in eu . 
  it 's not just budged deficit what you can look to determine what is good and what is bad . 
  eli5 us economy is really huge . 
  we do n't have problem with people coming here if they work and play by the rules . 
  that 's just false marketing . 
  this problem has been growing for past 7 years and we have had a goverment which has n't acted at all . 
  they let the problem to grow and now we will see the results . 
  could someone translate the main points ? 
  why the fuck we should give development aid when we have problems in our country ? 
  this zealously culture makes me sick . 
  we ca n't rescue the world by just donating money somewhere , it has so start from these crisis countries themselves . 
  otherwise most of the money goes to corruption . 
  i understand that the poor people should be helped but it 's not some sacred cow that we can not reduce at the hard times . 
  we can not think that since our economy has been good for past 20 years that it will be good without doing anything for that . 
  to keep it going well we need measures . 
  we also have same problems that other european countries : lots of old people , unemployment and high labor costs . 
  i fully support that our new government is at least doing something . 
  i knew that we will have high percentage , but i have to say also that i was positively surprised about this high in sweden . 
  in 2020s we will have a dictator who will be very worried about the treatment of ethnic finns in sweden . 
  ah , finally we will eventually reach the form of suur-suomi . 
  if there would be some conflict in the future it would be very easy to destroy . 
  also it would have to be really high not to block russian ports . 
  we had the same exact thing in finland . 
  it was also super realistic when we got our first black kid to school . 
  we chose him to be the `` black peter '' and then he yelled loudly `` kuka pelk\u00e4\u00e4 mustaa miest\u00e4 ? '', 
  which translates to `` who 's afraid of the black man '',

  you are 100 % correct . 
  need to stop writing in fever . 
  `` according to world bank until 1966 finland had bigger gdp than norway . 
  then finland took over norway again in 1986 and this situation lasted until 1990 . '', 
  according to world bank until 1966 finland had bigger gdp until norway took over in the end of 190s to 1990 finland had bigger gdp . 
  really ? 
  i thought norway was the poorest of nordic countries back then .
