so your really going to argue the ussr provided more freedoms to its citizens then the us i just told you that freedom , in and of itself , can not be quantified because every freedom restricts another . 
  hence , it would make no sense for me to claim that * any * place has more freedom than another . 
  the correct way of saying it is that one place has specific freedoms x , y and z , whereas the other has specific freedoms a , b and c. people who only speak about freedom , rather than the specific freedoms they refer to , are using vacuous rhetoric . 
  that being said , i 'm not a fan of the ussr . 
  however , since you had to compare it to the us , i also have to point out that there has never been a country in human history i despise more than that cesspool of immorality and degeneracy . 
  even a kafka-esque labyrinth of human despair would be preferable to the us . 
  saying that `` freedom of association '' and `` freedom of trade '' give rise to capitalism is far too fuzzy . 
  we can imagine many economic systems that allow people to associate and trade with one another but which nevertheless are n't capitalist . 
  not to mention that people were always free to trade what they own . 
  capitalism changed the conditions for how ownership is created , not for trade . 
  for instance , we can imagine a system in which the means of production are n't privately owned , but people can trade the things they do own privately with one another . 
  just like all other economic systems , capitalism requires a specific set of rules . 
   you can just look at the history of socialism/communism , mercantilism , feudalism , etc. 
  to know that people enjoy more freedoms under capitalism than any other economic system . 
  each freedom restricts another . 
  therefore it is always wrong to say that people in one system are more free than people in another system . 
  what people usually mean is that one system contains more of the specific freedoms they want than another . 
  furthermore , your examples are disingenous . 
  there are captialist dictatorships too , you know ? 
  systems of government and economic systems are n't tied to one another . 
   positive and negative rights coincidentally , i just wrote about those things yesterday . 
  you can see the comment [ ** here ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/marchagainsttrump/comments/603yoc/angela_merkel_now_understands_how_the_rest_of_us/df3myal/ ) . 
  the distinction between action and inaction morally irrelevant . 
  inaction does not truly exist . 
  we always do something . 
  what is morally relevant is which foreseeable outcome we pick from all the available ways of moving our bodies . 
  however , even if we ignored bennett 's remarks , negative rights are still very problematic . 
  first of all , how are we supposed to imagine such a right to be truly enjoyed ? 
  at first , we might be tempted to say that one enjoys a negative right to do x when nobody interferes with us when we attempt to do x. 
  suppose a person steals and eats an apple . 
  nobody else was around and he therefore was able to do this without the interference of anybody else . 
  did he enjoy the negative right to eat the apple ? 
  of course not . 
  he was not entitled to that apple . 
  he never had a right to take or eat it in the first place . 
  in order to enjoy a right , more is required than the mere ability to do what a right permits you to do . 
  a right is a justified demand , a guarantee by society that you are entitled to the substance of the right.to enjoy the negative right to not be interfered with when we attempt to do x , the obligation to not interfere must be effectively enforced by some insitution . 
  therefore , negative rights actually * do * require the provision of something , namely all the things that are necessary to guarantee the enjoyment of the negative right in question , such as law enforcement angencies or a defense force that keeps invaders at bay . 
  lastly , each negative right restricts another negative right . 
  two people can not have the right to not be interfered with their usage of a certain piece of land , for example . 
  so even if you disagree with everything i said up until now , we are still back where we started : freedom-talk is vacuous . 
   we just have different definitions of what we mean by freedom , because to you it mean the ability to do anything , and if someone is constrained by nature or circumstances than its not really freedom . 
  but i believe in the liberal conception of freedom , which is the ability to act without government interference . 
  the different concepts you mention are called `` effective freedom '' and `` formal freedom '' . you are formally free to go to canada just in case no law or convention backed by penalties prevents you from going and no one would coercively interfere if you attempted to travel there . 
  in contrast , you are effectively free to go to canada just in case this is an option that you may choose - if you choose to go and seriously try to go , you will get there , and if you do not choose to go and make a serious attempt to go , you do not get there . 
  formal freedom without effective freedom is essentially useless . 
  what does it matter if i am formally free to do something if i am not actually able to do it ? 
  suffering = / = freedom . 
  nice try to move the goalpost . 
  a right to life involves many restrictions , depending on how it is interpreted . 
  it obviously involves a prohibition of all things that pose a direct and immediate threat to somebody 's life . 
  it arguably involes a prohibition of things that do not directly threaten somebody else 's survival , but nevertheless pose a relatively large risk , such as drunk driving , certain kinds of pollution , or gun ownership . 
  if it is interpreted as a positive right to be kept alive , then it obligates others not only to refrain from certain activities , but also to provide certain services to those who could not survive without them . 
  and if this right is considered to be absolute and inalienable , then it even prohibits victims from using potentially lethal force against an attacker . 
  the same is true for all the other rights you mentioned . 
  all forms of rights only have meaning insofar as they impose limits on the freedom of other people ( not just the government ) . 
  i never argued that specific freedoms do n't exist . 
  i argued that each freedom restricts another . 
  that 's why it 's always meaningless rhetoric to talk about freedom per se . 
  to suggest that capitalism is what you get when you increase freedom is a vacuous statement . 
  like every other economic or social order , capitalism is the result of the enforcement of specific rules that provide people with a certain realm of action . 
  some things are allowed , others are n't . 
  there is nothing special about capitalism in this sense . 
  it 's not any more `` free '' than any other economic system people can come up with . 
  the point of contention is always ** which ** set of rights to accept and which to reject . 
  i , for instance , reject many of the ownership rights of today 's capitalist system . 
  for instance , i do n't think that any individual should be able to fully own things that are necessary for the basic sustenance of others . 
  full ownership implies the right to destroy and i do n't think that anybody should be entitled to haphazardly destroy something that others require for the satisfaction of their basic needs . 
  another example is the right to receive an income without ever working for it . 
  other rights that would be part of a purely capitalist system are already restricted by most governments because they are flagrantly harmful , such as the right to privately own natural monopolies . 
  furthermore , most governments restrict full ownership by restricting the right to transfer one 's property to certain entities , such as terrorist organizations ( although people are still allowed to buy american products in my country for some reason ) . 
  we can and have increased the number of human goods by decreasing nature . 
  however , even if we destroyed every pristine part of nature , there would not be enough resources on this planet to allow every single person alive today to have the same profligate lifestyle of wealthy westerners . 
  so , if you want to use this lifestyle as a benchmark for a tolerable country , then this implies that not all countries can be tolerable . 
  it 's strange to set a minimum level that is impossible for all to meet . 
  on a side note , i find it quite curious that you and your ilk measure `` standard of living '' only by looking at wealth . 
  perhaps a life in a just country is more satisfying than life in an unjust country , even if the former is poorer than the latter . 
  if only finances , rather than justice , matters for the success you speak of , then these looters and marauders were very successful . 
  the same is true for kings , emperors , other nobility and the land owners under feudalism . 
  however , if justice does matter , then capitalist exploiters are n't sucessful either . 
  the profligate lifestyle you seem to value so highly is only possible by imposing poverty onto others , because there are n't enough resources on this planet to allow everybody to live like that . 
  the tragedy of scarcity is that scarcity tends to make each one 's gain someone else 's loss . 
  one can act for oneself only by acting against others , since there is not enough for all . 
  that 's why i do n't think that this `` standard of living '' should be the benchmark for a country to be tolerable . 
  otherwise , it would be impossible for all countries to be tolerable . 
  in any event , today 's dominance of capitalism could be linked to what started this conversation in the first place : any competing systems is fought , sabotaged and destroyed by the established power . 
  it depends . 
  is a `` sucessful '' country a just country , or are you merely talking about loot ? 
  if so , then there were many conquerors and marauding bands that were quite successful throughout history . 
   more freedom lol freedom , per se , is n't quantifiable , honey . 
  in fact , every freedom restricts another . 
   dictatorships   anarcho-capitalists it 's quite telling that you 're perfectly willing to tolerate a system under which human beings are marketable goods ; a system that allows for the enslavement of children , torture and ecocidal behavior . 
  yet , americans act bewildered when i tell them that they lack a moral sense . 
  you are addressing things i have n't even alluded to it in the slightest . 
  pointing out that rules are restrictive is not nhilistic , it 's common sense . 
  all rights imply restrictions . 
  the point of a right , after all , is to restrain the actions of others so as to give the right-holder a specific realm of action . 
  since one freedom always restricts another , it 's pointless to talk about freedom per se . 
  that does n't mean that there is no right or wrong , or that there is no morality . 
  i have no clue how anybody could think otherwise .
