  ** relax dude , it 's just a prank . 
  see , there are cameras . 
   the plebe good to see i 'm obviously not part of the plebs , 
  well , although recent history tells a different story i would n't say it 's `` inevitable '' . 
  question : * would you be for or against a military intervention by your native country in the ukraine-russia conflict ? 
  * answer : * against . 
  germany fighting russia again would inevitably lead to ww3 and to the end of civilization as we know it . 
  * he was giving his answer to a hypothetical scenario as given by op . 
  or are you saying germany would n't fight russia in any hypothetical scenario ? 
  it depends . 
  right now it looks like the ukrainians are fine . 
  but should shit start to hit the fan , meaning a full war breaking out ( and i currently do n't see that coming ) , the bundeswehr should definitely protect us and our allies . 
  that 's why i just do n't understand why our military is currently in a disastrous state and our government does n't seem to care . 
  i 'm afraid that 's not how space/vacuum works . 
  ** just kidding , we are europeans . 
  we 'll make it happen !,

  yes . 
  no seriously . 
  this is the way mankind should be taking . 
  if you eliminate all things that keeps us separate from each other like religion and borders and `` cultural differences '' , we would have so much time and energy to work on keeping this blue ball a place for future generations . 
  and reach for the stars . 
  the world needs more people like you . 
  show us on the doll where the germans touched you . 
   swilling sausage and drinking beer the butthurt is delicious . 
  listen you pathetic fuckface , nobody is interested in your racist whining . 
  dae forth reich coming ???? 
  * baby , i can not stay with you any longer . 
  i have to go and fight for my country . 
  do n't cry for me and remember , i 'll always be there and watch you from afar . 
  i love you !, 
  * end credits . 
   as for feeling like a superpower , i think that partly explains why the british political class emphasise the importance of the anglo-american alliance and being the us ' number one ally . 
  agree with it or not , they believe britain 's role in the world is projected by allying closely with the us . 
  if this is really the mindset of british politicians , i 'm not sure if i find this hilarious or sad .

  in germany : [ schloss neuschwanstein ] ( http://www.baviere-quebec.org/imperia/md/quebec/tourismus/neuschwanstein_bild.jpeg ) in europe : i like the design of the [ `` walkie talkie '' building in london ( aka the fryscraper ) . 
  ] ( http://www.urban75.org/blog/images/walkie-talkie-fenchurch-st-03.jpg )  during the building 's construction , it was discovered that for a period of up to two hours each day if the sun shines directly onto the building , it acts as a concave mirror and focuses light onto the streets to the south . 
  spot temperature readings including up to 91 \u00b0 c ( 196 \u00b0 f ) and 117 \u00b0 c ( 243 \u00b0 f ) were observed during the summer of 2013 , when the reflection of a beam of light up to six times brighter than direct sunlight shining onto the streets beneath damaged vehicles parked on the street nearby , including one on eastcheap whose owner was paid # 946 by the developers for repairs to melted bodywork .

   the next step is that our fascistic police want access to this data . 
  this .

  muh freedoms of movements !, 
   the problem is that the germans wo n't have to pay . 
  that 's discrimination of other eu citizens . 
  and that 's completely wrong . 
  we will also have to pay the toll , but since we are already paying for our infrastructure with our taxes since forever , and we can not tax non-germans the toll will be set off against our taxes . 
  otherwise germans would be charged twice . 
  fair deal . 
  can confirm . 
  source : i lol 'd, 
  right . 
  get the laboring class back on track . 
  how dare they demand decent pay for their work ? 
  and that 's what unions are for !, 
  crippling them means crippling the interests of the people . 
  fuck.you.angie . 
  and i agree with yours . 
  scotland made the decision to say with the uk so they will have to follow whatever the uk decides to do . 
  it 's not like they did n't have the chance to take their fate into their own hands . 
  i just found it funny to read a sentence like `` no special treatment for scotland '' [ after all the effort to make them stay in the uk . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nevsgeee0w ), 
  and from a eu perspective : i 'd like to stay together with the uk because i do love the uk , but staying together should not be at any price . 
  no more `` let 's stay together '' and `` we love you scotland '' slogans but brutal reality . 
  nice . 
   the war was won ~ ~ because ~ ~ with the help of usa logistics . 
  except for this part i agree with you . 
  oh , but i already did . 
  that 's why i am having a realistic view of the us relevance in germany 's defeat . 
  you know that stuff you do n't learn by watching `` saving private ryan '' . 
  and that makes them the hero that  saved europe twice from the german aggression ? 
  that 's like saying china won the football world-cup because it provided germany their jerseys and shoes . 
   us saved europe twice from the german aggression out of curiosity , do you actually believe that ? 
  are they really teaching you that in school in the us ? 
  i 'm just asking because it 's bullshit , but still i see people bringing it up all the time . 
  over 80 % of hitlers armies died on the russian front . 
  most of his best troops were used trying to invade russia as well as a huge amount of armaments , vehicles and resources . 
  this denied hitler access to crucial oil supplies in the caucuses and forced the germans to use poor quality synthetic oil . 
  it was russian soldiers who smashed through german lines and eventually took berlin . 
  america provided tons of armaments and food supplies to the allies through the lend/lease plan which kept the allies fighting the war . 
  they also joined the war * later * and were an integral part of the liberation of france and the eventual surrender of germany , providing thousands of troops and crucial air support . 
  contrary to hollywood movies the us was part of the allied force , but hardly * the * driving force . 
  russia did the hard work .
