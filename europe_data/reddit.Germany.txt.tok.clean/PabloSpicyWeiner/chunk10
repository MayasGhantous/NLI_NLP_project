  `` arbeit macht frei '' for obvious reasons . 
  nobody here says that though . 
  well , it looks like the uk is about to become a top priority target for nsa surveillance . 
  yeah , this title is bullshit . 
  it even seems to be the good kind of propaganda , seeing that they are holding hands in the end . 
  and what 's the reason you are running with no-script turned on ? 
  html5 is no replacement for javascript . 
  your first comment suggests that , and this is simply wrong . 
  html5 without javascript is just new tags . 
  * html is for content * css is for the look * javascript is for the behavior, 
  [ i 'd put my money on insulted , angry and surprised ] ( http://www.uke.de/kliniken/psychiatrie/images_content/klinik-psychiatrie-psychotherapie/putin.gif ), 
  identify , break up , expel ( if possible ) otherwise monitor . 
  release the hessian shaolin . 
  cool story , bro . 
  the fact that they * might * be from britain is n't relevant . 
  we have to realize and acknowledge that radical islam is here in europe and thriving . 
  this scum could have been from any other country in europe as well . 
  we should ask ourselves if we are doing enough to exterminate these movements * before * the are even able to recruit new fighters here . 
  pointing the finger towards the middle east saying it 's their problem is dangerous and will take its toll in the long run . 
  what ? 
  that 's it ? 
  no preemptive area bombing with napalm ?? 
  i swear to god , this government is fucking useless . 
   sexy why did n't you say that before ? 
  in that case please do contact angela . 
  maybe she can , you know , w\u00f6rk something out . 
  tell that to anders . 
  and vladimir . 
   * on monday 's visit to the latvian capital , riga , chancellor angela merkel sought to reassure baltic leaders nervously watching developments in ukraine . 
  ** merkel said that nato 's defensive pact did not merely exist on paper . 
  **  * speaking about possible strategy changes for september 's nato summit in the uk , ** merkel said the transatlantic alliance would have `` a very much stronger presence '' in its eastern territories than previously . 
  **  * the german chancellor cited military maneuvers in the region as a possible extra step , ** but rejected the possibility of stationing troops in latvia , lithuania and estonia on a long-term basis . 
  ** all quoted from this article . 
  i really do n't understand the complaining in this thread , so i must be missing something . 
  the only thing she did n't approve was a long-term military presence aka . 
  building permanent bases in that region because of this ( [ another article ] ( http://online.wsj.com/articles/merkel-promises-support-for-baltic-states-alarmed-by-russia-1408383489 ) ) :  permanent nato bases in the region , however , as some latvian politicians and intellectuals have called for , would breach agreements between the alliance and russia , she said . 
  besides of being the wrong person to talk to when calling for nato support , of course . 
  no need to debate . 
  like expected you instantly surrendered every time you are confronted with facts . 
  you want to talk about engineering ? 
  talk about that . 
  your faltering argumentation is boring me . 
  i gave you the facts . 
  germany stands way over france in terms of weapons exports as well as mechanical engineering industry worldwide . 
  like it or not , it is like it is . 
  i never said it was . 
  i tried to make that clear by using '' ... and all that '' to underline that i think it 's just an empty phrase . 
  but that 's how the world ( not only the us , but especially asia ) thinks of german products . 
  i 'm constantly laughing my ass off , about it because more than half of your `` made in germany '' das auto-vw was actually made in china . 
  i guess as long as the advertising industry tells you shit like that the longer this myth will live on . 
   muh german sup\u00eariority , muh ubermensch ... you are leagues behind us ...  ** and people say the french are arrogant ... ** the irony here is delicious . 
  [ germany is the worlds third biggest weapons exporter after the us and russia . 
  ] ( http://www.therichest.com/expensive-lifestyle/location/the-top-10-weapon-exporting-countries-in-the-world/ ) now guess who is behind us ? 
  muh facts . 
  and once again germany shows it 's superiority over france . 
  while we clearly shrink ( yeaaah ) , france just stagnates ( booo ) . 
  are you even trying , france ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  if we felt we needed one , we would build it . 
  period . 
  and if we did folks at dcns would probably shit their pants because , well , you know , german engineering and all that . 
  it 's no lack of ability but a lack of demand . 
  and that clearly means we do n't * know * how to build one . 
  because if we knew , we had one , right ? 
  now you are being sarcastic . 
  we could still start selling warships to russia , if things get worse . 
  the number i posted above was n't credit . 
  what i was trying to say was that germany is no financial situation that would allow us to launch our own apollo program either . 
  although i hope that if russia decided to cancel the cooperation with esa it would give them another boost for new projects . 
  a european shuttle program would be nice . 
  well * technically * it is poisoned with alcohol . 
  it 's the dose that makes the poison . 
  cleaning your motor block ? 
  really ? 
  us debt 17,659,430,320,157 $ germany debt 2,222,605,407,078 $ that was just minutes ago . 
  bragging about spending money that neither of us has does n't make much sense , does it ? 
  although one might still say that your financial situation looks much worse right now . 
  no , that 's a wallaby . 
  wahhabi is an enormous hall located in asgard , ruled over by the god odin . 
  but i like wahhabi . 
  i never eat sushi without it . 
  well , i have friends in london . 
  one is german , the other one a kiwi . 
  does this count ? 
  we are [ already number one in contributing to the esa budget ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_space_agency#member_states_and_budget ), 
  not with this attitude . 
  you do . 
  you just have to spend it wisely . 
  unless the klingons get wind of it , of course . 
  as long as we can see the `` no_failure '' message in the lower left corner , we 're good . 
  source : i know a lot about things . 
  the last time russia tested americas will to explore space , the us flag was set up on the moon . 
  so i do n't necessarily count this as bad news . 
  hardly . 
  people * democratically * re-electing a guy like erdogan speaks for itself . 
  turkey in it 's current state is n't ready to join the eu . 
  period .
