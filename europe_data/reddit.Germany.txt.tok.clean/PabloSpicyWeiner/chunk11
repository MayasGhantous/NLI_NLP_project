  in fact it 's just a rather static website , that can be accessed from anywhere . 
  i can see it from germany , too . 
  my comment was just tongue-in-cheek . 
  a canadian using the word `` piefke '' . 
  now i have seen it all . 
  why is this a website ? 
  needs more horses . 
  wow , that 's rough . 
  i imagine hundreds of russian hackers crying themselves to sleep tonight . 
  holy shit , i guess you are right . 
  til i 'm literally hitler . 
  thanks , american anti-defamation league . 
  if by mental help you mean `` lock him up and make sure there is nothing he can use as a weapon '' , i agree . 
  dafuq did i just watch ? 
  was he on drugs or under hypnosis ? 
  and ~ ~ israel ~ ~ america is making sure this does n't get out of hand . 
  thanks , ~ ~ obama ~ ~ american anti-defamation league !, 
  that 's why i put `` experts '' in quotes . 
  who are those `` experts '' to begin with ? 
  because except for the headline and the picture comment , they are never mentioned in the actual article anymore . 
  i 'll take sensationalistic bullshit for 500 , please . 
  remove borscht from premises . 
   ~ ~ germany could have a decent military if they wanted , but the political will is n't there at all . ~ ~ germany does have a decent military , but it 's pretty useless because the people do n't support military actions at all . 
  ftfy in terms of being member/leading a european battle group germany is n't less active than the uk or france . 
  germany is leading 2 battlegroups and is a member of 4 other battlegroups . 
  france leads 3 battlegroups and is a member of 3 other battlegroups . 
  the uk leads 2 battlegroups . 
  meat prices going to drop ? 
  thanks , putin . 
  do n't give them notions ... 
  i agree , looks badass [ but i hate it 's name ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shart ) ^ ^ i ^ ^ know ^ ^ that ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ `` shard '' ^ ^ not ^ ^ `` shart '' ^ ^ and ^ ^ that ^ ^ `` shard '' ^ ^ is ^ ^ an ^ ^ actual ^ ^ word , ^ ^ but ^ ^ still ... 
  [ amsterdam ] ( http://images.theage.com.au/ftage/ffximage/2008/06/30/amsterdam_wideweb__470x334,0.jpg ), 
  you are cheating . 
  if someone really found a reliable way to do that , he would be rather dumb to sell that information for `` only '' # 65,000 . 
  * ouch *, 
  now kiss .

  how desperate do you have to be to shoot yourself in the head ? 
  5 times ? 
  it was a rhetorical question . 
  do n't worry you could n't see shit because this huge alien spaceship was blocking the view .

  tell me more abaut ziz , ja ? 
   forcing his daughter to sell the ridiculous mansion she bought and la ecclestones daughter owns la ? 
  i never thought george lucas would sell it . 
  but then again , he sold star wars ... 
  this is mind blowing . 
  science is awesome . 
  thanks for the reminder . 
  i 'm no expert but would n't ** stop fucking killing people ** improve the humanitarian situation in ukraine ? 
  actually drop the winking . 
  they are not even trying to hide that they are literally prostitutes . 
  embarrassing . 
  uli hoeness could learn a lot from him . 
  that was the perfect tl ; dr, 
  well , one thing i can agree with you on is that the us should pull it 's troops . 
  and germany should show more strength and solidarity also in a military sense . 
  hell , if i had a say , the bundeswehr would already have intensive `` scheduled '' military drills in an allied eastern country . 
  every country has people with different opinions . 
  since we are a democracy all these people have the right to be heard , even if their claims are weird . 
  alice schwarzer ( mentioned in your article ) for example is a hardcore feminist , who also wants to ban headscarves . 
  i bet there are also people like that in sweden . 
  judging a whole country by these people instead of the governments actions is not only dumb but also a little petty-minded , is n't it ? 
   punitive measures now being considered by the eu would hurt german businesses , but ** `` if there is a price to pay then we will pay it , '' ** the chairman , eckhardt cordes , told the business daily handelsblatt . 
  from your second article . 
  also the whole article basically states the opposite of what you were claiming . 
   is germany ( along wiht italy ) a major hassle in dealing with russia ? 
  how ? 
   is mutti merkel still naive/drags her feet ? 
  how ? 
  chill , he was just joking . 
  ^ ^ probably ^ ^ just ^ ^ a ^ ^ little ^ ^ envious ^ ^ of ^ ^ our ^ ^ new ^ ^ bromance ^ ^ , 
   with white people oohhh , a subliminal allegation of racism ? 
  that 's cute . 
  the mh-17 had ** zero ** to do with this , since the deal was halted and the final decision was pending since february already . 
  and without any proof it could very well have been the ukrainian side that shot the plane down . 
  wait , it most likely * were * your fellow countrymen fighting for russia . 
  so kindly fuck off . 
  germany selling europe or merkel being useless ? 
  edit : put up or shut up !, 
  downvoted . 
  i 'm wondering where all those * `` germany selling europe to russia for gas , merkel totally useless , trololol '' * - germany experts are now ... 
  / rekt, 
  not really . 
  [ i think if you can hurdle the language barrier german humor is easy just as good as british humor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm_ftzci0o8 ) . 
  if not better . 
  but the stereotype exists , so there must be some truth in it . 
  at least for non-germans . 
  i have n't seen doctor who , but yeah they are kind of robots/cyborgs . 
   tilh\u00f8riget means more along the lines of belonging to something , like norway tilh\u00f8rer / belongs to scandinavia . 
  i tilh\u00f8rer / belong to norway etc. 
  but that 's basically the second sense . 
  after being anschlussed you belong to whatever anschlussed you . 
  only that it 's a verb and not a adjective . 
  would n't work . 
  daniel lands on his other leg after the kick . 
  but that was already confiscated . 
  a dutch , a german , a pretty girl and a nun are sitting in a train compartment . 
  when the train enters a tunnel the electricity fails and the lights go out . 
  suddenly you can hear a loud smack and when the trains leaves the tunnel the dutch gentleman has a red and swollen cheek .
