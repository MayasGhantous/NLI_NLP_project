   `` ... assaulted the cabin crew with her prosthetic leg .

  wait a minute , they took her prosthetic leg away , and then she * kicked * them with her good leg ? 
  how could she even do that ? 
  was that a zero gravity flight ? 
  `` anschluss '' can be translated in multiple ways : * connection , in the sense of port ( usb-anschluss = usb-port ) -  tilkobling ? 
  * to add something to something else/bigger , often by force ( if you know star trek : the borg are `` anschlussing '' all other species they can find ) -  tilh\u00f8righet ? 
  suprise anschluss is used in the second context . 
  to add something to something else,

  one of my first tv heroes together with bud spencer and terence hill . 
  they are all legends . 
  oh , i too can criticize germany . 
  just not for the same reasons that you are bringing up . 
  in my opinion we are indeed too reluctant with military actions . 
  we should show strength and willingness to face the russian threat . 
  we should set a clear sign that we are standing behind our european brothers . 
  we should send troops and equipment to the eastern states for military `` training '' immediately . 
  and not because we want to lead , but to show solidarity . 
  but we should do that out of conviction and not because the us or any other nation pushes us that way . 
  it 's the same with bullies in school : if you are being pushed in a certain direction you instinctively oppose this , even if you wanted to go that way anyway . 
  being called a coward , a bad leader ( who made us that anyway ? 
  ) , a traitor , really does n't help too . 
  plus the snowden revelations did a ** lot ** of damage to the us reputation lately . 
  we naturally are very wary about everything that comes from your side right now . 
  i do n't think the us really understands how much this damaged our relationship , yet . 
  wolfgang sch\u00e4uble said `` it 's so stupid , you just want to cry '' for a reason . 
  it will never be he same again , or at least not in the near future . 
  and i 'm saying all this as a former supporter of the us . 
  let 's get this fact straight first . 
  it 's not about oil , it 's about gas . 
  the russian pipelines you are referring to are filled with gas . 
  not.oil . 
  you 're welcome . 
  did you know that germany imports around 45 % of their gas from russia ? 
  did you know that countries like finland for example are 100 % dependent on russian gas ? 
  did you know that cancelling the gas supply with russia would harm them more than us ? 
  we do n't even consider this a huge threat right now , we could compensate this . 
   you made references that usa needs to be kept in check to prevent their invasion of europe and compared the country to russia or china do i did n't . 
  you 're making up fictional facts again . 
  why do n't you just quote me , so i do n't have to correct every other sentence ? 
  your interpretation of what i said is almost always wrong . 
  why do n't we talk about french or british weapon exports instead ? 
  why is it germany that  sells out eastern europe would that show too much hypocrisy on your side ? 
  so me saying  i do n't consider russia a bigger threat than the us . 
  means literally the same to you as  you in fact consider the real threat and enemy to be usa more than any country in the world and a bigger threat than russia ok . you know and i know that this is dumb , and it 's not even my native language , but ok , whatevs . 
  i really do n't care too much about that anyway . 
   germany sells out eastern europe with pipeline deals with russia so russia can threaten eastern europe economically even more effectively . 
  ok , you did it , now i literally spilled my drink . 
  honestly i do n't really know how to respond to these accusations properly , except for shaking my head in disbelief . 
  this is like telling a lotr fan that hobbits are n't real . 
  honestly where do you get your facts from ? 
  american media ? 
  sorry , but you are fulfilling every stereotype of an american perfectly . 
  and where did you read that :  you in fact consider the real threat and enemy to be usa more than any country in the world and a bigger threat than russia your words . 
   good thing poland joined quickly enough otherwise germans would be saying the same thing to a russian invasion there as well . 
  how do you know ? 
  it 's pretty obvious by now that you know nothing , i repeat nothing , about germany , the german people and the way we roll . 
   usa has been begging the eu to lead in their back yard unlike the uk we do n't take orders from the us . 
  we are much more skeptical with us `` proof '' especially before starting a war . 
  that was wise in 2003 and is wise now . 
  we need multiple other sources to forge an opinion . 
  if that frustrates the us it 's fully understandable , and a clear sign that this is the right thing to do . 
   compare east germany to west for the real answer this is one fair point . 
  accepted . 
  but this is past . 
  things have changed since then . 
   you just learned spies exist . 
  just wait until you learn germany has spies too you do n't really get it , do you ? 
  it 's not like we do n't know that spies exist . 
  that is totally fine . 
  we believe that when you call someone a friend there are certain rules and things that you just do n't do when you are friends . 
  by stabbing us in the back and breaking these rules the us denounced itself . 
  and not only in germany , in the whole world . 
  being a `` friend '' ( obama likes to tell that a lot ) of the us has no meaning anymore . 
  you are sitting there in your `` but all others are doing it , too '' cloud , but that is wrong . 
  we only started with counter intelligence just the way we did with nations we do n't consider `` friends '' . 
  prove me wrong i dare you . 
   countries like the uk actually have the balls to lead instead oh , come the fuck on . 
  the whole world knows that the uk is nothing more than the us lapdog and their military extension in europe . 
  other than that they can not lead shit . 
   you in fact consider the real threat and enemy to be usa more than any country in the world and a bigger threat than russia who is lying their ass off and invading germany 's neighbor and now you are pulling facts out of your ass again . 
  where did i say that ? 
  that 's not better than war propaganda , and i refuse to discuss fictional facts that you simply made up . 
   you insult me now let 's bring action and reaction back in the right order , shall we ? 
   praising putin , your beloved russia * you * insulted * me * first . 
  i never said anything good about putin or russia . 
  although i * could * have said something like `` at least they are n't pretending to be our friends while spying on us '' , but i did n't .
