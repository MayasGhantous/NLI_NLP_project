  what i said is that i do n't trust any of you and consider both the usa and russia equally as hostile nations . 
  it 's the `` either with or against us '' attitude that makes you literally incapable to understand this concept . 
  i know what i 'm talking about , i know the us mentality quite well since i have been living in your country for quite some time . 
   the whole point of the statement was that the thing keeping the usa from invading germany is usa , not any other country are n't you one smug little desktop warrior ? 
  reality looks different . 
  and in reality russia could rip you apart . 
  like i said it would be the end , but do n't expect optimus prime to come and help . 
  this is not a movie or a computer game . 
   they are strong allies they are allies , bound by contracts . 
  the word `` strong '' has no meaning . 
  the way the us obviously treats it 's allies did have an impact on the people and the government . 
  we now have to act accordingly . 
   sit there praising putin as he annexes his neighbors while worrying about us invading nato yeah , that 's how you build a credible enemy stereotype . 
  war propaganda in full force . 
  murica !, 
  i doubt it . 
  fully agreed . 
  this is the right way . 
  build a strong eu army and cooperate ( or do n't ) with others . 
  that would also not exclude russia if our interests align . 
  but i do n't think the us would like that . 
  so you are saying you could start an invasion in the heart of europe without consequences ? 
  wow , you 're really overestimating your power . 
  better hope your military leaders are n't that delusional . 
  if the us did that , it would be the end . 
  russia ( and a lot of other countries you pissed off ) would not let this chance slip . 
  nope , not going to happen . 
  if russia decided to attack any eastern nato allies , everybody , including germany , has to defend that country as if it was an attack on our own soil . 
  no , russia would n't be * that * dumb . 
  i do n't think that 's a realistic scenario . 
  no i believe in alliances , i just do n't trust the us to be a reliable ally . 
  and invading europe ? 
  oh , please . 
  with russia and china as watchdogs ? 
  nope , i think that would be completely delusional . 
   but having us troops is a deterrent i 'll ask again , a deterrent from what ? 
  but i actually agree with that :  i 'd argue that if the eu is to be militarily independent , a strong and credible germany is part of that . 
  i think the signs are there . 
  even our president recently demanded to get involved more in military actions . 
  they can like whatever they want , but i 'd rather prefer them to be somewhere else as of late . 
  protection of what ? 
  i do n't consider russia a bigger threat than the us . 
  [ military expenditures by country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) . 
  does n't make my point invalid . 
  agreed . 
  the us troops like it way too much here for my taste , too . 
  they are for me , wan na hear one ? 
  [ you 're welcome ] ( https://www.storyarts.org/library/aesops/stories/boy.html ), 
  ... enhanced by photoshop . 
  * see , i told you . 
  holocaust jokes are totally fine . 
  and the usa presenting `` proof '' again . 
  how convenient , is n't it ? 
  sorry , we 've been busy dealing with the other threat to our society that is the nsa . 
  but we 're here now . 
  why did n't you just start without us ? 
  au contraire , my friend . 
  what i do n't have is time to open the eyes of a deluded soul . 
  and frankly , i do n't feel like it , too . 
  it 's called learning from the past . 
  but i honestly expected nothing else from you guys . 
  i mean that 's what a good puppy does , right ? 
  i 'll just quote myself  so unless you have insight in classified information , you can not know . 
  so the best you can do is judge by similar situations in the past . 
  how do you know that ? 
  everybody learned about it only after shit got real in iraq . 
  so unless you have insight in classified information , you can not know . 
  so the best you can do is judge by similar situations in the past . 
  have you heard about the boy that cried wolf ? 
  instead of being `` either with or against us '' with ** both ** russia and the usa , europe should strive to become a independent entity that does n't have to pick a side . 
  i consider both equally hostile , so it 's like choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea anyway . 
  the less we are involved with any of them the better . 
  so you disagree with what / u/gensek was saying by quoting me ? 
  because in this case your answer does n't make much sense . 
  ** or ** , and this is my personal favorite , you disagree with * me * but did n't have the balls to reply directly . 
  in that case i will have to inform you , that i do n't give a single fuck, 
  was there any message you wanted to deliver ? 
  she avoided publicity her whole life , so why would she do that now ? 
  so the dutch wo n't burn her like the witch she obviously is ? 
  / s fuck that . 
  and not living in the country her father is the president of , does n't count as a kind of message ? 
  have you ever seen her on tv ? 
  in fact did you even know putin had a daughter prior to this ? 
  conclusion : she obviously avoids publicity . 
  why would she act differently now especially when the pitchforks are already grinded in the netherlands ? 
  if these are the `` european '' values we are defending and using to differentiate between us and them , i vehemently reject them . 
  i despise them . 
  the age where we just burned the witches without a trial are over . 
  you seem to have a reading or/and comprehension problem :  ... if she would like what her father does , she probably would n't live in the netherlands . 
  yes , you obviously do :  doing what her father does is a huge dick move . 
  she is another person . 
  she can not influence what her father does !, 
  she might actually condemn it . 
  do you understand that ? 
  you can not be made responsible for what another person does just because you are related to him !, 
  as she is putins daughter , i do n't think she would miss * anything * about europe if she lived in russia . 
  she could be a russian paris hilton . 
  instead she has chosen a different live , and probably for a reason . 
  threatening her because of what her father does , is a huge dick move . 
  what if i told you , that if she would like or influence what her father does , she probably would n't live in the netherlands .
