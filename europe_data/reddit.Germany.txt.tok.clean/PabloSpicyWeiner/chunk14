  it 's just a homage to your superior cheese , jeez . 
  being critical of russia and publicly apologizing in russias name for things the russian government officially denies are not quite the same . 
  this takes balls . 
  they are literally risking their lives to deliver that message . 
  merkel is the chancellor of germany . 
  the eu parliament is staffed by politicians of all member states . 
  i do n't see what one has to do with the other ? 
  the map has germany colored in grey meaning it 's `` undecided '' whereas my quoted article clearly says that merkel ( or germany ) is in favor of tougher sanctions . 
  thus the map is bullshit , at least as far as germanys stance is concerned . 
  which part of that was n't clear for you ? 
  can you rephrase that ? 
  i know , and i would rather believe them instead of whatever proof the us has . 
  they simply cried wolf too often in the past . 
  ** new evidence ** ^ presented ^ by ^ the ^ makers ^ of ^ `` weapons ^ of ^ mass ^ destruction '' ^ in ^ iraq . 
  ^ revealing ^ hard-hitting ^ facts ^ based ^ on ^ reliable ^ sources ^ since ^ 2001  i ca n't tell you what the information is based on awww shit . 
  yeah , i think i 'll pass and wait for other sources then . 
  please do n't be * that * kind of american and say `` because holocaust denial '' . 
  that would be so stupid because it pretty much ignores history and in particular german history . 
   in may 1949 , the german grundgesetz , the new constitution , was passed and control of west germany passed officially into german hands . 
  freedom of expression is granted by article 5 , with certain limits : [ 7 ]  * every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech , writing , and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources . 
  freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed . 
  there shall be no censorship . 
  * these rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws , in provisions for the protection of young persons , and in the right to personal honor . 
  * art and scholarship , research , and teaching shall be free . 
  the freedom of teaching shall not release any person from allegiance to the constitution .

  til : if we face a [ kaiju ] ( http://pacificrim.wikia.com/wiki/kaiju ) attack we already have the [ shatterdomes ] ( http://pacificrim.wikia.com/wiki/shatterdome ) to build our [ jaegers ] ( http://pacificrim.wikia.com/wiki/jaeger ) . 
  awesome !, 
  you seem to forget the fact that only a small amount of us did have actual experience with the stasi : people living in the gdr . 
  people like me in the west never had anything to do with the stasi and did n't really care . 
  but i agree that today 's privacy concerns towards the us are * influenced * by that , too . 
  i was just saying that your statement `` germany is afraid of spying in the first place is because of what russia did to them in the past '' simply is n't true . 
  there is much more to that than what the stasi did . 
  it 's mostly because we the people have the power to intervene if we think our privacy is violated by our own government . 
  privacy is a fundamental right that can not be violated . 
  since we can not intervene in the same way with the us ( or any other foreign ) snooping we demand our government protects us . 
  also they just should n't have spied on merkels phone . 
  if this had not happened i 'm positive that our government would n't care too much about the us spying on our people . 
  but when the us crossed this line it became also a personal issue for our politicians . 
  that was one of the dumbest things the nsa could have done . 
  now there will be actions and consequences . 
  like sch\u00e4uble said : `` that is just so stupid , it just makes you want to cry . '', 
  he said that for a reason . 
  in science we trust . 
  we just love watching giant phallus shaped objects floating through the sky . 
  nothing wrong about that . 
  do n't judge . 
   guantanamo was 4 years ago [ it 's still in operation . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guantanamo_bay_detention_camp ) but as i said , i basically agree that historical backgrounds are a stupid reason . 
  the current state of affairs is what matters . 
  too soon ... ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ agree, 
  good . 
  if you 're ill you should not be forced to spend half of your money for medicine that does actually help you . 
  who is talking about history ? 
  the current state of affairs should be sufficient . 
  but russia already * has * it ... too soon ? 
   the guardian is so sick and anti-british , they might as well relocate to brussels -- nigel farange --, 
   the reason germany is afraid of spying in the first place is because of what russia did to them in the past . 
  yeah ... no . 
  flair up , or the word `` we '' does n't have any context . 
  oh , get the fuck lost , will you ? 
  merkel said right after the incident that this ** alone ** should not trigger ** additional ** actions , because that would be an emotional response and not a rational . 
  secondly , before we take on serious actions , we should be damn sure we do n't look like idiots afterwards , if our `` proof '' turns out to be bullshit ( like the iraqi wmd , that did n't exist ) thirdly , the german governement ** is n't ** i repeat , ** is not ** blocking sanctions . 
  [ in fact we are currently pushing for much tougher sanctions ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20140723/germans-back-russia-sanctions-world-cup-in-question ) you should be ashamed of yourself to use this tragedy to attack a nation that is fully on your side . 
  i suggest you direct your anger and frustration in a more useful direction . 
  i 'm sick and tired of people complaining about things that simply are n't true . 
  edit : and the downvote button is no disagree button . 
  funny thing is that by the time you wrote this , they already changed snoo to hold the dutch flag instead of the german making my comment completely pointless . 
   in my mind there is quite a difference between the mistal situation and the uk positition except for the one being a ship and the other `` just '' small equipment and weapons i do n't really see a big difference . 
  both can be used to help the russian separatists and kill people . 
  and that 's the problem right there . 
  the only difference is that the french government never denied it , and did n't attack other nations for doing the same . 
   which title do you think is more accurate ? 
  even with the current title , the uk still looks hypocritical though , does n't it ? 
  the difference between * `` uk ` still exporting arms ' to russia '' * and * `` uk still licensing arms exports to russia '' * is that the second one suggests the uk did not actively sell the weapons , but just allow it . 
  one might say that it was n't the government that actively sold the weapons , but then it was the government that did allow uk companies to sell those weapons . 
  it just a nice rephrasing , does n't change the fact that those companies selling the weapons are still uk companies and the uk government that was so full of disgust about other countries is doing the exact same thing . 
  do n't throw bricks when you live in a glass house . 
   out of interest , it there currently a parliamentary debate in germany about arms sales to russia ? 
  or is this something that german parliamentarians are happy about ? 
  not that i know of . 
  the french deal was in the news yesterday and probably also today . 
  i really do n't know if similar deals between germany and russia are in the pipeline . 
  i would n't rule that out , too . 
   also , are you downvoting me ? 
  and if so , why ? 
  [ no , i did not downvote you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xsmrrlr.png ), 
   they changed it to make the uk not look like a huge hypocrite . 
  ftfy . 
  my sincerest condolences to the dutch people . 
  this day is a sad day for all of us . 
  [ i took the title the bbc originally used . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pe7b1jm.png ) they changed it . 
  why they did it , i do n't know . 
  edit : although i have provided a screenshot as proof the british downvote batallion is still downvoting this ? 
  take a close look at this webpage . 
  now scroll up .
