  now look on this subreddits banner . 
  on the left hand side you can see a little alien holding a flag . 
  that 's right , that 's not your flag !, 
  we are weltmeister , your argument is void . 
  `` this is so sad , it makes you want to cry '' - wolfgang sch\u00e4uble, 
  `` brismark '', 
   the uk sees benefits just like a dog gets a stripped bone as `` benefit '' for catching a ball . 
  i love that analogy . 
  [ your article source is not only shady but the article is also outdated ] ( http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-07-11/berlin-spying-prompted-u-dot-s-dot-offer-too-late-to-sway-merkel ), 
  yeah exactly this kind of bitching and whining . 
  1 ) i am not representing germany just as you are not representing the uk . 
  germany did not call anybody anything ( not officially that is ) . 
  i on the other hand have the right and will call you whatever the fuck i like . 
  2 ) if you think that the uk being us lapdogs restricts them from spying on you , you are even dumber than you appear to be . 
  they already admitted they do . 
  so to keep your kind of language and analogy : if germany `` takes the us dick '' it 's done forcefully and thus should be considered a crime : rape . 
  but then on the other hand the uk is just a slut who takes the dick of a former colony for free while moaning `` thank you '' . 
   it 's a shame your inferiority complex makes you too emotional to see this and your anger fuelled comments just make you come across as stupid . 
  [ / u/red _ zangief in another thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bcmoi/romanias_basescu_slams_eu_for_soft_putin_stance/cj4c9c4 ) . 
  so that 's that . 
   you 're hearing about cameron now though all i hear is bitching and whining though . 
  it 's getting really annoying like some kid that does not get to play with the elder ones . 
  but hey , you can still play catching sticks and getting the ball with the us like a good lapdog . 
  that 's funny because whenever i read something about the `` eu '' it 's basically germany or france ( or poland ) that people are talking about . 
  last time i heard about cameron was when he did n't get the `` no juncker '' cookie he wanted . 
  is always easier to tell others how to drive when you are sitting in the backseat . 
  i hope french justice will track down those responsible and convicts them . 
  even deport them to their respective countries if applicable . 
  there was an outcry , but going to war based on pure emotions , did n't work out so good for us in the past . 
  and what the us government says or not says does n't have much impact on us lately . 
  they have lost so much credibility here in germany that we will take everything they say with [ a lot of skepticism ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dont_believe_you_anchorman.gif ) . 
  they are only interested in themselves and they will lie to us and try to manipulate us to reach their goals . 
  they have already proven that in the past . 
  we need some unbiased and independent analysis . 
  ideally from multiple sources . 
  also flair up , buddy . 
  let 's see what your country is doing . 
  funny thing is that the article you quoted just makes your statement even dumber . 
  from your source :  german chancellor angela merkel said the shooting down of a passenger plane over rebel-held territory in ukraine will ** not on its own ** trigger additional european sanctions against russia . 
  do you understand that this means this incident ** alone ** will not be a reason for tougher sanctions ? 
  do you understand that this does not eliminate future sanctions ? 
  do you understand that merkel acts deliberately based on facts and not emotions and that this is a ** good ** thing ? 
   merkel said the european union 's priority is to enact sanctions that were sketched out at a summit this week read , understand , think . 
  good luck . 
  [ the fuck are you talking about ? 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9bb98d0a-fc7c-11e3-98b8-00144feab7de.html#axzz37pvipuee ) you sound like an ignorant child . 
  yeah , i think we should wait for a more reliable source . 
  i do n't know and i do n't care . 
  in fact i do n't even believe you that they changed the title . 
  they changed it for a reason . 
  and why were you defending the title when / u/trucidator called you out on it for the same reason ? 
  the article itself is titled `` merkel puts off fresh eu russia sanctions , awaits plane probe '' op decided to stay with the title `` merkel says shooting down mh17 in ukraine wont trigger additional eu sanctions against russia '' . 
  what she actually said is that this incident ** on it 's own ** wo n't trigger additional eu sanctions . 
  but this does n't sound so overly dramatic anymore , right op ? 
  better just leave it away . 
  tldr : op is full of shit . 
  shit i really should teach them about pgp and stuff like that . 
  i will be the next f\u00dchrer . 
  those bastards . 
  i recommend to boycott their stinking products like mercedes , porsche , rover ... 
  did you really just compare the current situation with the invasion of poland ? 
   are you really this fucking dumb ? 
  * checks posting history ... * yes . 
   back when the uk ** was ** america 's most important european ally since when did this change ? 
  i 'm afraid , that even * if * the us government would instantly stop all intelligence bullshit on us , it will be too late . 
  the damage is already done . 
  the us government showed us their true colors , and we ( the people ) really , really , really do n't like what we see . 
  you forgot : * someone has to keep an eye on germany . 
  it 's not like they did n't try to take over the world already . 
  twice . 
  actually that was n't too bad . 
  did your mom have a german shepherd around the time of your birth by any chance ? 
  had n't you been crying for help in 1939 , you would be speaking pretty decent german now . 
   after all , the alleged agent recruited by the cia was allegedly spying on german policymaking , not the population thus the drama . 
  had it been the population , our politicians would only be `` deeply concerned '' meaning `` whatevs '' as always . 
   it 's all ours !, 
  our ancestors once conquered those places !, 
  still a better justification to invade a sovereign country than `` they have weapons of mass destruction . 
  and oil . 
  also : muh world trade center . 
  no , not everyone . 
  but in a population of over 300 million people it 's not hard to find scumbags that would do that job . 
  what amazes me even more is that there is obviously no mechanism to control or monitor these actions by the government . 
  this could easily backfire . 
   the cruise liner said no travel alert was issued by german authorities prior to them sailing to israel . 
  after the incident , german authorities issued an alert . 
  hey , better late than never , right guys ? 
  what the fuck is wrong with german authorities lately ? 
  wait , are you hitting on me ? 
  anyway i 'll take that as a compliment , 
  then get out of the kitchen if you ca n't stand the heat . 
   now you can start rebuilding your wehrmacht shitting your pants already ? 
   ** this ** average european that would be me . 
  and i can guarantee that this is factually absolutely 100 % correct . 
  you should see a doctor with that speech impediment . 
  i 'm currently reading it . 
  just ... . wow . 
  so that 's what it looks like when the state becomes the enemy of the people . 
  edit : it seems like the fbi learned from the best : [ the gestapo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gestapo ) . 
  this was all too familiar .
