  but you will never get our cars ... wait . 
  first mah privacy and now mah gold !!, 
  because it is a mix-up of the two actual sayings ? 
  i thought that was just a german phenomenon . 
  til . 
  oh , i 'm not talking about `` friendship '' . 
  germany had to learn it the hard way , but it is now pretty clear that we are n't friends with the us . 
  having said this i do n't even think that there is such a thing as friendship between european nations . 
  but there is partnership and a certain amount of trust . 
  this together with fairly similar views and goals is the reason i would prefer a continued partnership with the us . 
  i 'm afraid i imported this jewel from the states . 
  in germany we have saying with the same sense : scheisst der papst in den wald ? 
  ( does the pope shit in the woods ? ), 
  this comes from mixing the two actual sayings : ist der papst katholisch ? 
  ( is the pope catholic ) and scheisst der b\u00e4r in den wald ( does the bear shit in the woods ? ), 
  hahahahaha !, 
  do you get it ? 
  it 's funny because it 's mixed up !, 
  just let the efficient german humour tank roll over you !, 
  ^ see ^ why ^ i ^ prefer ^ the ^ other ^ one ? 
  just curious : is there any connection between your username and the german town of [ calw ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calw ) ? 
  except they do n't differ too much . 
  otherwise we would n't be economically , socially and military connected to each other the way we currently are . 
  i 'll ask again : who do you think is closer to us that the us ? 
  surprise bailout !, 
  thanks , angela !, 
  they are basically our offsprings . 
  who do you think is closer to europe than the us ? 
  [ football fans in england often consider germany to be their main sporting rivals and care more about this rivalry than those with other nations , such as argentina or scotland .

  ok , makes sense now . 
  cheers !, 
   we 're discussing a team to represent this new eu federal state but , but that 's exactly what i was not suggesting ... or are you referring to the part where i was talking about a theoretical european squad that would dominate the world cup ? 
  not true at all . 
  they can switch to hochdeutsch perfectly . 
  never had any language barriers , and i met quite some swiss . 
  against an all-star european team ? 
  no team in this solar system could defeat them . 
   you forget - your players would be representing england . 
  why ? 
  ... and germany-england ( not going to happen this time , i know . . ), 
  i was thinking about similar global interests . 
  we align more with them than with any other nation/union . 
  is a frog 's ass watertight ? 
  hell , yes . 
  ah ... baseball and handegg .

  did anybody say tea-time ? 
  so we meet again ... '' * seriously , a final between the netherlands and germany would be almost too much to handle for me . 
  i 'm already drooling just thinking about it . 
  use , use , use !, 
  if we can still compete in the world-cup as separate nations , i 'm ok with it . 
  i can not just forget about the lifetime rivalry we have with certain countries . 
  ** i 'm looking at you , netherlands !, 
  ** also a united european squad would dominate the shit out of the world-cup , and would make it boring . 
  first i was like `` switzerland , * what the fuck ? 
  * '' , but then i was like '' [ meow ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jzqcrzhg0f0/uy6eodcxdgi/aaaaaaaapai/wljucpp6iru/s1600/dumb.jpg ) '', 
  i would like to replace us military in europe with a european military force with the same military power . 
  but it would also make sense not to completely separate both armies because of common interests and future joint missions/trainings . 
  so i would say we keep a small amount of us soldiers here while stationing the same amount of european soldiers in the us . 
   they practiced this shit already leopard tank commander crossing the polish border : * calm down , people . 
  the cavalry is here to help you . 
  totally not trying to get danzig back . 
  ^ i ^ ca n't ^ believe ^ this ^ shit ^ actually ^ works !, 
  because of all the things you mentioned , i 'm sure that the uk will not be * forgotten * . 
  regarding it 's * future relevancy * , especially as a single entity in a world of unions , i do n't know . 
  but you 'll never know if you do n't give it a try , right ? 
  i 'm not one of those guys that are trying to tell you what is best for you . 
  you need to find that out for yourselves . 
  and if the majority of the uk is against further integration , i fully support that decision . 
   the global language the language ? 
  really ? 
  because when you use this as an argument to show the uk 's relevancy , it just looks like you have run out of real arguments . 
  it 's not like the whole world ca n't talk english , too . 
  [ who is this tor guy everybody is talking about , and why is n't he already in guantanamo ? 
  so it 's voters like yourself that are the reason why he does the things he does . 
  and that would also be the answer to / u/libdependancyhell 's initial question . 
  in german we have a phrase for that , which would translate into `` dancing on two balls '' . 
  he is trying to fulfill 2 opposite demands at the same time . 
  that 's impossible and makes him look like , what you said , fool . 
  he would be better off to pick a side and defend his position with arguments against the eurosceptics , and not try to impress them with weird demands on the eu . 
  i guess he is trying to impress the eurosceptic voters ? 
   german redditors [ ... ] swear up and down that germany was in every way morally untouchable and would never engage in or help the nsa with surveillance . 
  link me to one comment . 
  * just one * where this was said . 
  i dare you . 
  ** edit : yeah , that 's what i thought . 
  all hat and no cattle . 
  that 's exactly what i was looking for .
