  thanks , mate . 
  only because it was spain . 
  and even then it was support without enthusiasm . 
  best i could do was a small smile quirking at the corner of my mouth . 
  went into the basement for that . 
   no downvotes pls sorry , best i can do is feeling bad while downvoting, 
  so how much does it cost ? 
  yes :(, 
  ranked behind germany and france in which areas ? 
  because when it comes to military power it is far above both nations . 
  [ damn you , ronaldo . 
  you 're ruining the portugese football for others ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zawyhcakcbm/ufjfbeqal_i/aaaaaaaadd4/vv4qaeyk0h8/s1600/cristiano-ronaldo-jews.gif ), 
  netherlands , you are of genius !! 1 !, 
  evil but cunning , i like you . 
  dear tony , just present some `` evidence '' for weapons of mass destruction ( the cia can help you with that ) , and i 'm sure everybody will be happy to jump aboard the war train . 
  worked pretty well the last time . 
  edit : and why do n't you walk the talk and grab a gun yourself this time , you provocative prick . 
  do n't let others shed their blood for your bullshit while you are sitting in your cozy living room . 
  since you euro-pussies are too scared to nominate germany , i 'll do it myself . 
  might put an end to our misery . 
  and if that 's against the rules , i 'll say turkey . 
  because erdogan and cyprus . 
  wow , thanks , bro !, 
  i will . . and since my brother in law is italian i will root for them . 
  but secretly i will sing `` let 's go england '' because , when it comes to football , fuck italy , man . 
  implying germany even cares what a wacko like biden has to say , which is not the case . 
  this is n't even in the news , whereas a japanese architect getting some price for whatever is . 
  you are clearly overestimating your relevance .

  now do n't make me summon [ bros ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3zby_bros-when-will-i-be-famous_music ) and nobody will get hurt . 
  nope . 
  that song is awesome only for the way that girls says `` what the fuck '' .

  [ well , it 's the one that gave him his career breakthrough ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dj_bobo#1992.e2.80.931996:_career_breakthrough ), 
   i never stood up at 6 in the morning to occupy a sunbed with my towel, 
  i agree on more horrible but definately not better known ( at least in germany ) as `` somebody dance with me '' .

  no , but i have a dutch bike that someone might or might not be missing . 
  * on vacation i do n't look for other germans , i try to avoid them on sight * i can pronounce `` squirrel '' without any problems * i never wear socks with sandals * i do n't really know anything about cars * i do n't like bratwurst ( still love my currywurst though ) * i have no problem waving the german flag * i have never ever invaded a country nor killed someone * i never stood up at 6 in the morning to occupy a sunbed with my towel * i do n't have lederhosen and i think people wearing them look like bavarian rednecks, 
  dude , spray cheese is the shit . 
  where is sean connery ? 
  this could be his time to shine !, 
   2000 pounds he said money , not weight . 
  will do . 
  ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ remove ^ ^ ^ rostbif ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ borscht ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ premises ^ ^ ^ first . 
  right now i 'm inclined to believe that it was just a fake execution . 
  something about this video just did n't feel right . 
  i 'm honestly indecisive about germany this year . 
  ** if ** they survive the preliminaries ( draw against ~ ~ ronaldo ~ ~ portugal ) i expect them to reach the semis-finals . 
  going further would surprise me . 
  i just hope italy will get kicked out before we meet them . 
  they are our nemesis . 
  already back from / r/cyprus . 
  what a beautiful country !, 
  we stayed close to agia napa . 
  the city is packed with partying russians and brits but since i was there with my wife and child we stayed just outside the city . 
  definitely recommended if you are into beach days and party nights . 
  oh , and the sea water is clear like glass . 
  the only other place i saw water like that was on the bahamas . 
  i admit i did n't know much about the illegal turkish occupation and learned a lot about it . 
  8/10 would visit again . 
  dear cyprus thanks for having us . 
  if the uk left the eu before a referendum was held , it might actually be a major boost for the indecisive people in scotland to vote for independence . 
  as an independent nation you can re-apply to become a member again , given that the majority of scots sees their future inside the eu . 
  honestly , from what you mentioned in an earlier post , i would feel just like you if another country would meddle with our national decisions in the same way england seems to blend into scottish matters . 
  ( hope that was actually gaelic ), 
  me too , mate . 
  me too ... :'(, 
  as i said , i do not know anyone here that thinks scottish independence would be dumb . 
  if anything it would just support the european idea `` united in diversity '' to have england and scotland as 2 separate countries in the eu . 
  since the whole discussion is a european matter , i thought that was n't necessary . 
  maybe in the anglosphere but not here on the continent , mate . 
  we support scottish independence . 
  spot-on . 
  their most efficient european ally is naturally puerto rico . 
   except one is seen as good , and one is seen as bad . 
  that 's new to me and i 've seen both . 
  which is seen as the bad one , because i liked both of them . 
  slaughtering redcoats ? 
  close enough .

  probably . 
  but only because their `` most efficient ally '' is currently pissed at them . 
  so alpha !, 
   this thing needs to be thouroughly inspected oh , i bet it currently is . 
  by experts . 
  in multiple countries . 
  even if it 's not real , taking out that guy in the video might not be the worst idea . 
  with a video like that , i bet not many people would complain . 
  thank you for your service !, 
  good for you . 
   i do n't see germany as an enemy .
