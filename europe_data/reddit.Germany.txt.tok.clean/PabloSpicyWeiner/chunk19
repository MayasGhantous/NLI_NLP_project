  however , i do n't see them as a friend either . 
  same applies to me with the us . 
  i just make sure that my personal friendships to us citizens will not be affected by my current aversion for the us government . 
  do yo understand the different meanings of  germany ** is ** the most bitter enemy and  germany ** was ** the most bitter enemy it 's your own language after all . 
   germany is the most bitter enemy the us has ever had in the same post as  us opinion of germany is much higher than the reciprocal . 
  is kinda funny and sad at the same time . 
  in germany noone talks about the us as `` enemy '' . 
  obviously . 
  granted the term `` friend '' has a different meaning in germany and in the us . 
  while a friend in the us could be just someone you know ( e.g. 
  the guy working in the shop where you buy your coffee every morning ) , in germany a friend is someone you can really trust and rely on ... that 's why i said i can not really blame them . 
  just saying because in your post it seems like your are addressing him directly :  so please , continue to spread ... 
  tourism . 
  poland really keeps impressing me lately . 
  what she basically says is that he should behave or [ this was his last french warship for a long time ] ( http://euobserver.com/foreign/124498 ), 
  kfc . 
  k\u00f6ln fried chicken . 
   the only area where danish goals differs radically from german goals are in foreign relations . 
  this is an area where we interestingly enough still follow `` the british model '' of intervention and the aggressive use of military force . 
  oh , i 'm sure if ww2 would n't have been such a failure , germany would be on the same train , too . 
  you do realize you are talking to the wrong guy , right ? 
  / u/libdependancyhell just quoted / u/whatdayistacotuesday 's bullshit . 
   asshole and provoking [ whatdayistacotuesday right now ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2007/01/12/bushtears__2__wideweb__470x350,0.jpg ), 
  i 'm guessing between 10 and 16 and you have solid cod experience . 
  thus the profound knowledge about germany . 
   germany is equally a backstabber . 
  seriously , how old are you ? 
  you are talking like a 12 year old . 
  since you decided to tap the mobile phone of the leader of an allegedly friendly nation . 
  this is the definition backstabbing , and that was the straw that broke the camels back . 
  deal with it . 
  oh , cry me a fucking river . 
  it 's really cute how you try to make the us look like the victim here . 
  you started all this . 
  i 'm not even getting into a discussion about german downvoting behavior with you . 
   with the courage to leak documents you sound like you actually approve the snowden leaks . 
  why are you so mad that germany decided to use these information then ? 
  i mean what did you expect ? 
  if germany would not draw any lesson from these leaks , that would be incredibly dumb , would n't it ? 
   why does n't germany just release every intelligence document it has , then it would be a fair investigation . 
  not sure if serious ... 
  as far as i can see you are the ones complaining about how evil all these investigations are . 
  as i said , open whatever you want . 
  i bet germany 's investigations will give them much more insights than whatever the us would reveal if it started to investigate . 
  that would also explain the constant whining . 
  you can open all you want if you feel it 's justified . 
  just stop whining when other countries follow their legal principles . 
   following the news of the german probe , obama 's deputy national security adviser , ben rhodes , said the u.s. believes direct dialogue between the two countries rather than an investigation is the best way to address germany 's concerns . 
  did he seriously suggest the chief federal prosecutor should drop all crime investigations , and just ask the suspect ? 
  genius . 
   `` the operation of a foreign intelligence service 's secret agents is a criminal offense in germany , '' range told reporters after the decision was announced . 
  `` and that 's not dependent on whether it is the intelligence agency of a friend or of another nation . '', 
  this is the important part . 
  law was broken and this must now be investigated . 
  period . 
  edit : downvoters , care to explain why ? 
  the downvote button is no disagree button , you know . 
  since i was young i was always a supporter of the us . 
  i even lived there for quite some time , and was a strong defender against any criticism towards them . 
  the first time i kinda felt betrayed was in the `` old europe '' bush/rumsfeld era , because we did not buy the alleged `` evidence '' for wmd the us presented , and thus did not help invading iraq ( which later turned out to be right ) . 
  i felt that the us was acting like a defiant child calling us names . 
  this feeling lasted until obama came . 
  in the beginning obama made me feel like my love to the us could be restored , now that those crazy republicans do n't have any power . 
  i was even in florida at the time when obama was elected so i was able to celebrate his win with other happy muricans who also believed in the change he promised . 
  but after some time i realized that obama did not live up to my expectations . 
  yes , he was n't a redneck like bush but he still kinda followed the `` either with or against '' us trend that emerged after 9/11 . 
  like / u/alofat said , although the nsa affair was handled in the worst possible way , it was just the icing on the cake . 
  i see the us in a totally different way now . 
  they are just another power in the game , that should not be trusted just like china , russia or any other world power . 
  there is no friendship between our nations ( or between any other nation , really ) and probably never was . 
  but i do n't blame them for that , maybe it 's just the way this game is played and germany was naive enough to actually think all this talk about being friends was actually meant this way . 
  we need to adapt to this situation now and act accordingly . 
  and as far as i can see this process has already started . 
  tldr : shame on you if you fool me once , shame on me if you fool me twice . 
  shut up , poland . 
  your flag is upside down . 
  / rekt, 
  surprise pool anschluss !, 
  we need more schwimmraum . 
  thanks , ~ ~ obama ~ ~ snowden . 
  i 'm surprised that n. korea is regarded more positively than pakistan or iran . 
  well , congrats ... i guess . 
  you are free to go and leave us continentals alone anytime . 
   yes it 's everybody else 's fault they caved . 
  sure . 
  i never said it 's someone else 's fault . 
  i said that they seem to finally understand that upholding morality in this business would be dumb because it puts you at a disadvantage compared to everyone else . 
  the word '' ** want ** '' implies they do n't do it yet nor did they do it in the past . 
  to me it sounds like they just decided to get rid of some of those moral scruples since everybody else does not seem to give a fuck , too . 
  it 's a huge source for intelligence gathering after all . 
  no irony at all , just a lesson learned . 
   germany is benefiting from the euro because that is n't the end of all things . 
  where does all the benefit go ? 
  do you think that the roads in germany are paved with euro bills , because we do n't know where to put all these euros that are raining on us ? 
  if you think that the german people get any of these benefits , your are delusional . 
  have you ever been to germany lately ? 
  that money goes right back into europe . 
  or is the us going to pay for the next government bailout ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  the us does n't have any money itself , and is on the brink of shutting down it 's own government .
