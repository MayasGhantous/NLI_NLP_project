  serebro are even hotter . 
  and sluttier . 
  [ sonneborn vs. tibor navracsiscs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wwnvlea_nk ), 
   on a bad day , yes . 
   i can not tell a lie ; it was i. 
  who pissed in your cornflakes this morning ? 
  yeah , must have been really * hard * for those poor guys . 
  pixels everywhere !, 
  tl ; dr : boobs . 
  my first thought , too !, 
  that was so perfectly timed , it even looked staged . 
   get it ? 
  [ mfw ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/oh-you.gif ), 
  that 's just stupid , i 'm already shaking with fea ... [ holy fucking shit !, 
  ] ( http://images.wikia.com/pacificrim/images/5/5a/russian-jaeger-cherno-alpha.jpg ), 
  looks like optimus prime and the gang arrived in vilnius . 
  brtish food is really weird . 
  kinda like bad german porn . 
  you initial comment suggests it was germany 's intel that fucked it up while in fact it was the us because they ignored germany 's warnings . 
  the things curveball had to say just happened to suit their plans for invasion . 
  / u/executivemonkey summed it up pretty nicely already :  the germans thought the guy was unreliable , so much so that they nicknamed him `` curveball . '', 
  when the bush administration heard about this guy , they wanted to talk to him . 
  the germans facilitated this meetup , but warned the americans that the guy was full of shit . 
  so german intelligence knew already they had a worthless source and they told the us , but the us insisted to still keep him as an informant because he said what they wanted to hear . 
  how was this a fuck-up on germany 's side ? 
  in fact because we ** knew ** that those `` evidence '' was based on doubtful sources , germany did not blindly follow the us ( like the uk did ) , and was immediately called `` old europe '' ( together with france ) for that . 
  but in the end it turned out we were right . 
  because that would be kind of stupid , would n't it ? 
  still / u / _ nuja suggests just that : faulty german intelligence that lead to the iraq war : * / u/frankeh : * i was under the impression that it was our faulty intelligence that lead to the iraq war * * / u / _ nuja then responded directly with : * it was actually german faulty intelligence , although everyone likes to glaze over that fact . 
  * so there you have it . 
  you just have n't heard about it because somehow `` everyone likes to glaze over that fact '' . 
  this policy will just not work forever . 
  and somewhere deep in sherwood forest you can hear someone playing `` rule britannia '' on the worlds smallest violin . 
  yeah was totally expecting someone to come up and tell us how that was all germany 's fault . 
  protip : if people do n't really buy that try 9/11 . 
  the terrorists lived here . 
  so that must have been germany 's fault , too . 
  wooohoo , let 's shift down a gear , ursula . 
  why do n't we start with planes that can actually fly , and drones that are still working in winter . 
  holy shit !, 
  rt reporting from a russian pov , who would have thought . 
  what 's next ? 
  el pais listing the drawbacks of catalonian independence ? 
  that 's just brain food for the lower primates . 
  helps to keep them in line and their outrage in training . 
  thanks obama !, 
  this . 
  i was kind of confused because i did not see the translation problem op had . 
  the only thing rt did `` wrong '' was not using the literal translation `` pro russian separatist '' but the word `` militia '' . 
  other than that the rt tweet was factually correct . 
  my lyrics were flawless . 
  italy messed it up . 
  * baby do n't hurt me , do n't hurt me no more . 
  you are joking right ? 
  or did you really just say merkel is kissing putins ass ? 
  [ germany was pushing for harder sanctions against russia ] ( http://www.dw.de/germanys-merkel-pushes-for-implementation-of-russia-sanctions/a-17912526 ) , although we knew that it would [ hit our economy bad ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/german-economy-hit-by-us-eu-sanctions-on-russia-a-982075.html ) . 
  she is still leading negotiations , while all others are just watching . 
  where is cameron or hollande ? 
  or ponta for that matter ? 
  so i really hope you are joking . 
  if not , fuck you . 
  honestly , i 'm getting more and more embarrassed every day when i see how impotent and weak my government is . 
  all hat and no cattle . 
   the politicians that are striving to join the eu as soon as possible striving to join eu by kissing russia 's ass . 
  i 'm talking about cheering crowds in serbia on one hand and fighting soldiers in ukraine on the other . 
  can we trade ukraine against serbia ? 
  seems like both would n't mind . 
   it would infuriate them this might even go as far as writing an angry letter . 
  putin will avoid this at all cost . 
  great , now i feel like shit . 
  :( i did n't come here to feel !, 
  thanks for trying out blitzkrieg 2.0 . 
  to buy the full version and unlock great features , please send 2,99 $ to my paypal account . 
  try being anti mainstream in / r/usa or / r/unitedstates . 
  you will get the same reactions there . 
  / r/europe definitely has it 's problems but this is n't one that only exists in here . 
  we have a tradition of breaking polish urinals . 
  in a literal translation into german you would use `` how '' instead of `` what '' . 
  admitted , nobody would say it like that , but i would have made the same mistake . 
  and i will probably make it again in the future . 
  germany relevant !, 
  you are now a moderator of / r/pyongyang, 
  you mean letting vattenfall build these power plants in the first place ? 
  nothing wrong about that . 
  in one line : vattenfall built power plants . 
  germany decided to shut them down in the long term . 
  yes . 
  since they fucked it up , the people in charge should be prosecuted . 
  i 'm all for alternative energy , but i would have thought about ** all ** consequences before making this kind of decision . 
  i hope heads will roll . 
  being responsible for these kind of decisions must result in immediate dismissal and legal investigation . 
  but wait , that would mean we can actually hold politicians responsible for their mistakes . 
  yeah , not going to happen . 
  i hope they can at least come up with a fancy name for this new tax . 
  like `` eco solidarity fee for greedy companies and brainless politicians '', 
  poland = gdr 2.0 - we can into space, 
   2 ; 25 - a steward is cheering the crowd on . 
  what.the.fuck . 
   2:56 serbia 's coach can be seen holding his head between his hands . 
  he probably knows this will have consequences .
