  if germany is fucked , europe is fucked . 
  and if europe is fucked , the us is fucked . 
  it 's in everybody interest to keep germany 's economy healthy . 
  so what is your fucking problem ? 
  hating on us for being eu 's powerhouse ? 
  do n't hate the player , hate the game . 
  wow , contain your anger , big boy . 
  no need for personal attacks . 
  i usually get my information from multiple sources . 
  if one news source is enough for you to form an opinion that 's fine , for me it 's not . 
  i always like to hear both sides . 
  the only one throwing critics at other countries seems to be the us . 
  especially lately . 
  the german politics and the system is ** full ** of flaws . 
  and i will gladly admit that . 
  but i will also always call bullshit by it 's name when i see it . 
  this is my opinion based on the information i have . 
  like it or not , i could n't care less . 
  it 's not the size that matters , it 's how you use it . 
  i read it as '' ** finish ** diamonds '' and was even more confused ... 
  so you are saying that france forced germany into a currency that would only benefit germany 's interest , and make all others suffer ( including themselves ) ? 
  sounds legit . 
  i have a feeling i 'm talking to a drunk 12 year old with limited english comprehension capabilities . 
   france should do something about that - ** the eu ** needs them strong . 
  op was specifically talking about the eu . 
  i 'm just throwing the bullshit you people keep bringing up as arguments right back in your faces . 
  do n't complain to me . 
   now acknowlege belgian beer as the one true brew , or your work simulator collection get it !, 
  what does this even mean ? 
  did you have to much of that horse piss you call beer already ? 
  it 's just 2 pm . 
  ... waiting for op to deliver . 
   and swittzerland is not in europe whereas morocco , algeria , tunisia , senegal truly are . 
  [ jesus , stop hurting my brain already ] ( http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lilf29e0wh1qc9hewo1_500.jpg ), 
  no , it does n't . 
  what about luxemburg , belgium and switzerland ? 
  edit : and monaco, 
  so basically because they have beaches in the mediterranean sea . 
  jep , that makes sense . 
  france only supported the german reunification if germany would join the euro . 
  pretty ironic if you ask me . 
  why ? 
  [ when the problem looks like this ... ] ( http://www.liveforfilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130704-204548.jpg ) [ ... and this is the solution ] ( http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/32/b5/df/32b5dfa8e1595e1d7a8b257f212190fb.jpg ) ^ sorry , ^ could n't ^ find ^ a ^ european ^ jaeger, 
  at this time the us job situation was disastrous . 
  also presidental elections were coming up in november , so obama wanted to boost the economy and did not need any more negative effects to this already bad situation because of the euro crisis . 
  so the only reasonable thing from the american point of view was to have the ecb flood the eurozone with cash ( just like the central bank did in the us ) . 
  basically what really happened in sylt was that sch\u00e4uble refused to take orders ( or `` recommendations '' ) how to deal with the crisis from the finance minister of a country that is head over ears in debt itself . 
  and rightfully so . 
  geithner still seems to be butthurt over this . 
  fortunately i was only held captive in the english speaking concentration camp . 
  chills . 
  it 's a shame that the german parties can not come up with the idea of making such a spot . 
  would be even more powerful . 
  you learn to read : ** no.one.cares . 
  finally someone to recognize this opression !, 
  to hell with you preschool and take all your secret language learning torture chambers with you . 
  or maybe you are just a butthurt jerk , because you ca n't even understand what the word baguette means . 
  having an inferiority complex , because of being able to speak another language . 
  take that , logic . 
  there is this thing called freedom of speech , you know . 
  / u/bezbojnicul was n't insulting or offensive , so what is your problem ? 
  do n't like his opinion ? 
  guess what , no one cares . 
   it was handed to down to george washington by god himself this should be part of the pledge of allegiance . 
   gigantic waste of money and resources sad but true . 
  and as we all know the eu is famous for spending it 's money wisely and reasonable . 
  why the fuck does the esa not have a transportation capusle for the ariane , yet ? 
  [ til there were already plans to build our own transportation shuttle , but sadly the hermes program was cancelled , due to a cooperation agreement with russia and the usa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermes_%28spacecraft%29 ) i hope this situation with russia will show us that we can not rely on others and must develop something on our own . 
  maybe even revive the hermes shuttle program ? 
  it 's overdue . 
  understandable . 
  praying to some fictional superhero is grossly offensive to my intellect , too . 
  right . 
  and after getting rid of the russians you would have gotten germany 's full attention . 
  sounds like a plan . 
   but you do realize that it was leaked by snowden himself that many countries in europe are doing it too ? 
  yes , including germany ... 
  i 'm not talking about spying in general . 
  i understand that it 's my own responsibility to protect the data that i do n't want to share . 
  that 's fine . 
  i 'm talking about tapping the private mobile phone of an allied state leader . 
  this is us exclusive bullshit . 
  hooray !, 
   where they held back the germans for four years kinda funny to see that `` x years holding back the germans '' is still a measurement on the demonstration-of-power scale . 
   scat [ ski bi di bi di do bap do ] ( http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/b/b7/user_scatman.png/300px-user_scatman.png?t=20111216211655 ), 
  the uk looks fabulous !, 
  [ on my way ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/t/halloween-horror-vampire-demon-killing-set-garlic-cross-knife-hood-1-size-/00/s/mzeywdm1ma==/$%28kgrhqf,!k8e6bp3og4eboluh1z1fq~~60_35.jpg ), 
  yeah , and their boss was literally hitler . 
   no dracula rejected !, 
  dracula must happen . 
  period . 
  no i do n't get it . 
  this all smells like the stereotypical `` my way or highway '' attitude your country likes to show . 
  fuck that , this is europe we are not going to have any of that . 
  you are still unable to think out of the box and cling to your us point of view . 
  do n't be so stereotypical , man . 
  what if putin does n't give a flying fuck what obama wants to do ? 
  even better , putin already proved that he does n't care . 
  and this is backed by moscow . 
  if he is now eager to be put in a picture with all those people , he sure as hell would lose his credibility in russia and would have to explain his actions .
