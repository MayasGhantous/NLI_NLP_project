  what if i told you that you could reverse your whole argumentation ? 
  why the fuck do you think it is in putins interest to be on a picture with obama and merkel ? 
  would n't that take a away a lot of credibility back in moscow ? 
  do you think that merkel is going to go there and be pictured with him ? 
  noone said he should . 
  being insulted by someones presence is a totally different point . 
  that is pure arrogance and nothing else . 
  brb . 
  shaving my stache . 
  wow , you 're dumb . 
  period . 
   if you have to ask what commemorating d-day was about then you should lookup d-day . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  i 'm german , we get taught about ww2 very extensively . 
  i 'm pretty confident i know just as much if not more about d-day than you . 
   phallic shaped missiles so that 's what is ? 
  a dick measuring contest ? 
  honestly , please tell me why you are so upset about putins invitation ? 
  is it because you personally do n't like him ? 
  because that would be a much more comprehensible reason than what you told me so far . 
   which is a giant `` fuck you '' to the us and britain . 
  how so ? 
  do they have some banners flipping off the us flag ? 
  if their celebration is a `` fuck you '' to the us , then what is the d-day celebration to them ? 
  honestly , the more you tell me the wilder your argumentation gets . 
   for a good several years now following your argumentation , why were n't those countries `` insulted '' by his presence last year , or the year before that ? 
  putin was trying to undermine the allies that liberated france ? 
  undermine ? 
  how ? 
  can you give an example , because i honestly do n't know what you are talking about . 
  who will be insulted by putins presence ? 
  we like abba and sunrise avenue . 
  can we join ? 
  they did what ? 
  do n't tell me there is no telephone voting anymore . 
  edit : just found it out myself . 
  it is a 50 ' % jury and 50 % televoting . 
  a belgian flag lying on the side .

  [ some analysts believe bin laden himself had security training from the cia ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1670089.stm ) schr\u00f6der is doing business with gazprom and not putin ... again , where are we going with this argumentation ? 
  do n't you see the hypocrisy ? 
  us officials and ceos were doing business with osama bin laden . 
  where are we going with this argumentation ? 
   plus german ceos are meeting with putin in solidarity which is a propaganda coup of the highest order . 
  may i ask what you are talking about ? 
   much more vocal contingent of former chancellors and government officials who have come out almost entirely for putin well , there is gazprom-gerd ( schr\u00f6der ) who openly shows his friendship to putin . 
  but guess what , there is a reason why he is our ** ex ** - chancellor . 
  and since he is not involved in in german politics and acting as a private citizen he is free to friend whoever he wants . 
  i might not like him nor his friends , but i sure as hell will defend his right to friendship whoever he wants . 
  by the way if that 's your argumentation than the same could be said about us ex-officials hating on us and france ( i.e. 
  rumsfeld , rice ... )  the german business lobby trying everything they can to slow down cooperation on sanctions the brits are doing exactly the same . 
  by the way this is the same business lobby that argues in favor of just letting the whole nsa affair slide . 
  so it 's not like they love russia and hate the us . 
  they love doing business which is exactly why they exist . 
   and let 's be honest here , germany started it with their own anti-american circlejerk i suppose by circlejerk you mean being openly disgusted by the way the us seems to treat it 's allies . 
  casually rummaging your nightstand drawers . 
  let me tell you that i personally think that there was n't enough circlejerking about this . 
  now who started the whole backstabbing again ? 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  really ? 
  watching the us media slowly evolving this anti-german circlejerk lately is really starting to get interesting . 
  could it be that the us is up to something ? 
  pro tip : do n't try to push us in the direction you would like us to go . 
  nobody likes to be pushed around and so this even might have the converse effect . 
  ** edit : credit where credit is due , the comments are suprisingly critical with the article and the us in general . 
  most of them even seem to side with germany rather than the us . 
  a huge business segment which others do n't even know exists . 
  but i really like the song , especially the chorus . 
  naturally the fact that she is a hottie also helps . 
  catchy . 
  [ margaret berger ( esc 2013 - norway ) - i feed you my love ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjm-kcomapy ) hands down the best esc song i have ever heard . 
  blocked from my location . 
  but from the title i can see that you obviously like to watch nazi music and have a relevant username . 
  they have a badass anthem . 
  i 'll allow it . 
  you obviously do n't . 
   some gnome  down right rude the irony ... 
   do you think that the us says `` we 'll only care about california and new york 's interests '' ? 
  of course not !, 
  come back with that argumentation when california and new york are accepted as nations in the olympics . 
   trollcon one i 'm totally stealing this . 
  to answer your question let me first explain what exactly the problem is we have with the us . 
  i think there is a simple cultural difference with the term `` friend '' between the us and germany ( and almost all other nations in europe , really ) that i found myself when i was living in the us . 
  so it 's neither your fault nor ours . 
  ** disclaimer : this is my own experience , so do n't downvote if you disagree . 
  ** what could be considered a `` friend '' in the us : could be pretty much everyone you meet frequently . 
  it could be the waitress in you favourite restaurant or your hairdresser or the guy that takes your dogs for a walk . 
  there is no other social interaction necessary to say he or she is your `` friend '' . 
  what could be considered a `` friend '' in germany : someone you can rely on , someone you can share your intimate thoughts with . 
  someone who knows your weaknesses and you trust him not to use it against you . 
  all others are just someone you know . 
  so the big difference is the amount of trust you give those people you call friends . 
  we had this trust towards the us , and it was shattered . 
  even worse , it does n't look like the us feels like they did something wrong . 
  casually rummaging your nightstand drawer ... * #justnsathings * maybe people are right to say `` agencies are spying on each other ... d'oh '' , we just did n't expect this . 
  call us naive but we considered the us a `` friend '' . 
  so to answer your question : we will reconsider our relationship thoroughly and adapt to this new situation . 
  we will take appropriate measures so these things will not happen again . 
  although we will still see you as an ally , we will make sure to not confuse the us term `` friend '' ( obama really likes to use it excessively ) with a real friendship in the german sense anymore , because , well , we really are n't . 
  her soft line approach is embarrassing .
