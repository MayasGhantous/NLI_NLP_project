  but that 's probably just show for the cameras because she got huge pressure by the economic advisory council . 
  in reality not even her fellow party members think that we can go back to business with the us as if nothing happened . 
   hence why not trying to be a dick and totally off topic , but is that grammatically correct ? 
   special relationship we had one ? 
  it was ok as a kid but became awkward after becoming a teenager ... 
  i 'd rather sleep on the floor now . 
  that 's alright . 
  i just thought , this did n't sound quite right . 
  in this case he is just stupid . 
  maybe someone should tell him that russia destroyed his 3rd reich dream just as much as the us . 
   the us has fucked with our wars twice , they have bombed property of my family , they nearly killed my grandfather . 
  i 'm actually pretty sure he 's just a troll . 
  do n't feed him . 
  i fully agree with you on that . 
  that 's why your sentence :  money might be fiat and `` not real '' but the guns , tanks , ship & planes sure as fuck are does n't make sense to me . 
  following this scenario , how would your guns and tanks and bombs be of any use to you ? 
  if everything collapses there will be no army to operate your weapons . 
  if anything this is more of a downside . 
  in a situation like this it 's not very hard for some lunatic to get his hands on some of these toys that are also on american soil . 
  you might feel safe to sleep with a gun under your pillow , but as a european this would n't make me feel safe at all . 
  so he hates the us and likes russia because it was russia who took over berlin and forced the nazis to surrender ? 
  i do n't think that your initial assumption is correct . 
  thanks for the warning i guess . 
  just another reason to not trust the us . 
   now ... imagine ... a world where china , the european union and america collapse economically . 
  the three most important pillars of the world economy ... . gone . 
  everybody 's fucked . 
  and that 's the time to let your guns talk ? 
   made ** austria ** lose both world wars austria ? 
  are they the baddies now ? 
   money might be fiat and `` not real '' but the guns , tanks , ship & planes sure as fuck are and who is going to operate all those fancy toys , if you can not pay your soldiers ? 
  if the government shutdown told us one thing it 's , that the us runs on dollars . 
  saying that money does n't matter as long as you have your guns is a little too american for this european . 
  steinmeier clearly favors a diplomatic solution to the crisis ( who does n't ) . 
  but he also kind of avoids to give a precise answer to the question whether he still thinks that a military escalation is out of the question . 
  you do n't say !, 
  ... yet . 
  we 're working on that . 
  you sure you responded to the right person ? 
  because that is pretty much what i said . 
  according to / u/g _ morgan , / u/trucidator , / u/mkvgtired the currency used at the geographical location does n't matter . 
  go ask them . 
  nobody said , that the banks will move out of london tomorrow , we are talking about the next 20 years . 
  the european central bank headquarters are currently built in frankfurt not london , which is one clear statement . 
  i think if the uk will not become part of the euro - , dollar - or yen-zone in the long run , chances are good the financial sector will move elsewhere . 
  ** edit : ** starting the sentence explicitly with `` i think '' . 
  get downvotes for having an opinion . 
  no , i was saying i doubt that reuters uk would print russian propaganda . 
  by reuters , uk ? 
  i doubt it . 
  last time i checked i was real . 
  what do you mean by `` jingo '' ? 
  that 's why we should be ready . 
  they are currently the ones provoking , do n't you think ? 
   you want our forces to mobilize and move at very high cost to poland and the baltics , in large numbers ? 
  what would that help besides costing billions of euros ? 
  showing solidarity with our eu family , and let russia know we do n't fuck around . 
  ultimately this will give us credit with the eu and nato partners like the us . 
  does russia want that ? 
  reference to `` the life of brian '' . 
  forget it . 
   if russia attacks poland all nato countries will fill poland up to the brim with military . 
  i mean that 's not a thing where we would compliment france on finally getting with the program . 
  i was taking about actually sending combat units and not just logistical and humanitarian support ( not to diminish those ) . 
  i just want to have us engaged more . 
  this constant hesitation makes us look like amateurs . 
   did n't we ( nato ) do that already ? 
  i want us ( germany/the bundeswehr ) to take an active role . 
  you know actually * use * all that fancy and expensive equipment we have . 
  i know , i was trying to understand / u/dontgoatsemebro 's view . 
  the aqueducts ? 
  but it 's really not about the millions of unemployed russians . 
  it 's the russian oligarchs that will really get hurt and are targeted by these sanctions . 
  and they have a strong voice that must be heard by putin . 
   so specifically what freedoms have they lost ? 
  choosing not to be russian ? 
  brb issuing marching order . 
  it would be worth mine . 
  i can not make the same decision for others . 
   you think russia is going to invade poland , are you fucking loopy ? 
  no , i do n't think so right now . 
  but i would n't ** bet ** on it either . 
   preemptively invade russia to stop them invading nato ? 
  economic sanctions . 
  show military power . 
  have them know , we do n't fuck around . 
  what are you suggesting ? 
  grabbing some popcorn and enjoying the show ? 
  so the closest nato country to russia would be poland . 
  naturally you ( the uk ) are not that much concerned personally about the russian threat yet since russia would still be far away if it attacked the first nato country . 
  for poles ( or germans for that matter ) the threat is geographically much closer . 
  that 's why i think we should stop russia as soon as possible . 
  since you do n't have a flair , can i ask you which country you are from ? 
  that was n't an answer to my question . 
  when is enough enough ? 
  where should we draw the line to stop russia ? 
  what 's the alternative ? 
  let russia annex the shit out of their neighbors , until they come knocking at your door ? 
  my dad used to say `` der kl\u00fcgere gibt nur so lange nach bis er der dumme ist '' ( a wise man should not retreat too far or he becomes a fool ), 
  well right now neither the uk nor france plays a big role in this conflict .
