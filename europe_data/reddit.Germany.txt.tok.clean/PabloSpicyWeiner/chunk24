  war ego shooters ( wolfenstein ) ? 
  yup . 
  i thought that was new mexico . 
  they are allowed in an artistic context ( movies , comics ... ) . 
  i ai n't even mad . 
  that 's awesome . 
  not if you know german . 
  for me it seems overly forced . 
  i do n't think you can win * this * battle in / r/europe, 
  makes you wonder where all this money goes , does n't it ? 
  are we secretly building jaegers already ? 
  by huge i was thinking of a uk/france size army . 
  what if i told you , that there are also other muslim nations besides turkey ? 
  but i agree , 20 % is way too high . 
  more like 5 % . 
  fair enough . 
  so how would america feel ? 
  i just ca n't believe people would be pleased to see germany gearing up . 
  honest question : how would the rest of europe feel , if we suddenly started to build up a huge army ? 
  what about nukes ? 
  it 's not a matter of money nor technology . 
  we just do n't * want * it . 
  and we do n't feel like we need it ... yet . 
   bring them down to their knees , without militaristic involvement problem is russia will involve its military before being brought down to their knees . 
   and frankly it is not this is getting a little chilish , do n't you think ? 
  i get it , you dislike german politics , but there is n't a single thing you can do about it . 
  so get over it . 
  germany acts in accordance to it 's peoples will . 
  and you ca n't be everybodys darling after all . 
   german supremacist contain yourself , your jealousy is showing . 
   did you miss the part where i want europe to act as one ? 
  and i told you why germany acts the way it acts , and that germany 's interest this is in fact also europe 's interest . 
  at least at this point in this situation . 
  after that you went all `` fuck that . 
  death to russia '' , and the discussion was over . 
  i really do n't like everything my country does , but in this matter they are acting perfectly in line with the public opinion . 
  the economy is secondary ? 
  seriously , how old are you ? 
  because you sound like a 12 year old , crying for war against russia . 
  do you even know what a dictator is ? 
  your childish war propaganda is hilarious . 
  if you want mighty denmark to go full rambo , go ahead . 
  but do n't come running if you get a bloody nose . 
  people here seem to not understand that europe 's and germany 's interest are pretty much the same . 
  it is also in europe 's interest to keep germany 's economy healthy . 
  who will pay for the next bailout ? 
  if germany is broke , europe is fucked . 
  well , we are in the pretty much same position , with the little difference that since we ( germany ) are part of the euro fuckup , we now have a responsibility . 
  so the best we can do in this situation is to keep our economy running . 
  what the fuck is wrong about that ? 
  frankfurt is the biggest european financial center after london . 
  and it would n't make much sense to have the ecb in a country that does n't even have the euro . 
  you should really work on that germanophobia . 
  [ the euro was forced upon germany as a price for reunification . 
  get your facts straight ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/351531-you-get-unification-we-get-euro ) . 
  we never wanted to dump the deutschmark . 
  tell me , who will be paying the major part of the next greece-style bankruptcy ? 
  the uk ? 
  oh , please , do n't make me laugh . 
  it is in europe 's best interest to keep germany 's economy running . 
   hitler you lost this thread . 
  [ ronaldo approves ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zawyhcakcbm/ufjfbeqal_i/aaaaaaaadd4/vv4qaeyk0h8/s1600/cristiano-ronaldo-jews.gif ), 
   because the german economy is sacrosanct so the german government acting in germany 's interest is bad now . 
  got it . 
   ecb is going to send a whole region of europe to the wall as part of a project designed with german benefits in mind what are you talking about ? 
  as a [ german ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gva78enesbq/ub9ex44bl6i/aaaaaaaamzs/fxqwty3kc-c/s1600/dont-believe-you.gif ), 
  go and feed your kangaroos . 
  this is a yropean matter . 
  you wot m8 ? 
  on a deal-with-your-past scale of 1 to germany , i 'll give you a 3 . 
  [ in this case ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dont_believe_you_anchorman.gif ) no , really , they might be center-left voting , middle class members of the kkk ( not saying they are or implying you are ) , so they are still not representative . 
  50 % is just nothing i can confirm for the people i know . 
  hell , every 5th person is a muslim . 
  says more about your social environment than anything else , does n't it ? 
  we do n't hate the game , we hate the players . 
  ;o) no for real , where is the source for this ? 
  50 % seeing muslims unfavorably ca n't be right , that would be every other person . 
  [ a poll for germany 's state television had a similar result ] ( http://imgur.com/rf6iter ) [ the result of the spon poll ] ( http://imgur.com/b8trgpf ), 
  umm , no . 
  good point . 
  the ~ ~ nsa ~ ~ us trade representative can oppose all he wants . 
  this is a european matter , and luckily the us do n't have a say . 
  next stop : getting rid of microsoft and apple products and build something better . 
  [ do you like it in the butt ? 
  because that 's how you get it in the butt ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/nsa-spies-on-its-own-five-eyes-spy-partners-7000023454/ )  at this rate i do n't think they are on track to make the `` outer eye '' group , with the likes of france , netherlands and denmark ... and suddenly this does n't look like some privilege , but rather like an agreement to get buttraped by a former colony . 
  it 's almost hilarious how deep the uk has sunk . 
  your downfall is inevitable . 
  get used to it . 
  [ yes , it 's totally just politics ] ( https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140331/07443526745/new-leaks-show-nsa-gchq-infiltrating-private-german-companies.shtml ), 
   well the germans hate us . 
  do you really think that you getting caught spying on us would not have any consequences ? 
  think again . 
  do n't let the door hit you on the way out . 
  bath salts . 
  not even once . 
   `` the fpf is nothing more than a commercial death star ... '' you had my curiosity , now you have my attention . 
  my body is ready . 
   lost the war ** muh bridges !, 
   lack of support by the american people has given a victory to the socialist republic of vietnam .
