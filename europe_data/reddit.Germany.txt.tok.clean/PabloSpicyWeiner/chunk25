  and then there was vietnam , where you got your asses handed to you . 
  the us is way too overrated in terms of military ability . 
  and it 's not the lack of material and equipment . 
  it 's the lack of willpower . 
  hollywood movies are n't documentaries , you know . 
  at least russia is able to spy on us without getting caught . 
  america ... not so much . 
  ** woosh ** , united states european command ( stuttgart , germany ) gone . 
  ** boom ** , united states special operations command europe ( stuttgart , germany ) gone . 
  ** dingeling ** , united states africa command ( stuttgart , germany ) gone . 
  i 'm ok with that . 
  [ `` perspective '' ] ( http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/xj52caea1f.jpg ) . 
  and we do n't run around whining like little bitches , because some bridges got wet . 
  pathetic confirmed . 
  go on with your circlejerk . 
  wrong , it is ** precisely ** what this thread is about . 
  and it 's the very answer to the question that is even in the title ( bombed for `` some reason '' ) . 
  here 's a little number to work with : only in srebrenica it was around 8000 people . 
  that 's why the nato bombed you . 
  you could learn a lot from germany and how to properly deal with your past crimes . 
  instead you people go all nationalistic and play down the crimes you did . 
  well , waazd called you out directly , and all you are doing is trying to weasel out . 
  so let me repeat the initial question that is still unanswered : ** how many bosnians were killed during the course of the ( serbian-initiated ) bosnian war ? 
  ** take on , or fuck off . 
  pathetic . 
  eddy ^ ^ so ^ ^ close, 
  oh , cry me a river about your bridges . 
  should have thought about that before massacring thousands of civilians . 
  transportation routes and logistical facilities are always among the first targets . 
  that 's just basic warfare . 
  [ `` blasts '' ] ( http://makeameme.org/meme/blasts ), 
  that was also my `` wut '' moment . 
  you know how to spot quality journalism ? 
  when some weird backbencher gives his opinion and the headline claims that this person speaks for the whole country . 
  maybe ? 
  maybe ?? 
  there is no maybe . 
  it 's a fact . 
  are you with us or against us ? 
  damn commies with their propaganda !, 
   oh wow , france actually doing something for us ... you sound a little pissed . 
  are you in distress ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  [ yeah , fuck them russo-germans . 
  i mean literally , i would . 
  let 's assume your argument is relevant in numbers ( it is n't ) . 
  so basically you are saying that those children do n't want to put sanctions on russia today because they so feel so connected to their raping grandfathers , they know nothing about . 
  [ ca n't argue with that logic . 
   there are about 3,500,000 native russian speakers in germany i do n't know which germany you are from , but [ one quarter is probably just you talking out of your ass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians_in_germany ), 
  impossible , ~ ~ we already integrated them into our jaegers ~ ~ the dogs ate them . 
   most germans have a russian grandfather lolwut ? 
  thanks , mate . 
  it 's not even the `` do n't mention the war '' attitude that pisses me off . 
  if it fits into the conversation , please do mention the war . 
  it would just be nice to read `` mercedes '' , `` apfelstrudel '' or `` octoberfest '' instead of `` hitler '' , `` g\u00f6bbels '' and `` blitzkrieg '' when someone talks about germany from time to time . 
  what the hell are you talking about ... oh , i almost forgot about * that * episode over reading about it at last 20 times a day in / r/europe . 
  interestingly mostly by people trying to make an argument , when having nothing to argue about . 
  i 'm still amazed that this guy was allowed to go on a election roadshow here in germany . 
  who 's next ? 
  same applies to germans and scrabble ... wait . 
  nice try , polish ministry of defense . 
  i know , man , and i 've read your apology as well as your explanations in the original thread . 
  they were pretty plausible and i do n't think / u/noctarchy had any reason to be such a dick about it . 
  i do n't know why but people misusing their power just makes me furious . 
  jep , at least there was / u/heep _ purple , which was a dutch moderator . 
  but as you said , the jerk kicked him in a burst of megalomania . 
  i know , i 'm just trying to do conversation here ;o), 
   recruiting a reliable dutch-speaking moderator to deal with that for you i agree , but this is exactly what that douchebag refused to do . 
  instead he insisted that from now on / r/netherlands shall have no other gods before him . 
  and that 's what i was criticizing from the beginning . 
  yes , but how can you do your job well if you are unable to detect spam or insults written in dutch ? 
  you will always have to rely on someone reporting it . 
  it should be required if you 're the * only * moderator . 
  wow , what a douche . 
  i think this is one of the rare occasions where an administrator should step in and just remove him from this subreddit . 
  it 's not like the domain `` reddit '' belongs to him . 
  secondly , not only is he obviously a dick , but ** he does n't even speak dutch ?? 
  ** how the fuck can he be ** the only moderator ** of / r/netherlands ? 
  there should be rules to prevent that . 
  using google translate for all the dutch pms ? 
  mind = blown . 
  just keep singing the song of your people , butthurt-curt . 
  this is gold . 
  fortunately for me i know you are not a typical american , but probably just some weird and angry redneck from bumfuck , alabama with internet access . 
  otherwise i would really feel sorry for your once great nation . 
  thanks for the laugh tough , buddy , but i got ta go now . 
  driving my mercedes on the autobahn , boosting the economy and shit . 
  you can dislike and downvote everything i said all you want , it 's still a fact . 
  actually seeing this triggered such emotions makes me pretty confident i am fucking right . 
  feel free raping your `` allies '' and enemies all you want . 
  seeing germany does not bend over like other wannabe friends of yours , seems to really hurt your fragile self esteem . 
  germany was always good to tell where the future is , and it seems like it 's not the us . 
  what you are doing with bombs we do with diplomacy . 
  the difference is , that you are paying with blood , while we enjoy life and not having our skyscrapers bombed by people we pissed off . 
  you are doing the dirty job . 
  now who is whose bitch ? 
  so , good luck with your next government shutdown . 
  yeah , that invasive spying on other leaders did really work out great with russia and the crimea crisis , did n't it ? 
  wait , it did not , because the russkies knew that the us is in fact a hostile nation and adopted defensive measures , and so the ** nsa had no fucking clue what they were up to . 
  ** germany must now accept the fact that the us is in fact a hostile nation and learn from it 's mistakes .
