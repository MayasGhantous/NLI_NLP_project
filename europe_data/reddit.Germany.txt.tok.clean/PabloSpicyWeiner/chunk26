  shame on you if you fool me once , shame on me if you fool me twice . 
  i 'm sure the bnd did not participate in tapping merkels phone . 
  that would be illegal . 
  i assure you that the nsa affair is a much bigger deal here in germany , than you might imagine . 
  just because it 's not the the papers anymore does n't mean it 's over . 
  our government will now reconsider our relationship with the us and act appropriately . 
  we are n't friends , but suspicious partners at best . 
  the sooner we accept this fact , the better . 
  what you are seeing now is the result . 
  [ and it 's not like germany was begging to be a member of the ` five eyes ' ] ( http://www.dw.de/us-lawmakers-push-for-german-entrance-to-five-eyes-spy-alliance/a-17246049 ) , but not being a member [ is n't that bad after all . 
  ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/nsa-spies-on-its-own-five-eyes-spy-partners-7000023454/ ) better know your enemies , instead of getting stabbed in the back . 
  oh , contain your envy , america . 
  that moment you decided to stab us in the back with your nsa spying was the moment our love died . 
  now watch us lift off !, 
   china sees germany as the most useful country well , thank you ... 
  edit : and why did you delete the `` british air space '' part ? 
  are you just desperately trying to be an arse ? 
  and rightly so . 
  it 's the wrong subreddit . 
  attention whoring . 
  murica edition . 
  just did it out of curiosity ( google germany ) : * scotland -  margaret thatcher ( close enough ? ), 
  * wales -  nothing edit : searching in german releaved just on suggestion : * warum hassen die schotten ... [ die engl\u00e4nder ? 
  it 's interesting how the most hatred towards britain/england seems to come from `` the closer family '' like ireland and australia . 
  it 's like kids hating their parents for being parents . 
  hate sheet : * france hates britain and america * estonia hates russia * poland hates russia * sweden hates finland * ireland hates britain and england * portugal hates spain * romania hates hungary * austria does n't hate england , but australia does , which seems to be close enough for google wow . 
  that 's just the alphabetical order . 
  according to the [ actual chart ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/images/innovation-performance-2014.jpg ) sweden is in fact the leader followed by denmark , germany and finland . 
  tomorrow putin will tell the press that those were in fact german , french and british mercenaries trying to make mother russia look like a bitch . 
  oh , you were joking . 
  please continue . 
  ^ just ^ following ^ the ^ rumor ^ that ^ germans ^ ca n't ^ understand ^ jokes, 
  all hitler and nazi jokes aside , but if putin is stupid enough to break into our backyard , it 's definitely on . 
  and here i am thinking the uk was the uk of europe . 
  explaining germany 's foreign policy in regard of it 's past , and why our politicians act the way they do today in regard to their role in europe , and why this has nothing to do with `` having spine '' would take too much effort . 
  educate yourself , or do n't . 
  i could n't care less . 
   not surprised about germany oh , go fuck yourself with a cactus , you prick . 
  `` might '', 
  [ now look who is talking ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10674503/ukraine-crisis-uk-prepares-to-rule-out-sanctions-on-russia-amid-threat-to-global-economy.html ) . 
  not sure if serious ... schr\u00f6der is just putins puppy . 
  they are best buddies , and for schr\u00f6der putin is a ( translated quote ) `` flawless democrat '' . 
  if we had it schr\u00f6ders way , germany would be lying on its back , drooling and waiting for russia to rub our belly . 
  so nope , bad idea . 
  1 . who decides what an insurgent and what a freedom fighter is ? 
  [ i 'll just leave this here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murat_kurnaz ) 2 . the exact question was , and i quote :  go on , give me evidence of people being arrested for the sake of political convenience and my answer was guantanamo . 
  people were being arrested for the sake of political convenience ( because they did fight the us troops ) . 
  the question was n't about domestic political opponents or the like . 
  i 'm not defending the taliban or anything here , all i 'm saying is that the western should n't point the finger too easily , or it might be thrown back in our faces . 
  please enlighten me . 
  that was actually a traditional bavarian/austrian marriage proposal . 
  or they can just crush everyone with their giant balls of steel . 
  poland talking big towards a bigger neighbor . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  noooooo !, 
  we made a huge mistake . 
  can confirm . 
  you wo n't like us when we 're angry . 
  of course i did . 
  people were arrested for the sake of political convenience in guantanamo . 
  that was no health resort . 
   go on , give me evidence of people being arrested for the sake of political convenience that was your criteria , and i gave you that evidence . 
   leaked this ( probably the americans ) but , but , but they said they would stop listening to merkels phone . 
  are you saying they * lied * to us ? 
  i doubt it . 
  stalingrad is just too cold for us . 
   go on , give me evidence of people being arrested for the sake of political convenience . 
  * cough ... * guantanamo ... * cough *, 
  i do n't know what to make of this . 
  germany should have been the mediator in this crisis . 
  if merkel says there is no way to negotiate with putin , shit might get real pretty fast . 
  and everyone else . 
  well , she 'd better get her ass out of that coma thing , because there 's a lot of work waiting for her . 
  [ tell me more ] ( https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3a%2f%2f1-media-cdn.foolz.us%2fffuuka%2fboard%2ftg%2fimage%2f1374%2f83%2f1374838299294.jpg&amp;t=537&amp;c=az7fnmv8mo8diq ), 
  that 's ok . maybe something got lost in translation . 
  correct . 
  that 's why i called him a dick . 
  when your explanation is based on `` because all others were dicks '' , then yes . 
  yes , it is . 
  pretty much . 
  you give an explanation why it happened and your explanation was that officers at frankfurt airport are dicks . 
  this way people can relate to him and excuse his actions . 
  but whatever . 
  i really do n't care that much about all this . 
   i never excused his actions , i explained why i think it happened as it did . 
  which is pretty much the same , is n't it ? 
  i think it happened because he is a fucking dick who ca n't handle booze . 
  even ** if ** the situation was just like protasiewicz said ( which i doubt ; it 's two small bottles of wine by now , not just one glass ) a testy and crude person with such little self control should not be working anywhere near the european parliament , let alone being the freaking vice president . 
  what a stupid headline for a quite interesting article . 
  and i thought we were on probation ... 
  do n't throw your grenades away , yet . 
   sorry , i admit defeat . 
  churchill must be spinning in his grave right now ... ;o), 
   all three of them ** doo-dah , doo-dah **, 
   our total gold medal count in the summer olympics beats you !, 
  uuum , no . 
  [ that 's just the same `` split germany in two countries '' - bullshit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/summer_olympic_games ) i know they say brits tend to live in the past , but seriously the gdr is gone long time ago . 
  [ this is a proper all time summer olympics medal count ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ewiger_medaillenspiegel_der_olympischen_spiele ) [ same for the winter games ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ewiger_medaillenspiegel_der_olympischen_winterspiele ) [ and this one is just for my own entertainment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all-time_table_of_the_fifa_world_cup ), 
   now compare that to a properly maintained one  instant efficiency boner . 
  in your face , island monkeys .
