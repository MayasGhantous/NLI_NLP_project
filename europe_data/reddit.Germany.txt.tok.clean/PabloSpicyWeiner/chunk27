  that 's what i do , because i ca n't stand '' \u00df '' . 
  now i 'll just wait for the brits and their ss jokes . 
  [ fick dich weg , du homof\u00fcrst ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diuyne4sasy ), 
  in this context i would say `` fremder '' ( stranger ) would be best . 
  you were right with `` ausl\u00e4nder '' = foreigner . 
  `` ausserirdischer '' is a little to scientific but was actually used in another movie title translation : e.t. 
  the extraterrestrial -  e.t. 
  der ausserirdische which is a pretty spot-on translation, 
   wow ... that alien title sounds like a 1950s buck rogers style throwback !, 
  yep , could n't get much cheesier . 
  the funny thing is it still has the word `` alien '' in the title , but in a different context . 
  it 's more like the name of the creature . 
  given that that movie was first shown in germany in the late 70s and english was n't as widely spoken as it is today , this even makes sense : * - `` have you seen that new movie with alice the monster ? 
  '' * * - `` it 's name was alien , not alice '' * * - `` oh , yeah . 
  right '' *, 
  yes it is . 
  if you want to see a certain movie with subtitles your best chance is to wait for the bluray . 
  having said this , dubbing in germany is usually really good . 
  on the downside a lot of movies have a completely new title in germany ( yes , * new * titles , not just translated ) . 
  and this is often just ridiculous : * alien -- das unheimliche wesen aus einer fremden welt * -  translated : ** alien - the creepy creature from a strange world . 
  ** ( orig : alien ) * voll auf die n\u00fcsse * -  translated : ** right in the balls ** ( orig : dodgeball : a true underdog story ), 
  mostly movies and tv series ( us dubbed 60 % german 40 % ) . 
  other media almost nonexistent ( except for the oscars and the superbowl maybe ) . 
  news , magazines , talk shows or games shows are 100 % german . 
  eu and us : ** germany should take on greater responsibility and also contribute to military actions . 
  ** * everbody claps , standing ovations , champagne and hookers everywhere * germany : ** we should take on greater responsibility and also contribute to military actions . 
  ** * everybody loses their shit and godwins the fuck out * make up your fucking mind , world . 
  [ surprise anschluss is best anschluss . 
  waiting for your next government shutdown and hope it 's permanently this time . 
  ... and hookers . 
  now be a good canadian and apologize . 
  the design looks awesome . 
  i bet some mods over in / r/germany and / r/deutschland are bowing their heads in shame right now . 
  yes , i 'm talking to you , mods of / r/germany and / r/deutschland : ** your css is bad and you should feel bad . 
   that could quite possibly lead to the uk leaving the eu * yawn * those empty promises are really tiring . 
  maybe try something different , like holding your breath until everyone agrees to do things the uk way . 
  putin begs to differ . 
  aaand gazprom gerd , of course . 
  putins puppy can go and fuck himself for good . 
  i 'm totally on your side here . 
  i do n't want a germany military based on the american model . 
  since we are protected by the nato i guess it is the same instance that decides what a good cause is . 
  i would never support autonomous military intervention without a un or nato mandate . 
  i said we * expect * people to die . 
  every time an allied force acts on it 's own ( in our interest ) where we could have helped , people are risking their lives . 
   produce nothing of lasting value ? 
  these actions produce stability . 
  about fucking time . 
  it 's a shame how we expect others to die for us ( and pay them ) . 
  we have the technology , we have the equipment . 
  why not use it to stand for a good cause . 
  probably 4 . 
  hell no, 
  what ? 
  how dare you , you chauvinist !, 
  i 'm sure she can handle modern warfare just as fine as running a kindergar ... oh look a butterfly !, 
  do n't make me declare war on ukraine . 
  just for fun and giggles . 
  what ? 
  did i already declare war on them before ? 
  sometimes i get a little confused with all that geography and shit . 
  so many countries , so little time . 
  i 'm really starting to feel a little uncomfortable reading about machines teaching themselves , and armed autonomous acting robots ( just yesterday ) . 
  just kidding . 
  i for one welcome our new artificial overlords . 
  it 's funny how the article talks about `` germany '' when in fact it was just some minor suit giving his own personal view . 
  if that 's how it works : i hereby declare war on russia . 
  i 'm free for good-paying interviews now . 
  well , you guys do n't have the dubbing problem that we have in germany ( and probably a bunch of other countries , too ) . 
  foreign movies / tv shows are usually dubbed here . 
  as this dubbing process takes a lot of time , tv shows are broadcasted half a year to a year after the first-run in the us ( depending on the amount of people watching . 
  it 's a little different for movies , especially blockbusters like lotr ) . 
  unless average hans m\u00fcller is n't able to watch breaking bad in english we will always have this problem here . 
  using netflix us via vpn is an attractive option for those people that have no problem with watching movies in their original language . 
  so * hypothetically speaking * i could watch movies and tv shows * before * they are even aired in germany by using a vpn connection to netflix us ? 
  for sientific research , of course . 
  because i am totally willing to make that sacrifice in the name of science . 
  thanks . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  i 'm currently using lovefilm ( amazon ) , but the streaming selection there is rather poor . 
  if netflix offers a better choice , i might give it a try . 
  excuse my ignorance but can someone eli5 what netflix exactly is ? 
  is it just another video streaming portal ? 
  and if so why all the hype ? 
  we already have plenty of them . 
  newbie detected . 
  that picture circulates in / r/europe for quite some time now . 
  it already is a ` thing ' . 
  in science we trust .

  [ proxtube ] ( https://proxtube.com/?lang=de ) problem , gema ? 
  * gentlemen , the poland invasion is cancelled . 
  the chance of britain making fun of us if things go downhill is too damn high . 
  sounds like a typical soccer worldcup . 
  i think not . 
  we are still pretending we forgot how to war . 
  i know .
