  9/11 happened for a reason . 
  so which country do you want me to be ashamed of ? 
  the one my parents are from , the one i was born in or the one i am currently living in ? 
  he 's got a point . 
  i 'm neither your teacher nor your parent . 
  i could n't care less about the education of some some dull nobody on the internets .
