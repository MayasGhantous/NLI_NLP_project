  if serbia is unable to control their hooligans they should be completely banned from this tournament . 
  this is disgusting and a disgrace to this sport . 
  inside job confirmed . 
   no you are silly . 
  and you smell of poo . 
  3 year old confirmed . 
   me and kwonza are the second case . 
  we are both on complete different ends of the spectrum in this case and we will never get each other . 
  a debate between us two will only end up like mindless accusing each other of bunches of stuff . 
  and yet you were the one starting to answer him with pointless  putin khuilo lalalalalalala comments . 
  so since you knew from the beginning that this can not end in a civil discussion , there is only one reason for your comments : you are trying to be a douche by provoking a reaction with your childish comments . 
  and that is a line of attack a 3 year old would come up with . 
  point proven ? 
  dude , just ... stop . 
  it 's getting really embarrassing now . 
   discussing on the internet is pointless that 's funny because people usually come here to ** discuss ** things . 
  so reddit might not be the right place for you then . 
  you might want to try 4chan instead . 
  compared to your responses he seems to be the civil guy in this thread here . 
  you just make yourself look like a fool . 
  and that 's rather counterproductive if you are trying to get a message through . 
  think about it . 
  just ignore him . 
  he does n't speak for anyone but himself . 
  judging by your mature and well thought answers , he 'll probably wreck you in a real argument in a matter of seconds anyway . 
  how old are you ? 
  i love how those downvotes just kept coming and coming .

  the one with the gun . 
  but , but , but the earthquakes !!, 
  good man . 
  i gave mine in another thread but got downvoted by some tree-huggers for having one . 
  i 'm not gon na fall for that again . 
  pretty much everywhere . 
  you 're an aussie so it 's more like upside down . 
  so autumn , much wow . 
  no homo !, 
  ^ yeah ^ that ^ was ^ too ^ easy, 
  op should change the title to wannabe newscasters speaking then . 
  good job finding the bulldog of german news . 
  no , seriously , who the fuck is the german presenter ? 
  never heard her name , never seen her . 
  [ why not come up with a newscaster people actually know ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmhvsrtydm0 ) edit : `` israel heute '' ? 
  is that a german speaking news channel in israel ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  russian standard vodka is da shit . 
  and fear . 
  what an idiot . 
  just sell lots of stuff to europe and make lots of mone ... oh , nevermind . 
  ok , let 's say you can not replace the hardware without russia , which i doubt , then why not still use them while they are still working perfectly ? 
  that 's like not driving a car because you might not get spare parts in the future . 
  and i 'm not talking about oldtimer cars or exotic sports cars here , i 'm talking about utility vehicles . 
  go back to w\u00f6rk , portugal !,

  exactly . 
  they made their choice . 
   peasants so gucci and prada wo n't even notice ? 
  interesting . 
  fuck you nazi adidas . 
   wont give a crab real oligarchs should give nothing less than lobster . 
   other than that i agree with you . 
  unless they can be remote controlled by moscow i see no sense in doing that . 
  so no more prada and gucci for oligarchs wives ? 
  i have a feeling that this was n't thoroughly thought through . 
  that 's because the american part usually weighs double . 
  brb . 
  off to terminus . 
  ^ just ^ kidding , ^ noone ^ comes ^ back ^ from ^ terminus, 
  2 norwegians 1 hybrid ? 
  bravo , you have just proven my point . 
  they are just another superpower like the us . 
  let 's see : * constanly shrinking economy . 
  * polulation tired of wars than never before in it 's history and losing confidence in all branches of their government . 
  * government shutdown . 
  * debt-to-gdp ratio at around 106 percent . 
  that 's what you call a superpower but russia a wannabe superpower ? 
  yeah , right . 
  the only thing they have is their military . 
  and that will be of no use if it comes to an open war with for example russia . 
  if the nukes are flying everyone is fucked . 
  hollywood movies are n't documentaries . 
  they are a superpower . 
  and that 's why everyone already loses their shit before they even got started fucking shit up . 
  denying this is just delusional and dangerous . 
  i 'll laugh in everyones face that calls russia a `` wannabe '' superpower . 
  they could fuck up your country in a matter of days . 
  any day . 
  unless you can say the same about poland , i suggest you should stop sucking american cock and snap back to reality . 
   they are a wannabe superpower if they are just wannabes , why are you shitting your pants then ? 
  coming from cyprus it 's the shortes way to get to norway . 
  and arab flag what ? 
  what ? 
  we must know . 
  so in other words , merkel is acting in the interest of those that actually have the power to remove her from her position ?
