  i want to believe . 
  i ca n't believe that nobody noticed the ufo hovering above the embassy . 
  do n't forget [ schaschlik ] ( http://static.woxikon.com/images/rezepte/1/3/hd_137_mainimage.jpg ) . 
  best served right from the grill with some vinegar marinated onions . 
  yes . 
  then who was phone ? 
  no it 's a u.s. state located on the atlantic coast in the mid-atlantic region of the united states . 
   we are n't 4chan . 
  cool , edgy and obscene usernames that show how far you can push `` freedom of speech '' are stupid . 
  anonymous ? 
  well , it 's a matter of definition , is n't it ? 
  following your definition , `` cocksucker '' is an acceptable term for male homosexuals , because that 's what they do , right ? 
  and `` retard '' is acceptable for mentally challenged people , because , well , they are . 
  however , i agree with your second point . 
   is a bit of an idiot apparently for saying things like that . 
  and `` furzknoten '' ? 
  really ? 
  takes me right back to 2nd grade . 
  everybody has the right to act stupid , you , however , are abusing that privilege . 
  they will be when the polar caps are really starting to melt . 
  in particular the shepherds . 
  those nasty buggers do n't even have blue eyes and give us a bad reputation . 
  germans have no sense of humour , are rich as fuck and have a secret military base on the dark side of the moon where we are preparing for another world war . 
  more than half of our population are in fact robots . 
  this is all true . 
  but contrary to popular belief , we do n't like dogs . 
  we hate those hairy , drooling bastards . 
  so how did your life change after becoming a celebrity ? 
  that 's a fake result . 
  there was only one germany whereas the reddit poll had at least 5 germanies to choose from . 
  are you trying to make merkel responsible for internal affairs of other eu members now ? 
  kindly clean up your own pigsty . 
  you sound like germany pretty much owns the eu . 
   they sure are a patient people , those germans . 
  up to a certain extend . 
  after that , bad things happen . 
  bending over might be an acceptable option for merkel , but obviously not for the people anymore . 
  good . 
  i agree . 
  but in this case she should n't expect too much from me either . 
  i 'm sorry , sir but you have a bad case of `` special relationship '' . 
  my voting descision this year will be strongly affected by the way our government reacts to this . 
  i expect merkel to go on the offensive now that this line has been ( openly ) crossed . 
  policy of appeasement has failed . 
  time to grow some balls . 
  i 've read the first warp flight will take place in about 50 years . 
  well , my knowledge of the scottish ( gaelic ? ), 
  language is also quite limited . 
  all i know is `` slainte '' . 
  but that was still enough to make friends there ;o), 
  if you speak german i recommend [ gmx ] ( http://www.gmx.net/ ) or [ web.de ] ( http://web.de ) . 
  nice try , third world country intelligence agency . 
   step 4 : profit !!, 
  ftfy, 
  to be fair , that bike is smoking hot . 
  nope . 
  never used gmail for sensitive communication anyways . 
  however it encouraged me to add sublimal messages to my emails . 
  you know some `` uranium '' here , some `` 72 virgins '' there . 
  right , because prism only protects our freedoms , hurr durr . 
  and germany , as we all know , is the most spied out county in europe because of our terrorists . 
  no industrial espionage involved . 
  i wonder how much of the google car is actually prism stolen german technology . 
  they are only for humanitarian purposes . 
  the torpedos are filled with pure love !, 
   auscannzukus bless you !, 
  the axis of snoopers ^ tm ? 
  that 's deep , man, 
  national security is at stake ? 
  release the jaegers . 
  americans seem to be pretty obsessed with their heritage . 
  but then again i wished i could say i was german-irish-inuit-cherokee . 
  second germany is best germany . 
  angela merkel  ... the balls ... ... ** balls ** umm , i think there is something you need to know ... 
  stasi methods was really inappropriate . 
  gestapo methods would have been much more suitable . 
  yeah if she could go ahead and be just as shocked about her own country being heavily spied out by the fucking nsa , that 'd be great . 
  [ a form of traditional singing is called `` lilting '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm_oaqw_qrm&amp;list=rd02qkchjaw0e0e ) lyrics for your convenience : * diddle dee-doodle diddly dee die *, 
  til : kerrygold is genuine irish butter . 
  i thought that was just some slogan . 
  best.butter.ever . 
  can we burn some obama dummies instead ? 
  i 'm all in favor of giving snowden the german citizenship for his heroic act . 
  that would be hilarious . 
   ... swabians dislike people from the north of germany even more intensely than non-germans swabia : germanys lean , mean hating machine . 
  bonus points for calling your vet and making an appointment for your dog `` wapensgradeuranium '', 
  a politician speaking with a forked tongue . 
  in other news : water is wet . 
  not sure if my comment was taken seriously ... 
  google germany and facebook germany . 
  [ fair enough , fuck you to then ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f8iwabr.jpg ), 
  this is gold . 
  but we are n't good at liberating others , no matter how hard we try ... w-w-will you teach me , freedom buddy ? 
  * too well , that 's * your * opinion and not what i was saying . 
  for me this is whishful thinking . 
  hardly surprising you missed the logic . 
  can not follow the logic . 
  better answer in [ meme ] ( http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3ut2jl/ ), 
  we did it for our freedoms !, 
   maybe he 'll stand underneath the brandenburg gate and give a rousing speech about hope and change .
