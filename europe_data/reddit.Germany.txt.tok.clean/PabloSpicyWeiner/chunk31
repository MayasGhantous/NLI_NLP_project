  obama should send david hasselhoff to do the job instead . 
  i think he is more credible in germany right now . 
  you do not sound like a prick . 
  i was using the term friendship just because it is excessively used by obama when talking about europe . 
  granted the term `` friend '' seems to have different meanings in europe and the us . 
  so there might be something lost in translation here . 
  but you really overestimate the german bnd . 
  we pretty much just feed on everything we get from the us secret services . 
  this has to stop . 
  we should n't rely on nsa prefiltered information but rather start to establish a european security agency ourselves . 
  this agency may or may not trade information with the us ( and others ) but the nsa should not be our main source of information . 
  [ it 's about time ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/293/590/6f6.gif ), 
  obama sure has some explaining to do when visiting germany next week . 
  must be awkward for him given that germany is the number one target in europe for nsa surveillance activities . 
  i thinks it 's time for germany ( or europe ) to reconsider it 's relationship with the us and loosen it 's ties to washington in general . 
  we obviously are n't friends . 
  we should accept this fact and act accordingly . 
  do n't give too much weight to this . 
  we 're just a prostitute that wants to see money before we bend over . 
  story of my life . 
  hey murica , you jelly ?

  and , yes microsoft was one of the first companies to sign onto this cooperation with the us government . 
  how convenient ...

  i was referring to grammar nazism yes , of course you were , latvia boy . 
   have you finished correcting the mistakes , genose ? 
  but that word is usually only used by old communis ... oh wait , never mind . 
  oh , cry me a river . 
  just fyi , i did n't downvote you for your english but because your comment is kind of moronic . 
   nazism what ? 
  oh , yes my germany flair . 
  well , what can i say , that was really unexpected and original . 
  did you come up with that all by yourself , latvia boy ? 
  seriously , your complaint about bad western english would only come across half as funny if your own english was perfect . 
  they should at least have included [ ameristralia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ameristralia/ ), 
  i guess germany is the new canada . 
  just make sure the meat is well-hung before preparing it . 
  yeah , just what i thought . 
  all hat and no cattle . 
  now crawl back under that rock you came from , and enjoy the show , fuckwit . 
  feel free to offer a better solution . 
  criticism without offering an alternative is just pointless whining . 
  jesus , my comment was just tongue-in-cheek . 
  people in r/europe should really start to relax .

  also 16 countries is n't exactly the world , but anyways : suck it eurovision song contest . 
   why is europe so messed up ? 
  tl ; dr : because germany . 
  you should really kick us out . 
  we 're just spoiling the party . 
  so what are you saying ? 
  those 5000 people should also stay at home as long as we do n't find jobs for all of them ? 
  it 's a drop in a bucket but at least we are * trying * to do something . 
  you make it sound like we are going to send that poor thing right to auschwitz . 
  rest assured it will be looked after and be living with lots of other ~ ~ beibers ~ ~ monkeys in a zoo . 
  probably a much better life than it had so far . 
  edit : i accidently a word . 
  but they are n't literally hitler , are they ? 
  we had a nationalist monkey some time ago if that counts ... 
  and a freedom upvote for you , patriot . 
  to be fair , he did n't claim the monkey , [ because he did n't know where it is ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp7yfndtcfa ), 
  edit : fucking downvoting commies , keep hating us for our awesome freedom, 
  til i 'm american . 
  frankly , i do n't really care what everyone else likes . 
  i would consider voting if there ever was one song worth voting for ( = paying money ) , which up to now never happened . 
  right now voting would just mean to choose between plaque and cholera . 
  boys , boys !, 
  cut it out . 
  now you both come over here and shake hands . 
  no france , i do n't care who started . 
  uk , stop smirking , i 'm not even joking . 
  reach out , and shake your hands . 
  there you go . 
  that was n't too hard , was it ? 
  love , germany, 
  way to talk about your grandfather . 
  just ... wow .
