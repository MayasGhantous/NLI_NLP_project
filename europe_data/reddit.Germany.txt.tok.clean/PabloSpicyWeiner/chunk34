  for me it 's simply worcestershire sauce . 
  i ca n't live without it . 
  in soviet russia criminals accuse you . 
  curry like in indian dish ? 
  now i am of disappoint . 
  but he is right . 
  technically they are burning their own flags . 
  we did n't pay for them . 
  well , except maybe for the one that was ripped off the german embassy in nicosia . 
   too bad germans are to much pussies to do anything . 
  nice try , russia . 
  neither germany nor the eu brought up this levy . 
  it was your own government . 
  but i guess it 's just easier to blame others for your own mistakes . 
  cry me a fucking river . 
  the sooner you start to realize , that this attitude brought you into this situation in the first place the better for you . 
  i was referring to * myself * , as i can not speak for 82 million people . 
  also it 's funny how everyone talks about troikas offer on one hand but germany blackmailing cyprus on the other . 
  if you want to insult us , at least be fucking consistent . 
  wow , big fucking surprise . 
  and all this drama for what ? 
  cyprus you dissapointed in a number of ways . 
  rest assured , that the images of our burning flags will not be forgotten so easily . 
  oh , and you 're fucking welcome . 
  oh , i 'm pretty confident we are going to lose . 
  does n't matter . 
  went to paris . 
  it 's march when we march . 
  * whoop , whoop *, 
  so brave !, 
  templars anyone ? 
   in denmark and it 's april ca n't be our fault this time , because it 's still march here in germany . 
  [ photographic proof ] ( http://l.yimg.com/ao/i/hp/2011/news/july/license.jpg ), 
  what ? 
  those filthy bastards , let 's burn some cypriot flags and show the world that cyprus will not be bullied around by cyprus ... wait . 
  all those boring facts are giving me a headache . 
  why do n't we just burn the german flag and call them nazis . 
  life is much easier this way . 
  if chill pills are a suitable substitute for those painful eu money injections , i 'll take 2 !, 
  because germany . 
  that 's why . 
  this is actually a great idea . 
  we can sell them [ more of our flags ] ( http://www.flags-and-anthems.com/media/flags/flagge-belgien.gif ), 
  while i understand your point and also understand why people in cyprus are upset right now ( no , i do n't agree with sch\u00e4uble and i would have told him to go and fuck himself if he wanted to have 6 % of my savings ) , it 's important that the complaints are addressed properly . 
   it surely sents a message though , something that media and their propaganda can not use only to their benefit you think so ? 
  think again . 
  do you know what was on the news while i was having my first coffee this morning ? 
  a riot where the german flag is burned , and people holding signs comparing us to the nazis . 
  what a way to start your day . 
  of course this can and will be used as propaganda in a way that the german public does n't feel too bad for those `` ungrateful '' southerners . 
  anger leads to hate . 
  that 's bull . 
  the only option to change germany 's position on the eu is to vote far left or right . 
  and believe me , that would be even worse for all of us . 
  why did n't you vote right , before all this mess happened ? 
  burning our flag is pathetic . 
  this will not help you at all . 
  this is just sad . 
  flawless transcript of what ronaldo said . 
  ~ ~ good guy germany ~ ~ quite good but could be better guy germany edit : i somehow ignored the `` white colored '' countries as if they did n't participate . 
  my bad . 
  but i think we can all agree to : scumbag france, 
  i 'm pretty sure he said `` f ** k off '' at the end right after he said `` no technical questions '' when he was standing up to leave . 
  source : i 'm a professional lip reader . 
  a brit defending germany against an american ... what 's next ? 
  poland can into space ? 
  those comments ... stay classy , britain . 
  i hope north korea is on the to-do list ;o), 
   anglophilia is alive and well i would n't call it * philia * which implies affection . 
  i thinks it 's rather respect and attention . 
  love ? 
  not so much . 
  we already have this thing going with the french , you know . 
  [ that 's the spirit ;o) ] ( http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/28914641.jpg ), 
   the uk does n't ... 
  but you did invade countries outside of europe , did n't you ? 
  1 ) no 2 ) no, 
   evil anti-german bias your cynicism does not add to your credibility . 
  not being a native english speaker , i did get his point . 
  why did n't you ? 
   tea , lots of tea  flair : england [ mfw ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdnl8erfb91rrxhj7.gif ),

  hookers breakfast : coffee & cigarette, 
  i admit it may be a schnitzel bit cheesy . 
  heard the same , but never been there . 
  that was close . 
  hint : google translate this sentence with just ohne `` s '' in `` vergassen '', 
  i lol 'd . 
  the correct term is high velocity intercontinental balistic wurstmissile ( hvibwm ) . 
  not sausage , it 's ** wurst , wurst , wurst ** !!!!, 
  now write it down 1939 times . 
  useucom ( united states european command ) is located in stuttgart , germany , so i would n't expect them to leave anytime soon . 
  not going to happen . 
  while our tripod battalions reported combat readiness 2 years ago , our flying saucer brigade is not fully operational yet . 
  if by `` freedom '' you mean `` burglar gangs '' , then yes . 
  actually the german word for penis is `` fade '' . 
  it 's really funny to read all these comments `` put my country here '' , `` you have never been here in homophobistan '' , `` we 're gayer than you think '' . 
  i think i 'll just start answering with `` no '' .
