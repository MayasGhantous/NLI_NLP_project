  i 'm . not.even.gay . 
  ** but from the provided link :  in sofia , the capital of bulgaria , the first gay pride was even attacked with molotov cocktails, 
  well , the whole data seems to be based on the experiences of a few people . 
  it is definitely no representative statistic by the european council . 
  do n't put too much meaning into this . 
   transylvania is more like yellow and maybe even green twilight made gayness really popular in the vampire scene . 
  just to be clear : that data is not mine . 
  i just did a quick breakdown from the linked page . 
  breakdown from [ this page ] ( http://www.gaysontour.com/index.php?page=35&amp;lang=en&amp;phpsessid=022536edcb9a6cb876fae2f93ca61480 ) : ** green ( countries with a remarkable up to high level of freedom and acceptance ) : ** * austria * belgium * croatia * czech republic * denmark * finland * france * germany * greece * iceland * ireland * italy * luxemburg * malta * netherlands * norway * portugal * slovenia * spain * sweden * switzerland * united kingdom ** yellow ( homosexuals and their lifestyles are mostly considered as negative and absolutely taboo , ignorance is widespread ) : ** * cyprus * estonia * hungary * latvia * lithuania * poland * russia * slovakia * turkey ** red ( extreme homophobic attitudes and aggressions are widespread , mostly severe penal laws for homosexual acts ) : ** in many countries of eastern and south eastern europe homophobic attitudes are widespread . 
  even in major cities infrastructure is only developed on a low level . 
  gay life happens mostly in the closet . 
  following countries belong to this category : ( without czech republic and hungary ! ), 
  * albania * bosnia-herzegovina * bulgaria * macedonia * kosovo * moldova * montenegro * romania * serbia * ukraine * belarus edit : calm down people . 
  as mentioned in the beginning , it 's not my own data nor my personal opinion . 
  but here 's my offer to anyone who thinks their country is not displayed correctly : please drop me a pm and i will gladly tell everyone how gay i think this country is . 
  well if you will check my link for op , you will see that germany is rated green ( gay friendly ) and only 3 eastern european countries are also rated green . 
  all others are either yellow or red . 
   as if going to some skin head backway village in ~ ~ germany ~ ~ europe will not get you a bloody nose if you 're a minority ftfy . 
  nothing particular limited to germany . 
  you mean physically ? 
  google has 5 sites in germany with 500 employees . 
  yeah , i 'm sure that will teach germany . 
  or maybe not . 
  to draw this parallel is an insult to the people of italy, 
  keep it up poland . 
  you 're heading in the right direction . 
  82 million - 1 . 
  i still think he is a clown . 
  edit : just double checked : -2 my ( italian ) brother-in-law agrees . 
  brace for ww2 reference shitstorm in : 3 ... 2 ... 1, 
  i have n't seen all of germany yet , but from my experiences hamburg or munich is well worth a visit . 
  also the black forest , if you are more into nature and country live . 
  i recommend to ask this question in [ r/germany ] ( http://de.reddit.com/r/germany ) . 
  there are a lot of people from all over the country , that can give you some good locations , depending on the rough area you are planning to visit and your interests . 
  i drew this comparison because berlin ( washinton ) -  huge load of history , federal institutions . 
  hamburg , munich , cologne , dresden ( new york , l.a. , las vegas ) -  lots of fun things to do and see . 
  i 'd imagine it 's even worse for ( mighty ) london < -  rest of uk ? 
  to * have * them does not necessarily mean to * own * them . 
  i never said it is not * interesting * . 
  but then again so is hamburg , munich , cologne , dresden . 
  it 's like saying when visiting the us you have to go to washington rather than new york , l.a. or las vegas . 
  scientology is not recognized as a religion or church in germany . 
  it 's just a registered association . 
  so it 's more or less just a fantasy fan club which is monitored by the federal office for protection of the constitution . 
  same thing went though my mind :  norway : aurora polaris  france : louvre  france : eiffel tower from above  norway : landscape  norway : aurora polaris and jacuzzi  paris : eiffel tower by night  berlin : garbage on a basketball court also why does everyone think berlin is the shit ? 
  if you are planning to visit germany , berlin should not even be on the top three list . 
   relax commie that 's quality mod material right there . 
  nice try , hamburg . 
  fun fact : the german voice actor for christoph waltz was christoph waltz . 
  king schultz said in the movie that he did not have the opportunity to speak german for a long time . 
  and this still kinda works , because the audience * knows * , that he in fact talks english . 
  you just forget that the words you hear are actually german . 
  does this even make sense ? 
  in that very scene , they just kept talking in german . 
  you could n't even tell at which point they switched over from english to german in the dubbed version . 
  this is one of the few examples where dubbing is really a drawback . 
  what they sometimes do in this case , is to add a german accent to the lines ( bavarian , swabian , saxon ) to indicate that they are now talking even more `` german '' . 
  [ i present you the german django unchained trailer . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rjovdte2nk ), 
  well looking at all you comments in this thread it seems like you have a general repulsion towards the language . 
  you do realize that you just confirmed my point with your answer , do n't you ? 
  and no , those german titles are awful . 
  jesus christ , so watching a german movie must be really painful for you then . 
  dubbing is controversial in germany . 
  people tend to say that `` real '' movie fans should only watch movies in the original language ( good look with movies from asia ) as far as i am concerned i think that most of the german voice actors are so good that i am actually often disappointed when i hear the actors real voices ( interviews , talkshows ) . 
  so most of the times i start watching a movie in english , i get so annoyed by the unfamiliar voices i just switch back to german dubbing . 
  i like it better that way . 
  what * really * bugs me about foreign movies in germany is when they change the title of a movie to something completely different . 
  they even manage to replace an english title with another english title in some certain cases for no obvious reason . 
  examples : the good , the bad and the ugly -  ** `` 2 glorreiche halunken '' ** ( 2 glorious scoundrels ... . . * they got rid of the ugly somehow * ) liar !, 
  liar !, 
  -  ** `` der dummschw\u00e4tzer '' ** ( the twaddler ) once upon a time in the west -  ** `` spiel mit das lied von tod '' ** ( play me the song of death ) reservoir dogs -  ** `` reservoir dogs - wilde hunde '' ** ( reservoir dogs - wild dogs ... . . * why adding the extra `` wild dogs '' * ) black eagle -  ** `` red eagle '' ** ( * no comment * ) mo ' money -  ** `` mo ' money - meh ' geld '' ** ( mo ' money - mo ' money ... . . * what the actual ... * ) alien -  ** `` alien - das unheimliche wesen aus einer fremden welt '' ** ... . . * tl ; dr : alien * ), 
  to be fair it was still a better love story than twilight . 
  `` volksverhetzung '' is not limited to an ethnic group or minority ( gays , handicapped ) in germany . 
  considering germany 's past i think it 's quite understandable that there is a zero tolerance attitude in this particular case . 
  and zero tolerance for instance also includes holocaust denial or even displaying signs and symbols used by the nazis . 
  it might be silly for another country , but for me as german this is the right thing to do . 
  i really do n't feel oppressed by this . 
  i 'm saying that it is literally illegal to say things like that in germany , even on the internet . 
  the legal term for this is `` volksverhetzung '' . 
  if you get caught you can face up to five years in prison . 
  and yes , in this very issue it is a good thing . 
  blue ridge mountains , shenandoah river . 
  at least it sounds awesome . 
  ^ sorry , ^ ca n't ^ get ^ it ^ out ^ of ^ my ^ head ^ now, 
  in germany you 'd be liable to prosecution for this , you piece of shit . 
  this is how we roll .

  funny , i heard it 's almost heaven . 
  i can smell the pee in your pants from here . 
  at first i was looking for a black-red-gold flag . 
  now i feel stupid . 
  are you sure you would have to revoke ? 
  i could not find any information that would confirm this on the website of the us embassy in germany . 
  in fact , there are germans serving in the us army .

  in soviet russia space explores you . 
   i doubt it , if it has no ice and does n't touch the atmosphere then it wo n't create a trail or any light . 
  also applies to the moon , but you can still see it .
