  and those damn scots . 
  how dare they talking about independence in this situation , right ? 
  you once were an empire , dammit . 
  definitely some good reasons to feel a certain inferiority . 
  but then again just because it is ** your ** weird opinion does n't automatically make it the `` right thing '' , does it ? 
  dude , relax . 
  your inferiority complex really starts to show . 
   posters in / r/europe seem enamoured with the possibility of scottish secession , but seem somewhat defensive when it 's suggested that their own countries may be split asunder . 
  weird . 
  because gaining independence of once own accord by leaving a ** union ** ( the uk ) is the same as dismembering a ** country ** ( which is not going to happen for the next few centuries ) . 
  in your case not so well . 
  which probably still sounds sexy in french . 
  tourism is an insignificant factor to the german economy . 
  so yeah , thanks but we 're doing good . 
  because tourism is big business here in germany just like in italy . 
  agreed , please remove your flair . 
  they are n't allowed into space .

  i would trade kfc for taco bell anytime . 
  [ germany begs to differ ] ( http://www.kfc.de/ ), 
  [ at least you ca n't say we are picky ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/icule.jpg ), 
  you misspelled ally, 
  germany setting an example of stimulant austerity . 
  get your shit together spendthrift cokeheads !,

  some weird finnish hard rock band ? 
  i was seriously offended by that , too . 
  well , in that case there was probably a good reason why he was solo . 
  now i 'm feeling better , 
  you could have saved his day and have a beer with him . 
  you mean the short fuse ? 
  that 's unfortunate . 
  now that 's actually really sad . 
  i can imagine the italians exchanging looks with each other , irritated about that creep following them around and talking to them in english . 
   i 'm sure there are some who go alone and make great friends too . 
  maybe . 
  maybe . 
  if they are able to remember anything the next day . 
  i 'm down . 
  let it all out . 
  show us on the doll where the muslim touched you . 
  this made me sad . 
  well that 's just your ( valid ) opinion , but certainly no reliable source for that claim . 
  i was in turkey this summer and met multiple germans with turkish heritage working there . 
  every single one was complaining about little things in turkey i did n't even notice , and some of them could not wait to go back home after the holiday season . 
  so there is that . 
  well , yeah . 
  mommy , i was banned and can not get over it . 
  my life was ruined by a racist frog * that 's what i see . 
   i think all three of us are against general grievous i think he was n't too bad as a villain . 
  awful sword fighter , though . 
  no , silly . 
  rotting in the streets is illegal for hygienic and environmental reasons . 
  source ? 
  hey , it was n't saturday afternoon . 
  humor is n't allowed at any other time . 
  and still you replied by presenting statistical data without providing a source as if / u/theoryofjustice was being serious . 
  edit : also  yeah germans . . ech time you get clinged to a concept you 're taking it way overboard, 
  if you look closely , you might find a bit of irony in his post . 
  hint : he used generalization himself . 
  because making proposals is forbidden right ? 
  oh the horror , merkel made a proposal . 
  you lost . 
  but the salafists give them free korans . 
  what is not to like about them ? 
  the `` made in germany '' trademark today is mostly just an empty phrase . 
  because if you really start to look closely , the product `` made in germany '' should really be `` assembled in germany '' with parts made in china . 
  but that does not necessarily mean it 's bad quality . 
  that was surprisingly stupid and unfunny . 
  inb4 `` german detected '' . 
   in the gutter such drama . 
  much sad . 
  wow . 
  i knew it would be john cena before even clicking . 
  i should take a break from reddit . 
  oh , who am i kidding ... 
  yeah , unless she * knew * about it , and i highly doubt she did , she is still a bitch and was rightfully fired . 
   pretty sure a landmass ca n't run not with that attitude . 
  shots fired . 
  without eu funds i 'd suggest to go with the cheap kind . 
  lizard people confirmed . 
  facts ? 
  what fucking facts ? 
   the 4th reich and the people who elected it . 
   lol white guilt you 're a nazi that 's a fact for you . 
  going through your comments i think it 's pretty funny that a nazi like yourself talks about the 4th reich . 
  me neither . 
  who is `` they '' ? 
  way too much salt . 
  she 's in stable condition . 
  awesome . 
  and nothing of value was lost . 
  that link stays blue for a reason . 
  care to explain instead ? 
  no need to . 
  we made google and facebook our bitch , reddit should be a piece of cake . 
  upvoted for speaking the truth . 
  your points are coming back !,
