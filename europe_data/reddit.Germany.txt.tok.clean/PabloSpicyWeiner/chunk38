  aaaand there goes another of those precious virtual points . 
  ca n't say you did n't try . 
  i 'll give you an a for effort . 
  i ca n't imagine the chaos if germany had a shore at the mediterranean and the refugees did n't have to cross so many borders to get here . 
  thanks angela . 
  so much salt ... 
  so you are now basically saying what i already said in the beginning , thanks for clearing that up . 
  pro tip : next time you want to be a smart ass make sure you do n't come across so douchery by calling other people `` kid '' , when you know shit about the person you are talking to . 
  have a good one . 
  til moon landing do n't real , because i was n't there . 
  oh , what the hell , i 'll play along :  is intentionally deceiving someone lying ? 
  it 's pretty simple . 
  deceiving by ** not ** telling the truth is lying . 
  deceiving by telling the truth but leaving out essential information is manipulation . 
  you will get punished in court for the first but not necessarily for the second . 
  edit : kid . 
  stop worming your way out of this simple question , since you 've started the discussion . 
  if you are n't sure , because you have n't been there , open a newspaper or watch the news and you will find that the correct aswer to my question is : yes , there were women and children around . 
  ergo , the newspaper did not lie . 
  they just suggested wrong facts by leaving out essential information . 
  and as i 've already said it 's a shitty way of journalism but sadly this is not an uncommon practice . 
  i 'll try to make it even simpler for you : were there women and children around when they were using tear gas ? 
  just answer `` yes '' or `` no '' . 
  i 'm quoting my post below :  but that 's the point , it was n't false information . 
  it was withholding * essential * information to the point were the actual news content was reversed . 
  what they did was basically this :  ** hungarian police were using tear gas on ** ~ ~ violent refugees trying to break through the fence illegaly . 
  there were also ~ ~ ** women and children . 
  **  it 's not lying but very bad journalism . 
  mostly used by tabloids like the sun ( uk ) or the bild ( germany ), 
  but that 's the point , it was n't false information .

  yeah , no it 's not . 
  * a lot of people saw moving lights in the sky * ! = * ufos sighted *, 
  why buy a fake * syrian * passport and go through all the refugee trouble ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  just buy a german one and say `` guten tag '' when crossing the border . 
  suggesting wrong facts ! = lying it 's still awful journalism . 
  living the dream !, 
  like fingernails on a chalkboard ? 
  mila kunis talking russian is so fucking hot . 
  * what is tax ? 
  oh sch\u00e4uble do n't hurt me , do n't hurt me , no more * ftfy edit : downvote ? 
  why you hating on haddaway ? 
  this . 
  * please do n't let it be germanys fault this time , please do n't let it be germanys fault this time , please ... * ** oh , for fucks sake !, 
  he just wanted to show you that having idiots is n't limited to one particular country . 
   terrible german language  poland you should n't throw bricks when you live in a glass house . 
  you think so ? 
  they did n't even have a nazi reference and there is some truth to it . 
  merkels quick shot now bites her ass . 
  i 'm really starting to become more and more dissappointed with the way she handled that situation . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  you actually seem like a nice guy , so i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt and apologize for reacting a little to harsh to what you said . 
  so it would be totally unambiguous for me with my german flair to say `` we defeated the nazis '' because we are in / r/europe ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   i am not saying that we ( czechoslovaks ) defeated nazis well , then i would suggest you edit your comment to make that clear , because right now you are exactly saying that and that 's the only reason why i replied . 
   after we banned and destroyed their right wing dominance, 
  nothing measurable . 
  do n't be so salty , i 'm just giving you a history lesson here . 
  slovakia just switched sides , when shit started to get real . 
  your contribution to destroying the nazis should not be measurable . 
  afaik you basically just have to pull a sword from a stone . 
   after we banned and destroyed their right wing dominance  we  slovakia lol on september 1 , 1939 , national socialist germany invaded poland . 
  slovakia 's field army bernol\u00e1k , consisting of three infantry divisions and a mobile group , participated in the invasion and was subordinate to germany 's army group south . 
  the tripartite pact ( also called the three-power pact , the axis pact , the three-way pact or the tripartite treaty ) , an agreement signed in berlin ( germany ) on september 27 , 1940 , linked germany , italy and japan as the axis powers of world war ii . 
  on november 24 , 1940 , slovakia also signed the tripartite pact . 
  after a few months , [ when ? ], 
  hitler asked the newly-formed slovak republic ( independent from march 1939 ) to join the invasion of poland . 
  you are now being monitored by gchq . 
  so they are living the dream now . 
  i 'm happy for them . 
  he was talking about the bbc poll where people were asked about the most liked countries in the world . 
  when he came to the first place , he says `` and in first place ... germany . 
  no joke . '', 
  he is austrian . 
  and you know nothing about me . 
  so with all due respect , get lost . 
  you got some more of them lewandowskis ? 
  thanks , that procedure sounds pretty reasonable to me . 
  much better than `` open the borders and let them come '' . 
  at least from my current point of view . 
  she has multiple places to call home . 
  windsor , buckingham and balmoral being the most important ones . 
  everytime you say that , the queen cries . 
  do you want to make the queen cry ? 
  you had your chance . 
  literally mekka . 
  serious question , do you know from which camps the uk currently takes their refugees ? 
  i 'm starting to think that this is a much better way to deal with the refugee crisis , and i would like to know more about the procedure . 
  after all that shit i read on / r/europe lately , i 'm quite suprised about germany . 
  that 's bad . 
  the only choice given once they are safe ( and i 'm talking about refugees ) is wether they would like to stay where they are or not . 
  cherrypicking like that ( but i get more money if i keep going ) should n't be possible . 
  i 'm starting to think that the uk 's approach would be better for us , too . 
  build refugee camps there ( protected by joined european forces ) , and get those willing to accept these terms from those camps in a controlled manner . 
  other ways of entry should be forbidden .
