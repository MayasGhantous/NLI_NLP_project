  holy shit , do you even know him ? 
  that guy should n't be anywhere near a moderation button . 
  removing him was the best decision ever made . 
  i prefer something more catchier : starscream , lockdown , barricader or even megatron . 
  no , since it has no meaning it would be pretty useless . 
  i think we can skip that one . 
  wait , what ? 
  you approve military intervention in iraq , but at the same time you have no sympathy for those people that did the dirty work ? 
  how does this even compute ? 
  let me first look up the word `` feel '' . 
  even google offers no translation into german . 
  i 'm in . 
  welcome to the new / r/europe lebensraum . 
  do n't ask me , i 'm just telling you what you would have to deal with . 
  also nice way to talk about those good men that gave their life for this bullshit . 
  i 'm sure their families would be thrilled to read stuff like that . 
  are there any dank farage memes ? 
  notice : even the brits keep their headphones on . 
  and how exactly would you have done that without spending billions and billions of tax money ? 
  people at home were already raging about the costs and because of those dead soldiers that were sent back home in a wooden box every other week . 
  oh , come the fuck on , even most of your fellow countrymen [ admit that by now ] ( http://media.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr061013ii.gif ) . 
  at least we do n't try to whitewash our past mistakes and do n't take pride in them . 
  ca n't say the same for you , can i , mr. 
  i 'm - still-glad-we-invaded ? 
   emotionless machines of oppression i actually like that , too . 
  sounds like the decepticons . 
  implying germans have emotions . 
   is that what they teach you in germany ? 
  that 's hilarious . 
  is that not what they teach you in the us ? 
  that 's hardly surprising .

  * his comment, 
  not sure what you mean . 
  we were racist before it was cool . 
  but what about second breakfast ? 
  * filthy racist hobbitses . 
  we hates them , my precious !, 
  it 's absolutely ok for me to avoid any interaction with anybody feeling entitled to compare other humans to trash . 
  it would , but it 's not going to happen . 
  the shire , middleearth . 
  * guys chill . 
  it 's ok to call them human trash , just do n't focus on that , ok ? 
  since i started to check user histories , i am convinced that there is some sort of raid going on . 
  so many newbie accounts trying to stir up shit . 
  this reeks of organized , mostly brown , brigading . 
  good thing is that if it really starts to bother me , i am free to unsubscribe . 
  plenty of other subreddits to choose from . 
   he might have used some harsh language but the point stands . 
   all in all he 's right although his method of delivery is extremely crude . 
   he 's telling it like it is . 
  welfare grabbers out , hard-workers in . 
   poor choice of words , otherwise he was spot-on . 
   he 's right . 
  itt : `` refugees are trash '' is a bad choice of words , but it 's still spot on . 
  upvotes left and right . 
  / r/europe these days . 
   so germany can just decide what eu policies to follow ? 
  yes , we do * more * than we would have to according to dublin 2 . 
  instead of just sending them back , we register them here . 
   do other eu countries have this ability ? 
  yes . 
   doesnt seem like much of a union get lost . 
  feels bad man . 
   so what 's the problem ? 
  let 's do it quick .

  we have that technology , you know . 
  vinegar ~ ~ chips ~ ~ crisps are still the shit , if that matters . 
  i lived there , i watch american movies . 
  i 'm exposed to the american language so much that british english sounds strange to me . 
  so much salt ... 
  unlike your mom . 
  of all those flairs to choose from , you fucking chose the french flag . 
  that 's gold . 
  i guess you do n't have to study rocket science to become a paid shill . 
  he posted 2 articles including one to / r/ukipparty where he stated :  i come from an area in greater london that has been swamped with poles , lithuanians , and gypsies his other comments are just primitive brown grunting without any intend to discuss anything . 
  obvious shill was too obvious and got rightfully deleted . 
  i would have banned that bloke forever . 
  click on his [ profile ] ( https://np.reddit.com/user/enochwasaprophet ) and it becomes pretty clear that this 1 day old account was only made to push some agenda . 
  / r/europe seems to be swamped with stormfront shills lately , so it 's good someone tries to throw that brown shit back into the gutter where it belongs . . 
   [ example ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3juo66/woman_from_lesbos_talking_about_how_the_migration/?submit_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dc8x9oay_mo8&amp;already_submitted=true&amp;submit_title=test ) that 's actually a perfect example that he 's doing a good job . 
  thanks . 
  changed it . 
  her live is `` destroyed '' because they smell bad ? 
  drama much ? 
  if you have to ask yourself that question , seriously do n't come . 
  immigrants need to adapt to the country , they * chose * to emigrate to . 
  oh , the horror !, 
  what if i told you , that there are different opinions in a country with over 80 mil people and that people are free to change their mind ? 
  i totally agree with you on all the things you just said . 
  but as i said , dropping the human right of asylum is no option . 
  and i refuse to take shit for showing some humanity . 
  i think germany is acting right . 
  for now . 
  oh i 'm sure there are people trying to abuse the right of asylum , but that is something you can not prevent anyways . 
  best you can do is accept legal refugees , and investigate when there is doubt .
