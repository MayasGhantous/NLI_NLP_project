  i still do n't see how all this is germanys fault and i still do n't see any other proposals to deal with the situation . 
  closing the borders and stop accepting refugees is no option since it is a human right . 
  i 've seen those videos . 
  and what makes you so confident about the fact that they are immigrants and not refugees ? 
  or does this even make a difference for you ? 
  * we are dying , we are dying * lolwut ? 
  some people say germany wants to establish the third reich and we do not counter that , too . 
  maybe germany just does n't waste time commenting on bullshit ? 
  what germany is saying is that hungary should enforce the dublin regulation . 
  but even that seems to be a bit too much to ask for already . 
   because they 're the only one in eu saying everyone is welcomed nobody said anything like that . 
   mostly in german interest it 's in germanys interest to take in thousands of refugees , and give them food and shelter ? 
  how could that possibly be in our interest ? 
  it 's an act of humanity , and should be a no-brainer for every human being . 
  this is a concept that seems to be hard to understand for orban . 
   also blaming hungary because it 's politically and economically weaker is pretty fucked up . 
  sorry for not being as rich as the germans . 
  holy shit , we are literally only expecting you to let them pass through your country . 
  nothing . 
  else . 
  and all you do is whine about how they are fucking up your trains . 
  nice one , hungary . 
  you seem to be fine with getting help but have problems with giving help and somehow try to put the problem solely on germanys shoulders . 
  i 'm sure we could do your job for you , but at the same time i hope germany will not forget about your attitude , next time you are calling for our solidarity . 
  and this is germanys fault because ... find those that do n't have the right of asylum and send them back . 
  that 's what germany is doing . 
  or are you suggesting to drop that right , just because there are people trying to abuse it , close the borders and watch them die on tv ? 
  [ hungary is at the receiving end in the eu ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/europe/09/eu_budget_spending/img/graph_net_contrib_466x485.gif ) . 
  he is right , at least for germany . 
  solidarity works both ways . 
  the syrian refugee crisis was caused by germany ? 
  nice . 
  germany tries to alleviate this crisis by showing humanity first . 
  you get enough money from the eu . 
  make use of it . 
  muh trains !, 
  interesting point mr. orban , we 'll try to remember it next time hungary needs our help . 
  beta as fuck . 
  rules of nature ? 
  seriously dude ? 
  i really have no words ... 
  they way you write it sounds like they wake up one day and tell themselves `` hey , what a beautiful day , i should become a refugee '' . 
  they are forced to leave their home because they fear for their lives . 
  it 's not like the emmigration police knocks on their doors , and tells them their boat is waiting . 
  you have a responsibitly as a human being . 
  you were given rationality and compassion . 
  it 's your responsibility to make use of that in the best possible way . 
  so it 's better to close your eyes and stay in denial about the tragedy that is currently happening ? 
  i agree that those pictures are n't easily digested . 
  and they should not . 
  sometimes you have to scream at people to make them listen , and that 's what this picture does . 
  this is reality , and thoses people are so desperate , that they are forced leave their home and go on a journey that may cost their lives to a place they know nothing about . 
  if it still does n't pull on * your * emotions , it really tells more about yourself than anything else . 
  i 'm sure it still does for some of your fellow countrymen . 
  does n't matter . 
  saw boobs , 
  i was looking for a deeper message that i did n't get . 
  but it 's basically just a dramatic pause in a poor spelling . 
  so the 2 periods stand for the 2 shot reporters , and the missing one stands for the one that survived ? 
  fuck , i am really bad at this . 
   hitler 's castle , where hitler is buried sounds about right , but he 's not buried . 
  he ( or rather about 20 % of him , the rest are cybernetic implants ) lies in a hibernation chamber , waiting till we have the technology to bring him back . 
  i do n't get it , i give up . 
  checks out . 
  he may become the next tupac . 
  i 'm ok with that . 
   ellipsis huh ? 
  i 'm completely lost . 
  it 's not supposed to be the letter '' \u00d6 '' or `` o '' but an ellipsis ? 
   there could n't be a more great opportunity to emphasize the nationalities here . 
  yeah , execpt that did n't happen . 
  the article did not mention his nationality . 
  op felt the urge to add that information . 
  / r/pcmasterrace was right after all . 
  what 's with that strange use of the letter '' \u00d6 '' ? 
  it hurts my eyes . 
  if this is true , props to the uk media . 
  [ they had an unnecessarily long journey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhlquy1oz_m&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=23s )  istanbul to greece , greece to macedonia , macedonia to serbia , serbia to hungary , hungary to ** australia ** , ** australia ** to germany . 
  but it 's still hard work to make it grow on you . 
  i mean i could probably get used to the pain if i smash a hammer on my finger every day , too . 
  but why * would * i ? 
  just kidding , man . 
  there 's no accounting for taste . 
   czechs out . 
  last time i gave it a try it tasted like i was chewing on tree bark with a mouth full of toothpaste . 
  what the eff is wrong with you ? 
   licorice eeeeww , gross . 
  i will gladly trade that stuff for some warheads . 
  ^ ^ @nsa : ^ ^ the ^ ^ candies , ^ ^ not ^ ^ the ^ ^ ammunition . 
  maybe because he lives there ? 
  or he knows someone there to give his stuff to ? 
  yeah , but he did n't say `` bonn , the capital of germany , does n't follow suit '', 
   bonn hasnt heen the german capital in 25 years huh ? 
  who said it was ? 
   anabin  apprentice there must be a star wars joke in there somewhere, 
   fast food is real shitty i would kill for a good philly cheesesteak . 
  so there 's that . 
  pacific rim 2 confirmed . 
  featuring the new british jaeger `` maximum overgrumble '', 
  strange , it does work for me .
