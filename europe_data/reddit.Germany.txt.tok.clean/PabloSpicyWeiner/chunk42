  yes , because i voted for them . 
  i do n't think americans are too stupid or ignorant . 
  i think the majority indeed wants snowdens head , because they somehow personally feel betrayed by him . 
  if that 's conspiracy to you , then i 'm sorry to give you a reality check . 
  politicians will lie to you if it suits them . 
  all of them . 
  i 'm not even saying that obama planned to change his mind , but rather that his advisors urged him to do what the majority wants . 
   godwin 's law much does not apply to me . 
  i just checked my privilege . 
  politicans breaking promises after they are voted into power . 
  i am shocked . 
  there are reasons why obama broke his promise , and most likely because he was told that it would n't fly with the majority of americans to protect snowden . 
  the downvote was for `` no they did n't '' which is clearly wrong . 
  of course they did vote for their government . 
  if both parties agree on getting snowdens head on a silverplate , it 's still says a lot about the general mindset in this country . 
   i made no reference to ww2 and it 's irrelevant in this discussion . 
  true , i just applied your logic to this scenario . 
  and while you were complaining , you did not give your thoughts about this statement . 
  do you agree with it ? 
  so you are saying it was n't germans who were responsible for ww2 , but the german government ? 
  well , fuck me . 
   no they did n't . 
  til voting in the us do n't real . 
  it 's on the news . 
  which americans voted for . 
  latest news about the us in germany was the shooting of 2 reporters by an ex-coworker and the shooting on a campus in somewhereindo n'tremember , georgia . 
  and there was another shooting at a movie theatre some days ago . 
  tl ; dr : shootings going on in the us . 
  did n't you just identify him as a retard , too ? 
   i meant that you as a retard [ ... ]  takes one to know one . 
  ** deperately seeking for attention now that the minions got their own movie ... 
  works every time !, 
  well , this is awkward . 
  keep your stinking prussian claws away from our bavarian bros. . we 're like siamese twins . 
  you ca n't separate us . 
  and if we 're both leaving , you are fucked . 
  * we did n't start the fire * ... oh wait , we did . 
  but people told me there are a lot of trees in the netherlands ... 
  but i guess they meant * trees * not trees ( nudge , nudge ) . 
  as soon as i opened that picture the [ pirates of the caribbean ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrh-dzri4z4 ) theme started playing in my head . 
  awesome . 
  you are right , it 's not about diplomacy . 
  it 's about behaving like a total asshole and effectively commiting a crime under the protection of the german embassy . 
  this makes the whole country look bad , including myself . 
  that 's why i 'm kind of talking it personally . 
  i 'm not even kidding . 
  apologies to the ukraine for having to deal with this trash . 
  obviously our selection process has to be reviewed if people like that can make it into the diplomatic corps . 
   btw , german embassy already said that they are investigating . 
  source ? 
  no way . 
  want to bet ? 
   which is around 180 $ , that is more than the monthly income in most of the countries they come from you can not compare the value of 180 $ in syria and in germany . 
  commiting a crime and acting like an asshole under the protection of his diplomatic immunity ca n't possibly go well for him . 
  this just has to get enough attention . 
  as soon as he shoved his id into that cops face he officially acted as a representative of this country . 
  he could be angela merkels son and he would still be grilled by the public and the media here . 
  such behaviour is absolutely inacceptable and does n't fly well . 
  * dude this vodka do n't even real *, 
  good this went viral . 
  this drunk driving scumbag can kiss his precious diplomatic piece of plastic good-bye . 
  edit : since i still could n't find anything in the german news today , i just pointed some of the bigger news desks to this video : * zuschauerservice@prosieben.de ( pro7 / sat1 ) * redaktion@tagesschau.de ( ard ) * zuschauerredaktion@zdf.de ( zdf ) * rtl through their online contact form now we wait . 
  crosspost this to / r/gore and make sure you use the same title . 
  if they did the same with adidas tracksuits putin would have a civil war by now . 
  * fr\u00f6hlich edit : [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdtxg0wkggo ), 
  thanks . 
  according to google that 's about 6300 $ for anyone interested . 
  that kind of reminded me of the movie `` afflicted '' . 
  neat video . 
  how much did you pay for that whole trip , if i may ask ? 
  * no need to come over here , buddy . 
  you already have everything in las vegas . 
  [ looks like someone is ready for some free healthcare ] ( http://blog.berchtesgadener-land.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/steinadler-portrait.jpg ), 
  who would want to eat that crap ? 
  * rauschen * ( noise , static , rushing ), 
   not worf but who ? 
  data ? 
  geordi ? 
  riker ? 
  please do n't say wesley . 
  i know how to work around this ( proxytube plugin , ... ) but the fact that youtube blocks videos because of gema is annoying as fuck . 
  blocked youtube videos because of gema . 
   fuck spiegel for making hollande look even goofier than he actually is . 
  [ that 's ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-2411934-1b995fc6000005dc-384_306x423.jpg ) not too [ hard ] ( http://i1062.photobucket.com/albums/t498/theblueguerilla/francois-hollande-800.jpg~original ), 
  biggest letdown so far was probably burgas , bulgaria . 
  dirty , ugly and generally a place where i did not feel welcome . 
  and people , london ? 
  seriously ? 
  london is probably my second favourite place in europe , right after barcelona . 
  it might not be the prettiest place , but the mix of old historical and new futuristic buildings side by side does it for me . 
  also museums . 
  london has that special vibe , much like berlin . 
  would love to live there , if it was n't so expensive . 
  same shit , different assholes . 
  if this get 's through we are one step closer to gestapo 2.0 . 
  thanks , merkel !, 
  oh mama mia , mama mia , let me ** no . 
  you might have a piont here . 
  all articles i 've found so far mention the keylogging only in the technical preview . 
  if this is true and this feature will not make it into the official release , i might give w10 a try .
