  they are probably too busy running around like headless chicken trying to fix whatever problem they have right now . 
  i bet it 's that anonymous guy . 
  moot or whatever his name is . 
  happily married . 
  no need for those . 
  well , personally monitoring my keystrokes ( aka keylogging ) is where i draw the line . 
  windows 10 does that . 
  this is getting ridiculous . 
  what 's next ? 
  having a dedicated `` agent '' watch everything you do on his computer via remote managment ? 
   linux is n't a mass-market consumer product ... yet . 
  windows & google are really trying hard to make it one in the near future . 
  ca n't say i 'm too disappointed . 
  would you pay for a trojan ? 
  [ germany most likely will ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germany-france-to-jointly-develop-leopard-3-tank/a-18468270 ), 
  makes him even more alpha . 
  who ? 
  the same countries that buy high quality tanks like the leclerc and the leopard 2 . 
   the free french general immediately asked them why they wore a german uniform , to which one of them replied by asking the general why he wore an american one alpha as fuck . 
  i have yet to find a more pussified thing than the name daphne . 
   i feel that strongly about it i could shed blood now honestly . 
  you could shed some of those # to aviod this . 
  you should have offered him some ointment for that burn . 
  [ muh reputation ] ( http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/5/2/14/anigif_enhanced-buzz-20569-1367521176-1.gif ), 
  so , how does it feel losing to jamaica ? 
  that 's not bashing , that 's , sadly , nothing but the truth . 
  i would love to see [ sigmar gabriel ] ( http://polpix.sueddeutsche.com/bild/1.1781886.1380518832/640x360/sigmar-gabriel-spd.jpg ) as [ samwell tarly ] ( https://comeonhitme.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/samwell-tarly-930x523.jpg ), 
  or the iss . 
  it 's the old `` we spy , you spy , they spy , everyone spies '' attempt to justify that bullshit . 
  because it 's not british , french , not even russian or chinese , or any other country 's agency that ** gets caught ** acting like a enemy on a weekly basis . 
  you might want to take another look at the chart ... 
   we have only good feeling about french and britons * the nazi homo krauts can still go and fuck themselves :(, 
  next stop : stalingrad . 
  * yeah , but that was in a tank , and i did n't even have to get out *, 
  they do n't pay taxes ? 
  sue their asses into the stone age . 
  problem solved . 
  or is this yet another proof of germany 's perfidy because ~ ~ it 's a german company ~ ~ `` hochtief '' are german words ? 
  he 's prolly 20 % german . 
  judging by the eurovision votings , turkey would be in the top 3 for germany . 
  and because it 's a nice country . 
  but that erdogan guy ... seriously you should get rid of him . 
   will greece make enough money when they put up reforms ? 
  nobody knows . 
  the only thing we know right now is , that without reforms shit stays the same and this obviously does n't work . 
  so edgy . 
  hey , it 's the [ blue banana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ), 
   `` no , nicholas , '' the german chancellor is said to have replied , `` you are the head and legs . 
  i am the bank . '', 
  / rekt, 
  the title should be : most popular american fast food franchises . 
  the most popular fast food in germany would be the d\u00f6ner by far . 
  which is actually a good idea , when you were drinking too much cocktails the night before . 
  helps with the hangover . 
  probably . 
  i hope you are n't too dissappointed . 
  so that 's where all that * give germonizes plox * mentality comes from . 
  got it . 
  how would you have russia give up central europe without pressure from the us , uk and france ? 
  tsipras made a pinky promise . 
  for realz this time . 
  true , and just like germany greece put themselves into that situation . 
  and continue with the cold war a little longer ? 
  so blackmailing us to join a common currency by letting russia hold 16 million people hostage is totally acceptable to you ? 
   agreed to be in a currency [ * forced ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-price-of-unity-was-the-deutsche-mark-sacrificed-for-reunification-a-719940.html ), 
  i guess that backfired , moniseur mitterand . 
  honestly i stopped giving a shit about our `` reputation '' quite some time ago . 
  it 's probably the price you have to pay for standing in the front row . 
  [ and christiano ronaldo ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/zcablh5xcgef2/giphy.gif ), 
  i heard she even obtained a restraining order gainst him . 
  yeah , i 've seen some of those words before . 
  lame , you did n't even hit it . 
  worst.controlled.collison.ever . 
  the struggle is real . 
  it 's only funny in combination with his germany flair . 
  if it was n't for that it would just be the start for another circlejerk . 
  i doubt it . 
  check his history . 
   keep sucking that dick uk , you deserve it . 
  what a pathetic country . 
  he is a troll from trollistan . 
  and a boring one , too . 
  case closed . 
  he sure has the `` deal with it '' expression . 
  i 'm not sure if you are joking and at this point i am too afraid to ask ... 
  4th reich confirmed . 
  [ there is even a song about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55hcpt_pcgc ), 
  and it 's july , 14th , too . 
  i think not . 
  shut it , murica . 
  it 's ours , and we 'll call it whatever we want . 
  those sneaky nazi pigs and their dontbuygermanproducts campains on twitter .

  fun fact : lidl products are n't necessarily german .
