  granted it 's a little more complicated than that , but i do n't think i can make it any easier for you to understand . 
  which part of `` the gdr has nothing to do with the current federal republic of germany '' is so hard for you to understand ? 
  do n't you realize that by this logic the uk should be made responsible for the [ american indian genocide ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/american_indian_genocide ) are we seriously discussing how much gdr germany is ? 
  this just means it 's already happening !, 
  ^ ^ fuck , ^ ^ i ^ ^ thought ^ ^ [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qgbekao.png ) ^ ^ was ^ ^ the ^ ^ date . 
   that is there job after all * their and how could your own government handing over private data about it 's citizens to the us possibly be in your interest ? 
  [ lel ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/us-uk-secret-deal-surveillance-personal-data ), 
  there was n't much to ruin anyway . 
  what does germany `` of a kind '' even mean ? 
  a little germany , like what ? 
  the country we are talking about is the federal republic of germany ( frg ) . 
  the german democratic republic ( gdr ) is dead , and has as much to do with the frg as namibia . 
  except maybe for the fact that parts of the frg 's current territory was formerly gdr territory . 
  seriously mate , bringing up the stasi was n't a bright move . 
  the stasi was the gdrs intelligence agency , which was a different country and does n't exist anymore . 
  * europe without greece is like a party without your neighbour coming over , drinking all your stuff , and calling you a nazi the next morning because his hangover is totally your fault *, 
  spyception !, 
  it 's actually oprah . 
  hmm , i never thought about that , but it 's true . 
  some food for / r/showerthoughts / ? 
  i think it 's more of a `` well , fuck you , too '' . 
  i do n't expect any serious actions to be taken . 
  if there is anything i have learnt in the last few months it 's that the bnd is pretty useless without the nsa . 
  you mean they should ask the nsa to spy on themselves , and hand the results over to the bnd ? 
  sneaky . . 
  i 'd rather burn to death than freeze to death . 
  i might die in the next few days , but i will die with a smile on my face !, 
  i particularly like this part :  under the decision , us and british intelligence operations in germany will be subject to the same counter-espionage measures as those of russia , china and iran . 
  russia , china , iran , us and uk -  le nouveau axis of evil . 
  which kind of encryption algorithm exactly ? 
  i take this as a sign of quality . 
  tour buses ?? 
  yes , yes , of course . 
  tour buses . 
  carrying harmless tourists with fancy heckler & koch cameras . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ believe ^ ^ this ^ ^ actually ^ ^ works . 
  i 'll just mount it on my dutch bike and make * boom , boom * sounds on my way to dublin . 
  shame on you if you fool me once . 
  shame on me if you fool me twice . 
  flair up , so we know who to invade next . 
  edit : nevermind , i heard ireland is quite beautiful at this time of year . 
  wow , / u/shifty2o2 must be really old then . 
  / rekt, 
  alright but this time do n't mix up the beaches again . 
  it 's crimea , not normandy . 
  operation g\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung kann beginnen . 
  nobody said anything about `` evidence '' . 
  not even the linked article . 
  but here 's some german news for you : [ laut medienberichten verdichten sich auch die hinweise auf den ursprung : russland ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/bundestag-cyberattacke-101.html ) * according to media reports there are growing inidcations which point to russia as origin *, 
  the pot calling the kettle black . 
  sssssh . 
  let them jerk in peace . 
  is that a line from `` independence day '' , `` pacific rim '' or `` starship troopers '' ? 
  wait that does n't add up . 
  according to your fellow pole , we will be in poland while you will actually be the ones having to deal with the salafists here . 
  ... for now . 
   invade germany polands wet dream since 1939 ? 
   what do you think germany of 2015 would do against germany of 1944 ? 
  interesting thought . 
  leaving aside the improvements in technology past germany would probably kick present germany across the room like a football . 
  so there is n't much we could do . 
  yes . 
  and i fully expect the crowd to wave with baguettes with little flags attached to them next time the summit is in france . 
  i guess there is a the subliminal message here . 
  notice how some countries are closest and strongest allies , others are either only closest or only strongest . 
  or `` oldest '' for france . 
  let 's take a closer look : country | closest | strongest | other --------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- germany | 0 | 2 | 0 netherlands | 0 | 1 | 0 australia | 0 | 1 | 0 poland | 1 | 1 | 0 great britain | 1 | 1 | 0 korea | 0 | 1 | 0 israel | 0 | 1 | 0 france | 1 | 0 | `` oldest '' italy | 0 | 1 | 0 japan | 1 | 1 | 0 ** omg , why you hate us so much , obama ???? 
  thanks for your contribution , martinfacistschulz . 
  june . 
  ftfy . 
  well , who would have thunk ? 
   dr is no longer a mod of / r/europe dr `` i do n't agee with you , therefore you must be a nazi '' dr ? 
  about fucking time . 
  that guy should n't be anywhere near a moderating button . 
  afaik the only moderating troll on reddit . 
  robin hood intensifies . 
  worst booting speed ever . 
  next events : * russian nannies memorial buggy ride to berlin * russian farmers memorial harvester ride to berlin * russian kids memorial bobbycar ride to berlin * russian hipster memorial segway ride to berlin * russian tank battalion memorial ride to ber ... . waitaminute !, 
  alien infiltration confirmed . 
  why importing when you can build all the fancy stuff yourself ? 
   the us hahahaha . 
  the best they could do when we wanted to have access to our gold was to show us * some * gold . 
  not even ours , but it was gold . 
  probably . 
  island monkeys is really not that bad . 
  it mostly refers to football hooligans coming from the island . 
  and i 'm fine with krauts , too , no big deal . 
   because of cultural differences , brits respond differently to the expression `` island monkeys '' than germans do for example ... 
  but like so many things , this goes both ways . 
  germans or the ~ ~ frogs ~ ~ french do not respond so well when we are getting called `` huns/krauts '' ( nazis for extra points ) or `` frogs '' . 
  the uk media is n't fussy either when it comes to name calling . 
  they should n't be surprised and overly sensitive when this fires back from time to time . 
   i have no idea whether or not you agree with me that it will have an impact now will it have an impact : yes . 
  will it affect the outcome of the referendum : no , the impact is negligible . 
  are brits wearing funny hats , trinking tea the whole day , and does every household in the uk have a shrine where they are worshipping the queen ( and secretly another one in the basement for princess diana ) : hell , yes . 
  everyone knows that . 
  i understand that . 
  but what should reu make out of this then ? 
  mocking everyone else but not the brits ? 
  a british extrawurst if you will ?
