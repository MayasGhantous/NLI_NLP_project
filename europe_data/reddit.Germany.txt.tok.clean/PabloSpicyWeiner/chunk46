   i refuse to believe the outcome will be noticeably affected by things like that . 
   you did n't make this point from the beginning . 
  if your point from the beginning was that you disagreed on the impact , then it would have been helpful for you to have written it . 
  the rest of my inital `` so what '' post was a direct response to your statement that this will have an impact . 
  i thought that would have made it clear enough . 
  in my brain which runs a german os , the direct response should have been clear enough . 
  i apologize for that . 
  :(  in my mind the tone of the dialogue between the uk and the reu and the attitudes expressed by reuropeans ( as shown in this kind of video ) could make a significant impact . 
  agreed . 
  but this should not keep us from taking the piss out of each other without being sore instantly , no ? 
  you are actually proving my point : two people here were manipulated -  so what ? 
  that 's nothing compared to all those people in the uk that will never even know that this show exists . 
  i did n't say it does n't have an impact . 
  my whole point from the beginning is that this impact is probably negligible compared to the rest of the uk and those people that are not easily manipulated by harmless banter . 
  i actually do n't agree with you , see my edited post . 
  not strange at all . 
  you should re-read carefully what i wrote . 
  come on you can do it , if you 're really trying hard . 
  hint :  what i do n't care about is the constant `` threatening '' to leave because of things like that . 
  that 's the source for all `` so what `` s. comprende ? 
  let me make it even easier : t : * i did n't say that this show will make the uk leave the eu , but this kind of thing * p : '' * so what ? 
  * '' clear now ? 
   you seem to be agreeing with what i write no , i do n't agree . 
  i do n't think that the avarage brit is n't capable of understanding satire , and thus making descisions based on shit like that . 
  i 'm sure there are * some * but that would be a minority . 
  i 'm trusting brits will make a decision based on facts and weighing up the pros and cons, 
  oh , i 'm very interessted in the topic . 
  what i do n't care about is the constant `` threatening '' to leave because of things like that . 
  the banter will only get worse the more you complain . 
  i guarantee it . 
   so what ? 
  so what ? 
  things like that show will happen even more the more the uk talks about leaving . 
  if anything it 's a sign that in our minds we are already preparing for a brexit . 
   politicians and civil servants who deal with these things all day long know more about what they are doing than an elusive public . 
  are you serious ? 
  that would make sense if politicians and civil servants are experts and can always be trusted to make the right descisions . 
  they are not . 
  i mean how can a former `` expert '' in familiy affairs suddenly become the minister of defense ? 
   the average person [ ... ] ca n't possibly be more qualified to make difficult strategic decisions so you are saying the public should be treated as dumb voting cattle ? 
  why voting at all then ? 
  this is the basis for all further descisions made . 
  all descisions should always base on the public opinion . 
  this is the very definition of democracy . 
  you could make a great career in north korea with your attitude , though . 
  i for one am glad merkel actually gives a shit about public opinion . 
   she just waits for a public opinion to form and then does that aka . 
  democracy . 
  what a cunt . 
  you 're dumb .

  thanks , now i ca n't get it this song out of my head for the next few hours . 
   screw babies hey , we are n't belgium . 
   sadly germany being the strongest [ ... ] we need germany as friends not enemies . 
  sadly .

  wow , your father must be very rich . 
  fun fact : vienna 's academy of fine arts rejected him in 1907 and again in 1908 , citing `` unfitness for painting '' . 
  checkmate austria !, 
  it 's clearly your fault that he became a politician instead . 
  the paintings are n't that bad , too . 
  i doubt it .

  i 'm sure if the bbc would ask other businesses the same thing they would also `` stir up controversy '' by giving the bbc an answer .

  i heard heidi gave her a good tongue-lashing , too . 
  i would n't be too surprised . 
  god , i hate that bitch . 
   if they want to leave then they should be allowed to no need to `` allow '' anything . 
  it 's not like the uk would have to ask brussels for permission if they decided to leave . 
   honestly i do n't care as long as they make a choice , stick with it your post should have stopped at this point . 
   this is treason , big time agreed .
