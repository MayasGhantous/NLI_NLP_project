  have fun with your rice burner rip-offs . 
  that was a perfect eli5 . 
  thanks . 
  please forgive my ignorance , but [ this ] ( http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131207192541/disney/images/f/f0/the_little_mermaid_trident.jpg ) is the only thing that comes to mind when hearing trident . 
  care to eli5 ? 
  edit : nevermind , found the [ wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_trident_programme ) . 
  it 's about delivering nuclear weapons ... 
   we can wipe him out . 
  just to be clear , by `` we '' you mean nato , right ? 
  people should just add a `` hitler '' to their requests , and we will happily throw cash at them . 
  works every time . 
  lol , sorry for having to disappoint you sweetheart , but you can keep digging through my comments there is nothing that i would n't say in the context it was said . 
  actually no . 
  what has natos involvement in ukraine to do with russia trying to shatter `` german-american unity . '', 
  enlighten me . 
  i know what i wrote . 
  anything you want to tell me ? 
  really ? 
  ever heard of sarcasm ? 
  that was a sarcastic response to u/mshotts posts where he praises the efficenty of the us military in other countries . 
  9/11 or boston are the consequences . 
  and this is nothing but the truth . 
  how you can read that i said  the americans deserved 9/11 is beyond me . 
  damn , i knew it . 
  oh well thanks for the heads-up ... 
  are you a little slow on the uptake ? 
  show me the fucking post . 
  until then , i 'll tag you as `` lying cunt . 
  do n't bother answering '', 
  i 'd say 50/50 sounds about right . 
  and that 's after snowden . 
  before that it was probably around 80/20 in favor of the us . 
  whatevs . 
  i would say 90 % of your posts i see are about how evil those damn krauts are and how they are all a bunch of russia loving backstabbers . 
  it 's not even funny . 
  just look at your posting history . 
  if anything you have touched my godwin detector . 
  i admire the way you are trying to argue with a non-german ( ! ) . 
  please go on . 
  sure . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  where did i say something like that ? 
  still you are literally everywhere and feel the urge to complain about just that relationship you obviously see no benefit in . 
  just like a jealous girlfriend . 
  just look at your comment history , dude . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
   [ as an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving nazis or hitler approaches 1 '' [ 2 ] [ 3 ] -- that is , if an online discussion ( regardless of topic or scope ) goes on long enough , sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to hitler or nazism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law ) it 's not restricted to the word hitler . 
  source ? 
   germany 's fondness for russia . 
  implying there is such thing . 
  so really sound like a jealous girlfriend . 
  about time that someone invoked godwin 's law . 
  i was already starting to get a little disappointed . 
  could be right for the us . 
  german public opinion really went down the shitter only after the snowden revelations . 
  before that we mostly thought of you as being our pals . 
  time to move on and deal with it . 
  and act accordingly, 
  thank you for your contribution . 
   no , really . 
  it 's probably the same for the german-uk relationship . 
  you are closer than russia but not as close as most of the continentals . 
  the us is just so much more present in german tv , while news about the uk is mostly restricted to some royals visiting some country . 
  babys ... and children paying the price for adult stupidity . 
  hit me harder than i thought . 
  i wonder why . 
  according to the reddit hivemind they are obviously just ... ^ ^ wait ^ ^ for ^ ^ it ... ** sour krauts  **, 
   they 're also afraid and reluctant to take a lead in europe , because ~ ~ they might come across ~ ~ will be called `` evil krauts who want to take advantage of us again '' . 
  it 's already happening . 
  as long as russia acts all batshit crazy , i would say there is zero chance for any alliance in the foreseeable future . 
  quite the contrary the relations to russia have cooled off noticeably . 
  the shit that happened in the last few months did n't go down well with the german public . 
  and probably prevented any further cooperation with russia for years to come . 
  no we do n't . 
  that 's why the us is still closer than russia . 
  but that 's about it right now . 
  `` unity '' sounds like we are bros but we are n't . 
  we have way too many different opinions in multiple fields to call it `` unity '' . 
  we might have a unity with france or the netherlands but not with the us . 
  it 's really more of a business relation . 
  living the dream . 
  your wake-ups must be a nightmare . 
   germany has no army that can fight a war oh , come on . 
  yes , there are problems that need to be addressed , and the government actually just did that by drastically raise the military spending . 
  but that does n't mean that we have `` no army '' . 
  [ germany is ranked 8th place in the global firepower index 2015 ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) which is still higher than countries like canada , japan , israel or italy . 
  and if shit starts to hit the fan , i 'm sure our economy can be adapted quickly to that situation . 
  so rumors about the death of the german military are greatly exaggerated . 
  because no nato member was attacked . 
  article 5 does not provide for preemptive attacks . 
  and do you realize that if a nato member was attacked germany including myself will be out there , too and defend that country like it was my own ? 
  ever heard of nato ? 
  i 'm ok with the size of my balls , thanks for asking . 
  does being a romanian somehow exclude being a desktop hero ? 
  because you are talking like a desktop hero whose closest experience to being in a real war was when he discovered the multiplayer mode in cod . 
  yeah , that 's what i thought . 
  another desktop hero willing to pay with other peoples lives . 
  go back to your playstation , kiddo . 
  who knows maybe playing cod could teach you one or two things about war , but keep in mind : there is no respawning in real life . 
  war should always be the last option .
