  and next time do n't confuse willingness to negotiate with weakness . 
  yeah it 's good enough because it confirms that you have no clue what you are talking about . 
  negotiations are the only reasonable option in the current situation . 
  if it was n't for hollande and merkel , the situation in ukraine could have been much worse than it is right now . 
  how you can read  legitimizing and enabling russian aggression and warfare in europe seems to be what the eu wants and  literally trying to reward russian aggression from that is still beyond me . 
  but i 'm sure you have a better option to offer . 
  let 's hear about that . 
  preferably something that does not end in ww3 and in more dead ukrainians . 
   legitimizing and enabling russian aggression and warfare in europe seems to be what the eu wants source ? 
  oh , right . 
  you 're talking out of your ass .

  they better use them , or i want my money back . 
  and by `` use them '' i mean * not * trying to invade our neighbors again . 
  that must have been the cutest reaction in this thread . 
  have an upvote !, 
  damn colonists . 
  come back , the vaterland needs you . 
  we 're going on a journey again !, 
  wait till you see the plans for our jaegers [ ( classified ) ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/32/b5/df/32b5dfa8e1595e1d7a8b257f212190fb.jpg ), 
   german and french companies built the factories saddam used to manufacture the chemical weapons . 
  let 's face it . 
  the iraq war war about oil . 
  oil that the us wanted under their control . 
  nothing else . 
  wmd and all that bullshit were just made up to defend the invasion . 
  everybody knew that including france and germany . 
  with certainty also the uk but the puppy followed it 's master orders . 
  [ even your own people say that this war was a mistake ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/17/iraq-war-10-years-later/1993431/ ) . 
  it 's not even a secret anymore . 
  [ the un went as far as saying it was a violation of the u.n. charta ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/18/opinion/iraq-war-hans-blix/ ) . 
  i do n't think that the uk today would act the same way again . 
  you gave them a lot of dead soldiers and bad publicity . 
  that shit does n't work with france and germany and that 's why we did n't blindly follow the us into iraq . 
  we are n't your vassals and will never be . 
  the faster you accept this fact , the better for you . 
   it shows a complete lack of any manners , but it seems many people think it is completely ok to do to americans generalization much ? 
  you are literally projecting ** one ** persons action onto a whole country . 
  this alone should actually show enough of your mindset , and stop me from even responding to you but , meh , i 'm bored . 
  want to hear a little story about my experience with americans instead ? 
  when i was in the us i met a guy ( i think he was stoned , too ) , and he wanted to know where i came from . 
  trying not to make it too hard for him with actual city names that he probably never heard anyway , i just responded with `` i 'm from the same city as mercedes and porsche '' . 
  he nodded and said `` oh , i see . 
  you 're from detroit '' . 
   given the fact you are defending his actions , can i assume you do the same thing upon meeting americans ? 
  where did i defend * his specific * actions ? 
  either it never happened the way you are telling the story , and you probably made a similar remark about germany before , or that guy was a stupid douche . 
  but guess what : generalizing a whole country because of a single persons actions makes you a douche , too . 
  though my experience above nicely confirmed a stereotype about americans , i would never judge all americans on the basis of this pothead . 
  germans are just as entitled to comment on us history as americans feel entitled to comment on german history ( aka . 
  but i agree , always dropping the hiroshima bomb ( nice pun ) is a bit paint-by-numbers , when there are so many other things to choose from : [ us war crimes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_war_crimes ) ... [ using weapons of mass destruction against civilians ( aka . 
  coltarteral damage ) ] ( http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/whocares/popups/warcrimes.htm ) ... [ the us has refused to sign conventions against the development and use of chemical and biological weapons , and has either used or tested ( without informing the civilian populations ) ] ( http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/whocares/popups/warcrimes.htm ) so yeah , pretty funny to hear an american complaining about that when america is well known for gladly playing the hitler-card to defend their own wrongdoings . 
  it was well deserved after going full godwin mode . 
  first of all , how do you know that i am a descendant of anything ? 
  most likely because i have that little flag by my name . 
  must be a nazi child , right ? 
  ever heard of people becoming german after the nazis ? 
  awkward , is n't it ? 
  so go and shove all that up your ass . 
  secondly by bringing up hitler and the nazis in your very first post , you instantly invoked godwins law and i already knew where this is heading . 
  while you obviously still assume i 'm seriously discussing anything with a goober , i played you like a balalaika . 
  sadly i have to go now , so enjoy your hate , you fucking tool , while i enjoy driving my mercedes on the autobahn . 
  your individual opinion or values are irrelevant when we are talking about a countries values . 
  that 's generalization by definition . 
   does that mean eastern europe is unable to do the same ? 
  that 's not even about politics it 's about [ reading the news ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/26/poland-election-migrant-crisis-affecting-eu-politics.html ) . 
  stop acting so condescending . 
  are you really saying that the refugee crisis was ** not ** a major factor for the government change in poland ? 
   like i said i could have citizenship , i do not see any advantages in having refugee status . 
  so why are you using exact this argument to defend your point then ? 
  that was 2011 and it was a stupid statement . 
  germany is now `` being swamped '' because the government changed it 's policy in the meantime and made it a european problem . 
  does that mean eastern europe is unable to do the same ? 
   decision is binding . 
  too bad is n't it ? 
  does n't make my point invalid , though . 
   and if you would know anything about polish politics you would know that pis was ahead way before quotas were introduced . 
  because poles were already worried about all those brown people coming from all over the middle east long before quotas were introduced . 
   share culture hardly . 
  this becomes pretty obvious by now . 
  so you are salty because ee countries are declared safe countries , and you can not get refugee status in germany like those people whose lives are actually in danger . 
  because that 's bascially what you just said . 
  minus the `` salty '' thing maybe , but that was n't too hard to guess if you get the context . 
   we have to do on our own you fucked with russia on your own . 
  play stupid games , get stupid prices . 
   perhaps we should have started with wrecking havoc on half of the continent hahahaha , get back to reality , man . 
  you would have been stopped at the polish border instantly . 
  ukraine dreaming of wrecking havoc . 
  my sides just left the orbit . 
  nice backpedalling there , buddy . 
  just confirms my impression of eastern european hypocrisy . 
   how is life in post-nazism country ? 
  like everywhere it has it 's good and bad aspects but over all it 's actually pretty awesome .
