  how about the ukraine ? 
  last thing i heard people hated it so much they decided to be russian again . 
  agreed , eastern europeans often seem to confuse the eu for being some kind of welfare organisation founded solely to please their demands , instead of a union with rights and obligations . 
  the former government did that . 
  or did you miss the recent change of government ? 
  probably one of the main reasons why they had to go , too . 
  get * your * facts straight , buddy . 
  so you actually love living here ? 
  is that what you are saying ? 
  germany must be doing * something * right then . 
   post-communist shithole mindset that does n't even make sense anymore . 
   i do n't complain about germany . 
   too bad i actually live in germany now that 's complaining in my books . 
  while enjoying the benefits of living in a western country . 
  so why do n't you actually fuck off ? 
  you have n't answered that yet . 
  do you hate it so much that you just do n't want to leave ? 
   germans see it that way then it is time to party our ways . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  this union in it 's current form is just one big mess . 
  letting ee in in the first place was the biggest mistake . 
  it 's pretty clear we do n't share the same values and we do n't have much in common . 
  it 's funny how ee constantly demands solidarity only when it benefits them . 
  but when it 's their turn to show solidarity , like accepting refugee quotas , it 's suddenly the eu blackmailing them . 
  because you obviously rather like to focus on germany 's idiot politicians . 
  [ he is even a member of the european parliament ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janusz_korwin-mikke ) . 
  there is also a polish article :  pose\u0142 na sejm i kadencji , deputowany do parlamentu europejskiego viii kadencji according to your logic he represents poland there by saying things like russia is polands friend and ukraine and germany are it 's enemies . 
  oh , and he occasionally likes to do the hitler salute , too . 
  my article states the current german policy . 
  and if gabriels private opinion , as he clearly said , somehow represents germanys policies , then let 's talk about [ janusz korwin-mikke ] ( http://linkis.com/fhmzv ), 
  no , he does n't , that why he 's the ** vice ** chancellor , especially when he cleary says it 's his private opinion . 
  if everything stupid a politican says and does would be taken as the official position of his respective country , we would be having ww3 by now . 
  gabriel has no problem calling people attending a legal protest `` pack '' . 
  also hard to believe it 's his private opinion ? 
  he 's just a putin loving comrade with zero chances to become chancellor . 
  he 's probably just preparing for his future position as a gazprom board member . 
  no `` maintain '' is the keyword until the official policy changes . 
  also did you downvote me ? 
   suggests ... which means in other words : we are making assumtions and suggestions , and ... * wooosh * ... they are now a fact . 
  however , another fact is that germany [ was pushing to implement sanctions on russia ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_germany_leads_the_eu_on_russia_sanctions311313 ) and to [ maintain them ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/06/07/g7-summit-germany/28638255/ ), 
  * slow clap *, 
  tl ; dr : i sucked at music , that 's why i became a terrorist . 
  well , no shit . 
  put a paper bag over their heads . 
  problem solved . 
  * waves hand * i 'm not the terrorist you 're looking for . 
  fun fact : he is german . 
  awkward , is n't it ? 
  because it might turn out to be a bad investment . 
  ah , a general judgement of 80 million people based on a sarcastic comment of one person , which may or may not even be german . 
  bonus points for including ww2 references . 
  congratulations , you are using the same technique like the nazis . 
  only less subtle . 
  i hope those `` make business with poland plox '' commercials were n't too expensive . 
  turkey just seems to be today 's topic for the daily `` fuck merkel '' circlejerk . 
  do n't worry . 
   treat meat eaters like smokers . 
  cough in their general direction ? 
   the phrase refers to the gesture of tipping one 's hat as an expression of recognition or acknowledgement between two persons now pay debts . 
  gib monies plox !, 
  \u266a \u266c * up on the shore they work all day * * out in the sun they slave away * * while we devotin ' * * full time to floatin ' * * under the sea * \u266c \u266a, 
  turkey . 
  the ... umm ... blue part of england ? 
  til . 
  it 's probably a regional thing . 
  there were no playstations in 1939 so no . 
  [ wikipedia has a more realistic number ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_poland )  germany : [ note 2 ]  16,343 killed ,  3,500 missing , [ 11 ]  30,300 wounded even if you add up all the casualties the number is still not even close to what you claim : germany/slovakia/soviet union : 59,000 poland : 199,700 = 258,700 total casualties where did you get that 450,000 number from ? 
  well , i for one am more looking forward to his book `` mein comb '' with lot 's of awesome instructions how to get this badass side parting . 
  since the word `` kamp '' does n't exist in german , i do n't know what to expect from a book with that title . 
  but the book is so much better . 
  you clearly are no real fan unless you have read the book !, 
   mein kamp i think you might be messing things up here . 
  `` mein camp '' is the sequel written from the perspective of rudolf h\u00f6\u00df , the camp commander in auschwitz . 
  sooo how do you feel about the 7-1 thing last summer ? 
  i was joking , too , mate . 
  vw is in big trouble here in germany , too . 
  the problem is not limited to cars in the us . 
  i still do n't get it . 
  obviously vw just wanted to satisfy the us market where [ coal rollers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1pbgwowkeq ) are a thing . 
  not the hero we need but the one we deserve . 
  and by `` people '' you naturally mean reddit , not the people in germany . 
  because it 's much more important what reddit says , not those actually responsible . 
  my bad . 
   germany is found to be doing it and not a peep . 
  this is the bullshit you are spreading . 
  it 's all over the news here today . 
  trust a french to not get the joke . 
  not without a mandate from the government . 
  what they did was likely illegal . 
  and in that case , there should be consequences . 
  the bnd does not stand above the law . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  the bnd did this without a mandate from the government . 
  there will be a legal investigation . 
  not a peep ? 
  since the bnd did this without a mandate , there will be an investigation . 
   the latest disclosures , however , might imply that the bnd added its own choice of selectors to the list - an act which would fall outside its constitutional mandate and qualify as illegal . 
  the bnd is already under scrutiny for the legalities of doing the groundwork for a foreign spy agency by collaborating with the nsa . 
   the parliamentary control panel said it would travel to the headquarters of the bnd , in pullach near munich , next week to investigate the search terms involved in the selectors and to speak with bnd employees directly to try to establish the nature of those selectors . 
  it 's right there in the article .
