  it 's a plea to stick with your own legal system . 
  eye for an eye would involve raping and killing him . 
  but if that 's `` eye '' for an `` eye '' mentality to you , you should let your own government know about your concerns . 
  furthermore you are comparing the pain his victims suffered with the `` pain '' he suffers through your legal system . 
  not only is this ridiculous , it 's disrespectful to the families that lost their loved ones to this man . 
  he is a rapist and a killer . 
  well deserved , if you ask me . 
  what do you mean ? 
  he wants to kill himself and got the permission to get professional aid for doing so . 
  did mr. van den bleeken allow his 19-year old victim to kill herself before raping her and killing her ? 
  that 's what i thought . 
  sitting in jail is his * punishment * for the crimes he committed . 
  since when is suicide an acceptable way to avoid punishment ? 
  he can kill himself all he wants * after * serving his sentence . 
  edit : downvoting because i do n't feel pity for a convicted killer and rapist , i see . 
  i hope you people have the same empathy for his victims and their families . 
  why lock him up in the first place then ? 
  jail is supposed to make him feel miserable , that 's why it 's called punishment .

  what can i do for you ?

  i 'm not stupid , you know .

  same analysts believe that the us may even send [ iron man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77pnvflkujm ) to defend ukrainian territory . 
  dude , it 's hugo boss . 
  do you have an idea how much i payed for that hat ? 
   analysts say  several experts can picture ...  several analysts said ...  and some analysts believe ... 
  they may or may not . 
  who the fuck knows . 
  and i do n't need some unspecified analysts to tell me that . 
  this is non news . 
  europe . 
  so we are n't the baddies this time ? 
  brb , shaving my stache . 
  thanks . 
  that 's what i thought , too . 
  and there is really no need to change it , except for annoying the scots if they leave . 
  from a marketing point of view it 's like changing a successful logo . 
  what is ruk ? 
  i 've seen it already but thought that was just a typo ... 
  i was referencing to the video where they mentioned it . 
  i 'm sure it 's not going to happen , but if scotland decided to leave , and the uk would really change it 's flag and remove the scottish part , the following countries/states would probably also have to change their flags : * anguilla * australia * bermuda * british columbia , canada * cayman islands * fiji * hawaii , usa * manitoba , canada * montserrat * new zealand * niue * ontario , canada * tuvalu [ source ] ( http://www.enchantedlearning.com/geography/flags/uklike.shtml ), 
  10/10 would refugee again !, 
  do you have a link ? 
  sounds interesting to me , too . 
  ironically it brought england and france closer together instead . 
  and we fucked up relations to pretty much everyone else on this planet not only england . 
  what can i say , you can not change history , and it is like it is now . 
  all we can do is learn from it and try to make it better in the future . 
  who knows , maybe one day england and germany will remember their heritage and will be able to move on and become the brothers they should have been . 
   i do n't think we secretly wish we were n't related . 
  you are right , maybe i should skip that part . 
  i like your interpretation better and it 's closer to what i had in mind . 
  oddly enough i think we are closer to england than to france in terms of kinship . 
  without the wars we would have been very natural allies . 
  but since there is now a certain level of mistrust on both sides , we are more like 2 brothers that only come together for family meetings but apart from that we tend to ignore each other ~ ~ and secretly wish we were n't related . ~ ~ if i had to pick a `` relative '' we admire , it would be the netherlands . 
  they were a pain in the ass not so long ago , but since then they got much more mature , and now we really enjoy hanging out with them . 
  i 'm no lawyer , so i honestly ca n't tell you . 
  but i even if it was , i do n't think a state prosecutor would bother to start a lawsuit over a trifle like that . 
  if you added a sentence like * '' [ evil image ] sign in today we have virgins . 
  and cookies '' * , the legal situation might look different . 
  `` das internet is kein rechtsfreier raum '' * `` the internet is no legal black hole '' * i could be treated equally to nazi symbols . 
  it 's legal for educational or artistic purposes . 
  otherwise it 's illegal . 
  might be a little too late for germany . 
  there are already plenty of streaming services to choose from . 
  so unless they have something to offer that the others have n't , or their price is significantly lower , i see no reason why people would choose netflix over another provider . 
  on the other hand it will put more pressure on the existing market and the prices ... so i , for one , welcome our new streaming overlords . 
  good . 
  edit : i hope the sangria police will still be legal after that !? 
  i like sangria . 
  unless you were buying a 10 year old printer there is no way a printer would be sold without a matching windows 8 driver here . 
  customers would come back 30 minutes later and slam that thing on your counter demanding to get their money back . 
  i had the same experiences the other way round . 
  no drivers for linux ( except for ~ ~ nvidia ~ ~ ati , which has a pretty good linux support ) . 
  using generic drivers * might * work , but in most cases you are missing certain features of your hardware ( low ink alarm ) . 
  an adult and well worded response , my friend . 
  i see nothing wrong about that . 
  by profit i was thinking of energy profit more than economical profit . 
  but i agree with you . 
  but as long as you can get more energy out than you put in , you are still making profit , right ? 
  i understand that it is * currently * still cheaper to drill a hole but as we all know that resource is limited . 
  i guess i just did nazi that coming ... anne frankly i rather expected some lame flatulence jokes . 
  holocaust jokes are really out of mein kampfort zone so i hope these kind of puns will not go on any f\u00fchrer . 
  just do n't give them the root password , and you should be fine !, 
  it was a ubuntu 12 , so yes . 
  you monster !,

  we are * exporting * gas ? 
  they 'll bring back windows in a few years . 
  i guarantee it . 
  edit : after munich did the same in 2004 they are now currently discussing to go back to windows . 
  working in it myself and using all different linux and unix os everyday ( including suse , redhat , debian , ubuntu , solaris , hp-ux and aix ) , i always came back to windows at home .
