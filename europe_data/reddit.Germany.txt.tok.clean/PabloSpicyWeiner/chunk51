  an article from 2014 for a version that was patched mutliple times since then followed by 2 results that explain why it 's so hard to track tor users . 
  good job , i 'm still not convinced . 
  also linking to `` let me google that for you '' instead of just the google results just makes you look condescending and not witty . 
  tails today is proven to be safe if you are using it like it should be used . 
  google that . 
  snowden used it . 
  if you are accepting every cookie and turn on full scripting , not even tails can guarantee your anonymity . 
  as long as they get deported right afterwards , that 's fine with me . 
  [ i 'll just leave this here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/tails_ ( linux-distribution \\ ) ), 
  thanks , i 'll quote your post for someone else that tried to rub the constitution into my face to prove that i 'm wrong . 
  there you go , trust a brition to find the backdoor . 
   i 'm really starting to like you guys . 
   they have a right to apply for asylum guaranteed by the constitution . 
  they have a right to apply . 
  and they have obligations that come with this right . 
  you fail to follow the obligations , you lose the rights , too . 
  and i know what the constitutions says , no need to act all condescending , thanks . 
  i 'm saying what * should * be done in * my opinion * . 
  edit : [ / u/thett found the law i was looking for and , surprise , it 's an actual law . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3n30nv/clash_breaks_out_among_refugees_in_hamburg_police/cvkg74z ), 
  it 's basically just another type of browser , nothing more . 
  it 's really not that complicated and does n't affect my daily internet browsing at all . 
  i still use regular browsers like chrome , ie or firefox for everyday stuff , but i use them as if someone was sitting behind me watching . 
  and i do n't use both simultaniously . 
  as long as people do n't care enough about their privacy i ca n't see a rebellion in the next few years . 
  germans actually do give one or two shits about their privacy , see the whole nsa affair . 
  but when i tell them they should start by installing linux and drop windows , they suddendly become very tame . 
  so no i do n't see a rebellion in the near future . 
   normally starting a fight results in what but they are n't in a normal situation . 
  they are in limbo between being accepted here or not . 
  behaving themselves and not causing trouble is the least i would expect from a guest . 
  they are applying for asylum , germany did n't ask them to apply . 
  if you are asking someone to help you , do n't piss into his beer . 
   for a refugee , who is an actual refugee , fleeing his country for fear of his life , deportation is essentially a death sentence . 
  so starting a fight over some bullshit would n't be worth the risk if you are facing deportation , right ? 
  they can not watch me when i 'm using tor . 
  well , they can probably see that i 'm connected to the tor network , but that 's about it . 
  they can not track or monitor , what i 'm doing exactly . 
  unless i 'm opening some kind of backdoor , of course . 
   that 's what should happen . 
  now that escalated quickly . 
   their asylum claim must be processed first . 
  that 's the point . 
  failing to behave while you 're not even granted asylum should result in immediate rejection and deportation . 
  it 's a simple message really : do n't be an idiot and risk your life coming here , just to lose everything because someone said something bad about your mother . 
  no more . 
  i adjusted the way i surf the interwebs and always act as if someone was standing behind me watching . 
  this includes e-mails and banking . 
  for all other things there is tor . 
  so what happens to those responsible ? 
  deportation without a chance to re-apply for asylum ? 
  because that 's what should happen . 
  edit : germany * could * do exactly that according to article 33 section 2 of the 1951 [ geneva refugee convention ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html ) . 
   the benefit of the present provision may not , however , be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is , or who , having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime , constitutes a danger to the community of that country . 
  do n't you have someone you can surrender to ? 
   i would love to read that wikipedia link , but unfortunately , it 's in german , and i do n't read german . 
  because it 's ugly . 
  if you read it aloud it sounds like two angry dogs fighting over a broken harmonica . 
  ich hoffe du bist wegen deiner [ schizophrenie ] ( http://de.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12m0x0/britain_has_invaded_all_but_22_countries_in_the/c6wpce8 ) in behandlung i hope you are getting help with that [ schizophrenia ] ( http://de.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12m0x0/britain_has_invaded_all_but_22_countries_in_the/c6wpce8 ), 
  admit it : you were butthurt , when i confronted you with the fact that britan has german ( ic ) roots , which made you go from zero to `` hitler , hitler , gas chamber '' in 5 minutes . 
  just wanted to put your comment above in the right context , mate . 
  practise what you preach . 
  you are such a little bigot , are n't you . 
  claiming that bringing up hitler out of nowhere is retarded while [ doing it yourself ] ( http://de.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12m0x0/britain_has_invaded_all_but_22_countries_in_the/c6wnrzq ) . 
  ** french ** guiana . 
  exactly my thoughts . 
  felt like a mix of `` star wars '' , `` the downfall '' and `` dumb and dumber '' . 
  julia dietze was freaking hot though . 
  ... using our flying saucers that are currently hidden on the dark side of the moon . 
  take that , logic , 
   you seem quite keen on trying to start a pissing ~ ~ match ~ ~ war . 
  germans are starting ** wars ** for gods sake . 
  not quite . 
  i did n't manage to throw in some out of context references to ww2 . 
  a german opt-out ?? 
  how dare these dirty krauts !, 
  yadda-yadda-yadda , we 're nice , you 're kinda nice . 
  let 's kiss . 
  * world 's smallest violin plays somewhere off in the distance . 
  same source :  this pioneering work , while constantly cited , has invoked little serious discussion and less outright acceptance . 
  and when we are asked to take leadership in this crisis and we are trying to find ways out of this mess , people start calling us nazis and fear for the `` 4th reich '' so , yeah , tell me more about how unfair you are treated . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_democracy#mesopotamia ) footnotes : bailkey , 1967 , pp . 
  1211 -- 1236 sharma 1968 , pp . 
  no need to apologize . 
  that was hardly a surprise . 
  at least it is your honest opinion and not some british beating around the bush . 
  and you are doing a great job in keeping us down . 
  not . 
  mesopotamia was * `` rather a power struggle between primitive monarchs and the nobility '' * whereas in india * `` the lack of the concept of citizen equality across caste system boundaries lead many scholars to believe that the true nature of ganas and sanghas would not be comparable to that of truly democratic institutions '' * . 
  so , no . 
  i 'm pretty sure you have already heard about greece . 
  it 's that funny shaped country in the southeastern part of the european continent well known for excellent food , debts but most of all as the birthplace of democracy . 
  in fact the word democracy is made of the two greek words \u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ( d\u00eamos ) `` people '' and \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ( kratos ) `` power '' . 
  now let 's hear your theory . 
  leave the uk alone . 
  the eu could gain a lot more flexibility and agility without the back seat driver trying to give directions all the time and hitting the brakes whenever possible . 
  it seems like they are more of an obstacle than a support for the eu anyway , leaving them out sounds like it 's definitely worth a try . 
   the birth place of fascism and stalinism and democracy . 
  and football .
