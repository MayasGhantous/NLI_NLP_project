  one million times this . 
  god , i hope my state will not be that stupid . 
   the chairman of the central council of german sinti and roma , ** romani rose ** gnihihihihihi, 
  and if counseling surprisingly does not work ? 
  more counseling ? 
  more money to pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top follow the fucking laws in germany ? 
  why hire expensive `` counselors '' , when there already are regulations for not following the law ? 
  i 'm afraid you are just dreaming some do-gooders wet dream which in reality will cause way more problems with the german population than you might imagine . 
  the jugendamt sends the police to pick up the children at home and escorts them to school ( like in `` forcing them to go to school '' ) . 
  what you are asking for is something completely different . 
  the cultural gap is one thing people should expect when moving to another country . 
  this is common sense . 
  they can not expect is to have their own laws and regulations here and to be treated differently . 
  either you are willing to except the laws and conditions in germany , which you should know beforehand , then you are welcome . 
  if not , you better stay where you are . 
  so why not hire german counselors for those non-sinties , that are refusing to send their children to school ? 
  where is the equality in your scenario ? 
  sinties are to be treated differently to germans when applying simple laws and regulations because of what ? 
  the war that ended over half a century ago ? 
  are you serious ? 
  do n't you fucking understand that your scenario would raise reluctance in the german population against the sinti , because they would feel discriminated in their own country ? 
  is that the kind of integration you are dreaming about ? 
  i 'm afraid this would cause way more problems than you might imagine . 
  i really do n't know what marshall plan you are talking about ( rebuilding palestine ? 
  ) , but the bottom line is : applying laws depending on you skin color or nationality is an act of racism . 
  this is plain bullshit . 
  same argument can be applied to make a fucking parking lot out of palestine , because it is threatening israel . 
  no laws are applicable that would prevent us from doing so . 
  if they want to live here ( like in `` not forced to live here '' ) , and be part of our society with all its benefits , they should better also follow the rules/laws that apply to every person living in germany . 
  if sending your children to school is mandatory ( like in `` the law '' ) here in germany , they should send them to school . 
  otherwise they are free to go to wherever this act of cruelty is not forced upon them . 
  it 's not like we wo n't let them go . 
  laws must be applied independently of nationality or skin color . 
  everything else would be racist , would n't it ? 
  do i know you ? 
  considering the fact that this comes from a brit , it 's even funnier . 
   so a crowd portrays you as hitler and so you 're right in following whatever policies you 're following just because ~ ~ said crowd portrayed you as hitler ~ ~ you still believe it is the right thing to do . 
  ftfy, 
  we have nothing to hide . 
  the chinese are a bunch of dishonorable , stealing , backstabbing ~ ~ faggots ~ ~ commie bastards . 
  they are the greatest threat to world peace nowadays . 
  why the chinese , they are not even european , you say ? 
  because fuck them , that 's why . 
   why do the dutch catch so much flack ? 
  for germany it is because of [ frank rijkaard ] ( http://www.tz-online.de/bilder/2012/06/11/2350031/724814381-rijl-s09.jpg ) . 
  mandatory upvote for assassins creed 3 reference !, 
  my apologies !, 
  you do care , since you bothered answering . 
  trust me , as a german i get a lot of shit to be offended about here in r/europe , too . 
  so i kinda feel your pain . 
  hence my advice : brush it off , because 99 % of all the bullshit you get is not even worth the time reading , let alone answering . 
  let me reassure you that my comment was just bantering and in no way to be taken seriously . 
  wait , wait , wait i got this !, 
  paris ? 
  it was just a joke , given that both results were published yesterday . 
  whatever that other moron said is clearly a bad attempt to troll you . 
  just brush it off . 
  honestly , i would never say that the coronation of a king by some tribe on the other side of the planet could in any way have the same impact than these eagerly awaited poll results here in r/europe . ^ yes , ^ that ^ was ^ a ^ joke , ^ too . 
  ^ i ^ should ^ just ^ stop ^ and ^ accept ^ the ^ fact ^ that ^ i ^ am ^ german . 
  ^ germany ^ can not ^ into ^ funny . 
  great job , dude !, 
  but you might want to change  least favourite country apart from your own : to * most * favourite country apart from your own :, 
  that 's what i call a voting result !, 
  in your face murica !, 
  also the general view on europe is surprisingly positive . 
  great , so the whimpire can stop complaining about how germany gets to play with all the toys now ? 
  awesome . 
  why ? 
  i do n't see why weaker relations between germany and the us should help the eu as a whole . 
  you misspelled `` pay '' . 
  i think that might depend a little on where you are from . 
  in some cities including new york there are even annual `` steuben parades '' . 
  in fact i only learned about steuben from my time in the us . 
  never heard of him before that either . 
  granted he may not be famous like lafayette , but from my experience people do know him . 
  as germany clearly [ supports obama and opposes romney ] ( http://www.opendemocracy.net/brigitte-weiffen/germany-europe-and-presidential-election ) , it 's a just matter of how effective the partnership with the us will be in the next 4 years . 
  a relapse to `` old europe '' - bush times would affect the german relationship to the us noticeably . 
  but apart from that , little is at stake . 
  trust me , back-in-black is not as entertaining as it seems . 
  he switches over to `` hitler , hitler , gas chamber '' bawling pretty fast . 
  well , as this thread is an answer to one of my posts i naturally get notifications . 
  and look what i found : a heavy backpedaling back-in-black . 
  this is much more entertaining than the sad appearance you gave in the other thread . 
  congratulations on finding the english wiki article , by the way . 
  i knew you could do it . 
  yeah still bored , but still not ready to give up my faith in you . 
  as i said , this subreddit is about the british massacres back in the good old days . 
  no need to steal your show . 
  so come at me , bro . 
  you can do better . 
  give me all you have . 
  or are you waiting for an american or russian to step in for you ? 
  what do you think was the most interesting part ? 
  the part where he killed redcoats by the dozen ? 
  or the part where he became an american national hero for killing redcoats by the dozen ? 
  dude , is this all you have left ? 
  did i take the wind out of your sails with mentioning the unshaved women and the sunbeds ? 
  my apologies . 
  as i said , try harder and you will find something else . 
  `` pablospicyweiner smells like pee-pee '' or something like that .
