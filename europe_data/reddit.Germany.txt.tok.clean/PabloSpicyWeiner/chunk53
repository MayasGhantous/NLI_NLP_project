  if by hurting you mean bored , then yes . 
  listen pal , this subreddit is about the british , i repeat b-r-i-t-i-s-h history and carnage all over the world . 
  talking about dishing out without being able to take any . 
  instead of standing up and confronting your own blood-smeared past all you can do is quickly change the subject to `` hitler , hitler , hitler , gas chambers , two world wars and one world cup , doo-daaa '' . 
  but hey , that 's ok , i do understand your frustration to a certain degree . 
  britian is on the brink of insignificance , while germany confronted its own history , rose from the rubble and is today widely considered to be europes powerhouse . 
  i guess living in the past glories of the old empire is pretty much all you have left to be `` proud '' of today . 
  so please feel free to continue , but for the love of god , try harder . 
  may i suggest to mention our ugly , unshaved women and how the krauts occupy your sunbeds with towels . 
  maybe a little personal insult here and there . 
  sucks to be you , i guess . 
  try harder . 
  just realized you already played the godwin card with the first answer . 
  god , did you even try ? 
  all the valuable time . 
  lost . 
  disappeared into thin air . 
  can not be brought back . 
  just like the british empire . 
  godwin joker played . 
  game over . 
  you lost . 
  again . 
  if you feel the urgent need to bow to someone you should bow to the us for saving your asses and fighting your war . 
  again . 
  so , yeah . 
  fuck you very much . 
  that 's what you get for letting others fight your wars , instead of stepping up for yourselves . 
  fun fact : germans fought on ** both ** sides . 
  for * money * on the british side , and out of * conviction * on the american side . 
  can you guess which side fought more passionately ? 
  [ friedrich wilhelm von steuben ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_wilhelm_von_steuben ) gave the british a pretty good ass whooping and you deserved it . 
  funny , as far as i remember , you guys also did n't look too good when trying to control those few insurgents over in america . 
  and the indians . 
  * indians * they ca n't even drink . 
  * jutes : germanic * angels : germanic * saxons : germanic plot twist : i am your father !, 
  come join the dark side . 
  we have cookies . 
  fair enough . 
  italians are such trend-setters . 
  hipster germans : anglo-saxons invaded england before it was cool . 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  yeah , you 're partially right . 
  so you are saying the success of a military action is measured by pure body count rather than precision , effectiveness and velocity ? 
  i will have to tell you that you are very wrong . 
  not even the military thinks that way . 
  why not just drop the bomb next time and make a glas crater out of the middle east ? 
  boom - stunning military success . 
   i challenge you to find a better example of power projection . 
  ever . 
  invasion of poland by nazi germany : 4 weeks . 
  polish casualities : 904,000 invasion of the netherlands by nazi germany ( 5 months after ) : 4-7 days dutch casualities : 2,332 invasion of france by nazi germany ( 1 month after ) : 6 weeks . 
  french casualities : 2,260,000 you want me to continue ? 
  example of power projection : yes . 
  stunning success ? 
  ask the victims . 
  they relate to the claim of ( the invasion ) being a stunning military success . 
  according to wiki-leaks / classified iraq war logs : ** 109,032 deaths including 66,081 civilian deaths . 
  ** more than 50 percent of all people killed were civilians . 
  are you fucking high ? 
  should n't they be working ? 
  i do n't think there is a good answer for that . 
  it 's like asking what fashion is like in germany . 
  it really depends on the particular person . 
  i personally like [ michael mittermeier ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofmaswvis_e&amp;feature=relmfu ) or [ b\u00fclent ceylan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dpraczmmdc ), 
  it was a compliment !, 
  germany , uk and maybe also finland : brothers in bars !, 
  you sure as hell had my vote !, 
  it hurts . 
  make it go away . 
  a german would never take orders from a fucking austri ... oh , wait !, 
  dude , joking is serious business here in germany . 
  the f\u00fchrer never walks . 
  he conquers . 
  i 'd prefer to stay here and just tell people i 'm a little mentally retarded . 
  the `` sense of humour '' question made the corners of my mouth twitch . 
  wtf is wrong with me ? 
  * unable to pay bills on time * skip meals  around 5.3 per cent of the population live in deprivation , ** defined by european statisticians as being too poor to pay the rent on time , to eat meat at least every second day or to buy a car , washing machine or colour television . 
  ** did you even read the article ? 
  fair enough , just hope we 'll still be invited to the bunga-bunga parties . 
  i do n't even know how to write ~ ~ egonomigs ~ ~ , ~ ~ ekkonomix ~ ~ , ~ ~ echomaniacs ~ ~ ... that word . 
  and i did n't downvote him . 
  so brave !, 
  and do n't forget to build a huge brick wall around england , too . 
  hell , put a roof on top while you 're at it . 
  i 'm sorry i ca n't hear your swishy whining over all the economy around me !, 
  til : i 'm part of a blue banana . 
  writes bullshit and gets downvoted : better call them nazis . 
  pathetic . 
  hipster terrorist, 
  not even the same league , buddy . 
  getting your puny asses saved by the us is not exactly what i would call a bitch slapping . 
  why ? 
  romney can clearly fuck off . 
  germany is obama-land . 
  yes we can !, 
  < txampion  : ** italy , pay your ... ** * well , fuck *, 
  no , the greatest threat is that aliens could land on earth and show us how to build a perfect society where no money is needed at all . 
  hey , independent , need a visiting writer ? 
  hit me up !,
