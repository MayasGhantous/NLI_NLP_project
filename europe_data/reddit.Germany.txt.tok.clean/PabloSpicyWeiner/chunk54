  that 's ok . we 've got our own base on the dark side of the moon . 
  we can wave as much flags as we want . 
  sadly you ca n't see them from earth :o(, 
  * tevatron must be stopped , no matter the cost * ~ europimus prime, 
  ** no , you chill out !!!, 
  ** ^ it 's ^ just ^ a ^ movie ^ quote . 
  4th of july still haunting you ? 
  ** do n't make us angry . 
  you wo n't like us when we 're angry . 
  well , shit . 
  time to change my flag . 
  iceland sounds nice !, 
  it would be interesting to see a percentage breakdown by country , though . 
  which would be doubtful , too , but can not be disproved so easily ;o), 
  are we discussing the influence they had with what they did , or whether they `` did anything '' ? 
  that was just one example to show that you were wrong . 
  they did something . 
  well , in germany [ they did ] ( http://www.piraten-dresden.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/420109_10150535017433226_582148225_9297194_1298168904_n.jpg ), 
  spoken like a true european, 
  as much as i hate the gema , this seems to be a first world problem . 
  why do n't you just use amazon to check them out ? 
  or if you really want to listen to them on youtube ... there are certain browser plugins ... 
  i read this is in alec guinness voice, 
  so ... can i have my warp drive now ? 
  crsp ... living in his union jack painted dreamworld . 
  i do n't get it . 
  dude , as i mentioned in multiple other threads : i 'm german , what do i know about humour ? 
  [ are you stalking me , or are you just still buttraped ? 
  ] ( http://de.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/v1h56/merkel_enjoys_german_football_victory_from_afar/c50giwk ), 
  one of my general rules for life . 
  i never said that we do n't have idiots in germany . 
  they just normally do n't get to write in bigger newspapers . 
  certain british newspapers however seem to be attracted by these people . 
  maybe it 's because they expect to get more attention when their bullshit was written by a moronic german instead of a moronic brit . 
  but please continue with this circlejerk . 
  woah , buddy , take it easy . 
  you are making too much sense . 
  noone wants to hear that . 
  co.uk : stopped reading here . 
   where are all gone all the austerity enthusiast of / r/europe ? 
  they are all gone are for to working so [ economy boost ] ( https://iftheworldwaspink.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/wtf-did-i-just-read1.jpg ) . 
   we must remain silent and only open our mouths when we have nice things to say . 
  so then what exactly were you complaining about ? 
   the world 's most important newspaper wait , what ?? 
  `` bild '' is is not even considered a newspaper in germany . 
  it mainly consists of fear , tits and the weather forecast ( quote : `` die \u00c4rzte '' ) , and is the german version of the british `` sun '' . 
  anyone taking this gutter press as serious newspaper was successfully trolled by the `` bild '', 
  i 'm german , what do i know about humour ? 
  so my quote obviously does not apply to you then . 
  let me quote myself here :  anyone arguing by using phrases like `` good little germans '' [ ... ] sounds like a complete moron to me, 
   blame cameron for what ? 
  for not having any relevant influence in this matter and being degraded to a spectator . 
  this is the price you had to pay for opting-out . 
  and obviously it is hard for you to swallow . 
  brits have the right to critizise whatever they want . 
  in fact they do it passionately . 
  their problem is , that nobody gives a shit when the guy in the backseat tries to give directions , and brits ca n't handle that . 
  blame cameron , not us . 
  you are right , that did not come out right , i 'll edit my post . 
  however his way of arguing still sounds moronic to me . 
  anyone arguing by using phrases like '' * good little germans * '' or '' * the other nations must form a united front against germany to prevent the destruction of europe , as they have repeatedly in the past * '' which doubtless is a reference to ww2 , sounds like a complete moron to me . 
  this anatole guy sounds like a complete moron . 
  well , you are doing pretty good so far . 
  * soon ... * ;o), 
  yeah , mostly that one and `` god save the queen '' . 
  the germans usually respond to that by disassembling the english football team in the match on a regular basis . 
    and whenever they play germany at football of course the england supporters always sing the ten german bombers song  the what ? 
  [ thank me later ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1m730cykic ), 
  four famous words : that is no moon . 
  think about it ... 
  nice try , william . 
  til, 
  germany does not have a secret base on the dark side of the moon . 
  granted , i might have been a little too optimistic by assuming this is general knowledge , but come one , dude , it 's even part of the porsche [ logo ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/archive/5/55/20100111235120!porsche_logo.png ) . 
  nope , never got asked about hitler or ww2 at all , which made me somewhat suspicious . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  come on . 
  do n't be so canadian . 
  * au-stri-a is the bubble shaped country in the middle of the european continent . 
  aus-tra-lia is that big island in the middle of the pacific which does not ... oh , forget it . 
  sure , the coala racing is every tuesday night in vienna . 
  come naked . 
  you made that one up , right ? 
  right ? 
  i was once asked by an american where i was from . 
  because i did n't want to bring him into an awkward situation i decided to answer just with `` i 'm from the same city where mercedes and porsche are from . '', 
  he nodded and answered : `` ahh , detroit '' true story . 
  as i mentioned in the other discussion : running away from all this mess to enjoy the show from outside , would be too british . 
  sorry mate , can not comply . 
  greece : * `` hey germany , give monies , ok ? 
  '' * germany : * `` well , if you 're willing to use it wisely , and reform your spending habits , we will help you get out of this mess as best as we can '' * greece : * `` wat ?? 
  we 'll get some backing '' * germany : * `` whatevs '' * uk ( backseat ) : * `` gnihihihihihi , also ww2 '' * greece & southern states back-up : * `` hey , germany !, 
  we has backup , now you give monies , plox !, 
  '' * germany : okay.jpg flawless logic . 
  what are we shooting at ? 
  ... to boldly go , where no pole has gone before, 
  i call this maneuver `` the reverse godwin '' ;o), 
  we once got it for free !, 
  sneaky , sneaky government . 
  real men of genius .
