  ariel sharon was as member of the israeli government ( and in fact military ) , and he did float the quoted strategy . 
  read about operation samson . 
  it 's not funny . 
  i was just pointing out that this sentence  but even if you give equipment away for free it obviously does n't still belong to you . 
  is not universally applicable . 
  that 's all . 
  i was n't quoting the poet , but this sentence :  which is the ** strategy floated by ariel sharon and others ** of using israel 's nuclear weapons which is not part of the poet , but obviously a well known fact . 
   [ ... ] samson option which is the strategy floated by ariel sharon and others of using israel 's nuclear weapons , possibly damaging the entire world , if israel faces annihilation . 
  do n't know why this gets downvoted . 
  it 's important . 
  wrong . 
  at least in germany there is a difference whether you are the ** owner ** or the ** holder ** of something . 
  unless the ownership is transferred to the holder , you are technically still the owner although you do n't have the submarines anymore . 
  but this is getting off topic now . 
  afaik , they got them for free . 
  so technically they are still ours . 
  we have a winner !, 
  i see , fine . 
  then megaball ^ tm . 
  and if that 's a violation of japanese copyright : ** gigaball ^ tm **, 
   if my neighbour makes good business , he will probably buy from my business . 
  but that principle also applies to a global economy : if new zealand makes good business , they will probably buy from europe . 
   like germany and austria have wat ? 
  now , that should n't be a big problem : everything stays the same , we would just rename the european championship to something more `` national '' like let 's say `` the superball ^ tm '', 
  chill , honey . 
  if there was a referendum , germany would certainly opt-out because of `` why the hell would we do something stupid like that ? '', 
  i can only imagine the outrage if germany really decided to leave . 
  i do n't see how this affects europe . 
  c'mon it 's only 5 % less than vice versa . 
  also we like ourselves less than the french like us . 
  aaaand you are still on the second place after the czech rep. 
  from my perspective it looks like europe expects us ( germany ) to act in a leading role in this crisis . 
  we did not ask for this . 
  but everytime germany tries do do so , everyone starts whining how we are all nazis and want to take over europe again , and bullshit like this . 
  frankly , i 've really had enough of that . 
  do n't like our advices ? 
  fine , then go ahead and play your game , but do n't expect us to gladly give you money by calling us nazis . 
  you are the ones that need us . 
  we are trying to help you , not to invade you , for christs sake . 
  the way greece acted in this matter was , at least for me personally , surprisingly moronic and it changed my attitude towards this country a lot . 
  i can only speak for myself , but the following quote describes my feelings best : * `` so many people forget that the first country the nazis invaded was their own . '' *, 
  i second this . 
  amen . 
  reading all this bullshit repeatedly using the word `` we '' as in `` all germans '' , makes me want to punch him in the face so badly ... 
  oh ... but the other thread said , that greeks actually do n't hate germans . 
  nevermind . 
  fuck you , too . 
  well if you compare life in a `` russian '' germany ( aka ddr ) to life in western germany ( aka brd ) , i 'd rather be an american vassal than a russian . 
  that 's for sure . 
  but poland can not into space :o(, 
  yeah , that tie makes him look like a total asshole . 
  oh , and maybe the fact that he killed 77 people . 
   we do n't like american football either . 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  certainly not me , because i enjoy watching it . 
  it 's the sissy version of rugby . 
   eurovision was presented as basically a gay pride festival this is actually a surprisingly accurate picture of the esc, 
  except for israel that is . 
  they get them for free on a regular basis . 
  haters gon na hate . 
  i 'm sorry i ca n't hear you over the sound of how rich i am . 
  fun fact : the nickname for the swiss in germany is `` canyonshitters '' ( schluchtenscheisser ) , and it generally means `` they shit in canyons '' . 
  also applicable to the austrians , by the way . 
   ... superpower ... most recent ... 1814 to the 1890s . 
  well , shit . 
   ... most recent world superpowers ... british ... you 're joking , right ? 
  tell me you are joking . 
  as a past ww2 german , i feel your pain . 
   some idiot starts screaming that ~ ~ brussels ~ ~ berlin is trying to take over the world ftfy, 
   no ground troops ? 
  no civilian resistance or runaway prisoners ? 
  really ? 
  you know this do you ? 
  yeah , obviously we germans know shit about germany and ww2 and how people in this country were treated and all that . 
  let 's have some british douchebag teach us a history lesson . 
  geez , shut the hell up already , because you clearly have no , niente , nada idea what the hell you are talking about . 
  * herp , derp , all i have to know about germany i learned from the sun , herp , derp . 
  you are an idiot . 
  fact . 
  just accept it , and crawl back to the hole you came from . 
  maybe the downvotes are coming from your fellow countrymen ? 
  i for one gave you an upvote , because i totally agree with you , and i am not from the uk . 
  it looks like we will never reach consensus on this . 
  maybe we should both just agree to be glad not to be french and continue bashing them . 
  well , then why all this [ outrage ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/paul-vallely-our-extradition-treaty-is-plainly-unjust-7606072.html ) and [ fury ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mother-hits-out-as-government-sends-british-student-richard-odwyer-to-us-for-trial-7565452.html ) ? 
  ok , now let me get this straight , so even someone with your limited intellectual capabilities can follow : * i was pointing out that indirectapproach2es critizism of the german extradition policies and his exaggerated amazement should be seen in relation to the british extradition policies where just recently the uk extradited a student to the us without a trial . 
  it 's uk news , you should read them * even indirectapproach2 admitted , that this was a fair point * a wild crsp appears , brings up some weird statements about the german secret services relation to the right wing underground ** completely unrelated to the discussion ** * when asked why this is brought up , and how this would contribute to the discussion , not so wild crsp suddenly starts crying about me not being able to take anything * i refuse to even comment on this crap * not wild at all anymore crsp starts randomly attacking others for downvoting his bullshit and makes some more ww2 references and finally reveals himself as being the little douchebag he is * the end, 
  now , who 's the one not being able to take any ? 
  and your point is ? 
  i mean , besides attacking germany by bringing up a topic that has nothing to do with this discussion . 
  oooooh i see : right wing !!, 
  germany , nazi , hitler and stuff . 
  * wink , wink * now i get it . 
  so why do n't you leave ? 
  have a nice day !, 
  we got decent autobahns ? 
  oh , the irony ... 
   yes , i am just being facetious . 
  kind of . 
  you misspelled butthurt .
