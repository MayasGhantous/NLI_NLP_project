  why ? 
  because if i want to use my computer i just want things to work . 
  i have no time to edit config files , install missing libraries , google error messages and shit like that every.single.time . 
  i 'm installing new soft - or hardware . 
  the icing on the cake was when i updated my last ubuntu installation through the regular update process , and the system was n't able to reboot anymore after that . 
  linux is for people who like to understand what is happening and why , but i would never recommend it for people who would just like to use their computer and want things to simply work . 
  maybe one day it will be , but after 10 years i 'm still waiting for a linux for the average user ( excluding android here ) . 
  oh scotland , never change . 
  i ultimately lost my shit when he started singing at around 0:50, 
  can you do a quick eli5 why this is n't already a thing ? 
  i tried to read the wikipedia article , but i did n't understand much of it . 
  yeah , i suck at chemistry . 
  so they are forcing us to look for alternatives and thus reducing our dependency on russian gas in the long term . 
  * that 's a bold move , putin . 
  let 's see if it pays off . 
  apparently somebody is standing on the line and blocking it . 
  totally not russias fault . 
  * -- virgil *, 
  [ namibia is still brewing beer according to the reinheitsgebot ( german purity law ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/namibia_breweries_limited ) and are pretty successful with it . 
  other than that we do n't have any special relationships to former colonies . 
  it 's because of the kangaroos and koalas . 
  everybody loves koalas . 
  the netherlands . 
  it 's basically a little germany with friendlier people , slower autobahns and weed . 
   ~ ~ injected ~ ~ snorted, 
  well * technically * you can . 
  it 's just that nobody will believe you and you 're proving that your word is n't worth that much . 
  so no mentioning of germany selling europe to russia anymore ? 
  how disappointing . 
  please come back and tell me more how we are secretly russia loving cowards , that are literally hanging on russia 's gas pipeline while raping the south . 
  well actually , do n't . 
  you are starting to bore me with your drivel . 
  you can go and tell your hairdresser about your conspiracy theories about the evil empire that is germany . 
  you are a joke . 
   and i ca n't express how glad i feel ** that america has moved to spike that long-term strategy in the above paragraph ** by pressing the issue on ukraine & the baltics , ** making the german government & elites choose ** that 's what you said . 
  you clearly overestimate the us influence . 
  not that i 'm too shocked about that . 
  the us will not make germany choose anything . 
  the german government will not let the us dictate our foreign policies . 
  you are currently learning the hard way that we are n't one of your vassals . 
  germany will act in the interest of europe and not the us . 
  and while i disagree with some of my governments actions , i fully support this . 
  as for selling europe to russia , [ here is where germany is currently positioned in terms of willing to risk a conflict with russia ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20140903/swedes-most-willing-in-europe-to-support-ukraine ) . 
  should shut you up quite nicely . 
  you were the one bringing up racism to begin with . 
  i said you are suffering from germanophobia . 
  and you keep confirming that with every single post . 
  if you can not distinguish between that and being a racist , you should look up the definition . 
  at least man up and admit you are shitting your pants seeing that germany 's economy is doing pretty well , while your own country 's economy is slowly heading south . 
  that 's also a reason why you have to boost it with your little wars here and there . 
  oh , and oil of course . 
  i bet if the ukraine had more oil , there would already be some of your fancy carriers on the way to crimea ready to spread some freedom . 
  other than that , i already said everything i have to say to you . 
  i 'm not going to discuss fictive scenarios , you are pulling out of your hat . 
  and i told you that already . 
  so stop wasting my time with your pointless whining . 
  oh boy , here we go again . 
  this is the first time i can actually agree with you . 
  in any case they would lose ukraine as partner and at the same time have an enemy military alliance right at their border . 
  i kind of understand why they are pissed right now . 
  their response to that just does n't fly well with me . 
  in my opinion the prospect of nato expansion into ukraine was enough for moscow . 
  i do n't think that anyone including putin is ready to start ww3 over that , because that would be the last world war on this planet . 
  even putin knows that . 
  what is happening right now is that russia is flexing it 's muscles to show the world where they are drawing the line . 
  they know they will not win a ground war , but who needs that when you have nukes ? 
  they are demonstrating their will to defend their border from an enemy military alliance . 
  mind you this is how i think they look at the situation . 
  it 's not my opinion . 
  i agree that the west can not let them rape ukraine , but i believe military intervention should only be considered if the last option to use diplomacy fails . 
  so no , i do n't think the situation is comparable to ww2 . 
  yet . 
  [ i have bad news for you , mr. wannabe swede ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2pt5lla.jpg ), 
  true . 
  does n't change the fact , though . 
  you should change your name to / u/lemurica420 . 
  you are really making the swedes look bad . 
   seems like we 're doing it a bit better than you . 
  you are exporting it . 
  one or two skyscrapers here and there is the price you have to pay for that . 
  deal with it . 
  i seriously started scrolling through his history after your comment . 
  then i realized that was n't very smart . 
   because of us garrisoning the fulda gap . 
  wow , you must be old . 
  desktop warrior . 
   nato 's borders being so far away from germany is one of the reasons germans do n't really seem to give a fuck about the baltics & eastern europe . 
  now you just went full retard . 
  you 've just proven you know jackshit about germany . 
  the last time i saw signs of the last war was today . 
  how about yourself ? 
  how are they not relevant ? 
  what error margin ? 
  while i 'm really up for raising germany 's military spending and fullfilling the nato 2 % , i 'm afraid that most of my fellow countrymen disagree . 
  and since the government is elected by the majority ... you know the drill . 
  what does it matter if it was only 70 years ago or yesterday ? 
  we still see the results in europe everyday . 
  i 'll just quote myself :  europe including my own country was in ruins not so long ago . 
  we have the right to be much more reserved when it comes to a threat of war . 
  maybe if you had the same experience already you would also think a little differently .
