  this does n't mean we are n't ready to defend ourselves . 
  we are just making sure this is the very last option we have . 
  believe it or not , the us could learn a little from europe when it comes to avoiding a war . 
  you know nothing of war ** on your own soil ** . 
  you never had a major city bombed to the ground . 
  not even in ww1 or 2 . 
  if your fun trips to other countries in the name of freedom are causing so much problems already , i can only imagine what people in the us would think of war if it was brought into new york , chicago or la. 
  ** your own government did that to your vets . 
  not europe , not russia , not iraq , not afghanistan or vietnam . 
  this is the freedom you are fighting for . 
  ** europe including my own country was in ruins not so long ago . 
  we have the right to be much more reserved when it comes to a threat of war . 
  maybe if you had the same experience already you would also think a little differently . 
  this does n't mean we are n't ready to defend ourselves . 
  we are just making sure this is the very last option we have . 
  these are the * direct * contributions to natos military budget . 
  your link shows general military spending by countries , and thus is n't related to your question . 
  you really are n't the brightest bulb in the box . 
  to be fair , that was at a time when europe was just waking up . 
  good to see it was put right by now . 
  no , you are wrong . 
  let 's do the math , because / u/jedibeeftrix obviously did it , too : 16.6 + 12.4 + 12 + 7.8 + 5 + 4.2 + 3.3 + 2.6 + 2.3 + 1.8 + 1.7 + 1.6 + 5.8 = ** 77.1 % ** total nato military budget = ** 147.1 % ** ** conclusion : the missing 70 % are contributed by the greatest country in the world . 
  thanks obama . 
  is / r/murica leaking ? 
  not much to tell you about . 
  as i said , there were n't any . 
  you did read what i wrote , yes ? 
  did you also understand it ? 
  let me repeat that for you : q : * what can germany withhold from nato if nato ignores germany ? 
  * a : * a miserly 16.6 percent of it 's military budget . 
  * are you downvoting because you are unable to follow the discussion , or just because you disagree ? 
   i think putin is trying to invade the east side of blatter so he can move closer to merkel , to pass some gas . 
  i do n't even ... you are a genius . 
  not much really . 
  except for [ a miserly 16.6 percent of it 's military budget . 
  ] ( http://natosource.tumblr.com/post/6525063731/gates-criticizes-nato-how-much-does-u-s-pay )  after the u.s. , the largest contributors to nato 's military budget are germany ( 16.6 percent ) ; france ( 12.4 percent ) ; united kingdom ( 12 percent ) ; italy ( 7.8 percent ) ; canada ( 5 percent ) ; spain ( 4.2 percent ) ; netherlands ( 3.3 percent ) ; belgium ( 2.6 percent ) ; poland ( 2.3 percent ) ; turkey ( 1.8 percent ) ; denmark ( 1.7 percent ) ; and norway ( 1.6 percent ) . 
  fifteen countries make up the remaining 5.8 percent . 
  you mean they are trying to push natos borders closer to russia ( and away from them ) ** for their own benefit ?? 
  ** sneaky ... 
  you are correct . 
  [ here 's a picture from the after show party ] ( https://now.mmedia.me/pages/imagestreamer/param/mediaid__1922967a-703e-484b-b8ca-e4ccef58c518/w__616/h__394/000_arp3557360.jpg ) . 
  here 's [ another one ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/09/article-0-1b3600d9000005dc-652_634x471.jpg ) . 
  they even had a [ special guest ] ( http://images.sodahead.com/polls/000151594/polls_obamaansosama_5600_377454_poll_xlarge.jpeg ), 
  this . 
  they never had their own country bombed to shreds or even a serious threat at their own borders . 
  worst they had until now was dead soldiers far , faaaaar away in islam land . 
  ok , maybe that one time the brits burned down the white house ... 
   once again , seriously doubt your motivations & commitment to the cause . 
  do you also doubt my commitment and motivations for rooting for bayern m\u00fcnchen ? 
  i hope not . 
  because * that * would really hurt my feelings . 
   i just seriously doubt your motivations oh , noes . 
  theapplemansam doubts my motivations . 
  sorry to knock you out of the skies , but i could n't care less what some random dude on the interwebs thinks about me . 
   i want to hear you pay mind to the sovereignty of german states as eu member-states and the dissolution of the federal german government first . 
  i will give you my opinion as soon as this scenario becomes reality . 
  it wo n't . 
  until then i can give you my opinion about the moons sovereignty if you want . 
  this is the second or third time you bring up bavaria . 
  did i miss the upcoming referendum about their independence ? 
  why would you even bring that up ? 
  and why bavaria ? 
  do you even see how you managed to turn this discussion about ** scotlands independence ** into a anti-german rant ? 
  this is a shitty way to discuss because it tells a lot more about your mindset than anything else . 
  i 'm still undecided if you 're just being butthurt about people actually being in favor of scotlands independence or if it 's just plain germanophobia . 
  holy shit , you got me . 
  that 's exactly what i * really * have in mind . 
  crippling the uk . 
  i really do n't care about the scots being able to take their future into their own hands without london patronizing them . 
  it 's all about crippling the uk . 
  because i 'm literally hitler , right ? 
  your butthurt is showing . 
  how ? 
  they wo n't even be in the eu anymore . 
  if if they would join on their own , it would still be brussels not berlin . 
  rooting for bayern in a football match also does n't concern me . 
  i will still voice my opinion . 
  and i could n't care less if you like it or not . 
  and we will be having a warp drive by then . 
   has the largest reserves of soft power in the world wrong . 
  what are you going to to ? 
  i will voice my opinion as much as i like . 
  so why all the outcry then ? 
  just chill and wait for the outcome . 
  i will be rooting for the independence supporters . 
  spain !, 
  you 're next . 
  yeah , your fellow countrymen already mentioned the immigration part . 
  while skipping the `` forcefully brought to britain as slaves '' part . 
  but that 's getting a little off topic now , is n't it ? 
  i take that as a sign that one side seems to think they have something to lose . 
  that 's not my criterion to support scottish independence . 
  my criterion would be the fact that my own people will be able to make decisions for my country and not being ruled by london anymore . 
  i suppose those are all english newspapers . 
  would be interesting to see a scottish newspaper with a similar headline . 
  does that even exist ? 
  should also answer your other question , 
  these headlines are oozing with fear . 
  makes me even more confident that independence is going to be the right choice for the scots . 
  if you 're referring to castles it was probably yours anyway .
