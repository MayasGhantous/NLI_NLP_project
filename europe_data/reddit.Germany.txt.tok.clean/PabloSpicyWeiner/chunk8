  i do n't care * i love it *, 
  because there never was a referendum on the eu . 
  are you a land surveyor ? 
  you are usually measuring a country by it 's population first . 
  unless you are a land surveyor , of course . 
  and how is that worse ? 
  * finland : 0,062 km \u00b2 / citizen * scotland : 0,015 km \u00b2 / citizen * germany : 0,004 km \u00b2 / citizen * england : 0.002 km \u00b2 / citizen if you 're trying to be a smartass , at least do the math . 
  no need to kick someone who 's already on the floor . 
  population finland : 5,414 millions population scotland : 5,295 millions, 
  it will at least get rid of london making decisions for them . 
  this alone should be enough to vote for independence . 
  let 's see you are the one calling me retarded , because i 'm supporting scottish independence . 
  i guess the same applies to the majority of scots then , too . 
  are you even able to sit because your butt seems to be in major pain ... 
  alright , i guess we will have to postpone this discussion for 10 days then . 
  until then i 'll make sure to say  keeping my fingers crossed for you , scottish independence supporters . 
  happy now ? 
  my parents were n't born on a tiny island with access to a rather limited gene pool . 
  so no . 
  how about yourself ? 
  the latest polls suggest they do want independence . 
  and i can relate to them . 
  it will primarily strengthen scotlands position in the world . 
  do n't you have some sp\u00e4tzle to fress ? 
  splitter !, 
  keeping my fingers crossed for you , scotland . 
  edit : who the hell downvotes comments like this ? 
  someone must be mad about people being in favor of scottish independence . 
  fucking brilliant . 
  [ hopefully these guys feel a little stupid now ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fpyef/us_france_italy_poland_and_norway_to_send_ukraine/ckbm1kq ), 
  ** [ because it is also without everyone else . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/07/ukraine-crisis-nato-arms-idusl5n0r80t420140907 ) ** four of these countries already denied poroshenko statement . 
   a senior u.s. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , denied that the united states had made such a pledge . 
  the official told reuters , `` no u.s. offer of lethal assistance has been made to ukraine . '', 
   asked about lytsenko 's comments , defence ministry officials in italy , poland and norway also denied plans to provide arms . 
   `` this news is incorrect . 
  italy , along with other eu and nato countries , is preparing a package of non-lethal military aid such as bullet-proof vests and helmets for ukraine , '' an italian defence ministry official told reuters . 
   norwegian defence ministry spokesman lars gjemble , speaking to the ntb news agency , said , `` we 're participating with staff officers in two military exercises in ukraine , but it 's not correct that we 're delivering weapons to ukraine . '', 
   a polish defence ministry spokesman , lieutenant colonel jacek sonta , said by email , `` there ( was ) no agreement concerning supply of modern arms from poland to ukraine at the nato summit . '', 
  if you 're trying to start another of those anti-germany circlejerks , at least get your facts straight . 
  reading these comments here just makes me sick . 
  it looks like some people are just waiting for `` news '' like this to creep from under their rocks to stir up shit . 
  are those ships already paid for ? 
  i 'm guessing no ? 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xfvwpszxne ), 
  i see . 
  thanks . 
  but that 's not exactly what i would call a `` special '' relationship . 
  it 's a relationship . 
  nothing special about that . 
  we have the same relationship with other countries , too . 
  what is this `` special relation '' people are talking about ? 
  could you elaborate on that ? 
  i 've seen this being mentioned here and there but honestly have no idea what people are referring to . 
  / rekt, 
  implying we care about austria . 
  did anybody say weapons of mass destruction ? 
  [ if you will make a bavaria edition of this video i 'll consider it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khmvkroeowc )  y' all til bavaria = literally texas . 
  ergo baw\u00fc = california . 
  suck it , lederhosen cowboy . 
  but that 's merkels way of dealing with situations . 
  and she is quite known for that . 
  she makes sure to get ** all ** facts before making decisions , especially when these decisions might have serious consequences . 
  and that 's one thing i really admire about her . 
  people confuse this with being passive and indifferent . 
  this is not true . 
  at all . 
  i have no problem if people are criticizing her , god knows i do n't agree with everything she does , but that shit that happened in the last few weeks here in / r/europe was n't even funny anymore . 
  people even said the us was right to tap merkels phone , since it 's germoney , and we can not be trusted . 
  i eventually stopped disturbing the anti-german circlejerks with facts . 
  no gain in arguing with stupid . 
   remember how putin lied directly to merkel 's face multiple times this year ? 
  that looked quite pathetic to most of us ... at least she * tried * . 
  this did n't work out . 
  time to change the tune now . 
  and that 's what is happening right now . 
  if putin wants germany to man up , this is what he will get . 
  as a badener , i agree . 
  and rightfully so . 
  germany : not really . 
  we have several jokes about east frisians , but not about a specific city . 
  there is a running gag that [ bielefeld does not actually exist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bielefeld_conspiracy ) , though . 
  well , this is awkward . 
  i was just imitating / u/ftobias way of generalizing . 
  i know that shit did n't go down well in the us . 
  germany on third place after sweden and poland ? 
  this ca n't be true . 
  the / r/europe hivemind said we 're putin-loving cowards , and only interested in germanys well-being . 
  everybody else can go to hell , right guys ? 
  ** nato ** should jump into action if a ** nato member ** is under attack . 
  you 're asking the right questions . 
  slow down , buddy . 
  / u/pwnzerfaust was specifically taking about using  ** bullets dipped in pig lard against isis ** to which you answered  whilst offending millions of muslims ? 
  and after / u/srazors96 asked you if you would  pass over a chance to piss of isis ? 
  you then replied  and ** desecrating a mosque ** is an offense to all muslims , not just isis ? 
  congratulations on putting things in peoples mouth , they never said . 
  this is a shitty way to discuss , mate . 
  in my mind the term `` scottish independence '' is mel gibson with a blue face screaming `` freeeeeeeedom '' . 
  as an european , specifically from germany , i 'm surprised that you guys think it 's a good idea to give a nine year old girl an armed automatic weapon , but banned kinder eggs , because they might harm children . 
  same ( not uk ) .
