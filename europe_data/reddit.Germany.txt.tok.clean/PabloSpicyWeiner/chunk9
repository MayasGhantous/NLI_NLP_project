  your comparison may be comprehensible for a five year old , but it 's so oversimplified that it 's not even relatable to the current situation anymore . 
  from what i know , they are predominantly pro-eu . 
  this could be one reason the voices supporting independence are getting louder since london is n't . 
  problem is they have few to zero credibility . 
  me 2 , mate . 
  that 's because you do n't have a missile defense shield between minneapolis and chicago . 
  we do . 
  you 're right . 
  i should have read the article before my rant . 
  gauck was actually talking about a partnership not friendship . 
  ops headline just sucks . 
  i 'm sure at some point in time every nation had plans to invade other nations that were never actually put into action .

  or shooting old motorolas at poland ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  ~ ~ * sigh * if the nsa scandal should have taught us one thing , it 's that there is no such thing as `` friendship '' between nations . 
  what we have are partnerships because of common global interests . 
  that 's it . ~ ~ gauck was talking about partnership , not friendship . 
  ops headline is wrongly translated .

  cameron invoking the spirit of ' 38 . 
  who would have thought . 
  afd is a classic protest party that feeds on protest votes . 
  they are far from being controversial , if you spend a little time and look at their manifesto . 
  last time it was the pirates , this time it 's the afd . 
  i personally prefer `` die partei '' . 
  at least they are funny . 
  i still do n't get what / u/jedibeeftrix was trying to say with the `` a nation with a split personality '' part . 
  and your point was ? 
  was hoping they would send the [ ksk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ophonfu.jpg ) , too . 
  is cameron still a thing in the uk ? 
  last time i heard about him in the international news was when he was trying to oppose junker . 
  michael who ? 
  that 's just an abbreviation for sick bucket . 
  it 's not up to merkel to make that decision . 
  thanks . 
  i feel exactly the same . 
  i even stopped disturbing the anti-german circlejerks with actual facts , because that would just result in downvotes . 
  wasted time and energy . 
  if people are criticizing germanys actions * now * , i can only imagine the shitstorm , if germany really decided to send the bundeswehr into ukraine . 
  that would probably even go as far as making germany the new threat to europe ( omg , they are back !!!, 
  ! 11 ) , most likely with the uk as chief justice . 
  with friends like that , who needs enemies ? 
  wow , sounds harsh . 
  just glad merkel has nothing else to do and so much free time so she can take care of that . 
  i 'm sure getting called a bitch in return is thanks and stimulation enough to continue . 
  hey , at least we will sterilize our swords beforehand . 
  nobody likes infections . 
  * step aside people , the experts are here *, 
  since you obviously did n't even bother to actually read the article , here are the relevant quotes :  speaking to the media after a berlin meeting with balkan leaders , she said the ukraine crisis `` will be on the agenda of the council , and we will just have to ask ` how will we react ? ' '', 
   `` i want to say again ... we want a diplomatic solution , and we will not let up on this , but we have to acknowledge that things have become more difficult and worsened again in recent days . '', 
   merkel later spoke with us president barack obama about the situation on the phone , the government announced in a press release . 
   the pair agreed that such behaviour could n't go unchallenged by the west . 
  if that 's doing nothing '' * at all * '' for you , then kindly go fuck yourself . 
  she is currently putting more pressure on russia than any other leader . 
  where is cameron , where is hollande ? 
  she should n't even have to talk to obama about this , but rather to european partners . 
  and you dare calling her a bitch for doing * nothing * ? 
  really ? 
  there are clearly too many `` l `` s in this song for a russian . 
   it would have been a hell of a lot easier just to have given up west berlin/west germany and to consolidate what we had but we took a risk on including germany . 
  it was just a question of where to draw the border between the west and russia . 
  either you had a border in berlin fully under control with your tanks on german territory or in alsace with your tanks on french territory . 
  pulling west germany under protectorate was just a logical and strategic decision . 
  the german people only played a minor-role if any in these considerations . 
  and this is no accusation . 
  everybody would act this way . 
  i just do n't like that this is constantly sold as goodwill , just because your interests did align with the peoples interests . 
   it would have been so easy for the us , uk and france to sacrifice west germany in the interests of stability . 
   all it would have taken was a few compromises here and a lack of resolve/support there and the entirety of germany would still be cleaning up the wreckage of its time in the soviet block and that was totally out of good-heartedness , right ? 
  i mean it 's not like the actual reason was to not have russian tanks in the heart of europe . 
  roaming free and completely out of control . 
  let 's face it , that was just a strategic decision , so stop selling it as an act of kindness . 
  if germany would have been on the territory of say , belarus , nobody would have hesitated one second to give that territory to russia . 
  also stop generalizing . 
  `` germans '' are currently serving in the ukrainian army . 
  or are you saying they are also * `` so strongly for sacrificing ukraine '' * ? 
  try harder .

  what we should do ? 
  send the bundeswehr to the eastern european borders immediately . 
  break with the shadows of the past . 
  show presence and strength . 
  that 's the only language russia seems to understand . 
  what 's the point of maintaining such a costly apparatus it if we do n't use it ? 
  luckily the voices that support military actions seem to be getting louder here . 
  we can not just watch and hope everything will be ok . 
  same applies to is in iraq . 
  this is not `` their '' problem . 
  a mindset like this will make is `` our '' problem pretty fast . 
  they clearly said their goal is to have a worldwide caliphate . 
  if we do n't start to fight them there , we will have to fight them here .
