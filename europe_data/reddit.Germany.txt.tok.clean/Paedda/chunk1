only on certain occasions . 
  like the g7 summit this year , they controlled the borders into germany . 
  sure enough , they did n't pick up any terrorists , but loads and loads of illegal human trafficing . 
  it was so pronounced and so much that immediately many people called for permanent reestablishment of border controls . 
  what ? 
  was n't it founded by peter the great in the great northern war , by russia * against * sweden ? 
  that 's what i remember . 
  wow . 
  germany falls back to 65 million . 
  they are all moving to the uk , apparently . 
  the baltics , poland , bulgaria , greece , portugal also lose many people . 
  luxemburg more than doubles its inhabitants . 
  is that even possible ? 
  great population growth for scandinavia , too . 
  no wonder , really , but the difference is quite big . 
  well , grey mps do n't belong to a parliamentary group . 
  most of them ( 10 ) are extreme nationalists ( hungarian jobbik , greek golden dawn and such ) , but some ( 4 ) are not : 2 greek extreme-leftist ( kke ) 1 northern irish dup ( which as a conservative party could join ecr , but their competitors uup are already in there ) 1 of die partei , a german satirical party, 
  not just from a relativistic point of view ( if by that you mean the theory of relativity ) . 
  it is just a matter of perspective . 
  the copernican model is not about * sun around earth * vs. * earth around sun * , which is basically the same , but about the movement of the ** the other planets ** . 
  venus is the most earth-like planet . 
  i do not wish them dead ... apparently , english does not distinguish between starving = dying and starving = being hungry . 
  obviously they should just stop when they realize they accomplish nothing . 
  yeah , cherrypicking is not how society works . 
  also , everybody who uses the word gutmenschen should be presumed to be a schlechtmensch that is just envious . 
  yeah , kind of vague , of course ... you could argue that the first paragraph ( letting eu member states decide themselves about their migrant policy ) is not what is happening right now . 
  but the quote does include a confirmation of taking in refugees , if they can not return to their country of origin ** or can not be integrated in the country that first took them in ** . 
  syrians coming to greece and turkey . 
  in the last paragraph , they 're refusing economic migration . 
  i do n't think merkel 's policy is very different from that . 
  there are differences , yes , but you have to remember that she leads a * coalition * with the social democrats . 
  but who reads policy documents , anyway . 
  tldr : it actually is very close to what people voted for , even if they did n't know it . 
  the parliament has too little power , however , compared to the council . 
  but the national ministers are democratically determined , too . 
  it is mostly perception , i think , but there is some truth in it . 
  fair enough . 
  but i know that if the same would happen in germany , few people would bat an eyelid . 
  as defined by her or her party , obviously . 
  the notion that a politician should not lead his actions by a moral code , is something very new and ( and i think most people would agree ) much too nihilistic . 
  you are essentially arguing that there * are * no universal morals , and you can just define them however you personally want . 
  while i must accept that different people do have different morals , i still think there are objective morals , and all those personal codes are just approximations . 
  whether it is morally right to accept all those refugees is another discussion , but at least for merkel , it is . 
  it is obvious for me that she acts based on her moral convictions , not based on what she thinks would be ( economically ? 
  culturally ? 
  how would you measure that ? 
  how do you define `` best '' ? ), 
  best for her country or even for her party or her personally . 
  that plays a ( big ) role too , but is not the overall reason . 
  i think . 
  and i think that basic principle of what is right and wrong is exactly why a party should be elected . 
  all parties lay those principles out in their `` basic policies '' ( * grundsatzprogramm * ) . 
  they always get overshadowed by day-to-day politics , but if you know them , you can estimate how the party will react to an ( for the average voter ) unforeseen crisis such as this and vote accordingly . 
  interesting ... 
  i did not know that . 
  yeah ... exactly the wrong signal . 
  but that 's the way it is nowadays in the state churches , especially of sweden : there are too few actual christians left , and too many bishops and pastors that actually hate most of the not so modern and we-just-want-to-cuddle parts of christianity . 
  muslims wo n't feel welcome , they will feel disgusted . 
   articles 1-19 are under an eternity clause . 
  no , only article 1 and 20 are under such a clause . 
  til , on reddit , moral considerations = emotional baggage . 
  same kind of numbers . 
  there wo n't be 10 million each year . 
  the one way it might be possible are economic migrants from sub-saharan africa . 
  but these will not be allowed to stay , because they are not refugees . 
  this is total bullshit . 
  all she does is voice her opinion , that coincides with that of the majority of germans ( that rebuke the v4 for their extreme anti-refugee stance ) , and just because it is different than yours , she is a dictator ? 
  it 's her f *** ing job as german government leader . 
  has she threatened to send the military if czechia refuses to take refugees ? 
  she even refused the proposal to cut eu funds to these countries . 
  so calm down and tone down your rhetoric . 
  do n't make ridiculous claims . 
  there wo n't be 10 million . 
  where would they all come from ? 
  syria has only , what , 15 million people left . 
  even if it 's again 1.5 m next year ( and this number is highly dubious for this year ) , germany probably could support that . 
  not easily , but it could . 
  but it probably wo n't come to that , there will be some compromise that reduces the numbers . 
  like we 've recently seen with turkey . 
    `` a rejection [ of taking refugees in ] as a matter of principle , that is -- excuse me for being that blunt -- that 's a danger for europe , '' merkel said . 
   why ? 
  because then you will not accept * any * unified european approach to the matter , because they will necessarily include you taking * some * refugees yourself . 
  you can argue abeut the numbers , but not wanting to take * any * refugees as a matter of principle forbids a european compromise . 
  so , in a matter where it 's obvious that a european solution is needed , it is blocked . 
  things like that spell death for the eu . 
  of course that 's what some people want , but it will come with a cost . 
  what about improvising ? 
  you know , like germany does at the moment . 
  put them in tent camps ( yeah , maybe not in winter ... ) , gyms , empty publicly owned buildings ... also , you do n't have to keep them all somewhere central , just distribute them around the countryside . 
  each commune has to take 6 on average . 
  does n't that seem manageable ? 
  just asking , i know next to nothing about the situation in estonia . 
  yeah , the population always wants less immigration , i get it . 
  it 's the same everywhere . 
  but they never care about the bigger picture , moral obligation , european solidarity ... 
  there 's a reason not everything is decided by public polling . 
  at least , there has to be a compromise between `` nope , we 're not taking anyone '' and `` let them all come '' . 
  0.1 % of the population seems reasonable to me . 
  of course , economically challenged countries should take less , so it wo n't be 1300 for estonia , hopefully . 
  500000 is 0.1 % of eu population .
