you were asking about the sentiment among germans , not the political construct , were n't you ? 
  they 're not allies , they 're part of our ( european ) family . 
  some family members are poor , some are reckless , some are a pain in the ass and some are simply backwards , but it 's ** our ** disfunctional family . 
  if you start throwing rocks at our mentally handicapped grand-cousin or the adopted grand-nephew who always borrows but never pays back lunch money , you better have some back-up . 
  look at greece for example . 
  people were angry when it became apparent they lied to get into the euro and the measures taken to `` consolidate '' their finances were terrible . 
  still the general sentiment was mild resentment and a need for `` tough love '' . 
  kicking them out was discussed ( because every option deserves to be heard ) , but it never really was an option . 
  75 % may seem high , but employers and employees are usually able to make a deal both sides can live with , be it because they actually get along , because the strong worker-representation mandated by law or because strike is a very real threat that can cost companies a lot of money . 
  this means unions usually ( small niche unions are an exception here ) do n't call for strikes unless there 's reason to do so and then they often get 90 + % of votes for striking . 
  even if they `` just '' get 75 % of votes , this gives them a ** very ** strong mandate for the next round of negotiations . 
  if it helps you imagine us in bed , in german `` deutsch '' means missionary position . 
  mundane , easy to do , but gets the job done , i guess ? 
  albanisch ( albanian ) is shagging someones hollow of the knee . 
  do n't ask , i do n't know why , either . 
  that 's the thing , it 's not a few hundred euros . 
  germany alone pays about 16b $ anually for personell and another 6b $ for administratrion : http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bundeswehr-monitoring.de%2fauftrag-und-struktur%2fmilitaerausgaben-sollen-2013-deutlich-ansteigen-12952.html our government already acknowledge we 're in dire need of making our armed forces a more attractive career option , so expect these numbers to rise !, 
  looks ... good !, 
  though i 'd group austria with ce . 
  guaranteed compensation gets lower every year . 
  the total average includes facilities that were constructed in the past and actually do get up to 40 ct/kwh , while panels installed now get much less . 
  how is germany facing no energy unless we reactivate nuclear power ? 
  added renewable energy production already outpaces lost nuclear production and our oil and natural gas consumption ( of which we get about 1/3 from russia ) have been going down for some time now . 
  after fukushima merkel , in a moment of madness , ordered to put four old nuclear powerplants out of service instantly and guess what , we kept exporting energy . 
  all the while industrial energy prices are below the eu-28 ( !!! ), 
  average : 9.42 ct/kwh vs. 8.6 ct/kwh [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do;jsessionid=9ea7d07e30eefb4f453fefb5450ca44d82beb9a8f330.e34oan8pc3mmc40lc3amanytaxmme0?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=ten00114 ) the energiewende is not only about shifting how we produce energy , but also about reducing how much energy is consumed . 
  primary energy consumption has gone down about 5 % between 2000 and 2012 while our economy and prosperity kept growing . 
  umm , but we did replace the nuclear powerplants with renewable energy and then some . 
  nuclear share of power generation went down from 29.5 % in 2000 to 15.8 % in 2012 ( - 13.7 % ) . 
  renewables went up from 6.6 % in 2000 to 22.6 in 2012 ( + 16.0 % ) . 
  [ source \\ ( german \\ ) ] ( http://www.ag-energiebilanzen.de/index.php?article_id=29&amp;filename=20130809_brd_stromerzeugung1990_2012.pdf ), 
  absolutely . 
  nothing sticks , nothing stays . 
  people do n't care , really . 
  nuclear was never that popular in germany and people were mostly concerned with the uninsurability of nuclear power plants in case of catastrophy . 
  other than that people dislike one type of powerplant as much as any other and do n't care which type it is exactly . 
  germans like to be proud of our ecological achievements , but for most its more of a nice to have than something they really give a shit about . 
  i 'm to young to tell for sure , but i have a feeling people have n't really cared for anything but their immediate personal well being since at least chancellor kohl ( 1983 ) . 
  we 've had 3 chancellors in the past 30 years , 15 years of kohl and 8 years of `` sein m\u00e4dchen '' ( his girl ) merkel . 
  both made politics by disengaging the population from everything and waiting for problems to ( hopefully ) pass . 
  the remaining 7 years were with schr\u00f6der , who was elected for change but `` betrayed '' his electorate , which is partly true and was partly necessary due to the inactivity by his predecessor kohl , who let many valued institutions fall into tuin . 
  it 's still in use , just phasing out . 
  way faster than originally planned btw , because ms. merkel needed to do something after fukushima . 
  especially after she extended the phase-out time very bluntly ( blanket extension mostly unrelated to the power plants age , condition , usefulness etc. ), 
  just a short time before that . 
  like they did in crimea ? 
  so `` local self defense groups '' and no russian military , since they do n't have a military base there ? 
  i do n't see the problem with helping a nato member fight a civil war . 
  if russia gets officially involved it 's not about a county , it 's about wether nato is worth a damn or not . 
  i 'd expect fighter planes in the air within hours . 
  except russia ca n't just march in to help these militias if estonia decides to fight an insurgency . 
  maybe even with nato backing , who knows ? 
  they do ( i hope ) , but if the troika was serious about cutting expenses to actually help greece they should have asked for cuts in military spending , too . 
  i was n't thinking as much about being allowed to use some territory but about security . 
  neither pakistan nor eastern china are exactly calm regions and pakistan and india have n't ever been on friendly terms . 
  admittedly i do n't have any specific knowledge on the topic , but as soon as you 're connected to greece/bulgaria you 're connected to all of europe and can sell to germany , italy , france , etc. 
  just as russia does now . 
  seems like a pretty big market to tap into . 
  from iran to china or india you have to go through either pakistan or afghanistan . 
  from iran to greece/bulgaria you have to go through turkey . 
  is it really easier to get gas from iran to asia than to europe ? 
  right , i did n't think of that . 
  well , partly at least . 
  for gas it 's 2/3 we import : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/natural_gas_consumption_statistics still , much less frightening than the original picture . 
  looking at the numbers , not getting gas from russia seems much less frightening . 
  europe consumes about about 17 petajoule worth of natural gas annually . 
  we produce 6 pt , export 5 pt and import 16 pt . 
  16 * 1/3 = 5.3 pt come from russia ( [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:eu-27_imports_of_natural_gas_-_percentage_of_extra-eu_imports_by_country_of_origin,_2012.png&amp;filetimestamp=20130529121346 ) ) . 
  that 's about what we send away currently . 
  so if we stopped getting any gas from russia and stopped exporting anything , we 'd be short about 2 % of our usual consumption . 
  [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:provisional_natural_gas_balance_sheet_%28january-december_2012%29_in_thousand_terajoules_%28gcv%29-tb1.png&amp;filetimestamp=20130625095947 ) the eu has strategic gas reservces worth 90 days of full consumption , so if we do n't open up any new sources and do n't lower our consumption one bit , we 'd last more than 10 years . 
  speaking of gas consumption , that one has been going down for some time . 
  [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:gross_inland_consumption_in_eu-27_2012,_in_thousand_terajoules_%28gross_calorific_value%29.png&amp;filetimestamp=20130625095549 ) all statistics come from [ this ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/natural_gas_consumption_statistics ) article , so it 's actually just one source . 
  reader beware . 
  assuming it 's right , one should also take into account that the money we lose from exporting gas also would n't have to be spent to import gas either . 
  the largest problem would probably be the infrastructure to get the gas around , though i imagine we can use the pipes that currently come from eastern europe , to pump gas to eastern europe . 
  and now i 'm asking myself why we 're importing gas from russia in the first place . 
  according to statistics we barely need to ... 
  i do n't get it . 
  good question . 
  i 'm no expert on the matter , but i imagine we built these giant pipelines for a reason . 
  our pipelines mostly go to russia , so oil from other sources would have to be brought by ship . 
  i doubt there 's as much extra capacity as would be necessary to additionally ship in 1/3 of europes gas and oil supply . 
  you 're only thinking of electricity . 
  we need oil for transportation and unless battery technology advances really fast over the coming months , we wo n't be able to replace that with any kind of powerplant . 
  a lot of germans already want more say in the affairs of nations that need financial support . 
  wether this is warranted or not ; if the issue was adressed in the above manner , the populace would demand that governments give power to a german-lead european government . 
  not a good idea , not gon na happen . 
  that 's just depressing ... 
  not even a billion $ from germany ... no wonder we 're so far behind nasa and roscosmos . 
  i 'd really like our government to give some more money for this instead of lowering vat taxes for hotels or handing out money to stay-at-home parents . 
  ok , so the elites got what they wanted and greece may be able to start repaying some debt soon . 
  now what ? 
  greece needs a stimulus program , there 's no way around it . 
  who 's gon na pay for that ? 
  not ranting , just curious . 
  i hope you guys can get back to a normal life soon !, 
  all of them !, 
  seriously , there are very few castles that are awe-inspiring by themselves ( at least for me , but looking out the window i see two structures from the medieval times , so it may be different for you ) . 
  every one is different , they 're fitted amazingly to and into the landscape and the are in places which make you wonder how people got all that stuff up there 500 + years ago .
