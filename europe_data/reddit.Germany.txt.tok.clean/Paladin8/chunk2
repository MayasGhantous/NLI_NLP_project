  for me it 's not about castle x or castle y , it 's about the castle as a place of safety , power and a remainder of a very tangible yet far away culture in the same place i stand at right then . 
  if you absolutely need recommendations i 'd say go with mostly medium sized castles that are a tiny bit out of the way . 
  the rheintal has a lot of them , just look for those that do n't have a restaurant ** and ** museum and you 'll likely have a bit of space for yourselfs there . 
  also intermediate mountain ranges like odenwald , taunus , eifel , westerwald , schwarzwald , pf\u00e4lzerwald and hunsr\u00fcck are ripe with them . 
  i personally like [ burg breuburg ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/burg_breuberg ) , [ burg windeck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/windeck_castle_%28weinheim%29 ) , [ burg rodenstein ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/burg_rodenstein ) , [ schloss alsbach ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schloss_alsbach ) , [ burg k\u00f6nigstein ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/burg_k%c3%b6nigstein ) , [ saalburg ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kastell_saalburg ) ( roman fort ) and the town of neckarsteinach with [ four castles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neckarsteinach#four_castles ) . 
  among popular places i can recommend [ kaiserburg n\u00fcrnberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuremberg_castle ) ( impressive imperial castle ) , [ r\u00fcdesheim am rhein ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%bcdesheim_am_rhein#museums ) with it 's medieval museum and a castle ruin and of course [ schloss heidelberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schloss_heidelberg ) . 
  not all of the links are in english , sorry for that . 
  no , i am looking at it from the perspective of someone who is used to places having loads of things to see and cherish . 
  i could spend months just visiting the good touristy things in a 50 km radius from where i live . 
  in fact i have been visiting a castle every 3 to 6 weeks for 5 years now ( winter months excluded ) and have n't even been to all the ones i find really interesting . 
  it really puts things into perspective . 
  people i know who went across the atlantic did n't `` visit the states '' , they went to las vegas , new york , boston , los angeles , chicago or at best `` the northeast '' or `` californa '' ( i.e. 
  los angeles , san francisco and a two day trip to the desert ) for at least a week , usually longer . 
  there is no illusion that you can tour the us in any meaningful way in 14 days . 
  then again it seems prices are a bit less insane over here , as my father ( divorced , median wage earner , had to support me until 2007 , my brother until a year ago and a second wife and stepson until two years ago ) visited the carribean ( twice ) , new england ( once ) , north africa ( once ) , south east asia ( at least six times ) and several places in europe over the past 15 years alone without racking up debt . 
  because the first option allows you to experience one place while with the latter allows you to not experience many places ( yes , that sentence is worded as intended ) . 
  i call them us-americans . 
  edit : would those who downvote this please give me a hint why they do that ? 
  the figures in the article are likely eu figures , which use the same metric for every country . 
  the article says there 's 5.4 % unemployment in germany while german figures say 7.6 % . 
  about one bullet for every 1 million inhabitants for the entire year and more than half of them were warning shots . 
  sounds quite reasonable to me . 
  i think you 're missing something here ? 
   but i can ** ` t ** blame the germans that are not able or refuse to link those premises also the situation is even more complex : labor reforms were made by the social democrat-green government which ruled until 2005 and was followed by a big coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , which gave way to the coalition that 's currently in power . 
  most of the work was done by the last two coalitions and even in the big coalition social democrat secretaries did most of the hard work ( labor , defense , foreign politics ) , while christian democrats sat there ( for the most part ) and harvested the crops came election time . 
  unfortunately conservative voters tend to think `` things are relatively okay '' and keep voting for the same party , although it was other people who enacted laws that led to the current situation . 
  germany has a very old population and is aging ever more , so old people make up a sizeable junk of the voting populace . 
  you do n't really have to do any real governing to stay in power if you can appease this part of the population , which for the most part means keeping things the way they are and feeding whatever stereotypes and misconceptions these people have ( southern europeans are lazy , we rebuilt germany all by ourselfs and so can they , etc. ), 
  our success and southern europe 's problems are linked . 
  many people earn a lot less than 10 years ago , even if average wages increased ( the difference between top and bottom earners increased much more ) , which is why we can compete against the states in southern europe , which now have economic problems because of this . 
  also a lot of europe 's and germany 's problems could be much less severe if she did n't wait everything out until the last moment and acted instead of only reacting . 
  even your translations misrepresents the slogans intention . 
  `` it 's about ` us ' '' probably comes closer , with ` us ' being opposed to ` me ' , i.e. 
  working together instead of working only for oneself . 
  there was also a spd-gr\u00fcne minority government in northrhine-westfalia from 2010 to 2012 . 
  the nordic countries are northern , but not all northern countries are nordic . 
  can you back this claim up ? 
  even hybrid cars have enough reach for most day-to-day travel and methanization may soon provide an efficient way to transform , save and transport energy ( eldctrical and thermal on top if that ) . 
  all that beside recent and possible future advances in battery technology . 
  given that these windmills and hydroplants do n't fall apart between 2030 i do n't see how they 'd not contribute to these developments . 
  given how we 're bound to replace gasoline with electricity to fuel most of our transportation needs in the not-so-far-future this may not even be enough , actually . 
  our government has been offering shitty deals for quite some time and now it 's snowballed almost out of control . 
  elections in october likely wo n't bring any significant change and i doubt europe can sustain another 4 years like this . 
  it 's just horrible . 
  i 'm eurosceptic ( the currency as of now ) and eu-sceptic ( the political union as of now ) , but not europesceptic ( the continent and vision ) , does that help ? 
  google translate is a bit fuzzy , as always , but the gist gets across . 
  thanks for digging that up !, 
  first i thought you were arrogant or a troll . 
  then i realized you were playing a role . 
  bravo !, 
  do you have a source for this , by any chance ? 
  i 'd love to see that for myself and rub it in people 's faces . 
  thank you for writing the reply i was about to write . 
  europe 's military is splintered , not small . 
  if we pool our resource we could easily afford a carrier group or two and expeditionary forces large enough to intervene in situations like libya or syria on our own . 
  we 'd have to spend a larger share of our gdp to match the us , but that much is n't necessary for our goals . 
  sometimes people write stuff so mindblowingly stupid and shortsighted , i really want to write an ad hominem attack . 
  then again , why should i put any more effort into this than they did ? 
  just thinking loudly here , do n't mind me . 
  no , it 's not the same . 
  german laws would have made it impossible for the shooters to even get their hands on firearms . 
  the us shooters may have broken the law by actually grabbing the weapons they used , but the ease of access was perfectly legal . 
  if you do n't even have the opportunity to get guns in your hands , that 's a much higher barrier to overcome . 
  i 'd be with you if it did n't work so damn well . 
  now you 're shifting from one topic to the other yourself . 
  if you keep doing this , consider this my final reply . 
  the american war on drugs is a prohibition campaign , not a year long war with hour-long firefights between army units and drug cartels armed with assault rifles and machine-guns . 
  stop talking about what you do n't understand . 
  i thought you wanted to stick with mass shootings ? 
  those that were stated above did n't relate in any way to the war on drugs , in case you did n't notice that . 
  also there 's still the argument that there was n't a single comparable incident in the largest european country this year , while the usa had at least half a dozen . 
  believe it or not , but gangs , drug and human trafficking and so forth exist in europe as well . 
  there was a case of 7 people shot in 2007 , which caused widespread horror because it was basically unprecedented and remains unrepeated to this day . 
  even our crime syndicates do n't go around with guns blazing . 
  i highly doubt the overall effect of the mexican drug war would be anywhere near the level it is at , if it was significantly harder to get firearms . 
  our rockers beat each other up and have knife-fights over turf , drugs and prostitution , but that 's far less dangerous than being shot with a pistol , let alone a rifle or pump-gun . 
  regarding `` stand your ground '' and `` castle doctrine '' i 'll just refer to another post of mine : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14wlp6/reading_about_the_conneticut_massacre_as_a/c7h507x the original talking point was `` in civilized societies the monopoly of violence lies with the state '' . 
  the linked post illustrates why the idea of self-defense with weapons against crime is a bad one , and why the monopoly of violence should indeed lie with the state . 
  you 're entitled to your opinion , but that does n't make it any more valid . 
  only as long as there 's an imminent threat , your response is proportionate and there 's no state authority present to defend you . 
  i was once involved in a fistfight after some drunk was angry because i did n't share my cigarettes with them ( i do n't smoke ... ) and got charges pressed against me because i headbutted him after he grabbed me by the collar and refused to let me go , while his friend encircled me . 
  it was dropped due to insignificance ( and because they jumped me afterwards ) , but i broke the law and was interrogated by police . 
  so no , it 's banned . 
  that post was from / u/iceani , i am / u/paladin8 . 
  make sure you got the right person before accusing someone . 
   mexico stats in the link are from 2010 and 2011 -- no civil war . 
  what ?!? 
  [ the mexican drug war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican_drug_war ) has been going on for 6 years , there were 24,000 casualties in 2011 alone and not to long ago the mayor of one of the larger cities was abducted by a cartel , tortured and raped and her corpse thrown into a ditch . 
  what the fuck is this if not civil war ? 
  no , you just confuse power with violence . 
  power lies with the people , but violence is banned by law . 
  there 's no right to hurt your fellow man ( or woman ) , but the state retains the right to use force against this citizens under certain circumstances , i.e. 
  if they commit violent crimes themselves . 
  i 'm not shifting anywhere , i just did n't realize you meant mass shootings when it 's easier to compare overall intentional shootings . 
  but in that case it 's even easier : not a single mass shooting in 2012 in germany , at 1/4 the population . 
  northern mexico is in a state of civil war , gun laws do n't matter there one way or the other . 
  germany , 2006 , pop . 
  82m , 190 shot fatally . 
  usa , 2008 , pop . 
  305m , 12,000 shot fatally .
