  about 17 times as many casualties per capita . 
  i 'd say that 's significant . 
  disclaimer : i have n't found more recent statistics for germany , that 's why i 'm using old numbers . 
  that 's completely unrelated to why gun laws help prevent death or injury by guns . 
  outside organized crime , criminals usually do n't have access to guns . 
  the robber on the street and burglar usually are n't armed with anything more than knives or clubs . 
  even if they were armed , they could safely assume i am not , because law abiding citizens either do n't have weapons , and even if we do they have to be safely locked away and the key has to be stored in a different place which is n't easily accessible . 
  you are n't allowed to carry guns around on the street , regardless of if you legally own them . 
  so even if i defend myself , criminals do n't have a reason to shoot me . 
  so yeah , criminals do n't shoot me because of strict gun laws . 
  you 're welcome . 
  yes , if you 're neck deep into organized crime . 
  i 'd guess they feel threatened more easily and thus resort to self-defense and by this violence easier . 
  `` in the land of the free , everyone is on his/her own '' , or something like that . 
  i really do n't get why people do n't realize their argument works the other way around , too : a robber can now legally carry a concealed gun around and if he decides to mug someone , he has to assume his victim may be armed . 
  so from his perspective it 's safer to just shoot and then rob the victim . 
  same goes for burglars , who have to shoot anybody they find awake in the house they 're breaking in , or they risk them getting their guns out and shooting back . 
  just as homeowners should shoot any perp they find or risk them unloading their magazines into the homeowner . 
  being armed to defend yourself is nice when you can prepare yourself ( e.g. 
  19th century warfare ) , but crimes do n't give you time to prepare . 
  if someone was to break into my house and i were to confront them ( which is pretty stupid anyway ) they 'd either threaten me or run off , but my life would be in little danger . 
  the excessive number of deaths by guns is not only caused by gun culture but also opportunity . 
  the one after which the boy 's father got convicted for violating gun storage laws ? 
  the only other gun attack on schools in germany ** ever ** was the one in erfurt 2002 with 17 dead , which was only possible because someone fucked up the paperwork . 
  from a legal point of view the culprit was n't allowed to own any of his weapons . 
  so yeah , if the gun laws were being followed neither of these attacks would have happened . 
  then you 're having a conversation , not a discussion . 
  not saying one or the other 's better , but these are different things . 
  discussions are more heated by their very nature . 
  discussions are n't always about finding a common ground . 
  there 's two fundamentally different types of discussions : those in which you try to convince the person you 're discussing with and those in which you 're trying to convince readers that your point of view is `` better '' than the other one . 
  a socialist and a laissez-fair capitalist wo n't convince each other of their respective worldviews , but they may provide observers with information why one choice may be better than the other . 
  how does this relate to my comment ? 
  is there a native polish minority in hamburg ? 
  have they applied for minority protection ? 
  if not , polish is not an applicable language in official business , like when children are taken into custody by the jugendamt . 
  also doctomoe 's comment seems to be very relevant . 
  if they kept their culture and language i 'd be surprised if they would n't be granted minority rights if they asked . 
  interesting , i did n't know that . 
  thank you !, 
  yes , like turks in germany . 
  obviously this wo n't work word for word , because people die of accidents or illnesses way before they lived a full lifetime . 
  something along the lines of the average life expectancy should work , though . 
  it 's also a matter of belonging . 
  there 's a difference between people who live in a place to work and those who shape their surroundings and get shaped by then . 
  personally i 'd say a minority is native once the first of them has lived his/her whole life in a foreign region and yet retained the heritage . 
  minority rights are valued highly across the world . 
  a certain degree of protection for minorities guarantees that the majority ca n't force the minority to adapt their ways , unless these go against the law . 
  it 's an exception from the rule , that 's correct , but not every exception is bad . 
  if danes or sorbs applied for similar rights , they 'd be granted under the german constitution , as well . 
  there 's a native polish minority in germany ? 
  the only thing that comes to my mind are the ruhrpolen , but i think they do n't view themselves as poles anymore . 
  edit : really ? 
  downvotes ? 
  instead of just answering my question ? 
  i do n't know if there is a polish minority in germany , but i 'm confident they 'd get similar rights if they have a legit claim . 
  just as the danes and sorbs got , even though they did n't apply to all possible minority rights . 
  only 82 % picked texas correct , 43 % for new york and 38 % for alaska ? 
  usually both . 
  to be fair , there is civil war raging in these countries . 
  france is n't attacking a stable nation just for the lulz . 
  you do n't get that france wants to lead europe and thus has to take action when no one else does ? 
  i guess bnd and mad did n't throw away stasi 's contacts to nations formerly aligned to the ussr . 
  that 's a once in a lifetime find , after all . 
  ooooh , interesting !, 
  it seems like their joint operations are n't ready to deploy yet , but having europe 's two major military powers team up seems like a great idea . 
  now if germany would join in , even if only in a defensive/support role ... a man can dream , right ? 
  france once was a global power and still is very influential . 
  the uk is more aligned with the usa than a possible use , while france would be a major player in a unified europe . 
  if this europe wants to keep it 's influence in worldwide politics , it 's got to show that we 're able to deal with crisis 's in our immediate neighborhood . 
  france has a lot to lose if europe is seen as a decaying power . 
  germany , italy and spain are either unwilling or unable to step in and a uk intervention would n't be associated with a european effort per se . 
  so who 's left ? 
  exactly , the grande nation . 
  i doubt it 's about something else than `` primary occupation '' . 
  a summer job does n't make you part of the workforce in statistical terms , you 're still a student . 
  i can only work 19 hours per week because i 'm enrolled in university . 
  if i worked 20 hours i would be considered part of the workforce , had to pay social security fees and generally lose my status as a student . 
  it 's more along the lines of application training and the like , i think . 
  this has changed a lot since 2000 . 
  i gave private lessons until half a year ago , mostly to kids in haupt - or realschule ( the two lower options ) , and most of them enrolled in secondary education right after they finished school , and got an advanced degree at the same time those who chose a `` higher '' path did . 
  personally i 'd prefer a more unified approach where kids stay together until at least age 14 . 
  but it 's not separated roads anymore , but crossroads that allow to change one 's path fairly easy . 
  usually all you have to do is not have abysmal grades and fill out some papers . 
  if the ultraorthodox nutjobs manage to put their parties in power fairly often by gathering a 50 + % coalition with parties that are ready to accept their position on settlements and security measures in the occupied territories and foreign politics , there are three apparent conclusions : - the nutjobs are numerous enough to be counted as `` ordinary israeli citizenzs '' . 
  - the average israeli citizen votes for parties that are similar enough to the extreme right to put them in power . 
  - enough average israeli citizens do n't care about what happens , so the nutjob minority makes up a significant part of the voting populace . 
  neither of these options shines a good light on the people , so fire away if i 'm missing something !, 
  on the other hand you did n't have to pay for your berufsschule and got a certificate from a renown institution that asserts to future employers that you 've got high-quality training . 
  vocational training usually takes 3 years and the first 2 are a loss for most employers . 
  yes , it 's less money than you could make by starting into full employment right away , but most people get out of their apprenticeship at 18 or 19 and earn decent money . 
  also the chart goes up until age 24 , which means those who got good training are also more likely to keep their employment . 
  ** tl ; dr ** it 's not just the wages . 
  the israeli government 's behaviour in general is a pretty good way to start antisemitism . 
  i know there 's a difference between despising the israel government and despising jews , but not everybody makes that distinction . 
  also i 'm not sure anymore if the israeli people do n't deserve being despised as well . 
  they have repeatedly voted for parties who tolerate or encourage an apartheid regime . 
  that 's pretty fucked up . 
  my gut tells me `` peace process '' means `` israel can continue doing whatever it wants in peace/without retaliation '' to some , so of course this may disrupt their `` peace process '' . 
  call me a pessimist , but i 've given up hope that the israeli ruling class really wants to live in peace with an independent palestine .
