  the palestine authorities only have control over so much of the occupied territory , while large parts of the west bank are more or less part of israel itself by now . 
  if independence was a serious option to israels government , they would n't permit thousands of settlers to move to the occupied territories just hours after the vote . 
  could be that some people do the work , while others sit at home and complain on the internet , too . 
  it 's no wonderland and most places have n't stopped pestering paid volunteers who rely on some public assistance , so this system simply is n't in place everywhere . 
  my home city ( 150k inhabitants ) took in 3,000 refugees over the past week and the red cross asked people to stop donating stuff , because they already got too much to process . 
  it can be done , if we enable the people to do it . 
  our governments are n't exactly known for doing that , sadly . 
  for what it 's worth , germany 's poor are pretty well off materially . 
  the unemployment agency treats them like shit , but unless they have loads of children the money and other support they get is sufficient . 
  i live off this support system due to a mental illness and many of my friends have lived off it for some time after they completed their training or lost their job . 
  those who do n't have `` proper '' work are encouraged to volunteer , which gave rise to a pretty well developed system of low-payed but well-treated and highly-regarded volunteer workers . 
  unemployed people giving out donated clothing , food or organizing events for poor people is n't an uncommon sight . 
  the ones who help out and organize help for refugees are often poor themselfs and thus know how it is to have little . 
  volunteer work actually gives them some money ( even if they only get food , they save on their diet ) and a break from the horrible treatment of the unemployment agencies . 
  germany is doing splendid regarding finances , and our interest payments are going down every year . 
  if refugees manage to get `` proper '' work or - assuming they ca n't - integrate into this system of semi-volunteer low-paid labour , we could actually get a lot of projects done with the additional workforce . 
  our infrastructure sure could use a helping hand . 
  automation does n't need autonomous entities . 
  it just replaces all or most menial labor with machines . 
  ** summary : ** someone set up an indiegogo campaign with a financing target of 1.6 bn $ , to cover the imf payment , that is due on july 1st , 6am cet ( in about 6 hours ) . 
  the campaign has since raised well above 100k $ in about a day ( last i saw it stood at 135k $ ) and has now apparently attracted too much attention for indiegogo 's servers to handle . 
  there are a lot of differing opinions to chose from among the parties not currently in the bundestag . 
  it 's 2 years until the next elections . 
  if you really believe something must change , get out now and build a platform !, 
   they still do not represent us anymore . 
  that is why so many people are upset and angry . 
  welcome to representative democracy . 
  next federal elections are in 2017 and you 're welcome to vote for someone else . 
  or , if you belong to the 30 % of citizens who could n't be arsed to vote at all , you 're welcome to vote for anyone at all . 
  there 's quite a few small parties who will gladly take your help during campaign season and your vote on ballot day . 
  you 'd have to use quite excessive force to get evicted from germany , especially if you have a good track record otherwise . 
  i did n't mean to imply anything , just to give you as full of a picture as possible with the limited information i had . 
  on a more general note , the less vulnerable you appear ( more/stronger/sober people ) , the less likely you are to fall victim to any of this . 
  violence in general is less prevalent here , so any case of assault is handled with high priority . 
  criminals know this and look for victims who 're not able to fight back , so they do n't need to use violence and thus attract less attention . 
  a can of pepperspray is enough to drive off all but the most determined attackers . 
  in theory german self defense laws are very restrictive , only allowing for the minimal force necessary to escape a dangerous situation to be applied . 
  in practice it 's a bit more lenient , especially if you 're in danger of being surrounded or something alike . 
  severely hurting one attacker to drive off a dozen will cause an investigation , but will likely not lead to a conviction , unless you used unnecessary brutality ( knife instead of blunt weapons for example ) . 
  the french also buy german renewable energy in the summer , when they have to throttle their nuclear plants due to cooling issues . 
  plus , those are consumer prices . 
  industry power prices are average , in comparison to other eu countries . 
  those are consumer prices , though . 
  industry prices are pretty much average , compared to other eu countries . 
  even so , i live alone and pay 33 $ per month . 
  if that fell to say 20 $ , it would n't make much of a difference . 
  nope , read the disclaimer . 
  youtube blocks videos because they ** may ** contain material which gema represents , so youtube blocks them preemptively . 
  youtube does n't actually check wether the material included is represented by gema . 
  we could , but it would kill you . 
  do you have any arguments or is denouncing people based on where they live your only point ? 
  good people will do good things regardless . 
  bad people will do bad things regardless . 
  for good people to do bad things , religion is a prime cause . 
  religions are by nature resistant to change . 
  we 've surpassed them , leaving them behind would only be logical . 
  i like to think of it more like [ this ] ( http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5124e369e4b03a5603d25473/5124e903e4b0936daddf83f1/5124e9cee4b0936daddf8c2e/1361374118342/ ) . 
  it reads :  against strong opposition of the church we have accomplished :  human rights  freedom of opinion  freedom of religion  freedom of the press  rule of law  women 's rights  abolishment of slavery  ban of torture  abolishment of the death penalty  freedom of the arts  ban of corporal punishment  animal rights the little man at the bottom yells : `` well , but we did invent charity ! '', 
  ( as in `` love thy neighbor '' ) . 
  basically we declawed christianity so much it is n't a threat anymore . 
  poland seems to be keen to reverse this . 
  more lika montana or idaho , actually . 
  it does n't matter which products are best . 
  the average quality of food is what concerns the populace at large . 
  does the 35 km tunnel system only have access on the ends ? 
  because that would be the situation of the proposed connection . 
  no ventilation , no access for maintenance/repairs , no way to get there but from one end or the other . 
  a 5 minute schedule with 30 minutes travel duration means 6 trains in the tunnel . 
  if the power goes out , worst case scenario you 're 11 hours ( 45 km ) on foot from the nearest exit . 
  can you continously bring in enough air to support a few thousand people for several hours ? 
  ( the trains could be air-sealed and vented at each station . 
  not so the tunnels ) if a train breaks down , you got to clear the tracks first , by bringing all trains to their stations , then get personell there . 
  in the event of a fire ... yeah , good luck with that . 
  suffocation will likely kill everyone before help even gets there . 
  the eurotunnel is 50 km long and runs on a 15 minute-interval max . 
  this one is almost double the length and wo n't run on a denser schedule . 
  assuming a 15 minute schedule , the calculations made above hold up and pose no serious threat to the economy . 
  yep , no difference at all between a metro subway system and a 90 km tunnel under the baltic sea . 
  i think you overestimate the carrying capacity of such a system . 
  lets assume one train per direction per 30 minutes from 5:00 to 23:00 . 
  at a capacity of about 500 passengers per train , that means a whopping 18,000 people can go from one side to the other each day . 
  make that one train per 15 minutes and 700 people per train and we 're talking about 50,000 people . 
  if - and only if - each and every train runs at full capacity . 
  since working hours are n't distributed evenly over the day , full capacity will not be utilized . 
  i really do n't see this being a large problem . 
  that 's simply wrong . 
  declaring someone persona non grata communicates the intention to expel someone . 
  part of customary international law - which diplomatic immunity is a part of - is to adhere to that decision or have the person lose protection from persecution . 
  they 're simply given a fair chance to leave the country . 
  they would still enjoy protection of the grounds of the embassy , but once they step off they 're fair game . 
  look up some foreign ministery 's guidelines , they 're pretty clear on that . 
  immunity is given by the host country and can be revoced by the host country . 
  declaring someone a persona non grata is basically a warning that there will be consequences if they do n't leave . 
  these events did n't happen within days . 
  you 're being willfully obtuse . 
  you 're proposing that events with 200 , 50 and 3 dead are on the same scale as the northern ireland conflict , eta conflict or the balkan wars ? 
  come on ... 
  not to devalue all you 're saying , but for people born after 1985 , europe was `` always '' a peaceful place , assuming one gains conciousness for these matters some time between the age 10 and 15 . 
  the conflicts your mentioned had all wound down by 2000 and for the past 15 years there simply was no mid-to-large-scale conflict in europe , up until euromaidan .
