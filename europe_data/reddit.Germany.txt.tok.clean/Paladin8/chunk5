  i noticed the war against serbia and knew that there had been conflicts in spain and northern ireland , but i took them for weird exceptions from the rule . 
   i come from a region that was ravaged for 30 + years with terrorism . 
  you can not extend solidarity , unity and friendship to people who live in separate and parallel communities , because you have no contact with them . 
  huh , i guess munich 's mosques did n't open their doors to stranded travelers , then . 
  even though most people usually have zero interaction with their local mosque . 
  he spoke accent-free german , though . 
  he may be an immigrant or the descendant of immigrants , but most likely not a refugee . 
  sweden has gotten away with not being a member of the erm for 14 years now , thus excluding itself from the euro . 
  if not de jure , that 's still a de facto opt-out and would be politically difficult to enforce by now . 
  sweden and denmark got opt-outs which the new members ca n't utilize . 
  the idea obviously is n't to overthrow the turkish government and dismantle the state institutions ( which is what caused the chaos in lybia and iraq ) , but to remind the turkish government that they do n't run the show and might get hurt if they step over international boundaries . 
  because the government with the second largest military in the nato , a few million refugees wanting to get to europe within their borders and in control of one of the most important geostrategic locations on the continent has turned lunatic . 
  maybe . 
  there 's an exception , though . 
  if a party manages to win three district seats , they get proportional representation , too . 
  it 's called the grundmandat-klausel and last came to effect in 1994 in favor of the pds , which only got 4.4 % of the vote , but won 4 district seats : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/grundmandat#bundestagswahl, 
  that 's the case almost everywhere . 
  gastarbeiter were unskilled labor brought in from underdeveloped anatolia . 
  more of a problem with suburbia . 
  with that kind of sprawling , public transportation simply does n't make sense . 
  too many stops for too few people , making the travel time unbearable . 
  i was n't contesting your point , just tried to provide some context as to why malm\u00f6 is in the focus so much . 
  as an aside , cologne is germany 's fourth largest city and was in the news quite a bit after nye 2016 . 
  but that was because what happened there was so much worse than what happened everywhere else , not because it was the most readily available example of the situation in the whole country . 
  most other places where perfectly fine . 
  i 'd guess it 's similar in sweden right now . 
  malmo is situated in the south of sweden , close to the most accessible border of sweden ( to denmark via bridge plus ferries from germany , denmark and poland ) . 
  thus , it 's the first big city newcomers reach , which makes it a natural place for immigrants/refugees to congregate . 
  my guess is they do n't . 
  they just have n't figured out how to deal with it because a ) their values are at odds with the apparent solutions . 
  b ) they have n't yet decided on which stances they 're willing to yield how much . 
  the idea that certain populations submit meekly to the misbehavior of immigrants is proposterous . 
  just because we outsiders do n't see the solution process , does n't mean it 's not already happening . 
  contrary to authoritarian regimes , these things take time in a republic . 
  take another look in a year or two and we 'll see what things changed . 
  ** a ** place with 90 % immigrants is not safe , not ** all ** places with 90 % immigrants . 
  it has often been the case in the recent past , but we also had a lot of vice chancellors that were n't foreign minister : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/vizekanzler_ ( deutschland ) #liste _ der_vizekanzler_seit_1949 8 ( 9 ) of 17 were foreign minister , but a few of those who were n't had very short tenures ( 14 and 23 days for the two shortest ) . 
  who would have thought that people who had a tough life might have an idea how to get through tough times , amirite ? 
  adenauer , too !, 
  and do n't tell me he does n't count since he 's dead , kohl has barely any mental faculties left ... 
  the bamf will decide that , but it will hear your case . 
  luckily it does n't say that . 
  read his blog . 
  he only sees and hears what he wants to see and hear . 
  his allegations are at best stretched , at worst divorced from any common sense and if i had to make a judgement call , i 'd guess he has a mild form of shizophrenic paranioa . 
  schulz has been in politics since the mid-80s , 23 years of experience in european politics , serving as president of the european parliament for some 5 years . 
  she has more experience as chancellor , but overall political experience ? 
  i doubt it . 
  there 's still the option of a ampelkoalition . 
  schulz is rather to the right of the spd , the greens have been tempered by ruling baw\u00fc . 
  there is a ampelkoalition in rheinland-pfalz and 3-party-coalitions have become ever more common . 
  schleswig-holstein , berlin and th\u00fcringen for example . 
  i too am surprised how little credit the spd gets for implementing basically their whole program in a coalition with a cdu that almost got a majority of seats in the bundestag . 
  how is it not cut and dry ? 
   art . 
  that 's one of the articles protected by the ewigkeitsklausel in art . 
  there 're no conditions , no cop-outs from this simple rule . 
  if you 're fleeing for legitimate reasons , you have a right to asylum , wether you 're no . 
  we can of course try to help these people at home or in some intermediate country , but if they apply for asylum , the constitution forbids us from denying the application and process . 
  an upper limit will be struck down by the courts in no time . 
  plus , most turks in europe are descendants of the people who emigrated in the 60s for work , most of which came from backwater anatolia , have little to no education and are more religious than the average turk . 
  they 're erdogan 's target audience , wether they live inside the borders or not . 
  for eastern european countries it might as well be . 
  for germany , france or even croatia , not as much . 
  those countries have no incentive to agree to such a measure . 
  we 'd have to pay them off . 
  `` rest will stay at the camps '' is exactly what did n't happen . 
  for all the faults turkey has , they did take in millions of refugees , same as lebanon . 
  then , after years of waiting , these people continued and the economic migrants followed , when they realized nobody was stopping the syrians and no one was going to stop them . 
   syria is one of the must culturally diverse countries in the middle east and has accepted all basic human rights before it went to shit because of us europeans . 
  not to shit on your point that general syrian culture was rather liberal , but syria was/is also a dictatorship where people disappeared , got tortured and killed for political dissent . 
  how dare i have a different opinion !, 
  on one hand , belgian beer can be pretty rad . 
  on the other hand , this is more true the further away one is from germany . 
  seems like an awefully long trip for `` merely '' good beer . 
  germany does n't go anywhere because our beer is damn great !, 
  except maybe czech republic , since they make some good stuff , too . 
  ... which is different from paying out the wages evenly how ... ? 
  i 'm not trying to be snarky , i just do n't see the difference . 
  what 's stopping you from putting aside some money the other 10 months of the year ? 
  the tax base to fund the referendum is also several magnitudes smaller , so in relative terms the cost are n't much different . 
  germany did n't want the euro , france basically blackmailed us to join in , holding reunification hostage . 
  plus , germany does n't have a majority of seats anywhere within the eu . 
  not in the commission ( where everybody gets one commissioner ) nor in parliament ( where german mps make up 13 % ) . 
  if anybody had given a fuck , things could have gone differently . 
  but why bother with the big bad eu , amirite ? 
   i you ca n't manage to decide on a single work language then i do n't think you can talk about integration . 
  so every other way in which europe has grown closer does n't mean a thing , unless there 's a common working language in brussels , luxemburg and strasbourg ? 
  sorry , i 'm not convinced . 
   also when your motto is `` united in diversity '' but you have to create a multi-speed europe because none of the countries manage to agree on anything you ca n't talk about integration either because they share fuck all . 
  so , you can only have diversity by having uniformity ? 
  is n't a `` europe of different speeds '' an embodiment of diversity itself ? 
  you 're mistaking the eu for a potential centralized state , when it 's a community of communities coming together to end centuries of strive and find a better future for all involved . 
  integration does n't mean that you have to give up who you are , but for us to find ways to work and live together , in our differentness . 
  for the people , a lot has changed for the better . 
  national politicians pointing to brussels whenever they fuck up or the world economy is taking a dive does n't change anything about that . 
  not everything works , but looking at 1790 to 1945 , i 'd say we 're doing an okay job . 
   we signed up to an tradeing organization . 
  and then you signed another treaty and another and another and the nature of the union changed . 
  this did n't happen under the radar , but was signed off by all members of the union .
