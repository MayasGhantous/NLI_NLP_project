  it 's not a trade partnership anymore and it should n't be handled like one . 
  if you want more say , step up . 
  the only reason germany is as dominant as it is , is that no one but us wanted anything to do with furthering the eu , thus there was no one else to take the rudder . 
  everyone else has only been talking about all the bad stuff the eu supposedly ( or unsupposedly ) caused , no wonder their governments completly missed the opportunity to shape what the eu does and looks like . 
  if cultural elimination is what you think european integration means , it 's no wonder you do n't understand what 's going on . 
  our constitution does n't have provisions for this , but the preamble lists which states make up germany and have given up some of their sovereignty to become part of the federal republic . 
  thus , their being part of germany is an essential component and jurisdiction of the federal government . 
  at least that is how i understand the legal situation and what i 've gotten from people , who far more proficient in the matter than i am . 
  on top of that , it 's wholly unclear what the legal status of a newly split-off region with regards to eu membership would be . 
  you totally missed the past 25 years of political and cultural integration , did n't you ? 
  why should arbitrarily drawn borders from 70 years ago define who gets how much of a vote ? 
  say bavaria splits from germany one day , what reason do we have to suddenly give them 6 times the voting power they had before ? 
   no one really knows why , but the pattern seems to hold in accounting books , as long as they are honest because of relative growth . 
  growing a business from 10,000 $ profit to 20,000 $ profit means 100 % growth . 
  going from 20,000 $ to 30,000 $ only means 50 % growth , so we should see a lot more business reporting something between 10,000 and 20,000 $ , than between 20,000 and 30,000 $ . 
  the same holds true if you add more digits . 
  this is why we see many more numbers starting with 1 than 2 or 3 , and so forth ... 
  the low interest rate , set by the ecb , has been a point of contempt for germany for a long time now . 
  most who wrote something negative about the pirate party did it in a tone i 'd not have a discussion in . 
  there ** is ** some pro-pirate bias on reddit , but asshats are asshats and are treated as such , no matter their position . 
  also i think here 's a thread of discussion that went rather well : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13rhd5/german_pirates_party_struggles_to_define_policy/c76nz9u, 
  it becomes even more ironical once i tell you that i thought about laying some of the problems down and decided not to for the same reason i did n't post on topic in the first place : i 'd had to tell people things they could easily learn by themselves , which implies that they either were n't interested in the first place or take the matter not as serious as i do . 
  i know this is n't correct 100 % of the time , so if this does n't apply to you please be aware that this is the impression you make . 
  take 5 minutes to read up on shit , then post !, 
  as i 'm on sick leave today , lets make a point and dissect some of the comments i meant : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13rhd5/german_pirates_party_struggles_to_define_policy/c76jo1t http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13rhd5/german_pirates_party_struggles_to_define_policy/c76w035 not a single word to explain the position the commenters take and the jump from `` the idea is insane '' to `` those supporting the idea are insane , too '' is n't that far . 
  i 'll be honest and out myself as a numbers nerd who crunched some of the numbers and found that a modest basic income of 400 $ is easily affordable if we scrap stuff like alg ii , kindergeld and altersgrundsicherung and levy another tax so everybody who earns something repays part of the basic income and everybody above a certain threshold ( i think i used 1600 $ ) would effectively receive nothing because they pay as much as they get in basic income . 
  secondary effects like lowered bureaucracy or multiplication of available funds were n't accounted for . 
  those who rely on basic income only would n't make ends meet with so little money , but wohngeld would be available to everyone then , so someone who lives off 400 $ basic income and pays 350 $ in rent would get another ~ 200 $ . 
  this is obviously too low , but the infrastructure and laws are already there and payout would have to be altered only moderately . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13rhd5/german_pirates_party_struggles_to_define_policy/c76jxda condescending and misleading . 
  there have been discussions in the party before , but apparently this poster would rather the party lies to him instead of saying `` we do n't know yet , but feel free to join the discussion . 
  it 's on our agenda and you 'll have something in hands before the next election '' . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13rhd5/german_pirates_party_struggles_to_define_policy/c76klgb if refuted this myself . 
  it 's a lie . 
  this level of disinformation or dishonesty does not only not encourage discussion , it drives people like me away . 
  the comment thread appended to the most downvoted top-level comment does n't need any further commentary , i think : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13rhd5/german_pirates_party_struggles_to_define_policy/c76irik edit : also i 'd really like to know why you where downvoted . 
  s/he voiced a valid concern , anyone feel like stepping up ? 
  hammyman 's second paragraph was n't exactly thought provoking either . 
  i doubt he wanted it to be neutral , so it got opinionated votes . 
  would n't have been so hard :  like virtually all niche parties , ask them what their policies are on the really important stuff that matters to people day to day and they either shrug their shoulders or come up with something * that sounds more like a dream than earnest politics * same content , no implicit insults . 
  they did n't sprout discussion , just arguments . 
  the tone was condescending or mean and the up - and downvote system reacts accordingly . 
  a level-headed comment that addressed the pirate party 's issues would have been treated otherwise , but i fear by now this thread is done for . 
  to be fair , most posts had a huge bullseye painted on them for being uninformed or misleading . 
  none of the comments offered any base for discussion . 
  the green party did n't have a full fledged program in 1981/82 . 
   in single cases , yes , but doing that to a whole group would be cultricide . 
  that 's why i inquired . 
  the apparent lack of schooling of sinti and roma children implied to me that there was basically no way to get them to complete an education ( given that they 've been here for some time now ) , so i was wondering if there was no middle ground between extinction and a parallel society . 
  thanks for elaborating !, 
  honest question : what type of integration do you think we can ask for in return for integrating sinti and roma into our welfare and security system ? 
  if the parents are harming their children by withdrawing them from basic education , should n't they be placed in foster care anyway ? 
  if there 's any sensible way of tackling these problems , please tell me !, 
  from what i 've seen and read there 's nothing we can do but pay them money and hope for the best , but that 's no way to run an advanced society . 
  i guess now it 's their turn to get out of their rabbit holes ? 
  you know very well i was adressing the issue of small countries being overruled by larger countries . 
  even in representative democracies it 's still the rule of the people and thus popular majorities should generally decide where we 're heading . 
  giving tenfold weight to some votes due to some historical division is n't exactly something worth going for . 
  wrong . 
   democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives . 
  i do n't find any comfort in going for the easily achievable . 
  i dislike my life far to much to not aim as high as possible while i put up with it . 
  you 're right in your analysis , though . 
  it would take a major revolution to achieve anything like that ( ruling out a large war ) , so i 'd rather be ready when the skyscrapers start burning , 
  it 's called democracy . 
  decisions should be made by the majority of people , not the majority of states . 
  if germany splits into 4 different states ( 21m people each , only 6 eu states have a higher population right now ) that would give us about 30 % more voting power . 
  that 's not to say the quotas ca n't be somewhat skewed to give small states any representation , but having malta veto the entire eu does n't seem fair either . 
  wow , i did n't even think about that . 
  guess i 'm to far removed from the holocaust-responsibility ( born in ' 88 , oh the irony ) . 
  also israel ( s right ) has done a great job at pissing off the whole world . 
  it 's a fucking apartheid regime by now . 
  piggy-backing your comment . 
  i would apply `` the mess '' to the whole decision making process and citizen-state-union relations as well . 
  the eu was clearly designed as a partnership between governments , but as it grows and claws deeper into everyday live , it ought to become a more democratic institution that 's directly approachable by the people . 
  a parliament with two chambers , the lower house voted for directly with almost proportional representation ( somewhat like the european parliament but more proportional ) and the upper house voted for indirectly with skewed representation ( not like the us senate , more like the german [ bundesrat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesrat_of_germany ) or a mixture of both ) , would do us much more justice . 
  obviously the lower house would deal with more day to day business and determine government , while the upper house keeps the balance between states and the union . 
  also the states need to undergo some change . 
  i do n't think that different sizes are a problem in and of themselves , but if we choose to live in an united europe we may as well let go of some petty squabbles and give autonomy to those who want it . 
  states with 400k inhabitants have very different interests than those with 83m and if the small states want any representation the quotas have to be horribly skewed . 
  instead set a upper and lower limit for population and/or economic power ( e.g. 
  10m to 30m ) and a timeframe ( 2030 ? ) . 
  then let the people sort out where they want to belong . 
  states and regions should separate , merge and exchange territories to make new borders that better fit today 's world and for territories large enough for sustained independence and small enough to actually adress the people 's needs . 
  also i think we need a ( at least ) two tiered system of membership . 
  the uk surely would n't want to join in all this , but that does n't mean they should have to leave the union . 
  instead have `` full members '' and `` associated members '' . 
  associated members do n't take part in certain institutions or treaties ( or need to opt-in ) , so their representatives do n't get to vote on these matters , much like the british parliament is also the english parliament , where mp 's do n't vote in matters of england alone . 
  these ideas sure are n't perfect , but if we 're going for use this is the general direction we 're heading into . 
  i think we need to rebuild the eu before admitting any more new members , save for those who are almost in already . 
  in the meantime the balkan would certainly be happy to get some help in building up governments and maybe redraw some borders to actually reflect the realities there . 
  the european union was founded on the idea of sustaining peace and equality . 
  israel performs really bad in both regards . 
  i had to think for a moment before i even remembered this country lies in europe . 
  a dictatorship so close seems surreal , but it made the choice easy . 
  i merely answered the question , there was no judgement intended from my end . 
  the sentiment about being underrepresented has grown over the last years for a number of reasons : the problem is n't that germans think the eu members should do exactly as germany did but that those whose politics were contrary ( e.g. 
  vast spending instead of getting your stuff in order when the economy was good ) now need and ** expect ** help from those who made these cuts voluntarily . 
  many people know austerity without stimulus wo n't help greece , but some first want satisfaction by seeing them suffer through the same measures we did before things become right again . 
  the damages this causes are accepted because that 's what happens when you get to the er instead of treating your problem while you 're still able to .
