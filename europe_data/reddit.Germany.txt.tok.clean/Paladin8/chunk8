  in germany , parties are financed by membership - and mandate-fees , public funds and donations , in this order . 
  public funds are allocated by number of votes recieved ( 1 $ for the first 4m votes , .83 $ therafter ) and by income from fees , donations and other sources of income ( .45 $ per $ gained this way ) . 
  donations make up about 15 % of party finances and must be publicized if above 10k $ . 
  third party organizations paying for political events , ads and the like is largely unheard of . 
  rarely , but yes . 
  these days mops usually leave their party and become independent members . 
  joining another party does n't happen often . 
  here 's a ( german ) source : https://www.bundestag.de/blob/196154/2a9265957425746f7126e01d938facb8/kapitel_05_04_fraktionswechsel-data.pdf, 
  it 's actually the result of a complicated process that spans back to 1961 . 
  konrad adenauer ( cdu , conservatives ) had been chancellor since the frg 's founding in 1949 and was in a struggle for power with his secretary of economics ludwig erhard , who was strongly associated with germany 's economic revovery after ww ii , the `` wirtschaftswunder '' , and thus hugely popular . 
  adenauer was already 73 when he entered office and in 1961 he was 85 , feeling the push to finally leave office . 
  the cdu had been in power ever since , sometimes alone ( 1953-1957 ) , but mostly in a coalition with the fdp ( libertarians ) . 
  adenauer finally agreed to pass the office to erhard in 1963 , who was a total disaster as chancellor and lost the elections in 1965 . 
  erhard formed a new coalition government with the fdp , which fell apart only one year later and lead to a `` grand coalition '' of cdu and spd ( social democrats ) under leadership of georg kiesinger ( cdu ) . 
  this grand coalition lasted from 1966 to 1969 , when spd and fdp agreed to try something new and form a government , even though the cdu held the plurality of votes . 
  new chancellor was willy brandt , who was secretary of state and vice-chancellor under the former government , who fled from germany during ww ii , was born out of wedlock and generally known as a charmer/borderline-womanizer . 
  the fdp had shifted quite a bit to the left during the grand coalition , but there were still elements within the party that leaned closer to conservatives . 
  gradually , fdp mpp 's left the fdp and joined the cdu , until the government finally lost it 's majority in parliament . 
  instead of voting itself into government , the cdu used it 's new majority to call for early elections in 1972 , confident that they would win . 
  the populace did n't agree and punished them for their `` silent coup-de-tat '' , by voting the spd strongest power for the first time since the frg 's inception . 
  if you have follow-up questions , feel free to ask !, 
  germany was ruled by a social-democrat/leftist-libertarian coalition from 1969 to 1983 . 
  out of the 4 elections ( 1969 , 1972 , 1976 , 1980 ) , the social-democrats only won the plurality of votes once ( 1972 ) , the other three times the conservatives came out ahead . 
  conservatives tried to put a spin on this during election campaign , but apart from that it was totally accepted that parties may form a coalition government , even if they did n't get the most votes . 
  there 's an american obsession with tattoos ? 
  i have n't noticed anything out of the order , but then again i 'm from a rich , liberal european city , so my perception may be off the average . 
  germany : you 're likely to run into long-haired men , more so in the cities than rural areas . 
  most people do n't care , though you 're more likely to be faced with prejudice if you behave out-of-order . 
  professionally it 's not a problem in white-collar jobs and rarely a problem for blue-collar jobs . 
  i have long hair and have worked as a software developer , project manager , lecturer , tutor , private teacher , it person and some odd jobs in grocery and hardware stores . 
  never had any problems , as long as you keep them clean and do n't mind using a hair tie if necessary . 
  on a more personal level , some people are less likely to approach you ( some older people and immigrants from more conservative areas ) , while people under 40 and especially children seem to associate long hair with open , helpful people . 
  it may be just me or i 'm misremembering things , but it feels like i 'm approached for directions or translations much more often than the people around me . 
  even if i 'm in groups i 'm approached more often than my peers . 
  as far as i 'm aware there 's no historical connotaion . 
  long hair is usually associated with hippies , metalheads or artsy-types , though i would n't call the 60s and 80s history , just yet , 
  that 's what i tried to address with my first paragraph . 
  on social issues democrats are miles ahead of most european states in places , while in other places democrats are quite conservative . 
  with a country so vast in both geography and population and only two political parties , it 's only natural that these parties cover quite some different positions . 
  regarding the bundesbank and our `` schwarze null '' wolfgang sch\u00e4uble i have no objections . 
  they 're needlessly driving europe towards a cliff for the sake of adhering to 60 years old economic preferences . 
  it 's not 100 % accurate , due to the us being so large . 
  while the culture is relatively homogenous ( compared to europe ) , there 's quite some difference on social issues . 
  for context , i 'm from germany . 
  generally speaking , the most leftist democrats match our moderate social-democrats , while the average democrat is more comparable to our center-right conservative parties . 
  what we call leftist does n't seem to exist in the us political spectrum . 
  some republicans would fit in with our center-right laissez-faire libertarians , but their national leadership is so batshit insane , they would be ridiculed for even speaking out their ideas . 
  the party program is a weird mixture of social and economic policies , that range from center-right to far-right/dark ages . 
  possible , but not feasible . 
  especially with the direction things have been developing in the recent past . 
  i find it far more likely that the eu restructures membership into a tiered system which turkey joins on one of the lower levels , than turkey becoming eligible for membership as we know it now . 
  what i hear from others seems unpleasant , but i personally do n't have a strong opinion either way . 
  i 've seen one of their trailer groups once and two got arrested for stealing on a flea market i was selling stuff at , but other than that i have n't had much contact with gypsies . 
  so i 'm rather indifferent . 
  it does get more annoying outside of the cities , though . 
  i once moved from a city ( 140k pop ) to a nearby large town ( 15k pop ) . 
  it was only 20 minutes to city 's public transport hub by bus , but getting around the town by bus was far less comfortable than getting around the city and of course getting to different parts of the city took some more time . 
  i really did n't need a car ( / bike/scooter ) , but if i had had one i 'd have gotten to work in 15 minutes instead of 40 ( 5 min to the bus stop , 20 min to the hub , another 10 mins to the stop next to work and another 5 to work ) . 
  would have been more expensive , but then again time ** is ** money . 
  now i 'm back in the city and love me my public transport < 3, 
  corporations should pay their share , but we realize it 's all to easy to migrate profits , so we 'll take as much as we can and as little as we must . 
  what people often forget when they talk about taxes is that this money does n't disappear but pays for something . 
  taxes in western europe may be higher than in the us , but they pay for many things people would have to pay for themselves instead . 
  as a consequence , incomes in europe are quite a bit lower than europe than in the us . 
  i 'm from germany , where a pre-tax annual income of 20k $ allows me a decent life , because i do n't have to pay out of the ass for insurance or save money for emergencies , because we stand in for each other via taxes . 
  at 40k $ i 'd be well off and at 60k $ i would be rich enough to not have much to worry about in life anymore . 
  six figure incomes are mostly unheard of , unless you need someone really good for a very narrow or sought-after task . 
  what companies pay more in taxes , they ( at least partly ) pay less in wages . 
  you pay for this stuff one way or another . 
  the difference is we think of our governments as merely self-absorbed and somewhat inefficient , not evil . 
  this way we still get good people to work there and thus get enough value out of our taxes to entrust our government with our well-being . 
  we may pay more in taxes , but we pay way less for other things . 
  i do n't ** want ** people to correct me , but if i make an error consistently or wrote something different from what i intended by making a mistake , i 'll appreciate any guidance given . 
  i 'm in the subway , listening to blind guardian , thanks for asking . 
  to me it seems like on average europeans are less interested in music that entertains or spreads a joyful mood than in music that has a meaning of itself and can be projected onto . 
  metal is n't exactly easy-going and concerns itself with the dark party or life pretty often . 
  on top of that the us has a large demographic that 's more interested in rythm-based music ( afro americans and hip-hop ) and mexico is rather religious and has a strong hispanic music scene . 
  not surprised montreal is americas metal capital , after all it 's cold and harsh up there and quebec is considered the most european part of the americas ... even if they 're a bunch of damn frog-eater descendants , 
  i 'll piggyback on this one , since you asked for corrections . 
  the german primary education system is overseen by the states , so the length of time you spend in school , what kind of diploma you get after a certain time , how school and vacation is structured varies from state to state . 
  the broad strokes are the same , though . 
   5 or 6 . . mostly 6 . 
  i was 5 and half as i went to school . 
  in my experience it 's more like 6 or 7 . 
  if you 're born in july or august you can postpone going to school for one year , so you 're not very young when entering elementary school . 
   well , if it 's until the hauptschulabschluss , realschulabchluss or gymnasium then about 10 years ( 10th grade ) . 
  you then can continue with abitur in a gymnasium or so . 
  two or three more years . 
  oh well , here it gets complicated . 
  all kids go to elementary school , which lasts 4 to 6 years . 
  some states split the 5th and/or 6th year from regular elementary school and call it `` orientierungsstufe '' ( orientation phase ) . 
  at some point kids are going to be split up into haupt - , realschule and gymnasium . 
  hauptschule goes until grade 9 and is aimed at manual labor , realschule until grade 10 and is aimed at skilled labour/trades and gymnasium until grade 12/13 and is aimed at academics . 
  there are also so called gesamtschulen where kids stay together until at least grade 10 and then either go on to take vocational training or continue to a gymnasium or oberstufengymnasium or fachoberschule or whatever to get their abitur or fachabitor ( university access diploma , respectively college access diploma . 
  there 's a difference over here ) . 
  but , after finishing haupt - or realschule you can also go to a myriad of other schooltypes to climb up the ladder , which differ from state to state . 
   free . 
  except that you have to buy the books needed for the lessons . 
  well , at least this is how it was for me . 
  yes , there are private schools as well .
