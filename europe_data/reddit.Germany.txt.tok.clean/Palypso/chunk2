  there are more than double the amount of refugees this year vs last year . 
  so really crimes go down . 
   i do n't know what to do with an extensive list of some 287 porn sites post em . 
  if 80 % of asylum seeker were woman instead of men public opinion might change . 
  some of them really do . 
  my impression is that a good 2 digit minority is rejecting the west even when they live here . 
  values like democracy and equality are just tolerated until they are n't a minority anymore , they really think that islam will become the worldreligion and they will call out some form of world goverment . 
  government and religion are very intertwined in islam , it 's interesting to read about . 
  it 's not random families . 
  the add campain is right in that it 's forced begging organized by international gangs .

  and for 2015 :  the refugees ' office had initially expected 450,000 asylum seekers in 2015 but had to revise its forecast to an unprecedented 500,000 people . 
  according to `` der tagesspiegel '' newspaper , unofficial `` internal numbers '' at bamf have estimated that germany will receive as many as 600,000 asylum applications in 2015 . http://www.dw.com/en/more-than-300000-refugees-seek-asylum-in-germany-in-2015-report/a-18622102, 
  aussiedler refering to germans who lived in german autonomous areas in russia/ukraine . 
  nice story . 
  germany did make a new tall ship for training the [ gorch fock . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorch_fock_%281958%29 ), 
  there was a city that wanted to do police patrols via street view , old people ca n't into technology . 
  germanies number is screwed by all the part time work . 
  it 's low paying work and a lot of people ca n't get anything else , leaving them in poverty . 
  there are [ civil unions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_germany ) in germany . 
  pretty much almost the same as marriage . 
  germany is n't pushing foss more like the opposite . 
  what reasons do you have ? 
  what ? 
  last i heard french banks did hold way more than german banks ... 
  the eu has cores over all of europe !, 
  pao is that you ? 
  wow someone here called it yesterday , i did n't believe them . 
  nah i do n't like italy . 
  great britain/ireland with japan . 
  [ they spent 2.7 in 2010 , 2.5 in 2011 , 2.4 in 2012 , 2.5 in 2013 and 2.2 in 2014 \\ ( % of gdp \\ ) ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs ) . 
  honestly military spending does n't seem like a big factor . 
  sitting in the back of the bus does n't work outside the us . 
  why would he give up a perk like that . 
  that 's not how far normal people think . 
  i do n't think it 's `` we will crush them '' and more of a `` now it 's not our problem anymore , problem solved '' . 
  the article doesn say why , but here are some impressions i have : the wars we were involved in are n't seen in a positiv light ( kosovo , afganistan ) . 
  the army is pretty much a mess and plagued by scandal after sacandal . 
  there is this `` damned if you do , damned if you do n't '' feel to geopolitics that we had for a while now . 
  i think people want to help just not in a military way . 
  can someone summarize ? 
  i ca n't read french and i 'm not interested enough to read 200 pages anyway . 
  yes that 's right , that 's `` a '' ... 
  indeed . 
  that 's bottom of the barrel humor . 
  they should make worldvision . 
  that river left of brittany must have been massive . 
  merkel wants as many options open as possible , this is just how she does politics . 
  do n't take this as an admission . 
  you can see the eu giving up it 's principles ? 
  ssh, 
  do n't bother the last thread everybody who came out and spoke his mind got shit on and downvoted to hell . 
  yes http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-myths-that-will-not-die/, 
  yes, 
  nothing , i feel the same way . 
  it 's just the german stereotype . 
  germans are never happy . 
  ah look who 's the idiot now ... me , fuck . 
  the lyrics did n't say any of that only that he rather bomb kurds then isis there is a english translation of the lyrics here : http://lyricstranslate.com/en/erdowie-erdowo-erdo%c4%9f-erdo-how-erdo-where-erdo%c4%9fun.html i doubt you will read it and just pretend that it said things it did n't, 
  that video was quite mild . 
  they have a dozen or so videos comparing people/groupes to nazies . 
  ups then it was alg1, 
  no you are thinking about alg2 . 
  what comic is that ? 
  i really doubt it . 
  nobody is going there . 
  preu\u00dfen does n't exist in peoples minds anymore . 
  it 's like they have forgotten about it . 
  this is like the 100th repost of this . 
  who expected anything different from france ? 
  i thought most countries made it clear that they do n't want any migrants . 
   right to enter europe there is no such right , who can and ca n't enter is written in law we just could n't enforce it against the masses that come every day . 
   the story of one syrian family heading for europe in search of a better life . 
   for the last two years , the dhnie family has been living as refugees in jordan . 
  in august , the family decided there was no future for them there and little prospect of returning to syria . 
  they packed up their lives and set off for the eu . 
  manveen rana documents the twists and turns of their journey in a series of reports for bbc radio 4 's the world at one . 
  they ended up in frankfurt 3 months ago . 
  last episode was on friday . 
  thanks , good to know . 
  there are crude ways but nothing without a 5 year margin . 
  this could n't have been a first time response there has to be more to it . 
  2016 will introduce a new issue that will make us all forget the old ones without solving any of them . 
   but an illiterate 25 year old afghan who speaks only farsi is n't going to get far without significant investment in education , integration and ausbildung . 
  to bad 70 % quit the apprenticeship right now . 
  http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article147608982/sieben-von-zehn-fluechtlingen-brechen-ausbildung-ab.html i attribute this to germanies overqualified job market . 
  even for simple work you need an ausbildung . 
  even if you will life in poverty after you finished it and work full time . 
  those are pretty much the only positions that are open for a big number of people . 
  why work full time to get about as much as the government gives you anyway . 
  no it was reported as if they were involved in the protest instead they just got some people together to do the photo . 
  making these good angle photos is what is common . 
  this is pretty common stuff : see [ one ] ( http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/media/thumbs/1/106be33fc2d69e096e851b1b4c40fc3fv1_abs_450x253_b3535db83dc50e27c1bb1392364c95a2.jpg ) [ two ] ( http://blog.tagesschau.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/paris_trauert2-kopie.jpg ) .

  migrants are always a net benefit because you only let in the people that will benefit you . 
  it 's interesting because the subsidies were 21bn as well from 2000 to 2014 . 
  but they payed for 136 gigawatt/hour from solar . 
  made germany a spearhead for renewables , built a great solar industrie ( that is now mostly bankrott and bought out by china ) and really it 's just part of the image now . 
  ca n't see the migrants to have a similar positiv impact and the cost is n't even final yet .
