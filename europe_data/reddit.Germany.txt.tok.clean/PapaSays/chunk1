nah , only old people old people are people too . 
   trying to lump russians , brits and spaniards yuropeans ? 
  do n't forget bbc world service , deutsche well and tv 5 . 
  all state financed . 
   stumbled https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cevd4maod3i, 
  and yet they are doing it . 
  how i know this ? 
  because it would be freakishly fucking careless if they would n't do it . 
  the deutsche bank ** is ** too big to fail . 
  there is no way they would let it fall . 
   spd : center ** former ** left folk partie to be more accurate, 
  i 've got a tv receiver with apparently literal translations of that . 
  if you want to record something you 'll have have to set once , daily , weekdays ( wochentage ) or weekly . 
  first time i used it i did n't understand the difference between daily and weekdays . 
  it was the first day of the week in germany as well . 
  until `` recently '' . 
  of course . 
  the eu has 28 states . 
  do the math . 
   sell their assets off , no . 
  does n't make sense . 
  expropriation is basically against all rule of laws in modern societies . 
  it would cost more than it is good for . 
   and make sure those responsible are indicted . 
  yes . 
  sad truth is not even that will happen in germany . 
  it is still good but the maintenance is shit . 
  a lot of old bridges etc were n't maintained well enough . 
  there is a big shitpile rolling unto us . 
  the elephant in the e-residency : do i have to defend estonia when the russians come ? 
  how many christians favour death penalty for gays ? 
   or is this more of an awareness/achievement thing than a practical technology ? 
  absolutely . 
  flight time , yeah . 
  all in all it took them ** 500 days ** !, 
  it 's kind of cop-out to say `` they had '' ( past tense ! ) . 
  they have n't anymore . 
  like a dead body . 
  so , if someone in a coma will never regain that abilities it is n't a human anymore ? 
  just asking if we should euthanize them ? 
  exactly like somebody in coma . 
  your point was ? 
  they list some examples of typical parasites . 
  i fail to see them mentioning foetuses . 
  i conclude , you pick some lines without context and interpret them as you like . 
  you do know that that is an opinion . 
  not necessarily a fact . 
  do you ? 
   look up the biological definition of ` parasite ' . 
  surpise !, 
  i did . 
  biology a plant or animal that lives in or on ** another type of animal ** and feeds on it . 
   australia , the alps everybody has heard of them https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_alps, 
  damn . 
  now i ca n't say anything about k\u00e4sek\u00f6pfe . 
   love you too, 
   `` read '' and `` read '' just remember * read rhymes with lead and read rhymes with lead , but read does n't rhyme with lead and read does n't rhyme with lead . 
  no actual reason for violence but you misspelled `` assistent '' . 
  spelled correctly google produces * predator food recapture intervalassistance two thousand *, 
  i learned that technically * you * is * sie * . 
  while * du * is * thou * . 
  now , that 's funny . 
  if you say in dutch . 
   it asinine to try framing this as sjw theory or some discriminatory equality of outcome lunacy ... mmmh . 
  trying to figure out what that means . 
  maybe i 'm too much coined by german law and the use of the word in my mother tongue ( pun intended ) . 
   bgb \u00a7 1591 motherhood   the mother of a child is the woman who gave birth to it . 
  that 's the whole paragraph . 
  self-explaining with its simplicity . 
  simplicity , something laws should strive for if it 's possible . 
   this is about equality of opportunity with respect for equal individual rights . 
  is it though ? 
  it is negating biological facts ** and ** societal concepts which survived aeons . 
  one is the birth/surrogate mother . 
  the other one is the biological mother . 
  the rest depends on the law . 
  eg in germany the birth mother is also the legal mother ( commonly known as the mother ) . 
  it 's longer , sounds stupid , and is an unnecessary complication of a perfect already existing word everybody understands . 
  what 's wrong with biological and adoptive mother ? 
   for example instead of `` mother '' , the words `` the person who gave birth to the child '' would be used . 
  wait , this shit has reached europe ? 
  any chance we can contain it on the islands before it reaches the continent ? 
   vienna-brastislava that should n't be a big problem . 
   i seriously do n't get why people think that . 
  i have only one explanation for this . 
  they are in a bubble . 
  almost every left and liberal leaning political activist considers this very important humans rights issue . 
  they convinced themselves that it is one of the most pressing issues of our time . 
  in the meantime in the real world only a small minority of voters would probably depend their vote on that issue . 
  the camera . 
  obviously !, 
  it 's an invasion of privacy . 
   my grandmother is french . 
  from molsheim well ... nevermind, 
  there are two reasons why the are considered tougher . 
  they are easier deployed . 
  when the american president deploys marines he is risking american lives . 
  not so much if have a foreign legion . 
  their lives are n't worth that much . 
  at least historically it was a `` safe haven '' for criminals .
