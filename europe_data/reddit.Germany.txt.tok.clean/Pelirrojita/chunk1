[ by your country 's legalistic jargon too , buddy . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_europe#slovak_republic ) never mind the drugs and alcohol , by the way . 
  can any finns comment on how likely this is to pass ? 
  it looks like it 's been debated frequently in the past few years with no progress , but then i 'm only looking at english media that might not reveal the whole picture . 
   you 're not european and never will be european . 
  nobody tell this guy about the vast numbers of americans with dual citizenship and pathways to naturalization , then ... 
  fully aware , which is why i said `` without aid or scholarships . '', 
   [ t ] he couple persuaded the boy that he should stay in the united states by promising to support him , including paying his tuition at harvard university . 
  it is n't likely he 'd already been admitted at age 16 , but even if he does n't get into harvard when the time comes , it sounds like he 's still got it made with financial support like that . 
  that 's $ 40k a year without aid or scholarships -- $ 60k if you throw in fees , room and board . 
  leaving his family and his country behind is probably still tough , though . 
  that 's not easy even when it does mean the promise of a better life . 
  [ berlin has a fee now . 
  ] ( http://www.kirchenaustritt.de/deutschland.htm ) only a minority of bundesl\u00e4ndern are still free . 
  the minute i saw the proposed new fee as a headline on the news in 2013 , i went to make my declaration the next day . 
  worth it . 
  sure , they win at times . 
  i 'm just used to being a us amazon prime shopper where it really does beat almost everyone on almost everything . 
  i 'm still getting used to non-discount-superstore , brick-and-mortar places beating the giants . 
  i think i saved a few euros on some two-ring binders with it at most . 
  my most recent ( new ) phone was still cheaper on ebay . 
  i mentioned that book pricing is controlled . 
  prime is also a thing here but i was spoiled from having a free student account in the us . 
  i also notice that the us price for prime has been steadily climbing . 
  i used to use free prime for * everything * but it 's just not what it used to be . 
  when i shopped at wal-mart or amazon.com in the us , i always knew i was choosing my lower price over the worker 's wages and rights . 
  it 's a trade-off and a choice i felt guilty about making and tried to minimize as much as i could . 
  but amazon.de does n't even win on price . 
  and i 'm comparing this not just to us amazon , but to brick-and-mortar retail * in germany * . 
  a name-brand skincare product i just bought ? 
  14 % cheaper at dm for the same thing , same brand , same size . 
  new books ? 
  price controlled . 
  used books ? 
  shipping eats away your savings when you could just go to a used bookstore . 
  i sat down with a spreadsheet of foods i usually buy ( coconut milk , rice , pasta , various canned goods , etc. ), 
  at lidl , kaisers , and kaufland to see if i could get better deals on amazon , which usually worked out in the us . 
  no savings here . 
  not even buying in bulk , not even when i hit the free shipping threshold . 
  who is actually making money out of this ? 
  i do n't understand how they can be ripping off their workers so bad if their prices are n't even competitive . 
  i know an ungodly number of people who fight this stereotype daily . 
  our trains and public transportation often help . 
  germany too , if you can believe that . 
  we can usually find one or two brands in what i consider to be small amounts . 
  then i go to the uk/us and see cheese aisles that are half cheddar and i weep . 
  some of the more continental cheeses my german inlaws eat are enough to make me queasy just by smelling them . 
  the fact that they 'd rather eat these than cheddar puzzles me , but i know it 's all a question of acquired taste . 
  a lot of us gay bars started [ boycotting russian vodka ] ( http://www.dumprussianvodka.com/ ) as soon as russia 's new anti-lgbt laws came into effect last year . 
  some demonstrations involved pouring leftover stolichnaya into gutters . 
  stoli for international export actually comes from latvia , though , so i 'm not sure how i feel about this one . 
  they will still speak a shit ton of german , no worries . 
  this plan refers to master 's programs at one university that already offered about a third of its master 's programs in english anyway , and involves switching [ `` most , '' not all , of the rest by 2020 ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20140724/for-a-masters-in-munich-english-required ) . 
  the eisenhower interstate highway system emerged in the 1950s , and like nasa and the space race , it has part of its roots in the cold war ( quicker evacuation routes , long straights of pavement to land planes on , etc. ) . 
  a huge part of [ the $ 500 + billion economic stimulus package of 2009 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_recovery_and_reinvestment_act_of_2009 ) was focused on maintaining the interstates and other infrastructure , but the biggest reason why these roads are threatened now is that [ the us gas tax has n't been updated since the 90s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highway_trust_fund ) , making the whole thing unsustainable . 
  so it 's not all `` let 's build everything in the 30s and let it rot for a hundred years , '' but the reality is n't looking too bright either . 
  kerfluffle , then . 
  embarrassment . 
  mistake . 
  it proved beyond doubt that obama made a shitty , corrupt decision to support his bankrollers rather than anyone who could 've been even halfway competent at the job . 
  it 's a typical move and it 's * by far * not the worst thing he 's ever done , but i was pretty disappointed , and it was a kind of bittersweet progress when even the democrats called him on his bullshit and refused to confirm the man . 
  not sure now , but for a few years after 9/11 it was likely to get you questioned . 
  not arrested , but shooed off . 
  the verrazano definitely still has `` no photography '' signs on it . 
  fear of terrorism , old infrastructure , possibility to look for structural weaknesses , etc. 
  and with our congress * to this day * refusing to fund infrastructural investment by maintaining a reasonable gas tax , i totally understand it . 
  it may be typical , but just like with many things in life , a lot of people do n't realize it 's typical if they have no experience with it themselves . 
  i certainly did n't always know it , and then one day i was part of the [ lucky 10,000 ] ( http://xkcd.com/1053/ ) . 
  it was tongue-in-cheek , yes . 
  the place is always guarded both by german cops and embassy security , and you are allowed to take no electronics whatsoever past the security checkpoint . 
  i imagine that a random person trying to take pictures of the place would get the guards ' attention ( rightfully so ? 
  ) , but i do n't know that for a fact , and i do n't know that it 's illegal under any law . 
  i do know that for some time , it was considered suspicious and could lead to questioning if you took pictures of certain structures within the us -- nyc bridges are the specific example i know about -- so that 's why i made the connection . 
  i just checked for the first time and it shows up clearly on google maps street view but i 'm sort of surprised ( but relieved ! ), 
  by that . 
  they 're not two distinct embassies , but they 're two buildings of the same embassy separated by a few km . 
  the clayallee facility in west berlin is officially a branch of the [ embassy in the english language ] ( http://germany.usembassy.gov/acs/berlinacs/ ) and the [ konsular * abteilung * der botschaft ] ( http://germany.usembassy.gov/acs/berlinacs/ ) in german . 
  the fact that one provides acs and visa services does n't make it a consulate . 
  i 'd show you the pictures of the big sign that says `` embassy '' over the west berlin one if that were the kind of thing you could take pictures of without mysteriously disappearing . 
  right , as far as i understand , both buildings in the capital city are , officially , [ the embassy ] ( http://germany.usembassy.gov/acs/ ) , one of which covers acs/consular services . 
  pure consulates are everything outside the capital : frankfurt , munich , etc. 
  side note : i had the misfortune of meeting our last ambassador at an election event my high school english students were invited to . 
  the man butchered two lines of german he read off an index card , gave a vapid speech in english , and let his subordinate do all the actual interacting with the germans . 
  it made the whole [ norwegian ambassador scandal ] ( http://www.npr.org/2014/06/17/323032817/the-would-be-ambassador-to-norway-whos-never-been-there-himself ) come as no surprise . 
  i really do have no idea what productive things they do all day . 
  i 've yet to find out what exactly they do at `` the '' us embassy in berlin . 
  there are actually two embassy buildings . 
  the second one is way out in suburban west berlin where enclaves of americans have lived for decades ( the american international school is out there , for instance ) , and * that 's * where you actually have to go for visas and for citizen services like passport renewals , notarial services , marriage and birth registries , etc. 
  when you make an appointment , they specifically say not to go to the one by the brandenburg gate . 
  my only guess is that `` the '' embassy pictured here really is just for show and for spying . 
  ( edit : my wording was inexact . 
  berlin has an embassy in two buildings , the big one and the [ annex ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/embassy_of_the_united_states,_berlin#1990.e2.80.93present ) . 
  the annex handles consular services but is not itself a consulate ; it 's officially part of the embassy . ), 
   germany takes aim at ** foreign ** drivers with car toll  germany plans to introduce a car toll that seeks to make money from the millions of ** foreigners ** who drive through the country every year , the transport minister said monday . 
   german drivers wo n't pay more overall . 
   many worry the system wo n't be compatible with european union law because ** only foreign car owners will pay more ** . 
   [ the csu ] insisted on introducing a car toll for ** foreigners ** so german-registered cars get a loophole but everyone else still pays more . 
  sorry for my wording but the question still stands . 
  do any other countries do this ? 
  i was referring to the fact that this car toll is specifically only levied on certain nationalities .
