  no , i do n't think all buses and trains are free . 
  i 'm not stupid . 
   germany has a truck toll but , unlike many european countries , no car toll . 
  no car here , so no firsthand experience . 
  is it really true that other european countries have ** nationality-based tolls ** already ? 
  which ones ? 
  it seems like this is totally incompatible with freedom of movement , whether it 's germany doing it or any other member state . 
  ( ** edit ** because i was n't clear . 
  of course many countries have general tolls but that 's not what makes this new proposal negatively unique . ), 
  because actual immigration proceedings are too boring and confusing to make for good tv , yet weddings get ratings . 
  nobody ever files their tax returns in tv shows either . 
  to piggyback onto this , though , when i grew up in north carolina , 6th grade european history meant ancient greece and rome , fast forward to renaissance/reformation , world wars , the end . 
  and that 's the only * required * european history we had . 
  12th grade ap euro ( kind of like a-levels ) was optional and covered only renaissance to modern day , but with much more depth . 
  it focused mostly on the big movers and shakers nationality-wise , which meant we never learned a lick about portugal , ireland , the nordic countries , or literally anything between germany and russia . 
  on the other hand , i was forced through two years ( 4th and 8th grade ) of north carolina history , which is utterly useless to me now as someone who moved far , far away and is n't going back . 
  perhaps a system with a more holistic or european focus could 've spent that time on something else . 
  ai n't just the middle-aged ... 
  uber is the car service you 're thinking of ( or at least , it 's one of them ) . 
  you hail a person via mobile app , and they pick you up and give you a ride , as opposed to other carsharing services where you just borrow a car and drive yourself . 
  the problem is that the drivers are treated as independent contractors and are n't required to have commercial licenses or special insurance or to be given benefits by the company . 
  your driver gets in an accident ? 
  * they 're * on the hook , not the company . 
  so ( in my opinion ) , it 's not just taxi drivers starting a turf war , it 's sub-legal companies skirting tax and safety requirements and shifting liability onto the workers . 
  i appreciate pisa 's potential for pointing out where school systems may have room for improvement , and i think it 's interesting how this year 's results refute negative stereotypes about immigration dragging some countries down . 
  what makes me really hesitant about pisa , though , is its reduction of entire nations ( or sometimes regions ) and cultures into numbers . 
  having taught in the us and germany , i 've been privy to `` how can we be more like finland ? '', 
  as well as `` east asia may have better scores than us , but we produce more creative , independent thinkers '' staff meetings in both countries . 
  and as with ** intra ** national testing ( no child left behind , anyone ? 
  ) , teachers are left with the impression that the responsibility of raising these scores is on our shoulders , regardless of national or regional policies beyond our influence . 
  pisa results in a lot of flag-waving and pearl-clutching , but very few education leaders seem to know how to apply these results in constructive ways . 
  the goal should n't be raising pisa scores like it 's some kind of competition ; it should be educating students in ways that improve their societies -- but the competition aspect is usually what prevails . 
  it 's true . 
  about 10 years ago our government had to design a separate curriculum for integration classes for people in this exact situation .

  we have a great many posts along the lines of :  i 'm a monolingual american in my late teens or twenties with no relevant job skills . 
  pls help me into london ( specifically ) or berlin ( specifically ) or scandinavia ( i 've heard the whole thing is pretty cool ) . 
  i 've never been to these places but i 'm * sooo * sick of america ; it 's truly ruined and i hate the entire country . 
  i should have bonus points because of my german great-grandma , right ? 
  it is a very , very similar mindset . 
  full disclosure , i am an immigrant who had somewhat similar ideas in my teens but now i actually try to help people sort out the realities of moving here . 
  in so doing , i probably come across as a pessimistic bitch most of the time . 
  better me than a border officer or tax collector , though . 
   do you think the german of the aslan families father in the video is sufficient for somebody that lives in germany for 20 years ? 
  `` adequate '' is currently defined in the aufentg as b1 competence . 
  this is less than what gymnasium students are expected to achieve in their foreign languages by graduation . 
  but [ half of the people in the state 's under-funded integrationskurse fail to reach even b1 ] ( http://www.bamf.de/de/infothek/statistiken/inge/datenbund/daten-bund-node.html ) at the end of the course . 
  those who fail can face having their aufenthaltstitel not renewed , but even if successful , once the paperwork has been filed and the applicant is granted a renewal or citizenship or permanent residency , there 's no follow-up test ever . 
  it 's entirely possible to `` cram '' for a language test and then forget everything by not using the language in your daily life . 
  yes , i think it 's shameful that the state accepts this , but they do . 
  as a foreigner who worked my ass off to reach the c2 level , i would n't find it unreasonable at all to step up this requirement . 
  [ denmark just raised theirs to b2 ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/20150825/denmark-considers-changes-to-citizenship-requirements ) . 
  my ideal language policy would involve a b2 minimum , reinstating/increasing the language requirements for familiennachzug ( currently a1 by law and [ 0 by court order ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/familiennachzug-sprachtest-kein-dauerhindernis-mehr-fuer-eheleben/10308610.html ) ) and * way * more investment in the entire integrationskurs scheme . 
  [ the current state of affairs is woeful for everyone involved ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/karriere/berufsleben/deutsch-fuer-auslaender-integrationslehrer-verdienen-wenig-a-1050672.html ) . 
  but you can vote , and i ca n't yet . 
  maybe drop your representative a line sometime . 
   do you think that this father is raising his children with a proper understanding of the the german constituation [ sic ] and values ? 
  again : what do you do , ask for a pinky-promise when taking the citizenship oath ? 
  citizenship is n't the even end game for everyone in this country and for them , there 's no oath to be pinky-promised anyway . 
  plenty of people live here for decades and raise families without naturalizing . 
   have this family investigated by the jugendamt . 
  that is what it 's there for , yes . 
  but if no one makes the call , how are they supposed to know what 's said and done in people 's private homes ? 
  a statement like this makes me think you are not actually familiar with our country 's laws on citizenship . 
  you are calling for something that pretty much already exists . 
  [ nationality act , section 10 , ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/gesetzestexte/en/staatsangehoerigkeitsgesetz_englisch.pdf ) emphases added . 
  ( 1 ) a foreigner who has been legally ordinarily resident in germany for eight years and possesses legal capacity pursuant to section 80 of the residence act or has a legal representative shall be naturalized upon application if he or she \\ 1 .

  ** possesses knowledge of the legal system , society and living conditions in germany ( nb : this involves a test in german at the applicant 's own expense . 
  ) ** this is what all foreigners have to go through in order to gain german citizenship , no matter where we come from . 
  very few exceptions are ever made , and when they are , they 're usually for shortened length of residency requirements due to excellent ( c1/c2 ) german language skills , or on point 4 because not every country allows citizenship renunciation . 
  a german passport does n't magically arrive in the mail once you 've lived here long enough , and they do n't come attached to children 's birth certificates either . 
  what else can you do ? 
  make the applicant pinky-promise that they * really mean it * when taking their oath ? 
  thank you . 
  it makes my head spin when i constantly see top-voted comments like the one above yours . 
  `` they should have to learn our language , culture , and laws !, 
  but if you say this , you get called a nazi !!! 1 ! '', 
  actually , we 've had mandatory integration courses teaching all of these things for over a decade . 
  maybe * you * should inform yourself about this country 's laws . 
  '' ... yeah well ... yeah well ... they 'll never * really * be german anyway . '', 
  ah , there 's the true prejudice we were all waiting for . 
  this is a big gamble when very long conflicts are involved . 
  let 's say the syrian civil war rages on for a couple of decades . 
  it would n't be the first time such a thing has happened in that part of the world . 
  in the meantime , we ca n't just distribute condoms to the first generation and then hope for the best . 
  after a few years , you 've got thousands of young residents in your country who 've only ever experienced life in a segregated refugee camp . 
  what now ? 
  ** you say `` screw it '' : ** they remain segregated , unintegrated , and in limbo on into the next generation and the next . 
  ** you say `` let them apply like everyone else '' : ** if you 're leaving this avenue open at all , it would 've been a better idea to pour resources into integrating them from day one . 
  ** you say `` too bad , send 'em back '' : ** ca n't happen . 
  some judge somewhere will rule that it 's a violation of the children 's rights and the whole family can stay . 
  even if you * did * issue a blanket deportation order , you 'd have to physically enforce it somehow , and not everyone will comply . 
  all of this is already happening .
