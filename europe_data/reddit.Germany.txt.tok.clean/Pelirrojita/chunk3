  for what it 's worth , germany does too . 
  so the better solution is ... do n't let them earn income ? 
  make them sit unemployed on public support in camps forever ? 
  ( how would their subsidies not be included by the tax , anyway ? ), 
  or send them back and just let them support the dictatorship more directly ? 
  we must be talking at cross purposes . 
  * of course * this tax is a despicable joke . 
  anyone who knows the first thing about it knows why it exists and what it funds . 
  but the fact of the matter is that most people do n't pay it . 
  most of those who do , do so only when they need services from that state . 
  your own articles say so . 
  if the countries giving eritreans asylum really wanted to stop this money from flowing , they 'd stop with the strongly worded letters and just waive most paperwork requirements that would force eritreans to interact with their corrupt consulates . 
  you should n't need to pay the death camp of a country you just fled to give you a passport , just so that the the asylum-granting country you fled to can put a stamp or sticker in it . 
  that paperwork catch-22 is still not the same as the us ordering institutions in all other sovereign states in the world that they must directly report to them on 7 + million people 's finances , many of whom are dual citizens of those other sovereign states . 
  the affected individuals are n't going to be killed over it . 
  and in that respect , it * is * apples and oranges . 
  but it 's still a deeply suspect move that would n't fly if any other country tried it , and that should concern people . 
  tl ; dr - both situations suck . 
  the eritrean situation undoubtedly sucks more . 
  but we 've got to solve that problem somehow . 
  forced how ? 
  it 's not like these folks got exit visas and have registered their activity with that oppressive government . 
  they 're out now . 
  germany 's not going to collect that tax on eritrea 's behalf , and eritrea has very little ability to pressure germany in any way . 
  there is one larger , more economically powerful country that also taxes its citizens abroad and [ * does * have enough clout to get foreign banks to help report them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_account_tax_compliance_act ) . 
  but eritrea ai n't it . 
  and for the many millions of people in europe who * do n't * live in the countries where they were born ? 
  those who *** really did *** have to work hard to gain the right to live here , and even more importantly , to integrate ? 
  i guess it 's very easy to be blas\u00e9 about your country when it has handed everything to you since birth . 
  ** but if i ever gain citizenship , it 's going to be one of the proudest damn days of my life . 
  ** until then , i 'll just have to keep my head down as an eeevil non-european whose right to remain is at the whims of governments taking collective hard-right turns . 
   maybe in a day or two the mods will include it in a link in the immigration megathread part iv . 
  two days later : it 's listed twice in megathread ** v ** . 
  this is all going so well . 
  and it 's been posted twice within the megathread ( s ) , so even when people do discuss it , it 's split . 
  brilliant . 
  this is the translated version of [ the cover/featured article from last week 's print version of * der spiegel * ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/index-2015-31.html ) . 
  so trust me , even if it does n't look like it from these godawful threads , at least a million german print copies are currently in circulation . 
  looking at this ( which i 've seen before elsewhere ) , i ca n't help but feel that the giant eu one is disingenuous when it comes to the `` known to ancients '' set . 
  as if no other civilization had figured out iron , gold , lead ... 
  not even just `` somewhat poorer countries . '', 
  literally anywhere outside of the eu . 
  american ? 
  japanese ? 
  australian ? 
  have fun at the immigration office with everyone else . 
  hope you do n't need an interpreter . 
  hope the degree you earned is relevant . 
  hope you found housing and a job on your own before you got off the plane . 
  hope your paperwork 's perfect . 
  hope you meet all economic and financial thresholds we keep tightening . 
  if not , gtfo . 
  the thing is , she goes with whatever she thinks will be the most politically successful . 
  for a cdu politician , that 's not clear right now . 
  i ca n't find any english sources on this ( after an admittedly weak googling ) , but there 's internal strife in the party right now about whether or not same-sex marriage should be legalized . 
  some are dead-set against , some are enough in favor to have marched in our pride parade in berlin for several years . 
  [ there 's an internal survey going on in the berlin branch of the party right now ] ( http://www.rbb-online.de/politik/beitrag/2015/07/briefumfrage-der-berliner-cdu-zu-homo-ehe-endet.html ) to see how they should officially proceed . 
  merkel may quietly align with however that turns out , if she sees this as a relevant test of the waters . 
  if she `` evolves '' like obama did , great . 
  it 'd then sail through the bundestag , since literally every other party has already been in favor for years now . 
  and it 'd be about damn time . 
   their only argument is that a hetero couples can have children and they want to support that by granting tax releases . 
  which is amazing , because merkel * personally * is married , chose to have zero children , and still gets tax advantages . 
  if procreation is seriously supposed to be the foundation of marriage , then she 's a fraud . 
  enough to have signed off on it . 
  the only thing that really could 've hit me hard was the self employment tax , which [ ca n't be lowered by the foreign earned income exclusion ] ( http://taxes.about.com/od/taxhelp/a/foreignincome_5.htm ) . 
  i initially thought i was on the hook for a few thousand dollars until i figured out how social security totalization works and spent a few weeks hunting for paperwork from the german side of things . 
  i can see how some people would give up at that point and enlist the help of an advisor or accountant , and i can see how an accountant who knows the us and german laws well could charge an arm and a leg . 
  but really , it was n't that bad . 
  just a lot of research , patience , and paperwork on my part . 
  the berlin chapter of democrats abroad also runs an open consultation with one attorney and one accountant with just such expertise every year , where they work on a volunteer basis for an evening . 
  i asked , and apparently everything i did was right . 
  i do , and it was $ 14 for me to file last year with taxact . 
  and that was n't even the plain old ez form : i 'm self-employed , have retirement savings , and met the fbar filing threshold , for example . 
  all of which makes things trickier . 
  it was n't particularly easy or pleasant , but it was n't expensive . 
   the german system might be just what we need . 
  there 's immense upward pressure for kids to get their abitur and go to uni even if they have no idea what they want to do in life . 
  trades do n't have the same `` pull '' that they used to , and there can be social stigma around going that route . 
  jobs that did n't use to require a degree are starting to `` prefer '' one in help wanted ads . 
  sound familiar ? 
  i really only see english-language media praising `` the german system '' these days . 
  germany itself is sort of panicked about [ underfunded and overfilled universities ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2015/24/unisystem-protest-wissenschaftler ) and a [ hemorrhaging of young people out of the trades ] ( http://www.noz.de/deutschland-welt/wirtschaft/artikel/515569/regionalem-handwerk-fehlt-der-nachwuchs ) . 
  grass is always greener , etc. 
  there 's a whole lot of armchair second language acquisition theory in this post that needs unpacking . 
   it 's hard in a school , because most school [ sic ] are n't adapted to adults . 
  there is generally a separate route of teacher training for language teachers who work with adults rather than children . 
  the classrooms are also in separate environments , and there is a separate curriculum . 
  no adult migrant ends up sitting in a classroom of second graders , and none of them start with nursery rhymes . 
  many course offerings are also in the evenings after work hours . 
  i 'm not sure in what way this is `` not adapted to adults . '', 
   give them a part time job where they enforced [ sic ] to listen to your language and the problem is magically going [ sic ] away . 
  if listening were all it took , we 'd need very few teachers worldwide ( and i 'd personally have solid basic mandarin from my time in china ) . 
  the first problem is that [ passive understanding \\ ( listening/reading \\ ) and active speech production ( speaking/writing ) are different skills ] ( http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayabstract?frompage=online&amp;aid=1662608&amp;fileid=s0272263108080042 ) . 
  ask a b2 speaker to watch a film in their second language , and they 'll get the gist . 
  ask them to orally summarize the film without notes or a dictionary and all of a sudden the `` gist '' does n't cut it anymore . 
  the second problem is that adult l2 learners are often insensitive to certain aspects of morphosyntax , and that this problem is * magnified * by a lack of explicit instruction . 
  take the german case and gender systems : four cases , [ three largely opaque genders ] ( http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayabstract?frompage=online&amp;aid=9721358&amp;fileid=s1366728914000534 ) , marked on articles and adjectives , with plurals sort of doing their own thing . 
  l2 speakers latch onto content words . 
  in a phrase like `` ein rotes buch , '' i 'd get the gist on `` buch '' alone .
