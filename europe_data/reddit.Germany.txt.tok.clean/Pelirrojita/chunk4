  but this is actually a singular , neuter , nominative , indefinite phrase . 
  i 'd struggle immensely to figure out how to get from here to `` einem roten buch '' or `` die roten b\u00fccher '' or `` ein roter rock '' or `` die rote gabel '' on the basis of spoken input alone . 
  another example is english [ tense-aspect violations ] ( http://slr.sagepub.com/content/29/4/413.short ) , as in `` the problem magically goes away '' versus `` is magically going away . '', 
  explicit instruction allows learners to formalize [ strategies for processing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sentence_processing ) these things . 
  it just takes a while for this processing to become automatic . 
   it 's much easier to learn a language by daily listening and practice . 
  i agree ... and this is why integrationskurse ( and similar programs ) are on a highly regular basis and contain lots of listening practice . 
  would more native speaker interaction and input help ? 
  of course !, 
  can incidental ( not explicit ) learning occur ? 
  yes !, 
  are these two things sufficient on their own ? 
  that 's a pretty bold assumption to base national immigration , integration , and language policy on , and the [ evidence is not in its favor ] ( https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/forschungsberichte/fb11-integrationspanel.html ) . 
  ** tl ; dr - why not both ? 
  i have no idea . 
  in most countries i think they 're barred from working while they wait for decisions on their individual cases . 
  in that respect , i can imagine not wanting to spend hundreds of hours learning danish/german/x if you 're still not sure if you 'll be permitted to stay in denmark/germany/x . 
  ( or if you plan to hop a truck to the uk with your rudimentary english anyhow , but i 'll leave that alone . ), 
  and the aforementioned `` why bother '' effect of being surrounded by an isolated community of speakers of your native language still does n't help . 
  but no , none of this answers the `` what do they do all day '' question . 
  i am an immigrant myself and i am constantly baffled by people who do n't give their all to learning their new country 's language . 
  i 'm baffled when ( some ! ), 
  well-off academics and businesspeople do n't do it , and i 'm baffled when ( some ! ), 
  recognized refugees do n't do it . 
  it is the single most direct way to increase your career prospects and make your new life a lot less limited . 
  in any given year on average , only a small majority ( ~ 53 % ) of people taking state-subsidized german integration courses pass the required b1 language exam ( [ pdf , p. 121 ] ( https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2013.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) ) . 
  and that 's dealing with regular migration rather than asylum cases . 
  learning a second language as an adult is hard . 
  learning a second language as an adult when you may only have minimal formal education from your home country is harder -- perhaps you never even learned to read , or your native language has another writing system . 
  moreover , committing to that new language when you can just surround yourself in a community of speakers of your native language anyway can feel pointless unless immigration threatens to stop renewing your visas because of it . 
  ( just ask the many english-speaking expats who never get much beyond basic german , and they do n't even have the assorted hardship arguments to hide behind . ), 
  despite the depressing results -- and failing a b1 exam after living in a country for * years * is truly depressing -- i still think programs like this need to exist . 
  if countries offer nothing of the sort , that can only lead to worse problems . 
  `` nobody 's talking about x '' has become my most detested clickbait pet peeve . 
  nobody 's talking about ttip and tisa ? 
  these [ 10.6 million google results ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=tisa&amp;rlz=1c1chfx_enus544us544&amp;oq=tisa ) are all about the obscure fruit and clothing label , then ? 
  we have n't discussed this multiple times [ in this very sub ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=tisa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) ? 
  it has n't made the front page of any media anywhere ... ? 
  that 's not actually what `` no child left behind '' is about , though . 
  nclb is a federal law that introduced state standardized testing schemes with the goal of narrowing achievement gaps ( among races , classes , etc. ) . 
  the children getting `` left behind '' in this scenario are/were the children languishing in sub-par , underfunded schools . 
  it was n't about little timmy getting a basketball trophy even though he 's the worst kid on the team . 
  it was about setting high standards for other timmy in a bad neighborhood where only 20 % of the kids graduate high school . 
  it 's failing miserably and backfiring in about a thousand ways , but that was the original idea , at least . 
  mostly yes , a little no . 
  there are different tiers of residency requirements for non-spouses , sp\u00e4taussiedler are still in a league of their own , some countries are exempt from the renunciation clause , senior citizens can be exempt from the tests , and by law the whole process is at the discretion of whatever beamte oversee your case anyway . 
  but yes , if the comparison is between buying citizenship elsewhere in the eu versus legit naturalization in germany ( with or without with a german spouse ) , the point stands that a millionaire is gon na have an easier time with option a. 
  and option a gives you the irrevocable right to live and work in germany anyway , so ... 
  it 's part of german law , and it 's backwards as hell if you ask me . 
  germany goes out of its way to prevent multiple citizenship cases , including forcing some german youth with immigrant parents to renounce one citizenship at a certain age . 
  but even with dual citizenship as such a dire threat to the republic , there are ways to gain dual citizenship for life in certain cases , including if you 're born german and naturalize elsewhere and file one extra form . 
  my husband could become a dual citizen with my home country , and if i do n't naturalize before we have kids then they 'll be dual citizens for life , but i probably never can be , because that makes perfect sense . 
  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af i 'm actually not going to open my case until i learn of the decision for someone else who is applying with an exception to the renunciation clause ( which i 'd also qualify for ) . 
  it 's too complicated and off-topic for this thread , but i thank you for the well-wishes nevertheless . 
  people often have some pretty inaccurate ideas about what rights one gains through international marriage . 
  as someone qualifying for citizenship this year through my spouse , here 's what i 'm looking at . 
  ( obviously other eu states do this differently , but often not by much . ), 
  * marriage itself took over six months to process because so many civil servants and judges had to review my papers , during which time i already had to have some other form of legal residency * authorities are known to do house visits and call upon third party testimony to prove the nature of the relationship * naturalization takes a minimum of three years of residency , at least two of which must be within the marriage * must pass an intermediate german language exam ( at my own cost ) * must pass a german culture and civics exam administered by the state ( at my own cost again ) * must be able to prove years of contributions into the german social security/pension scheme * must be able to prove that i can support myself without taking welfare ( and that i have not taken welfare already during my residency ) * must renounce my original citizenship ( at my own cost again ) if i do n't go through with this , then my visa renewals or upgrade to `` permanent '' residence status ( which is revoked if i leave the country for six months ) is contingent on staying married . 
  that 'd be quite the long con . 
  if you ask me , the investment path seems a lot easier , especially if you were born with a silver spoon anyway . 
  believe me , i know , and this is what i do . 
  it 's also what i 've seen my friends do at least half the time . 
  but the weirdos are apparently out there in larger numbers than we realized . 
  i did n't grow up in germany but immigrated years ago . 
  my first experience learning german was in high school in the us . 
  we once watched a silly little dialogue video where some friends were making pizza in ridiculously basic german . 
  they put ketchup on it . 
  the whole class was outraged . 
  the teacher was also american and she could n't tell us whether it was supposed to be a joke . 
  moved to germany . 
  invited to a friend 's house for a homemade pizza night . 
  ketchup confirmed . 
  i tried so hard to eat it and i just could n't . 
  ( edit : [ got curious and found the video . 
  ] ( https://vimeo.com/58195785#t=1m40s ) ah , memories ... ), 
   germany does not even have an immigration law/policy that claim makes less than no sense . 
  it 's been around for more than a decade . 
  it covers everything from asylum to student visas to the blue card to family reunification ... really , everything . 
  it also established mandatory integration courses . 
  if we had no immigration laws , on what grounds would any foreigner be able to get a visa ? 
  you really think every foreigner in the country simply crossed the border and was allowed to stay and work from day one ? 
  lutherans and anglicans of various stripes mostly kept it , but not others . 
  ever been to a service at some of the larger denominations in the southern us ( baptist , methodist , etc. ) ? 
  straight-up grape juice in a paper cup on special occasions only , having lord 's supper ( communion ) every week is just too catholic ... 
  true , but that figure represents just iraqis issued visas in the last 3 months . 
  most people applying for asylum in germany are not iraqi . 
  [ ** nor is the majority syrian , for that matter ** ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201512-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) , but that 's a whole ` nother problem . 
  that 's twice the number of people that germany was able to deport . 
  the la times article notes this too . 
  both sources are in german ( sorry ) but the numbers and country names are pretty easy to understand in context . 
   rotate in their graves ( german saying ) '' [ roll over/turn over in one 's grave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turn_in_one%27s_grave ) '' is also an english saying . 
  gang support and other informal networks . 
  nobody 's on their own in the black market . 
  if fun festivals and foods were all it came down to , i 'd be right there with you . 
  however ... 
  those numbers reflect submitted applications only . 
  the applications themselves take months to file due to processing delays and backlogs . 
  there are hundreds of thousands of people waiting and a lawsuit pending as a result . 
  [ 1.1 million people physically crossed the border and were sent to first reception centers ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article150678614/1-1-millionen-fluechtlinge-kamen-2015-nach-deutschland.html ) . 
  they 're just caught up in paperwork hell , and the bamf knows this .
