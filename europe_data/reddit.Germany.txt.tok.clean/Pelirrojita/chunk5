  [ this was literally at the top of / r/germany ** yesterday ** . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/45vry1/cologne_only_three_out_of_58_men_arrested_in/ ) british re-hash of german sources because / r/germany is english-speaking and / r/de is not . 
  cologne 's prosecutor had to [ specifically address the erroneous claims that only 3 of those arrested were asylum seekers ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4d8372a4077144cdbd67e4f630d23c47/cologne-prosecutor-majority-suspects-are-asylum-seekers ) because that rumor started circulating so fast . 
  this was also ** yesterday ** . 
  many other german sources have since updated their web articles , often without displaying a record of the changes . 
  people review several sourced in the first thread i linked from / r/germany . 
  bento ( spiegel ) , faz , and die welt are involved . 
  german press scrubs itself when called out . 
  english press * about * germany is slower to react to these changes because there are fewer reporters working that beat . 
  ( update to clarify/remove something i could n't back up as written . 
  i explain the details extensively in my next post below . ), 
  loudspeakers , intercom , video screen , etc. 
  the male does n't have to be in the room . 
  a lot of mosques also have a balcony ( often with a screen or small wall in front ) so that the women are in the * same * room but not visible from the floor where the men pray . 
  you can see this in several of the pictures of [ this mosque in berlin ] ( http://www.beautifulmosque.com/sehitlik-mosque-berlin-germany ) . 
   not everything is synchronized unfortunately i know a lot of american and european women who still believe in the myth of menstrual synchrony . 
  confirmation bias dies hard ... 
  [ seven different states have elections in 2016 and 4 of them are indeed next month ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/termine.htm ) , so you 're not wrong . 
  but when people talk about merkel losing her job or big shake-ups in national policy , that 's the bit that will have to wait a while . 
  our national elections are late next year , and people 's attention spans are short . 
  i do n't see a connection . 
  the vector in this case ( mosquitoes , not other humans ) makes this unfortunately unlikely . 
  we have n't eradicated malaria yet either , and we 've sunk a lot more time , money , and research into that . 
  mosquitoes are a bitch . 
  there was a measles outbreak in my city last year that ultimately infected at least 1400 people and accounted for more than half of all cases in the country . 
  it started in a refugee shelter , but it did n't stop there . 
  vaccinated or not , people take the same public transportation as you , sit in the same doctor/hospital waiting rooms as you , and send their kids to the same schools and daycares as you . 
  even if there were a 100 % implementation rate in camps and shelters , immunity takes months to be established in the meantime . 
  mmr/v is a multi-dose vaccine , and so 's tdap . 
  there certainly are native germans who do n't get their kids vaccinated ( though more for bullshit woo-woo reasons than religious observance ) . 
  but that just makes things worse . 
  the presence of non-refugee unvaccinated communities is an extra part of the problem , not evidence that there is no problem . 
  yes , seen as a whole , the chances of being infected are low . 
  but the stakes can be high , and it 's so easy to prevent that there 's no real excuse . 
  ** you . 
  yes , you . 
  anyone reading this . 
  ** grab your [ impfpass/carte jaune ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carte_jaune ) and make sure it 's up to date . 
  get any boosters you need . 
  do it . 
  ** i do n't care if you had all your shots as a baby . 
  ** if you get your bloodwork tested , you may be surprised to find that you 're still not as immune as you think . 
  last year , i had to have my [ tdap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dpt_vaccine ) and my [ mmrv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mmrv_vaccine ) refreshed for this reason . 
  despite my childhood shots , i had low immunity to four out of those seven diseases . 
  ** i do n't care if you personally do not interact with asylum seekers ** or never travel abroad . 
  the herd immunity that protects * all of us * can be seriously damaged when a new population of millions of un-vaccinated or under-vaccinated people moves in . 
  ** why is this important to me ? 
  i 'm pregnant . 
  ** measles could cause horrible birth defects if it were to spread to me right now . 
  and if , god willing , the child is born healthy ? 
  s/he still ca n't get vaccinated for the whole first year of life . 
  that 's a whole year of vulnerability to this and other shitty diseases . 
  ** please go do it . 
  what 's foster care like in the uk ? 
  are there enough people of good will who would stand up and take in the kids growing up in these horrible environments if the parents were indeed jailed ? 
  what a gem i 've missed by not speaking swedish . 
  thank you for sharing this . 
  i 'll have to save it or i 'm afraid i 'll never find it again . 
  ( googling `` sweden 's fastest 14 year old '' in english only returns one reddit thread with 0 upvotes , and a thinktank . ), 
  at least there are some examples of this `` do n't ever question migrants '' phenomenon taking a humorous and mostly harmless turn . 
  i 'm getting rather weary of ... well , everything else . 
  yeah , about that . 
  i 'm an immigrant . 
  i know homesickness . 
  i know language frustration . 
  but i 'm pretty sure i never got so homesick or frustrated that i shat on the floor and participated in mass organized sexual assault . 
  legal status , no legal status ... does n't stop anyone once they 're here . 
  if you 're on this sub regularly then surely you 've seen reports about tens of thousands of asylum seekers dropping entirely off the radar once they 're registered , while those who are formally rejected go on the lam , call in their local antifa/anarchists to physically blockade their home from the authorities , destroy the planes meant to transport them home , etc. 
  conferring or withholding some legal status never could 've stopped what went on in k\u00f6ln and elsewhere , and that 's the real problem . 
  documents mean benefits , which is another issue , but sheer presence is the problem in societies too unwilling or unable to remove anyone . 
  canada and the us have the advantage that can screen and select the refugees they fly in based on whatever criteria they want . 
  europe ? 
  they take tiny boats and walk . 
  unless you physically restrain their bodies , you ca n't stop them . 
  this is unpalatable to many people , and the resulting reluctance to enforce existing laws means the laws are meaningless . 
  north america has a built-in physical restraint : the atlantic ocean . 
  we 've got the saying , and it even rhymes !, 
   the fact that even laicist schools have embraced a pagan festivity . 
  ah , but small numbers of cultural conservatives complaining about halloween being pagan/un-christian/evil is [ just another part of the american tradition ] ( https://chick.com/catalog/tractbykeyword.asp?subject=halloween ) . 
  see ? 
  you 're already getting into the spirit !, 
  46 % and 47 % are a `` majority . '', 
  i somehow feel as if this statement reinforces what the chart 's trying to convey ... 
  not what he 's saying . 
  come on now . 
  and really ? 
  to draw attention back to the middle east is to remind everyone reading your comment that there are very rich countries indeed ( saudi arabia , uae , qatar ) that are n't doing a damn thing for their supposed brethren in peril . 
   there is no centralized `` yo , you wan na immigrate ? 
  here 's the do 's and dont 's '' , which is still baffling . 
  i do n't really know what people mean when they say this . 
  i 've been confused by the call for a new einwanderungsgesetz for the better part of a year now ... as if we do n't have anything of the sort , and as if that would fix anything . 
  i 'm an immigrant . 
  i had to fulfill a lot of requirements to get here , and i have to continue fulfilling new and ongoing requirements to stay . 
  if i go for citizenship one day , there will be even more rules . 
  i could get extremely specific about them if you like . 
  and the rules are very much centralized ( aufentg / stag ) . 
  just because there 's an ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde in each region does n't mean they 're applying regional laws . 
  this is n't federalized like education or something . 
  the kicker ? 
  ** typical immigrants and refugees are n't held to the same standards anyway .
