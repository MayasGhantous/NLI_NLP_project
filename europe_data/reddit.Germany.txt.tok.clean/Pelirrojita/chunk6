  ** making german immigration laws stricter for non-refugees will do nothing to solve the eu 's refugee problem , which is the * actual * problem . 
  it 's like changing a lightbulb when really , your whole neighborhood has a blackout . 
  you might look and feel proactive , but you accomplish nothing . 
  he has a plurality ( not majority ) of support among registered republicans , who themselves are not a majority of the voting public . 
  he leads within a segment of a segment , and a whole lot can happen in a year anyway . 
  has nothing to do with your country , race , religion , or anything . 
  if it 's german bureaucracy , it 's * always * like that . 
  and if you 're a non-eu person at the ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde , god help you . 
  i 'm a white american who immigrated a few years ago and already spoke fluent german and had a job offer before i got off the plane . 
  my various privileges got me waved through , right ? 
  i experienced literally everything you just said and then some . 
  immigrant here , can confirm . 
   no other eu - or g20 country takes more than 20.000 refugees/year , the us only 10.000 . 
  10k was obama 's pledge for ** syrian ** refugees in the fiscal year spanning 2015-2016 . 
  [ that goal was just met ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2228095fa4b643228529e544f611ea0b/10000th-syrian-reaches-us-week-resettlement-program ) . 
  the us takes in tens of thousands of additional refugees [ from other countries ] ( https://www.state.gov/j/prm/releases/statistics/251288.htm ) every year . 
  in fy2015 it was just short of 70k total . 
  there are still proposed ceilings , though . 
  [ current one is 85k ] ( https://www.state.gov/j/prm/releases/docsforcongress/247770.htm ) , which is still a small fraction of the number of people who crossed germany 's borders last year and are waiting for processing . 
  yeesh , not even americans actually like charleston chew . 
  those and mary janes are the crappy filler candy that generally only come out around halloween so that your cheapest neighbors can still claim to have offered * something * . 
  i was that kid . 
  many of the items were , gasp , even hand-me-downs or thrifted . 
  i was fine then and i 'm fine now . 
  the article is n't talking about the kind of absolute poverty that marks * no * food , * no * clothes , * no * shelter . 
  that 's the opening line , in fact . 
  it 's about not having the * best * of these things , literally citing not getting music lessons , a private tutor , and ** a year abroad ** as markers of poverty . 
  to me , this is not poverty : this is lifestyle inflation on a societal scale . 
  a year abroad , really ? 
  maybe my perception is skewed because i 'm an immigrant , but do born-and-raised germans ( or other western europeans ) * really * see these things as parts of a typical childhood rather than luxuries ? 
  vacations and vespas are the furthest things from your mind when you 're happy just to access healthcare and a decent education . 
  that was my childhood , but i 'd never call it `` poverty '' in a million years . 
   having to wear the same clothes 3 years in a row the horror !, 
   his wife is german , so he might be entitled to it ? 
  not sufficient . 
  [ among other things , there are language and residency requirements for people applying as the spouses of german citizens . 
  his kids would have an automatic claim , though . 
   afaik in germany this even allows you to vote in communal elections . 
  big caveat : this only applies to people who are already eu citizens , any of whom could naturalize into dual citizenship and vote here anyway . 
  third-staters are shut out at every level . 
  interesting to note is that [ each eu member state handles this differently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_foreigners_to_vote#european_union_.28eu.29 ) . 
   we are also the only ones so far that moved in such large numbers to another country/continent . 
  ehhh i think latinos in the us would have something to say to that . 
  i 'm with you otherwise , though . 
  my uni has a visiting professor from turkey this year , but the german summer semester/academic year is ending now . 
  the prof gave her last scheduled lecture today and commented on this very briefly . 
  she seemed like she would comply if she had to ( her guest contract ends with this semester anyway and no renewal was originally planned ) but she did not seem pleased . 
  i did n't feel it was my place to say so , but i really , really hope she does n't leave . 
  i told her `` stay safe '' and thanked her for all she 'd done all year , but i 'm scared i 'll read about her in the papers sooner rather than later if she goes . 
  does it have an oddly softer texture/lower melting temperature in the us as well ? 
  i swear the stuff 's even different from all the german butters i 've had . 
  makes it a bit of a pain for baking , where the wrong butter temp/texture can really wreck a recipe , but just to spread on bread ? 
  it 's simply to die for . 
  i 'm constantly a little shocked by how tone-deaf spiegel 's english translations are . 
  this is n't the first time , but it might be the most unfortunate example i 've seen . 
  the [ carrier mosquito does n't really live in most of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aedes_aegypti#/media/file:global_aedes_aegypti_distribution_\\ ( e08347 \\ ) . png ) , apart from * maybe * a few places along the mediterranean coast . 
  europe 's a lot less worried about zika than the americas . 
  possibilities of climate change , viral adaptation , yada yada ... but for now , we 're good . 
  amazon tried to use that excuse and succeeded for years , [ but the final domino is about to fall next week ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/the-holiday-is-over-amazon-will-collect-sales-taxes-nationwide-on-april-1.html ) . 
  amazon will collect sales tax in all us states that have a sales tax , regardless of presence . 
  that article also describes why it was never as simple as `` no presence = no tax '' to begin with , just that * collection * of said tax is very confusing and enforcement has been slow to adapt to the digital economy . 
   the entities that benefit from the sales tax are going to need to look for other avenues to finance themselves enforcing existing laws can very much be one of those avenues . 
  people have made up a '' - phobe '' smear for this now ? 
  i 'm literally from the southen us and i 've never heard this nonsense before . 
   in france they were trying to sell a combo of 6 or 7 vaccines in one shot , when only 3 of them are mandatory in france . 
  what you 're referring to is the shift from the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine ( which i had as a kid ) to the dtap-polio-hib-hepatitisb vaccine ( which my kid has had two rounds of as a baby under 6 months ) . 
  it seems there are some other combos available , but dtap-polio-hib seems to be the backbone of most versions and the one most common in germany . 
  i do n't know which of these diseases are considered ok elsewhere , but i would n't want my kid to catch or spread any of them . 
  they 're all terrible , and he woud 've been vaccinated against all six anyway . 
  it was a few decades ago , but in my case this resulted in ** 15 ** successive shots whereas now my son will only have ** 3 ** . 
  i just pulled out our little yellow books to compare . 
  what 's so shady about that , exactly ? 
   certain amount of time in germany   this can be legally and illegally [ no : ( ein ausl\u00e4nder , der seit acht jahren ** rechtm\u00e4\u00dfig ** seinen gew\u00f6hnlichen aufenthalt im inland hat ... ) ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/rustag/__10.html ) in practice , one can basically only switch over from a niederlassungserlaubnis ( which itself takes years , typically five ) or from another special status ( existing eu citizen , blue card , or married to a citizen ) . 
   fulfilling language requirements   what is it these days ? 
  it is a joke anyway !, 
  i do n't disagree with you there , but the state incentivizes higher levels of fluency by shaving a year or two off of the required residence time , from a general requirement of 8 down to 7 or 6 depending on the circumstances and individual 's attainment . 
   an immigration test   nothing special and also a joke !, 
  if you can read you can pass it also not wrong . 
  passing rates have [ hovered around 98 % ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/einb%c3%bcrgerungstest#resultate ) every year since the test was introduced . 
  ( sorry i ca n't find a link to more current data atm , but the trend holds so far . ), 
   it is required that applicants have been able to provide for themselves and their family without state support for several years and that they have n't committed any major crimes . 
    this and the rest do not make anybody a german ... it just gets you a paper with a lots of benefits for 2 weeks of learning two weeks of learning what ... ? 
  i do n't follow . 
  other posters also overlooked the general requirement to relinquish one 's original citizenship , an oath of allegiance to the democratic basic law ( part and parcel of the background check dissed above : no membership in anti-democratic institutions ) , and a general minimum of 5 years ' contributions to the state pension system or private equivalent ( required to get the niederlassungserlaubnis stepping stone in the first place ) . 
  been there , done that . 
  thanks for this . 
  when they can figure out how to convey nuance and balance in a tiny label so i know what i 'm buying , sign me up . 
  that 's a shame . 
  if i did n't already live in a city ( berlin ) that was cracking down on airbnb , i 'd be ranting at my local gov regularly to get on that . 
  it 's not the single , overnight solution to our housing crisis , and there are still plenty of people trying to get around the rules , but it 's better than nothing . 
  some of the world 's biggest tourist destinations ( paris , london , nyc ... ) have figured out that they 're well within their rights to either slap a giant tax on airbnb/vacation rentals or to restrict them outright . 
  nothing like that going on in portugal ? 
  one point further : those who are really dedicated to integrating and contributing are more likely to naturalize ( especially , i 'd imagine , in countries where naturalization typically requires first-citizenship renunciation ) , and then we go into the `` citizen '' pile instead of the `` foreigner '' pile on most metrics . 
  i 'd be interested to see numbers on the activity of naturalized citizens , but there probably are n't enough of us to make a big dent in the overall statistics shown here . 
  i really wish they 'd not shown him at all . 
  it 's france 's day , and everyone else in the video is having fun . 
  let them have it . 
  no need to show that nasty scowl every fifteen seconds . 
  some of it 's plastic , some of it 's glass , and we do [ have possibly the most well-established system of bottle reuse ( not just recycling ) in the world ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/mehrwegpfand ) . 
  still wasteful .
